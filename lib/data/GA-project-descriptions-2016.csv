,Agreement with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa [YB notes: this is not an activity..it is a new partnership…with Activities hopefully coming soon],Capacity Building,,,Supporting Africa’s 2063 Agenda that includes enabling sustainable blue economies and  the responsible extraction of geological resources.,"In first half of 2016, GRID-Arendal become an official partner of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). The commission operates via the ministries of finance and development of member states to the African Union. This new relationship with another UN agency will allow GRID-Arendal to deploy its existing expertise to different country focal points and facilitate inter-UN agency collaboration. A new agreement between the commission and GRID-Arendal will focus initially on enhancing responsible extraction of geological resources and help address climate change and water management. It will also develop a Blue Economy Programme with special focus on capacity building, innovation, communication through creation of tailor-made networks and labs aimed to sustain the development and implementation of blue economy policy frameworks at all levels. 

This new relationship involves support for UNECA’s Africa Mineral Development Centre. In June 2016, a senior officer from the centre spent three days working in Arendal. GRID is also helping to develop ideas around seabed and spatial planning and small-scale mining.",,,United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA)’s Africa Mineral Development Centre,,"Africa,"
,Peace building and Law of the Sea in West African waters,Capacity Building,Ocean Governance and Geological Resources,,This initiative builds on a 2014 joint submission to the United Nations to extend their continental shelves beyond the current limit of 200 nautical miles.,"The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed GRID-Arendal that it will continue support for West African countires awaiting a decision on their historic continental shelf submissions at the United Nations. This initiative builds on a 2014 joint submission to the United Nations to extend their continental shelves beyond the current limit of 200 nautical miles. With the help of GRID-Arendal, the countries of Cabo Verde, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mauritania, Senegal and Sierra Leone developed the first joint continental boundary submission in UN history. It followed a decade of collaboration between these countries and GRID-Arendal, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The joint submission was a concrete example of how countries with competing interests and claims can work together to find a peaceful solution to jurisdictional disputes. ",,,,,"West Africa,"
,Peace building and Law of the Sea in the Pacific Ocean,Capacity Building,Ocean Governance and Geological Resources,,This project works with 14 Pacific Islands Countries to finalise extended continental shelf boundaries. ,"Like our initiative in West Africa, this work is important because it will allow countries to develop more cooperative ways to govern their ocean territories. By using regional marine geospatial data these countries will secure rights over their maritime jurisdiction and resources by defining maritime boundaries in accordance with international law. Modern national legislative frameworks will be developed and technical personnel will be trained in marine spatial planning and improved mapping techniques.",,,,,"Marine, Pacific"

 Helping the Abidjan Convention protect the marine environment along 14,000 kilometres of coastline. ","GRID-Arendal has a long history of supporting international environmental agreements. One of our continuing activities involves supporting the work of the Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea, the Tehran Convention – the Tehran Convention. The convention was signed by Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan and focuses on the protection of the marine environment and the livelihoods, health and well-being of present and future generations around the Caspian Sea.

The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed water body on Earth. It has a unique ecosystem with 400 endemic species facing a number of threats, including coastal zone degradation, habitat destruction and pollution from oil and gas production. Hailed by the United Nations as a major contribution to peace and stability in the region, the five states are using it to implement national action plans based on a common strategy. This regional cooperation process has been managed on an interim basis by UN Environment (formerly the United Nations Environment Programme, UNEP). To succeed, the regional cooperation process requires a stable secretariat and an established institutional implementation network. GRID-Arendal assists with monitoring, assessment, reporting, information exchange, networking, research, and environmental management and administration related work. The Convention Secretariat will become permanent this year and GRID-Arendal’s support is expected to be formalised.                                                                                                          The Convention on the Cooperation in the Protection, Management, and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Atlantic Coast of the West, Central and Southern African Region (Abidjan Convention) came into force in 1984 and covers the coastal area of 22 countries – from Mauritania in the north to South Africa – along 14,000 kilometres of coastline. 

Ecosystem-based Management is an approach that aims at managing coastal and marine environments along ecological boundaries. It assumes the marine environment includes humans and looks at the values healthy ecosystems provide to people. Known as “ecosystem services” these values can be both monetary and non-monetary. This approach helps raise awareness of the importance of ecosystems ito development, as well as to inform trade-offs, planning and decision-making. In this context, it is important to provide information on the opportunities of ecosystem services recognition, as well as the costs of failing to do so. 

GRID-Arendal assists in developing skills needed to ensure that ecosystem-based management, and how to determine the value of ecosystems to people, is included in policy making. Based on the three socio-economic assessment developed for three Large Marine Ecosystem in the region, a synthesis report will highlight on the value of marine and coastal ecosystems and recommend next steps.  
",The quality of the marine environment of the Caspian Sea will be preserved and sustainable development supported in the Caspian Sea region by supporting a Convention process that functions well and allows the right decisions to be made that supports regional cooperation that fulfils the five countries’ obligations under under the Tehran Convention. ,,,,"UNEP,"
,The Mamiwata Project,Capacity building,"Ecosystems, Economies and SDGs",,"Using a model developed in other regional work, Mamiwata will use three case studies focussed on integrated ocean management in West Africa.  
","The Mamiwata project provides technical and institutional support, training-of-trainers and peer learning-based capacity building for national and local planners, decision-makers and practitioners in development planning, marine spatial planning, fisheries, aquaculture, tourism and agriculture. The secondary target group is representatives from non-governmental and private sector. 

Using a couple of pilot studies, this project will increase capacities and regional cooperation so they contribute to the enhanced management of marine biodiversity and natural resources of the ocean area of the Abidjan Convention. ",,,,,"Africa,"
,European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) [YB note: get Miles to complete],Environmental assessment,State of the Environment and Spatial Planning,,GRID-Arendal  is producing a second updated version of the Norwegian Sea bathymetric map using new data sources. ,"Bathymetry is the measurement of the depth of a sea or other waters. The EMODNet Bathymetry project is funded by the European Union to create a standard “bathymetric surface” for all European waters. GRID-Arendal is coordinating development of a “digital terrain model” (DTM) for the Norwegian Sea (Including Icelandic Sea) for inclusion in the EMODNET Hydrography Portal, a site for harmonized data on the depth of European waters. 

GRID-Arendal is coordinating existing data providers and identifying potential new sources. It is also producing the Norwegian Sea DTM to required specifications to be included in the EMODNet portal.",,,,,"Europe,"
,Environmental Crime ,Capacity building,Environmental Crime,,"GRID Arendal's Environmental Crime Programme focuses on five sectors: logging, fisheries, mining, transportation and dumping of toxic waste, and wildlife and plant poaching.","Transnational organized environmental crime is a growing threat to the state security. It increases corruption and is linked to other criminal activities such as arms and drug smuggling, and human trafficking. It is a threat to the environment and sustainable development, as well as to national economies because it cuts into revenues from natural resources. 

Among other activities, GRID-Arendal is working with a number of partners in testing methods of using satellite monitoring to track criminal activities. A project called MASTREC - for MArine and coastal satellite Services to TRack Environmental Crime activities - demonstrates how earth observation can be used to monitor potential illegal activities on the east coast of Africa. Historical Earth observation data (radar and optical) has been developed for Somalia/Middle East and Madagascar. The preliminary analysis between East Africa and Middle East has produced a list of 20 vessels of interest, possible loading/unloading areas, and a potential transhipment area along Omani coast far from harbours where illegal waste could be moving. Use of satellites to help combat illegal fishing is of great interest and GRID-Arendal discussing other potential uses with its partners. 

Other assessments are on environmental crime continue to be developed, including one on illegal logging and trade in forest products and sturgeon poaching in the Caspian Sea -- both in the Russian Federation. A story map is being developed that looks at the paths that plastic waste – legal and illegal – travels from consumers to its final destination. Some of the information in this story comes from other work GRID-Arendal has done on plastics in the marine environment. UN Environment will be using material from a preliminary report called “Digging it up: The cost of illegal mining” in an environmental crime report due in mid-2017. GRID-Arendal is assisting the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with briefings on issues related to environmental crime and conflict, along with advising specifically on the development of the new Norwegian programme on information and analysis for development, peace and security.

,Polar & Mountain Environments [YB note: this is a Programme…not sure what you want here…Bjorn can fill in maybe?],Supporting UN Environment,Polar & Mountain Environments,,,"GRID-Arendal houses UN Environment’s Polar Centre of Excellence. Recognizing there are many similarities between the poles and high mountain regions, like the Himalayas, we focus on changes in the regions covered by ice and snow. These regions are the planet’s barometer and tell us a great deal about the present and future effects of climate change.  GRID-Arendal works to draw attention to some of the most critical environmental and climatic challenges facing these regions, providing policy makers with the latest scientific evidence on climate change and options for adaptation. ",,,,,
,Himalayan Climate Change Adaptation Programme (HICAP),Supporting UN Environment; capacity development,Polar & Mountain Environments,,"HICAP aims to help enhance the resilience of mountain people, particularly women, by improving the understanding of vulnerability to change and identifying opportunities and potential for adaptation. ","GRID-Arendal works with a number of partners on mountain issues. Our main collaboration is with the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Develoment  (ICIMOD) based in Kathmandu and the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research – Oslo (CICERO). This collaboration has produced a lot of ground-breaking work that has examined the state of the Himalayan region, its changing climate and the effect that is having on the region’s people. Among the most important achievesments are the development of the Himalayan Climate and Water Atlas. Besides research and reports, the three partners have worked with UN Environment at the 2016 UN Environmental Assembly in Nairobi to lay the groundwork for a declaration signed by countries with mountain regions that establishes a new partnership to implement the Sustainable Development Goals the nations of the world agreed to in 2015. 

An important part of HICAP is turning the knowledge acquired through the programme into a format that can be used by policy makers. Several short policy briefs have been developed for specific countries and that work is continuing with examinations of the situation in Pakistan and India in collaboration with partners in those countries. 

A report titled “Payment for Ecosystem Services in the Himalayas: A Cookbook for Emerging PES Practitioners” is about to be launched. (PES are incentives to farmers, land owners and managers, similar to subsidies and taxes, designed to encourage the conservation of natural resources.) The cookbook will provide the first comprehensive, easily accessible guide to developing PES systems in the Himalayas. 

GRID-Arendal, UN Environment and ICIMOD also produce reports on the state of mountain environments around the world. Reports have been done for the Western Balkans, Central Asia, East Africa, tropical Andes and Southern Caucasus. Still to come is a report on the Hindu Kush Himalayan region.  

Finally, a Global Mountain Waste Management Outlook is being prepared that will highlight waste challenges and opportunities in the world’s mountainous regions, with a focus on developing regions. The report was commissioned by the International Environment Technology Centre in Japan and will examine urban, rural, industrial and tourism waste management issues. GRID-Arendal and UNEP-Vienna are organising a side event at the World Mountain Forum in Uganda in December where the draft will be reviewed.","High-quality science is produced and disseminate through international peer reviewed journals and tailored knowledge products. Policy makers are engaged at national, regional and global events and stakeholder dialogues. Hands-on media engagement is promoted through journalist training and grant programmes.

,ECOPOTENTIAL: improving future ecosystem benefits through earth observations  ,Communications development ,Polar & Mountain Environments,,GRID-Arendal is working with UN Environment  in a project called “Ecopotential” the goal of which is to improve the use of Earth Observation in protected area management.,"GRID-Arendal has a major role in project communications and dissemination and has prepared materials to promote the project, including a project leaflet. This includes a project leaflet which was launched at the project General Assembly in Texel. Other products planned this year include a simple show video, engaging storymaps, and a synthesis study which examines the needs of PA managers for EO products. 
",Earth observation methodology is used to define ecological status of future protected areas. New prototype products are created. Information is used in evidence-based environmental policy making.  ,,,,
,Working with Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic (Nomadic Reindeer Herders),Capacity building,Polar & Mountain Environments,,Saami Reindeer herders are feeling the consequences of lost pastures and land fragmentation caused by industrial development and other land-use changes.,"While the effects of climate change are important, for reindeer herders there is an even more pressing concern – the consequences of lost pastures and land fragmentation caused by industrial development and other land-use changes. Like other Arctic peoples, the herders are looking for ways to understand the cumulative effects of future changes to the land on which their livelihood depends.

Activities include GRID-Arendal’s Kathrine Johnsen participating in a workshop in Kautokeino in the north of Norway to assess the suitability of two mapping tools to monitor land use changes. Called RenGIS and GLOBIO3, these techniques can also be used to predict how climate, land-use and other human-induced changes will affect biodiversity in the Arctic. The results from the workshop will be used to visualize past and future changes in different locations in the region.

The next step will be to work together with herding communities to gather information to visualize the local impacts of predicted changes on reindeer husbandry. The outcome will be a refined tool that addresses the herders’ need to understand, communicate, mitigate and adapt to the impacts of current and future changes. GRID-Arendal provided expertise on reindeer husbandry and environmental change.

GRID-Arendal also helped to deliver a two-week intensive course on Biological diversity in a circumpolar indigenous perspective at the Sámi University College in Kautokeino, Norway. Over 30 students, representing seven reindeer herding peoples from Mongolia, Russia and Norway, participated. With a strong focus on traditional food preparation as a key tool for the conservation of biological diversity and knowledge, the goal of the course was to enhance the students’ ability to understand, monitor and reflect on the linkages between biodiversity conservation and the resilience of reindeer herders’ ecosystems and livelihoods.

,20 Years of Action – Indigenous Peoples at the Arctic Council,Communications development,Polar & Mountain Environments,,The Arctic Council will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2016. GRID-Arendal is working with the Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples Secretariat to develop a story map that hightlights the role Indigenous Peoples have played in the development of Arctic environmental relations. ,"One of its unique and most important features of the Arctic Council is the presence of Indigenous Peoples working directly with state representatives. Called Permanent Participants, the role Indigenous Peoples have played over the last 20 years has been decisive and has helped determine the direction and evolution of the council. 

GRID-Arendal  is working on a multi-media exhibition designed to celebrate the achievements of Arctic Indigenous Peoples as part of the 20th anniversary of the Arctic Council. The exhibition will be built around an interactive “story map” that will highlight Indigenous Peoples’ contribution to the Arctic agenda, celebrate successes and look to the future. It will also inform Indigenous communities and others about role Permanent Participants play in the evolving Arctic dialogue and reinforce the importance of Indigenous knowledge. Finally, it will educate non-Indigenous audiences about the Arctic and its inhabitants.",,,,,
,Many Strong Voices (MSV),"Capacity building, Communications development",Polar & Mountain Environments,,"GRID-Arendal and the University College London coordinate Many Strong Voices that brings together people from the Arctic and Small Island Developing States to share knowledge, tactics and stories about how they are dealing with rapid climate change. One form of story telling is Portraits of Resilience, a photography project involving young people from both regions.
","Portraits of Resilience is a photography project that works with youth and schools in the Arctic and Small Island Developing States to document the effects of climate change in their local communities. These geographically distant societies share characteristics of vulnerability and resilience, and are among the first to feel the effects of climate change.
Portraits of Resilience illustrates the ethical dimension of climate change by bringing personal stories about its impacts to the attention of decision-makers and people around the world. It shows that the people of these regions are not helpless victims of climate change and that youth have a profound sense of place and a strong desire to see their cultures and communities survive and thrive.

Led by Canadian photographer Christine Germano, Portraits includes work by young people in the Arctic communities of Shishmaref (Alaska), Unjargga (Norway), Pangnirtung (Nunavut, Canada), Uummannaq (Greenland) and Chukotka (Russia) as well as the island states of Seychelles, Fiji, Tuvalu, Samoa, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Barbuda. Exhibitions have been held in Fiji, Greenland, Denmark, Norway, Canada, South Africa, Poland and the United States at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Field Museum in Chicago.

So far this year it has been exhibited in three Canadian locations: the Vancouver Aquarium in British Columbia, the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre in Yellowknife, capital of the Northwest Territories in the North, and the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto. Reaction to the stories and photos of the young photographers has been universally positive. Further exhibitions and photo work are being planned.

""When it comes to climate change, arctic communities and small island states share similar struggles. As they feel the impacts of rising sea levels and deteriorating coastal environments, organizations like Many Strong Voices collaborate, act and innovate to achieve lasting change. Their critical work fills the gap between those affected by adverse climate impacts and the political and business leaders focused on creating big picture solutions."" Sir Richard Branson",,,,,"climate change, Indigenous Peoples, Arctic, Small Island Developing States "

205020,Climate Change and Security,,,,,"Background: The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is partner of the Environment and Security Initiative (ENVSEC) – Phase II. ENVSEC is a partnership of six international organizations – the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Regional Environment Centre for Central and Eastern Europe (REC), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as an associated partner – with specialized, but complementary mandates and expertise, that provides an integrated response to environment and security challenges. The mission of ENVSEC is to contribute to the reduction of environment and security risks through strengthened cooperation among and within countries in four regions: Central Asia, Eastern Europe, Southern Caucasus, and South-Eastern Europe. The ENVSEC Initiative - Phase II forms also part of the UNEP POW 2012–2013, Subprogramme 2: Disasters and conflicts: Project ID 00630: (21-P2) Environment and Security Initiative (ENVSEC). UNEP together with ENVSEC partners is involved in the project component entitled “Climate change and security in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Southern Caucasus ”. Objectives: 1.","Enhanced understanding and awareness of climate change as a security challenge and the consequent need for regional and transboundary cooperation in adaptation in the three regions (Eastern Europe, Southern Caucasus and Central Asia), 

2. Enhanced national and local stakeholders’ capacity to anticipate, prevent and mitigate effectively and in a timely manner potential security risks resulting from climate change. The overall action will be implemented under the responsibility of OSCE on behalf of ENVSEC in line with the provisions of the “Agreement between the European Union, represented by the European Commission and the OSCE” for a period of three years. The EU and the OSCE will oversee the implementation of this action. The objective of this concrete activity is to facilitate ENVSEC-trademark participatory assessments of links between climate-change and security in three regions, and to present the results of the assessments in a visual and practical format. The results of the regional assessments will also be used to produce a cross-regional picture of climate change-security issues and linkages.

207612,Blue Forests,"Is this assessment or capacity building, or both?",Blue Carbon,,"The Blue Forests Project paves the way to coordinated on-the-ground payment for ecosystem services (PES), carbon market schemes, or conservation agreements that really work for coastal ecosystems and that are based on those values.","Mangroves, seagrass and salt marshes are important, but often underrated, ecosystems. These ‘blue forests’ provide food from fish, they shelter villages and towns from storms, and they are also significant for our global climate by storing and sequestering carbon. This Global Environment Facility-funded (GEF) Blue Forests Project aims to address these challenges by paving the way to coordinated on-the-ground payment for ecosystem services (PES), carbon market schemes, or conservation agreements that really work for coastal ecosystems and that are based on those values. The ultimate development goal, beyond the life the project, is a set of fully functional PES or carbon market schemes in three different ecosystems (mangroves, seagrass, saltmarshes) on three different continents (South America, Africa and Asia). In practice, the Blue Forests project will build on existing activities in selected countries to ‘push’ the blue forest concept from theory to practical application. This will be accomplished through support to targeted research on carbon and ecosystem services, through analyses of possible policy interventions, and through information sharing that will help global replication of the concept. These countries show great potential for the blue forests concept to succeed due to their natural blue forests resources, the political will of the governments, and the existing activities that have already been undertaken by the project partners. If we can achieve functioning PES and carbon market schemes in these countries, then we have set the stage for up-scaling and replication around the world. This project represents a milestone event for the way we think about and finance coastal ecosystem management. In accordance with GEF direction, the small-scale interventions (or demonstration projects) are the major focus of the Blue Forests project. Specific project targets include: 1) the improved understanding of carbon and ES valuation – at the intervention sites and globally, and 2) improved management of coastal ecosystems at the intervention sites. ","Outcomes include development of guidance for implementation and on the ground demonstrations of conservation and restoration activities. It will also address the critical need to understand of blue forests through targeted research. Blue forest methodologies are adopted by the international community and increase stakeholder awareness of the blue forests concept. Lessons and experiences gained through the interventions will support the adoption of blue forests policy options and methodologies in international climate change mitigation frameworks and markets.

207721,Masters in HOME,Capacity building,Ocean Governance and Geological Resources,,"GRID-Arendal is developing a Masters Programme in Holistic Ocean Management (HOME) with Agder University in southern Norway and Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) in South Africa

","The roots of HOME are in the Norwegian supported Continental Shelf Programme (Shelf Programme), which sought to support developing countries in their efforts to delineate the outer limits of their maritime jurisdiction according to Article 76 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This support dates back to 1998 when scientists from Norway began to understand the difficulty that many developing States were likely to encounter in their effort to define their extended continental shelf. In response to a United Nations resolution and following consultation with developing States, the Shelf Programme established at GRID-Arendal in 2004. It worked with countries to enhance the technical capacities and competencies needed to complete this critical work. The success of the approach is evidenced by the approximately 64 countries that benefitted from direct training, but above all, by the successful submission by all developing states support by the Programme. The idea behind a Masters of Science in Holistic Ocean Management and Engagement has  been driven by the same sense of purpose as the Shelf Programme: to serve the needs of coastal states by working to increase competencies and capacities of national experts to address the challenges and opportunities of a dynamic ocean space. Many States recognize that lodging their continental shelf submission is only the first step in setting up effective management and governance systems that acknowledge the holistic, multi-dimensional nature and complexity of their ocean space: from legal shelf to precious coasts, securing the future of marine spaces, HOME will establish future ocean leaders that can increase knowledge of their State’s ocean space, monitor activities within that space and support the enforcement of laws and regulations.

205248,Wastewater Management in Africa,,,,,The main purpose of the project is to profile the state and trends in wastewater management and sanitation delivery in Africa through a range of communication and outreach products. The project proposes three major components as follows: •,"Information and knowledge sharing – a detailed assessment of sanitation access (including wastewater and water quality management), as well as safe drinking water provision, will be undertaken to document and provide knowledge on state and trends in Africa since 1990. Good practices that need up-scaling and replication will also be highlighted. The main delivery under this component is an Atlas of Wastewater Management, Safe Drinking Water Provision and Sanitation Access in Africa: Opportunities for Public and Private Sector Investment. Accessory products are planned under this component, including a Maps and Graphics database, Photo library, Media briefs (for both traditional media outlets and social media), and Policy briefs. 

• Legal, policy and institutional strengthening – The slow progress in meeting sanitation targets under the Millennium Development Goals is partly a result of weaknesses in the legal, policy and institutional capacities of the countries. It is envisaged that the information and knowledge component will help in the identification of policy and legal gaps and overlaps; establishing institutional capacities; and identification of investment opportunities for wastewater management, sanitation and safe drinking water service delivery. This component will result in the engagement of key stakeholders for purposes of sharing key findings and recommendations from the information and knowledge component. • Monitoring and evaluation – the project is set to deliver several goals, including science-backed policy making, a more efficient system of turning policies into actions, and a long-term goal of positive health and environmental benefits. In order to track and monitor delivery on these goals, a set of monitoring and evaluation indicators will be developed and applied during the course and post-duration of the project. Delivery of communication products is expected to catalyze the following: • provision of appropriate guidance for policy and decision-making. There are many options for addressing Africa’s sanitation challenges, ranging from those solutions that are targeted at the household level to those that seek to protect the environment. The choice of the most appropriate option depends on available knowledge; •	reduction in the time span from policy-making and service delivery. It is acknowledged that many countries in Africa have well meaning policies, but it is often a challenge turning these policies into actions for service delivery; and • ensuring that Africa reaps the social, economic and environmental dividends of improved access to sanitation services. The long-term benefits of improved sanitation will include a reduction in the prevalence of some waterborne diseases; a clean environment, especially in urban areas; and increased national economic performance as fewer staff hours are lost due to illness.	The project falls under the Transboundary Water Management Programme, which seeks to use information products to foster regional peace building and integration efforts, given the competition associated with shared resources. The overall goal of the Programme is to strengthen transboundary cooperation and build sound dialogue between the countries’ governments, academia, civil society, youth and other stakeholders.	The project is linked to UNEP’s Ecosystem Management Programme of Work, and will seek to address the outcome related to the production and marine issues: (i) Production- use of the ecosystem management approaches in countries to maintain ecosystem services, and sustainable productivity of terrestrial and aquatic systems is increased; and (ii) Marine issues: Use of ecosystem management approaches in countries to sustain ecosystem services from coastal and marine systems is increased.",,,,

203125,Mountain Waste Management Outlook,,,,,"The International Environmental Technology Centre (IETC) is a branch of UNEP’s Division of Technology, Industry and Economics (DTIE), and is located in Osaka, Japan. IETC promotes and implements environmentally sound technologies, particularly for developing countries. It was established pursuant to decision 16/34 adopted by UNEP Governing Council in 1991. Since 2011, IETC has focused on waste management issues. The UNEP Governing Council of February 2013, in its decision GC 27/12 on Chemicals and Waste Management has requested UNEP “to develop a global outlook of challenges, trends and policies in relation to waste prevention, minimization and management, taking into account the materials life cycle, subject to the availability of extra-budgetary resources and in consultation with Governments and stakeholders, building on available data, best practices and success stories, taking into account the Global Chemicals Outlook and any other relevant initiatives and taking care not to duplicate existing information, to provide guidance for national policy planning.” IETC, in collaboration with the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA), took the lead on this initiative; aiming to develop the Global Waste Management Outlook as a tool to provide an authoritative overview and analysis of policy instruments and financing models, and recommendations for action. The Outlook was developed through a two year multi-stakeholder process starting with preparatory consultations, initiation of the steering committee and the identification of the stakeholder group, and finally published in September 2015. GRID-Arendal has been contracting by UNEP as an implementing partner (IP) to lead the production of the Global Mountain Waste Outlook according to the following outputs and deliverables mentioned below.","Preparatory consultations including setting up of the team (lead authors and experts/contributors) ?

205031,MASTREC,,,,,"Project objective is to demonstrate MArine and coastal satellite Services to TRack Environmental Crime activities (MASTREC) relies then on this experience and on a partnership with GRID-Arendal, a centre collaborating with UNEP and INTERPOL in the on-going Environmental Crime project LEAF, bringing its unique capability to capture the international user requirements, explore service uptake to other sectors or terrestrial parts of the traffic routes, and promote the service results.","A strong interest for these new MASTREC services arises then from the illegal logging and forest crime in general. Use of such services for illegal fishing surveillance is also of high interest; however it has already been demonstrated in existing (CLS service in Kerguelen example) or on-going projects (MARISS and EMSA Maritime Security services). The development of illegal logging EO based services can also rely of the existing analysis performed under an End User (INTERPOL) project initiative called LEAF, and as reported in the consolidated User Requirement included in Annex C. The proposed demonstrations of MASTREC EO services will then cover as a priority subsector the Forest part of the Environmental Crime. Extensions to other subsectors (fisheries, e-waste) of marine and coastal services will however be addressed during the project, as part of a “service uptake” task. Extension to terrestrial services will also be considered within this task, to address Environmental Crime from an end-to-end perspective (from resource extraction to derived product delivery in destination countries), taking care of the status of past G-MOSAIC Security Services to be deployed within Copernicus framework.

207738,UNEP IEA Guidelines,,,,,"The practice of integrated environmental assessment (IEA) has evolved significantly since the last set of guidance which was developed by UNEP in 2007. Demands from governments have meant that IEA’s are more policy relevant, interactive and understandable by the general public. Moreover, there are additional demands for rapid and thematic assessments which may not typically undergo the same level of rigour as a full IEA. Demands from IEA practitioners are also increasing in terms of the depth of state of the environment analysis, the expansiveness of the policy response review and the scope and accuracy of the environmental outlook. The IEA community also is pushing to compile indicators-based assessments in order to provide the ability of near-real-time tracking of environmental impacts and responses. In addition, the more traditional Demand-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model for conducting IEA is being replaced by a more holistic and fluid assessment approach which recognizes that clear separation between these concepts is no longer possible. Finally, environmental goals are now being more actively linked to social and economic goals within countries and regions. The recognition that the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development cannot be realistically separated from the environmental dimensions is permeating the political consciousness of many governments, be they from developed or developing countries. The recent adoption of the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals is a clear indication of the drive towards greater integration of these three pillars of sustainable development. This project links to MFA 5a-op2.","UNEP/DEWA requires GRID-Arendal to issue a call for expertise and manage a process towards the development of updated Integrated Environmental Assessment Guidelines. More specifically the work will include managing a group of experts towards compiling recent works on Integrated Environmental Assessment (IEA) into a revised set of draft guidelines for conducting global, regional, thematic and rapid assessments. The revised guidelines should build on and consider the following: 

• The UNEP/IISD Integrated Environmental Assessment Training Manual (2007) • The Mercator Institute report on The Future of Global Environmental Assessment Making (Oct. 2014) • Recent UNEA documents outlining changes in IEA approaches • Experience from recent IEA, thematic and rapid assessment processes • Inputs from the GEO-6 Assessment Methodologies, Data and Information Group (AMDG) • Other relevant materials (e.g. IPCC, IPBES, etc.) GRID-Arendal must also be available to respond to comments from the AMDG, and the Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) as well as UNEP staff and provide revisions based on this input. It is anticipated the work will occur in three main steps: 1.	Literature review and compilation of existing findings on new methods for global, regional, thematic and rapid IEAs. 2.	Interviews with IEA practitioners and compilation of new methods, concepts and approaches into the draft guidelines documents. 3.	Incorporation of substantive comments from AMDG, HLG, SAP and UNEP review into a final document. 4.	Incorporation of IEA guidelines user comments after 5 month road test of the draft guidelines.	In support of UNEP PoW	Project document 712.1 of UNEP’s programme of work highlights the following deliverables: •	A review of best practices will be undertaken – from within UNEP and other organisations and assessments processes such as IPCC, IPBES, MA, IAC, ICSU and IRP – and a set of transparent procedures developed, particularly with regards to administrative processes, the selection of participants, the inclusion of diverging viewpoints, as well as government and peer reviews to support a wide range of environmental assessments that UNEP conducts in order to ensure that they are of the highest quality and have maximum impact. This work, along with the knowledge and experience of recognized experts, will form the basis of the proposed assessment procedures which will be provided to Member States for review and comment in time for the preparation of GEO-6. This component will be supported by additional work streams (outside of this project), namely the GEO-5 terminal evaluation and the collaborative initiative to review of large-scale IEA’s (SP7 Project 44P1).",,,,
