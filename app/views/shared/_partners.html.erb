      <div class="text -summary-alt">The UNEP Polar Centre works closely with UN Environment Programme partners at UNEP-WCMC, UNEP headquarters and regional and programme offices, and Gateway Antarctica (Christchurch, New Zealand). In general, work in the Polar Regions has a strong focus on collaboration and on science. Our partners and stakeholders include polar scientists and technologists, indigenous peopleâ€™s organizations, petroleum industry representatives, national government personnel working on international and regional programmes, parliamentarians, and environmental non government organizations. Activities are nearly always a cooperative undertaking made possible through collaboration with our various partners, and donors. This list represents some of our long-term partner institutions and agencies.</div>
