<h2>Polar Regions</h2>
<h2>The Arctic</h2>
<h3>International Co-operation</h3>
The environmental concerns of the Arctic tend to be
common and shared by all Arctic countries. While individual nations
have their own programmes for their particular parts of the Arctic,
the region is characterized, like the Antarctic, by international
co-operative policy and action.
<P>
The most extensive international Arctic co-operative programme
is the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS) adopted
by the eight Arctic countries-Russia, the United States (Alaska),
Canada, Greenland/Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Finland-in
Rovaniemi in 1991 (also referred to as the Rovaniemi Process).
A number of other countries and international organizations have
observer status in the AEPS. The objectives of the AEPS are to
protect the Arctic ecosystems; to provide for the protection,
enhancement, and restoration of natural resources; to recognize
the traditional and cultural needs, values, and practices of the
indigenous peoples; to review regularly the state of the Arctic
environment; and to identify, reduce, and, as a final goal, eliminate
pollution.
<UL>
The AEPS has established five working groups:
<P>
<LI>Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), focusing
on contaminants and their effects in the Arctic environment;
<P>
<LI>Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment (PAME),
to assess the need for further actions or legal instruments to
prevent pollution of the Arctic marine environment;
<P>
<LI>Emergency, Prevention, Preparedness and Response (EPPR),
addressing accidental pollution and emergencies;
<P>
<LI>Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF), to facilitate
initiatives to conserve the diversity and habitats of Arctic flora
and fauna; and
<P>
<LI>Sustainable Development and Utilization (SDU), with
particular reference to the use of natural resources (EEA 1996).
</UL>
At the Third AEPS Ministerial meeting, in March 1996, held in
Inuvik, Canada, the eight countries agreed to a set of work priorities
for the Arctic and to the establishment of an Arctic Council with
the involvement of Arctic indigenous communities and other Arctic
inhabitants. The Council is designed to promote co-operation and
co-ordination on particular issues of sustainable development
and environmental protection; to co-ordinate programmes established
under the AEPS; and to encourage research. Canada currently has
the lead on the Arctic Council, which was established in September
1996 (Canadian Dept. of Foreign Affairs and International
Trade, personal communication, 1996; WWF, 1996).
<P>
Subregional co-operation on Arctic issues is also ongoing, mainly
in Europe. The Euro-Arctic Barents Region has launched an initiative
to develop industry, trade, and local co-operation in the northern
regions of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and western Russia.
The initiative includes efforts to deal with industry and nuclear
waste in north-western Russia, and an environmental action plan
was adopted in 1994 as part of the larger programme.
<P>
The Arctic environmental policies currently in place (and the
activities to implement these policies) focus on environmental
protection. International agreements are a driving force for both.
A set of progressive and coherent measures exist to protect the
marine environment. Important global conventions for Arctic marine
pollution include the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution
by Dumping of Waste and other Matter (London, 1972) and the MARPOL
73/78 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution
from Ships (London, 1973, plus the 1978 Protocol).
<P>
Two further agreements relate specifically to the Atlantic and
Arctic oceans north of latitude 36&#176;N- the Oslo (1972) Convention
for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from
Ship and Aircraft, and the Paris (1974) Convention for the Prevention
of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources. These have now been
negotiated into a single legal instrument, known as the 1992 OSPAR
Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the
North-East Atlantic, which will replace the other two as soon
as it comes into force (Norwegian Ministry of Environment, 1993).
The harvesting of fish and marine mammals is addressed by a further
set of conventions, some global and others specific to northern
oceans.
<P>
The United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe's Convention on Long-Range  Trans-boundary Air Pollution
(Geneva, 1979) is considered to be an appropriate mechanism for
addressing the transfer of airborne contaminants to the Arctic.
Steps are under way to establish further protocols under this
convention to address heavy metals and discharges of persistent
organic pollutants (AMAP, 1996), both of which are a major concern
in the Arctic. A number of existing international agreements and
programmes concerning nuclear safety (EEA, 1996) should help to
minimize radioactive pollution in the Arctic.
<P>
A new, relevant international initiative, the Global Programme
of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based
Activities, was adopted by Governments in November 1995 in Washington,
D.C. (UNEP, 1995). One hundred and nine countries were represented
at the meeting, including the eight Arctic countries.
<P>
During the negotiations of the Global Programme of Action, the
need to address persistent organic pollutants, which are contaminating
all oceans including those in the Arctic, was specifically recognized.
The Secretariat of the Programme is to promote and facilitate
its implementation at the national, subregional, regional, and
global levels through, in particular, a revitalization of the
Regional Seas Programmes.
<P>
Arctic wildlife and habitats will benefit from the global conventions
that focus on biodiversity, migratory species, endangered species,
and wetlands. In addition, the Arctic is covered by some regional
agreements, such as the Berne 1979 Convention on the Conservation
of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. Polar bear
hunting is limited to sustainable levels by the Oslo 1973 Agreement
on Conservation of Polar Bears, though the Convention has been
less useful in protecting their habitats (EEA, 1996).
<P>
As mentioned in Chapter 2, all countries in the region have established
protected areas. In 1995, a total of 285 such areas covered a
little over 14 per cent of the Arctic. About half of this total
area is located in the Northeast Greenland National Park (972,000
square kilometers).
<P>
The current set of protected areas is considered inadequate to
maintain the biodiversity of the region. CAFF has recently prepared
a strategy and action plan for developing an adequate and well-managed
Circumpolar Protected Area Network incorporating the current areas.
The network, which would involve local and indigenous peoples
and their needs, concerns, and knowledge, would aim to provide
relatively strict protection to at least 12 per cent of each Arctic
ecozone (CAFF, 1996).
