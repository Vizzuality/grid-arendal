<h2>North America</h2>
<h3>Regional Initiatives</h3>
Because Canada and the United States share one of the
most extensive common borders in the world, complex transboundary
conservation and pollution issues are among the key concerns for
the region. Bilateral ministerial-level meetings and frequent
consultations at the working level are regularly held to discuss
issues of common concern. Institutional arrangements for the Great
Lakes ecosystem and joint action on acid rain have demonstrated
the effectiveness for concerted international co-operative action.
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and its accompanying
side-agreement on Environmental Co-operation (NAAEC) provide an
opportunity to strengthen the relationships between trade and
environmental policy development and to extend co-operative efforts
for mutual economic as well as environmental benefit. Mexico,
which is also a signatory to NAFTA and the NAAEC, helps to define
the environmental agenda for the region. Regionalization, in turn,
promotes awareness of national possibilities as well as respective
responsibilities for global concerns, such as climate change.
<P>
The long history of co-operation on environmental issues is exemplified
by the multiplicity of programmes under the Great Lakes Water
Quality Agreements (GLWQA). The Great Lakes-Superior, Michigan,
Huron, Erie, and Ontario-are an important part of the physical
and cultural heritage of North America and one of the most modified
and studied ecosystems in the world.  Spanning more than
1,200 kilometres, they are the largest system of fresh surface
water on earth, containing roughly 18 per cent of the world's
water supply; the basin is home to more than one tenth of the
population of the United States and one quarter of the population
of Canada.
<P>
In the 1950s, concerns arose in both countries about increasing
eutrophication, the impact of overfishing and of the parasitic
exotic sea lamprey on fish stocks and aquatic ecosystems, and
the bioaccumulation of persistent toxic chemicals in fish-eating
species. Governmental responses were formalized in a number of
agreements and conventions between Canada and the United States
as early as the 1955 Convention on the Great Lakes Fisheries and
the subsequent GLWQA of 1972 and 1978.
<P>
The GLWQA is monitored by the International Joint Commission,
an independent international organization established in 1909
to help prevent and resolve disputes between the two countries
with respect to waters that cross or lie on the boundary. Revisions
to the Water Quality Agreements have been carried out, taking
into consideration the successes as well as current concerns,
&lt;|&gt;such as control of nutrients and eutrophication, return
of certain species, plateauing of pollutant decline despite continued
reduction efforts, non-point sources of pollution, and atmospheric
inputs. Similar initiatives dealing with the Gulf of Maine on
the East Coast and Puget Sound/Georgia Basin on the West Coast
illustrate regional integrated coastal zone management in action.
<P>
In 1991, a joint Air Quality Agreement was signed to confront
the region's acid rain problem. This umbrella agreement currently
contains commitments for reductions in SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>
emissions (CEPA, 1996). Its significance and the necessity of
a transboundary approach are underlined by the fact that half
the acid rain in Canada originates in the United States (Marchi,
1996).
<P>
On the international level, both countries are addressing
the climate change issue through action plans to reduce their
greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions for the United States have
levelled off in recent years. Furthermore, at the Second Conference
of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (Geneva, July 1996), the United States announced its support
for a binding international agreement requiring the world's industrial
nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and setting a &quot;realistic,
verifiable and binding medium-term target&quot; (Wirth,
1996). Canada also called for accelerated negotiations for a legal
instrument by the end of 1997 &quot;that would encompass significant
overall reductions&quot; (EC, 1996c).
<P>
Co-operation on many fronts highlights the commitment of the people
and Governments of Canada and the United States to prevent further
environmental degradation within each country, in the region as
a whole, and internationally. Environmental protection
and conservation have long been a tradition-stemming back to the
turn of the century with bilateral agreements on the Great Lakes
and other shared ecosystems. Recently, this collaboration has
been strengthened through both Governments' commitment to meet
environmental responsibilities under NAFTA. Widespread support
from the public, non-governmental organizations, and many forward-looking
industries has been crucial in these endeavours. The use of regional
approaches by both Governments is recognition that environmental
problems are not unique to either country. And neither are the
solutions.
