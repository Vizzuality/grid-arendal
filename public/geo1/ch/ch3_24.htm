<h2>North America</h2>
<h3>New Approaches to Sectoral Environmental Policies</h3>

In both Canada and the United States, sectoral environmental
policies that address land, forest, water, biodiversity, and waste
are being developed and applied. For the most part, these initiatives
build on previously enacted legislation, pollution standards,
and monitoring programmes. An exception is the Canada Oceans Act,
now before Parliament, billed as the world's first example of
a national law and policy aimed at all aspects of oceans governance.
The act will be largely founded on  collaborative planning and
management, avoiding the confrontational approach of earlier legislation,
and solidly based on the principle of integrated resource management
and sustainable development, tempered by the precautionary approach.
<P>
<A NAME="lan"></A><b>Land Conservation</b>
<P>
The Canadian Federal Department of Agriculture, known
as Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), is expected to release
its sustainable development strategy by December 1996. With its
primary focus on land-management issues, the strategy promises
to show the improved ability of AAFC to measure the impacts of
agriculture on the environment. This ability results from environmental
assessments carried out on three of its major programmes: the
Gross Revenue Insurance Program, the Net Income Stabilization
Account, and Crop Insurance. The new sustainable development strategy
addresses a shortcoming found in the previous programmes- their
ineffectiveness in mitigating negative impacts on environmental
resources.
<P>
The number of Canadian agricultural
policies, such as the Wheat Board quota system, government-subsidized
wetland drainage, and land pricing and taxation systems, have
been criticized for placing special production pressures on all
farms regardless of site-specific environmental factors. Subsequently,
in the early 1990s, under the auspices of Canada's Green Plan,
resources to encourage site-specific resource assessments were
put into place. How effective these will be in reversing the negative
impact of main agricultural policies is yet to be assessed.
<P>
In the United States, to promote sustainable agricultural practices,
the Government is encouraging actions consistent with integrated
farming systems at the Federal and State levels. Some of the key
elements include strengthened conservation requirements, protection
of prime farmland from conversion to non-agricultural use, environmentally
friendly pest management techniques, minimization of water pollution
from animal wastes, and reduced consumption of non-renewable energy
sources (PCSD, 1996). The U.S. Conservation Reserve Program has
been credited with reducing soil erosion on croplands by more
than a billion tons a year from 1982 to 1992 (USDA, 1996).
<P>
<A NAME="for"></A><b>Forest Management</b>
<P>
Important steps have been taken in North America to
chart an effective course towards sustainable forestry management.
Under Canada's 1991 Model Forest Programme, suggested approaches
and actions are being tested in 10 sites across the nation. The
following year, Canada released a National Forest Strategy that
identified 96 actions for sustainable forestry management. Initiatives
have been taken to develop criteria and indicators of sustainable
forest development that will let Canada assess the health of its
forests (Government of Canada, 1995). The Strategy was endorsed
by all stakeholders, with Aboriginal organizations playing a leading
role (Canadian Dept. of Foreign Affairs and International Trade,
1996).
<P>
The commitment of the United States to achieve sustainable management
of all U.S. forests by the year 2000 is important but complex
since it extends to forestlands beyond the Federal Government's
direct control. A positive aspect is that surveys are
finding non-industrial private forest landowners care about the
environment and indicate they want to do the &quot;right thing.&quot;
This category of owners cares for 59 per cent of U.S. timberland
and was responsible for 41 per cent of the trees planted in the
United States in 1993 (Comanor, 1994).
<P>
<A NAME="bio"></A><b>Biodiversity</b>
<P>
Public awareness and participation are playing a key
role in the protection of biodiversity. Semi-natural areas situated
between densely populated urban land and protected wildlands are
especially important to preserve. Voluntary partnerships with
private owners of such lands are being tried as a complement to
the existing system of laws to safeguard the environment on both
public and private lands. Conservation areas and preserves are
an important basis for biodiversity protection across the region
(PCSD, 1996).
<P>
The U.S. National Biological Service was created in 1993 to provide
scientific knowledge to balance the compatible goals of ecosystem
protection and economic progress. Research needed to meet short-term,
technical, and long-term strategic needs is conducted at 16 Science
Centers and 81 Field Stations, as well as at 44 Cooperative Research
Units in 40 states (NBS, 1996).
<P>
A recent Canadian development is the establishment of a comprehensive
national network of protected marine areas. These will incorporate
existing national marine parks and wildlife reserves, and may
eventually also embrace existing marine conservation programmes
operated by the provinces (Can. Dept. of Foreign Affairs and International
Trade, 1996). Further, Canada-all levels of Government and  stakeholders-has
finalized a Canadian National Biodiversity Strategy. The Federal
and provincial environment and wildlife ministers agreed on a
national framework for protection of endangered species. Soon
Federal endangered species legislation will be introduced in the
Canadian Parliament. Both the national framework and the legislation
are the product of widespread consultation with Aboriginal groups,
non-governmental organizations, industry leaders, and private
citizens. It is hoped that through this new framework there will
be increased scope for more successful recovery programs, like
the return to Southern Canada of the peregrine falcon, which had
disappeared from this area but is now increasing in numbers due
to a Federal-provincial recovery project.
<P>
<A NAME="tox"></A><b>Toxic Contaminants, Pollution Control, and Waste</b>
<P>
 Innovative measures to tackle the problem of toxic contaminants
and waste in the environment and their effects on human health
are being implemented. (See <a href="#b3.18">Box 3.18.</a>) Risk assessment and risk
management along with the provision of complete and accurate information
to the public are considered key to dealing with harmful effects
of toxic substances on human health and the environment. Both
Governments have taken significant steps to reduce human exposure
to certain pollutants, particularly lead, mercury, and pesticides.
<P>
In Canada, efforts are currently
under way to update and improve the Canadian Environmental Protection
Act (CEPA). The assessment of health risks posed by substances
or chemicals with toxic potential and the subsequent control of
these substances are the essential concerns of CEPA. Through the
renewal of CEPA, the Government plans to shift legislative emphasis
from reacting to the toxics and pollution at the end of the pipe
to preventing the pollution in the first place. The renewed CEPA
will also emphasize a partnership between governments and citizens
by allowing citizens to start action in Canadian courts to clean
up the environment.

<a name="b3.18"></a><H3>Box 3.18.</H3> <h2>United States EPA Initiatives in Partnership Programmes
Related to Pollution Prevention and Greening Industrial Activities</H2>
<b>The Common Sense Initiative</b>
<P>
The Common Sense Initiative (CSI) involves EPA,
industry, environmental and community groups, labour, and other
Federal, State, and local Government agencies in a study of environmental
policies facing six industrial sectors in order to recommend changes
that will encourage cleaner, cheaper, smarter approaches to environmental
management. CSI is focused initially on automobile assembly, computers
and electronics, iron and steel, metal finishing, petroleum refining,
and printing. These industries account for more than 11 per cent
of U.S. gross national product and a slightly higher share of
toxic releases (EPA, 1994).
<P>
<b>The Star Program</b>
<P>
Most U.S. manufacturers of computers, monitors,
and printers have joined EPA's Star Program, which promotes equipment
that uses 50 per cent less energy, with a potential electricity
cost saving of US$70 a year per computer and printer. Nearly 90
per cent of printers and 40 per cent of computers sold in the
United States now conform with Energy Star.
<P>
<b>The Green Lights Program</b><P>
The Green Lights Program has attracted 1,612 organizations
to focus on more energy-efficient lighting. The participants achieved
an average rate of return of 25 per cent on investments and reduced
electricity bills by 40 per cent or more.
<P>
<b>Project XL</b>
<P>
Project XL is an example of how EPA may now grant
regulatory flexibility in exchange for an enforceable commitment
by a regulated entity to achieve better environmental results.
As an example, 3M Corporation's Project XL proposes to obtain
&quot;beyond compliance&quot; permits that allow for performance-based
permits, establish emission caps below existing regulatory limits,
develop a single, simplified multimedia permit, and implement
a simplified reporting system and an Environmental Management
System (EMS) verification process. Three facilities of 3M would
be covered; preliminary stakeholder meetings have been held to
gain support on this initiative and obtain input on the format
and content of emissions reporting information.

The Government hopes that this legislation will focus on preventing
pollution at its source. Also with regard to toxics, Canada has
developed a National Pollutants Release Inventory. This is now
available on the &quot;Green Lane&quot; Internet site. Information
is provided on releases and transfers of pollutants by more than
1,000 industries. Annual reports identify the most significant
substances released to the land, air, and water for Canada as
a whole and for each province (Canadian Dept. of Foreign Affairs
and International Trade, 1996). The Accelerated
Reduction/Elimination of Toxics (ARET) initiative is an example
of an effort to address quickly the adverse effects of toxic substances,
especially persistent organic pollutants, on human health and
the environment.
<P>
A good example of non-regulatory policies in action is the use
of market incentives in the field of air pollution control. Title
IV of the U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 calls for a 9-million-metric-ton
reduction in annual emissions through the Acid Rain Program. The
centrepiece of this programme is market-based allowance trading,
which lets utilities adopt the most cost-effective strategy to
reduce sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions. Affected utilities
are required to install systems that continuously monitor emissions
of SO<sub>2</sub>, nitrogen oxides (NO<SUB>x</SUB>), and other related
pollutants in order to track progress, ensure compliance, and
provide credibility to the trading component of the programme.
<P>
In Canada, under the Acid Rain Control Programme, the trading
of SO2 emissions occurs between power plants of a particular
utility in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. The programme
was formalized in 1985 through Federal-provincial agreements
with the seven provinces east of Saskatchewan. Participants agreed
to reduce their combined SO<sub>2</sub> emissions
to 1.8 million metric tons per year by 1994, but actual reductions
went beyond the target to about 1.5 million metric tons. Consequently,
total SO<sub>2</sub> emissions in
eastern Canada have been reduced by 56 per cent since 1980 (Canadian
Dept. of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, personal
communication, 1996). Trading of consumption allowances is also
being used to manage the phaseout of some ozone-depleting substances
(Draper, 1996).
<P>
Both countries have set waste-reduction targets and introduced
aggressive recycling programmes. A growing realization in the
region is that considerable money can be made by finding ways
to &quot;mine&quot; wastes. For example, in Canada, gas produced
from landfill sites is captured and sold to installations that
turn it into electricity. The volume of greenhouse gases diverted
from the atmosphere as a result of this is equivalent to removing
500,000 cars from the road every year (Marchi, 1996). There are
also some 50 non-profit and for-profit companies in Canada taking
advantage of emerging demands to stop dumping used building materials
in landfills. They sell and recycle building materials such as
doors, windows, plumbing fixtures, wood and asphalt, concrete,
and gypsum (Government of Canada, 1996).
