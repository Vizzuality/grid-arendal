<h2>Polar Regions</h2>
<h2>The Antarctic</h2>
<h3>International Agreements</h3>

With no internationally recognized state sovereignty
in the Antarctic, the international agreements of the Antarctic
Treaty System play the key role in controlling human activities
in the region. The Antarctic Treaty is central among these agreements.
It was adopted in Washington in 1959, by 12 States that had all
actively participated in the 1957-58 Antarctica Programme of the
International Geophysical Year (Argentina, Australia, Belgium,
Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Together
with an additional 14 States that have ratified the Treaty and
are also conducting substantive research activities in the Antarctic
(Brazil, China, Ecuador, Finland, Germany, India, Italy, Republic
of Korea, Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and Uruguay),
these States are known as the Consultative Parties. An Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) is convened annually to adopt
recommendations relating to the management of the polar region
south of latitude 60&#176;S.
<P>
The objectives of the Antarctic Treaty are to ensure that Antarctica
is used for peaceful purposes and for international co-operation
in scientific research and that it does not become the scene and
object of international discord. The Treaty prohibits military
manoeuvres and weapons testing in Antarctica, ensures freedom
of scientific research and information sharing, and freezes territorial
claims by Parties. The Treaty also bans the disposal of radioactive
waste within the Treaty area. Under the Antarctic Treaty, a recommendation
was made in 1964 on Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic
Fauna and Flora. These are intended to protect indigenous mammals,
birds, and plants on the continent and to prohibit the introduction
of exotic species into the region. Provision is also made for
the establishment of protected terrestrial and marine sites.
<P>
Although some seals were afforded protection under the Agreed
Measures, the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals,
which entered into force in 1978, extended that protection to
all seals inhabiting seas south of 60&#176;S. Concern over an
unregulated fishery for Antarctic krill, along with past exploitations
of whales and fur seals, resulted in the adoption of
the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources (CCAMLR). CCAMLR entered into force in 1982, and stringent
conservation measures to halt the further decline of fish stocks
were implemented by 1989 (Kock, 1994). By protecting the lower
species in the food chain and extending coverage beyond the areas
addressed by the existing agreements, CCAMLR aims to encompass
the whole Antarctic ecosystem.
<P>
Protection of the Antarctic environment is
further strengthened by the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on
Environmental Protection (the Madrid Protocol), adopted in 1991
by States Parties to the Antarctic Treaty. The protocol builds
on and rationalizes existing measures with the aim to ensure comprehensive
protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated
ecosystems, including its value as an area for the conduct of
scientific research. The Madrid Protocol has been ratified by
23 of the States that were party to its negotiation. As of November
1996, three further states must ratify the agreement for it to
enter into full international legal effect.
<P>
Key aspects of the Madrid Protocol include provisions for environmental
impact assessment, conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora,
waste disposal and waste management, prevention of marine pollution,
and the protection and management of special areas. The Madrid
Protocol prohibits mineral resource enterprises other than for
scientific research. In the interim, while waiting for the Madrid
Protocol to enter into force, States Parties to the Antarctic
Treaty have agreed to implement voluntarily, and as far as practicable,
the provisions of the agreement as adopted in 1991.
<P>
A number of global instruments that are not part of the Antarctic
Treaty System also have relevance to the Antarctic. Of particular
note is the 1946 International Convention on the Regulation of
Whaling.
