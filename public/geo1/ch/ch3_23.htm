<h2>North America</h2>

In the early 1970s, both Canada and the United States
moved swiftly to respond to public outcries about the environmental
issues in North America. In 1970, the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) was created, and in 1971, the Government
of Canada established a Federal Department of Environment,
now known as Environment Canada. In the years since these major
milestones, both countries have established strong records in
terms of the application of command-and-control policies as well
as the use of economic instruments to achieve environmental results.
<P>
Both Canada and the United States are Federal systems and, as
such, depend heavily on an effective partnership with other levels
of Government (Federal, State, provincial, and municipal). This
collaboration includes legislation, research and monitoring, and
enforcement measures to combat environmental deterioration and
protect the health and safety of their citizens and their environment.
Success on many fronts is thus largely due to efforts undertaken
at all levels of government. The United States and Canada are
widely regarded for the environmental legislation they have designed
and enacted and for the establishment of scientifically based
environmental and pollutant standards.
<P>
In recent years, concern has grown about the capacity for legislative
measures alone to deal with the delicate balancing act of environment
and economy. Conflicts over natural resources have sometimes exceeded
the capacity of established institutions, legislation, and regulations
to resolve them. Historically, many environmental regulations
were developed and applied to specific sectors for specific substances.
This fragmented approach resulted in pollution shifting rather
than pollution prevention in certain circumstances. Rather than
eliminating the substance, the pollutant would, for instance,
move from land to air to water. Further, frustration also grew
because the complex network of environmental regulatory processes
was delivering too little environmental protection at too high
a cost (EPA, 1994a).
<P>
As the more obvious problems such as eutrophication of Lake Erie
were being resolved, scientists in both countries discovered that
command-and-control regulations did not necessarily address other
stresses threatening ecological resources and general well-being
(for example, the Great Lakes ecosystem). In a recent report,
EPA expressed concern that command-and-control approaches to mitigating
pollution have sometimes proved to be blunt instruments-overregulating
in some areas, undercontrolling in others (EPA, 1996). Evidence
has been seen in the failure of regulations to halt the decline
of salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest and oyster stocks
in the Chesapeake Bay; to control toxic contamination of the beluga
whale population in the St. Lawrence River estuary; and to protect
migratory bird populations generally. Such problems underscore
the substantial limits of present knowledge of the earth's natural
systems and the ways in which human activities affect these systems.
<P>
Market incentives and participatory processes are being tried
as ways of addressing the shortcomings of command-and-control
strategies. Increased efforts have been made to use them in environmental
protection and natural resources management programmes throughout
the region. However, both the U.S. and Canadian Governments
recognize that such efforts have their own limitations and are
not universally effective in dealing with all environmental threats.
For example, measures to deal with human exposure to highly toxic
chemicals do not appear to be amenable to this form of policy
action. Many environmental problems still require compliance to
specific rules and regulations to achieve acceptable standards
and ensure protection of public health and the environment (PCSD,
1996).
<P>
Against this background, policy in North America seems to be coalescing
around three themes: first, strengthen and streamline sectoral
environmental policies; second, test the potential for more comprehensive
management and creative partnerships with local decision-makers
(businesses and communities); third, focus national research
and technology where the long-term potential for great scientific
discovery compensates for a lack of immediate commercial interest.
