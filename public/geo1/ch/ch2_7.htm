<P>

The first pan-European conference of environmental
ministers, held at Dobr&iacute;&#154; Castle, Czechoslovakia,
in 1991, requested that a comprehensive state of the environment
report be done for the whole of Europe. Prepared by the
European Environment Agency Task Force in cooperation with Governments
and intergovernmental bodies, the Dobr&iacute;&#154; Assessment
was published in 1995 (EEA, 1995a). Without indicating priorities,
the report identified the following as the 12 most significant
environmental problems of concern to Europe:
<UL>

<LI>climate change,

<LI>stratospheric ozone depletion,

<LI>the loss of biodiversity,

<LI>major accidents,

<LI>acidification,

<LI>tropospheric ozone and other photochemical oxidants,

<LI>the management of fresh water,

<LI>forest degradation,

<LI>coastal zone threats and management,

<LI>waste reduction and management,

<LI>urban stress, and

<LI>chemical risks.
</UL>

<P>
The Dobr&iacute;&#154; Assessment has been an important source
of information for this section. Additional documents that were
of use related to specific sectoral issues and supplemented the
information contained in the Dobr&iacute;&#154; report on Central
and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS). It is noteworthy that the relatively prolific and detailed
documentation available for much of the region contains frequent
references to the inadequacy of existing data for reliable environmental
monitoring and assessment.
<P>
The region is vast, covering more than a fifth of the earth s
land area and extending further than 11,000 kilometres between
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The Russian Federation makes
up more than 60 per cent of this total area. Some 15 per cent
of the world s population live in Europe and the CIS countries.
<P>
<A NAME="lan"></A><B>Land</B>
<P>
Land degradation has been identified as a crucial and
increasing environmental problem in the region, the most severe
forms being the irreversible processes of erosion, acidification,
and pollution. Soil compaction, loss of organic matter, overgrazing,
improper irrigation, salinization, and waterlogging are other,
less common forms of land degradation in the region (EEA, 1995a).
Parts of Europe also suffer from desertification. Both physical
and chemical degradation are expected to continue unless low-input
agriculture and erosion control measures are widely adopted (CEC,
1992).
<P>
Soil erosion is increasing in Europe. Mediterranean areas are
particularly susceptible, and parts of CEE and the CIS have also
been widely affected. For example, 56 per cent of agricultural
lands in Russia are subject to erosion of different
types (Min. of Env. Prot. and Nat. Res. of the Russ.
Fed., 1995a); equivalent figures for the Ukraine and Kazakstan
are 34 per cent and 42 per cent respectively (Min. of Env. Prot.
of Ukraine, 1994; Min. of Ecol. and Biol. Res., Kazakstan, 1993).
West of the Urals, an estimated 12 per cent (115 million hectares)
of the total land area is affected by water erosion and 4 per
cent by wind erosion (EEA, 1995a). Major problems include the
loss of humus, production losses, the cost of replacing lost nutrients,
and damage to areas that receive the eroded materials (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Pollution of land from a variety of contaminants (heavy
metals, persistent organic pollutants, nitrates, phosphates, artificial
radionuclides, and so on) is widespread, though the area affected
is not accurately determined. Among other effects, pollutants
may lower plant yields; enter food chains and water supplies,
rendering them unfit for human consumption; and inhibit soil micro-organisms,
thereby disturbing natural decomposition processes.
<P>
Pesticides and fertilizers are
major sources of these pollutants. Industrial processes, fossil
fuel combustion, waste and wastewater sludge disposal, and accidental
release contribute significantly (EEA, 1995a). The Chernobyl disaster
is a case in point. After the event in 1986, over 23 per cent
of the territory of Belarus alone was affected by radioactive
fallout (Republic of Belarus, 1995). Large areas remain contaminated
more than 10 years after the event, including 430,000 hectares
of the worst affected areas of Belarus, Russia, and the Ukraine,
which remain an &quot;alienation zone,&quot; and a further 9.4
million hectares of agricultural land that remain contaminated
with long-lived radionuclides (IAEA, 1996). Additional, less well-known
cases of serious radionuclide soil contamination in eastern Europe
and the CIS countries are associated with other nuclear installations
and test sites.
<P>
Other serious cases
of contamination include oil and heavy-metal pollution of soils
around abandoned military sites in the CIS countries, and oil
leakages into land and aquatic ecosystems during oil extraction
and transportation activities in western Siberia. It is estimated
that some 7-20 per cent of all oil extracted ends up in these
ecosystems (Mnatsakanian, 1994).
<P>
Acidification is frequently a transboundary problem. Whereas the
main emission sources are in north-western and central Europe,
the greatest impacts are in the industrialized, densely populated
zone that extends from Poland and the Czech Republic through Germany
and the Benelux countries to the United Kingdom and Scandinavia.
Present loads of acidic deposition are higher than critical loads
in roughly 60 per cent of Europe, with central parts of Europe
receiving 20 times more acidity than the ecosystem s critical
loads (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Sulphur deposition predominates in the more northerly countries
whereas nitrogen leaching and associated problems are typical
for central Europe and the Netherlands. Although long-term trends
in acid deposition are not yet available, there is an indication
that the Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) Convention
prepared under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission
for Europe (UN-ECE) is effectively reducing sulphur-related acidification
in the region, as discussed later in this section (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
In agricultural areas, the application of chemicals has tended
to offset acid deposition, but outside these areas the effects
are not mitigated. Acid deposition is a problem in most countries
in western Europe where soils have low buffering capacity. At
present, 30 per cent of the forested area of Europe is thought
to be degraded from this, with a further 15 per cent at risk if
acid deposition continues (EEA, 1995a). Acidification of soil
and water has been particularly serious in the Scandinavian countries
because of prevailing winds and the high natural acidity of soils
(EEA, 1995a; Bernes, 1993).
<P>
A third of Europe s 300 million hectares of drylands suffers some
degree of desertification and the reduction in biological and
economic productivity that goes with it (UNEP, 1992a). Desertified
areas are mainly uncultivated and abandoned lands (15 million
hectares), drylands (13 million hectares), and irrigated lands
(1.6 million hectares) (UNEP, 1992a). Changes in agricultural
practices, particularly the intensification of land use, are thought
to have been the prime causes (EEA, 1995a). The affected areas
are mainly in southern and central Europe and the southern parts
of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) (UNEP, 1996).
<P>
<A NAME="for"></A><B>Forests</B>
<P>
Forests cover 27 per cent of the region west of the
Urals and 35 per cent of the FSU-a total of 900 million hectares
(FAO, 1995b). Combined, they contain almost 15 per cent of the
world s forest biomass (FAO, 1995b). A large proportion of the
region s forests are in the Russian Federation (FAO, 1995b). The
region, however, has little left of its mature, biodiversity-rich
natural forest ecosystems due to centuries of exploitation (EEA,
1995a).
<P>
Since the early 1960s, Europe s total forest area has increased
by more than 10 per cent, mainly in the south and west (EEA, 1995a).
Though small in percentage terms, there have been some huge areal
increases in the east as well: from 1988 to 1993, registered forestlands
in Russia increased by 3.9 million hectares (0.33 per cent) (Min.
of Env. Prot. and Nat. Res. of the Russ. Fed., 1995a). Increases
have been due to reforestation policies and spontaneous tree growth
in marginal areas (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
While there is an overall increase in growing stock and forest
productivity in the region (FAO, 1995b), large-scale deforestation
is currently under way in the boreal forests of the Russian Federation.
Much of the logging there is fostered by large timber companies
from outside the area; the extensive timber removal is causing
serious erosion problems and habitat changes that have negative
impacts on biodiversity (EEA, 1995a). In addition, in some CEE
countries such as Georgia, thousands of hectares of mountain forests
have been felled to provide fuel (REC, 1994). However, the region
s forests are reportedly increasingly valued for their environmental
and other non-wood functions (FAO, 1995b).
<P>
Forest degradation is
of more widespread concern in Europe than deforestation. Crown
defoliation and discolouration indicate a general worsening
in forest conditions in many parts of the region, although no
reliable correlation has been established yet between tree growth
and defoliation. The forests most severely affected by defoliation
are in central, north, and south-east Europe. In a 1993 transnational
survey, 22.6 per cent of trees were found to be defoliated by
more than 25 per cent (EC/UN-ECE, 1994). Recent research has demonstrated
a number of causative factors, including adverse weather conditions,
air pollution, pests and pathogens, and forest fires rather than
just acid rain, as previously suspected (EC/UN-ECE, 1994; EEA,
1995a).
<P>
Nevertheless, a number of the most affected countries consider
air pollution the major reason for catastrophic dieback in local
areas including the Black Triangle on the borders of Poland, Germany,
and the Czech Republic; Upper Silesia in Poland; and the Kola
Peninsula and Norilsk areas of Russia (Nowicki, 1993;
Min. of Env. Prot. and Nat. Res. of the Russ. Fed.,
1993; Min. of Env. of the Czech Republic, 1996). It is believed
that emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO<SUB>2</SUB>) and nitrogen
oxides (NO<SUB>x</SUB>) from coal-fuelled power plants are largely
responsible for the 35-50 per cent of CEE forests that are damaged
or dying, while non-ferrous smelting is a major contributor to
the degradation of the Russian sites (Environmental Resources
Ltd., 1990). Fires damage some 700,000 hectares of forest each
year, mainly in parts of the FSU and southern Europe, although
in the latter area a certain frequency of burning is necessary
to maintain vegetation types like chaparral and maquis (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
<A NAME="bio"></A><B>Biodiversity</B>
<P>
Europe is estimated to have more than 2,500
habitat types, which are home to some 215,000 species, more than
90 per cent of which are invertebrates (EEA, 1995a). Many of these
species are currently threatened by extinction: 52 per cent of
fish are under threat, 45 per cent of reptiles, 42 per cent of
mammals, 30 per cent of amphibians, and 15 per cent of birds (EEA,
1995a). Of Europe s 12,500 species of higher plants, 21 per cent
are threatened, although only 27 species are known to have become
extinct (EEA, 1995a). The countries with the highest percentage
of threatened plant species are Slovakia (36 per cent), the Netherlands
(35 per cent), and Romania (at least 30 per cent) (EEA, 1995a).
In comparison with the rest of the world, the total number of
species in Europe is relatively small but the percentage of threatened
species is large (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Natural ecosystems, which sustain
a high proportion of plant and animal species, are best preserved
in the extremities of the region-the far North, parts
of eastern Europe, and the Mediterranean Basin. This latter area
boasts the highest species diversity in the region, whereas eastern
Europe has particularly high species endemism. Natural ecosystems
are sparse and fragmented in western and central Europe, which
are also the areas with the highest percentages of threatened
species (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Every country in Europe has passed legislation to protect
sites for nature conservation, though some Mediterranean and CEE
countries have lagged behind in this respect. The Russian Federation
alone has more than 65 million hectares of national parks and
<A NAME="fig2_10"></A>protected areas (IUCN, 1994). <A HREF="../fig/fig2_10.htm"> Figure 2.10</A> shows the distribution
of protected areas in Europe. The total extent of these protected
areas has increased rapidly: two thirds of the more than 40,000
sites have been designated since the Stockholm Conference in 1972,
and 10 million hectares have been added since 1982 (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
As elsewhere, forests are an important reservoir of biodiversity
and play a central role in wildlife conservation. Many countries
now protect part of their natural forest primarily for this purpose
(EEA, 1995a). Slovenia, for example, has established a network
of natural forest reserves, some of which have remained undisturbed
for more than 100 years and introduced a system of unique-habitat
&quot;eco-cells&quot; to protect particular species (A. Velkavrh,
Ministry of Environmental Protection, Slovenia, personal communication,
July 1996).
<P>
Unfortunately, the designation
of protected areas does not automatically guarantee their success;
overall in Europe, management of protected areas is considered
to be currently inadequate to retain the integrity of the ecosystems
that they represent (EEA, 1995a). It is interesting to note the
unexpected side effect of the cold war in this respect, where
nature flourished in the closed areas on the former East-West
border (UNEP, 1996).
<P>
Coastal and marine ecosystems are
habitats for an enormous number and range of species, including
millions of birds. Many of Europe s remaining marine and coastal
sites of ecological importance have no protected status; of 135
sites evaluated for the Dobr&iacute;&#154; Assessment, nearly
half were considered under threat from coastline development
(EEA, 1995a). In France, for instance, natural coastal areas are
being lost at a rate of 1 per cent a year; 15 per cent have disappeared
since 1976, and 90 per cent of the French Riviera is now developed
(EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Managed ecosystems also contain an important cross-section
of species and landscape types. Intensive, monocultural forestry
and agricultural practices have been detrimental to both types
of biodiversity, although for the most part forestry now contributes
to preserving biodiversity and habitats (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Depending on the geographical location, Europe s biodiversity
is under pressure from mass tourism (affecting coasts and mountains),
intensification of agriculture (grasslands and wetlands), deteriorating
water quality (freshwater and coastal ecosystems), forest management
geared towards economic gains (forests), and industrial, transport,
and energy policies (coasts, major rivers, and mountains) (EEA,
1995a).
<P>
<A NAME="wat"></A><B>Water</B>
<P>
Both the quantity and the quality of fresh water present
major problems over much of the region, and the issue is of growing
importance (UNEP, 1996).
<P>
Although there is no overall water shortage in Europe, water availability
<A NAME="tab2_6"></A>varies considerably. (See <A HREF="../tab/tab2_6.htm">
Table 2.6.</A>) Malta has the least water
available (100 cubic metres per person a year), while Iceland
has more than 600,000 cubic metres available a year for each resident
(EEA, 1995a). Low availability is a characteristic of the relatively
dry, southern countries of the region and those with high population
densities and moderate precipitation in the west. Some 70 per
cent of all water withdrawals west of the Urals are from surface
supplies, many of which are transboundary sources (EEA, 1995a).
Rivers are also the principal source of water in Russia although
occurrence does not closely match demand. While more than 80 per
cent of the population lives in the basins of the Caspian and
Azov seas, with high agricultural and industrial potential, these
basins contain only 8 per cent of the nation s water resources
(Min. of Env. Prot. and Nat. Res. of the Russ. Fed., 1994). Some
90 per cent of Russia s surface runoff drains to the Arctic and
Pacific oceans (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Withdrawal as a percentage
of available water resources, or water use intensity, ranges from
0.1 per cent in Iceland to more than 70 per cent in Belgium (EEA,
1995a). Annual per capita withdrawal rates range from 156 cubic
metres (Luxembourg) to more than 4,000 cubic metres (Uzbekistan
and Turkmenistan) (WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB, 1996). The breakdown
into supplies for industry, agriculture, and domestic use varies
widely; in European Union (EU) countries, the average ratio is
53:26:19 (EEA, 1995a). Total water withdrawal has stabilized or
even decreased in some countries in recent years, including Austria,
Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, and there are
some encouraging signs of increased water use efficiency due to
improved technology in industrial and agricultural sectors. On
the other hand, large amounts of water are being lost through
leakages, particularly in urban water systems where losses of
up to 80 per cent have been reported (UN-ECE, 1996). On balance,
water use is still increasing in the region (EEA, 1995a and 1995b).
<P>
The regional imbalance between water supply and demand is a major
concern, as it leads to unsustainable exploitation of water resources
in many areas. The noticeable increase in frequency and severity
of droughts in the region, possibly an early sign of climate change,
could exacerbate this situation (UNEP, 1996). Ground
water is of enormous importance for public water supplies in the
region, providing around 65 per cent of the total (EEA, 1995a).
About 60 per cent of European industrial and urban centres
are close to areas where ground water is overexploited, and some
are experiencing water shortages as a result: 25 per cent of wetlands
west of the Urals are threatened by lowered ground-water tables,
and extensive tracts of the Mediterranean, Baltic, and Black sea
coasts are suffering from salt intrusion in ground-water supplies
(EEA, 1995a). The availability of clean water for all sorts of
uses has become a topic of intergovernmental and international
disputes in the CEE countries (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Water quality is the second freshwater concern. The range of possible
contaminants and the mobility of water in the environment makes
this a complex issue. Acidification of fresh water has already
been mentioned in the context of land degradation above.
<P>
European waters tended to show
a marked increase in both phosphorus and nitrogen loadings during
the 1960s and 1970s, making them more prone to eutrophication
and toxicity (EEA, 1995a). While point sources, particularly municipal
sewage outflows, make a major contribution to phosphorus levels,
in some areas, agriculture is estimated to be responsible for
up to 80 per cent of the nitrogen loading and 20-40 per cent of
the phosphorus loading in surface waters (EEA, 1995a). Despite
a levelling off in average inputs of nitrogen fertilizer to agricultural
land and a drastic fall in countries such as Poland, nitrogen
levels have continued to rise in more than two thirds of the European
rivers measured (EEA, 1995a). In ground water, nitrate concentrations
are frequently above levels considered safe for human consumption.
Rural communities are particularly at risk from this source. However,
for phosphorus the trends have now reversed where countries, mainly
in the west and south, have taken positive measures to reduce
discharges (EEA, 1995a; WHO, 1995). The phosphorus concentration
in the Rhine is a good example of the decrease that followed efforts
initiated in the 1960s to collect and treat sewage before discharge
<A NAME="fig2_11"></A>into the river (UNEP, 1995). (See <A HREF="../fig/fig2_11.htm"> Figure 2.11.</A>)
<P>
Loadings of organic matter have decreased in many European rivers
as sewage treatment practices have improved. However, this form
of freshwater contamination is still widespread in some parts
of the region. The worst affected countries in western Europe
and CEE are Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy,
the Netherlands, and Poland (EEA, 1995a). A recent 10-year study
in the Russian Federation showed that only 21 per cent of 245
rivers were acceptable in terms of bacteriological pollution (WHO,
1995).
<P>
Incidents of diseases linked to contamination
of water supplies have been recorded in many countries, but especially
in CEE and the CIS. Drinking-water samples tested in 1990 illustrate
the widespread nature of this problem. In Belarus, 30 per cent
of samples did not meet chemical standards and 8 per cent did
not meet biological standards; equivalent figures for Uzbekistan
were 37 per cent and 15 per cent; for Turkmenistan, they were
31 per cent and 26 per cent (Info. Centre of Goskomstat, USSR,
1991). There are indications that the situation is worsening.
In Russia, 30.5 per cent of drinking-water samples from all over
the country in 1993 failed to meet acceptable chemical quality
standards and 28.25 per cent failed to reach biological ones (Min.
of Env. Prot. and Nat. Res. of the Russ. Fed., 1994). The corresponding
figures for 1980 were 15.4 per cent and 22.9 per cent (Min. of
Env. Prot. and Nat. Res. of the Russ. Fed., 1994).
<P>
Recent information shows
that the regulations introduced in response to the alarming concentrations
of heavy metals in many European lakes and rivers in the 1970s
have been effective. In general, concentrations today are well
below standards for drinking water; only mercury and cadmium exceed
drinking-water standards in some rivers. There are, however, still
some heavy-metal &quot;hot spots&quot; associated with mining
areas and industries using large quantities of metals that pose
a risk to human health. Aquatic communities may still be affected
by the lower concentrations prevailing more widely (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Ground and surface water contamination
from industrial, communal, and agricultural sources has been identified
as one of the three environmental priorities for CEE (REC, 1994).
The whole of Lake Baikal, containing 20 per cent of the earth
s fresh water, is now affected by pollutants, including oil, even
in its most remote and open parts, with only a minor amount (15
per cent) of effluents being treated satisfactorily
(Min. of Env. Prot. and Nat. Res. of the Russ. Fed.,
1994 and 1995b). In Hungary, large quantities of nitrogen annually
seep into ground-water supplies (Environmental Resources Ltd.,
1990). In the former Czechoslovakia, mining wastes, SO<SUB>2</SUB>,
nitrates from fertilizers, and oil are the main causes of water
contamination (Environmental Resources Ltd., 1990). In addition,
much of the sewage discharge is untreated. Similar situations
exist in other CEE countries and significant portions of some
major waterways are not fit even for industrial use.
<P>
The need for water treatment facilities is critical. Those that
do exist function poorly and have inadequate capacity to cope
with the level of treatment necessary. Instances of radionuclide
contamination in waters associated with nuclear installations
and nuclear waste disposal sites have also been reported for this
part of the region. The multiple functions of surface waterways,
such as the Danube, Elba, and Vistula rivers, also create conflict
among users (Environmental Resources Ltd., 1990; EEA, 1995a; REC,
1994).
<P>
Ground-water pollution is expected to become increasingly widespread
and acute in coming years, particularly because of uncontrolled
waste deposits, leakage from petrochemical tanks, and continuing
percolation of untreated sewage, pesticides, and other pollutants
into aquifers. As the already high proportion of Europe s drinking
water from this source is expected to increase, ground-water quality
is a priority issue (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Many wetland habitats have been severely disturbed by freshwater-focused
tourism and recreation activities together with the extensive
physical and chemical modification of lakes and rivers in the
region. Wildlife support functions and water purification capacities
are particularly at risk. Only a small proportion of wetlands
in the region are protected (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
<A NAME="mar"></A><B>Marine and Coastal
Environments</B>
<P>
Although the scale of problems has not been fully assessed,
the key environmental problems in European seas and coastal areas
have been identified as coastal zone pollution, eutrophication,
overexploitation of resources, and the longer-term effects of
climate change and sea level rise. In addition, important wildlife
habitats in some coastal areas continue to be degraded or lost;
one frequent consequence is the decline in populations that depend
on these habitats for reproduction and other processes.
<P>
Europe has a range of different sea types, but its semi-enclosed
and closed seas are a distinctive feature of the region. Their
basins and shores are heavily affected by human activities. The
physical characteristics of each sea, combined with the nature
and intensity of the human activities changing it, determine which
problem dominates. The seas most at risk from human activity are
the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea, and the Sea of Azov. The Mediterranean,
with its heavy imbalance in population growth, economic development,
and pollution loads between north and south shores, is also a
cause for concern (UNEP, 1996). Least affected are the North Atlantic
Ocean and the Norwegian and Barents seas (EEA, 1995a). West of
the Urals, almost 30 per cent of the population lives within 50
kilometres of coastal waters (EEA, 1995a). It is estimated that
86 per cent of the coastal ecosystems in this part of the region
<A NAME="fig2_12"></A>are at high or moderate risk from development. (See <A HREF="../fig/fig2_12.htm"> Figure 2.12.</A>)
In FSU, 62 per cent of coastlines are in the same risk categories
(WRI/ UNEP/UNDP/WB, 1996).
<P>
The most significant contaminants
in the coastal zone are synthetic organic compounds, microbial
organisms, oil, nutrients, litter, and, to a lesser extent, heavy
metals and radionuclides. They originate from a wide range of
land-based sources and activities in the marine catchment, sometimes
hundreds or thousands of kilometres away from the sea, as well
as from shipping and other offshore activities. Depending on type,
the contaminant can harm marine organisms through physical damage
or toxicity, turn bathing water and seafood into a human health
hazard, and decrease the amenity value of beaches, thereby damaging
local tourist industries.
<P>
The Black Sea and the Sea of Azov
have the largest and most populated catchments in the region.
Together with the Mediterranean, Baltic, and North seas, they
consistently receive the highest loads of land-based contaminants-loads
that are 10 to 100 times greater than those in the White, Barents,
and Norwegian seas. In these areas, catchments and catchment populations
are relatively small (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Despite these differences and recent reductions in some of the
riverine pollutant discharges [such as a 50-per-cent drop in phosphorus
and heavy metal discharges by North Sea States between 1985 and
1995 (EEA, 1995b)], pollution of coastal waters is still considered
to be a significant problem in all European seas (EEA, 1995a).
Some consider the drying up of the Aral Sea to be the world s
single greatest man-made environmental disaster (UNEP, 1996).

<H2>The Aral Sea Catastrophe</H2>

The Amu Dar'ya and Syr Dar'ya rivers,
flowing from the mountains of Tian Shan and Pamirs, are the principal
water sources for Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
and the southern part of Kazakstan. Traditionally, about half
of the water was used for irrigation and the other half flowed
into the Aral Sea. However, intensive development of irrigation,
mainly for cotton, over the last few decades reduced the inflow
of these rivers to around 3 per cent, causing severe shrinking
of the Aral Sea.
<P>
Since 1960 the Aral Sea has lost two thirds
of its volume, the surface area has halved, the water level has
dropped by 16 metres, and the salinity level is now approaching
<A NAME="fig2-2_1"></A><A NAME="fig2-2_2"></A>that of sea water. (See Figures <A  HREF="../fig/fig2-2_1.htm"> 1</A> and <A HREF="../fig/fig2-2_2.htm"> 2</A>.) Almost all the native
organisms have died out, devastating the sea-based portion of
the economy.
<P>
The 3.3 million hectares of exposed seabed have become
a source of aerosols containing salt and agricultural residues
that are then deposited by wind over surrounding areas. The resulting
poor drinking-water quality and exposure to toxic airborne substances
is believed to account for a dramatic deterioration in the health
of inhabitants in peripheral areas; significant increases in malnutrition,
diarrhoeal and kidney diseases, anaemia, cancers, and several
other health problems have all been recorded.
<P>
In 1992, the five republics came to a water distribution
agreement. In 1994, for the first time since the sea started shrinking,
there was no decrease in sea level in comparison to the previous
year. In early 1995, implementation of the Aral Sea Programme
began. It aims to:
<UL>
<LI>stabilize the environment of the Aral Sea,
<LI>rehabilitate the disaster zone around the Sea,
<LI>improve the management of international waters in
<LI>the basin, and
<LI>build the capacity of regional institutions to plan
<LI>and implement these programmes.

Bathing waters in the region s tourist resorts tend to be closely
monitored for compliance with microbial standards. Although there
are many examples of beaches being closed to bathers because of
contamination from inadequately treated sewage (EEA, 1995a), there
are also indications of improvements. Nevertheless, bathing water
contamination is still expected to result in more than 2 million
cases of gastrointestinal diseases annually in Europe in a wide
range of locations (WHO, 1995).
<P>
Eutrophication is considered a major problem in the Baltic, Black,
and North seas and locally in the Mediterranean and Caspian. Recent
evidence suggests that eutrophication of near-shore waters is
occurring more frequently and seriously than in the past in many
areas, including the Adriatic, Black, and Baltic seas; the west
coast of Sweden; and the coast of Denmark (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
While some national marine fisheries have increased annual catches
since the early 1980s, unsustainable harvesting of fish stocks
and shellfish has led to the decline of many and the
<A NAME="fig2_13"></A>collapse of several fisheries in European seas. (See <A HREF="../fig/fig2_13.htm">Figure 2.13.</A>)
North Sea catches, for example, were around 2 million tons in
1960; by the early 1970s, they had doubled to 4 million, but in
recent years they have dropped back to around 2.5 million (EEA,
1995a). In addition to the direct economic repercussions of lower
catches, overfishing and damaging fishing techniques have adverse
impacts on non-target fish species such as benthic organisms and
some cetaceans (EEA, 1995a). In the Caspian Sea, construction
of numerous dams on the Volga and Kura rivers has prevented sturgeon
fish from reaching their main spawning grounds. This has combined
with waterway pollution and more damaging fishing methods to decimate
the fish population. Landings decreased from 30,000 metric tons
in 1985 to 2,100 metric tons in 1994 (UNDP/UNEP/WB,
1995). As the catch was formerly worth around US$6 billion annually,
this has had a major impact on the economies of the riparian countries
(UNDP/UNEP/WB, 1995).
<P>
The deterioration of the Caspian Sea area, the largest landlocked
body of saltwater on earth, is a matter of great ecological and
economic significance because of its extensive reserves of oil,
gas, and populations of migrant birds and fish. The main factor
affecting the state of the ecosystem is the sea level rise, a
recurrent phenomenon throughout history, which is not yet understood.
Since the late 1970s, the Caspian has risen by about 2.5 metres
due to natural oscillations; surrounding countries are having
problems coping with this rapid and continuous change (UNDP/UNEP/WB,
1995). All five countries of the Caspian Sea suffer from inundation
of human settlements, roads, and other infrastructure (UNDP/UNEP/WB,
1995). The oil fields of Azerbaijan and Kazakstan are particularly
at risk, and flooding of these areas, of agricultural land, and
of waste dumps is posing a water pollution problem (UNDP/UNEP/WB,
1995).
<P>
Of more general concern is the potential sea level rise throughout
the region from global warming, as the costs of protecting coastlines
against inundation are likely to far outweigh any benefits from
increased agricultural yields and tourism. Additionally, changes
in sea surface temperatures and a reduction in sea ice as a result
of global warming would have profound effects on fish migration
and production patterns, particularly in the Nordic Seas (EEA,
1995a; IPCC, 1996).
<P>
<A NAME="atm"></A><B>Atmosphere</B>
<P>
Air pollution is a long-standing problem
in Europe. The large-scale concentration of people and activities
in urban/industrial areas has been accompanied by high emissions
of a wide range of air pollutants. These are supplemented by additional
pollution from dispersed sources throughout the region, including
agricultural activities. Urban air quality and long-range transboundary
air pollution are both major concerns in Europe. Air
quality is cited as the top environmental priority by the majority
of experts in CEE countries (REC, 1994). On the global level,
Europe is thought to be responsible for a high proportion of many
harmful substances being added to the atmosphere, including 36
per cent of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 30 per cent of carbon
dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>), 25 per cent of SO<SUB>2</SUB> and volatile organic compounds
(VOC), and 21 per cent of NO<SUB>x</SUB> (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
For many European cities and rural areas, the information required
to obtain a reliable timely overview of air pollution and its
effects is still not available (EEA, 1995a). Harmonized data reporting
could significantly improve understanding of current air pollution,
and reliable data are needed to monitor and verify the effectiveness
of control measures (WHO, 1995).
<P>
The main sources of emissions to
the atmosphere are fossil fuel combustion and industry, in CEE
countries, along with road transport in western cities and increasingly
in cities in the rest of the region. Fossil fuel emissions include
CO<SUB>2</SUB>, SO<SUB>2</SUB>, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, and particulate matter
(PM) as well as metals and radionuclides. In the industrial sector,
the producers of power, petroleum, chemicals, pulp and paper,
cement, steel, and non-ferrous metal are all major emitters, with
SO<SUB>2</SUB>, PM, and heavy metals being the most significant
pollutants (EEA, 1995a). Road traffic currently accounts for 80
per cent of total traffic emissions in western Europe: it contributes
over half of total NO<SUB>x</SUB>, 35 per cent of  VOC emissions,
and about 25 per cent of total energy-related CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions
(EEA, 1995a). Air transport is also a cause for concern because
of the relatively high energy consumption per kilometre travelled
and the introduction of NO<SUB>x</SUB> and CO<SUB>2</SUB> high up
in the atmosphere, which may enhance their impact on global warming
(EEA, 1995a). Other major anthropogenic sources of CO<SUB>2</SUB>
are combustion for power generation and land use change. Europe
is responsible for around a third of global CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions,
with Russia, Germany, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom being major
<A NAME="fig2_14"></A>emitters. Per capita emissions also tend to be high compared with
other regions (EEA, 1995a; WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB, 1996). (See <A HREF="../fig/fig2_14.htm"> Figure
2.14.</A>)
<P>
Industrial emission &quot;hot spots&quot;
have shifted during this century from western Europe towards the
east and south (EEA, 1995a). In CEE countries, the prevalence
of heavy industry, the intensive use of low-quality fuels, and
the substantial lack of modern production technologies have resulted
in continued high emission levels (REC, 1994). Sulphur dioxide
emissions are particularly high in the northern countries, where
brown coal is burned for energy. In contrast, southern CEE countries
typically experience lower levels of SO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions due
to a greater dependence on oil and gas for energy (Environmental
Resources Ltd., 1990).
<P>
The transboundary movement of air
pollutants is a problem leading to wet and dry deposition of
harmful substances, to smog episodes, and to reduced air quality
in locations far from their emission sources. Up to 45 per cent
of Hungary s SO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions are transported to neighbouring
countries (Environmental Resources Ltd., 1990). The atmospheric
deposition of heavy metals in Europe is generally well below emission
levels, indicating that Europe contributes to deposition outside
the region (EEA, 1995a). Airborne radioactivity is another pollutant
prone to long-range distribution. Material released into the atmosphere
from the Chernobyl accident in 1986 was measurable over practically
the entire northern hemisphere (IAEA, 1996).
<P>
During the past 20 years, successful
measures for reducing urban SO<SUB>2</SUB>, particulates,
and lead emissions have included regulations on fuel for domestic
heating (such as low sulphur content), the promotion of low and
unleaded fuel, and restrictions on the use of cars in city centres.
A series of European Community directives (see Chapter 3) to tackle
emissions of acidifying substances from transport and industry
led to a significant reduction in SO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions in many
countries (EEA, 1995b).
<P>
Parties to the Helsinki (Sulphur) Protocol of the UN-ECE LRTAP
Convention were required to bring their SO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions
at least 30 per cent below 1980 levels by 1993 (EEA, 1995a). (See
<A HREF="ch3_16.htm"> Chapter 3.</A>) These reductions have been achieved through such measures
as increased use of nuclear power, switching from coal and oil
to natural gas, emission controls on large combustion installations,
and technological improvements such as desulphurization of petroleum
<A NAME="tab2_7"></A>products. As <A HREF="../tab/tab2_7.htm"> Table 2.7</A> shows, the economic recession in CEE and
the CIS has also served to lower total emissions. Over the next
20 years, dust emissions from power generation and industry are
expected to decrease in CEE by at least 30 per cent as a result
of technological changes and a shift in fuel use (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
In contrast, European NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions have shown a slight
increase in recent years (UN-ECE, 1995). Although many countries
have made progress in reducing outputs from stationary sources
and individual vehicles, this has been offset by increased total
emissions from vehicles as overall vehicle numbers and distance
travelled per vehicle have risen. A further legal instrument under
the UN-ECE LRTAP Convention, the Sofia Protocol, addresses NO<SUB>x</SUB>
emissions and is expected to lead to overall NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions
of 20-30 per cent during the next 10 years (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
A VOC Protocol under the UN-ECE LRTAP Convention is bringing in
a stepped-up approach to controlling VOC (an ozone precursor)
emissions. It has not yet been possible to detect clear trends
in recent emissions, but the protocol should lead to a 15-per-cent
reduction in European VOC emissions by 1999, compared with levels
in the 1980s (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Poor air quality is characteristically,
though not exclusively, an urban problem. It is likely that all
cities with more than 50,000 residents have air pollution problems,
though exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines
for both short- and long-term exposures is more common in central,
eastern, and southern Europe.
<P>
Large-scale winter smog episodes,
caused by SO<SUB>2</SUB> and PM, are most common and severe in central
Europe and in all the major Siberian cities in Russia, with serious
repercussions for the health of the population. The incidence
of lung cancer among males living for an average of 30 years in
polluted parts of Cracow, Poland, was 46 per cent higher than
in residents of less polluted areas (WHO, 1995). Czech Republic
records reveal 20-30 per cent higher rates of post-neonatal mortality
in areas with high concentrations of total PM and SO<SUB>2</SUB>
(WHO, 1995). Average concentrations of the associated pollutants
are up to 10 times higher in densely populated parts of the Czech
Republic, eastern Germany, and southern Poland than in western
Europe as a result of the high use of sulphur-rich coal and lignite
for power generation and steel production (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
High tropospheric ozone concentrations (photochemical smog) tend
to develop in the summer over large areas of Europe when high-pressure
conditions prevail. The main precursors for this buildup are NO<SUB>x</SUB>
and VOC emissions. In recent years, concentrations of ground-level
ozone have exceeded the WHO air quality guideline for one-hour
average human exposure at nearly all existing European stations
(EEA, 1995a). Health problems associated with high ozone concentrations
include breathing difficulties and decreased lung function (WHO,
1995). The ozone precursors themselves can induce cancers and
respiratory diseases.
<P>
Long-term overshooting of critical values of harmful air constituents
(SO<SUB>2</SUB>, PM, benzene, heavy metals, and so on) is another
health hazard in the region (EEA, 1995a). While this problem has
been less studied, it is known that long-term exposure can affect
human health in many ways, including longevity and the incidence
of cancers (WHO, 1995). Indoor air pollution may also be a significant
health hazard, especially for old people and very young children,
but it has not yet been clearly assessed (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
On the positive side, major improvements
have occurred in the level and composition of some air pollutants
in the region s cities over the past 20 years. Concentrations
of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in most cities are lower than in the late 1970s,
in some cases by as much as 80 per cent (EEA, 1995a). As a result,
the total population experiencing pollution episodes (exceeding
250 micrograms of SO<SUB>2</SUB> per cubic metre) has decreased
dramatically during the 1980s, from 71 per cent to 33 per cent
in western countries and from 74 per cent to 51 per cent in Russia
(WHO, 1995). Many cities also show downward trends in particulate
concentrations.
<P>
In countries that have reduced
the lead content in petrol, lead concentrations have substantially
declined (EEA, 1995a). The remaining hot spots are in eastern
Europe and are associated with lead-emitting industries as well
as with leaded fuel (WHO, 1995). Regarding tropospheric ozone,
it is anticipated that implementation of the VOC Protocol should
result in a 40-60 per cent reduction in high ozone peak values
and a smaller reduction (1-4 per cent) in annual average ozone
concentration (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
West of the Urals, stratospheric ozone depletion is a cause for
concern as densely populated areas are under direct risk from
the substantial ozone decline recently detected in northern high-latitude
regions. The resulting increased ultraviolet-B radiation in the
lower atmosphere can have adverse impacts on human health (skin
cancer, cataracts, reduced immune efficiency), on terrestrial
and aquatic ecosystems (reduced species survival and productivity),
and on building materials (faster deterioration). As a region,
Europe is in a prime position to contribute to remedial action,
as it produces 35-40 per cent of the global emissions of CFCs,
which destroy stratospheric ozone (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
The increase in airborne caesium-137
levels following Chernobyl has had severe consequences. In human
terms, it is estimated that the accident had a devastating impact
on the well-being of the 600,000 &quot;liquidators&quot; who worked
to contain the spread of radioactivity immediately after the event;
in addition, up to 9 million additional ordinary people have also
been affected socially and psychologically (UNESCO, 1996). In
Belarus alone, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased five
times over the 10 years following the accident (Republic of Belarus,
1995). Genetic and other long-term effects may continue to reveal
themselves for generations in the populations of the nations affected.
Although wildlife in the vicinity of the reactor received lethal
radiation doses at the time of the disaster, no sustained severe
impacts on populations or ecosystems have been observed. Possible
long-term effects remain to be studied (EEA, 1995a; IAEA, 1996;
UNESCO, 1996).
<P>
<A NAME="urb"></A><B>Urban and Industrial Environments</B>
<P>
Some of the environmental problems that arise in urban
and industrial areas, such as air quality, aquifer contamination,
ground-water overexploitation, and land degradation, have been
addressed earlier in this section. But there are additional concerns
that tend to be closely associated with urban and industrial areas.
Waste management is one such issue. It has been identified
as a particular priority in CEE (REC, 1994), with hazardous
wastes seen as a main concern throughout the region (UNEP, 1996).
<P>
Waste generation has been on the increase in Europe and the CIS.
Many urban areas, particularly in western Europe, have introduced
measures for reducing waste and for recycling it when appropriate
and economically viable. The average European produces between
150 and 600 kilograms of municipal waste per year, with East Europeans
tending to produce less than West Europeans (EEA, 1995a). The
rate of increase in municipal waste among members of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Europe was
3 per cent a year between 1985 and 1990 (EEA, 1995a). In CEE,
the adoption of western-style consumption patterns has resulted
in an increasing amount of throwaway packaging. This, in turn,
has resulted in larger waste streams, consisting of plastics and
non-biodegradable materials, that overburden existing waste management
systems. Illegal dumping of waste exacerbates the problem in some
areas.
<P>
The growing quantities of municipal waste require new landfills
or alternative methods of waste disposal, such as incineration,
composting, reuse, and recycling (REC, 1994). In turn, these measures
may generate new problems. Incineration, for example, is instrumental
in the release into the environment of some heavy metals, like
mercury, and products of incomplete combustion, which include
highly toxic dioxins and other persistent organic compounds (EEA,
1995a).
<P>
 Agricultural and industrial
wastes are produced in even greater quantities (EEA, 1995a), a
significant proportion of which are considered to be hazardous.
For example, 80 billion tons of solid waste have accumulated in
the Russian Federation, 1.1 billion of which are toxic and environmentally
dangerous (Min. of Env. Prot. and Nat. Res. of the Russ. Fed.,
1994). Most countries in Europe have many thousands of contaminated
sites due to improper waste disposal. Several FSU countries have
a legacy of waste from industrial and abandoned military sites
that received little processing (EEA, 1995a). Large quantities
of waste, including toxic and even radioactive substances, were
just stored in the environment, often with very weak protection.
As a result, leakage and further migration of pollutants from
storage places has occurred. The worst situations are found in
northeast Estonia, the Donbas region of Ukraine, the Moscow region,
the Urals, and Kuzbas in West Siberia (REC, 1995b).
<P>
Many contaminated sites are now being cleaned up-but
at high cost. In addition, the increasing adoption of cleaner
production technologies and industrial waste minimization and
recycling is a positive trend. The disposal of hazardous wastes
continues to be a particular cause for concern. One
strategy used particularly by western European countries, which
has received much attention recently, is the export of waste to
other countries. There are two clear directions in the movement
of hazardous European wastes: from west to east within the region
and from Europe to developing countries. In 1985, OECD countries
adopted some waste movement principles that were later included
in the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous
Wastes and Their Disposal (EEA, 1995a; WHO, 1995).
<P>
Accidents are an additional threat to humans and the environment.
They are frequently linked to urban and industrial activities.
A major industrial accident reporting system has shown that most
recent accidents have occurred in the petroleum industry and that
highly inflammable gases and chlorine were the substance most
often involved. The impact of such accidents can be very widespread
if the substances permeate through food chains. Specific risks
to the environment or to human health vary according to the location
and nature of the accident, and accidental risk management must
focus on these variables (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Life in built-up areas brings with it a number of stresses not
present elsewhere-particularly those associated with air and noise
pollution and traffic congestion. Being a highly urbanized region,
a very large number of people are potentially at risk. For example,
it is estimated that more than 20 per cent of the European population
is habitually exposed to stressful noise levels (above 65 decibels)
from road traffic (WHO, 1995). The urban infrastructure also has
a bearing on human well-being. In many parts of Europe, the pattern
of urban decline prevalent in the 1980s has been replaced by programmes
of urban renewal and restructuring, to revitalize economies and
improve the quality of life. Most large cities in CEE have yet
to reach this stage, however (EEA, 1995a).<P>
