The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is proud and pleased
to present the first report in the Global Environment Outlook
(GEO) series.
<P>
This groundbreaking report presents information on the state of
the global environment. It indicates that world-wide, profound
changes continue to occur in social, institutional and economic
systems. It reports on the continued impoverishment of large parts
of the global population. It points to the increased disparities
both within and between nations. It describes the environmental
implications of rapid globalization, particularly through developments
in information technology, transport and trade regimes. It shows
us that significant progress has been made in confronting environmental
challenges at the local, national, and regional level. In the
end, though, <I>GEO-1 </I>concludes that, during the past decade,
the environment has continued to degrade and significant problems
still persist.
<P>
If there is one conclusion to be drawn from <I>GEO-1</I>, it is
that despite progress, the pace at which the world is moving toward
a sustainable future is simply too slow. Internationally and nationally,
the funds and political will dedicated to halting further global
environmental degradation are insufficient. We know that the knowledge
and technological base to solve the most pressing environmental
issues are available. However, the sense of urgency of the early
1990s is lacking.
<P>
By reporting on the state of the environment through its GEO series,
UNEP is providing the world with an essential tool to speed up
the pace of our environmental action, to set priorities, to provide
an early warning system, and to support informed decision-making
at all levels of society.
<P>
Since the Rio Conference in 1992, UNEP has broadened its scientific
focus to better address the information requirements of international
environmental policy setting and to help bridge the gap between
scientific understanding and societal action. The GEO series places
high priority on reflecting regional perceptions and realities,
while at the same time reporting on the status of the global environment.
<P>
<I>GEO-1 </I>is designed to build consensus on critical environmental
issues, setting priorities among the plethora of environmental
concerns, and identifying issues that the international community
needs to address. <I>GEO-1 </I>addresses regional policy responses
and explores the possible future state of the global environment
using a scenario of the future in which no major policy or structural
changes would be implemented-an unlikely scenario indeed, and
one which, we hope, the GEO report will help to divert.
<P>
In a single volume, and with a production time of slightly more
than one year, not every environmental issue in every region can
be covered in great detail. <I>GEO-1,</I> thus, should not be
read as a comprehensive work on the state of the environment in
a specific region. Rather, it should give the reader-whether a
policy maker, a corporate leader, a student, an activist, or an
interested citizen-a 'feel' for the priority environmental concerns
in each region and the overall health of the planet, as well as
giving a direction for possible environmental response strategies.
<P>
To promote participation and enhance distribution, UNEP is making
this report simultaneously available on the Internet in electronic
format. This is part of our commitment to improve the accessibility
of our information products, by bringing them closer to the people
that need them. At the same time, six companion technical reports
are being published. These reports enlarge on the model exercises
detailed in<I> GEO-1,</I> on alternative scenarios, and core data
sets. They also highlight the use of remote sensing imagery to
evaluate environmental changes over time over large areas, and
detail the outcomes of the regional consultations on <I>GEO-1</I>.
<P>
UNEP hopes that<I> GEO-1</I> will give a new impetus to international
action on the protection and conservation of the environment,
while at the same time promoting and caring for the development
aspirations of nations and regions. We hope that the assessment
process initiated with the Global Environment Outlook series will
find the necessary policy and scientific support to be continued
in the future, provide an effective means to link sectoral and
regional assessments, and provide an overarching framework for
ongoing international assessment activities, thus realising its
full potential.
<P>
In looking to future reports, UNEP welcomes your comments and
suggestions whether they relate to substance or style. Our goal
is that by the turn of the century a truly global participatory
assessment process may be operational to effectively keep under
review the state of the world's environment, as well as to guide
international environmental policy setting.
