<h2>Latin America and the Caribbean</h2>
<h3>International Initiatives</h3>
The Governments of the region have
strongly supported international environmental agreements to help protect the environment and
the natural resources of LAC. Among these topics, the regional ramifications and implications of
the following are of particular relevance: the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and its
commitments, the Biodiversity Convention and the property rights of genetic resources, the
Convention on Climate Change and the conservation of the regional forests, and the Antarctic
Treaty. Regional priority issues such as the sustainable management of native forests, the
restoration of degraded areas, or the establishment of biogeographic corridors at a subcontinental
level present opportunities for further international co-operation.
<p>Several countries have participated in the
development of international conventions and treaties, though many of these have not been
ratified. At the Ninth Meeting of the Region's Environment Ministers in 1995, countries confirmed
their commitment to the majority of global environmental conventions. The Ministers fully
supported the implementation of the regional application of the Desertification Convention for LAC
and the provisions of the Convention on Biodiversity. There was also support for the objectives and
actions of the Declaration of Non-Legally Binding Principles on Forests established by UNCED and
the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests, as well as for the preparation of the Protocol on
Land-Based Sources of Pollution in the wider Caribbean region, within the UNEP Regional Seas
Programme. To help combat the increase in marine pollution and the resulting drop in
fishing harvests, Governments are also promoting an action programme on land-based sources of
pollution (UNEP, 1995a).
<p>Other pre-UNCED conventions-such as
Ramsar, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna,
the Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer, and the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of
Hazardous Waste-have received the full participation of the majority of the
LAC countries.
<p>A number of innovative initiatives have also taken
place in support of environmental protection in the region. One such initiative is debt-for-nature
swaps in countries with both debt and environmental problems. These have had a mixed
reception. In countries like Costa Rica the outcome has been positive, with substantial funds
swapped for external debt being channelled into environment programmes. Other international
initiatives that have had some success include Trust Funds that have been launched in countries
such as Mexico and Bolivia for the financing and management of protected areas, which are
supported by international organizations.
