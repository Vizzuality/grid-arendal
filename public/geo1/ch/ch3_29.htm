<h2>West Asia</h2>
<h3>Regional Initiatives</h3>
<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=-1><FONT  COLOR=#008040>[</FONT> <A HREF="#reginst">Regional Institutions</A> <FONT	 COLOR=#008040>|</FONT> <A HREF="#regis">Regional Information Sharing</A> <FONT	 COLOR=#008040>]</FONT></FONT></CENTER><P>
Numerous regional institutions and initiatives deal
directly and indirectly with the environment in the West Asia
region. These are generally either associated with one of the
four seas in the region (the Mediterranean, Arabian, and Red seas
and the Persian Gulf) or with subregional groupings-the Mediterranean
subregion (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and West Bank and Gaza) and the Arabian
Peninsula region (Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen).
<P>
<A NAME="reginst"></A><b>Regional Institutions</b>
<P>
West Asian countries have made substantial joint efforts
at the regional level to help protect natural resources and the
environment. At the highest political level is the Council of
Arab Ministers Responsible for Environment and the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) Secretariat.
<P>
CAMRE adopted the Arab Declaration on Environment and Development
and Future Prospects in 1991 and agreed on principles and directives
for the protection and improvement of the environment in the region.
It established the Joint Committee on Environment and Development
in the Arab  Region (JCEDAR) to enhance co-operation and co-ordination
among Arab regional and national organizations.
<P>
Heads of States of the GCC member countries (Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) approved
environmental principles in 1985. The GCC Secretariat now encompasses
a regional Directorate of Man and Environment that organizes regional
surveys, assessments, education, and training and information
exchange at the GCC subregional level, as well as with other regional
and national institutions.
<P>
Regionally binding agreements have also led to the
establishment of regional organizations to co-ordinate implementation
efforts, such as the Regional Organisation for the Protection
of the Marine Environment (ROPME). (See <a href="#b3.19">Box 3.19.</a>) Despite
these achievements, efforts towards co-operation among regional
organizations need to be strengthened and co-ordinated. Although
there has been a growth in declarations on environmental protection,
such as the Regional Organization for the Conservation of the
Environment of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden (PERSGA), with many
involving the formulation of umbrella agreements stating the general
goals of the Parties, not all have imposed a mechanism that obliges
them to achieve the goals.
<P>
There are also many technical organizations
dealing with the regional environment, including the Arab Centre
for Studies of Arid Zone and Dry Lands (ACSAD), the Centre for
Environment and Development for the Arab Region and Europe (CEDARE),
the Programme for the Environment of the Red Sea and the Gulf
of Aden, the Gulf Area Oil Companies Mutual Aid Organisation,
the Marine Emergency Mutual Aid Centre, and other Arab specialized
organizations. Almost all provide technical assistance and respond
to capacity building needs. Universities and other research
institutions and NGOs play a supportive role in the region.
<P>
Among United Nations bodies and programmes in the region are the
United Nations Environment Programme Regional Office for West
Asia (UNEP/ROWA), the Economic and Social Commission for West
Asia (ESCWA), WHO's Regional Centre for Environmental Health Activities,
UNDP's Capacity 21, and the UNEP-initiated Mediterranean Action
Plan. There is also the Mediterranean European Technical Assistance
Programme, a regional partnership of the European Commission,
the European Investment Bank, the World Bank, UNDP, and countries
of the region that mobilize grant funds for technical assistance,
to strengthen environmental management and establish environmentally
sound policies.

<a name="b3.19"></a><H3>Box 3.19. </H3><h2>Policy in Action: the Regional Organisation for the
Protection of the Marine Environment</H2>

The Regional Organisation for the Protection of
the Marine Environment (ROPME) provides a good example of a regional
body working on multiple levels to help policy setting and planning
for the region's marine environment. ROPME was established in
1982 as the secretariat providing technical coordination to the
Kuwait Action Plan by eight member states surrounding the Persian
Gulf and Gulf of Oman (Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). Its programmes cover
environmental monitoring, management, legislation, preparation
of protocols, awareness building (especially in schools), and
training.
<P>
Among its monitoring and training work, ROPME has
supported regional laboratories to purchase equipment and has
provided training for organizations to carry out monitoring of
coastal waters. In terms of management, it has supported member
states' assessments of land-based sources of pollution. In terms
of regional legal environmental instruments and arrangements,
ROPME has prepared and adopted numerous protocols, including the
Mutual Assistance in Marine Environmental Pollution Resulting
from the Exploration and Exploitation of the Continental Shelf
(1989) and the Protocol for the Protection of the Marine Environment
from Pollution Resulting from Land Based Sources (1990). The latter
was a recognition by the member states of the urgent need to protect
the region's marine environment against pollution from land-based
sources. In 1995, the ROPME Council followed up by approving a
Regional Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine
Environment from Land-Based Activities. The programme of action
is to be implemented in parallel with the Global Plan of Action
on Land-Based Activities.
<P>
The programme of action seeks first to update surveys
of source categories, impacts, and capabilities, and second to
develop guidelines, standards, and criteria for the management
of land-based sources of pollution. The surveys are to define
the problematic contaminants and sources of pollution and to identify
vulnerable resources and areas of concern in the region. The guidelines
are designed to prevent, reduce, and control pollution of the
marine environment through regulations on pollution abatement
through source control. The Programme is also developing a river
basin management programme for the major rivers of the region,
which contribute significant amounts of contaminants and sediments
into the ROPME sea area. This involves Syria and Turkey in addition
to ROPME member states. Finally, the programme is completing a
pilot study on persistent organic pollutants-their manufacture,
use, and effect on the ROPME region.
<P>
ROPME's mandate at a high political level, the cross-cutting
nature of its work, and its ability to tailor global agreements
and action plans into programmes relevant to the region have made
it a success in the field of environmental policy setting and
action planning for the marine environment in the region.

<A NAME="regis"></A><b>Regional Information Sharing</b>
<P>
The lack of general data and information
at a national level is echoed at the regional level. Although
some regional organizations have initiated actions for information
management and networking, the dissemination and accessibility
to data banks remains insufficient and there needs to be improved
co-ordination among relevant organizations.
<P>
Among the limited existing initiatives are the Arab
Environmental Information Network, initiated by CAMRE and JCEDAR,
with technical support from CEDARE and UNEP/ROWA. Other
initiatives include the ACSAD's arid zones and drylands information
network,  ROPME's database development, and UNDP's Sustainable
Development Networking Programmes. The Mediterranean Action Plan
also has a mechanism for information dissemination that plays
an important role in the promotion of the implementation of the
Plan by its contracting parties (including Lebanon and Syria).
<P>
Regional technical organizations also have some limited information
management and networking. For example, ACSAD has published, jointly
with UNESCO, the hydrogeological map of the Arab region and the
adjacent areas. It is also preparing a water resources database,
including an integrated data base management system that stores
and retrieves data related to the assessment of water resources
in the region.
<P>
At present, various plans exist for the creation of a World-wide
Web site under the auspices of one of the regional organizations
to help increase information dissemination in the region. Each
country would then provide information for the site, which could
be a basis for sharing information and experience. The centre
for monitoring and administering the Web site could also be the
information centre for standardized data collection and analysis
of all environmental data for the West Asia region. Reports could
be produced and distributed in hard copy as well as through the
Web site (UNEP, 1996).
