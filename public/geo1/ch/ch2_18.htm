<P>
Currently, the principal environmental concerns in Antarctica
are related to changes occurring at the global level rather than
at any originating from human activities within Antarctica itself.
Those considered of most significance relate to depletion of the
ozone layer and climate change. It is only in the recent past,
however, that the Antarctic marine environment was subjected to
uncontrolled, unsustainable, and profound disturbances by commercial
exploitation of whale and seal stocks, leading to near-extinction
of some species. While commercial exploitation is now prohibited,
the impacts from this overexploitation are still evident in the
marine ecosystem today. In comparison to these changes and the
global changes noted, the environmental impacts of human activities
occurring within Antarctica today are relatively minor and localized.
Yet even these remain of concern because of the high scientific
and aesthetic value to be derived by maintaining Antarctica as
far as possible in a relatively undisturbed state.
<P>
<A NAME="ice"></A><B>Ice Sheets and Ice Shelves</B>
<P>
More than 87 per cent of the earth's fresh water exists
in a frozen state. The Antarctic ice sheet, together with the
fresh-water ice shelves that extend from the edges of the sheet
over the sea surface, contain more than 90 per cent of this frozen
water (Meier, 1983). If all of this water melted, it would be
equivalent to a sea level rise of some 60-72 meters (Drewry and
Morris, 1992).
<P>
Small changes in the mass of large ice sheets have widely recognized
implications for the global climate system and for sea level.
The most up-to-date evaluation suggests that the Antarctic ice
mass is decreasing (Jacobs and Hartmut, 1996), although further
investigation is needed before a reliable statement can be made.
The breaking away of icebergs from the edges of the ice sheet
is the largest single cause of the reduction (Jacobs et al., 1992),
followed by ice shelf melting (Jacobs and Hartmut, 1996).
<P>
Recent research on the Antarctic Peninsula has shown that steady
ice shelf retreat has been occurring there over the past 50 years
(Skvarca, 1993; Ward, 1995; Vaughan and Doake, 1996; Rott <I>et
al.,</I> 1996). Five northerly ice shelves on the Antarctic
Peninsula have retreated dramatically during this period, perhaps
in response to atmospheric warming (Vaughan and Doake, 1996).
The recent dramatic collapse of the Larsen Ice Shelf implies that
after an ice shelf retreats beyond a critical limit it may  collapse
rapidly (Rott <I>et al</I>., 1996). Ice shelves do appear
to be sensitive indicators of climate change and, indeed, long-term
warming trends on the Antarctic Peninsula are so large that they
appear to be statistically significant (Stark, 1994; King, 1994).
<P>
<A NAME="sea"></A><B>Sea Ice</B>
<P>
<A NAME="fig2_27"></A>Winter temperatures
in the Antarctic fall so low that huge areas of sea are frozen
over. This sea ice varies in extent from 4 million square kilometres
in late summer (February) to almost five times that area in late
winter (September) (Fullard <I>et al.</I>, 1990). (See <A HREF="../fig/fig2_27.htm"> Figure 2.27.</A>)These large seasonal fluctuations, together
with the fluctuations in Arctic sea ice, play an important role
in global climate by affecting exchanges of energy and water vapour
(Wadhams, 1991).
<P>
An analysis of global ice cover between 1978 and 1994 detected
no statistically significant change in Antarctic sea ice while
Arctic sea ice seems to have decreased by 5.5 per cent (Johannessen
<I>et al.</I>, 1995). However, significant reductions
in summer sea ice in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the Amundsen
and Bellinghausen seas are consistent with a warming climate west
of the Antarctic Peninsula (Jacobs and Comiso, 1993).
<P>
<A NAME="liv"></A><B>Living Resources</B>
<P>
The Antarctic is globally distinct in terms of biodiversity,
although it is inhabited by a relatively small number of different
species. Among the fauna are 120 species of fish, 72 cephalopod
(mainly squid) species, and about 50 species of birds, 35 of which
breed in the region. What the Antarctic lacks in variety, however,
it often makes up for in sheer numbers. There are estimated to
be 200 million individual birds, 65 per cent of which are penguins.
<P>
There are diverse communities of benthic flora where the bottom
of the ocean is too deep to be disturbed by ice. However, few
plant species can exist on land in the Antarctic. The terrestrial
flora is dominated by lower plants, including 350 identified species
of lichen and a green algae that grows on snow and ice, giving
the surface a red appearance. Only two species of flowering plant
grow south of latitude 60&#176;S.
<P>
The marine ecosystem, which contains most of the Antarctic flora
and fauna, is characterized by short food chains from phytoplankton
through krill to large mammals or birds. These short food chains
make the Antarctic marine ecosystem very fragile and susceptible
to disruption.
<P>
The krill, which occupy a central
position in the food chain, are crucial to the stability and sustainability
of the Antarctic ecosystem. Krill are tiny, shrimp-like
crustaceans found in Antarctic waters. Some 85 species have been
identified, the most numerous being <I>Euphausia superba</I>.
They form the main food for five species of whale, three species
of seals, and 20 fish species as well as squid and bird species.
Estimates of the Antarctic krill stock range from 500 million
to 750 million metric tons.
<P>
Krill attract a large number of whales to the region. As a result,
Antarctic waters support a more extensive stock of whales than
any other part of the world's oceans. The state of Antarctic whale
stocks is of major concern after an extensive period of whale
hunting by humans. With the exception of a very few species, there
is considerable uncertainty over the numbers of whales of different
species and in different geographical stocks. Because of this
uncertainty, the International Whaling Commission (IWC),
established by the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation
of Whaling, only publishes data on species for which there is
high statistical probability. Estimates for the late
1980s put the total number of blue whales in the Southern Hemisphere
at around 460 and minke whales at around 760,000 (IWC, 1996).
Seals, the other major mammalian group in the Antarctic, are estimated
to number some 10 million individuals.
<P>
No estimates are currently available for Antarctic fish or cephalopod
stocks.
<P>
<A NAME="con"></A><B>Contamination</B>
<P>
Many pollutants originating in the industrial and populated
areas of the world are transported to the Antarctic by atmospheric
and ocean circulations. They include chlorofluorocarbons, which
cause ozone depletion (discussed later in this section), radioactive
debris from past atmospheric nuclear bomb tests and accidents,
heavy metals, and hydrocarbons. At present, contamination levels
are generally extremely low, and the area therefore presents an
ideal laboratory for monitoring background pollution in studies
on long-range transport of pollutants (Wolff, 1990 and 1995; Cripps
and Priddle, 1991). In addition, because the ice preserves a historical
record of the atmosphere, ice core studies can reveal global changes
in trace gases and in some pollutants such  as lead. Studies have
indicated, for example, a 10- to 20-fold increase in lead concentrations
from pre-industrial times to 1980, followed by subsequent decreases
that can be linked to the increasing use of lead-reduced fuels
around the world (Wolff, 1990 and 1992; Wolff and Suttie, 1994).
<P>
There have also been incidents of local accidental release of
pollutants. A case in point was the release of 600,000 litres
of diesel fuel into Arthur Harbour, Antarctic Peninsula, as the
ship <I>Bahia Paraiso</I> sank in 1989 (Kennicutt and
Sweet, 1992). Although isolated to date, such incidents could
increase as travel to the Antarctic becomes more popular.
<P>
<A NAME="ozo"></A><B>Ozone Depletion</B>
<P>
The discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole necessitated
a major revision in theories of stratospheric chemistry. While
stratospheric ozone loss had been predicted (Molina and Rowland,
1974), the magnitude of the ozone depletion over Antarctica, first
identified in 1985 (Farman <I>et al</I>., 1985), was
not. During 1978 to 1987, the ozone hole grew, both in depth (total
ozone loss in a column) and in area. The growth was not linear
but seemed to oscillate within a two-year period (Lait <I>et al</I>.,
1989). The hole shrank dramatically in 1988, but in
1989-91 was as large as in 1987. The Antarctic ozone holes of
1992 and 1993 were the largest ever, although this was
due in part to natural causes, specifically enhanced ozone-destruction
by sulphate aerosols from Mount Pinatubo (WMO, 1995a).
<P>
In 1995, the ozone decline started earlier than in any previous
year, while the rate of decline was the most rapid on record (WMO,
1995b). Measurements over the South Pole during September and
October 1995 showed that there was nearly complete destruction
of ozone at altitudes between 15 and 20 kilometres. At the same
time, total ozone values over Antarctica were extremely low.
<P>
Increased surface solar UV-B, attributable to the depletion of
stratospheric ozone, poses a threat to Antarctic ecosystems. UV-B
is detrimental not only for primary terrestrial colonizers such
as cyanobacteria and algae but also for lichens and mosses, higher
plants, invertebrates, and marine organisms (Wynn-Williams, 1994).
One study on productivity of phytoplankton in the marginal ice
zone revealed an overall decrease of 6-12 per cent where phytoplankton
were exposed to increased UV-B concentrations (Smith <I>et al</I>.,
1992). While this overall loss is not large, the cumulative effect
on the marine community is not yet known. In terms of ecological
consequences, the displacement of UV-sensitive species by UV-tolerant
ones is likely to be more important than a decline in overall
productivity (McMinn <I>et al.</I>, 1994).
<P>
The growth rates of several major ozone-depleting substances in
the atmosphere have now slowed, demonstrating the expected impact
of the 1987 Montreal Protocol and its subsequent amendments and
adjustments (WMO, 1995a). (See also Box 2.4.) However, a substantial
Antarctic ozone hole is expected to occur during every southern
hemisphere spring for many more decades as stratospheric chlorine
and bromine concentrations very slowly decline and begin to approach
the levels of the late 1970s during the next century. Only if
the restrictions controlling chlorine and bromine emissions are
maintained can we expect the Antarctic ozone hole to disappear.

<H2>The Ozone Success Story</H2>
The protection of the Earth's ozone layer is one of the most inspiring stories in the annals of international environmental diplomacy. The thinning of the protective ozone layer poses a great danger to the health and well-being of people and ecosystems around the world; it threatens human skin, eyes, and immune systems, damages plants and animals; and poses unknown hazards to the planet's climate. To halt this thinning, action against a range of highly diverse (and profitable) industrial chemicals is required, chemicals that have helped to bring what are now commonplace products into the homes of millions - refrigerators, aerosol sprays, insulating and furniture foams. The action has brought onto the global stage a vast array of players; scientists, industrialists, and diplomats, all working together in pursuit of a common goal - the protection of the ozone layer. It is a story of painstaking investigations, courageous decisions, hard-fought negotiations, and last minute compromises. And it is not yet over.
<P>
This success story of international environmental diplomacy was possible because science and industry, stimulated by the clear objectives of the Montreal Protocol, have been able to develop and commercialise alternatives to ozone-depleting chemicals. The 1995 Vienna meeting marked the end of the initial phase of the ozone regime, which concentrated on identifying ozone-depleting substances, agreeing on control measures, and phasing out substances in industrialized countries. Attention is now turning increasingly to issues of implementation in developing countries and countries with economies in transition, and to dealing  with new emerging problems such as the first cases of non-compliance and the growth in illegal trade.
