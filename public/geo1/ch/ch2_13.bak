<P>
The West Asia region [Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan,
Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Syria, United Arab Emirates (UAE), West Bank and Gaza, and Yemen] represents
a diverse group of countries and territories surrounding four
regional seas-the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian
Sea, and the Red Sea. The countries are characterized by great
differences of surface area, natural resources endowment, population,
income, and level of socio-economic development.
<P>
All West Asian countries are located in the arid and
semi-arid zones, with more than 70 per cent of the region being
arid (UNEP/WHO, 1991). The region is characterized by low, unpredictable,
and variable rainfall, and by high evaporation rates. Most of
the rainfall occurs during winter, with the summer lasting 5-9
months each year. There is considerable rainfall variability,
making it difficult to plan for rain-fed agricultural
activities (UNEP/WHO, 1991).
<P>
The countries face serious problems of environmental degradation
that must be addressed immediately because failure to act now
will greatly compound the cost and complexity of later remedial
efforts, and because environmental degradation is beginning to
pose a major threat to human well-being, especially among the
poor in the region.
<P>
The West Asia region has varied environmental
priorities and concerns; the major ones identified by the West
Asia Region (UNEP, 1996) are:

<UL>
<LI>land degradation, desertification, and deforestation;
<LI>management of marine and coastal environments and their resources;
<LI>development and management of water resources;
<LI>human settlements;
<LI>conservation of biodiversity;
<LI>industrial pollution; and
<LI>toxic chemicals, and hazardous and radioactive wastes.

</UL>

<P>
Of these, the most pressing environmental concerns have been identified
as development and management of water resources, the management
of marine and coastal environments and their resources, and land
degradation and desertification.
<P>
<A NAME="lan"></A><B>Land</B>
<P>
Land degradation is a common problem throughout most
of West Asia, resulting both from natural environmental factors
and from the misuse of land. Periodic droughts along with extensive
pressure from overgrazing, uncontrolled cultivation, fuelwood
gathering, wind-blown soil materials, inappropriate
use of irrigation water, uncontrolled urbanization, and sand encroachment
have all contributed to the process of land degradation
in the region (LAS/UNEP, 1992).
<P>
<A NAME="fig2_22"></A>More than three quarters of West Asia is desert, and
an increasing part of the permanent pasture areas is subject to
erosion because of reduced vegetation cover (LAS/AOAD, 1995b).
Additionally, much of the cropland is losing its inherent productivity
due to poor agricultural practices. (See <A HREF="../fig/fig2_22.htm"> Figure 2.22.</A>) The direct
loss of agricultural land is most acute in Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon,
the Syrian Arab Republic, and Yemen, where fertile land
is scarce and concentrated in the narrow coastal strip and river
valleys (ESCWA, 1995). In the irrigated areas close to the main
urban centres in Jordan, Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon, and the Syrian
Arab Republic, established agricultural land is being lost to
alternative uses, including urbanization, industrialization, and
transport infrastructure. To compensate for this, new land is
being brought into production through reclamation. The productivity
of the reclaimed land, however, is in many cases only a fraction
of the old, and new land is being brought into production more
slowly than old land is being lost.
<P>
In Lebanon, land degradation is most acute on fragile steeplands
with extensive deforestation and soil erosion (Government of Lebanon,
1996).
<P>
Overgrazing in desert areas is a major cause of plant
cover loss, particularly in the northern regions of Saudi Arabia
and the southern parts of Oman. Countries such as Bahrain
have also lost substantial vegetation cover as a result of urbanization
(UNEP/ESCWA, 1991a). The coastal plains of
Oman have suffered a particularly severe loss of vegetation as
a result of overgrazing, off-road vehicles, construction, and
tourist activities (UNEP/ESCWA 1991).
<P>
Dry land salinity, mainly due to
high evaporation, is another serious problem, particularly in
the low-lying parts of West Asia. In Iraq, for example, salinity
and waterlogging are problems in more than 50 percent
of the lower Rafidain Plains (El-Hinnawi, 1993).
<P>
Fragile, marginal lands cover extensive areas in West Asia and
constitute an important resource for animal husbandry. Rapid change
in life-styles and the introduction of modern production systems
in such areas have triggered an increasing imbalance between the
exploitation of such areas and their carrying capacity. This has
led to increasing land degradation and desertification, with negative
impacts on traditional life-styles of nomads and desert inhabitants
(UNEP, 1991). Existing statistics for Yemen show that the average
annual rate of cultivated land abandoned due to soil degradation
has increased from 0.6 per cent in 1970-80 to about 7 per cent
in 1980-84 (UNEP, 1991).
<P>
Desertification and land degradation, including soil erosion,
have implications for the region's food security. West Asia had
a food gap estimated at US$10.7 billion in 1993, up nearly 4 per
cent from the previous year (FAO/ESCWA, 1994). With increased
desertification coupled with the high population growth rates,
this food gap will increase dramatically in the future, along
with the high levels of dependency on food imports for most countries
of the region (FAO/ESCWA, 1994).
<P>
<A NAME="bio"></A><B>Biodiversity</B>
<P>
Indigenous plant and animal life in West Asia is under
increasing threat due to the impact of development (LAS/UNEP,
1992). Overgrazing and mismanagement of rangelands have led to
the loss of natural plant cover. Deforestation is now a major
concern in the highlands of Yemen, Oman, and Jordan. Overfishing,
pollution, and destruction of habitat (from land reclamation and
filling in of wetlands) have all had a negative impact on marine
biodiversity. As a result, declining fish and shrimp harvests
have become a common feature in the Persian Gulf region (ROPME/IMO,
1996).
<P>
The depletion of underground water levels on the western side
of the Gulf is leading to the loss of a unique ecosystem of natural
fresh-water springs, affecting large numbers of plants and animals.
This ecosystem was once widely distributed in the eastern province
of Saudi Arabia and in Bahrain (UNEP, 1996). The Azraq Oasis in
Jordan was declared a wetland under the RAMSAR Convention because
it was endangered due to the overextraction of ground water. The
overextraction is not only depleting the ground water, it is leading
to increased salinity, which in turn negatively affects wildlife
and plant species in the area.
<P>
In West Asia, wildlife such as fallow deer, ostrich,
wild goat, and antelope have been threatened with extinction due
to indiscriminate hunting. The threat to wildlife is
worsened through the destruction of their habitats, particularly
deforestation. The region lost 11 per cent of its remaining natural
forest during the 1980s, and natural forest cover now averages
less than 1 per cent of the total land area (FAO, 1995b).
<P>
On the whole, there is little information on species, and good
data are generally limited to certain mammals and birds. Species
inventories are currently being undertaken in a number of countries
in the region [such as Jordan and some Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) countries].
<P>
<A NAME="wat"></A><B>Water</B>
<P>
<A NAME="tab2_12"></A>Water availability in the West Asia region depends on
the physiographical and hydrogeological setting. Iraq, the Syrian
Arab Republic, and Lebanon have relatively dependable surface
water sources in the form of rivers and springs. (See <A HREF="../tab/tab2_12.htm"> Table 2.12.</A>)
This supply is supplemented through extraction from ground-water
reserves in Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, and West Bank and Gaza.
Jordan is faced with water deficits, with demand outstripping
supply. West Bank and Gaza, with limited surface water and renewable ground-water
reserves, also faces problems in meeting water needs, particularly
in view of the unbalanced use of available water resources. The
Euphrates and Tigris rivers in Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic,
the Orients and Latani rivers in Jordan and the Syrian Arab Republic,
and the lower Jordan River in Jordan represent major water sources
for domestic, industrial, and agricultural requirements within
these countries.
<P>
In contrast, the GCC countries and Yemen are characterized
by a harsh desert environment devoid of rivers and lakes. The
water resources consist of limited quantities of runoff resulting
from flash floods, ground water in the alluvial aquifers, and
extensive ground-water reserves in deep sedimentary formations.
Some of these countries also rely on non-conventional
water sources such as desalinization of sea and brackish water
and limited use of renovated wastewater. Ground water in the shallow
aquifers in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, and Yemen is the only renewable water source in
these countries.
<P>
Water requirements for all sectors in Iraq are met mainly from
river flow, while Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, and
West Bank and Gaza use ground water to satisfy water demand. The major
problem associated with the management of renewable water, particularly
rivers, is its transboundary nature. The lack of formal
agreements for sharing rivers such as the Euphrates have created
shortcomings in the efficient utilization of water. The problem
is also apparent for ground-water resources, with the Palestinian
territories, for example, unable to use the totality of their
renewable resources.
<P>
<A NAME="tab2_13"></A>Total water demand for agriculture, industrial,
and domestic purposes in West Asia in 1990 was about 82 billion
cubic metres. (See <A HREF="../tab/tab2_13.htm"> Table 2.13.</A>) Agriculture accounts for the bulk
of water use, followed by the industrial sector. The agricultural
sector uses approximately 68 billion cubic metres of water, while
the water demand for industrial activities in the region reached
6 billion cubic metres. Domestic water demand accounts for about
7.7 billion cubic metres (ESCWA, 1995).
<P>
Human water consumption per capita in the region, including
for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, is now very high,
ranging from 300 to 1,500 litres per day (UNEP/WHO, 1991). Rapidly
rising incomes in some countries, with the resultant increase
in living standards, and water losses in the network have led
to higher per capita water consumption. Intensive agriculture
under arid conditions is also demanding an ever-increasing quantity
of water.
<P>
Based on current trends, water
shortage is expected to increase as a result of increased demand
and limited renewable supplies in most West Asian countries. Current
water resources such as perennial surface water, renewable ground
water, desalinization, and reclaimed wastewater are insufficient
to meet expected demand.
<P>
On the basis of the past
experiences of the moderately developed countries in arid zones,
renewable fresh-water resources of 1,000 cubic metres per capita
per year have been proposed as an approximate benchmark below
which most countries are likely to experience chronic water scarcity
on a scale sufficient to impede development and harm human health
(WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB, 1996). By this measure, many countries in West
Asia suffer from water scarcity, with Bahrain having less than
18 per cent of the minimum threshold (WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB, 1996).
Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Yemen
all have water resources below 1,000 cubic metres per capita per
year (WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB, 1996).
<P>
<A NAME="fig2_23"></A>Existing wastewater treatment facilities
face difficulties in handling the ever-increasing volumes of wastewater
generated by higher water consumption and urbanization. Wastewater
discharge from major urban centres is polluting shallow alluvial
aquifers and coastlines. The quality of drinking water and sanitation
services in most West Asian countries is poor, although it is
improving in some cases. Efforts to achieve water quality
targets established for urban areas are encouraging, but rural
communities remain inadequately serviced in terms of safe drinking
water, sanitation facilities, and accessibility.<B> </B>(See <A HREF="../fig/fig2_23.htm"> Figure
2.23.</A>)
<P>
Poor sanitation and sewage treatment
systems, in addition to industrial wastes, are increasingly affecting
water quality in the region. Access to safe drinking water and
sanitation services in the cities of West Asia is relatively good.
However, only 20 per cent of urban wastewater is treated
(World Bank, 1994). Concentrated industrial development is leading
to pollution problems for ground and surface waters in certain
areas (UNEP/WHO, 1991).
<P>
In some areas, irrigation is resulting in salinization and degradation
of soils. Overexploitation of ground-water resources is therefore
a major concern in the region, causing a decline in ground-water
levels as well as a deterioration of water quality.
<P>
Water salinity is also a concern throughout
the region. With the dropping of water tables due to excess harvesting
of ground water, salt-water intrusion becomes a serious problem.
Sea-water intrusion into the aquifers of Bahrain,
Oman (Batenah Plain), and UAE is particularly severe. Total soluble
salts measured in the ground water at different sites
in the United Arab Emirates exceeded 10,000-20,000 milligrams
per litre (UNEP/ESCWA, 1991b). It is estimated that the saline
interface between sea and ground waters advances at the rate of
75-130 metres a year in Bahrain (UNEP/ESCWA, 1991a).
<P>
The region is thus characterized by the anomaly of high per capita
consumption and very limited fresh-water resources (UNEP/WHO,
1991). The increasing pressure on all the water resources
of the region, in terms of quality and quantity, combined with
the increasing demand for water, will lead to serious water shortages
in the near future.
<P>
<A NAME="mar"></A><B>Marine and Coastal Environments</B>
<P>
Most of the GCC subregional population resides along
the coast, with population densities ranging from 605 (Oman) to
5,700 (Kuwait) persons per square kilometre (UNDP, 1993). In addition,
for many countries in West Asia, the marine environment is an
important source of development. Besides offshore oil resources
and fisheries, the coastal areas in some countries constitute
important sites for industries and tourism. These areas and marine
environments have come under increasing pressure, and the degradation
of the ecosystem has adversely affected both fisheries and tourism,
one of the largest sources of foreign exchange revenue for several
countries (LAS/UNEP, 1992; World Bank, 1994).
<P>
Oil pollution in the region is
very pronounced. In addition to the danger of oil spills from
ship and pipeline accidents, chronic pollution occurs from disposal
at sea of oil-contaminated ballast water and dirty bilge, sludge,
and slop oil. Some 1.2 million barrels of oil are spilled into
the Persian Gulf annually (ROPME/IMO, 1996). The Gulf and Red
Sea ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to oil pollution: the
low rate at which sea water is flushed through these systems suggests
that natural cleansing processes are slow (ESCWA, 1991). These
problems are compounded in many countries by the lack of adequate
port facilities for handling wastes from oil tanks and for cleaning
up oil spills (ESCWA, 1991).
<P>
The Red Sea and the Kuwait/Oman areas probably receive
more oil pollution than anywhere else in the world (GESAMP, 1990).
At the same time, the Mediterranean accounts for 17 per
cent of global marine oil pollution, even though it constitutes
only 0.7 per cent of the global water surface (ESCWA, 1991). It
has been estimated that in 1986 alone, nearly 3 billion tons of
wastes (mostly ballast waters) were discharged into the Persian
Gulf (ESCWA, 1991).
<P>
<A NAME="fig2_24"></A>Fisheries are one of the most important resources in
the GCC countries, particularly in the UAE and Oman, with annual
fish production in the region of 298,000 tons in 1994 (LAS, 1995c).
There has been a sharp decline in fish harvests in some countries
over the past few years due to overexploitation and inadequate
fisheries management, land reclamation and coastal dredging, excessive
trawling, and increased marine pollution from waste
discharge and oil pollution (UNEP, 1990; ROPME/ IMO, 1996). (See
<A HREF="../fig/fig2_24.htm"> Figure 2.24.</A>) Mangroves and associated intertidal areas and marshes
are under increasing threat in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and are
rapidly declining in other GCC countries as a result of infilling
and reclamation. The geographic concentration of industrial
complexes in coastal and estuarine areas around the Arabian Peninsula
means that many pollutants are deposited directly into the sea
(UNEP/WHO, 1991).
<P>
In summary, the coastal zone is an invaluable economic resource
for development and tourism. It is regarded, however, as having
one of the most fragile and endangered ecosystems in the world
and is seriously affected by severe sources of pollution, by stress
through deliberate and accidental oil spills, by sewage and industrial
wastewater discharges, and by commercial shipping.
<P>
<A NAME="urb"></A><B>Urban and Industrial Environments</B>
<P>
<A NAME="tab2_14"></A>In the past two decades, the cities of West
Asia have seen the most radical transformation ever experienced.
The urban growth rate in the region was 4.2 per cent between 1990
and 1995 (UN, 1994b). The high rate of growth has been fuelled
by massive rural to urban migration, prompted by rural poverty
and degradation of agricultural land, itself a consequence
of overcultivation and overgrazing and induced by a
general increase in the region's population. Almost 70 per cent
of the population is estimated to be living in urban areas (UN,
1994c). (See <A HREF="../tab/tab2_14.htm"> Table 2.14.</A>) This unplanned migration
has caused deterioration of the environment in urban areas (LAS/UNEP,
1992). It has also caused a marked deterioration of natural
resources in rural areas due to increasing neglect of agricultural
lands (LAS/UNEP, 1992).
<P>
Historically, cities have grown
alongside the fertile lands that supported them and consequently
have expanded onto them. Prime agricultural land has therefore
had to support structures and road networks in a region where
fertile agricultural land is very scarce.
<P>
The most pressing environmental
problem facing big cities in the region relates to waste management.
As populations grow at an unsustainable rate, sewerage and other
waste disposal systems are unable to cope with the volume, and
environmental degradation sets in. The crowding of the poor in
communities lacking infrastructure and decent housing leads to
an accumulation of waste, which leads to contamination and attendant
health hazards.
<P>
The region also faces urban air pollution problems. Industries
owned or subsidized by the public sector have little access or
incentive to adopt cleaner technologies. Protective trade regimes
and the lack of environmental regulations have permitted the survival
of old, highly polluting industries. Obsolete vehicle engine technology,
low fuel efficiency, leaded gasoline, and high sulphur fuels have
exacerbated urban air pollution (World Bank, 1994). Changes, however,
are occurring. In Oman, for example, new industries are obliged
to comply with environmental standards before they are established
(UNEP, 1996).
<P>
Industry plays an increasing role in social and economic development
in West Asia and also constitutes a major source of pollution
in the region. Much of the industry is highly concentrated in
few locations in most countries in the region and has led to areas
of potentially severe industrial pollution of surface and ground-water
bodies. Uncontrolled discharge of industrial effluents, undetected
seepage of toxic substances into aquifers, and the unprotected
dumping of hazardous wastes are increasing as rapidly as industry
expands (UNEP/WHO, 1991).
<P>
There is serious potential environmental degradation arising from
toxic chemicals and hazardous and radioactive wastes. The phosphate
industry, for example, is associated with environmental problems
such as the contamination of water as a result of wastewater from
the washing of phosphates. This could potentially contaminate
ground water. Gypsum, a by-product of the fertilizer industry,
contains radioactive elements that affect ground water, as well
as harmful heavy metals such as cadmium. In Jordan, phosphate
residue is reported to cover up to 60 per cent of the total area
(Tell, 1996).
<P>
The potential risks of radioactive waste resulting from armed
conflict in the area cannot be underrated. Possible accidental
radioactive leakage from nuclear reactors in the region, such
as from the Daimora reactor in Jordan, could have serious regional
environmental impacts (Tell, 1996).
<P>
Pesticide and herbicide use needs to be monitored because pesticide
disposal is leading to edible-product contamination. Pesticide
imports need to be controlled and should satisfy specified standards
and meet the best technology standards.
