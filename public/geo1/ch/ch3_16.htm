<h2>Europe and CIS Countries</h2>
<h3>Regional Initiatives</h3>
The first European environment
programme of the European Union, the Environmental Action Programme (EAP), was adopted in
November 1973 as a follow-up to the 1972 Stockholm Conference. Its main principles were
incorporated into the 1987 amendments to the 1957 Treaty of Rome (the 1987 Single European
Act). The EAP was updated and extended in 1977, 1983, 1987, and 1992, and
implementation of the Fifth EAP for the EU is still ongoing. It emphasizes a dual and co-ordinated
approach in which high environmental standards set through regulations for almost all pollutant
emissions, discharges, and wastes are combined with positive incentives for industry. The latter
aim to further improve performance through development of new processes, products, and
techniques. The Maastricht Treaty, adopted in 1994, spells out a comprehensive agenda for
sustainable, non-inflationary growth in ways that demonstrate respect for the environment. More
than 200 instruments, regulations, and directives have been called into play to improve
environmental quality throughout Europe and to counter transnational and global ills.
<p>After the changeover from centrally planned
economies, and in order to create a framework for expanded co-operation, steps were taken to
pave the way for the &quot;Environment for Europe&quot; process. The first pan-European
Conference of Environmental Ministers took place at Dobr&iacute;&#154; Castle, then in
Czechoslovakia, in 1991, attended by 36 ministers. The Dobr&iacute;&#154; Conference
requested the preparation of the pan-European Dobr&iacute;&#154; Assessment and the
development of an environmental programme for the whole of Europe. Further conferences in this
process took place in Lucerne, Switzerland, in 1993 and in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1995. The
next conference will take place in Aarhus, Denmark, in 1998.
<p>At the Lucerne Conference,
environmental ministers from 50 countries endorsed the short-term Environmental Action
Programme for Central and Eastern Europe (EAP/CEE). The programme-developed by an
international task force composed of the European Commission, the World Bank, the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the EU-provides a methodology for
integrating environmental concerns into the economic transition in the CEE region. There are three
major programme components: setting priorities, strengthening institutional capacity, and
developing cost-effective financing for environmental action. International mechanisms for
environmental cost-sharing and the effective co-ordination of assistance under this programme
have yet to be developed.
<p>The EAP/CEE places considerable emphasis on
the human health consequences of environmental degradation. In particular, drinking-water
contamination and lead and particulate pollution are key short-term concerns. Opportunities for
implementing low-cost measures to address these concerns have been identified. Based on an
assessment of a number of &quot;hot spots&quot; in the CEE countries, the EAP/CEE
recommended specific &quot;win-win&quot; investments that would benefit both the economy and
the environment. For example, phasing out subsidies on energy, raw materials, and water
can encourage conservation, thereby reducing waste and pollution.
<p>Since the Lucerne Conference, national
environmental policy documents have been prepared in 13 CEE countries, some of which are
national environmental action plans that adopt the EAP/ CEE methodology. Institution-
strengthening is considered the weakest component in most countries. The environmental
priorities identified are drinking-water supply, air pollution control, and wastewater treatment (REC,
1995b). Regional Environment Centres (RECs) are now assisting with the implementation of the
EAP/CEE. The REC in Hungary, for instance, is working with 15 CEE countries. Since its
establishment in 1990, it has awarded more than 2,000 grants to environmental NGOs in CEE to
increase public participation in environmental issues. Since the Sofia Conference, the REC
network is being expanded to the CIS.
<p>The Sofia Conference issued the Sofia Declaration,
reaffirming Governments' commitment to co-operate in the field of environmental protection in
Europe (UN-ECE, 1995). It acknowledged that, although progress is being made in a number of
areas, many serious problems remain, and it stressed the urgent need for further integration of
environmental considerations into all sectoral policies. The Conference endorsed the
Environmental Programme for Europe (EPE), based on the Dobr&iacute;&#154; Assessment. The
EPE is linked to Agenda 21 and regional environmental treaties and conventions, and describes
the actions required to address, at the European level, the following major sets of issues:
<UL>
<p><LI> general issues (including information,
public participation, and capacity building);
<p><LI> cleaner production and efficient use of
energy and materials;
<p><LI> sustainable consumption and
production patterns;
<p> <LI> sustainable management of natural
resources;
<p><LI> biological and landscape diversity; and
<p><LI> sustainable agriculture, forestry, and
fisheries.
</UL>
<p>Thus the EPE encompasses all the environmental
issues of concern to Europe in a long-term perspective, constituting the first set of general
objectives in the environment field adopted at the pan-European level.
<p>A number of East-West
initiatives are under way to assist countries undergoing economic transition with their
environmental agendas. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-
ECE) is active in fostering East-West dialogue and co-operation on environmental
matters. It has developed a number of regional environmental conventions in the fields of
transboundary water, industrial accidents, and air pollution as well as being active in the
preparation of ministerial conferences. The EU has a range of co-operative programmes, including
PHARE and TACIS. PHARE (initially Poland, Hungary-EU Assistance for the Reforms of the
Economies) now assists 11 CEE countries in the development of regulatory frameworks for the
environment, pollution monitoring and assessment, and installation of corrective action and
abatement strategies for priority pollution concerns.
<p>The TACIS (Technical Assistance for the CIS
Countries) programme helps CIS countries to move away from centrally planned to market
economies and to strengthen their democratic societies. Environment ranks among the priority
sectors of this programme (EC, 1994).

<p>In addition to the broad-brush processes, a large
number of policies and programmes are specifically targetted. Many focus on sectoral areas:
<UL>
<p><LI> The 1993 Helsinki Ministerial
Conference on forests gave a common political commitment that the increasing demands on
European forests for multiple goods and services should be met in a manner consistent with their
sustainable management and conservation and appropriate enhancement of their biodiversity.
<p><LI> At the Sofia Ministerial Conference,
the environment ministers of 55 countries endorsed the Pan-European Biological and Landscape
Diversity Strategy. This proactive strategy aims to stop and reverse the degradation of biological
and landscape diversity values in Europe. It addresses all biological and landscape initiatives
under a common European approach and promotes the integration of biological and landscape
diversity considerations into policies for social and economic sectors. The strategy also reinforces
existing measures and identifies a number of additional actions to be taken over the next two
decades. It also promotes a consistent approach and common objectives for national and regional
action to implement the Convention on Biological Diversity.
<p><LI> In the field of environmental health,
the World Health Organization's European Office (WHO/EURO) convened a Ministerial
Conference on Health and the Environment in 1994 that resulted in a Declaration and the
development of National Environment Health Action Plans. Under this process, a Committee on
Environment and Health was set up under the auspices of WHO to foster a co-ordinated European
approach in this area.

<h2>Regional Agreements for Air Quality: Some Impacts of
the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution</H2>

Within the framework of the 1979 Convention on Long-Range
Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), Parties to the 1985 Helsinki
Protocol undertook to reduce sulphur emissions by the end of 1993
to at least 30 per cent below 1980 levels. Under the 1988 Sofia
Protocol, Parties were obliged to stabilize nitrogen oxide (NOx)
emissions at 1987 levels (1978 levels for the United States) by
the end of 1994.
<P>
A major review carried out in 1994 showed that countries
have used a range of national policy measures to try and achieve
these targets:
<ul>
<LI><I>Regulatory Provisions</I>-standards
for fuel and ambient air quality; emission and deposition standards;
licensing of potentially polluting activities; etc.
<P>
<LI><I>Economic Instruments</I>-emissions and
product charges and taxes; user charges; emissions trading; subsidies
and other forms of financial assistance; etc.
<P>
<LI><I>Measures Related to Emission Control Technologies</I>-legislative
requirements to use &quot;best available technologies&quot;; wide
availability of unleaded fuel; etc.
<P>
<LI><I>Monitoring and Assessment of Air Pollution Effects</I>-monitoring
of air quality and environmental effects; research into effects
and assessment of critical loads and levels.
</ul>
<b>What Has Been Achieved?</b>
<P>
By 1993, all 21 Parties had reached the sulphur
reduction targets of the Helsinki Protocol. Together, they had
reduced 1980 sulphur emissions by 48 per cent.
<P>
By 1993, 18 of the 25 Parties had reached the NOx
emissions target of the Sofia Protocol; 4 Parties had emissions
4-41 per cent above the 1987 levels; and 3 Parties had not submitted
data. Total NOx emissions by the 25 Parties were down
4 per cent on 1987 levels. Increases in urban traffic make it
very difficult for countries to meet targets.
<P>
<b>What Has Happened to Air Quality?</b>
<P>
In general, concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO2)
have improved but NO2 concentrations and related health
problems in urban areas have not been significantly reduced.
<ul>
<LI>Belgium reports major reductions in urban SO2
concentrations and, since 1985, stabilization of SO2
levels in ambient air. There has been no significant reduction
in NO2 levels and short-term health guidelines are not
met.
<P>
<LI>Bulgaria reports that 40 per cent of the population
live in areas where sulphur and nitrogen emissions still lead
to harmful effects.
<P>
<LI>Finland reports significant reductions in sulphur
depositions from domestic sources.
<P>
<LI>Germany reports that mean annual SO2 concentrations
have decreased considerably in conurbations. In rural areas, SO2
concentrations have nearly halved whereas NO2 concentrations
have remained stable.
<P>
<LI>The Netherlands reports that acidifying depositions
decreased by about 60 per cent between the early 1980s and early
1990s.
<P>
<LI>Norway reports that sulphur concentrations in air
and precipitation decreased by 30-40 per cent since 1979, but
critical loads are still exceeded in more than 30 per cent of
the country. Nitrate concentrations in the lakes of southern Norway
almost doubled between 1974 and 1986, and the high levels have
since been maintained.

<p>Other initiatives are specifically designed to tackle
environmental problems affecting a defined geographical area. Many of the seas, including the
Aral, Baltic, Black, and Mediterranean, and some major river basins,
including the Danube and Rhine, have such programmes or action plans. The
&quot;Green Lungs of Europe&quot; is another collaborative effort involving seven countries
(Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and the Ukraine). It is designed to create
sustainable development zones through integrated ecosystem and economic management.
<p>There are a range of regional and subregional
agreements that relate specifically to the environment (See ) and form a common basis
for policy setting. Some agreements focus on sectoral issues; others, on geographical areas; and a
few focus on both. Where commitments have been implemented by countries and sufficient time
has elapsed for the agreement to have had an impact, results have demonstrated the beneficial
role of multilateral policy options approaches. (See <a href="#b3.14">Box 3.14.</a>)
<p>In addition to Government-level initiatives,
numerous international organizations and institutions provide vital support for the environmental
movement and for NGOs in the region, as well as providing funds for nature protection,
environmental education, and research.
