The GEO process has found both striking similarities
and marked differences among regional environmental priorities
today.	Environmental risks to human health are high on the priority
list in North America and transboundary regional environmental
problems and issues associated with unsustainable consumption
and production patterns are major concerns in Europe. Of more
immediate concern to Africa, and the less developed areas of West
Asia and Asia and the Pacific, are food security and the diminution
of poverty.
<P>
Regions with emerging market economies, such as those
of Eastern Europe, SouthEast Asia, and parts of Latin America,
increasingly face problems associated with rising energy demands
and other negative effects of industrialization, such as increasing
levels of pollutants and greenhouse gases. This trend will pose
serious problems of acidification, transboundary pollution, reduced
air quality, and declining health unless lessons of prior industrialization
are heeded. Problems of burgeoning populations, rapidly increasing
urbanization, and the widening gap between the rich and the poor
are concerns shared by most regions.
<P>
Poverty and the growing global population are often
targetted as responsible for much of the degradation of the world's
resources. However, the inefficient use of resources (including
those of others), waste generation, pollution and contamination
from industry, and high levels of consumption are equally driving
the earth toward an environmental precipice. Unfortunately,  environmental
problems are often disregarded when they interfere with shortterm
economic impetus; they only attract thoughtful attention when
economies are in jeopardy from the very environmental problems
economic advancement may bring. The intergovernmental process
is also too often slow in catching up with current conditions,
and there is an increasing need to encourage greater environmental
citizenship and informed voluntary action at all levels in societies.
<P>
In all regions it appears that politics
and environment are increasingly inseparable. Widespread access
to the media and modern communications in democratic societies,
with the associated availability of environmental information
empower individuals and interest groups to stimulate public policy
response. Political changes sweeping through much of
the developing and rapidly industrializing worlds suggest further
dissemination of these technologies with accompanying transparency,
access to information, and accountability.
<P>
Widespread poverty, the burden of increasing population without
accompanying development, urbanization, and equity questions still
menace sustainable development while acceptance is growing world-wide
of the need to seek solutions together on a global scale. And,
even though less developed regions have become involved increasingly
in international environmental negotiations, survival strategies
addressing the immediate needs of the poor often dictate short-term
actions. As a result, immediate needs are often met through, for
example, uncontrolled expansion of cultivation in wilderness areas
and inadequate land management to support food production.
<P>
Even when technologies are available, economic pressures tend
to slow change in industrial and industrializing countries, retarding
the introduction of cleaner and more efficient production methods
and reduced consumption. Unfortunately, in most regions there
is only embryonic acceptance and application of preventive and
remedial actions that-if taken sooner rather than later-would
assist sustainable development in all regions.<P><p>
