Environmental deterioration in Africa is intricately
Most national initiatives for the
environment in LAC revolve around command-and-control mechanisms,
particularly legislation. The major instruments in the legislative framework are new and improved
environmental institutions, such as ministries to co-ordinate environmental management and
enforce laws; the inclusion of environmental matters in the constitution; the setting of
environmental standards and norms through legislation; the use of economic instruments; and
increased public participation and education.
<a name="eninst"><p></a><b>Environmental Institutions</b>
<p>The creation of specific ministries of
the environment in many countries and the adaptation and empowerment of existing bodies have
been important steps towards the conservation of environmental quality in the region. The
establishment of appropriately empowered Government agencies helps ensure that environmental
issues become part of a Government's agenda and decision-making process. Moreover, the
establishment of these institutions will help pave the way for a more holistic and coherent approach
to environment and development issues and minimize the problems that arise from fragmented
and unco-ordinated institutional regimes (UNEP, 1995b).
<p>The new generation of state agencies responsible
for the environment in the region include: the Ministry of Sustainable Development and
Environment in Bolivia; the Secretariat of Environment, Natural Resources, and Fisheries
(SEMARNAP) in Mexico; the Natural Resources Conservation Department of Jamaica; the
National Environmental Commissions (CONAMAs) in Chile and Guatemala; the Secretariat of
Natural Resources and Human Environment (SERNAH) in Argentina; and the Secretariats of the
Environment in El Salvador and Honduras (UNEP, 1995b; WRI, 1995). Similar initiatives have
taken place in many other countries of the region.
<p>Most of these
institutions have multiple roles, ranging from the drafting of legislation to the enforcing of pollution
standards. For example, in Honduras, the General Law on the Environment in 1993 established a
State Secretariat in the Department of the Environment. The duties of the Secretariat are
monitoring compliance with and enforcing environmental legislation, formulating and co-ordinating
national policies on the environment, supervising their fulfilment, and co-ordinating public and
private institutions dealing with the environment (UNEP, 1995b). Through bodies of this type,
numerous legislative measures have been taken to set air and water quality standards, emission
standards, and impact assessment guidelines.
<p> Aside from the multi-purpose
environmental ministries, some countries have created separate bodies to deal with specific
environmental sectors. Examples include the protection of natural patrimony through specific
organizations, such as the National Commission for Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity
(CONABIO) in Mexico and the National Biodiversity Institute (INBIO) in Costa Rica-two
organizations devoted to the survey of the biological richness of their respective national
ecosystems. The work of these groups is pointing out gaps in the national networks of protected
areas and allowing the incorporation of knowledge derived from research in the areas into specific
policies (WRI/UNEP/IUCN, 1995).
<p>There has also been concrete progress in the
establishment of national systems of protected areas. In some countries, alliances have been
made with local populations, research groups, NGOs, and international organizations in order to
improve the management of protected areas and to implement the protection of reserves legally
decreed but not yet managed in practice.
<p>Environmental laws in the region have invested
relevant agencies with wide regulatory powers to establish environmental standards and norms. In
Mexico, power is given &quot;to establish requirements, conditions, procedures, parameters, and
permissible limits that must be observed in development of activities or use and benefit of products
which cause, or might cause, ecological imbalance or damage to the environment.&quot; Similarly,
the Brazilian Law on the National Environment Policy of 1981 entrusts the National Environment
Council with the task of setting standards and norms (UNEP, 1995b).
<p>The law enforcement powers granted to these
institutions reflect the seriousness with which particular states view problems within their borders.
In LAC, broad powers have been granted to pollution control authorities in some countries in an
attempt to control polluting activities.
<p>In Mexico, SEMARNAP has authority to confiscate
polluting materials or substances and impose the temporary closure of a polluting source where
there is an imminent risk to the environment or public health. The sanctions that may be imposed
by State or local authorities include fines, temporary or permanent closure of the offending source,
administrative arrest for up to 24 hours, and the cancellation of any permits, licences, or
concessions (UNEP, 1995b).
<p>In Honduras, it is not the environmental agency but
the courts that have the authority to impose fines or jail terms or to close down or suspend
activities or facilities that are damaging the environment. The courts may require indemnity to the
State or to third parties for damages caused to the environment or natural resources (UNEP,
1995b).
<p>
<a name="enamd"><b>Env</a>ironmental Amendments to Constitutions</b>
<p>
Since the 1972 Conference on the
Human Environment in Stockholm, principles of environmental management have increasingly
been incorporated into the constitutions of LAC countries. This elevation of environmental
concerns to constitutional status is a statement of intent, and may enhance the priority conferred
by Governments to sound national environmental management and sustainable development.
<p>All constitutions enacted in LAC in the two decades
since Stockholm contain important environmental protection principles, and older constitutions
have been amended to incorporate them. For example, the Constitution of Panama states that it is
the fundamental duty of the State to safeguard the conservation of ecological conditions by
preventing environmental pollution and imbalances in the ecosystems, in harmony with economic
and social development (UNEP, 1995b). Since UNCED, six LAC countries (Paraguay,
Cuba, Ecuador, Argentina, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua) have incorporated the right to a healthy
environment as a constitutional right. Bolivia and Chile incorporated this right into their general
environmental laws. Colombia has put the concept of sustainable development into its new
Constitutional Charter. In Mexico, the National Commission on Human Rights has
urged Government authorities to take action to solve critical environmental problems that are
considered to be violating the basic right to a healthy environment.
<a name="env"><p></a><b>Environmental Legislation</b>
<p>Legislation dealing with a broad range
of environmental issues-pollution, management of hazardous wastes, protection of water
resources, and conservation of biodiversity-have increased over the past decade in the region.
Effective implementation of the legislation and law enforcement, however, are still weak in
most countries, mostly as a result of the lack of financial resources.
<p>Environmental laws existed in the region before the
Stockholm Conference. Most were in the form of legislation dealing with the management and
sustainable use of specific natural resources such as fisheries. In 1967, for example, Argentina
established a legal system for control of fisheries, while  laws passed in the same year in Brazil
established penalties for marine pollution and regulated fisheries. In Colombia, several regulations
were passed as part of the National Code on Renewable Resources and Environmental Protection,
including decrees on hydrobiological resources (1978) and the use of marine resources (1979). In
Peru, a Forestry and Wildlife Law and a General Fisheries Law were enacted in 1975.
<p>Following the Stockholm Conference, appreciation
of the interrelationships within the ecosystem and the linkages in environmental stresses increased
greatly. Since then, there has been a growing realization that a combination of sectoral
&quot;resource-oriented&quot; legislation and anti-pollution laws are not sufficient to safeguard the
quality of the environment or to guarantee sustainable development. As a result, more
&quot;system-oriented&quot; legislation has emerged, aimed at the integrated planning and
management of the environment. This legislation began to emerge in Latin America with the
promulgation of the Colombian Code of Renewable Natural Resources and Environment
Protection in 1974, and with the Venezuelan Organic Law on Environment in 1976.
<p>The
new basic environmental laws of LAC countries are now the primary
instruments for reordering the fragmented and unco-ordinated sectoral approaches to
environmental management used thus far. These laws conceptualize the environment as an
integrated system that should be managed on the basis of all-embracing environmental principles,
policies, and plans. Such laws have been passed in most countries in the region.
<p>Examples include the 1986 Law for the Prevention
and Control of Environmental Pollution Decree in Ecuador; the Mexican General Law on Ecological
Balance and Environment Protection of 1988, which was added to the 1971 Law to Prevent and
Control Environmental Pollution; and the 1986 Guatemalan Law for Environmental Protection and
Improvement (UNEP, 1995b).
<p>The move towards more comprehensive
environmental laws is apparent in the increase in National Environmental Action Plans. The
countries that now have these include El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua in Central America,
and Colombia and Ecuador in South America. Numerous countries also have National
Conservation Strategies, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Nicaragua in Central
America, and Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru in South America. Many countries have augmented
these national plans with sectoral action plans, such as those for forests. (See <a href="../tab/tab3_2.htm">Table
3.2.</a>)
<p>Many
innovations have taken place as a result of legislative changes, particularly after UNCED, including
increased setting of emission standards and greater use of environmental impact assessments. As
a result, atmospheric degradation in some of the region's large cities is now not increasing quite so
fast. But there have also been numerous counteracting forces. On the one hand, introduction of
emission standards and programmes, such as Brazil's efforts to produce energy from biomass,
have contributed significantly to the reduction of gasoline emissions and achieved some degree of
sustainability in the use of energy. On the other hand, the widespread promotion of the automobile
industry in the region as a stimulus for industrial development has generated growing
environmental problems in the large cities.
<p>Environmental auditing of industries and
comprehensive environmental impact statements are now mandatory in many countries.
Environmental impact statements have become prerequisites for large-scale development projects
in some nations. Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are a predominant tool for
incorporating environmental considerations into national socio-economic planning. Many countries,
such as Chile, apply EIA legislation to both private and public-sector undertakings. In Mexico, the
Secretariat of Environment, Natural Resources, and Fisheries is responsible for reviewing
environmental impact statements, which must be prepared for specified projects and undertakings.
The Secretariat may grant authorization to undertake the work, deny permission, or require
modifications in order to avoid or lessen the severity of the environmental impacts associated with
ordinary operations (UNEP, 1995b). The EIA process in Jamaica lets the Natural Resources
Conservation Authority request an EIA of any permit applicant or anyone planning to undertake
works in prescribed areas (UNEP, 1995b).
<a name="ecfin"><p></a><b>Economic and Financial Instruments</b>
<p>The use of economic disincentives to
control and prevent pollution has long been part of national legislation in the region. The use of
pollution licences and fines for the improper treatment of waste are common examples of such
instruments. More innovative economic instruments are also being used in the region to address
environmental concerns. These include tax incentives, environment  funds, and other tools to
promote the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle.
<p>The Chilean Law on General Basis for the
Environment, in 1994, provided for an Environment Protection Fund. This is financed by
allocations from the national budget, among other sources, to provide financing for projects and
activities to protect or restore the environment, to preserve nature, or to conserve the
environmental heritage (UNEP, 1995b).
<p>Numerous countries work with schemes to promote
the polluter pays principle. For example, the Jamaican Government requires permits and licences
to undertake certain activities that will have a negative impact on the environment. Similarly,
Chilean environmental legislation encourages the adoption of economic instruments, including
tradeable emissions permits, tradeable water rights, emissions taxes or user charges, and other
instruments that encourage environmental improvement and restoration activities (UNEP, 1995b).
In Santiago, access rights to certain key city roads for buses and taxis have been auctioned. Costa
Rica introduced biodiversity prospecting rights and tradeable reforestation tax credits, and is
currently experimenting with internationally tradeable development rights and carbon offsets.
<p>Financial incentive programmes for the protection of
the environment also abound in the region. In Honduras, agricultural credits are given to
programmes and schemes that protect and conserve valuable soil resources. Investment in filters
or other technical equipment used for the prevention of pollution in the industrial, agricultural,
forest, or other commercial sectors may be deducted from income tax, and such equipment is also
exempt from import duties and sales tax (UNEP, 1995b).
<p>Some countries, including Mexico, Costa Rica,
Colombia, and Chile, have incorporated estimates of the degradation and loss of their natural
resources into their national accounting systems. For methodological reasons, these estimates
usually are not incorporated into the financial estimates of economic development. The fact that
indicators such as soil erosion or deforestation are presented together with financial estimates of
economic growth highlights the growing interest in the region in evaluating the costs of natural
resource degradation. (See <a href="ch3_21.htm#b3.16">Box 3.16.</a>)
<a name="publ"><p></a><b>Public Participation and Education</b>
<p> Non-governmental organizations
increasingly participate in the formulation of policies, and some Governments are turning over the
management of protected natural areas to NGOs and grassroots groups. Mexico, Colombia, and
Chile have passed new laws requiring Governments to establish environmental planning
committees with broad social representation at the provincial or local levels (WRI, 1995).
<p>The work of NGOs has been crucial in the creation
and management of protected areas in Costa Rica, of biosphere reserves in Mexico, and of the
Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve in Brazil. In some countries, NGOs have also been important
driving forces in the implementation of recycling programmes and in the promotion of alternative
sources of energy.
<p>One such example is the Isiboro Secure National
Park in El Beni, Bolivia. Most of the park's territory is located in territory traditionally occupied by
Indian communities who, after negotiations with the Government, began administering the park in
1992. In other countries, such as Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, and Costa Rica,
Governments have turned to NGOs to help manage national parks and other protected areas.
The Calakmul Bioreserve in Mexico's south-eastern state of Campeche is one example of
such NGO participation (WRI, 1995).
<p>Environmental education programmes are growing
at all levels in the region, and the incorporation of an environmental perspective into traditional
educational curricula is widespread in the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education.
Many LAC universities now offer graduate courses in environmental sciences, ecology, and natural
resource management.
<a name="eninf"><p></a><b>Environmental Information</b>
<p>A great deal of data and information
exists in the LAC region on the state of the environment and natural resources. Most countries
have completed either national State of the Environment reports or environmental profiles in some
form. (See <a href="../tab/tab3_2.htm">Table 3.2.</a>) These reports generally include an inventory of natural resources, a
summary of the state of the environment, and, in some cases, policies and strategies for natural
resource use and conservation. Most countries in the region provided national reports for UNCED
in 1992. However, few regularly or periodically publish State of the Environment reports, with the
exception of Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela. As a result, there is a lack of continuity and cohesion in
environmental monitoring and reporting. Much of the information produced is consequently
underused and does not adequately contribute to	 environmental decision-making and policy
setting in the region (CIAT/UNEP, 1995).
