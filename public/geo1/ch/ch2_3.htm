<P>
Africa is a large continent with many different dynamics.
Since the 1960s, it has experienced persistent and severe economic
and environmental problems, as well as political and social turmoil
in some countries. Its population growth rate-the world's highest - has
placed additional strains on all systems. Poverty has perpetuated
underdevelopment and mismanagement of resources in the region.
Furthermore, deterioration in the terms of trade and lack of financial
resources for investment have made it difficult for several countries
to develop patterns of livelihood that would reduce pressure on
the natural resource base.
<P>
However, this is only a part of African reality. Other significant
changes have also occurred, including the dramatic demise of apartheid
in South Africa, the end of civil wars and the subsequent accession
of elected Governments to power in Angola and Mozambique, implementation
of structural adjustment programmes in 35 countries that have
successfully put in place economic reform measures, a surge towards
political liberalization, and emergence of an increasingly strengthened
civil society (UNDP, 1996). These are examples of social and political
transitions towards peace and economic progress, although their
impacts on the environment are yet to be assessed. Africa is at
a critical turning point.
<P>
Amid these changes, environmental degradation continues. One of
the major problems common to the countries of Africa relates to
the great imbalance in the use of its natural resources: those
such as soil and vegetation are overexploited, while water, energy,
minerals, and organic resources are underused or exported raw.
Striking a balance between economic development and sustainability
for the growing number of people remains the major environment
and development challenge. The two are interlinked, requiring
a coherent and integrated regional approach for their solution.
The difficulty of finding the right path is compounded by the
region's great variance in cultural heritage and natural resource
endowments.
<P>
Various regional fora of African Government leaders have consistently
mentioned the following priority environmental concerns (UNECA,
1992, 1993a, 1993c; OAU, 1995; UNEP, 1996a):
<P>
<UL>
<LI>land degradation and desertification
problems, particularly in relation to the need for food security
and self-sufficiency;
<LI>the protection and sustainable use of forests;
<LI>effective management and protection of biodiversity;
<LI>water resources issues, including the problem of water
scarcity and efficient water management;
<LI>pollution problems, particularly those affecting freshwater
resources as well as urban, coastal, and marine areas;
<LI>climatic problems, including drought and climate change;
and
<LI>demographic change and population pressures on natural
resources and in urban areas.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="lan"></A><B>Land</B>
<P>
This continent contains the world's largest expanse
of drylands, covering roughly 2 billion hectares of the continent
or 65 per cent of Africa's total land area (UNEP, 1991a). One
third of this area is hyper-arid deserts, while the remaining
two thirds consists of arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas-home
to about 400 million Africans, two thirds of the continent's total.
Recurrent droughts are a permanent fact of life throughout the
drylands of Africa. Severe droughts have seriously affected both
agriculture and wildlife and caused deaths and severe malnutrition.
With each drought cycle, desertification increases. Currently,
36 countries in Africa are affected by drought and some degree
of desertification (UNEP, 1994). The risk of drought is high in
the Sudano-Sahelian belt and in southern Africa.
<P>
Land degradation, which includes degradation of vegetation cover
and soil degradation, has been identified as a major problem in
Africa. The extent of the problem continent-wide is difficult
to determine precisely due to lack of data, particularly on vegetation
cover degradation. The Global Assessment of Soil Degradation (UNEP/ISRIC,
1990; UNEP, 1991c) estimated that about a half-billion hectares
in Africa are moderately to severely degraded, corresponding to
one third of all cropland and permanent pasture on the continent.
Some national reports, especially in northern Africa, indicate
much higher percentages of degradation.
<P>
<A NAME="fig2_1a">
<A NAME="fig2_1b">
<A NAME="fig2_1c">
<A NAME="fig2_1d">
The main causes of the soil degradation are
overgrazing, particularly in drylands; extensive clearing of vegetation
for agriculture; deforestation; extensive cultivation of marginal
lands;	the use of inappropriate agricultural technology; poor
management of arable lands; and droughts (UNECA, 1992; Thomas
</A>and Middleton, 1993; Ohlsson, 1995). (See also Figure 2.1<A HREF="../fig/fig2_1a.htm"> a</A>, <A HREF="../fig/fig2_1b.htm"> b</A>, <A HREF="../fig/fig2_1c.htm"> c</A>, and <A HREF="../fig/fig2_1d.htm"> d</A>.) Other
contributors, particularly in the southern African countries,
are thought to include land shortages, usually due to the unequal
distribution of land, and the modernization of agriculture that
has led to marginalization of subsistence farming (Dahlberg, 1994).
All these activities lead to depletion of soil fertility, water
and wind erosion, and salinization (UNEP/ISRIC, 1990;
Thomas and Middleton, 1993).
<P>
Land degradation is exacerbating the existing natural constraints
on agricultural production, including poor soil quality, variable
climatic conditions, and reliance on rainfed agriculture. About
90 per cent of African soils are deficient in phosphorus, a key
nutrient in the production of biomass. These soils also have low
content of organic matter, and low water infiltration and retention
capacity due to surface crusting. Moreover, about half the cultivable
land (or three quarters of land already cultivated) is under arid
and semi-arid conditions, so potential for irrigation is limited
(World Bank, 1995).
<P>
Agriculture is the fundamental economic activity in most African
countries, averaging 20-30 per cent of gross domestic product
(GDP) in sub-Saharan Africa, and 55 per cent of the total value
of exports (excluding the oil-producing countries). Yet land degradation,
coupled with rapid population growth, is increasing deficits in
food production and food insecurity. Although a serious information
gap exists regarding the productivity impacts of degradation,
rough estimates indicate that, on average, land areas affected
by degradation have lost about 20 per cent of their productivity
during the last decade (World Bank, 1995).
<P>
<A NAME="for"></A><B>Forests</B>
<P>
The 1990 Forest Resources Assessment by the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization estimated the extent of forests
and other wooded land in Africa as about 1.14 billion hectares
(approximately 38 per cent of total land area) some of which is
in drylands.
<P>
The total area of tropical forests in Africa in 1990 was estimated
to be approximately 530 million hectares, compared with 569 million
hectares in 1980 (the average annual rate of deforestation was
<A NAME="fig2_2"></A>0.7 per cent). (See <A HREF="../fig/fig2_2.htm"> Figure 2.2.</A>) Africa's rainforests covered
about 7 per cent of the land surface in 1992, representing slightly
less than 20 per cent of the total remaining global rainforests.
The forests of Africa are the most depleted of all the tropical
regions, with only 30 per cent or so of the historical stands
still remaining (UNEP, 1994).
<P>
Africa's closed canopy tropical moist forests range from the mangroves
of Senegal on the west coast to the montane forests of Jevel Hantara
near the eastern tip of Somalia. Most of the countries of western
Africa were once clothed in forest from the coast to deep inland.
Central Africa still contains vast and more or less continuous
stretches of rainforest. Around 80 per cent of the rainforest
on the continent is concentrated in this area, particularly in
Zaire (see also Box 2.1, on the Congo Basin). Moving to the south
of the continent, the main forest block gives way to dense miombo
woodlands with scattered patches of dry deciduous type forest.
In eastern Africa, the moist forest gradually disappears as the
climate becomes more arid. In these areas, forests occur only
in strips bordering rivers, along the tops or slopes of mountains,
or on the wet coastal hills.

<H2>Some Areas of Rich Biodiversity and Forests in Africa</H2>
<B>Western Africa</B>
<P>
The relic blocks of forests left at Gola in Sierra
Leone, at Sapo in Liberia, and at Tai in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire are
now of global importance as the last significant remains of the
structurally complex and species-rich forests of the upper Guinea
zone (UNEP, 1994). Some areas-such as Fouta Djallon, Mount Nimba,
and Loma at the head of major watersheds in western Africa (the
Niger, Senegal, and Gambia rivers)-encompass areas of exceptional
biodiversity. These remaining centres of biodiversity are at risk
(World Bank, 1995).
<P>
<B>The Congo Basin</B>
<P>
This area constitutes the second largest contiguous
primary tropical rainforest area in the world. It has the lowest
population density in Africa but the highest level of urbanization
(52 per cent). One of the main economic activities is forest exploitation;
others include mining, gas and oil exploration, and related industrial
activities. Although the environment problems of the subregion
are less severe compared with others on the continent, a future
development challenge is to maintain the primary forest intact
while drawing benefits from its local use (World Bank, 1995).
<P>
<B>Islands of the Indian Ocean</B>
<P>
The biodiversity of some of the island countries
of the Indian Ocean are of global significance. The diversity
of the landscapes in Madagascar and the extremely high level of
endemism of its flora and fauna have put this country on the list
of environmental priorities in the world (World Bank, 1995). Most
of these species are found in the remaining forest areas.
<P>
It has been estimated that there were originally
about 11.2 million hectares of eastern rainforest, which was reduced
to 7.6 million hectares by 1950 and to 3.8 million hectares by
1985. The main causes of the deforestation are slash-and-burn
(or tavy) agriculture and cutting of fuelwood to sustain the growing
population. The population is still rural, surviving by subsistence
agriculture (WCMC, 1992). Madagascar and parts of southern Africa
were the home of the giant ostrich, or elephant bird, a huge,
3-metre-tall flightless creature whose 11 known species have long
been extinct. The mummified bodies and gigantic eggs of this bird
have been found in the Madagascar swamps. Their demise was probably
caused by human activities (UNEP, 1994).
<P>
Other endemic species of the Indian Ocean islands
include the red colobus monkey, found only on Zanzibar Island,
and the different species of fruit bats or &quot;flying foxes&quot;
found in the forests of Seychelles and Mafia and on the Pemba
Islands of Tanzania.

The total area of temperate forests in 1990 was approximately
13 million hectares, compared with 14.3 million hectares in 1980,
indicating an average annual rate of decrease of 0.9 per cent
(FAO, 1995). This was the highest rate of temperate-forest decline
of all developing regions.
<P>
Deforestation is a major problem
throughout Africa, although its causes and magnitude vary by region.
The major cause is related to forest clearance for agriculture
(particularly commercial farming and to some extent shifting cultivation)
and the harvesting of fuelwood (SARDC, 1994a; UNECA, 1992). In
1980, one study estimated that cultivation accounted for 70 per
cent of the deforestation (WCMC, 1992). In sub-Saharan Africa,
70 per cent of total energy consumed and 90 per cent of household
energy are derived from wood fuel, and it has been estimated that
in Africa each family uses at least 7 metric tons of wood a year
(SADC ELMS, 1993).
<P>
An extensive shortage of fuelwood is already particularly apparent
in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, including in Burkina Faso, Chad,
The Gambia, and Niger (World Bank, 1995). Commercial logging is
limited, but settlement and agriculture around roads built to
transport timber has resulted in additional clearing of forest
areas (World Bank, 1995). In northern Africa, deforestation is
particularly severe in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia (World Bank,
1994). What remains of the forests in humid West Africa are disappearing
at the alarming rate of about 2 per cent a year, and exceeding
5 per cent in the extreme case of C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire (World Bank,
1995). In eastern Africa, severe encroachment and  exploitation
are destroying the forests that occur in fragmented patches (UNEP,
1994). Additional causes of deforestation in southern Africa include
clearing of land for refugee camps, construction materials, tobacco
curing, and tsetse fly controls (SARDC, 1994b; Babu and Hassan,
1995).
<P>
<A NAME="bio"></A><B>Biodiversity</B>
<P>
Africa offers a wide spectrum of habitats and ecosystems.
Biological diversity varies in complex ways, depending on local
moisture regimes, topography, vegetation, and soil type. Countries
such as Zaire, which has large areas of land in the humid tropics,
and South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania-with impressively variable
landscapes-are famous for their high species diversity and impressive
wildlife populations. Some island States in the Indian Ocean are
rich in endemic species (UNEP, 1994).
<P>
Savannahs (consisting of savannah woodland, tree savannah, shrub
savannah, and grass savannah) are the most extensive ecosystem
in Africa and provide a home for the majority of humans, livestock,
and wildlife. They are the richest grassland regions in the world,
with a high incidence of indigenous plants and animals and the
world's greatest concentration of large mammals, particularly
in northern Tanzania (WCMC, 1992).
<P>
Several African mountains and highlands have unique and rich biodiversity,
with a number of endemic animal and plant species. These areas
include mountain ranges or chains such as the Atlas, Rwenzori,
and Aberdare mountains; more uniform volcanic cones
such as Mount Kenya, Mount Kilimanjaro, and Mount Cameroon; valleys
and escarpments such as the Rift Valley and the Nile gorge; and
highlands and plateaus such as those found in Ethiopia, Kenya,
and southern Africa. Particularly in the tropical and subtropical
regions of Africa, the sloping areas surrounding high altitudes
are of great importance for development (UNEP, 1994).
<P>
Wetlands cover about 1 per cent of Africa's total surface area
and are found in every country (WCMC, 1992). The largest include
the Zaire swamps, the Sudd in the Upper Nile, the Lake Victoria
and Chad basins, the Okavango Delta, and the floodplains and deltas
of the Niger and Zambezi rivers. The diversity of flora and fauna
of wetlands in Africa is immense and in many places unknown, with
endemic and rare plant species and wildlife, including migratory
bird species (UNEP, 1994). Many wetlands are under threat from
conversion (drainage and filling), overuse, pollution from farm
runoff and untreated urban and industrial effluents, and unplanned
development. Also, the fact that freshwater fish are a primary
source of protein and income in many local communities can threaten
biodiversity. Furthermore, a substantial number of species in
water masses are threatened with extinction from new species that
were introduced in the absence of environmental impact assessments
(WCMC, 1992), as happened in Lake Victoria (Roest, 1992).
<P>
The African coastal region is vast,
and includes a variety of habitats. Diversity of fish species
is high, with more than 4,000 species reported. Some of the most
numerous and economically most important fish species are tuna,
marlin, and billfish; tuna is a significant source of foreign
exchange for a number of countries.
<P>
Various kinds of human activities are harming biodiversity
in terms of habitat loss and degradation, resulting in, for example,
loss of medicinal and aromatic plants of high value. Cultivation
is perhaps the most significant cause of damage to ecosystems,
involving large land areas and alteration of the landscape. The
savannah was also greatly enlarged (usually at the cost of forests)
through burning to improve grazing for livestock and to facilitate
wild game hunting, forest clearance, and massive increases in
the number of cattle (WCMC, 1992).
<P>
The margins of the seas are affected by humans almost everywhere.
Habitats are being lost forever to the construction of harbours
and industrial installations, the development of tourist facilities
and mariculture, and the growth of settlements and cities. Increasing
coastal erosion as well as pollution is also evident.
<P>
The adverse effects of poverty on biological resources are compounded
by exploitation by a small but influential and affluent segment
of the African population and by commercial firms hastening to
satisfy market demands that often originate in other regions (UNEP,
1994).
<P>
African countries have taken steps over the years to
conserve their biodiversity in its various forms. Protected areas
have been established, for example, although they do not cover
the full spectrum of biodiversity in the major ecosystems. The
continent has 727 protected terrestrial areas (approximately 5
per cent of the total land area) and 112 protected marine areas
(WRI/UNEP/ UNDP/WB, 1996).
<P>
A few countries (in particular, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and South Africa)
have used one aspect of biodiversity-wildlife-for tourism development.
Africa's share of international tourism was only 2 per cent in
1990 (World Bank, 1995), but it is a growing economic activity:
for example, in southern Africa the number of tourists doubled
between 1990 and 1994, and tourism contributed to about 3.4 per
cent of the region's economy in 1994 (Hulme, 1996).
<P>
Although Africa's biodiversity generates considerable revenue,
both for Governments and businesses as well as for industrial
countries' commercial interests, more equitable distribution of
these revenues to landowners adjacent to protected areas is needed
to ensure the full and effective participation of local populations
in the tasks of conservation and sustainable use of
biological resources (UNDP/FAO, 1980; Makombe, 1993).
<P>
<A NAME="wat"></A><B>Water</B>
<P>
The availability of water in Africa is highly variable
both in space and in time. Precipitation over the continent varies
from practically zero over the Horn of Africa and the Namibian
Desert to more than 4,000 millimetres a year in the western equatorial
region. A large proportion of the continent is semi-arid, receiving
between 200 and 800 millimetres a year of variable rainfall. Droughts
that last between one and five years occur frequently.
<P>
The rainfall records from the early 1900s to mid-1980s
show that the continent's average annual rainfall has decreased
since 1968, and has been fluctuating around a notably lower mean
<A NAME="fig2_3"></A>level (UNEP, 1985). (See <A HREF="../fig/fig2_3.htm"> Figure 2.3.</A>) The impact of variable rainfall
and drought has been accentuated by land degradation and deforestation,
which have led to more soil erosion and hence increased sediment
transport-which adversely affects water quality, aquatic ecology,
reservoir volumes, estuaries, ports, and hydroelectric dams (World
Bank, 1996).
<P>
In Africa some 4 trillion (4,000 billion) cubic metres of renewable
water is available annually, but only about 4 per cent is used
<A NAME="tab2_1"></A>(WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB, 1996). (See <A HREF="../tab/tab2_1.htm"> Table 2.1.</A>) The infrastructure
and technical and financial means do not exist to use effectively
the water available (UNEP, 1996b). Runoff is concentrated in limited
upland areas (such as Fouta Djallon in Guinea, the Jos Plateau
in Nigeria, the Cameroon Mountains, the Ethiopian Highlands, the
Aberdares and the slopes of Mount Kenya, and Mount Kilimanjaro
and Lesotho and Swaziland Highlands), and relatively few lengthy
rivers run through downstream dry terrain (for example, into Sudan
and Egypt for the Nile River). The fresh water available to downstream
countries, often with a dry climate, depends on actions taken
by upstream countries to develop their own water resources (World
Bank, 1996).
<P>
The continent's ground-water resources, although widespread, are
limited. In sub-Saharan Africa, about 15 per cent of the renewable
water resources is ground water and more than three quarters of
the population uses this as their main source of supply (World
Bank, 1996). There are a few large sedimentary basins in the region
with substantial renewable ground-water reserves and numerous
smaller sedimentary aquifers along the major rivers, coastal deltas,
and plains.
<P>
Ground-water quality is deteriorating in some areas due to lack
of proper assessment and management, which leads, for example,
to overexploitation (World Bank, 1996). This is particularly true
in northern Africa.
<P>
The proportion of people without access to adequate
water is greater here than anywhere else: Africa has 19 of the
25 countries in the world with the highest percentage of populations
without access to safe drinking water (WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB, 1996).
West and central Africa have more than enough water on a per capita
basis, but in most other areas, population growth and economic
development create excess demand over supply.
<P>
For example, Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia suffer water
scarcity and stress (Population Action International, 1994). In
Libya, more than 100 per cent of the renewable water supply is
already being consumed, and fossil water is also being tapped.
The freshwater supply is particularly limited in the Sudano-Sahelian
<A NAME="fig2_4"></A>belt and parts of southern Africa. (See also <A HREF="../fig/fig2_4.htm"> Figure 2.4.</A>)
<P>
All the countries in continental sub-Saharan Africa share one
or more river basins. There are at least 54 rivers or water bodies
cross or form international boundaries in the region. However,
few are effectively managed jointly. The Nile, Zambezi, Volta,
and Niger rivers and Lake Victoria all have the potential to create
serious conflicts as well as cooperation and economic integration.
<P>
The various activities competing to use fresh water include individual
consumption, agriculture, fisheries, industry, power supply, livestock,
wildlife resources and recreation, and watershed protection. The
competition is becoming more intense, increasing the potential
for conflicts at local,	 national, and regional levels (World
Bank, 1996). The most important issue for Africa is to increase
investment and cooperation among riparian States to manage the
freshwater resources in an efficient and sustainable manner (UNEP,
1996b).
<P>
Rapid population growth, urbanization, industrialization, and
the drive for food security are putting pressures on water resources,
both in terms of quantity and quality. Domestic wastewater, industrial
effluents, and agrochemicals are polluting both freshwater and
coastal resources, causing health hazards, eutrophication, and
stress on aquatic and marine ecosystems. For example, diarrhoeal
deaths from consumption of contaminated water in Africa are the
highest in the world, and other water-related diseases such as
schistosomiasis, malaria, onchocerciasis, and filariasis are also
common (World Bank, 1996).
<P>
<A NAME="mar"></A><B>Marine and Coastal Environments</B>
<P>
The African coastline is vast and traces a variety of
habitats-from open ocean, near-shore waters, and sandy and rocky
islands to beaches, lagoons, sand dunes, mud and sand flats, rocky
cliffs, sea grass beds, coral reefs, and mangroves. Some of the
waters surrounding Africa, particularly those from the Straits
of Gibraltar to Guinea, are among the richest fishing grounds
in the world, and the marine areas from Angola south to the Cape
also contain great wealth (UNEP, 1985). Fish species diversity
is high, including some of the most numerous and economically
important fish. For many countries, especially in western Africa,
fish is the main source of protein; Nigeria consumes the continent's
largest quantities of fish (UNEP, 1994). The east coast of Africa,
with the possible exception of Somalia, is not as fortunate; there
the resources range from moderate to poor (UNEP, 1985).
<P>
Fishing and tourism are the main forms of marine resource use
in Africa. Tourism is having an increasing impact, for example,
in North Africa [Centre for Environment and Development for the
Arab Region and Europe (CEDARE), personal communication, 1996].
Exploitation of mangrove forests is also an important economic
and subsistence activity in many countries (SARDC, 1994c), and
the cutting of these forests causes serious threats to the habitat.
Dynamite fishing, the most environmentally destructive fishing
method, is used along the coast. Although it is illegal in many
countries, the laws are not actively enforced (UNEP, 1996b).
<P>
Several eastern African countries are constructing dams for hydroelectric
power (UNEP, 1990) and in western Africa nearly all the main rivers
have been dammed in at least one location (UNEP, 1989), blocking
sediments and nutrients as well as fresh water. Excessive erosion
of river mouths and delta areas (often the site of mangrove forests)
and recession of shorelines and even disappearance of islands
and towns (such as the town of Keta on the western coast) have
occurred because of a reduced supply of sediment. The reduction
in sediment and nutrient supply also affects the spawning and
growth cycles of marine fish and prawn species as well as fisheries
further offshore (UNEP, 1990).
<P>
The decrease in freshwater discharge in the estuarine areas alters
the extent of salt-water intrusion, with significant effects on
the coastal ecosystems. For example, the mangrove swamps and rain-
forests of the Niger Delta have been damaged by salt-water intrusion
(UNEP, 1990). The possible impact of sea level rise is also a
high concern in the coastal and island countries of Africa (UNEP,
1996b).
<P>
Marine and coastal pollution problems do exist in Africa, although
the scale of industrial activities is relatively limited and the
size of population in relation to the length of coastline is also
relatively small compared with other regions (UNEP, 1989 and 1990).
<A NAME="fig2_5"></A>(See <A HREF="../fig/fig2_5.htm"> Figure 2.5.</A>) The Mediterranean Sea, however, is one of the
most polluted water bodies (CEDARE, personal communications, 1996).
In Africa, little sewage is treated, and effluents from growing
industries are discharged into city sewage systems, rivers, and
the coastal environment (including the sea, estuaries, and lagoons)
mainly untreated and unchecked.
<P>
Pollution has many impacts on major coastal systems, such as the
Niger Delta, where aquatic life and habitats are damaged (World
Bank, 1996). In eastern Africa-for example, in Madagascar-soil
erosion and consequent siltation as well as agrochemical pollution
are increasing as a result of the development of irrigation, rice
cultivation, and expanded and intensified agriculture into marginal,
often sloping, areas (UNEP, 1990). In countries such as Mozambique
and Tanzania, expanded, relocated, and new settlements in coastal
areas and river plains, as well as overexploitation of mangroves
for timber and fuelwood, are also increasing soil erosion problems
and habitat loss for aquatic species, including shrimp and
prawns (the largest contributor to the Mozambique's foreign exchange)
(UNEP, 1990; Dalal-Clayton, 1995; Dejene and Olivares, 1991).
<P>
 A number of other development activities are leading to major
changes in coastal areas. The growth of towns and seaports and
the dredging of harbours are some examples. Most coastal countries
of western Africa have exploitable oil reserves. The main exploitation
takes place in the area between Nigeria and Gabon. The cases of
oil spillage in Nigeria have caused some significant local problems
(UNEP, 1990). Environmental impacts from oil production, transportation,
and related industrialization is also a concern in some North
African countries, particularly Egypt, Libya, and Algeria (CEDARE,
personal communication, 1996). In addition, the Iraq-Kuwait conflict
had negative environmental impacts (UNEP, 1991b).

<A NAME="urb"></A><B>Urban and Industrial Environments</B>
<P>
Urbanization is increasing rapidly in Africa. With only
35 per cent of its population living in cities, Africa is the
least urbanized continent in the world. Yet the urban population
soared from 83 million in 1970 to 206 million in 1990 (Morna,
1996), and the number of cities with more than a million inhabitants
increased from only one 30 years ago to 18 by 1990 (World Bank,
1995). Lagos in Nigeria and Cairo in Egypt are the world's fifteenth
and eighteenth largest cities, with average annual population
growth rates in 1990-95 of 5.68 and 2.24, respectively (WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB,
1996). In the least developed countries, urban growth rates are
among the highest in the world, at nearly 5 per cent a year. Between
1990 and 1995, some of these countries, including Burkina Faso
and Mozambique, registered urban growth rates of more than 7 per
cent a year (WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB, 1996).
<P>
The main causes of urbanization are rapid
population growth, natural disasters, ethnic tensions, and armed
conflict. With 7 million refugees and 17 million internally displaced
people, Africa has the highest number of people in the world forced
to leave their homes (Morna, 1996). Additional reasons for rural-urban
migration, which are generally true for developing countries,
include the prospect of jobs and higher incomes in urban areas,
poverty and lack of land in rural areas, and declining returns
from agricultural commodities. (See also the discussion of social
causes of environmental deterioration later in this section.)
<P>
Most African cities have not been able to develop the basic environmental
services (such as solid waste disposal systems, sewage treatment,
and adequate industrial and vehicle pollution control) to keep
pace with the rapid growth of new urban dwellers. This has led
to a steady deterioration of the urban environment,
with a particularly strong impact on poorer people. For instance,
urban health hazards resulting from a lack of clean water and
proper sanitation particularly affect the poor. Reliable data
are lacking on the scale and intensity of urban poverty in Africa.
Although the incidence of rural poverty is still significantly
higher, it seems that the difference is narrowing (WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB,
1996).
<P>
Much of the urban population growth is in coastal cities. In North
Africa, for example, the coastal zones along the Mediterranean
are the most inhabited areas (Serhal <I>et al</I>., 1994).
The rapid growth of coastal cities is one of the most
pressing environmental concerns in the subregion (CEDARE, personal
communication, 1996). Coastal zones bring all the pressing environmental
issues together in one place-those related to agriculture,
fisheries, water management at the interface between marine and
river systems, infrastructure, and urban and industrial development.
Most Governments, even in industrialized countries, do not have
robust institutional mechanisms to deal with such complex systems
in an integrated manner (World Bank, 1995).
<P>
Air pollution levels in the region are still low, but are emerging
as a problem at local levels, particularly in major cities. In
most countries and cities, pollution is neither monitored nor
controlled. There is virtually no long-term study of pollutant
impacts at the local or regional level. The primary sources of
air pollution are coal and biomass burning, mining and manufacturing
industries, and vehicles. Household burning of fuelwood, charcoal,
and coal creates indoor pollution and local health hazards, and
the burning of grasslands and forests also contributes to particulates
and elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The harmful
effects of pollution are exacerbated by poor nutrition. Air pollution
is emerging as a major problem in South Africa and to some extent
in Zimbabwe, in areas where energy use and industrial development
are essentially based on mineral coal (SARDC, 1994a; Ohlsson,
1995; Dalal-Clayton, 1995).
