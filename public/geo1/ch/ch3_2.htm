<h2>Current Changes in Approaches to Environmental  Policy</h2>
<h3>Changing Environmental Policy Perceptions and Concepts</h3>
Many parts of the industrial
world achieved economic growth and wealth in the past by having
unlimited access to environmental resources (air, water, land,
soils, and so on), and little thought was given to the impacts
of growth on the environment. They then sought to improve and
protect their quality of life from the environmental impacts of
their development-initially from the effects of pollution on air
and water, and more recently from hazardous waste, biodiversity
loss, ozone layer destruction, and global climate change.
This protection was largely achieved through Government-regulated
command-and-control policies and end-of-pipe solutions that relied
on legislation and measures such as emission standards and limits
and on maximum permitted rates of resource use.
<P>
Significant improvements in environmental
protection have been made in many parts of the world through such
strategies and action (see below). Yet the state of the ecosphere
as a whole continues to deteriorate. Developments in the different
regions (<a href="Ch2_0.htm">Chapter 2</a>) and explorations of the future (<a href="Ch4_0.htm">Chapter 4</a>)
show that an increasing number of environmental constraints will
be encountered in the next few decades. Although command-and-control
standards are effective in many cases in terms of short-term environmental
improvements, the costs of implementation, enforcement, and compliance
are high and may hinder long-term economic development. Furthermore,
although such policies have proved to be efficient for pollution
control, they are less effective for problems associated with
the management, protection, and conservation of natural resources,
particularly when a large number of different groups and people
use these resources. Environmental issues have developed from
simple (local, attributable, quantifiable, easy-to-solve, low-risk,
and with short time horizons) to complex (global, non-attributable,
non-quantifiable, difficult-to-solve, high-risk, and with long
time frames). Complex environmental problems demand a combination
of policy instruments to achieve environmental goals without constraining
economic growth, development, and human well-being. Effective
policy setting in support of sustainable development indeed requires
a more diverse mix of policies that address the social fabric
of life, ensure effective institutional arrangements, improve
the economy in all its sectors, protect the environment, and
so on. Consequently, countries are complementing command-and-control
policies with, among other things, market-based economic
instruments, methods to achieve cleaner and more resource-efficient
production systems, and efforts to change consumer attitudes.
<P>
Economic instruments are increasingly applied world-wide. They
aim at changing behaviour by offering incentives rather than by
imposing standards or regulating specific technical improvements.
Many of them seek to internalize external costs (both resource
depletion and pollution costs), so that the producers,
transporters, and consumers of various commodities face the full
social costs of their activities (the &quot;polluter pays&quot;
principle-PPP). A simple example is a carbon tax applied to motor
fuel: this makes the producer pay the full social costs of depletion
of the resource and makes the consumer absorb the full social
costs of environmental damage, thus creating incentives to use
fuel and vehicles more efficiently.
<P>
Few, if any, economic incentives have actually replaced regulations
because most have been introduced with the primary objective of
increasing Government revenues rather than altering behaviour
towards more environmentally friendly activities. Also, some examples
are available whereby economic instruments have been used &quot;for
short-term economic gains,&quot; which resulted in degradation
of the environment. The issue at hand is how to get the best out
of market forces, while at the same time moving towards environmental
protection and equitable opportunity, and how to determine the
appropriate level and type of regulation by Government to achieve
this. In countries with strong institutional frameworks, it appears
to be mostly a question of fine-tuning existing policies. For
countries with weak and transforming institutions, it will entail
an extensive and lengthy process of capacity building at all levels.
<P>
As detailed in the following sections, the trend is definitely
toward using economic instruments to modify behaviour in a positive
way. A summary of different groups of economic instruments is
given in <a href="#b3.2">Box 3.2.</a>. In  <a href="#b3.3">Box 3.3</a>, positive experiences with economic
instruments are described briefly.

<P>
In this context, clear interest in environmental
impact assessments (EIA) has also developed. An EIA is
the analysis of the likely environmental consequences of a proposed
human  activity. Although generally project-specific, EIAs have
increasingly been applied to policies, plans, and programmes as
well (UNEP, 1996d). The principle objective is to ensure that
environmental considerations are incorporated into the planning
for, decisions on, and implementation of development activities.
EIAs increasingly assist in preventing or minimizing an activity's
adverse impacts, while maximizing its beneficial effects.
<P>
Experience demonstrates that an effective EIA depends on three
fundamental mechanisms: public participation (effectiveness is
determined largely by how successfully the community has been
involved), inter-sectoral co-ordination, and a consideration of
alternatives. Through these mechanisms, EIAs serve an increasingly
integrative and preventive role in development policy and planning.
<P>
A perceptional change is also manifested
in structural adjustment programmes that are being implemented
in developing countries. A combination of long-standing domestic
policy distortion and the adverse external conditions of the 1970s
(such as oil shocks, debt crisis, and world recession) created
severe macro-economic and structural problems for developing countries.
In response, stabilization and structural adjustment programmes
were implemented. Structural adjustment policies predated the
concept of sustainable development and focused on the objective
of development assistance and economy-wide policies. They have
now evolved to realign with the concept of sustainable development
through integration with social and environmental policies.
<P>
A 1996 UNEP study explored the question of the environmental
effects of stabilization and structural adjustment programmes
(UNEP, 1996a). Understandably, the answer depended on a large
number of interrelated factors, implying that economic policy-makers
cannot apply a simple, standardized set of reforms to any given
economy and expect predictable, consistent, or even beneficial
results. Macro-economic reforms may even have unpredictable and
mixed effects, depending on the situation in a country, or threaten
economic growth and environmental integrity for the
future in certain cases.

<H2>Experience with Economic Instruments</H2>

A recent survey showed that 14 members of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development used between 1 and 20
economic instruments for environmental protection. Germany, Sweden,
and the Netherlands were the most progressive in this respect.
Of the 151 instruments in use, approximately half were charges
and one third were subsidies. Others were such instruments as
deposit-refund systems, market creation, and enforcement incentives.
<P>
In the developing world, there is considerable
emphasis on communal management systems. Property rights can play
a particularly important role in conservation and biodiversity
protection. It all relates to the conversion of non-domesticated
land to other uses, such as agriculture or industry, as detailed
in Chapter 4. Transferring the responsibility of resource management
to local communities and allowing them a fair share of the benefits
arising from economic activities associated with non-cultivated
biological resources helps reduce the pressure to convert such
areas.
<P>
An example of retention of customary rights over land
is found in Papua New Guinea, where more than 90 per cent of the
land remains communal. In contrast with other developing countries,
only 13 per cent of the forestland in Papua New Guinea has been
converted to other uses.
<P>
Other economic instruments are also widely used. Private
water rights in India provide incentives for the efficient management
of an increasingly scarce resource. Concession bidding, forest
fees, timber taxes, and environment bonds are used throughout
West and Central Africa to promote sustainable management. China
has introduced industrial discharge permits and emission charges
that double or even triple if the allowable discharge standard
is exceeded. Turkey has found relocation incentives to be effective
for urban-based industry, while Chile has introduced both tradeable
emission permits and tradeable water rights. Puerto Rico uses
transferable development rights to promote coastal conservation.
Costa Rica introduced biodiversity prospecting rights and tradeable
reforestation tax credits, and is currently experimenting with
internationally tradeable development rights and carbon offsets.
Kenya has introduced differential pricing for entry into National
Parks to combat congestion in the most popular eco-tourism destinations.
<P>
 Removal of timber from forests is being controlled
in several countries by tradeable extraction permits, as, for
example, in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire.
<P>
In offshore fisheries, for example, several countries
are using tradeable quotas when conventional property rights cannot
be assigned but an aggregate catch quota can be set, monitored,
and enforced. Similar approaches are being used to optimize the
numbers of visitors to national parks in Africa (through tradeable
visitor permits), the numbers of hotels built in tourist development
areas (through tradeable development permits), and the use of
irrigation water (through tradeable water shares). Some economies
in transition are experimenting with tradeable emission permits.
<P>
Urban pollution and congestion are being controlled
by restricting the number of certain vehicles with access to urban
areas. In New York City, for example, the number of taxis is controlled
with tradeable licenses. In Santiago, Chile, the right of access
to certain key city roads for buses and taxis has been auctioned.
<P>
Charge systems have typically been applied to the
protection of resources from waste discharges and emissions. In
Malaysia, for instance, effluent charges have been in operation
for 20 years to protect water quality from effluents arising from
the palm oil and rubber industries. In Singapore, a scheme that
charged drivers for using roads in the city centre during peak
hours resulted in a 73-per-cent reduction in traffic in the restricted
zone (and less carbon monoxide). Virtually all the economies in
transition have introduced pollution charges.
<p>
Throughout the developing world, traditional
societies maintain a wealth of customary use rights and communal
management systems that provide incentives for the efficient use
and conservation of natural resources. Although many have come
under intense pressure from population growth, from new markets,
and from technology, these systems contain valuable lessons and
experiences for the design of effective, modern resource management
systems that are attuned to local customs.
