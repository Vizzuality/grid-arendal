<h2>Summary of Regional Policy Responses</h2>
<h3>Basic Policy Instruments</h3>
Most countries in the different regions have established
command-and-control policies as logical steps in the pursuit of
better environmental management. The tools for implementing
these policies are primarily legislation, compliance monitoring,
and litigation. However, the effectiveness of implementation depends
on the presence of appropriate environmental agencies, the comprehensive
scope of legislation, availability of adequate human and financial
resources to monitor compliance, and an effective legal system.
As a consequence, environmental policy implementation varies greatly
between regions and nations.
<P>
In Asia and the Pacific, umbrella environmental legislation and
comprehensive environmental policies increasingly provide an overall
framework for regulating most forms of pollution and enhancing
environmental management in general. Specific command-and-control
policies are firmly in place. Implementation of umbrella policies
has unfortunately been hampered in a number of countries by institutional
weaknesses and a lack of human and financial resources.
<P>
Many African countries have also enacted umbrella legislation,
mainly within the framework of national environment action plans
(NEAPs) stimulated by international financial institutions and
conventions. Monitoring and regulatory systems have been set up
in several states in the region to implement the legal provisions
of new or revised environmental legislation. Unfortunately, institutional
weaknesses, lack of skilled manpower, and inadequate training
facilities still hamper monitoring and enforcement of environmental
policies and regulations in a large number of African countries.
Limited financial resources are partly to blame, but
lack of coordination between involved authorities and counterproductive
government policies also contribute in many instances to further
restraint of policy implementation.
<P>
In countries of the EU, environmental
legislation, and environmental considerations now impact on every
individual, sector of society and governance structure. North
America also relies strongly on legislative measures to combat
environmental deterioration. While economic reform offers the
key to solving certain environmental problems in countries of
Central and Eastern Europe, environmental legislation needs further
development, harmonization and	enforcement to achieve maximum
effectiveness.
<P>
In Latin America and the Caribbean most national initiatives concerning
the environment revolve around command-and-control mechanisms,
particularly legislation. While new institutions established to
deal with the environment greatly assist implementation of legislative
reforms throughout the Region, institutional weaknesses remain
and are often aggravated by limited finances. Structural
adjustment programmes have also led some governments to cut social
and environmental spending in this region, as well as in Africa,
causing the temporary abandonment of environmental planning in
a number of affected countries.
<P>
Environmental programmes, institutions, and laws in West Asia
have sometimes been created haphazardly and not in the context
of an over-arching strategic plan for the environment. This has
resulted in dominantly sectoral approaches to environmental planning
without due consideration of the need for cross-cutting policies
and institutional requirements. Recently, attempts to harmonize
environmental legislation and the role of institutions in developing
strategic frameworks for environmental planning have taken place
in a number of countries in West Asia.
<P>
Overall, in the developing regions compliance monitoring is still
constrained by a lack of financial resources and inadequate availability
of skilled manpower.
