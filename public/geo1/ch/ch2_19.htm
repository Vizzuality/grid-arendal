<A NAME="sci"></A><B>Science and Support Activities</B>
<P>
Scientific investigation is the predominant human activity
in this region that offers outstanding opportunities for fundamental
research essential to understanding the global environment. Since
regular scientific and support activities began, the number of
people visiting the Antarctic has increased steadily through to
1989-90 (Beltramino, 1993). Exact data on person-days spent in
the region are unavailable due to the way in which data are reported
but, for obvious reasons, most activity occurs during the summer
months. The United States has the largest Antarctic science programme.
The size and nature of the scientific presence in Antarctica,
coupled with more relaxed rules and practices of environmental
management in the past, have resulted in localized impacts on
the Antarctic environment. The effects of past activities, such
as open burning and dumping of trash close to stations, may still
be seen today, although the Madrid Protocol (see <A HREF="ch3_33.htm"> Chapter
3</A>) now bans these practices and calls for the cleanup of old dump
sites. Aircraft, vehicular and boat traffic, travel by foot, and
camp and station construction all inevitably still have some impacts,
even under the more stringent rules of the Madrid Protocol.
<P>
<A NAME="tou"></A><B>Tourism</B>
<P>
Antarctica has been a limited tourist destination for
the past 40 years; around 60,000 tourists are estimated to have
visited during that time (adapted from Enzenbacher, 1993). In
addition  to those arriving by sea and air, a number of tourists
see Antarctica only by air, without landing.
<P>
However, commercial tourism has undergone a period of accelerated
growth in the past 10 years. The number of tourists visiting Antarctica
in 1995-96 was the highest ever recorded. There have also been
associated increases in the number of vessels used to carry tourists
and in the number of sites they visit. At least 12 ships are now
in use for tourism each season (United Kingdom, 1995), and landing
sites have increased from 36 to more than 150 since the early
1990s (NSF, 1995; Ucha and Barrio, 1996).
<P>
The types of activities available to tourists have broadened to
include skiing, climbing, camping, and sea kayaking. Although
numbers are low, there is growing awareness of the importance
of environmental issues arising from tourism (Enzenbacher, 1994).
In response to the increase in tourism, the International Association
of Antarctica Tour Operators was founded in August 1991. Antarctic
Treaty Recommendation XVIII-1 (see <A HREF="ch3_33.htm"> Chapter
3</A>) provides operational
and environmental guidelines to tour operators in Antarctica.

<A NAME="exp"></A><B>Exploitation of Marine Living Resources</B>
<P>
<A NAME="tab2_15"></A>Exploitation of living marine resources in the Antarctic
is focused on krill (<I>E. superba</I>) and Antarctic
finfish species. Predominant target species are the Patagonian
toothfish (<I>Dissostichus eleginoides</I>), mackerel
icefish (<I>Champsocephalus gunnari</I>), and lanternfish
(<I>Electrona carlsbergi</I>). The finfish fisheries
have been active since 1969-70, with more than 3 million metric
tons caught prior to 1995-96, though finfish catches have been
very low since 1992. Krill harvesting began in 1972-73, and the
current catch, which is the largest in Antarctic waters, is around
90,000 metric tons a year (Kock, 1994). (See <A HREF="../tab/tab2_15.htm"> Table 2.15.</A>) Some
new fisheries are being initiated and investigated, such as harvesting
of stone crabs <I>(Lithodidae)</I> and squid (<I>Martialia
hyadesi</I>), which may have potential for commercial
exploitation (New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade,
1995; CCAMLR, 1996). Krill catches have declined since the early
1990s. However, this is primarily due to a reduction in the Russian
and Ukrainian fishing activities rather than to a decline in the
krill population (CCAMLR, 1993).
<P>
Total allowable catch limits have been set for targeted species
under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources (CCAMLR). Current fishing levels are well below these
limits, with the possible exception of the Patagonian toothfish,
for which illegal fishing is believed to equal or exceed the allowable
catch limit (ASOC, 1996). Many fisheries, including krill, are
still considered to be in the exploratory stage of exploitation.
Thus it is important to have accurate knowledge of the biology
and ecology of the entire marine ecosystem to allow for informed
management decisions leading to a sustainable fishery.
<P>
Most finfishing in the
Southern Ocean has been conducted with bottom trawls-funnel-shaped
nets towed behind a vessel (Kock, 1994). Trawl gear is reported
to affect the environment by scraping and ploughing the seabed,
resuspending sediments, and generally disturbing the benthos (seabed
environment) (Jones, in Kock, 1994). Exact effects on the rich
benthic flora and fauna of the Southern Ocean are largely unknown.
It is speculated, however, that trawling could have serious, long-lasting
impacts on the slow-growing, low-resilience benthic assemblages,
with consequent effects on food chains and sustainable fisheries.
<P>
Incidental mortality of seabirds during longline fishing operations
has been reported as a significant problem (Ashford and Croxall,
1994 and 1995). Mitigation measures, such as setting of longlines
only at night, have now been adopted under the CCAMLR.
<P>
A 1982 decision of the IWC imposed a moratorium on whaling (except
for indigenous subsistence and scientific purposes) from the 1985-86
season. The moratorium ended in 1994, the same year in which a
Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary was established by the IWC. There
is presently no known commercial hunting of seals in Antarctica.
