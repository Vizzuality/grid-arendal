<P>
Europe and the CIS have relatively stable populations.
Annual population growth rates are low, ranging from slightly
negative up to 1 per cent (World Bank, 1996). National populations
tend to be rather static, though a wave of migration, mainly east
to west, has occurred since the breakup of the centrally planned
economies (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
The region,
apart from the FSU, is relatively densely populated and highly
urbanized. With two thirds of Europeans in western and central
countries already living in urban areas, current urbanization
rates are low except in Turkey with around 4.5 per cent
urban growth per annum (WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB, 1996). Europe s urban
population lives on around 1 per cent of the total land area (EEA,
1995a). A European city of 1 million inhabitants typically consumes
about 11,500 metric tons of fossil fuels, 320,000 metric tons
of water, and 2,000 metric tons of food daily. It also produces
300,000 metric tons of wastewater and 1,600 metric tons of solid
waste plus 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Many of Europe s major concerns
are linked to the highly concentrated consumption of resources
and production of wastes of these densely populated areas, and
to the fact that per capita production and consumption rates are
among the highest in the world. For example, with less than a
quarter of the world s population, the region accounts for some
40 per cent of the world s energy consumption (EEA, 1995a). Excluding
the FSU, consumption of energy in Europe is greater than production;
Europe is therefore contributing to energy resource depletion
elsewhere in the world. The new democratic and open societies
in CEE are now establishing western-style consumption patterns.
In addition, the increasing number of households and the small
average household size (2.7 people) in Europe tend to exacerbate
this situation. Smaller households use water and energy less efficiently
and require more land per household member, which leads to greater
per-capita resource use (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
The enormous consumption of natural resources has now been recognized
as one of the root causes for the destabilization of the ecosphere.
Not only do the nature and magnitudes of inputs into human economies
determine all outputs (emissions, effluents, wastes, material
goods), but the very displacement of resources from natural settings
by technical means leads inevitably to ecological changes. Displacements
can be huge. In the former West Germany, for example, it has been
calculated that more than 530 million tons of construction materials
alone were moved from one location in the country to another during
1990 (Sch&uuml;tz and Bringezu, 1993). Therefore, precautionary
environmental policies must be very much concerned with resource
productivities on all levels.
<P>
The distribution of goods to meet demands is having a significant
and increasing impact on the environment, especially where motor
vehicles are the main form of transport (UN-ECE, 1995). Concerning
private transport, western Europe now has more cars than households
since the number of cars almost doubled between 1970 and 1990
(EEA, 1995a). In CEE, increasing private car ownership has overwhelmed
the existing transportation infrastructure. While new road networks
are now being built, the preservation and further development
of public transport systems that are already in place in many
cities could be better for the environment (REC, 1994).

<P>
There is an enormous dichotomy between the economies
of western Europe and the rest of the region. This is key to interpreting
economic root causes. Almost all of western Europe falls in the
high-income group of the most recent World Bank classification-their
gross national product (GNP) per capita was $8,956 or above in
1994 (World Bank, 1996). The countries of CEE and the FSU are
mainly in the lower-middle-income bracket (GNP per capita between
$725 and $2,895) (World Bank, 1996). Agriculture and heavy industry
predominate in these economies, in contrast to the manufacturing
and service industries in the west.
<P>
In 1994, GNP per capita-adjusted by the United Nations purchasing
power parity-ranged from less than $1,000 for Tajikistan to more
than $25,000 for Switzerland, with obvious implications for the
spending power and living standards of people (World Bank, 1996).
At present rates of economic growth, it has been estimated that
it will take countries like Hungary and Poland 20 more years to
reach the average 1994 income level of the EU countries (World
Bank, 1996).
<P>
Where wage-earners are well off, it is conceivable that they will
become increasingly willing to work fewer hours. In OECD Europe,
the average amount of time actually devoted to work has fallen
from some 3,000 hours per year a century ago to around 1,700 today
(OECD, 1994). Researchers foresee this trend continuing even in
countries with already relatively low average working hours. In
Norway, for instance, worktime per employee is projected to fall
from about 1,400 in 1991 to around 1,300 in 2010 (OECD, 1994).
<P>
Estimates of economic growth to 2002 suggest annual increases
in the range of 2.5-2.7 per cent for EU, 2.6 per cent for EFTA,
3.4 per cent for CEE, and 1.3-2.0 per cent for the FSU (EEA, 1995a).
More significant at the moment is the enormous difference between
the long-established, buoyant, prosperous economies of western
Europe and the economies in various stages of transition to the
east. The political reforms in CEE and the FSU in the late 1980s
and early 1990s have led to the replacement of centrally planned
economies by market-oriented systems. Rates and degrees of adjustment
have varied between countries, from the almost instantaneous changeover
in the former East Germany to more hesitant modification in many
FSU countries. The changes are all in a similar direction, however:
towards price and trade liberalization, privatization, demonopolization,
and the reform of tax, legal, and financial systems (World Bank,
1996).
<P>
These changes have had enormous
short-term repercussions. National output fell dramatically in
many transition countries. In CEE as a whole, for example, industrial
output fell by over 40 per cent from 1989 to 1992 (WHO, 1995).
At the same time, there was generally a sudden burst of inflation.
At the personal level, poverty has increased, living standards
have dropped, and inequality has reached levels similar to or
greater than those of many west European countries (World Bank,1996).
Some of the transition countries, like Poland and Hungary,
now appear to have passed through these stages. The Czech Republic,
Hungary, and Poland are, for example, now OECD members and the
Baltic countries, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic are considered
to be market economies. Output and productivity	 have begun to
increase again, and poverty rates have stabilized. Other countries,
especially in the FSU, are still experiencing declines in output
and high inflation.
<P>
Combined with individual sectors of the economy, these east-west
differences manifest themselves in varying ways as economic drivers.
The region is a major focus of industrial activity; it contains
around half the world s countries with the largest outputs of
industrial products, chemicals, machinery, and transport
equipment and processed food (WHO, 1995). In western Europe, efficiency
in energy and material use has improved substantially over the
past 20 years with the introduction of improved production processes.
The oil price rises of the 1970s provided a major incentive for
some of these changes.
<P>
In contrast, in CEE, which was
buffered from world energy prices until the late 1980s and then
went into several years of economic depression, similar efficiencies
have not yet been realized, although there have been marked improvements.
While the per capita consumption of energy in CEE is often lower
than the western European average, the relative consumption of
energy per unit of product is several times higher (World Bank,
1996) due to the preponderance of heavy industry and obsolete
technologies. Recent market reforms in transition economies have
been accompanied by the appearance of a great many small, aggressive
businesses in industrial, agricultural, and service sectors. These
new enterprises often lack experience in responsible environmental
management; landscapes have been marred and natural resources
abused in the process (REC, 1994 and 1995b).
<P>
Data for 1994 show the share of agriculture in national economies
to range from 1-3 per cent for most West European countries to
more than 50 per cent for Albania and Georgia (World Bank, 1996).
Although there are subregional variations, Europe is characterized
by high-input farming systems. Large increases in the use of nitrogenous
fertilizers and pesticides over recent decades have been major
factors in increasing food production in western Europe as well
as a major source of environmental contamination. In the eastern
part of the region, however, applications of agricultural chemicals
have dropped sharply during the economic depression of the last
five years and following the breakup of collective farms.
<P>
The passenger transport sector in the region grew by 3.1 per cent
a year between 1970 and 1990 (EEA, 1995a). Road transport for
both passengers and freight is expected to nearly double between
1990 and 2010 (EEA, 1995a). Air passenger transport is also undergoing
a rapid increase, although with the trend towards larger aircraft,
the number of aircraft movements has not increased as fast as
the number of passengers (EEA, 1995a).
<P>
Tourism and recreation have become important social and economic
activities in Europe. Sixty per cent of the global tourist traffic
is destined for Europe, with Japan and the United States being
the main source areas (EEA, 1995a).The current growth in European
tourism is expected to reach around 6 per cent per year by 2000,
by which time there are expected to be at least 380 million arrivals
per year in the region (EEA, 1995a). A large number of additional
tourists originate from within the region. Although tourism may
have adverse impacts on the environment in local areas, such as
the degradation of mountainous tracts in the Alps or the destruction
of habitats in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean, there are
also positive, albeit minor, spin-offs that may indirectly benefit
the environment, such as increased environmental awareness by
the general public (EEA, 1995a).
