<h2>Europe and CIS Countries</h2>
<h3>Regional Information Sharing</h3>
<p>The region has a clear policy towards
promoting access to and sharing of environmental information. At the Sofia Ministerial Conference,
the ministers adopted the UN-ECE Guidelines on	Access to Environmental Information and
Public Participation in Environmental Decision-Making and recommended that it should be
developed into a convention (UN-ECE, 1995). EU members have already been instructed to
implement Directive 90/313 on the freedom of access to environmental information, giving any
person anywhere in the world the right of access to any information on the environment held by
public authorities (Stichting Natuur en Milieu &amp; FIELD, 1994).
<p>International organizations have established
programmes to make environmental information more generally accessible through environmental
information networks in support of such policies. These include the European Information and
Observation Network of the European Environment Agency (EEA), UNEP's ENRIN programme,
OECD, and UN-ECE. All these activities extend into countries with economies in transition. UNEP
has set a priority in strengthening the information networks in the countries with economies in
transition, and EEA's CORINE inventories are being expanded to the PHARE countries.
<p>The EEA, established in 1993, implements a co-
ordinated approach to environmental information, monitoring, and assessment. In addition to
incorporating many of the integrated and sectoral monitoring and assessment programmes, the
activities of the agency are expected to improve the co-ordination of European and global data
systems, thereby strengthening the European partnership towards the solution of global problems
(EEA, 1995).
<p>UNEP is working with and through a number of
internationally supported, regionally based programmes to build or increase capacities for handling
environmental data and information. These include the GEF-funded Black Sea and Danube River
Basin Programme Co-ordination Units in, respectively, Istanbul and Vienna.
<p>NGOs and NGO networks play a vital role in
disseminating information to a wide range of users. Regional participatory networks, involving
national and international governmental organizations as well as NGOs, are also gaining strength.
One rather advanced example is the <a href="/ballerina">BALLERINA network</A> of the Baltic Sea countries, making use
of modern telecommunications technologies.

<h2>Some Guiding Principles Emerging from the European GEO Consultation</H2>
<UL>
<LI> A manageable and reliable method for tracking environmental
change and policy impacts is required. A well-chosen set of indicators
would be an ideal tool.
<P>
<LI> There is always a trade-off between environmental
needs and expectations and the economic reality of what can be
afforded. It is therefore essential to set priorities, using agreed
criteria. When it comes to alternative actions, it makes sense
to pick ones that will address several problems at the same time.
<P>
<LI> Once environmental problems are recognized, it takes
time to get them on to political and policy agendas, especially
where environment ministries are the weak cousins in Governments.
However, experience has shown that early action benefits not only
the environment but also the economy; policies put in place today
save money tomorrow.
<P>
<LI> Environmental problems are closely interlinked
and are an integral part of economic and social systems. Water
and coastal zone management are clear examples of socio-economic
situations that must be considered together with technical management
aspects. Every effort should be made to tackle environmental problems
in an integrated way, even though this is conceptually complex
and most attempts to date have been crude.
<P>
<LI> International cooperation is essential for tackling
transboundary environmental issues because these cannot be solved
by individual countries. Legal and institutional frameworks must
first be in place and multilateral agreements have an important
role to play. Progress in the European region is variable:
<ul>
<LI> Legal frameworks are generally in place for air
quality and hazardous waste disposal, but inadequate for the protection
of coastal areas.
<P>
<LI> Institutional frameworks need to be better developed
for some river basins.
<P>
<LI> Mechanisms to regulate land use on
an international level exist for the European Union; countries
w;ith economies in transition still need to
establish the necessary institutional and legal frameworks.
<P>
<LI> The protection of biodiversity is governed by
an unusually large number of international agreements; specific
bilateral and multilateral policies are still required to tackle
issues like biosafety, green corridors, and protected areas across
international borders.
<P>
<LI> An international framework on sound forestry practices
is needed; existing international agreements such as the Framework
Convention on Climate Change could be used as an additional protective
mechanism.
<P>
<LI> A full assessment of the impacts of the Chernobyl
accident is still needed and would assist the many countries in
the region still dealing with the aftermath of the event.
</ul>
<LI> Another set of issues, including many urban and
land degradation problems, require national or subnational policy
development and action; international collaboration is not necessary
in these situations.
<P>
<LI> Most successful policies in the region have been
driven by sectoral issues. However, with emphasis on end-of-pipe
remedial measures, policies have not always been effectively focused.
More emphasis is needed on the &quot;input&quot; side of equations
and achieving a comprehensive &quot;cradle-to-grave&quot; approach.
<P>
<LI> Many problems can now be anticipated far in advance.
Whereas many environmental problems of western Europe are linked
to life-styles, eastern European countries still have the opportunity
to choose their own consumption and production patterns, to evolve
a different route towards sustainable development and avoid the
mistakes made by the West.
<P>
<LI> Current pan-European processes are still weak on
linking issues to policy. Driving forces must be the action links
between the two.
</ul>
