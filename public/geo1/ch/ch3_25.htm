There is today a realization throughout the region that
an appropriate mix of instruments will achieve the best overall
environmental results. Voluntary compliance measures are increasingly
seen by nearly all stakeholders as important complements to regulatory
and economic instruments for environmental protection. The social
and economic benefits of improved environmental performance
and the desire to anticipate  regulations are driving corporations
to &quot;get ahead of legislation.&quot; Such voluntary actions
by the private sector also demonstrate to Governments and the
public that self-regulation is a viable option (EC, 1996a).
<P>
<A NAME="com"></A><b>Comprehensive Management</b>
<P>
Overall, a noticeable shift in North America is taking
place away from managing single resources towards managing ecosystems
composed of a variety of resources. In Canada, the State of the
Environment Report has long championed this concept. Environment
Canada is advancing an operational strategy with ecozones as spatial
reporting units, emphasizing that people are indeed part of the
ecosystem (Government of Canada, 1996).
<P>
In the United States, Federal agencies including the Forest Service,
Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, National
Park Service, and the EPA have established integrated ecosystem
management policies. These guide decisions for achieving various
goals, including those set by law. Nearly 150 U.S. examples
were identified by the Keystone Center's national policy dialogue
on ecosystem management. Such programmes seem to offer the most
promise where public and private lands have multiple uses, such
as forestry, fisheries, grazing, and recreation (PCSD, 1996).
<P>
EPA promotes watershed protection by a holistic
framework that addresses complex water quality problems. The strategy
is place-based, integrating water quality management activities
within hydrologically defined drainage basins (watersheds), rather
than in areas defined by political boundaries. There are several
key guiding principles for the watershed protection approach,
including a place-based focus, stakeholder involvement and partnerships,
environmental objectives, problem identification and prioritization,
and integrated actions (EPA, 1994b).
<P>
In both countries, these initiatives provide some of the best
examples of how to achieve sustainable development through a comprehensive
ecosystem approach. Key elements essential to its success are
partnerships, environmental citizenship, science, and leadership.
<P>
The region is also making progress in adopting market mechanisms
to improve comprehensive environmental management. In Canada,
a baseline study of possible barriers and disincentives was initiated
in the 1994 budget that provided for a Task Force on Economic
Instruments and Disincentives to Sound Environmental Practices.
The Government has since continued to work to substantially reduce
or eliminate many subsidies, grants, and contributions that may
inadvertently disadvantage environmental objectives with regard
to other goals. For example, business subsidies have been reduced
between 1994-95 and 1997-98 by about 60 per cent (Government of
Canada, 1996).
<P>
The U.S. Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 takes a comprehensive
approach towards industry-encouraging manufacturers to modify
equipment and processes, redesign products, substitute raw materials,
and make improvements in management techniques, training, and
inventory control (Gore, 1995). Incentives for continuous environmental
improvement are a major feature of the Industry Strategy Division
(ISD) created in 1995 by EPA. ISD works towards its goal in a
number of ways, including demonstration projects with companies
and other stakeholders in Louisiana, New Jersey, and Indiana that
focus on four industrial subsectors-metal finishing, chemical
manufacturing, photo imaging, and thermoset plastics.
<P>
<A NAME="cre"></A><b>Creative Partnerships</b>
<P>
The importance of partnerships, empowered communities,
and stewardship in environmental management is now widely recognized.
Significant popular mobilization has created an important network
of environmental organizations in civil society that have information,
advocacy, and watchdog roles. As EPA Administrator Carol
Browner noted, &quot;In the final analysis, what is critical in
our efforts to advance pollution prevention is a willingness to
take chances, to question established practices and to experiment
with new ideas and, above all, to cooperate with each other as
we try to harmonize environmental protection with economic growth&quot;
(EPA, 1994a). Of particular note in both the United States and
Canada has been the taking up by industry of voluntary initiatives
concerning environmental conservation and protection.
<P>
 In the United States, for example, EPA has many co-operative
programmes targetting specific constituencies. The Common Sense
Initiative, the Green Lights Program, and the Star Program are
perhaps its most visible efforts to create pollution-prevention
partnerships for environmental protection. (See Box <a href="ch3_24.htm#b3.18">3.18.</a>) There
are also initiatives to spur municipal solid waste reduction by
large businesses.
<P>
Environment Canada is also working to give
Canadians the tools to build a greener society. The Department
focuses on providing educational and information services, forming
partnerships and convenants between government and industry, and
ensuring that economic development is environmentally sensitive.
National environmental indicators, a system of key indicator bulletins,
and the award-winning Green Lane on the Internet are examples
of Environment Canada's commitment to engage Canadians
in becoming environmental citizens.
<P>
One of the most significant institutional changes in Canada in
the past year took place under the banner of the &quot;Federal
House in Order&quot; initiative. In 1996, the Federal Government
established the Office of the Commissioner for the Environment
and Sustainable Development. As a result, each Federal department
is required to develop sustainable development strategies, including
plans for the greening of their operations and policies, progress
on which is reported to the Parliament.
<P>
In Canada, experience is demonstrating that non-regulatory approaches
can achieve measurable environmental results. One particular example
is the Accelerated Reduction/Elimination of Toxics Initiative,
which is the cornerstone of Environment Canada's pollution
prevention efforts. The purpose of ARET is to reduce the potential
adverse effects of toxic substances on human health and the environment
by accelerating the reduction or elimination of emissions of selected
toxic substances. Since the ARET Challenge was launched in March
1994, 300 facilities from 170 major corporations have taken up
the cause. These organizations have filed action plans with toxic
release reduction commitments of more than 24,000 tons a yearby 2000. This reduction represents a 72-per-cent release reduction
overall from the base year, 1994.
<P>
Another very notable measure is the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)
Program pioneered in the United States. TRI takes information
that manufacturers are required to submit annually to EPA and
places it in the public domain. The overall goal of the programme
is to enhance the public's ability to monitor industry's releases
of contaminants and to serve as a pollution prevention scorecard
by tracking toxic chemicals. At the same time, TRI raises the
internal awareness of industry and creates strong public-image
pressures for companies to reduce wastes. Of the 23,321 facilities
that reported to TRI in 1993, 35 per cent implemented source reduction
activities (EPA, 1994b).
<P>
EPA is also working with stakeholders to design the next generation
of the voluntary 33/50 Program. More than 1,300 companies committed
themselves in this programme to reducing releases and transfers
of 17 high-priority toxic chemicals by 33 per cent in 1992 and
50 per cent in 1995, based on the 1988 TRI benchmark. The programme
is expected to include information on the extent to which source
reduction and other pollution prevention practices are responsible
for documented release reductions.
