<P>
<A NAME="lan"></A><B>Land Degradation in the Tundra</B>
<P>
The mainland of the Arctic is dominated by tundra with
taiga, or boreal forest, in the southern parts of the region.
Other major land cover types include alpine and high mountain
areas, broad-leaved forests in coastal areas and valleys, as well
as marshes and glaciers.
<P>
The tundra are the vast treeless plains of the Arctic. Due to
low temperatures, permafrost, low bacterial activity, and
almost complete lack of invertebrate soil fauna, biological material
is decomposed slowly in tundra areas. Nutrients are thus
not readily available for new plant growth. The result is low
production, slow plant growth, and slow revegetation where vegetation
has been damaged or removed (EEA/NPI, 1996).
<P>
The natural factor that most strongly determines the landscape
character in the far north is permafrost. Where there is continuous
permafrost, the ground is frozen up to a depth of 400 metres.
During the summer, melting only occurs to a depth of about 1 metre,
which creates a poorly drained often marshy landscape intersected
by dry ridges (EEA/NPI 1996).
<P>
The low production of the terrestrial ecosystems makes the Arctic
tundra particularly sensitive to land degradation and erosion.
Annual melting of the topsoil above the permafrost layer combined
with damage to the vegetation cover by human activities can lead
to erosion. This process is further  exacerbated by slow vegetation
regrowth. In northern Scandinavia, herding of reindeers has also
led to overgrazing and subsequent erosion. Sulphur dioxide emissions
from nickel smelters have also led to vegetation damage and subsequent
erosion, as, for example, on the western part of the Kola Peninsula
(Tommervik <I>et al.,</I> 1995).
<P>
<A NAME="for"></A><B>Forests</B>
<P>
The taiga is a zone of
coniferous forest encircling the northern hemisphere south of
the permafrost line. It represents an important commercial resource
in the Russian Federation, Finland, and Sweden. The plant and
animal species composition is relatively uniform throughout the
taiga. The taiga forest basically consists of one canopy layer
with an undervegetation of dwarf shrubs, mainly of the heather
family, crowberry, and mosses and lichens. Broad-leaved deciduous
forests are found in the areas of warmer and more oceanic climates.
A characteristic feature of the boreal zone is the formation of
peatlands (bogs), which develop in wet areas due to poor drainage
and incomplete decomposition of plant material. Iceland had large
forests before the arrival of the first settlers in the early
Middle Ages. Gradual but steady deforestation and extensive sheep
and horse herding have since practically cleared the entire island
of forests. In the Russian Federation, large-scale clear cutting
and plantation forest monoculture are environmental concerns.
Landscapes are altered, the local climate is affected, the natural
diversity of the forests is disrupted, and bogs and marshes are
often drained in the process of planting new forest stands. The
new stands are usually single species of uniform age (EEA/NPI,
1996).
<P>
<A NAME="bio"></A><B>Biodiversity</B>
<P>
A relatively small number of terrestrial species is
able to survive the strong climatic contrasts of the Arctic year,
characterized by long, cold, dark winters and short, light summers.
Only a few species live in the tundra areas through the winter.
Other species migrate into the region for the summer season only.
<P>
Arctic plants generally have reduced exposed leaf areas (needles
or small narrow leaves) or shed their leaves during winter to
increase survival when available moisture is very low. In the
High Arctic, most plants have developed low and creeping structures
more suitable for survival where cold, drying, and damaging winds
are prevalent. Bowl-shaped flowers and hairy stems are also common
because these features help to capture and retain heat from the
sun. In general, the plants have low growth rates, low
production capacities, inefficient sexual production, and simple
distribution mechanisms. Growth and production decreases from
south to north (EEA/NPI, 1996).
<P>
Animals face many of the same challenges for surviving in the
Arctic. Whether living permanently in the region or visiting for
parts of the year, the animals of the Arctic have special adaptations.
Both marine and terrestrial mammals have large body-volume-to-surface
ratios and store considerable amounts of fat (for example, as
in seals, whales, and polar bears). The mammals, as well as birds,
are quite mobile with some exceptions such as the Svalbard reindeer,
which are extremely sedentary. Many of the animals are long-lived,
reproducing often but having few young at a time. This increases
the chances of successful reproduction in a situation of high
mortality of the young (EEA/NPI, 1996).
<P>
Because of the harsh climatic conditions on land, the biodiversity
of the region is relatively poor. However, several interesting
and important species are endemic or strongly influence the terrestrial
ecosystems. These include, for example, the lemming and other
rodents, reindeer species, arctic fox, wolverine, wolf, lynx,
and brown and polar bears. Some of these species are endangered.
In addition, some of the world's largest populations of sea birds
are found in the Arctic.
<P>
Although listings of Arctic species may appear substantial, the
number of species in any given area is usually limited. The diversity
and complexity of food webs increase as arctic ecosystems grade
into more temperate ecosystems. Because of the relatively low
diversity, some food chains are short and simple. An example is
the lichen-caribou-wolf chain in Arctic Canada. This food chain
is of particular concern as a potential pathway of contaminants
because of the importance of caribou and reindeer as a traditional
food source for Northerners.
<P>
By comparison, the marine environment is far
more productive. The North Atlantic waters are among the most
productive areas of the world due to the inflow of warmer, nutrient-rich
water from the southern Atlantic, the influx of Arctic water bringing
nutrient-rich water from ice-covered areas, and considerable vertical
blending on the banks in the shallow waters (EEA/NPI, 1996). The
nutrient-rich water masses, together with 24-hour sunlight in
the summer, support a large production of biomass, such as algae,
that are consumed by higher trophic animals and eventually by
 top predators, including humans.
<P>
The region's marine ecosystems are characterized by large stocks
of a few key plankton, crustacean, and fish species as well as
sea birds and large sea mammals. Capelin, cod, and herring are
the largest fish stocks (EEA/NPI, 1996). High natural fluctuations
in fish stocks and other species are typical of the region. The
more stable benthic (sea bed) ecosystems are rich in species.
For example, the Barents Sea and adjacent areas contain 2,000
species of benthic animals, constituting 80-90 per cent of the
total number of marine animal species in the area (EEA/NPI, 1996).
<P>
Fishing, whaling, and other sea mammal hunting are well-known
examples of overexploitation of Arctic resources. Massive hunting
of the marine mammals started in the early 1600s. The bowhead
whale was practically driven to extinction between 1600 and 1700;
the blue whale, fin whale, humpback whale, and sei whale populations
were drastically reduced between the mid-1800s and 1920; and the
smaller minke whale has been exploited from the 1930s. Walrus
and harp and hooded seals were hunted from the early 1800s up
to the 1980s. By the 1900s, the survival of the popular
polar bear was dangerously threatened throughout the European
Arctic area. In the past three decades, overfishing and the decline
of certain fish stocks have led to conflicts among nations regarding
access and management of resources.
<P>
<A NAME="fig2_25"></A>All countries in the region have established protected areas.
As of 1995, there were 285 such areas. (See <A HREF="../fig/fig2_25.htm"> Figure 2.25.</A>) They
covered approximately 2.1 million square kilometres, or a little
over 14 per cent of the Arctic area (CAFF, 1996b). Some of the
first nature protection areas of the Arctic were established in
Sweden and Alaska in 1909. The largest protected area is the Northeast
Greenland National Park (972,000 square kilometres). This park,
which is mainly ice cap, makes up about half of the protected
area total. The majority of the protected areas cover terrestrial
ecosystems; the marine areas are poorly represented.
<P>
<A NAME="mar"></A><B>Marine and Ice Edge Ecosystems</B>
<P>
Ice edges and associated waters are key areas of productivity
in all regions of the Arctic (Smith and Sakshaug, 1990). Melting
ice causes an increase in the stability of the water column, which
allows phytoplankton to be retained (phytoplankton bloom) in a
defined active photosynthetic layer at the ice edge (Marshall,
1957). Contaminants that accumulate on the sea ice surface are
released to sea surface waters when the ice melts. Most melting
and subsequent particle/contaminant release occurs in the marginal
ice zone where biological activity is concentrated in surface
waters. Fauna associated with the ice edge form an important pathway
for contaminants to enter the food web between primary producers
and fish, sea birds, and mammals (Futsaeter <I>et al.</I>,
1991).
<P>
<A NAME="ozo"></A><B>Ozone Depletion</B>
<P>
Although the
ozone layer over the Arctic has been depleted recently, there
have been no &quot;holes in the ozone layer&quot; comparable to
those over the Antarctic region. In the spring of 1995, however,
stratospheric ozone concentrations over Europe were 10-12 per
cent lower than in the mid-1970s, and over North America, 5-10
per cent lower. From January to March 1995, the ozone layer was
reduced by as much as 35 per cent over Russian Siberia (SFT, 1996).
The Arctic winter in 1994-95 was exceptionally cold, and ozone
concentrations were 20-30 per cent below normal. The winter of
1995-96 was even colder. This unexpected recurrence of cold winter
temperatures may in itself be due to cumulative ozone destruction
or possibly climate change; in either case, ozone losses over
the northern hemisphere may be more severe than anticipated in
the near future.
<P>
The intensity of ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) has increased
accordingly; 1992-93 saw the first reported examples of persistentincreases over densely populated regions in the northern hemisphere,
posing a threat to primary plant and animal plankton productivity
and human health in terms of increased risk of skin cancer and
other health problems (UNEP, 1994).
<P>
<A NAME="che"></A><B>Chemical Pollution in the Arctic Region</B>
<P>
Measurements indicate that pollutants, such as persistent
organic pollutants (POPs), heavy metals, radionuclides, and acidifying
gases, are transported to the Arctic by the atmospheric, riverine,
and ocean pathways. The Commonwealth of Independent States countries,
Europe, North America, and Japan are the main sources for these
long-range transported pollutants. Trends in measurements of chemicals
such as DDT and toxaphene in the region indicate that developing
countries, where these chemicals are still in use, also contribute
to the presence of these pollutants in the Arctic region (Canadian
Dept. of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, personal communication,
1996).
<P>
 Although the concentration of many pollutants tends to be low
in the Arctic environment, there are notable exceptions. Elevated
concentrations of certain heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury
have been found in Arctic sea birds, fish, and marine mammals.
The levels of POPs are also high in Arctic species like
the polar bear, as well as in other marine mammals. Because fish
and marine mammals are a major food source for indigenous peoples
in the region, the toxic contaminants they contain pose a human
health risk (PAME, 1996).
<P>
Radioactive contamination is considered
one of the main threats to the Arctic environment in spite of
low current levels of contamination and sharp falls in caesium-137
levels in both the North and the Barents seas since the 1980s
(Strand and Cooke, 1995). The main sources of radioactivity are
the French La Hague and British Sellafield reprocessing plants
and global fallout from atmospheric tests in the 1950s and 1960s.
There are additional inputs and risks from Russia, including contamination
from the Chernobyl accident, earlier dumping of liquid and solid
radioactive waste, minor leakages from installation and dumping
sites, and improper storage and management of spent fuel from
both civil and military sources. Waste management is also an issue
in the Canadian north where, prior to land use regulations, waste
was abandoned with little concern for the environment. Military
installations, exploration camps, and mines were the main source
of these wastes (Canadian Dept. of Foreign Affairs and International
Trade, personal communication, 1996).
<P>
During the cold war, the Arctic Ocean represented one of the main
frontiers between the West and East. The ice-covered Arctic Ocean
was a superb area for hiding submarines with strategic nuclear
weapons. The Kola region in north-west Russia, the only ice-free
harbour to the Atlantic, still houses the largest concentration
of nuclear vessels and weapons in the world. After the
end of the cold war there was a lack of resources to manage these
installations. Radioactive materials were released accidentally
or through leakages from these installations as well as from plants
further south (Tomsk and Mayak), draining northwards. These, together
with solid waste dumped into shallow waters in the Kara Sea, all
represent threats to the Arctic environment, its people, and its
fisheries (EEA/NPI, 1996).
<P>
Onshore and offshore exploration of oil and gas, and their transportation
through pipelines and by ships, represent a risk to the region's
environment. The continued use of outdated technology in some
areas exacerbates this risk. The expected large onshore and offshore
oil reserves of Siberia are one key area for exploration both
by western and Russian companies (PAME, 1996; EPPR, 1996). The
<I>Exxon</I> <I>Valdez</I> accident in Alaska
and the oil spill in the Komi Republic of Russia are examples
of accidental damage caused by oil-related activities. Decomposition
of hydrocarbons is slower in the cold Arctic climate compared
with warmer areas. This provides extra time for released contaminants
to spread and extends the time that they can have an impact on
the environment.
<P>
<A NAME="arc"></A><B>Arctic Population</B>
<P>
The total human population in the Arctic currently exceeds
3.5 million. The indigenous population constitutes approximately
80 per cent of the total population in Greenland, 50 per cent
in Arctic Canada, 15 per cent in Alaska and Arctic Norway, and
a smaller proportion in the rest of the Arctic countries (AMAP,
1996). Due to improving living conditions through socio-economic
development, the population growth rates in many parts of the
Arctic are rising and the population is generally young (AMAP,
1996). At the same time, a number of northern regions in Russia
have lost 20-30 per cent of their population during the 1990s
due to emigration, a decreased birth rate, and increased mortality
(Goskomstat of Russia, 1995).
<P>
The indigenous peoples of the north
have traditionally survived on a sustainable system of hunting
and herding the local fauna. Today, many of the local inhabitants
are increasing the level of resource exploitation to supplement
their income and are involved in new and non-traditional activities,
such as industrial processing and tourist services. Purely traditional
life-styles are tending to disappear as indigenous people adopt
&quot;southern&quot; life-styles to a greater or lesser extent.
These are accompanied by changes in food and dwelling habits,
education, and health care.
<P>
Differences between the local and introduced cultures are levelling
out in some areas, most notably in the Nordic countries. In other
areas, however, such as in the Arctic regions of the Russian Federation,
there have been decreases or withdrawal of centralized subsidies
for traditional economies. These economic changes are imposing
hardships on the local populations and consequently on the environment
on which they depend for much of their livelihood. Overall, there
is a growing recognition of traditional values among the Arctic
peoples themselves, among national Governments, and among international
Arctic organizations. Increasingly, such values are being  addressed
in various programmes, including those operating under the Arctic
Environmental Protection Strategy.
