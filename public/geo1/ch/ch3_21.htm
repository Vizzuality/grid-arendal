<h3>Regional Initiatives</h3>
The last years have witnessed the
growth and strengthening of subregional agreements, initiatives, and alliances in LAC. While these
have mainly aimed at developing and promoting regional economic and social issues, they also
incorporate environmental and sustainability issues. Such agreements include the Andean Pact
(<I>Pacto Andino</I>), MERCOSUR, the Andean Corporation for Promotion of
Development (<I>Corporaci&oacute;n Andina de Fomento</I>), the System of Central
American Integration (<I>Sistema de la Integraci&oacute;n Centroamericana</I>), the
Initiative for the Americas (<I>Iniciativa para las Am&eacute;ricas</I>, which includes the
United States and Canada), and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA, which
includes Mexico).

<h2>Green Accounting</H2>
A number of countries in LAC, including Chile, Colombia,
Costa Rica, and Mexico, are using some form of green accounting
or natural resource accounting. Green accounting addresses the
shortcoming of traditional national accounting, known as the System
of National Accounts (SNA). Green accounting is based on the concept
that a proper assessment of a country's income and wealth needs
to account for the contributions of activities made by all sectors
of the economy and their impact on resource depletion and degradation.
Traditional SNA ignores the value of resources (on and in the
ground) as well as the value of environmental degradation. Therefore,
it gives a false impression of income and wealth and often leads
policy-makers to ignore or destroy the environment to further
economic development. Incorporating the real value of natural
resources as well as their depletion and degradation allows for
better allocation of priorities, thereby helping to address the
causes of current major environmental problems including the over-exploitation
of natural resources such as forests.
<P>
 To date there have been two main approaches to green
accounting. The first approach is to create separate or &quot;satellite&quot;
accounts alongside the traditional national accounts, which capture
changes in natural resources but do not integrate them within
the framework of the traditional SNA. Satellite accounts are the
most common form of environmental accounting now in use. These
accounts allow for the valuation of resource use and depletion
as well as estimations of expenditures for environmental protection
to be made. This valuation allows countries to maintain accounts
of annual resource use and depletion. While satellite accounts
are linked to the existing system of national accounts, they are
not an integral part of them.
<P>
 The other approach is to integrate environmental accounts
with the traditional SNA. For this approach, countries must modify
their existing system of national accounts to incorporate environmental
assets, such as subsoil reserves. The integration of natural resources,
however, is limited to easily valued resources (such as oil, coal,
and timber) and as yet does not account for all environmental
aspects, particularly environmental pollution.
<P>
 The United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD) is
co-ordinating the development of a more all-encompassing and integrated
green accounting system. In the early 1990s, UNSD proposed a new
accounting framework called the Integrated System of Environmental
and Economic Accounts (IEEA). The system integrates environmental
issues into conventional national accounts. Some countries, such
as Colombia and Mexico, have experimented using this system, although
in parallel to the traditional SNA rather than as the traditional
system. In the long run, the IEEA system could replace the traditional
SNA and thereby make the environment an integral part of national
accounting systems.
<P>
 From green accounting systems such as the IEEA, green
indicators can be developed to augment traditional economic indicators
such as GDP. Green indicators take into account the environment,
while traditional indicators such as GDP, drawn from the traditional
national accounts system, have little or no consideration for
the environment. The eco-domestic product (EDP) is one such green
indicator-an environmentally adjusted measure of net domestic
product. EDP helps to highlight the value of resource depletion
missed by GDP. For example, a country that exports minerals but
has limited remaining reserves would show an EDP that is significantly
lower than its GDP. Such green indicators would serve as an aid
to policy setting and enable more informed decision-making regarding
resource allocation and economic development. Of course, better
accounting does not necessarily result in better environmental
policies.

<p>In recent years, some specific environmental
treaties, conventions, and agreements have also been signed, including the Treaty of Amazon Co-
operation (<I>Tratado de Cooperaci&oacute;n Amaz&oacute;nica</I>), the Caribbean
Convention for Environmental Protection, the Caribbean Action Plan for the Sustainable
Development of Island States, the Program of Action for Tropical Forestry (<I>Programa de
Acci&oacute;n Forestal Tropical</I>), and the Permanent Commission of the South
Pacific (<I>Comisi&oacute;n Permanente del Pac&iacute;fico Sur)</I>.
<p>In Central America, the
treaties and alliances include the Central American Alliance for Sustainable Development
(<I>Alianza Centroamericana de Desarrollo Sostenible</I>), the Central American
Commission of Environment and Development (<I>Comisi&oacute;n Centroamericana de
Ambiente y Desarrollo</I>, CCAD) (see <a href="#b3.17">Box 3.17</a>), and the Central American Council of
Forests and Protected Areas (<I>Consejo Centroamericano de Bosques y Areas
Protegidas</I>). With the signature of NAFTA, a North American Commission on
Environmental Cooperation has also been created to guarantee that the free trade agreement does
not harm the environment.
<p>These alliances,
agreements, and commissions indicate growing recognition of the need to confront environmental
problems at a regional level and to jointly plan the sustainable use of regional natural resources.
Large ecosystems, such as Amazonia, the Andes, the Central American tropical forests, the
Southern Pacific, and the Caribbean small island states are similarly considered. The treaties also
serve as vital catalysts in sparking international co-operation among NGOs, Governments, and
international institutions in designing and implementing environmental policies. Regional and
subregional alliances have also played a fundamental role in the preparation of technical
documents establishing guiding principles, appropriate management procedures, and strategic
policies on regional environmental issues (CCAD, 1992; CDEA, 1992; CDMAALC, 1991; UN,
1994).
<p>An example of the co-operation initiated by these
agreements is the Treaty of Amazon Co-operation (<I>Tratado de Cooperaci&oacute;n
Amaz&oacute;nica</I>). With its signature, a Special Commission for the Amazonian
Environment was created in 1989, which operates eight environmental programmes in different
countries. Important efforts such as the Amazonian Network of Protected Areas (SURAPA)
operate as a result of these programmes, allowing for co-ordination of subregional efforts. Through
their joint environmental programmes, the Caribbean Countries played an extremely important role
in the preparation of the <I>Programme of Action for Small Island States</I> presented at
UNCED, and in the organization of the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of
Small Island States held in Barbados in 1994. These two events have played a major role in
raising awareness and promoting discussion on the critical problems of sustainability for small
island states.
<p>Another positive programme that has emerged from the plethora of agreements in Central
America is the Alliance for Sustainable Development (<I>Alianza Centroamericana de
Desarrollo Sostenible</I>). Initiated in October 1994 by the seven Central American
Presidents, this has been instrumental in promoting co-ordinated bilateral or multilateral actions for
the management of protected areas, particularly those located along national borders, through the
establishment of neighbouring reserves and biological corridors spanning borders. The Alliance
has emerged as a forum in which various interested parties discuss and identify priority actions. In
1995, for example, to implement the forestry, biodiversity, and environmental law
commitments made by Alliance signatories, CCAD and The World Conservation Union
(IUCN) convened a planning workshop in Panama to identify priorities and collaborating
organizations across the region. Some 100 representatives from Governments, NGOs, the
business sector, research institutions, and grassroots organizations from the seven Central
American countries attended  (WRI, 1995).
<p>There is also an annual Meeting of the Ministers of
the Environment for LAC organized in co-operation with UNEP's regional office for LAC. Its main
objectives, as reiterated at the Ninth Meeting in Cuba in 1995, are fourfold: to guide the
implementation of the environmental agenda of LAC; to identify opportunities for regional co-
operation in environmental matters conducive to the implementation of Agenda 21; to propose
measures to achieve greater effectiveness and coherence in the regional planning and
implementation of the environmental agendas of international agencies; and to reach agreement
on common positions concerning topics of importance to the international environmental agenda
with implications for the LAC region (UNEP, 1995a).

<h2>Central American Commission for Environment and Development (CCAD)</H2>
The Central American Commission for Environment
and Development (CCAD) is an excellent example of regional-level
policy setting in Central America. It was created in 1989 by the
Presidents of Central America and is composed of the heads of
the ministries and agencies most directly responsible for environmental
policy in each of the seven Central American countries.
<P>
 The organization seeks to influence regional decision-makers
by facilitating the exchange of information and by providing a
forum in which different interest groups can address specific
regional issues. CCAD's principal mission is to promote policy
co-ordination, develop new funding, build institutional capacities,
make information available, and foster citizen participation in
addressing the region's pressing environmental and development
problems.
<P>
 CCAD has expanded from mainly a forum for discussions
of issues of common concern among Ministers responsible for the
environment to an organization involved in planning related to
regional environmental and development issues. The Commission
is now building its capacities to gather, organize, and distribute
information on environment and development in Central America.
<P>
 CCAD brings together representatives of Governments,
NGOs, grassroots groups, and international institutions to discuss
and analyse problems and develop policy recommendations and action
plans. It has designed a consultation methodology for elaborating
action plans and international conventions across the region.
Hundreds of individuals representing diverse interests discuss
and rank policy proposals for consideration by Presidents and
Parliaments.
<P>
 Examples of policies discussed include the Central
American Tropical Forest Action Plan (PAFTCA) sponsored by CCAD
in 1991. This initiative has drawn technical and financial support
for better forest management. The Forest Action Plan included
the Regional Convention for the Management and Conservation of
Natural Forest Ecosystems and the Development of Forest Plantations.
Signed in 1993, the convention provides a framework for policy
and institutional reform in the forestry sector.
<P>
 To pave the way for legal reform across the region,
CCAD helped create other regional bodies to bridge gaps between
Governments and civil organizations. The Central American Inter-Parliamentary
Commission on the Environment (CICAD), for instance, brings together
representatives of the legislatures from the seven countries to
press for ratification of international conventions and policy
reforms in national congresses.
<P>
 Acting on reports of toxic waste dumping, CCAD and
CICAD joined forces to help set up regional networks of NGOs and
Government bodies to monitor the dumping of wastes. Late in 1992,
the seven countries signed an agreement to ban the importation
or international transport of a wide range of hazardous materials.
Coupled with the networks' information and public education campaigns,
the ban is making illegal waste dumping difficult in the region.
<P>
 Other legal and institutional co-operation mechanisms
within CCAD's area of competence are the Central American Convention
on Climate Change (signed in May 1995), the Central American Convention
on Biodiversity (signed in June 1992), and efforts to promote
the adoption of the Central American Development Strategy or Central
American Alliance for Sustainable Development in 1994. More recently,
CCAD has participated in the creation of the Central American
Fund for Environment and Development.
<P>
 Throughout Central America, CCAD is also helping strengthen
national environmental agencies to foster public participation
in decision-making. In 1994, it initiated a project to train the
staff of Government environment agencies in Central America in
participatory methods for policy formulation.
<P>
 CCAD has access to the highest levels of policy-making.
This accounts for its success in getting NGOs, Ministers, and
Presidents to endorse its initiatives and proposals. The prestige
that Presidential support affords CCAD, the organization's commitment
to democratic processes, and its policy to remain small and agile
are instrumental to its success.
