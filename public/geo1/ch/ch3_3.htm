<h2>Current Changes in Approaches to Environmental  Policy</h2>
<h3>Cleaner and Leaner Production</h3>
As illustrated in the regional policy sections, countries
are moving towards cleaner production and eco-efficiency, and
a shift can be seen from cleaner processes to cleaner products
and/or services. Government environmental policies to stimulate
market partners to move from end-of-pipe solutions to more integral
approaches and accounting on a &quot;cradle-to-grave&quot; basis
are being tested in a number of countries. Cleaner, more resource-efficient
production applies not only to industrial production processes,
but also to agriculture, fisheries, forestry, transportation,
and so on. There is an obvious and urgent need to distribute this
knowledge and expertise world-wide.
<P>
Cleaner production is &quot;the continuous improvement of industrial
processes and products to reduce the use of resources and energy;
to prevent the pollution of air, water, and land; to reduce wastes
at source; and to minimize risks to the human population and the
environment&quot; (UNEP, 1994a). Increasing the sustainability
of products and services can be achieved by such measures as
(UNEP/IE, RIVM,ILO, and Wuppertal Institute,
personal communication, 1996):
<UL>
<LI><I>input substitution</I>: using less toxic
material; using materials with a longer service lifetime;
<p>
<LI>technology change</I>: replacing
technology or process sequence to increase resource efficiency
and to minimize waste and emission rates;
<p>
<LI><I>equipment modification</I>: changing existing
equipment and utilities to run processes at higher resource efficiency
and at lower waste and emission rates;
<P>
<LI><I>better process control</I>: using working
procedures, machine instructions, and process record keeping to
run processes at higher efficiency and at lower waste and emission
rates;
<P>
<LI><I>good housekeeping</I>:
preventing leaks and spills, and enforcing existing working instructions;
<P>
<LI><I>on-site re-use</I>:
using waste in the same process or for other useful applications
within the company;
<P>
<LI><I>production of useful by-products</I>:
modifying waste generation processes in order to promote re-use
outside the company;
<P>
<LI><I>changes in product design</I>:
reducing resource use and waste and  emission rates; and
<P>
<LI><I>improved management</I>:
ensuring a safe and healthy working environment, with good collaboration
between management and workers, effective training, and development
of partnerships among stakeholders in the enterprise and the community.
</UL>
<P>
The key difference between pollution
control and cleaner and leaner production is one of timing: from
&quot;notice and treat&quot; to &quot;anticipate and prevent&quot;
or from &quot;cure&quot; to &quot;prevention.&quot; Cleaner production
leads to reductions of resource use and in amounts of waste and
emissions generated. Achievable reductions of 50 per
cent to 75 per cent are more and more the rule rather than the
exception; reductions of 90 per cent are no
longer uncommon either. (See Box 3.4.) The challenge is to achieve
increases in efficiency and reductions in pollution and other
forms of degradation by about one order of magnitude, as several
prominent figures from different countries are advocating through
the international Factor 10 Club they established in 1995 (Factor
10 Club, 1995).

In &quot;Factor Four&quot; (Weizs&auml;cker
<I>et al.,</I> 1996), an impressive number of examples
is presented to support the message of the Factor Ten Club. These
examples combine changes in thinking, systems, and technologies
that lead to reductions in resource efficiency of a factor of
four or more. All these examples are combinations of available
technologies:
<UL>
<LI> super windows (factor 4),
<P>
<LI> super refrigerators (factor 10),
<P>
<LI> user-oriented
and least-cost power plant management (factor 4),
<P>
<LI> CD-ROM versus paper (factor 50),
<P>
<LI> water use in paper manufacturing
(factor 40), and
<P>
<LI> marketing of low-transport
products (factor 4 to 100).
</UL>
The UNEP Industry
and Environment Office has compiled concrete examples of cleaner
production applied by companies in different regions of the world.
They illustrate real achievements in waste and emission reduction
and in raw material and energy use with factors ranging from 2
to 10. All examples given have an attractive payback time and
were beneficial for the companies from various perspectives. They
include:
<UL>
<LI>enzymatic bleach cleanup
in cotton dying versus rinsing (factor 2 in water use, factor
5 in energy use), Denmark;
<P>
<LI>waste generation in sugar
milling and refining (factor 10 in wastewater, factor 2 in lead
subacetate), the Philippines;
<P>
<LI> emission abatement in coking works (factor 10 in
hydrogen cyanide, toluene, benzene, xylene, and hydrogen sulphide),
Poland;
<P>
<LI> zero wastewater in metal finishing (factor 10 and
more in water, chemicals, and sludge), Spain;
<P>
<LI> fewer toxic wastes in leather tanning (zero production
of sulfides and foul smells, factor 4 in consumption of chromium
sulfate), Tunisia;
<P>
<LI> treatment of wastewater in the rubber industry (factor
10 in BOD and COD reduction, factor 9 in water use), Malaysia;
<P>
<LI> automating the bicycle wheel plating process (factor
1.5 in wastewater reduction; factor 10 in chrome discharge), China.

On a macro-economic level, resource productivity refers to the
total quantity of resources consumed to provide services and goods
such as housing, transport, medical care, higher education, and
export products for a given number of people (or within certain
geographical or political boundaries) for a certain period of
time. A country's total resource productivity can be accounted
for by adding all resource inputs generated within the borders
and those that were imported, and then subtracting the resource
inputs exported. These material intensity and flow accounts aim
to quantify the efficiency of economic operations; to consider
how much material and energy is used, by whom, and how it is distributed;
and to establish global patterns in the origin and movement of
materials and energy.
<P>
Currently several initiatives are under way to calculate the material
intensity of production processes and the flows of materials within
and between nations. Their goal is to draw attention to the wasteful
use of resources and promote resource efficiency. Such accounts
can highlight policy opportunities for increasing resource productivity
and can provide a way to assess the ecological quality of products
and services, expressed in resource intensity throughout life
cycles. (See Box 3.5.)

<H2>Material Intensity and Flow Accounts</H2>
In Germany, the Wuppertal Institute, in co-operation
with the German Federal Statistical Office, developed an overall
material flow account that provides a physical mass balance-domestic
extraction from the environment, domestic deposition and release
to the environment, imports, and exports. The account includes
elements such as water, abiotic (non-renewable) and biotic (renewable)
raw materials, soil and its erosion, emissions into the atmosphere
(such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and sulphur dioxide),
and oxygen for combustion. The total material input indicator
derived from these accounts can be regarded as a highly aggregated
measure that relates pressures from the physical basis of the
German economy to the global environment.
<P>
The analysis carried out in Germany found that the
relative dependence on a material-intensive supply is greatest
for the energy sector, the iron and steel industry, and the construction
sector. The energy sector was also found to be responsible for
a high level of direct extraction of domestic primary material.
The construction sector was found to be the most material-intensive.
As a result, these two industrial sectors in Germany will be primary
targets for dematerialization policies, which aim at reducing
both material and energy intensity.

Although these attempts to look at macro-economic performance
in an alternative way are currently limited and anecdotal, they
hold the promise of providing different insights in how society
operates, thus opening new avenues of dealing with environmental
management.
