<h2>Polar Regions</h2>
<h2>The Antarctic</h2>
<h3>Regional Data Collection and Information
Sharing </h3>
The Antarctic Treaty provides for the unrestricted exchange
and access of data and information on the Antarctic. This need
was endorsed by the consensus text of Chapter 17 of Agenda 21,
on the protection of oceans, seas, and their living resources.
<P>
 Several collaborative, long-term data collection and exchange
programmes are under way in the Antarctic. States Parties to the
Antarctic Treaty convened the First Meeting of Experts on Environmental
Monitoring in Antarctica in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in June 1992.
The group made recommendations, among other matters, on the representation
of monitoring sites, data management, the need to develop data
standards, and international co-ordination. A further workshop
has since been held in two sessions (17-20 October 1995 in Oslo,
Norway, and 25-29 March 1996 in College Station, Texas, United
States), the report of which will be submitted to the 1997 session
of the ATCM.
<P>
 Another item on the ATCM agenda is the preparation of a comprehensive
state of the environment report for the Antarctic. At the Twentieth
	ATCM in May 1996, it was suggested that the Scientific
	Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) of the
	International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU)
	consider and provide advice on this matter. At the
	August 1996 SCAR Meeting,
the production of a state of the Antarctic environment report
was discussed. It was considered both appropriate and essential
that SCAR should support efforts in concert with other interested
parties to produce an authoritative assessment of this key region.
SCAR expects to appoint a small steering committee in the very
near future to initiate discussions with other organizations on
the scope and content of such a report. SCAR will report back
on these discussions to the 1997 ATCM.
<P>
Such a report would for the first time draw together into an accessible
and easily interpreted form a wide variety of data dispersed throughout
the Antarctic literature and environmental databases world-wide.
Such a report would also provide a means of communicating with
all members of the global community and informing them about Antarctica.
<P>
A second long-term data collection programme involves the Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, which has a Regional
Committee for the Southern Ocean that addresses a variety of issues
including pollution and human impact. The IOC is strengthening
international research programmes in co-operation with other organizations
(ICSU/Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research/SCAR, CCAMLR, the
International Whaling Commission [IWC], World Meteorological Organization
[WMO], and UNEP) to improve ocean observations and data exchange
in the Southern Ocean. The IOC aims to meet requirements of Agenda
21 (Chapter 17), the Framework Convention on Climate Change, the
Convention on Biological Diversity, and the Madrid Protocol.
<P>
CCAMLR has a Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring
and Management. This group has constructed a framework that will
allow information collected from established monitoring programmes
to be integrated into management advice (CCAMLR, 1996).&lt;%0&gt;
<P>
In 1996, the IWC broadened the scope of its monitoring programme
with the introduction of the Southern Ocean Whale and Ecosystem
Research Programme, which will include research into the effects
of environmental change on cetaceans. Other research programmes
in the Southern Ocean target blue, humpback, and southern right
whales. The IWC also aims to improve collaboration with organizations
working on related issues in the Southern Ocean, such as CCAMLR,
SCAR, the IOC, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
<P>
With 37 land-based stations operated by 15 countries, the Antarctic
is an important component of WMO observing systems. The
stations contribute to the World Weather Watch programme and some
of them also monitor trace gas constituents such as carbon dioxide
and ozone as part of the Global Atmosphere Watch. WMO has noted
that financial constraints may threaten the continuity of some
stations with valuable long-term climatic records.
