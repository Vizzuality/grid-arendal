<H3>Underlying Causes</H3>

The driving forces behind North America s environmental
concerns vary considerably and are undergoing important changes.
<P>
The single most important driving force in North America has been
economic growth and the pattern of production and consumption
that has come to be associated with it. In the last 25 years,
for instance, the gross national product (GNP) of the U.S. economy
increased fivefold (PCSD, 1996). The United States, with a GNP
of more than US$6.4 trillion in 1994, is the world s largest economy
and the largest consumer of natural resources (PCSD, 1996). The
nation consumes more than 4.5 billion metric tons of materials
annually to produce goods and services (PCSD, 1996).
<P>
North Americans are among the world s heaviest
consumers of energy. With just 5 per cent of the world s population,
the United States accounts for 25 per cent of global energy use
on an annual basis (PCSD, 1996). Canada has a per capita consumption
of energy similar to the U.S. (319 gigajoules per capita per year
in 1993) (WRI/UNEP/UNDP/ WB, 1996). These consumption
patterns have an impact on global climate and could, through global
warming impose severe problems in the future for drinking water
supply as well as for the agricultural and forestry sector of
North America s economy.
<P>
The trend towards single family households and the growing number
of private cars in use (an average of one for every two people)
have contributed most significantly to increasing energy consumption.
In 1990, more than half the dwellings constructed in Canada were
single-family homes (Government of Canada, 1991). The
corresponding increase in energy demands in Canada is being tempered
through energy conservation programmes, increased energy
efficiency, and consumer awareness. In the United States between
1950 and 1990, there was a 400-per-cent increase in the number
of vehicles in the country and a 270-per-cent increase in the
number of licensed drivers. Here also, emphasis is now
being placed on energy efficiency and on renewable resources.
<P>
There are signs that patterns of production and consumption
may be shifting and that a &quot;de-materialization&quot; of GNP
may occur, as the service sector expands rapidly. There is also
evidence that production processes are becoming less resource-intensive
even for conventional industrial products (Wernick et
al., 1996). Moreover, changes seem to be taking place in the way
people work and spend their leisure time. If harnessed, these
changes could fundamentally alter the trade-off between economic
and social welfare and environmental stewardship.
<P>
A recent survey suggests that North American attitudes to materialism
are changing. For example, 83 per cent of those surveyed believe
that the United States consumes too much, and 88 per cent believe
that protecting the environment will require &quot;major changes
in the way we live.&quot; However, only 51 per cent
agree that their own buying habits have a negative impact on the
environment. (Merck, 1996). The survey also found that millions
of Americans are already &quot;downshifting,&quot; or choosing
to scale back their salaries and life-styles to reflect a different
set of priorities. Twenty-eight per cent of the survey respondents
said that, in the last five years, they had voluntarily
made changes in their lives (not including regularly scheduled
retirements) that resulted in making less money (Merck, 1996).<P>
