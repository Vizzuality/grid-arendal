Great strides have been taken in the West Asia region
over the past two decades in the development and strengthening
of environmental institutions and legislation.
<P>
Initiatives to protect the environment at the national level have
depended mainly on command and control mechanisms, particularly
legislation. The main avenues for the implementation of environmental
policy in the region have been national institutions co-ordinating
environmental management and enforcing laws (e.g., Ministries,
General Directorates and the Environment Protection Councils or
Secretariats) and the setting of standards and norms through legislation.
<P>
Recent socio-economic changes have also brought policy changes
that had environmental implications. Unprecedented urban and industrial
growth in the region, particularly in the Gulf States,
has resulted in increased demand for natural resources and rates
of waste generation (both domestic and industrial). In addition,
structural adjustment programmes have led the governments of some
countries in the region to suspend many government-supported activities,
including environmental planning.
<P>
In addition, the hostilities in the region over the last two decades
have caused large population migrations towards marginal land
and water resources. This, along with the lack of adequate waste
disposal and/or treatment, has also posed a serious threat to
the environment and human health in the region.
<P>
<A NAME="eninst"></A><b>Environmental Institutions</b>
<P>
<A NAME="tab3_3"></A>All countries of the
region now have environmental institutions or ministries in place,
with many countries having restructured these institutions in
the recent past. (See <a href="../tab/tab3_3.htm">Table 3.3.</a>) In some countries the newly
established or restructured institutions were given higher political
standing. At present four countries have ministers for environment
in their cabinets, namely Oman (Ministry of Regional Municipalities
and Environment), Jordan (Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs
and Environment), Bahrain (Ministry of Housing, Municipalities
and Environment), and Syria (Minister of State for the Environment
heading the General Commission for Environmental Affairs).
<P>
Of these countries, Oman was the
first to establish a Ministry for Environment and Water
in 1984. This Ministry, along with the Council for Conservation
of the Environment and Prevention of Pollution were then
merged into a new Ministry of Regional Municipalities and Environment
in 1991. The Syrian Government created a Ministry of State for
Environmental Affairs to act as the advisory body for co-ordinating
environmental issues between the Ministries, setting environmental
standards, carrying out environmental studies, monitoring
pollution, and developing environmental guidelines.
<P>
Most other countries of the region
have also established environmental institutions, although not
necessarily at Cabinet levels. General Directorates
for environment or similar governmental bodies were established
in Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Environmental
Protection Councils have been replaced by Environmental Authorities
at the General Directorate level in Bahrain and Kuwait.
<P>
The United Arab Emirates issued a federal law in 1993 creating
the Federal Environment Agency, which is the first country-wide
institution with legal powers to protect and conserve the environment
(UNEP, 1995). Recently, the West Bank and Gaza Authority also established
a central institution for environmental management and introduced
legislation for resource protection.
<P>
In Lebanon, the Ministry of Environment was established in 1993.
Saudi Arabia established the Meteorology and Environmental Protection
Administration (MEPA) by Royal Decree in 1981. MEPA is now the
central agency responsible for environment at the national level.
Saudi Arabia has also established environmental sections in other
relevant ministries, namely, in the Ministry of Agriculture and
Water, the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, the Ministry
of Municipalities and Rural Affairs, the Ministry of Industry
and Electricity, and the Ministry of Health. Some countries in
the region have also created separate bodies to deal with specific
environmental sectors (for example, the national committees and
commissions for wildlife conservation and development in Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Jordan, Kuwait, and Syria).
<P>
Despite the plethora of new institutions, however, programmes,
laws, and institutions have often been	created haphazardly and
are generally sectoral. In most countries, different institutions
are responsible for agriculture, water, fisheries, mineral resources,
development, human settlements, industry, transport, and tourism.
<P>
Recent recognition of the inter-sectoral nature of many environmental
concerns has led to an increasing number of Governments developing
cross-cutting policy institutions. These commonly take the form
of inter-ministerial or interdepartmental committees, and national
environmental strategies developed with sectoral departments.
<P>
Only a few Governments, however, have created
high-level, cross-cutting bodies under the direct control of the
Head of Government (in Oman, for instance) or a senior minister
(ESCWA, 1996). Due to this weakness in organizational structure,
as well as shortcomings of the consultative machinery, there has
been a lack of national integrated environmental policy in some
countries. Furthermore, environmental departments almost everywhere
have limited staff and budgets in relation to the demands made
on them. There is therefore a lack of resources for implementing
agreed policy or enforcement of law (ESCWA, 1996).
<P>
<A NAME="env"></A><b>Environmental Legislation</b>
<P>
The countries in West Asia have passed numerous laws
dealing with the environment. In Kuwait, as early as 1964, the
first law was passed to protect navigable water from oil pollution.
Articles 15, 16, and 21 of the constitution of Kuwait were subsequently
amended in 1976 and in 1980 to incorporate environmental protection
principles and to establish mechanisms to enforce the implementation
of environmental laws.
<P>
Despite the often fragmented nature of organizational
responsibilities for the environment, legislation in the region
has been fairly cross-sectoral and all-encompassing since the
1980s. These laws, sometimes known as framework laws,
have helped countries reorder fragmented approaches to environmental
management.
<P>
Framework laws in the region include:
<ul>
<li> the Decree for Establishment of the Environmental Protection
Committee in Bahrain (1980);
<P>
<li> Iraq's Environment Protection and Improvement Act (1986);
<P>
<LI> the Law Protecting the Environment in Kuwait (1980);
<P>
<LI> the Decree Creating the Council for Protection of Environment
and Pollution Control (1979) and the Act for Environment Protection
and Pollution Control in Oman (1979, amended 1985);
<P>
<LI> Saudi Arabia's Environmental Protection Standards (1982);
and
<P>
<LI>the Decree Concerning Establishment
of the Supreme Committee for Environment and Its Mandate in the
United Arab Emirates (1981).
</ul>
More recent attempts at harmonization of environmental legislation
and institutions have also taken place. For example, the Jordanian
Parliament ratified an environmental law in 1995 establishing
an independent General Corporation for Environment Protection.
Yemen has elaborated and ratified environmental laws and established
national or independent authorities for environmental protection.
Recently, the Palestinian Authority established
a central institution for environmental management and introduced
legislation for resource protection. Lebanon has also reviewed
all existing environmental legislation. A legal environment code
and a law for the protection of natural sites and monuments were
developed. Moreover, an environmental impact assessment decree
and procedural guidelines have been prepared. All these laws have
been discussed in national consultations.
<P>
The enforcement of existing laws is critical for the protection
of the region's environment. Many states have imposed new types
of liability or increased penalties for environmental offences
in order to secure better environmental quality. In Bahrain, for
example, any person found guilty of causing oil pollution in the
marine environment or of dumping in territorial waters wastes
from ships or land-based sources is liable to large fines. Violators
are also responsible for the cleanup of the contaminated area
within a specific time (UNEP, 1995).
<P>
Although most countries of the region have adequate legislation,
there remains a need for revision, amendment, and the introduction
of new legislation. Norms, standards, and monitoring are generally
inadequate, and most countries and the region require assistance
to remedy the situation and put into place effective enforcement
mechanisms (UNEP, 1995).
<P>
<A NAME="neaps"></A><b>Environmental Action Plans</b>
<P>
West Asian countries have made substantial efforts at
the national level to integrate	 environmental dimensions into
their development schemes and strategies. While prior to the 1990s
these plans simply concentrated on development strategies, some
countries now incorporate environmental policies and resource
management principles. However, while most countries have developed
strategies and action plans, they continue to lack adequate resources
for their implementation.
<P>
In Jordan's five-year development plan for 1986-90, the environment
appeared for the first time as an independent sector. In addition,
in 1996 a National Environment Action Plan was formulated for
the Kingdom. Oman also has a comprehensive environmental planning
and management system that ensures that development takes into
account environmental concerns.
<P>
With desertification being a major concern in the region, countries
have responded by launching national action plans to combat desertification.
Their main elements include assessment of desertification and
improved land management, public corrective measures against droughts
and their impacts, institutional arrangements for building the
capacity of personnel, and international co-operation. The National
Action Plan for Combating Desertification in Bahrain, for instance,
emphasizes appropriate land management practices, water management
measures, strengthening of science and technology, and international
action and co-operation.
<P>
Similarly, because water
issues are a major concern, several national action plans have
been initiated and implemented. For example, in Oman, the Government
has started several regional activities to conserve and protect
water resources from pollution and to increase public awareness
of such pressing environmental issues as the scarcity of water
resources and the importance of protecting biodiversity. In Kuwait,
a water quality monitoring programme was established in 1986 in
parallel with an air quality monitoring programme. Sea water quality
monitoring sites have been established in the coastal areas, especially
around desalination plants. A monthly monitoring programme of
drinking-water quality is implemented in accordance with World
Health Organization (WHO) drinking-water monitoring
guidelines. The countries of the East Mediterranean
region, such as Lebanon and Syria, have begun to elaborate integrated
coastal management programmes and regional environmental assessment
initiatives, in line with environmental assessment initiatives
and priorities in their respective countries.
<P>
Syria has initiated the preparation of background papers on the
environmental situation at all seven national river basins to
be used to compile a sustainable development strategy and to develop
relevant action plans required to respond to the identified needs
and priorities. The papers are being prepared through an interactive
participatory approach involving various governmental, academic,
and research institutions, as well as local authorities and groups.
The environmental effects of industrial, agricultural, and domestic
activities, as well as socio-economic issues, are assessed in
these papers.
<P>
<A NAME="tab3_4"></A>To help combat the pressures on the region's biodiversity, particularly
due to habitat destruction, some countries of the region have
begun to establish protected areas. Protected areas now total
over 24 million hectares, some 6 per cent of the total area of
the West Asia region (ESCWA/FAO, 1995). (See <a href="../tab/tab3_4.htm">Table 3.4.</a>)
<P>
<A NAME="ecfin"></A><b>Economic and Financial Instruments</b>
<P>
Various economic instruments are also in use in the
region to help promote sustainable development. In Bahrain, Oman,
UAE, and Kuwait, for example, soft loans are available for introducing
water-saving irrigation techniques (e.g., drip irrigation) to
relieve some of the pressure on groundwater resources. Some countries
have also implemented programmes to promote intensive protected
agriculture (e.g., greenhouses) in order to help improve water
productivity.
<P>
Instruments using the polluter pays principle also exist in the
region. In Syria, for example, a municipal service operation levy
has been introduced for domestic and private institutions with
regard to the collection of solid wastes. These rates differ according
to quantities of waste generated and collected. In Lebanon, preparations
are underway to introduce economic tools, such as taxation and
incentives, for air pollution management. These tools will be
integrated within the action plan and legislation for air pollution.
<P>
<A NAME="publ"></A><b>Public Participation and Capacity Building</b>
<P>
A growing number of
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are found in most countries
of the region. However, their role in planning and implementation
needs to be strengthened. In addition, there is a need for capacity
building to increase the involvement  of NGOs as well as other
institutions and the private sector in the environmental policy-making
and action cycle. Although in most countries initiatives for capacity
building are in place, these need to be turned into reality (UNEP,
1996). The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
has initiated various programmes in the region for environmental
management that are more specifically addressing capacity building
issues in the context of UNDP's Capacity 21 efforts. The UNDP
Regional Bureau for Arab States has assisted in the initiation
of projects funded by the Global Environment Facility, with strong
capacity building components in the areas of biodiversity, climate
change, and international waters.
<P>
Environmental technology transfer is still at a limited level
in the region. Some initiatives, however, are in existence. One
initiative is to circulate successful examples of environmental
technologies by the Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for
Environment (CAMRE). Adequate technology transfer should be considered
in parallel with the development of improved capacities and human
resources.
<P>
A recent survey of tertiary-level environmental training institutions
in the West Asia region revealed that more than 35 university
research and training institutions are engaged in environmental
training programmes. Collectively, these institutions teach more
than 290 regular undergraduate and graduate environment courses
as well as providing training courses and seminars. Graduate studies
of environmental issues are available at 12 universities in the
region. Courses on environment have also been incorporated into
the teaching programmes of schools in most countries of the region
(UNEP/ ROWA, 1994).
<P>
<A NAME="eninf"></A><b>Environmental Information</b>
<P>
There is a general lack of data and information on the
environment in West Asia. Where information is available in the
region, there is a lack of continuity and cohesion in the environmental
monitoring and reporting. Much of the information produced
is also under-utilized (UNEP, 1996).
<P>
At the national level, some countries have prepared state of the
environment reports (SOE) or environmental profiles of some form.
Kuwait, for example, has completed four SOE-type reports (1984,
1986, 1988, and 1992) (Environment Protection Council,
1992). Most of the countries of the region have not regularly
published such reports.
<P>
Specific environmental reports dealing with certain environmental
issues are also available in some countries. For example, reports
on desertification and plans of action to combat desertification
have been prepared in Oman, Bahrain, UAE, Jordan, Syria
and Yemen. These reports also include some information on the
state of environment in the respective countries.
<P>
Another common problem in the region is that environmental data
are scattered among numerous public and private-sector institutions,
with little or no collaboration or co-ordination. As a result,
there are gaps and duplication in data and the countries of the
region need to compile and standardize their information (Olivier
and Tell, 1995).
<P>
There is also little networking and integration of data for environmental
assessment, except occasionally at the sectoral level, such as
for water. Initiatives for the development of information for
problem solving and networking have been undertaken in Syria and
Lebanon, largely due to UNDP's Sustainable Development Network
and Capacity 21 Projects. Nevertheless, effective environment
information networks for the dissemination of data nationally
and regionally still need to be put in place in much of the region
(Olivier and Tell, 1995).
