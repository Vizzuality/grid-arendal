<h2>North America</h2>
<h3>Focusing Research, Technology, and Education</h3>
The ability to achieve sustainable development depends
on scientific knowledge of the earth's natural systems and the
ways in which human activities affect these systems. Accurate
information built on basic scientific research establishes the
foundation of knowledge needed for sound decision-making by individuals,
businesses, governments, and society as a whole (PCSD, 1996).
<P>
North America attaches great importance to research, technology,
information, and education. Technology, the so-called engine of
economic growth, is considered responsible for as much as two
thirds of the increase in U.S. productivity since the Great Depression
of the 1930s. Technological advances depend on continuing research
and development (R&amp;D) (NSTC, 1996). The U.S. gross domestic
expenditure on R&amp;D in 1995 was approximately US$167 billion,
amounting to 2.81 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Canadian
expenditure on R&amp;D for the same year was about US$8 billion,
1.51 per cent of GDP (OECD, 1995).
<P>
Private funds have become increasingly important in this area
as Federal programmes in both Canada and the United States feel
the effects of budget constraints. Overall, industry funds nearly
60 per cent of U.S. and 41 per cent of Canadian outlays for R&amp;D.
(The average for members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development in 1995 was slightly more than 50 per cent.)
Nonetheless, Government commitments to basic science and energy
research remain firm where long-term potential for great scientific
discovery compensates for a lack of immediate commercial interest
(EC, 1996c; NSTC, 1996).
<P>
In recent years, the environmental
sector has become a growth industry: world-wide sales in 1992
amounted to US$300 billion and are expected to reach US$425 billion
by 1997. The United States has the largest segment of the industry,
with total estimated domestic and international sales
of US$1340 billion (SBA, 1996). The market
for prevention tech-nologies rose by almost 15 per cent in 1992
and 1993. Other high-growth areas include technologies for resource
recovery and energy conservation. More generally, this sector
is dominated by service providers, which account for 74 per cent
of total revenues. Most of these services focus on the cleanup
of past environmental problems (NSTC, 1996).
<P>
The environmental sector in Canada is also one of its fastest-growing
industries. With nearly 4,500 mostly small- and medium-sized firms
employing more than 150,000 workers and annual sales of about
US $8 billion a year, this sector has become a significant contributor
to the Canadian economy (Marchi, 1996; CEI, 1996). These companies
offer the technologies, products, and services that permit innovative
solutions for the treatment and prevention of pollution and state-of-the-art
environmental management services. The Technology Partnerships
Canada Program of Industry Canada, announced in the 1996 budget,
is expected to encourage the development of Canada's increasingly
important environmental technology industry. Beyond the US$443
million over three years allocated from the Canadian budget, this
programme is designed to leverage more than US$738 million in
private-sector investment for new and innovative technologies
(Marchi, 1996).
<P>
Science and technology (S&amp;T) related activities account for
most of Environment Canada's expenditures. About one fifth of
S&amp;T is devoted to research and development. Overall, S&amp;T
is delivered through three programme activities (Atmospheric Environment,
Environmental Protection, and Environmental Conservation) that
are conducted through mutually reinforcing strategic business
lines: reducing risks to human health and the environment; providing
weather forecasts and warnings and emergency preparedness services;
and giving Canadians the tools to build a greener society (EC,
1996b; Canadian Dept. of Foreign Affairs and International Trade,
personal communication, 1996).
<P>
One Canadian S&amp;T initiative is the development of a series
of long-term, multidisciplinary research and monitoring sites-the
Ecological Monitoring and Assessment Network (EMAN). The aim of
EMAN is to understand what changes are occurring in the ecosystem
and the specific or multiple causes of those changes. The Network
is building on existing sites that have been in operation
for years as well as establishing new ones as issues emerge (Can.
Dept. of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 1996b). Across
the Federal Government in Canada, there is also progress in working
together and collaborating on sustainable development S&amp;T.
In 1995, the four natural-resource-based departments (Environment
Canada, Natural Resources Canada, Fisheries and Oceans, and Agriculture
and Agri-Food Canada) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on
S&amp;T for Sustainable Development. Through this spirit of interdepartmental
co-operation, great efficiencies have been found, and progress
is being made on such issues as climate change.
<P>
Both countries have initiated educational
programmes for schoolchildren about environmental issues. The
Government of Canada continues to support Learning for a Sustainable
Future, a non-governmental, not-for-profit organization whose
long-term goal is to integrate the principles of sustainable
development in all aspects of curriculum in the formal education
sector. In addition, through its Action 21 Programme, Environment
Canada provides financial support to communities to implement
local action programmes. Both these initiatives have grown out
of the work Environment Canada did in the early 1990s under the
banner of its &quot;environmental citizenship&quot; initiative.
The U.S. Government has launched the Global Learning and Observations
to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) programme, a concept that has
expanded to more than 60 countries. This international environmental,
science, and education initiative creates a partnership between
students, teachers, and the scientific research community that
actively involves the students in data collection and observation.
