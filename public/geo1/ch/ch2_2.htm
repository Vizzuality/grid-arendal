<P>
<A NAME="lan"></A><STRONG>Land</STRONG>
<P>
Issues pertaining to land are of greatest
concern in regions where food security is a priority, notably
in Africa and West Asia. Land availability, abatement of land
degradation, and efficient land management are driven by the food
security demands of growing populations, which result in expanded
cultivation and agricultural intensification-unless met by food
trade.
<P>
In countries with limited economic resources, the food
trade option is not generally sufficient to cover the magnitude
of growing needs. Rapid introduction and
adoption of intensification technologies are also limited by economic
and cultural complexities, leaving the expansion
of cultivation into marginal lands and wilderness areas as the
prime short- to medium-term option for increasing production.
As a consequence, forests, woodlands, or grasslands are destroyed
or degraded and natural ecosystems are fragmented, with negative
impacts on biodiversity. Poor land management further
increases susceptibility of soils to erosion, reduces moisture
retention, and accelerates leaching of nutrients. Degradation
feeds back into a cycle of declining productivity and, in the
worst cases, desertification or the irreversible degeneration
of marginal lands.
<P>
Considerable anxiety still remains in several regions (Africa,
Asia-Pacific, and West Asia) where there is a relative scarcity
of land per capita and land quality is poor. Waterlogging, salinization,
and erosion (by both wind and water) of soil resources are of
special concern, while desertification remains a serious worry
in the drier zones of the regions. Loss of limited agricultural
land to alternative uses is another particular concern in West
Asia.
<P>
Human-made fire influences land degradation in the woodlands and
grasslands of Africa, and the problem is complicated by long-established
cultural practices. The residual impacts of civil conflict in
Africa also pose problems regarding the availability and degradation
of land. Significant tracts of land remain effectively inaccessible
due to the widespread laying of mines during past military conflicts
and the environmental impact of refugees is substantial in a number
of countries.
<P>
Limited land availability is also of particular concern to small
island states world-wide. Land degradation through erosion and
significant desertification of drylands in the past is an ongoing
problem in Latin America.  Despite the remaining high number of
natural ecosystems in Latin America, unrestrained expansion of
the agricultural frontier there could have serious impacts on
wilderness areas.
<P>
In Europe, problems of land degradation relate mainly
to irreversible erosion, acidification, and pollution of soils
and the subsequent economic impacts. Generally speaking,
soil degradation is no longer a priority concern in North America,
given the widespread adoption of conservation-based farming practices.
More attention is placed on problems relating to land pollution,
and water contamination. Improving poor agricultural practices,
where evident, is vigorously targetted in order to reduce erosion
and productivity losses.
<P>
<A NAME="for"></A><STRONG>Forests</STRONG>
<P>
The decline of natural forest in developing regions
has been considerable between 1980 and 1990. Total losses in the
tropics have been greatest in Latin America and the Caribbean,
followed by those in Africa and in Asia and the Pacific. Industrialization,
population growth and related agricultural expansion, and forest
product trade are the main driving forces in reducing forest cover
in these regions. Rates of deforestation are of particular concern
in Asia and the Pacific, and in the highland states of West Asia.
In West Asia, the opening up of woodlands has caused increased
susceptibility to erosion and land degradation in general.
<P>
In Africa, remaining forests are under great pressure from agricultural
expansion and the use of wood as fuel, with pressure likely to
increase with rising population, continued dependence on subsistence
agriculture, and an absence of alternatives to wood as fuel. Declining
productivity, increased climatic variability, and greater susceptibility
to flooding have also been attributed in part to accelerated deforestation
on the African continent.
<P>
Forest area is currently rather stable in Europe and North America,
as it has been for the past century. However, forests in Europe
suffer from acidification, and the boreal (northern) forests in
Siberia are being heavily exploited. The removal of old-growth
forests raises protests in North America and Europe.
<P>
<A NAME="bio"></A><STRONG>Biodiversity</STRONG>
<P>
Conservation of biodiversity is of concern in all regions,
with most countries having  adopted the principles of the Convention
on Biological Diversity. As a result, many have taken steps domestically
to protect and conserve natural habitats and related biodiversity.
The degree of success and national priority accorded to biodiversity
varies widely across regions, however.
<P>
Latin America accords biodiversity a high priority,
while Asia and the Pacific more recently accepted its legitimacy
as an issue of both national and international concern. Both Europe
and North America accord a high priority to the conservation of
biodiversity, although the United States has not signed the Convention
on Biological Diversity. Many African countries, with a view toward
the economic potential of revenues from wildlife tourism, also
recognize the need for biodiversity conservation.
<P>
Yet competition for scarce land resources and the rising demand
for food production represent important constraints. Habitat loss
caused by development pressure and the overexploitation of fisheries,
ground-water depletion, and hunting are threatening biodiversity.
Fish stocks in parts of North America and Europe have also been
seriously depleted. One of the more pernicious effects world-wide
of deforestation and the conversion of other natural lands such
as woodlands and grasslands is the fragmentation of habitats and
the negative effect this has on biodiversity.
<P>
<A NAME="wat"></A><STRONG>Water</STRONG>
<P>
On a global scale, the problem of water is more a case
of distribution and quality than one of quantity. Water is rarely
a region-wide concern, with some notable exceptions, but all regions
have some problems related to either ground-water or surface water
resources.
<P>
The development and efficient management of water resources is
of particular concern in West Asia and parts of Africa, particularly
the Sudano-Sahelian belt and the Horn of Africa. Not only is there
relative scarcity of water resources, but these locations also
face high evaporation rates, high levels of anticipated future
demands, and the transboundary problems associated with water
resources. Measured against the future requirements of urban centres,
agriculture, and industry, access to adequate quantity and quality
of water will soon become problematic in those areas of West Asia,
Africa, and the parts of Latin America that have mega-cities.
In some cases, competition for water may lead to conflicts over
transboundary resources.
<P>
In other regions, overexploitation of surface waters disrupts
flow regimes, affecting aquatic ecosystems and the quantity and
quality of water supplies downstream, a situation that
can lead to hostility between water users. Overexploitation of
ground water lowers water tables, which may damage wetlands,
cause ground subsidence, and induce salt-water intrusion in coastal
aquifers.
<P>
Many cities world-wide that depend on ground water as the primary
water supply are experiencing problems caused by the deterioration
of these reserves. In large cities in many regions, the discharge
of inadequately treated sewage subjects aquatic communities to
severe deoxygenation and possibly ammonia toxicity. Humans risk
microbial infection if recycled water is not adequately treated,
as happens in areas marginal to cities, including those mega-cities
in the less developed parts of Asia and Latin America.
<P>
Europe also suffers from contamination of much-needed ground-water
resources as well as shared surface water resources as a result
of excessive agricultural fertilizer and pesticide use. Concerns
over water in North America relate mainly to municipal supplies
and rural water quality and their consequent impact on health.
<P>
<A NAME="mar"></A><STRONG>Marine and Coastal Environments</STRONG>
<P>
A high proportion of the world's population resides
in coastal areas, and many more derive benefit from marine resources
such as food, employment, or tradable commodities. Marine coastal
ecosystems and the accompanying biodiversity are particularly
vulnerable to land-based sources of contamination.
<P>
An estimated one third of the world's coastal regions are at high
risk of degradation, with the greatest threat apparent in Europe.
Asia and the Pacific, the wider Caribbean, and West Asia also
face problems related to land-based sources of urban waste discharge
and industrial pollution. Shipping traffic and oil spills represent
a particular threat in West Asia and the Caribbean. Threats to
the coastal and marine resources in Latin America and the Caribbean
rise considerably with tourism, infrastructure development, and
the discharge of sediment, waste, and industrial contaminants.
Coastal erosion is a growing problem in a number of African countries
where local communities are adversely affected by changing sedimentation
patterns due to upstream dam construction or increased erosion
in degraded catchments. Eutrophication in the Baltic, Black, and
North seas is also a  problem-and a severe one in localities bordering
the Mediterranean and Caspian seas.
<P>
The overexploitation of marine fisheries and the economic impact
of such practices cause widespread concern in parts of Asia and
the Pacific, North America, Europe, and West Asia. In addition,
small island states and coastal communities of South-East Asia,
the Pacific, the Caribbean, and low-lying areas of Europe have
special concerns over the future impacts of climate change on
sea level, especially as the precise local effects cannot yet
be determined. Climate change may also affect ocean mixing and
circulation patterns, with significant repercussions on the productivity
of marine ecosystems and the location of fisheries.
<P>
<A NAME="atm"></A><STRONG>Atmosphere</STRONG>
<P>
Polluted air has many adverse impacts: on human health,
through inhalation of harmful gases and particulates; by damaging
biotic and ecosystem functions; through accelerated deterioration
of building materials; and by inducing climatic disturbances.
In the short term, it is the human health risks, especially chronic
respiratory illnesses, that are of greatest concern.
<P>
Damage to ecosystems through acidification and acid rain is also
causing growing anxiety in some regions. Once regarded only as
a problem in Europe and parts of North America, airborne pollution
has become apparent in parts of Asia and the Pacific and in Latin
America-fuelled literally by the by-products of industrialization.
The cause lies largely in the burning of fossil fuels for industry
and transport in countries with developed and rapidly growing
market economies. The long-range transportation and
transboundary effects of such atmospheric processes are increasingly
of global concern.
<P>
The concentration of people and activities close to urban and
industrial areas is of particular concern in Europe-especially
in eastern Europe, where poor air quality is considered the most
common environmental problem. Large cities in Asia and the Pacific,
Latin America, and North America also experience problems of local
air pollution. The rapid growth of a number of African cities
points to emerging problems of poor urban air quality there in
the near future.
<P>
The Montreal Protocol clearly illustrated the ability of the international
community to quickly mobilize and respond to a scientifically
identified environmental problem stemming from ozone depleting
substances. Despite coordinated action world-wide, damage to the
ozone layer continues faster than expected. The resulting increase
of ultraviolet-B radiation in the lower atmosphere has adverse
impacts on human health (skin cancer, cataracts, and reduced immune
efficiency), on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (reduced species
survival and productivity), and on building materials (faster
deterioration). While ozone depletion continues in the upper atmosphere,
rising ozone concentrations in the troposphere have focused world
attention on the extent of the human contribution to this problem.
<P>
Global warming is yet another universal problem emanating from
a changing atmosphere. All regions express concern over global
warming and place emphasis on the need for adaptive mechanisms
to cope with accompanying climate variability and sea level change.
<P>
<A NAME="urb"></A><STRONG>Urban and Industrial Environments</STRONG>
<P>
Developing and rapidly industrializing regions,
faced with rapidly increasing populations as a result of high
birth rates and in-migration, are battling with the accompanying
environmental problems of unplanned urban growth and emerging
mega-cities (those with more than 10 million inhabitants). Estimates
indicate that by the year 2000, cities will fall in
this category. The rise of such cities in Asia and the Pacific,
Latin America, and Africa has been accompanied by the proliferation
of slums and squatter settlements without access to basic infrastructure,
water, or sanitation. Eastern Europe is also affected to some
degree by this phenomenon, as are a number of cities in West Asia,
especially those experiencing massive rural-to-urban
migration.
<P>
The resultant concentration of people and of industrial and domestic
effluents and waste impose unwieldy demands on urban environments.
Poor urban and solid waste management in African cities is particularly
problematic in view of the potentially damaging effects on human
health.	 At the same time, there is a move in western Europe and
North America toward greening cities and encouraging reduced urban
population densities. The increasing number of single-person households
in these latter regions, however, is placing increased demands
on energy resources and the management of wastes.
<P>
Wherever management and disposal of industrial and domestic waste
is inadequate, these sources of soil and water contamination pose
potential hazards to human and ecosystem health. Consequently,
 improved waste management is a priority in urban and industrial
areas of Europe. Changing consumption patterns and recycling are
encouraged by governments, but thousands of contaminated sites
remain due to improper waste disposal, particularly in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.
<P>
Investment in new technologies is helping improve waste management
in much of western Europe. In the Asia-Pacific region, rapidly
growing economic activity and populations have stimulated solid
and industrial waste generation to the extent that it now poses
a serious environmental health problem.
<P>
In the industrializing countries of Latin America, industrial
effluent and solid wastes pose increasing hazards to human health
because of the close proximity of large populations to the contaminants.
Waste management receives serious attention throughout North America
due to the ever increasing quantities of municipal and industrial
waste generated. The region is the leading producer of waste on
the planet.
<P>
Chemical pollutants are emerging world-wide as a pervasive environmental
concern of highest priority. Environmental emergencies involving
chemicals appear to be steadily increasing, and mounting evidence
is being put forth about serious health risks posed by persistent
organic pollutants. Radioactive pollution remains a top environmental
concern of countries in northern and eastern Europe, particularly
those of the former Soviet Union.
<P>
<A NAME="pol"></A><STRONG>Polar Environments</STRONG>
<P>
The Arctic and Antarctic regions represent the world's
largest remaining natural areas and pristine environments. Polar
regions have long been recognized as important indicators of the
planet's overall health, especially with regard to global warming,
long-range transport of pollutants, and, in the case of Antarctica,
atmospheric ozone concentrations. For these reasons, universal
concern generated international action regarding the state of
the environment in both regions.
<P>
In the Arctic, overexploitation of fisheries, mining, the presence
of forest industries, and infrastructure development all threaten
natural habitats and open the possibility for direct degradation
and pollution of resources. A fragile ecosystem, the region is
particularly sensitive to land degradation and erosion. Biodiversity
is also fragile, with few but highly specialized and adapted species.
<P>
Military and industrial interest in the Arctic has had a negative
impact through dumping of radioactive wastes and accidents involving
similar materials. While radioactivity of Arctic seas is low compared
with other north European seas, it is still considered one of
the main threats to the Arctic environment. Traditional societies
have also increased their exploitation of resources through a
shift towards non-traditional activities.
<P>
The vast extent of Antarctica's sea ice and continental ice sheet
are especially important with regard to the modelling and assessment
of climate change and sea level rise. Its unique geographical
location and pristine environment also enable the monitoring of
air pollution against a background of minimum interference and
high sensitivity to change.  Antarctica has unique marine and
terrestrial life forms that require protection from growing international
interest in the continent. Related tourism is a growing industry
that can have a serious impact if not controlled.<P>
