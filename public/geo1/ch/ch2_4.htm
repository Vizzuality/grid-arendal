Environmental deterioration in Africa is intricately
linked to poor economic performance and poverty. The chain of
dependencies is all too familiar: rapid population growth and
poverty accelerate deforestation and the expansion of agriculture
into marginal areas, leading in turn to land  degradation, which
exacerbates food insecurity, loss of biodiversity, decline in
water quality, and decrease in health status (UNEP, 1995).
<P>
Taken in isolation, any one link in the chain is neither entirely
irrational nor perverse. Large families, for example, ensure an
adequate labour force to cope with increasing time costs for gathering
fuel and water, clearing of new land, or moving herds farther
afield in the dry season (World Bank, 1995). Clearing a patch
of forest and selling the timber to buy improved agricultural
technology may be the most sustainable form of conversion in that
situation.
<P>
The largest unknowns in the equations of environmental degradation
are not the states and magnitudes but the relative importance
of the driving forces and what actually drives what. Such knowledge
would allow progress beyond the usual truisms and tautologies-for
example, that economic development is a key to protecting and
improving the environment and that growth must be environmentally
sustainable to achieve the necessary economic development.
<P>
<A NAME="soc"></A><B>Social</B>
<P>
The population of Africa is approaching 700 million
(UNFPA, 1994). The current annual average growth rate is about
2.9 per cent and nearly half the population is below 16 years
of age, yielding a population doubling time of 20-30 years. At
this rate, the regional population will exceed 1 billion by 2005
(World Bank, 1995).
<P>
The African Common Position on Environment and Development (UNECA,
1992) states that the regional problem is not so much the high
population growth rate but its distribution: a number of countries
in Africa are underpopulated, and their resources are underexploited.
Nevertheless, rapid population growth may frustrate Government
efforts at meeting future demands for services and jobs, and slowing
it will not necessarily minimize or eliminate existing levels
of poverty, unemployment, and unevenness in income distribution
(UNECA, 1993a).
<P>
While there is admittedly no evidence to show that reducing the
population growth rate would solve poverty problems and regenerate
abused environments, failure to do so will certainly worsen the
situation. A precautionary principle seems to be emerging, and
the consensus is that socio-economic development and population
programmes should be planned and implemented simultaneously to
ensure that the benefits of each are fully realized (UNECA, 1993a).
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa is home to an estimated 35 million international
migrants, including some 4 million refugees. Out-migration from
the inland countries of the Sudano-Sahelian belt to the coastal
countries in West and Central Africa has been considerable. In
West Africa, for example, the coastal countries are thought to
have absorbed about 8 million people in the last three decades.
These trends are likely to continue and even to expand (World
Bank, 1995).
<P>
In several countries, migrants
are not only pulled towards cities by the prospect of jobs and
higher incomes, they are also pushed out of rural areas by such
factors as poverty, lack of land, declining returns from agricultural
commodities, war, and famine. Migration is also often part of
a complex household survival strategy, in which families minimize
risk by placing family members in different labour markets. An
estimated 40-60 per cent of the annual urban population growth
in developing countries is due to rural-urban migration, particularly
where rural poverty is rampant (WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB, 1996; SARDC,
personal communication, 1996).
<P>
Africa still needs to improve in the areas of education and health.
Since the promise of the 1990 Jomtien Conference on Education
for All, slow but steady progress is being made in most regions
of the world. In Africa, however, the downward trend in educational
enrollment of the 1980s has not been reversed (UNDP, 1996). Repetition
rates are excessive, retention is poor, and the gender gap is
high. The health situation in Africa is cause for some satisfaction,
in that life spans have increased significantly, in part from
the impacts of concerted health initiatives. Yet it remains a
cause of outrage in that preventable deaths, suffering, and loss
of human potential are still high (UNDP, 1996).
<P>
Conflict arising from political instability has been a primary
impediment to development in a number of African countries. The
social, economic, and environmental impacts can be immense, as
demonstrated in the recent armed conflicts that resulted in massive
displacements and loss of human life. The causes for these outbreaks
have been largely internal to the countries in question.
Although such conflicts may be more amenable to intervention and
management before they lead to violence, they also have wider
implications: violence spillover, refugee flows, and regional
destabilization. For example, the influx of Mozambican refugees
into Malawi had a catastrophic effect on land and forest
resources (Babu and Hassan, 1995). Some conflicts and social unrest
were the result not only of  political instability but also of
ethnic tensions, food insecurity, poverty, limited access to resources,
and land pressures.
<P>
<A NAME="eco"></A><B>Economic</B>
<P>
Of the 30 poorest countries of the world, 21 are in
Africa (World Bank, 1995). The United Nations Economic Commission
for Africa points to the scarcity of a financial capital base
for the initiation, stimulation, promotion, and sustenance of
development activities as being the root of underdevelopment and
environmental degradation in Africa (UNECA, 1992). Availability
and suitability of imported technology to local situations is
also a problem (SARDC, personal communication, 1996).
<P>
Lack of or slow growth, particularly in central and northern Africa,
has contributed significantly to the overall low aggregate regional
output. The annual average growth rate from 1990 to 1993 was a
mere 1.5 per cent, barely half of the regional population growth
rate (UNECA, 1993b). Western Africa did better (2.7 per cent),
while central Africa stagnated (UNECA, 1993b). In the last few
years, however, nearly half the countries have diverged from the
general trend, reaching rates between 3 and 8 per cent, with three
of them exceeding even the 8 per cent level (UNDP, 1996).
<P>
Poor people are most at risk from environmental damage, whatever
the cause. In economies based on natural resources, which most
African countries are, resource degradation reduces the productivity
of the poor, increases their susceptibility to extreme weather,
economic and civil events, and environmental health threats. Poverty
also makes recovery from such events even more difficult. Extreme
events, especially those related to weather, appear to be increasing
in frequency in Africa (World Bank, 1995).
<P>
Most African countries depend on primary commodities for a significant
part of their export income. Yet the values of the continent's
agricultural and mineral raw material exports have been falling
dramatically from the combined effects of stagnation in industrial
countries, substitution by synthetics, and competition from, for
example, the Commonwealth of Independent States (UNECA, 1993b).
<P>
Africa's external debt continues to be a major
impediment to the achievement of accelerated economic growth and
development. The total debt stock stood at US$313 billion in 1994,
equivalent to 234 per cent of export income and 83 per cent of
GDP. The debt burden was higher than that of any other region.
Four fifths of severely indebted low-income countries (as designated
by the World Bank) are in sub-Saharan Africa, and the number is
increasing. In sub-Saharan Africa, the average per capita debt
servicing load was US$43, compared with US$35 spent on health
and education. Nineteen African countries have manageable debt
burdens, but even under the most optimistic assumptions, 24 countries
will continue to face an unsustainable debt burden (by World Bank
criteria) well into the twenty-first century.
<P>
There are also problems of high dependence on foreign aid and
marginalization in the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI).
African development has had very heavy involvement by donors,
who in some cases have provided the full funding for long-term
development investment activities (UNDP, 1996). But donor-driven
development has not always been co-ordinated or fully appreciative
of Africa's development efforts and priorities. While FDI increased
to Latin America and Asia, Africa's share of FDI remains at less
than 2 per cent of total flows (UNDP, 1996). A study by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development concluded that, contrary
to common perceptions, FDI in Africa can be profitable and at
a level above the average in other developing regions (UNDP, 1996).
<P>
In the face of declining export earnings and debt burdens, many
Governments have tried to boost their cash crop production and
timber sales. This has led to further environmental damage as
well as forced poor farmers to move further onto marginal lands
(UNECA, 1993a). Many of the institutions and infrastructure supporting
agriculture often operate inadequately, with little impact on
food supply and a lack of support for agricultural technologies
(UNECA, 1993a).
<P>
Thirty-five African countries have been implementing structural
adjustment programmes for more than a decade, and have put in
place economic reform measures in an attempt to correct some fundamental
economic imbalances and to support private-sector development.
Although African Governments are committed to removing obstacles
to growth, current projections indicate that socio-economic recovery
is still not in sight for most countries (UNDP, 1996). It has
also been argued that structural adjustment programmes have been
leading to wider gaps between rich and poor (Ohlsson, 1995).
<P>
<A NAME="ins"></A><B>Institutional</B>
<P>
Political liberalization is spreading across Africa
(UNDP, 1996); pluralism and accountability are more evident. In
the last five years, 30 sub-Saharan countries held national  pluralistic
elections. In the wake of such changes, civil society is growing
in strength, with significant movements towards more open communication,
a freer press, decentralization, attention to human rights, social
justice, and popular participation in the development process;
evidence of this includes the fuller inclusion of women in positions
of economic and political prominence (UNDP, 1996). Grassroots
participation and initiatives are playing an increasingly important
role in the process of policy-making and implementation (UNEP,
1996b).
<P>
Yet institutional infrastructures to support democratic changes
often lag behind. Physical as well as institutional infrastructures
were designed to support the colonial economy, not to promote
production diversity and industrial development in general. Given
a long history of dependence on imported technological inputs,
African countries have only relatively recently begun to be involved
in acquiring appropriate technological capability (UNECA, 1993a),
thereby increasing both local capacity and competitiveness.
<P>
Financial institutions, too, need attention. In many African countries,
the banking system is weak and in some cases bankrupt (UNDP, 1996).
There is dominance of State-owned banks, with Government control
of credit markets and interest rates. In many countries, Government
expenditures outstrip revenues: 30 countries have fiscal deficits
of nearly 10 per cent of GDP, draining savings from the rest of
the economy (UNDP, 1996).
<P>
A number of Governments, centres of commerce and learning,
non-governmental groups, and private and public donors, including
United Nations agencies, are actively working to expand the information
and telecommunication infrastructures in Africa, so that Africans
can become full actors in the global information revolution. As
the rest of the world also adapts to this, the resistance of African
central Government and parastatal institutions to communications
entrepreneurship is fading, thereby creating opportunities
for information exchange rather than information hoarding and
exploitation. The ensuing participation by a wide range of community
sectors offers great opportunities for Africa to compete effectively
in an international marketplace and thereby bolster and accelerate
development.
<P>
<A NAME="env"></A><B>Environmental</B>
<P>
Some underlying natural environmental factors in Africa
reinforce the effects of the human-driven causes of environmental
degradation. One major factor that affects the continent is the
climate, which is generally dry with frequent severe droughts
and highly variable rainfall. Droughts and the great unevenness
in the distribution of natural resources (such as water and vegetation)
are the predominant impediments to development and are intrinsic
to environmental degradation. It is clear that Africa is endowed
with diverse and rich natural resources; the greatest problem
lies in the imbalance in the use of these resources as a result
of a combination of factors discussed already. These include a
lack of investment capital, inappropriate technologies, and poor
management.
<P>
Little can be done about the natural climate variability save
discovering, teaching, instilling, and encouraging behavioural
changes to adapt to prevailing conditions. Global climate change
could disrupt the weather patterns and contribute to the worsening
of the natural climatic conditions. The potential impact of climate
change is a concern in Africa.
<P>
The poor quality of soils is another constraining environmental
factor. In addition to the climatic conditions, phosphorus deficiency,
low content of organic matter, and low water infiltration and
retention capacity on much of the African soils have been a limiting
factor in agriculture. Unlike climate variability, however, this
problem can be addressed: soil quality can be augmented through
considerable investment in careful management and importation
of nutrients.
<P>
Natural disasters other than droughts that have negative impacts
on the environment and the sustainability of economic growth include
invasion by desert locusts, storms, and floods. Although the need
is global, in Africa there is a particular sense of urgency about
understanding the causal links and the relationships between the
various driving forces behind environmental problems in order
to help formulate policies that will work.
