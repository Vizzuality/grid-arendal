<P>
The two countries considered in this section, Canada
and the United States, rank among the wealthiest in the world,
not only in per capita income but also in richness of natural
resources. With its high standard of living, North America is
the leading producer and consumer of goods and services-and of
waste-on the planet. Both nations are concerned about global,
regional, and national implications of today s resource use patterns,
with the increasingly obvious negative feedback on the quality
of life.
<P>
In both countries, major Government
policy statements are made to bring environmental issues to public
attention (Marchi, 1996; Christopher, 1996). Some
of the priority environmental concerns in the region have also
been expressed by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation
(CEC), set up in 1994 under the environmental side agreement
of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which includes
Mexico. The CEC concentrates on five areas: environmental conservation;
protecting human health and the environment; environment, trade,
and economy; enforcement co-operation and environmental law; and
information and public outreach (CEC, 1996).
<P>
This section draws on official reports and statements of the Canadian
and U.S. Governments as well as reports from Government agencies
and the private, non-governmental sector, including public opinion
surveys.
<P>
Together, Canada and the U.S. cover nearly
18.8 million square kilometres, some 14 per cent of the world
s land area. The two countries contribute 49 per cent and 51 per
cent to this total area respectively. With one of the longest
common borders in the world, transboundary, multimedia environmental
issues are also important. Environmental deterioration in the
Great Lakes Basin and trans-boundary air pollution are two such
areas of concern.
<P>
<A NAME="lan"></A><B>Land</B>
<P>
The major land-related problems in the region
are erosion; soil contamination resulting from industrial and
agricultural activities, including the overuse of fertilizer and
pesticide use; and water contamination from agricultural practices.
<P>
Canada depends on the land for its
economic well-being more than most other industrialized nations.
One in three workers is employed directly or indirectly in agriculture,
forestry, mining, energy generation, and other land-based activities
(Government of Canada, 1996). In the United States, while dependence
on primary production is lower, agricultural production and marketing
account for 16 per cent of employment, and almost half of the
total land area (excluding Alaska) is dedicated to agriculturally
related purposes (PCSD, 1996).
<P>
U.S. agriculture is in transition. While total
cropland has stayed nearly constant since 1945 at 186 million
hectares, much of the best farmland is adjacent to major metropolitan
areas and is being converted to non-agricultural uses (PCSD, 1996;
USDA, 1996). The number of farms declined by almost 31 per cent,
from 2.9 million in 1970 to 2 million in 1994, as the average
size of farms increased by about 28 per cent in the same period
(PCSD, 1996). New strategies are needed to address the changing
situation.
<P>
Throughout North America, then, the management of farms
and rangeland is a key part of sustainable development. Poor agricultural
practices result in hazards to human health. Although the pesticide
DDT has been banned in Canada and the United States,
residues of DDT, such as DDE, are still found in the serum and
fat tissues of the majority of North Americans due to its persistence
in the environment and to continued inputs from other regions
through long-range transport. High DDE levels in women
have been associated with an increased risk of
breast cancer. The presence of other chlorinated compounds in
human tissues has raised concerns about their possible harmful
effects on endocrine and reproductive functions (Pohl and Chivian,
1996; Canadian Dept. of Foreign Affairs and International Trade,
1996b).
<P>
Some measures are being taken to address key problems. For example,
by 1992, U.S. farmers had reduced soil erosion on croplands by
around one billion metric tons per year from 1982 levels (NSTC,
1996).Soil erosion savings have come about through
the Conservation Reserve Program (635 million metric tons), conservation
technical assistance (272 million metric tons), and conservation
compliance (90 million metric tons) (PCSD, 1996).
<P>
To mitigate the use of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), Canada
and the U.S. have developed and implemented pesticide management
programmes nationally and regionally.
<P>
<A NAME="for"></A><B>Forests</B>
<P>
Forests are a dominant feature of the North
American landscape, covering almost half of Canada (Natural
Resources Canada, 1996) and a third of the United States (Brooks,
1993). They provide a great diversity of economic, ecological,
recreational, cultural, and spiritual benefits. These two countries
are the world s two leading exporters of forest products (Brooks,
1993). In Canada alone, more than 880,000 people rely on the forest
industry for their livelihood (Canadian Dept. of Foreign Affairs
and International Trade, 1996b). Important steps-including both
public and private action-have been taken to put the region on
an effective course for achieving sustainable forestry management
(PCSD, 1996; Natural Resources Canada, 1996).
<P>
Pressures for commercial logging are expected to intensify in
the U.S. in the years to come. In Canada, commercial logging is
not expected to increase, and annual harvests are currently running
at almost a quarter below the annual allowable cut (Canadian Dept.
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 1996b). While deforestation
and loss of forested area are not among the priority concerns,
the depletion of old-growth forests and of the last remaining
rainforests in British Columbia, Canada, and the Pacific Northwest
in the United States are serious concerns of the public and often
trigger discussions and legal measures for their conservation.
Recently there has been a movement to stop logging of old-growth
forests on public lands in order to promote biodiversity conservation.
<P>
Although most forests in the United States are managed for multiple
use, private forests are often managed with a stronger emphasis
on fibre production than is found in public forestlands. Private
forests also produce higher wood yields at a lower cost per unit
than public timberlands. Because of these factors, private forest
areas figure significantly in market-based approaches to promoting
natural resources stewardship (PCSD, 1996). There are nearly 8
million private landowners engaged in non-industrial forestry
in the United States. Together they planted 41 per cent of the
trees planted in 1993 and care for 59 per cent of U.S. timberland
(Comanor, 1994).
<P>
In Canada, although more than 425,000 landowners are engaged in
private forestry, only 6 per cent of the nation s forests are
growing on private property. Provincial governments
are responsible for managing 71 per cent of Canadian forests;
the remaining 23 per cent are managed by Federal and Territorial
governments (Natural Resources Canada, 1996).
<P>
<A NAME="bio"></A><B>Biodiversity</B>
<P>
<A NAME="fig2_20"></A>Canada s wildlife heritage is estimated to encompass
138,000 species, including 4,000 vascular plants, 1,800 vertebrates,
and more than 44,000 invertebrates (Environment Canada, 1996b).
As of 1996, 254 species, subspecies, or populations in Canada
were considered endangered, threatened, or vulnerable; another
21 species were already nationally or globally extinct (Government
of Canada, 1996b). (See <A HREF="../fig/fig2_20.htm"> Figure 2.20.</A>) Pressures on native wildlife
are also reflected in the presence of toxic contaminants in tissues
of living organisms and in the ongoing invasions of non-native
species, such as the purple loosestrife and the zebra mussel.
Encouraging signs include an increase in populations of ducks
and some species of geese; progress in efforts to restore endangered
species such as the peregrine falcon, swift fox, and whooping
crane; and declining levels of toxins in tissues of living
organisms (Government of Canada, 1996).
<P>
There are about 2,800 protected areas in Canada, excluding
private lands and cultural heritage sites. Nearly two thirds of
their total area is strictly protected, but most sites are smaller
than 10 square kilometres. Of the 217 terrestrial eco-regions
in Canada, 71 have no protected sites (Government of Canada, 1996).
Preliminary modelling has suggested that 7 per cent of
Canada is at high risk of biodiversity loss, and only 25 per cent
is at low risk (Environment Canada, 1996a). In an effort to protect
biodiversity, Canada continues to add to its networks of parks
and other protected areas, as well as to legislation (Government
of Canada, 1996).
<P>
The United States has also made strides in the protection
of its natural resources. By 1994, for example, 5.7 million hectares
across the country were protected through land trusts. Private
and voluntary efforts have resulted in a 49-percent
increase in the area under conservation since 1990. While public
lands play an important role in this respect, private lands are
also critical because they account for 64 per cent of the continental
United States. Moreover, of the 728 species listed as
endangered or threatened (under the Endangered Species Act), about
half are found on a combination of public and private lands. To
date, existing laws and regulations have not been entirely adequate
to safeguard the nation s biological diversity (PCSD, 1996).
<P>
<A NAME="wat"></A><B>Water</B>
<P>
Water is one of the most common concerns
of Americans and Canadians. Despite an overall relative abundance,
water shortages occur periodically in some localities, such as
the more arid sections of the western United States, the Canadian
prairie, and some of the valleys in the interior of British Columbia.
<P>
<A NAME="tab2_10"></A><A NAME="tab2_11"></A>Canadians and Americans are among the world s largest per capita
consumers of water (See <A HREF="../tab/tab2_10.htm"> Table 2.10.</A>) especially where prices are
relatively low. For example, Canadian households use twice as
much water as European households, but they pay half as much for
it. (See <A HREF="../tab/tab2_11.htm"> Table 2.11.</A>) In 1994, Canadian households that paid volume-based
water rates used 258 litres per person per day, nearly 40 per
cent less than those charged a flat rate (Environment Canada,
1996d).
<P>
Eleven per cent of all surface and ground water withdrawn in Canada
is used for municipal purposes. While one in four Canadians relies
on ground water for domestic supply and the remainder depend on
surface water, both sources are coming increasingly under threat
in terms of quantity and quality (Environment Canada, 1996d).
Because of increasing demand, municipal water supply is becoming
one of the most critical water issues in the region (Environment
Canada, 1996d; EOP, 1993). For example, in 1991, one in five Canadian
municipalities reported problems with water availability (Environment
Canada, 1996d). Linked to this is a growing concern for how to
prevent resource depletion and reduce the environmental burden
caused by the use of water for both industrial and community needs.
<P>
Compared with most other countries, Canada and the United States
enjoy relatively good water quality. Nevertheless, basic delivery
problems remain in some rural areas. Improper agricultural production
practices have in some areas contributed significantly to impaired
water quality of rivers, lakes, and estuaries (PCSD, 1996). In
Canada, recent surveys suggest that 20 to 40 per cent of rural
wells may be affected by faecal coliform bacteria (Government
of Canada, 1996). A U.S. Department of Agriculture study in 1995
concluded that 2.4 million rural Americans, including a million
without piped water, had a critical need for safe, dependable
drinking water; supplies to a further 5.6 million did not meet
Safe Drinking Water requirements (EPA, 1996a). The cost of meeting
&quot;highest priority&quot; safe drinking water needs in rural
America was estimated at US$3.5 billion.
<P>
One in five U.S. citizens receives water from a facility that
violates a national safety standard. Surface water treatment standards
were not met in 9 per cent of the systems while total coliform
bacteria levels exceeded permitted levels in 8 per cent of the
systems. Lead and copper treatment violations occurred in 1 per
cent, as did chemical or radiological contamination violations.
Through aggressive action under the Surface Water Treatment Rule
by responsible authorities, the risk of human exposure to microbiological
contaminants is being reduced. In 1993, 1,000 water systems serving
12 million residents were not in compliance; by 1995, the number
of non-compliant systems had been reduced to 400, serving 9.9
million (EPA, 1996a). Since 1972, the United States has invested
a total of US$350 billion to control water pollution (NSTC, 1996).
<P>
Most Canadians get their drinking water from municipal water supplies,
which generally meet high provincial and territorial safety standards.
However, a 1995 report entitled &quot;Community Drinking Water
and Sewage Treatment in First Nation Communities&quot; indicates
that in those Aboriginal communities, about 20 per cent of the
water systems require action to eliminate the risk of potential
health problems while 9 per cent of the sewage systems have problems
that could put human health at risk (Canadian Dept. of Foreign
Affairs and International Trade, 1996).
<P>
The largest system of fresh surface water on earth,
containing approximately 18 per cent of the world supply, is
situated on the Canada-U.S. border. The Great Lakes-Superior,
Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario-together with the St.
Lawrence River system, are a vital part of the physical and cultural
heritage of North America. Spanning more than 1,200 kilometres
from east to west, these inland fresh-water seas provide water
for consumption, transportation, power, and recreation. The
basin ecosystem is home to more than one tenth of the population
of the U.S. and one quarter of the population of Canada. Some
of the world s largest concentrations of industrial capacity are
located in the Great Lakes region. Nearly 25 per cent of the total
Canadian agricultural production and 7 per cent of the American
production are located in the basin (Environment Canada and U.S.-EPA,
1995).
<P>
Beginning in the 1950s, concerns arose about the increasing eutrophication
of the lakes, loss of wetlands and other habitats, the impact
of exotic species on native fish stocks and aquatic ecosystems,
and environmental contamination by persistent toxic chemicals.
Concerted, system-wide efforts by both governments over the intervening
years have done a great deal to restore environmental quality.
Nutrient stresses are no longer the widespread problem that they
were in the 1970s. There has been a general decline in the concentrations
of persistent organic substances in all media throughout the Great
Lakes. The aquatic community in Lake Superior is in good health
again.
<P>
Despite these and other improvements, the
latest <I>State of the Great Lakes</I> report, issued
by the governments of Canada and the U.S. (Environment Canada
and U.S.-EPA, 1995), concludes that the health of the Great Lakes
Basin ecosystem is still variable. For instance, many
toxic contaminant loadings remain above acceptable levels in water,
aquatic organisms, and fish-eating birds. Aquatic habitats and
wetlands are considered to be in a generally poor state due to
huge losses acquired over the years in both quality and quantity.The
ecosystem balance and reproductive impairment of native species
in Lakes Michigan, Ontario, and eastern Erie are still worrying.
Joint efforts are continuing to address, in an integrated manner,
the Great Lakes environment. (See <A HREF="ch3_26.htm"> Chapter 3.</A>)
<P>
<A NAME="mar"></A><B>Marine and Coastal Environments</B>
<P>
<A NAME="fig2_21"></A>By the year 2000, more than three quarters of the U.S.
population is expected to reside in coastal communities, with
concomitant effects on land use (PCSD, 1996). The figure is much
lower in Canada, about 25 per cent. Canada has the longest coastline
in the world, fronting on three oceans (Government of Canada,
1996).	Not surprisingly, the sustainable use of marine ecosystems
is thus crucial to the future of both nations. (See <A HREF="../fig/fig2_21.htm"> Figure 2.21.</A>)
<P>
The populations of some estuarine, inshore, and offshore
fisheries have been reduced to drastically low levels in North
America by overfishing, loss of habitat, and land-based pollution.
From 1980 to 1989, reports from more than 3,650 events with disastrous
impacts on fish populations cited the loss of 407 million fish
in coastal and near-coastal locations in the United States (EOP,
1993; EPA, 1996a). In eastern Canada, acid rain is responsible
for habitat degradation and the loss of fish in thousands of lakes
and rivers, including a number of former salmon streams (EPA,
1996a). Pollution has also caused the disappearance of some formerly
fished species and the decline of some others in the Great Lakes-St.
Lawrence River system (EPA, 1996a).
<P>
Approximately 1,000 species of fish
live in Canadian waters; fewer than 200 live in fresh
water, the others live in salt water along the Atlantic, Arctic,
and Pacific coasts. Four stocks or species are thought to be extinct,
two are no longer found in Canadian waters, and 49 are listed
as endangered, threatened, or vulnerable. Declining fish stocks
have resulted in the collapse of the East Coast fisheries, with
a devastating impact in eastern Canada (Environment Canada, 1996c).
<P>
<A NAME="atm"></A><B>Atmosphere</B>
<P>
Concentrations of some atmospheric pollutants have been
noticeably reduced in North America. Over the period 1970 to 1993,
among the six pollutants used to monitor National Ambient Air
Quality in the U.S., lead showed the most dramatic improvement,
with virtual outdoor elimination since the 1970s following the
changeover to unleaded fuel (Government of the United States of
America, 1995). Emissions of four of the other five critical pollutants
also declined: carbon monoxide (by 24 per cent), volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) (by 24 per cent), fine particulate matter (PM-10)
(by 78 per cent), and sulphur dioxide (by 30 per cent). Only nitrogen
oxide registered an increase (of 14 per cent) (Government of the
United States of America, 1995). Although nitrogen oxide emissions
from vehicles have declined during the last 10 years, these gains
have been offset to a large extent by increased fuel combustion
for electricity generation.
<P>
In Canada, industrial emissions of sulphur dioxide
were cut by nearly half while emissions of total particulate matter
from industrial plants declined by nearly 36 per cent between
1970 and 1985 (Environment Canada, 1996d). As in the United
States, ambient concentrations of lead have dropped
dramatically and, by the early 1990s, were only a small percentage
of the concentrations present 20 years earlier (Environment Canada,
n.d.).
<P>
Despite these improvements, air pollution
is still a concern in both countries. Twenty years after the passage
of the Clean Air Act in the United States, one in three Americans
still lives in an area where the air is too polluted to meet Federal
health standards (Browner, 1996). The major air quality issues
in the United States have been identified as health risks from
air pollutants in the ambient air, especially ozone and toxic
chemicals; ecosystem damage from regional air pollution, including
ozone and acid deposition; transboundary air pollution; and radon
and other indoor air pollutants (US-UNCED, 1992).
<P>
Some central Canadian cities continue to experience unacceptable
air quality, especially in summer. The most frequent
causes are ground-level ozone and airborne particulates (Environment
Canada, 1996d). Canadian and U.S. emissions of ozone-forming volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides, the precursors of
ground-level ozone, are still close to the levels of the
mid-1980s (Government of Canada, 1996). Pulmonary disease from
air pollution, especially from small particulates, has been estimated
to cause 50,000-60,000 deaths each year in the United States and
to cost the economy a total of US$40 billion to US$50 billion
in direct health care expenditures and lost productivity (Pohl
and Chivian, 1996). Some experts have suggested that 6 per cent
of all respiratory admissions to hospitals in Canada are smog-related
(Marchi, 1996).
<P>
In recent years, comparative risk
studies performed by EPA have consistently ranked indoor air pollution
among the five top environmental risks to public health in the
U.S.  Studies of human exposure to air pollution indicate that
indoor air levels of many pollutants may be two to five times-and,
on some occasions, more than 100 times-higher than outdoor levels
(EPA, 1994). Over the past several decades, exposure to indoor
air pollutants is believed to have increased due to a variety
of factors, including the construction of more tightly sealed
buildings, reduced ventilation rates to save energy, the use of
synthetic building materials and furnishings, and the use of chemically
formulated personal care products, pesticides, and household cleaners.
EPA, in close cooperation with other Federal agencies and the
private sector, has begun a concerted effort to better
understand indoor air pollution and to reduce people s exposure
to air pollutants in offices, homes, schools, and so
on (EPA, 1996b).
<P>
Electricity generation accounts for about 70 per cent of annual
sulphur dioxide emissions and 30 per cent of nitrogen oxide emissions
in the United States (EPA, 1996d). The largest source of sulphur
dioxide emissions in Canada is the smelting of metal ores, which
accounts for 50 per cent of eastern Canadian emissions. Power
generation contributes 20 per cent (Environment Canada, 1996d).
<P>
Airborne acidic pollutants are often transported by large-scale
weather systems thousands of kilometres from their point of origin
before being deposited. In eastern North America, weather systems
generally travel from southwest to northeast. Thus, pollutants
emitted from sources in the industrial heartland of the midwestern
states and central Canada regularly fall on the more rural and
comparatively pristine areas of northeastern U.S. and southeastern
Canada (Environment Canada, 1996).
<P>
Acidification of surface waters is a further cause for concern.
Many lakes and streams in Canada and the United States suffer
from chronic acidity because they rest atop soil with a limited
capacity to neutralize acidic compounds (called &quot;buffering
capacity&quot;). The U.S. National Surface Water Survey found
that acid rain causes acidity in 75 per cent of acidic lakes and
about half the acidic streams (EPA, 1996d). The Canadian Government
has estimated that 14,000 lakes in eastern Canada are acidic (Government
of Canada, 1996d). About 43 per cent of Canada s land, mainly
in the east, is highly sensitive to acid rain (Environment Canada,
1996d). Acidification in Canada is, to a large extent, a transboundary
problem because half the acid rain falling in Canada originates
in the U.S. (Environment Canada, 1996). &quot;Episodic&quot; acidification
is an added concern, particularly since it can cause large &quot;fish
kills.&quot; In the United States, for example, approximately
70 per cent of sensitive lakes in the Adirondacks of New York
state and 30 per cent of streams in the mid-Appalachians of the
eastern United States are likely to become acidic during such
an episode (EPA, 1996d).
<P>
Recent extreme weather events, including heat waves
and heavy flooding, have helped citizens to understand the possible
impacts of climate change and how they could affect North America.
The region produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other
region and has among the highest per capita emission levels (WRI/UNEP/UNDP/WB,
1996). Total U.S. emissions increased by 13 per cent
between 1970 and 1990 (EOP, 1993) and currently comprise 22 per
cent of the world total (WRI/ UNEP/UNDP/WB, 1996). Both Canada
and the United States are pursuing ways to reduce their contributions
as part of concerted efforts under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change.
<P>
<A NAME="urb"></A><B>Urban and Industrial Environments</B>
<P>
Health threats to children in urban and industrial environments
are of particular concern in the region (NRC, 1993; Needleman
and Landrigan, 1994; OTA, 1990; Schewiz and Harris, 1993; Canadian
Dept. of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 1996a). Four
million one- to six-year-olds in the United States-including two
thirds of poor, minority, inner-city pre-school children-have
levels of lead in their blood high enough to cause brain damage
(Pohl and Chivian, 1996). The U.S. Public Health Service has concluded
that toxic lead exposure costs the country tens of billions of
dollars in health expenditure and productivity loss (Pohl and
Chivian, 1996). This lead is primarily from indoor pollution (e.g.,
from paint) and from mother-to-child transfer during pregnancy.
(Lead remains in the body, in bones, for example, for
a long period of time.)
<P>
The remedies adopted to upgrade
environmental quality during the past two decades have not always
benefited all communities or all populations within a community
equally. Many minority, low-income, and Native American communities
have raised concerns that they suffer a disproportionate burden
of health consequences due to the proximity to industrial plants
and waste dumps, and from exposures to pesticides or other toxic
chemicals at home and on the job. They argue that environmental
programmes do not adequately address these disproportionate exposures
or the underlying &quot;environmental justice&quot; issues (Greenwire,
1996).
<P>
Reducing overall chemical loads on North America s environment
is one of the region s major concerns. The dramatic growth in
the number and variety of chemical products since the Second World
War has led to an increasing concern for the health of both wildlife
and humans. More than 35,000 chemicals are reported to be in use
in Canada today (Environment Canada, 1996d). Just how many of
these are toxic is unclear. Today, one in four U.S. citizens lives
within four miles of a toxic waste dumpsite (EPA, 1996c). Restoration
and remediation of hundreds of thousands of contaminated ground
sites will cost the United States an estimated US$100 billion
to US$1 trillion over the next 30 years (NSTC, 1996). In 1991,
Canadians produced an estimated 5.9 million tons of industrial
hazardous wastes, most of which came from industrial sources.
It is estimated that as many as 1,000 sites in Canada are contaminated
by hazardous wastes (Government of Canada, 1991).
<P>
The United States is the largest producer of wastes in the world
(PCSD, 1996). Per capita generation of solid waste has increased
65 per cent over the last 25 years (NSTC, 1996). Some 195 million
tons of municipal waste were generated annually in 1992 and 1993;
by the year 2000, total municipal waste generation is projected
to reach 222 million tons per year (Government of the United States
of America, 1995). Throughout North America, urban centres are
having increasing problems finding sites for new sanitary landfills.
Campaigns to save resources and encourage recycling or waste separation
by local, regional, and national public institutions have already
led to the implementation of stricter rules in certain communities.
Canada is committed to a 50-per-cent waste-reduction target established
by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (Canadian
Dept. of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 1996b).
