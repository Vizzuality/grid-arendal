<h2>Summary of Regional Policy Responses</h2>
<h3>Environmental Citizenship</h3>
The past five years has witnessed the emergence of democratization
in several regions and with it, a growth in the intertwining of
politics and the environment. Many of the mechanisms required
to successfully implement sustainable development rely on accountable
partnerships between government, industry, business,
and the community at large. The value of popular participation
by both individuals and interest groups in the development of
environmental policy is increasingly being recognized by formerly
centralized governments; thus, opening the way for greater environmental
citizenship in the future.
<P>
In Africa, decentralization of government authorities offers potential
for increased grass-roots participation in policy development
and implementation in the future. Individual rights to a clean
and healthy environment are clearly acknowledged in the constitutions
of several African countries and care for the environment considered
a duty of all citizens. In specific instances, the role of NGOs
in Latin America and the Caribbean in policy development and implementation
has grown in recent years. Continued involvement of NGOs and other
responsible interest groups is important for the future of  environmental
management in the Region. The role of environmental NGOs
in West Asia in policy development and environmental management
is still minimal. Community based action programmes are evident
in a number of countries in Asia and the Pacific, with people-oriented
environmental restoration programmes and involvement of women
notable in south Asia.
<P>
Significant popular mobilization has created networks of environmental
organizations in civil society in both North America and Europe.
A plethora of environmental NGOs contributes vigorously to policy
evolution, and implementation and monitoring of programmes in
both regions. Increased participation of the private sector in
policy development and environmental management is significant.
Voluntary codes of conduct, guidelines on environmental management
and similar initiatives contribute increasingly to sound stewardship
of the environment and economic development.
<P>
Political reform in many countries has also improved access to
information for environmentalists. Additional opportunities are
growing rapidly where national telecommunications supporting the
global information highway are adequate and affordable.
