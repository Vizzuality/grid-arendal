West Asia has one of the highest rates of population
growth in the world, exceeding 3 per cent a year in most countries
during the period 1990-95; the growth rate ranges from 2 per cent
in Lebanon to 3.6 per cent in Oman (UN, 1994b). The limited arable
land of the region is suffering from intense development due to
population expansion. The human pressure on land is noticeable
in Jordan, Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Yemen. Irrigated
land is being cultivated all year round, with increasing applications
of water, fertilizer, and pesticides. At the same time, large
areas of fertile land are being taken out of production to meet
urban, transport, and industrial needs, while land of low productivity
is being overused as herds overgraze rangelands. Poorer farmers
cultivate marginal land with low rainfall without adequate fallowing
or fertilizer application. Forest products, particularly in Iraq,
Lebanon, and Yemen, are harvested at rates that exceed the annual
growth rate.
<P>
The increased population and agricultural activity have also raised
water demand in the region, as noted earlier. This has prompted
an overexploitation of ground water leading to salinization and
destruction of habitats for plants and animals.
<P>
Political instability and armed conflict in the region have led
to population movements, which introduce further pressures on
cities and countries. The refugees and returnees in the aftermath
of the Gulf War converged on the major cities of Jordan, for example,
stressing the infrastructure and leading to environmental degradation.
<P>
Other direct environmental consequences are the air pollution
arising from fires in the oil fields. In the Gulf areas, about
1.5 million barrels of oil were spilled during the conflict (ESCWA,
1991). The slow flushing process in the Persian Gulf greatly exacerbated
cleanup problems, affecting the marine and coastal environment
and the resources there.
<P>
Poverty plays a role in the region with regard to environmental
degradation, especially in the cities where the poor are crowded
in settlements on the periphery of cities with inadequate infrastructures.
<P>
<A NAME="eco"></A><B>Economic</B>
<P>
Industrial development is progressively playing a key
role in the economic development of West Asia. Highly mechanized
and intensive agricultural production aimed at high economic returns
means the use of pesticides and fertilizers that get into the
food chain and also pollute rivers and marine and coastal areas.
<P>
Oil production is by far the most important industry in the Persian
Gulf, with the economy of almost all countries being oil-based.
Oil and gas exploration, refining, petrochemicals industries,
and oil transportation all affect the environment. There are about
34 offshore oil and gas fields, and more than 800 producing offshore
wells (ESCWA, 1991). Thousands of kilometres of underwater pipelines
connect these wells to shore facilities and terminals. The hazards
to marine and coastal environments are greatest from offshore
activities, but land production of oil also poses a threat from
the disposal of oily sludges, which are often deposited near or
directly into the sea. By quantity, these sludges present the
largest solid waste problem in the Persian Gulf (ESCWA, 1991).
<P>
<A NAME="ins"></A><B>Institutional</B>
<P>
The development of policies and institutions to monitor
and protect the environment has not kept pace with economic growth
in the region. For example, most surface water comes from rivers
shared among member and non-member countries. Lack of formal agreements
for sharing the flow of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers could
create conflict in the future. This is, however, now
receiving appropriate attention at both the national and regional
level.
