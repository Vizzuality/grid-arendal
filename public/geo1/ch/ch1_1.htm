<H3>A New Era in Environmental Assessment</H3>
Against this background of major changes in the world
and the global efforts to address them, environmental assessment
is changing too. Monitoring progress towards sustainable development
and assessing the state of the environment are no longer just
static reporting activities. They involve co-operative and frequent
interactions of policy-makers and scientists working together
to achieve orderly progress towards the implementation of Agenda
21, the blueprint for action adopted in 1992 at the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro.
<P>
Assessments that aim to support sustainable development
can no longer report on the environment in isolation. Rather,
environmental issues have to be seen as parts of larger systems,
closely coupled to socio-economic developments and strongly influenced
by political and institutional structures. The current trend is
thus towards integrated analyses, including the evaluation of
alternative policy options to provide an improved knowledge base
for action, political accountability, and public participation.
<P>
Evidence of this new approach is found in the international assessments
done on ozone layer depletion, climate change, acidification,
biodiversity, land degradation, toxic wastes, and land-based sources
of pollution. These studies have supported and still support international
negotiations and decision-making. The adoption and the implementation
of major global environmental conventions in recent years have
relied on such scientific assessments, which involved hundreds
of experts, analyses of the latest information and research results,
scientific consensus, and translation of the consensus view into
policy-relevant action documents.
<P>
In addition to these well-publicized assessments, some
200 multilateral agreements target regional and global action
to protect the environment (UNEP, 1993; Bergesen and Parmann,
1994; CIESIN, 1996). This multitude of agreements illustrates
the inherent complexity of environmental issues and of the mechanisms
to deal with them. The complexities also arise from the persistence
of changes and their impacts and from the fact that fundamental
socio-economic and institutional aspects of life underlie every
environmental problem.
<P>
The regional or global nature of environmental problems further
complicates the assessment and formulation of effective responses.
Even though the contribution of a single country to an environmental
problem may seem insignificant taken on its own, the global total
of individual contributions can result in degradation that is
larger than the sum of the parts. By the same token, unilateral
actions to deal with such problems will be less than optimally
effective. Finally, different regions and nations have varying
perspectives and priorities on the urgency of many environmental
issues. These complexities make the production of comprehensive,
policy-relevant assessments a challenging task.
