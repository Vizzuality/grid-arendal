<H2>The Arctic</H2>

There is no single definition for delineating the Arctic.
Geographers often use the Arctic Circle at a latitude
of 66&#176;33'N. Climatologists define the Arctic
as a climatic region often using the 10&#176; July isotherm as
the boundary. Ecologists use boundaries determined by
differences in animal and plant communities, such as the treeline
that marks the boundary between taiga forest and tundra (Stonehouse,
1989). The Arctic region typically includes the northern parts
of Canada, Finland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, the
United States (Alaska), and the whole of Greenland and Iceland.
In contrast to the Antarctic, the most northern parts of the Arctic
are dominated by the large and deep Arctic Ocean, surrounded by
shallow shelves that border the continental masses of North America
and Eurasia.
<P>
In total, the land mass amounts
to 14.8 million square kilometres (CAFF, 1996a), and the Arctic
marine area covers approximately 20 million square kilometres
(AMAP, personal communication, 1996).Maximum sea ice
covers an area of approximately 23 million square kilometres in
March and a minimum area of 8 million square kilometres in September
(EEA/NPI, 1996).
<P>
As with the Antarctic, the Arctic
environment is inextricably linked with global climate and sea
level. Change in the global climate could have a profound impact
on Arctic terrestrial and marine systems. One possible scenario
of the impact of climate change in the region is that global warming
would decrease snow and ice cover and hence reduce albedo and
increase solar energy absorption, leading to faster warming of
the region. The ocean's ability to trap carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere is reduced when the waters become warmer. In addition,
methane and other greenhouse gases trapped in the permafrost may
be released as ice melts. The melting of glaciers would also contribute
to sea level rise; recent work suggests that the Greenland ice
sheet has made a positive contribution to the sea level rise of
10-25 centimetres observed over the last 100 years (IPCC, 1996).
<P>
The relatively pristine Arctic region
is threatened by human activities in a number of ways. This large
area of sea and sparsely populated land has been perceived as
an unlimited resource open for exploitation as well as for the
dumping of waste. Arctic areas have been inhabited by humans since
the end of the last Ice Age, but population densities have always
been low (EEA/NPI, 1996). During most of history the human influence
has been limited to local fishing, hunting and gathering, simple
agriculture, and pastoralism-widespread but not extensively damaging.
The more recent human activities in the region include exploiting
ocean fisheries, the forest industry, mining, metallurgic industry,
petroleum exploration, tourism, and military activity (EEA/NPI,
1996). Furthermore, the changing life-styles of the indigenous
inhabitants, infrastructure development, urbanization, and local
waste problems are creating additional pressures. These human
activities, together with long-range transported pollutants, threaten
many of the natural species and habitats of the Arctic.
