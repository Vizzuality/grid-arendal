<H2>The Way Ahead</H2>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>W</STRONG></FONT>orld-wide, rapid and profound changes are occurring
in many social, institutional, and economic systems.
Continued impoverishment of large parts of the global population,
increased disparities both within and among nations, and rapid
globalization-particularly through developments in information
technology, transport, and trade regimes-are observed. In many
countries, there are trends towards decentralization of environment
responsibilities from national to subnational authorities,
an increasing role for the transnational corporations in environmental
stewardship and policy development, and a move towards integrated
environmental policies and management practices. Increased willingness
by Governments to co-operate on a global basis is witnessed by
the multitude of world summits in the last decade. The question
arises, however, as to how this willingness is translated into
concrete and effective actions. There is greater recognition and
popular insistence that the wealth of nations and the well-being
of individuals lie not just in economic capital, but in social
and natural capital as well.
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>A</STRONG></FONT>gainst this background of change, many fundamental global environmental
trends are emerging from the diverse regional accounts of priority
environmental concerns-global and regional, current and future-summarized
in this report:

</TABLE>
<P>
There are also widespread social trends, intrinsically linked to the environment, that have negative feedback effects on environmental trends, notably:

<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>I</STRONG></FONT>f one were to distill four key priority areas that emerge from
the <I>GEO-1 Report</I> for immediate, enhanced, and
concerted action by the international community, energy, environmentally
sound technologies, fresh water, and benchmark data are obvious
choices. Many other urgent action areas are apparent in the report
as well. But these four, although touching on different levels
at which action should be taken, address key areas needing attention
if the world is to reverse the negative environmental trends highlighted
in the <I>GEO Report</I>. Economic cost-benefit analyses
will need to be conducted in conjunction with concerted international
action in these areas.
<P>
<B><H3>Energy efficiency and renewable energy resources.</H3></B> Current
patterns of energy use require drastic changes because of destructive
impacts on land and natural resources, climate, air quality, rural
and  urban settlements, and human health and well-being. The need
for ever higher levels of energy to fuel economic development
in all regions of the world and the absence of significant world-wide
advances in the development and application of alternative energy
sources and increased energy efficiency will inevitably exacerbate
environmental degradation. Alternative energy sources are being
developed but need to be vigorously pursued and their application
enhanced. Energy efficiency-that is, energy density per unit of
production, whether industrial, domestic, or agricultural-still
needs to be greatly improved, and emissions need to be reduced.
Consideration should be given to declaring an Energy Decade, or
decades, for that matter, until energy sustainability is reached.
<P>
<B><H3>Appropriate and environmentally sound technologies world-wide.</H3></B> Appropriate technological improvements, which
result in more effective use of natural resources, less waste,
and fewer pollutant by-products, are required in all economic
sectors-but particularly in industry, agriculture, transportation,
and infrastructure development. Truly global availability and
world-wide application of the best available and appropriate technology
and production processes, including best traditional practices,
has yet to be ensured through the exchange and dissemination of
know-how, skills, and technology and through appropriate finance
mechanisms. Despite years of deliberation, countries have yet
to agree on how to reach consensus on international mechanisms
to serve the vital interests of both developers of technologies
and those countries that need access to them, as well as on international
finance mechanisms.
<P>
<B><H3>Global action on fresh water.</H3></B> Water will be the major impediment
for further development in several regions. Not only is unsafe
water having a negative impact on human and ecosystem health but
also the scarcity of water, together with insufficient arable
land, will increasingly pose a threat to food self-sufficiency
in several regions, forcing a dependance on food trade. Greater
efforts are needed to resolve issues related to land-based sources
of pollution, non-point source runoff from agricultural and urban
areas, protection of groundwater reserves, water pricing, the
impact of development projects on ecosystems, and competing demands
for water among different societal sectors, among rural and urban
communities, and among riparian countries. Globally, a much stronger,
more integrated, and extensive programme on water is required
to address the green (food) and brown (health) fresh-water issues
as well as traditional blue water issues.
<P>
<B><H3>Benchmark data and integrated assessments</H3></B>. Assessments
are required continually to guide rational and effective decision-making
for environmental policy formulation, implementation, and evaluation
at local, national, regional, and global levels. To improve the
global capability for keeping the environment under continuous
review, urgent action is required in the following fields:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="../ge/green.gif"><BR><BR></TD><TD>investment in new and better data collection, in the
harmonization of national datasets, and in the acquisition of
global datasets;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="../ge/green.gif"><BR><BR></TD><TD>increased understanding of the linkages among different
environmental issues as well as of the interactions between environment

<TR><TD><IMG SRC="../ge/green.gif"><BR><BR></TD><TD>the development of cost-effective,
meaningful, and useful methods for monitoring environmental trends
and policy impacts at local, national, regional, and global levels.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<A NAME="fig0_6"></A>Figure 6 illustrates the relationships among key actions, major
environmental trends, and the ensuing overall improvements in
environment and human health and well-being. To achieve advances
in one or all of these key areas for action, a change in the &quot;hearts
and minds&quot; of everyone will be required, along with a world-wide
transition towards equity and resource efficiency. The necessary
financial resources will have to be made available at national
and international levels. Estimates have indicated that if 2-3
per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) could be devoted to environmental
education, protection, and restoration, great strides could be
made in halting the progress of major negative environmental trends.
Implementing the pledges made at Rio to increase development aid
to the equivalent of 0.7 per cent of industrial countries' GDP
and to provide new additional funding is the prerequisite for
initiating action to reverse global environmental degradation.
