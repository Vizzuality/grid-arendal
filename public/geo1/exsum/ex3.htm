<H2>Overview of Regional Status and Trends</H2>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>N</STRONG></FONT>ot surprisingly, <I>GEO-1</I> confirms both striking similarities and marked differences among regions in
terms of which environmental issues are of primary concern today.
Chapter 2 elaborates the priorities in the different regions with
regard to land, forests, biodiversity, water, marine and coastal
environments, atmosphere, and urban and industrial environments.
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>I</STRONG></FONT>n regions where food security and poverty alleviation are priorities,
such as Africa, West Asia, and parts of Asia-Pacific and Latin
America, the primary emphasis regarding land is its availability,
the abatement of land degradation, and efficient land and water
management. The limited availability of arable land and loss of
land to urban expansion are particularly important to small island
states and the West Asian region. Degradation of drylands
is an urgent global problem, placing some 1 billion people in
110 countries at risk, mainly in developing regions. In highly
industrialized regions, ameliorating soil contamination and combating
acidification are priorities.
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>W</STRONG></FONT>ith regard to forests and biodiversity, the impacts of development
activities and the advance of the  agricultural frontier are of
concern in developing regions, while forest and biodiversity conservation
receive major attention in the North. The decade 1980 to 1990
witnessed a decline in the world's forests and wooded land of
some 2 per cent; while the area of forest in industrial regions
remained fairly unchanged, in developing regions natural forest
cover declined 8 per cent. In Europe, air pollution (including
acid rain), pests and diseases, and forest fires were the main
causes for forest degradation. Biodiversity is of particular concern
both to Latin America and the Caribbean and to Asia and the Pacific,
which together house 80 per cent of the ecological megadiversity
countries of the world. As yet, no region-based assessment of
the state of the world's biodiversity is available, and of a working
figure of 13 million species, only 13 per cent have been scientifically
described. World-wide habitat loss and fragmentation, the lack
of biological corridors, and the decline in biological diversity
outside protected areas constitute primary threats to overall
biodiversity.
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>A</STRONG></FONT>ll regions experience problems
related to either ground water or surface water or both. Every
day, 25,000 people die as a result of poor water quality, and
waterborne diseases still represent the single largest cause of
human sickness and death world-wide. Some 1.7 billion people,
more than one third of the world's population, are without safe
water supply. In addition, an estimated one quarter of the world
will suffer from chronic water shortages in the beginning of the
next century. The development and efficient management of water
resources is a priority concern in West Asia, Africa, and Asia
and the Pacific. In Europe and North America, the protection of
water resources from contamination, acidification, and eutrophication
are highest on the agenda. Water supply to regions hosting megacities
is a concern world-wide, particularly with regard to protection
of ground-water resources, intrusion of salt into fresh-water
supplies, and land subsidence. More than 1.5 billion people depend
on ground water for their drinking water. Other global priorities
are the equitable distribution of water among riparian countries
sharing international river basins, non-point sources of pollution,
and the impacts of major dams and diversion projects. Water will
be the major impediment to development in the future in several
regions.
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>A</STRONG></FONT>bout 60 per cent of the world population lives within 100 kilometres
of the coastline, and more than 3 billion people rely in some
manner on coastal and marine habitats for food, building sites,
transportation, recreation, and waste disposal. Around one third
of the world's coastal regions are at high risk of degradation,
particularly from land-based sources of pollution and infrastructure
development. European coasts are most affected, with some 80 per
cent at risk, followed by Asia and the Pacific, with 70 per cent
of the coast at risk. In Latin America, some 50 per cent of the
mangroves are affected by forestry and aquaculture activities.
Oil spills are particular threats in West Asia and the Caribbean,
while infrastructure development for the tourism industry puts
stress on natural coastal areas around the world, particularly
in small island developing states. There is widespread alarm in
Asia and the Pacific, North America, Europe, and West Asia regarding
the overexploitation of marine fisheries and consequent declining
stocks of commercial fish species. Globally, more than 60 per
cent of marine fisheries are heavily exploited.
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>A</STRONG></FONT>ir pollution problems are multifaceted and pervasive. All major
cities in the world suffer urban air quality problems; in Eastern
Europe, air quality is considered the most serious environmental
problem. Acid rain and transboundary air pollution, once problems
only in Europe and parts of North America, are now becoming apparent
in parts of the Asia-Pacific region as well as parts of Latin
America. Large regions are at risk from the effects of both climate
change and acidification. Despite co-ordinated action world-wide,
damage to the ozone layer continues faster than expected, with
the next 10 years predicted to be the most vulnerable. Cases of
non-compliance and growth in illegal trade in ozone-depleting
substances are emerging problems. All regions express concern
over global warming, but special emphasis is placed by developing
countries on the need for adaptive mechanisms to cope with accompanying
climate variability and sea-level change. The rapidly rising demand
for energy to fuel economic development will aggravate these problems,
particularly in Asia and the Pacific, where a 100-per-cent increase
in energy use is predicted for 1990-2010, and in Latin America,
with a predicted energy growth of 50-77 per cent. It is expected
that for the near future, fossil fuels-coal, oil, and natural
gas-will continue to be the primary energy source.
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>T</STRONG></FONT>he impacts of current consumption and production patterns and
associated waste generation, particularly on personal health and
well-being, are high on the priority list in both North America
and Western Europe and are of concern to other regions, particularly
with regard to the use of natural resources for production and
consumption processes outside the regions. Subregions with emerging
 economies, such as those of Eastern Europe, South East Asia,
and parts of Latin America and West Asia, face problems associatedwith rapid industrialization. Rising levels of pollutants and
greenhouse gases create serious problems of acidification, urban
air quality deterioration, and transboundary pollution-all posing
increasing health risks. Accumulation of radioactive waste, and
the effects of past radioactive spills remain of particular concern
in Eastern Europe.
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>T</STRONG></FONT>hese problems are compounded by rapid urbanization, particularly
in coastal zones, and the widening gap between the rich and the
poor. More than half of humankind will live in urban areas by
the end of the century, a figure that will increase to 60 per
cent by 2020, when Europe, Latin America, and North America will
have more than 80 per cent of their populations living in urban
areas.
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>T</STRONG></FONT>he polar regions, representing the largest remaining
natural ecosystems on Earth, are also increasingly coming under
stress, particularly from long-range pollutant transport and deposition.
Their crucial role in climate regulation and the vulnerability
of their fauna and flora warrant special attention.
<P>
<A NAME="tab0_1"></A><FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>A</STRONG></FONT>lthough poverty and the growing global population are often targetted
as responsible for much of the degradation of the world's resources,
other factors-such as the inefficient use of resources (including
those of others), waste generation, pollution from industry, and
wasteful consumption patterns-are equally driving us towards an
environmental precipice. Table 1 indicates the relative importance
of environmental issues within and across regions.

<A NAME="tab0_2">Table 2 reflects trends for the same issues, without depicting the rate of changes
in these trends. In many instances, although trends are increasing,
the rate of increase over the years has slowed down or was less
than the rate of increase in economic growth previously experienced
by countries with comparable economic growth. This suggests that
several countries are making the transition to a more sustainable
environment at a lower level of economic development than industrial
countries typically did over the last 50 years.

<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>A</STRONG></FONT>s nations develop, different sets of environmental concerns assume
priority. Initially, prominence is given to issues associated
with poverty alleviation and food security and development- namely,
natural resource management to control land degradation, provide
an adequate water supply, and protect forests from overexploitation
and coastal zones from irreversible degradation. Attention to
issues associated with increasing industrialization then follows.
<A NAME="fig0_3"></A>Such problems include uncontrolled urbanization and infrastructure
development, energy and transport expansion, the increased use
of chemicals, and waste production. More affluent societies focus
on individual and global health and well-being, the intensity
of resource use, heavy reliance on chemicals, and the impact of
climate change and ozone destruction, as well as remaining vigilant
on the long-term protection needs of natural resources. Figure
3 illustrates the observed progression on environmental priority
issues.
