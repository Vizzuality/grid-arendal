<H2>Overview of Regional Policy Responses</H2>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>C</STRONG></FONT>hapter 3 summarizes policy responses to environmental
issues in different regions; it indicates that typically these
responses focus first on institutional and constitutional issues,
and then on the implementation and enforcement of often disjointed
sectoral environmental legislation and regulations. Subsequent
actions concentrate on developing comprehensive strategic and
integrated plans for the protection of the environment, such as
National Environmental Action Plans, and an array of concerted
<A NAME="fig0_4"></A>command-and-control measures. Later, attention is given to introducing
market-based incentives research, creating conducive environments
for voluntary, flexible, and innovative actions, and stimulating
increased participation and commitment by all sectors of society.
Figure 4 illustrates this pattern in policy responses.

<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>P</STRONG></FONT>rogression through the cascade of policy responses is often constrained
in developing regions by weak institutions, insufficient human
and financial resources, ineffective legislation, and a lack of
compliance monitoring and enforcement capabilities. In other instances,
environmental institutions and regulations have been introduced
at the request of external forces, such as international conventions
and strategies, donor requirements, and structural adjustment
programmes, and are only later internalized by countries.
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>I</STRONG></FONT>n the more developed regions of the world, experience with environmental
management and conservation is extensive and of longer duration.
Adequate safeguards in the initial stages were largely achieved
through Government-regulated command-and-control policies. Effective
implementation of such policies relied on legislation and measures
such as emission standards and limits as well as on maximum permitted
rates of resource use. Today, countries are increasingly using
a mix of command-and-control policies and market-based incentives
to achieve cleaner and more  resource-efficient production systems
and to modify consumers' attitudes. More integrated approaches
that rely on cleaner production processes rather than on end-of-pipe
solutions and accounting on a cradle-to-grave basis are being
tested in a number of countries, addressing the industrial, agricultural,
forestry, transportation, and fishery sectors. These measures
have not yet been used to their full potential anywhere.
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>A</STRONG></FONT>lthough there is repeated acknowledgement of both the &quot;vicious
cycle of poverty&quot; and its intrinsic linkages with the environment
and the urgency to address poverty alleviation, little evidence
emerged from the regional reports that effective and concerted
actions have been taken since Rio to ensure that environmental
policies benefit the poorest members of society. Only anecdotal
evidence suggests striking individual and community solutions,
as in income-generating initiatives recounted at the UNEP Global
Assembly of Women and the Environment in 1992.
A vacuum still remains at the national level for linking environmental
protection to social investment, such as education, better health
care, and employment generation for the poor, especially women.
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>E</STRONG></FONT>mpowerment of communities and the growth of environment-oriented
NGOs in civil society are increasingly recognized in all regions
as powerful mechanisms to advance sustainable development. However,
real participation and commitment to the environmental cause by
civil society often follows clear Government action in the implementation
of environmental policies. In regions where such governmental
policies are weak and ineffective, public participation and empowerment
are generally low.
<P>
<A NAME="tab0_3"></A><FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>D</STRONG></FONT>espite the contradicting tendencies described above,
a heartening sign is the tendency to strengthen regional and
subregional co-operation world-wide. This might well prove to
be one of the most powerful mechanisms to move national and global
institutions forward towards sustainable development. Table 3
depicts environmental regional policy responses and their relative
importance within and across regions.
