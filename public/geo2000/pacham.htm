<p><b><i>Environmental Crisis As Seen By World Youth:<br>
"Don't Treat Earth As Poorly As Parents Have"
</i></b>

<p><h1><i>Pachamama, Our Earth, Our Future</i>, is
Launched as Educational Guide for Youth to
Environmental Problems, Solutions</H1>

</center>

<p>NEW YORK/NAIROBI, 26 October 1999 - The
Earth's condition is deteriorating in nearly every
category, ranging from the water we drink, the air we
breathe and the oceans and forests that sustain all life,
according to a book by and for youth about the global
environment.

<p><i>Pachamama: Our Earth, Our Future</i>, is a special
youth edition of UNEP's <i>Global Environment Outlook
2000</i>.  Created as a global environmental primer for
11- to 14-year olds, the book is being launched today,
October 26.

<p><i>Pachamama</i>  (a word meaning Mother Earth in the
Inca culture) is the product of youth editors, designers
and hundreds of young contributors worldwide, with
the support of UNEP and Peace Child International.
UNESCO and UNICEF were also project partners.

<p>The book's young editors warn readers that, if they
behave as recklessly as their parents, "the good ship
Planet Earth will crash sometime in the not too distant
future.

<p>"We don't have an environmental problem," they add.
"We have social, economic and political problems that
greatly affect our environment."

<p>The 96-page book contains information, case studies,
games, and topics for classroom discussion of major
environmental issues, ranging from atmospheric and
freshwater problems to urbanization and the protection
of polar areas.	 It is complemented by two companion
publications, a teacher's guide and suggestions to
youth for taking action - including a "how-to" guide
for reaching political leaders.

<p>UNEP's original <i>Global Environment Outlook 2000</i>,
released in September 1999, took  2&frac12; years to
complete and offers a comprehensive assessment of
the state of the planet, based on input from 850
international contributors. It identifies policy deficiencies and
recommends actions needed in each world region.

<p>In its organization and essential messages about the
world's environmental situation and prospects,
<i>Pachamama</i> follows UNEP's authoritative <i>GEO-2000</i>
report, but presents the interpretation of young people
through their poignant art work, poetry and prose.

<p>The youth contributors also often add their own biting
commentary.  Describing the 1984 Bhopal disaster,
which led to 2,500 deaths and 350,000 illnesses,
teenager Neha Smritt of India writes: "The accident
was bad (but) what happened afterwards was almost
worse: Union Carbide has never admitted
responsibility for the disaster and has not apologized
to its victims.	 They have paid minimal compensation
to those who lost loved ones and have done little to
provide medical care to the 50,000 or so who still
suffer... Governments need to be tougher on
companies like Union Carbide."

<p>Millennium Young People's Congress
The official launch of <i>Pachamama</i> is slated for the
Millennium Young People's Congress, Hawaii, Oct.
26.  Some 500 young people from around the world
will convene Oct. 25 to 29 to focus global attention on
priorities for the new millennium.

<p>In a survey of 10,000 youth conducted during
preparations for the book, the environment and
associated problems were most often cited as Earth's
most pressing priority, followed by human rights,
education, peace and health.  Environmental concerns
ranked among the top four youth priorities in 44
countries, including the U.K., Japan, U.S., Canada,
Japan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, South
Africa, Uganda, Jordan, Kuwait, Norway, Belgium,
Finland, Spain, Ukraine, Belarus, Bolivia, Peru,
Ecuador, and Australia.

<p>Top Environmental Trends
In a section entitled "What Scientists Say,"
<i>Pachamama</i> looks into the future and presents the
consensus of 200 international experts (canvassed by
UNEP for <i>GEO-2000</i>) who put climate change and
freshwater scarcity at the top of a 24-point list of key
21st Century environmental issues.

<p>Juxtaposed with the scientific consensus is the
collective view of 10,000 youth surveyed during
<i>Pachamama</i>'s preparation, who say the world's top 10
positive and negative emerging environmental issues
and trends are:

<p>Top 10 negative trends:
<ul>
<li>Increased pollution
<li>Worse water pollution
<li>More deforestation
<li>Water scarcity
<li>Intensified hunting of animals
<li>More toxic waste
<li>More air pollution
<li>Over-population
<li>Widening ozone hole
<li>Increased amounts of rubbish
</ul>

<p>Top 10 positive emerging trends:
<ul>
<li>Increased recycling
<li>Higher environmental awareness
<li>More reforestation
<li>More measures against pollution
<li>Greater animal protection
<li>More power to NGOs
<li>More use of solar energy
<li>More natural food products
<li>Water conservation
<li>More protection of rainforests
</ul>

<p>Klaus Toepfer, Executive Director of UNEP, calls
<i>Pachamama</i> "an inspired, sometimes frightening
collection of case studies, poems and drawings to tell
the story of our global environment.

<p>"Some things (youth) have to say are disturbing -
adults have acted irresponsibly in caring for the
environment.  But young people are also
enthusiastically dedicated to their future - a future
where Mother Earth is healthy and where people work
together to solve our current and future problems."

<p>UNEP Director's three-point challenge to youth
Dr. Toepfer offers youth readers a three-point
challenge, urging them to:

<ul>
<li>"Talk about the problems that you see in
	    your own environment with your friends,
	    family and teachers;
<p>
<li>"Make an action plan on how you can
	    improve your environment in the new
	    millennium - and write me in 12 months
	    telling me the difference that you have
	    made;
<p>
<li>"Challenge yourself and your leaders to
	    bring the concept of sustainable
	    development, especially environmental
	    and social justice, to the center of local,
	    national and international
	    decision-making."
</ul>

<p>Said David Woollcombe, Director, Peace Child
International:	"Making <i>Pachamama</i> was a wonderful
experience of partnership between young people and
UN Environment Programme experts.  The young
people had very strong ideas about the shape and title
of the book, and UNEP was determined that their
book should achieve the same standards of accuracy
as the <i>GEO 2000</i> original.  It worked! UNEP
accepted the young people's  unusual title, and the
young people accepted all UNEP's detailed
corrections to the text and both groups are delighted
with the result."

<p>Cecilia Weckstrom of London, 23-year-old designer
of <i>Pachamama</i>, said producing the book involved
recruitment of hundreds of groups around the world to
read and summarize the original <i>GEO-2000</i>.  "The
hardest part was choosing from thousands of
contributions," she said.  "We could have made 10
books!

<p>"This book was a joy to work on; in both editorial
meetings, there was an abundance of talent in writing,
illustrating and environmental action. The individuals
from all over the world melded very quickly into an
excellent working team."

<p>Preparation of the book was funded by the UN
Foundation for International Partnerships.  It retails
for &pound;7.99 and may be ordered from U.K. publisher
