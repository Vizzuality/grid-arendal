<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size=4 color="#002E96"><b>Social policies</b></font>
<P>Improving health, education and living conditions remains the top policy imperative for many countries. Such improvement is vital for ensuring the political stability and social sustainability needed to move toward greater economic and environmental sustainability.
<P>Nevertheless, social policies have had an unequivocal impact on the environment in many countries. Programmes devised to fight poverty and especially extreme poverty have often ignored environmental policies. Many projects that damage the environment have been considered valuable because of the employment they generate. Some housing programmes have fuelled urban growth and discouraged better use of existing urban areas. The regulatory approach characteristic of environmental management in most countries is dissociated from social policies, which have often clashed with environmental management. Practices and regulatory measures that benefit the industrial sector have often ignored environmental deterioration and its impacts on the quality of life.
<P>Population growth in many countries continues to exceed the growth of agricultural production and the resulting food deficit is aggravated by the scarcity of land and water resources. A lack of education is often associated with a lack of environmental awareness.
<P>New policies and strategies for environmental and natural resources management for sustainable development are beginning to emerge, in line with the innovative approach of Agenda 21. Many countries have adopted policies to stabilize or moderate population growth rates. Greater equity, however, is needed in the distribution of the opportunities and benefits of national economic development and international aid programmes. At present, too few national or international aid programmes reach or benefit the poor majority.
<P>The success of efforts directly targeted at poverty alleviation has varied. For example, direct support programmes to provide subsidized food have sometimes resulted in food deliveries going largely to the better-off in urban areas, and subsidized credit programmes have resulted in loans failing to reach the poor, being used for consumption, and often not being repaid.
<P>Some governments have developed social policies that have emphasized the promotion of sustainable human settlements. The priority targets have been the basic needs of the rural population, especially shelter and safe drinking water, and human resource development, for example education and training.
<P>Some of the key policy concerns and main objectives for a new agenda and strategy on equity-led growth for sustainable development are set out in the table. The matrix links the critical basic needs (water, food health, shelter and services, energy, education and income) with the overall and interrelated goals of economic, social and environmental sustainability. Developed in the context of Southern Africa, the matrix applies equally to much of the developing world. The social sustainability and equity issues are the new and crucial link between economic and environmental sustainability issues and objectives.
