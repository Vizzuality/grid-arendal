<P>Natural forests cover 47 per cent of the land area of Latin America, and the Amazon basin accounts for one-third of the world's tropical forest area. These forests are an important source of products, fuelwood and employment for local people, a major source of foreign exchange for governments, serve important functions in protecting watersheds and freshwater resources, act as a storehouse for carbon and support a significant portion of the world's biodiversity (Daily 1997). As reported in Chapter 2, Latin America is still losing around 58 million hectares of natural forest per year, although the rate of deforestation in, for instance, the Amazon has slowed considerably since the mid-1990s.
<P>A recent study by CIAT/PNUMA (1998) shows that 84 per cent of deforestation in Latin America is due to expansion of the agricultural sector, 12.5 per cent is due to logging and 3.5 per cent is due to the construction of infrastructure. In addition, demographic pressure, unemployment and inequitable land distribution are important drivers for the further degradation of forests. An increased and unsustainable intensification of land use is projected. At the same time, there is a gross imbalance between destruction and reforestation, with only 1 hectare planted for every 25 hectares destroyed. The combination of these trends leads to the prospect of increased soil degradation, more frequent flooding and the degradation of freshwater resources.
<P>Forestry policies in the region have been focused largely on the tropical rain forests, concentrating on protection and sectoral perspectives, and have not been well integrated with economic and social strategies. Lack of finance, technology, personnel and training have all hindered environmental management; furthermore, in some countries, large and complex legal frameworks are coupled with unclear definitions of the responsibilities of the environmental institutions involved. Clearly, forestry policy in the region has not, overall, been effective. One important reason is that policies have failed to take account of the diverse functions of the forest and the differing needs of forest users and inhabitants.
<P>Comprehensive forest policy frameworks at national level are fundamental to sustainable forest management in Latin America. National forest programmes demand a broad inter-sectoral approach at all stages (formulation, implementation and monitoring). Moreover, they should be tailored to each country's social, economic, cultural, political and environmental situation. Appropriate policies could include direct control of government-owned forests and indirect control using fiscal incentives in the form of taxation, subsidies and forest credits; other incentives such as the granting of private property rights; market reforms; the introduction of community forestry schemes; and improvements in extension, research and education.
<P>The alternative policy study carried out for <i>GEO-2000</i> (UNEP 1999d) indicates that these policy tools could be used to stimulate programmes in ten different areas:
<ul><li>Rehabilitation of degraded areas, particularly those damaged by slash-and-burn agriculture.</li>
<li>Development of agroforestry, which experience in Rondonia (World Bank/MMA 1998) has shown to be a viable economic alternative to crude logging, providing that areas and species are carefully selected and that forest 'mining' is addressed by severe taxes.</li>
<li>Development of sustained forestry management through zoning, the establishment of forest corridors and complete bans on the exploitation of floodable forest areas.</li>
<li>Establishment of networks of protected areas, buffer zones and ecological corridors in which traditional forest uses by indigenous peoples would be encouraged - such areas would need to be established in all the major ecological zones from dry scrublands to the important wetlands.</li>
<li>Finding mechanisms to allow more of the wealth of forest regions to be returned to those who live there. In the Amazon, for example, mahogany is extracted from Indian reserves for US$50/m<sup><small>3</small></sup>, fetches US$800/m<sup><small>3</small></sup> in the port of Bel&eacute;m City, Par&aacute; State, in Brazil and is then sold in European markets for US$1 500/m<sup><small>3</small></sup> (IBAMA 1998). The primary forest producers are poorly rewarded for what ends up as an expensive product. These price distortions indicate the necessity of improving regulation in the mahogany timber market, coupled with an inspection system and an inventory of mahogany resources to reduce pressure on mahogany species. Local forest products can also be encouraged, such as the vegetable leather handbags and clothes now being produced from latex in the Brazilian state of Amazonas.</li>
<li>Construction of environmentally-sustainable cities in tropical forest regions which would stimulate economic development while preserving the forest resources on which all forest settlements are based.</li>
<li>Disciplined exploitation of natural resources through national policies to control pollution from mining and the activities of small-scale illegal mining activities. The mineral wealth of the Amazon should be controlled by integrated activities of all Amazon countries to provide effective pollution control.</li>
<li>Development of ecotourism to catalyse economic development and protect the environment. This has to be properly set up and managed, in order to prevent negative impacts. Good high-quality examples with large turnover do exist in the region, in particular in Costa Rica (Costa Rica 1996).</li>
<li>Development of effective forestry institutions capable of licensing and monitoring activities.</li>
<li>Improvements in forest-related training, information and educational activities.</li>
</ul><P>Packages of these policies adapted to national conditions could achieve a number of goals simultaneously. These include:
<ul><li>reducing deforestation rates, forest fires, numbers of threatened animal and plant species, and regional carbon dioxide emissions;</li>
<li>a slowing down of agricultural expansion onto forest land;</li>
<li>improvements in forest ecosystem health, the quality of urban and rural life, and regional and local economies; and</li>
<li>the provision of appropriate technologies to forest dwellers as a tool for sustainable development.</li>
</ul><P>A broad range of alternative policy tools could be used, and individual countries could select from this mix a policy package suited to their own social, cultural and economic conditions, thus making for better integrated forest policies.
