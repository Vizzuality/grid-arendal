<b>Life's
a gas...</b>
<p><b><font color="#00A36F">The
global warming crisis ...and a new enemy</font></b>
</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>If one issue has dominated
the environmental debate during the last decade it is global warming.
<p>Most reliable sources now
agree that failure to control the emission of greenhouses gases like carbon
dioxide (CO<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>) will
contribute to a temperature rise of 1.0-3.5 degrees Celsius by the year
2100.
<p>The grave consequences of
this rise are well known to many. They include a rise in sea levels, which
will displace millions of people in low-lying delta areas and on island
states, reduced agricultural production in the tropics and sub-tropics,
where there is already widespread food deficiency, unpredictability in
the supply of fresh water, the reintroduction of serious diseases like
malaria to Europe and the wholesale loss of important ecosystems and biodiversity.
<p><b>Disastrous consequences</b>
<br>In addition to these developments,
there is little doubt that climatic change is a major contributory factor
in making natural disasters nightly television news. The rising incidence
and increased severity of windstorms, fires and floods seems to have its
roots in disrupted weather patterns.
<p>The UN estimates that three
million people perished as a result of natural disasters in the last three
decades. According to the Munich Reinsurance Company, global economic losses
during 1997 and 1998 reached $120,000 million - eight times higher than
the 1960s.
<p>As a result of the UN-sponsored
Kyoto Protocol, efforts are under way to slow down CO<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>
emissions - though there is little sign that these are sufficiently far-reaching
to have any major impact on the problem. In 1996, CO<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>
emissions hit a record high of 23,900 million tonnes.
<p><b>GEO-2000</b> concludes
that meeting Kyoto targets "is a formidable challenge for some countries
but only a first step in bringing under control what is generally agreed
to be the most critical environmental issue the world faces. Even if all
the targets agreed at Kyoto were met, this would have an insignificant
effect on the stabilization levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere."
<p><b>The New Nitrogen Threat</b>
<br>While the issues surrounding
CO<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub> and global warming
have been well-publicised, nitrogen has also emerged as a major concern
for the coming century. If CO<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>
is the price paid for rapid industrial development, then nitrogen loading
in the environment is the direct consequence of intensive agriculture and
the cultivation of leguminous crops.
<p>Human activities have doubled
the amount of nitrogen available for uptake by plants (Vitousek and others
1997). Unfortunately, half of all nitrogen applied to plants in the form
of fertilisers is lost to the air or dissolved in water. We are fertilising
the Earth on a global scale and in a largely uncontrolled experiment.
<p>While fertiliser consumption
is stable in industrialised countries, it is on the increase in developing
nations. The rising demand for food from an ever expanding global population
makes it likely that fertiliser use will increase further in the coming
century.
<p>Controlling nitrogen emissions
is critical for a number of reasons. For example, increased nitrogen levels
in water supplies has meant the introduction of costly purification systems
in countries like the US. Nitrogen-based gases are also a key contributor
to air pollution.
<p>Excess nitrogen levels also
trigger unwanted plant growth in estuaries and coastal areas. A massive
increase in algal blooms is leading to underwater oxygen starvation which,
in turn, is responsible for significant fish kills in areas like the Black
Sea, Baltic Sea and Chesapeake Bay.
<p>Furthermore, nitrogen emissions
already account for 6% of the enhanced greenhouse effect and current trends
suggest this problem will get worse.
<p><b>GEO-2000</b> observes
that there is "growing consensus among researchers that the scale of disruption
to the nitrogen cycle may have global implications comparable to those
caused by disruption of the carbon cycle."
