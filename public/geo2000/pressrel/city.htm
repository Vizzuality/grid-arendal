<b>City of Dreams...</b>

<p><b><font color="#00A36F">The
quest for the sustainable city</font></b>
</font>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>The world's population
will reach 6 billion during the year UNEP's <b>GEO-2000</b> is published.
Currently, a staggering 80 million people a year are added to the total
population.

<p>The brunt of this growth
will be borne by urban areas. In the last 50 years, the population in and
around cities has grown from 750 million to 2.5 billion, mainly as a result
of rural communities migrating to urban areas. By 2025, the world's
cities will be home to 5 billion - with 90 per cent of growth coming in
developing nations.

<p>Numerous environmental issues
are raised by the creation of so-called "megacities". Most obviously, urban
residents generally consume more resources than rural dwellers. This creates
an "ecological footprint" which is much greater than the actual area a
city covers.

<p>London's ecological
footprint, for example, considering only its consumption of food and forest
products, and the area needed to assimilate its carbon dioxide emissions
is 125 times greater than the area of the city itself.

<p>The problems for urban populations
are particularly acute in the developing world. The issues they face include
backlogs in housing and infrastructure development, overcrowded transportation
systems, deteriorating sanitation and environmental pollution.

<p>Nevertheless, people continue
to migrate to cities in search of a better life. In Africa, cities such
as Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Lagos and Kinshasa have grown sevenfold between
1950 and 1980. All told, 600 million people in Africa, Asia and Latin America
live in squatter settlements or shanty towns.

<p>The results of this demographic
shift to cities are catastrophic. According to <b>GEO-2000</b>, "inadequate
provision of water, sanitation, drainage and garbage removal" means many
people's lives and health are under continuous threat." This should
also be seen as an indictment of the conditions in the countryside that
have driven people into cities.

<p>City dwellers generate large
quantities of solid waste and sewage which cannot be adequately managed.
In Lusaka, for example, inhabitants produce 1400 tonnes of solid waste
daily - 90% of which is not collected because the local authority has too
few staff, funds and equipment.

<p>This lack of sanitization
has led to an increase in water-borne diseases. More than 1.5 million people
a year die in Africa from malaria - a disease which spreads via poor drainage
in urban environments.

<p>The water issue also highlights
urban inequities. The poor majority in urban slums generally pay four times
more for safe water than those in elite residential areas.

<p>Urban inhabitants do not
just suffer from inadequate sanitation. Air pollution, mainly due to fossil
fuel burning for motor vehicles and industry, is an equally severe problem
in developing cities. In China, smoke and particles from burning coal cause
50,000 premature deaths and 400,000 new cases of chronic bronchitis a year
in 11 of its largest cities.

<p>Chemical discharge is also
a widespread problem. In Southeast Asia, much industrial waste, including
hazardous chemicals, are discharged without treatment. On a positive note,
many countries have introduced legislation to combat the problem.

<p>One key issue, which is often
overlooked, is the impact that urban living has on environmental awareness.
<b>GEO-2000</b> points out that "most of the world's children born
in the 21st century will be born in cities with their perceptions and consumption
behaviour shaped by an urban environment."

<p>The fear of <b>GEO-2000</b>
is that "the innate environmental sensitivity of people raised on the land
or close to nature is being lost."

<p>This very real threat needs
to be countered by measures designed to raise understanding. As part of
its recommendations, <b>GEO-2000</b> stresses that environmental education,
like mathematics, should be "an integral part of the standard educational
curriculum." Better public access to environmental information also needs
to be provided.

<p>Perhaps the toughest educational
requirement outlined by <b>GEO-2000</b> is for engineers, economists and
the media to be acquainted with the implications of environmental degradation
on urban and rural dwellers alike. However, <b>GEO-2000</b> also acknowledges
the efforts of local authorities "joining forces to promote the concept
of the sustainable city."
