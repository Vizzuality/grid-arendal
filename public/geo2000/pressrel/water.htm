<b>Water,
water, everywhere...</b>
<p><b><font color="#00A36F">Tackling
the global water crisis</font></b>
</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In a specially-commissioned
survey for UNEP's <b>GEO-2000</b>, 200 leading scientists from 50 countries
around the world identified a shortage of clean water as one of the most
pressing problems facing humanity.
<p>Already 20% of the world's
population lacks access to safe drinking water, while 50% lacks access
to safe sanitation. This situation is set to worsen dramatically.
<p>The World Meteorological
Organization predicts that if there is no change to current consumption
patterns, two out of three people will live in water-stressed conditions
by the year 2025. In other words, water consumption will be running at
an unsustainable level.
<p>Perhaps inevitably, the problem
is most acute in Africa and West Asia. In Africa, for example, 14 countries
already experience water stress or water shortage. Another 11 countries
will join that list in the next 25 years.
<p>However the problem is a
global one. Economic growth in territories such as China, India and Indonesia
is constrained by the prevailing water conditions. Even in water-abundant
North America, the growth of municipal and industrial demands for water
has "led to conflicts over water rights" and is "a constraint to growth
- especially in the west and southwest of the USA," says <b>GEO-2000</b>.
<p>Clearly, part of the global
water problem is increased usage of water for domestic, industrial and
agricultural purposes - a direct response to the increased population.
Agriculture alone accounts for 70% of water usage - mainly for crop irrigation.
As the world's population grows, so irrigated land is expected to
becoming increasingly significant in feeding people.
<p>Water quality is also a major
concern. Sewage in particular is a severe hazard. According to <b>GEO-2000</b>,
"In many developing countries, rivers downstream of major cities are little
cleaner than open sewers." Worldwide, polluted water is estimated to affect
the health of about 1200 million people and contribute to the death of
15 million children under five every year.
<p>Sewage is not the only cause
of water pollution. Intensive use of pesticides and fertilisers has increased
the level of nitrates in water. This can lead to brain damage and even
death among children. Industrial waste is also a significant polluter -
giving rise to contamination with heavy metals. In a study of 15 Japanese
cities, it emerged that 30% of all groundwater supplies are contaminated
by chlorinated solvents from industry. In some cases, solvents from spills
travelled 10km from the source of pollution.
<p>Water shortage increases
social inequity. In regions such as Gujurat in India, where groundwater
levels have dropped considerably, poor farmers cannot sink boreholes to
the necessary depths to extract water. Wealthier farmers can benefit by
moving inland to buy up more land.
<p>In regions like Africa, uneven
water distribution is clearly a problem. The Congo River basin contains
10% of Africa's population but 30% of the continent's run-off.
The Niger Delta receives abundant rain while the neighbouring Sahara gets
virtually none.
<p>With an estimated 300 million
people in Africa short of water, there is understandable concern about
how to manage access to safe water. According to <b>GEO-2000</b>, 50 rivers
in Africa are shared by two or more countries. "Access to water from any
of these shared rivers could provoke conflict, particularly in the Nile,
Niger, Volta and Zambezi."
<p>An even more critical picture
is emerging in West Asia (which centres on the Middle East). Here the pace
of population growth far exceeds the development of water resources.
<p>Without urgent water management,
says <b>GEO-2000</b>, a major environmental problem will emerge - perhaps
resulting in "escalating conflict over shared surface and groundwater resources
if agreements are not reached on equitable allocations." With continued
political tensions across the region, water management is a matter of some
urgency for global policy-makers.
<p>A fundamental theme to emerge
from <b>GEO-2000</b> is the need to understand linkages between major environmental
problems. While "good water management can solve many of the problems of
pollution and scarcity," it cannot be handled in isolation.
<p>Clearly, large cities need
to develop co-ordinated responses to sewage and industrial pollution while
agriculture needs to minimise wastage. According to <b>GEO-2000</b>, "40-60%
of Africa's irrigation water is lost through seepage and evaporation."
Not only is this a waste of valuable resources, it also leads to problems
like soil salinization and water-logging.
<p>Likewise, the intensive use
of fertilisers is responsible for introducing unhealthy levels of nitrates
to the water supply. Effective control of nitrogen-based fertilisers could
minimise water loss and have a beneficial impact on global warming.
<p><b>GEO-2000</b> concludes
that water management is "inextricably linked with land issues." A holistic
approach requires: co-ordination of the management of land and water resources,
establishment of secure land and water property rights where these do not
exist, reorganization of policies at river basin level, introduction of
concepts of shared and equitable water use and alternatives to use of marginal
land.
<p>What is not known is how
far humanity's impact on the climate will exacerbate the water problem.
<b>GEO-2000</b>
warns that "water managers are becoming increasingly concerned about the
impact of climatic variability on water resources - including those associated
with El Ni&ntilde;o."
