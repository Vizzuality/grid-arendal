global, act sustainable...</b>
<p><b><font color="#00A36F">Globalisation
and the environment</font></b>
</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Little of any long-term significance
will be achieved in the conservation of the environment without support
from the private sector. The increasing shift towards corporate globalization
means that decision-making at large transnational companies is often more
influential than local and regional policy-making.
<p>Statistics illustrate the
point. In 1996, foreign exchange trading by big investors amounted to $350
million million - ten times the world's GDP.
<p>Private foreign investment,
concentrated primarily in middle-income countries in Asia and Latin America,
was US$250,000 million - compared to overseas development assistance (ODA)
of US$50,000 million.
<p>Indeed, ODA from governments
is generally decreasing. While this reduces the ability to deliver public
goods, private concerns such as transnational corporations, banks and pension
funds are unlikely to pick up the bill for public health and environmental
infrastructure costs.
<p>This situation is exacerbated
by the massive debt burden which affects developing countries, notably
in Africa. Environmental protection is often one of the first things to
be cut back to finance interest payments.
<p>Globalization is a concern
at a number of levels. From a purely practical point of view, it drives
global demand for an unsustainable level of consumption. At a time when
the developed world needs to cut back on per capita consumption, transnational
businesses are building a "vast global middle class," says <b>GEO-2000</b>.
"What will be the environmental impact of 3-4 billion consumers with rising
incomes, who all want to live an affluent lifestyle?"
<p>Clearly, improved living
conditions are highly desirable if sustainable. "But since some planetary
resources may be too limited to support this increased consumption, how
will resulting tensions (with the billions of poor) be resolved?"
<p>Globalization has other harmful
impacts on the environment, such as "stratospheric ozone depletion, climate
change driven by global warming and the worldwide spread of persistent
organic pollutants," says <b>GEO-2000</b>.
<p>Biological globalization
is also a concern. Travel and trade allow organisms to move around the
world and invade new environments - sometimes on purpose, sometimes by
accident.
<p>However benefits from standardising
business processes in order to maximise productivity and profit may prove
to be short-lived, says <b>GEO-2000</b>. The danger is that newly-introduced
methods of cultivation may "upset the ecological balance and crowd out
desirable, useful or perhaps unique species. Many varieties and breeds,
often evolved over centuries of local selection, have desirable features
that adapt them to particular local environments, resisting specific diseases
and environmental extremes."
<p>Such diversity may be the
answer to sustainable agriculture. "Excessive globalization today could
destroy much of the potential for agriculture tomorrow," warns <b>GEO-2000</b>.
<p>International trade, like
globalization, cannot be divorced from environmental concerns. Clearly,
trade can increase wealth for many countries - which is part of the reason
why the world is moving headlong towards increased trade liberalization.
<p>But it can also harm the
environment. "Where environmental issues are not incorporated in economic
prices and decision-making, trade can magnify unsustainable patterns of
economic activity and resource exploitation," says <b>GEO-2000</b>.
<p>A disturbing dimension to
this problem has emerged recently as countries challenge national environmental
protection measures on the ground that they erect barriers to trade. Efforts
to protect sea turtles, dolphins and sea birds have been struck down for
exactly this reason.
<p>As part of its recommendations
in <b>GEO-2000</b>, UNEP stresses the need for linkages between trade and
international finance on the one hand and environmental policy on the other.
While the finance world is now beginning to make such linkages, there is
much more to be done in assessing the impact of trade liberalization.
<p>One positive development
to emerge from the growth of the private sector is increased militancy
on behalf of its customer-base. NGOs, civil society groups and stake-holders
"now form influential lobby groups - as well as spearheading a wide range
of environmental-related activities at grass roots level."
<p>In turn, some areas of the
private sector have responded to the concerns of their consumers by introducing
codes of conduct, responsible care programmes and voluntary reporting on
environmental activities. There is no room for complacency however. "Improved
environmental performance of large-scale industry has not been echoed by
small and medium-sized firms which need both help and encouragement," says
