<b>Looking
on the bright side</b>
<p><b><font color="#00A36F">Some
environmental success stories</font></b>
</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It would be wrong to conclude
a review of <b>GEO-2000</b> without acknowledging some remarkable progress
towards halting environmental degradation.
<p>Perhaps the most significant
has been increased public concern over environmental issues. <b>GEO-2000</b>
points out that "until recently, few individuals cared about or even knew
of the environmental issues facing the planet. Today, popular movements
in many countries are forcing authorities to make changes."
<p>This trend towards responsible
citizenship is matched in some quarters by the corporate sector. Voluntary
action on the part of major industries has led to a reduction in resource
usage and the elimination of waste. Self regulation, corporate environmental
policies, cleaner production systems, voluntary codes of practice (such
as the chemical industry's Responsible Care Programme) and the use
of environmental audits are all to be applauded.
<p>The fact that these actions
are in industry's own self interest should not detract from their
environmental significance. In fact, this realisation of these win-win
situations should be welcomed. If more cases can be found where environmental
and business interests are compatible, the overall benefits to the planet
and its populace will be extremely significant.
<p>Governments in developed
regions can also take credit for reducing the levels of air pollution in
many major cities. "Innovative legislation has been introduced and the
goal of zero emissions in several important areas is no longer considered
utopian," says UNEP's<b> GEO-2000</b>.
<p>Great strides have been taken
locally by Agenda 21 initiatives which have proved an effective way of
developing and implementing sustainable development policies that involve
communities and political agencies. At an international level, widespread
support for the Montreal Protocol means the ozone layer is widely expected
to have recovered within half a century. Such success should give critics
of international organizations pause for thought.
<p>Since 1992 and the UN-sponsored
Kyoto Protocol further steps have been taken to combat global climate change.
At the same time, the world's scientists, meteorologists and climatologists
are all gaining insight into the likely impact of climate variation.
<p>If the environmental battle
is to be won, it will be because of the foundations laid down by the above
activities. "Global issues have been recognised and effectively tackled
for the first time in the latter part of the 20th century," says<b> GEO-2000</b>.
"It is important to make sure that these global lessons filter down to
regional, national and local levels - concerted action always achieves
more than individual initiatives at every level."
