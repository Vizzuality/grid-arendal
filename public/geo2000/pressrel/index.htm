<b>Press
Release...</b>
<p><b><font color="#00A36F"><i>"Our present course is unsustainable - postponing action is no longer an option"</i></font></b>
</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>NAIROBI, 15 September 1999 - </b>Today, the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP) launches <b>Global Environment Outlook 2000</b>
(<b>GEO-2000</b>) - the most authoritative assessment ever of the environmental
crisis facing humanity in the new millennium.
<p>Based on contributions from
UN agencies, 850 individuals and 30 environmental institutes, <b>GEO-2000</b>
outlines progress in tackling existing problems and points to serious new
threats. It concludes its report by setting out recommendations for immediate,
integrated action.
<p><b>GEO-2000</b> analyses
both global and regional issues. Its key finding is that: "The continued
poverty of the majority of the planet's inhabitants and excessive
consumption by the minority are the two major causes of environmental degradation.
The present course is unsustainable and postponing action is no longer
an option."

<p><b>"Despite successes on various
fronts, time for a rational, well-planned transition to a sustainable system
is running out fast," says Klaus T&ouml;pfer, UNEP's Executive Director. "In some areas, it has already run out. In others, new problems are emerging which compound already difficult situations."</b>

<p><b>"UNEP welcomes the trend towards increased public concern for the environment. Until
recently, few individuals cared about or even knew of the environmental issues facing the planet. Today, popular movements in many countries are forcing authorities to make changes," says T&ouml;pfer.</b>

<p>According to <b>GEO-2000</b>,
full scale emergencies now exist in a number of fields. The world water
cycle seems unlikely to be able to cope with demands in the coming decades,
land degradation has negated many advances made by increased agricultural
productivity, air pollution is at crisis point in many major cities and
global warming now seems inevitable.
<p>Tropical forests and marine
fisheries have been over-exploited while numerous plant and animal species
and extensive streches of coral reefs will be lost forever - thanks to
inadequate policy response.
<p>In a survey conducted by
the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment for <b>GEO-2000</b>,
200 scientists in 50 countries identified water shortage and global warming
as the two most worrying problems for the new millennium. Desertification
and deforestation at national and regional level was also a frequently
cited concern.
<p>While most issues raised
are well-known, <b>GEO-2000</b> also identifies new threats such as:
<ul>
<li>
nitrogen's harmful impact
on ecosystems</li>

<li>
increased severity of natural
disasters</li>

<li>
species invasion as a result
of globalization</li>

<li>
increased environmental pressures
caused by urbanization</li>

<li>
decline in the quality of governance
in some countries</li>

<li>
new wars which impact on both
the immediate environment and neighbouring states</li>

<li>
the impact of refugees on the
natural environment</li>
</ul>
At the core of <b>GEO-2000's</b>
recommendations is a reinforcement of Agenda 21's call for environmental
integration. "The environment remains largely outside the mainstream of
everyday human consciousness and is still considered an add-on to the fabric
of life," says <b>GEO-2000</b>.
<p>Institutions such as treasuries,
central banks, planning departments and trade bodies frequently ignore
sustainability questions in favour of short-term economic options. "Integration
of environmental thinking into the mainstream of decision-making relating
to agriculture, trade, investment, research and development, infrastructure
and finance is now the best chance for effective action," says <b>GEO-2000</b>.
<p>National Governments, international
organizations, private sector, community groups, NGOs and ordinary citizens
all have a role to play in putting the environment at the forefront of
the political agenda, says <b>GEO-2000</b>. "Environmental education, like
mathematics, (should be) part of the standard educational curriculum,"
says <b>GEO-2000</b>, adding that we must "encourage the media to devote
as much attention to environmental issues as they do to crime, politics,
sport and finance."
