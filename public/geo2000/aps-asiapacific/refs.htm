<a name=1><P>1. The region is divided into South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Greater Mekong sub-region, Northwest Pacific and East Asia, and Australia and the Pacific.</P></a>
<br><br><br>
<a name=2><p>2. The Asia-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) was developed by an Asian collaborative project team composed of NIES, Kyoto University of Japan, and seven research institutes of China, India, Indonesia and Korea. Regional and local air pollutants considered in AIM include sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and suspended particulate matter (SPM). The emissions of these pollutants are calculated on the basis of energy production/use processes, land use changes and industrial processes. The environmental Kuznetz curve was adopted to simulate the reduction processes of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and SPM emissions. The health impacts are also studied focusing on the increment of infant mortality rate by SPM.</p></a>
<br><br><br>
<a name=3><p>3. Woodruff and others (1997) studied a relation between infant mortality rates and SPM concentration. They showed that when SPM increases by 10 mg/m<small><sup>3</sup></small>, relative risk increases 1.04 times (the 95% confidence level is 1.02-1.07). Here a relative risk is an index that expresses the increased risk of the group exposed to selected pollutants. Woodruff defined the relative risk as: RRi = exp(b/DPMi). (RR represents a relative risk, b is a coefficient (0.003922 for infant), DPM is increase of SPM, and i represents an area of interest.) The relation between atmospheric concentration and relative risk is estimated based on epidemiological studies. The change of infant mortality is estimated based on the change of relative risk, population projection and infant mortality in the base year. If the increase of SPM concentration is reduced by half, the resultant increase of relative risk will be almost half.
