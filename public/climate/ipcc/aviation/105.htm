<h3> 7.6.4. Current Understanding of Chemical Changes in Turbine and Exhaust Nozzle</h3>
<p>Approximately 99.5-99.9% of the molar content of typical commercial engine
  exhaust consists of N<span class="subscript">2</span>, O<span class="subscript">2</span>, CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O. The species that compose the remaining
  0.1-0.5% exist in trace amounts. This trace exhaust component consists primarily
  of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, CO, unburned HC (including soot), the hydroxy family (HO<span class="subscript">x</span>, H<span class="subscript">2</span>Ox), the
  sulfur oxide family (SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O), and elemental species such as O. <a href="104.htm#img726">Figure
  7-26</a> provides a general categorization of chemical processes occurring in
  the turbine and exhaust nozzle. These processes are discussed in greater detail
  below. </p>

<h4>7.6.4.1. Primary Exhaust Constituents (H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">2</span>)<a name="7641"></a></h4>
<p>Apart from the small effect of reactions involving trace species, changes in
  major species concentration in the turbine and nozzle flow path are caused by
  the diluting effect of cooling air. CO<span class="subscript">2</span> changes less than a few tenths of a
  percent as a result of oxidation of CO (increases in H<span class="subscript">2</span>O from HO<span class="subscript">x</span> recombination
  are even smaller). This CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fractional increase may grow in the first stages
  of the high-pressure turbine as more advanced cycles are implemented because
  associated cycle changes may result in relatively more CO at the entrance to
  the turbine (Godin et al., 1995, 1997; Leide and Stouffs, 1996). Current small
  changes and likely future changes in primary exhaust constituents can be predicted
  with sufficient accuracy (Dryer et al., 1993) for assessment needs, however,
  and the levels are all relatively easy to derive from measurements.</p>

<h4>7.6.4.2. Secondary Combustion Products (NO, NO<span class="subscript">2</span>, N<span class="subscript">2</span>O, SO<span class="subscript">2</span>, CO, stable HC)<a name="7642"></a></h4>
<p>Secondary products-such as NO, NO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and SO<span class="subscript">2</span>, as well as their oxidative products
  SO<span class="subscript">3</span>, HONO, HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>, and H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>-formed via reactions initiated with the reactive
  radicals OH and O are the principal participants of interest in chemical and
  microphysical processes occurring soon after emission. Although OH and O are
  reduced considerably by the engine exit, they continue to play an important
  role in global atmospheric processes (see <a href="020.htm">Chapters 2</a> and
  <a href="031.htm">3</a>). To understand the processes occurring through the
  engine, relative and absolute levels of these secondary combustion products,
  their oxidative products (the acid gases), and the reactive radicals need to
  be accurately characterized. Emissions indices for NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, CO, and HC, as measured
  by ICAO procedures for stages in a standard LTO cycle, are documented (ICAO,
  1995b) for most in-use engines as part of the engine certification process;
  these emissions typically correspond to tens to hundreds of ppmv. SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O emissions
  are directly proportional to the level of sulfur in the fuel [a 400 ppmm fuel
  S level corresponds to an EI(SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O) of 0.8]. Emissions of metals, whether from
  impurities in the fuel or engine wear, are much smaller than the emissions discussed
  here but may be of interest in soot activation and condensation processes (Chen
  et al., 1998; Twohy et al., 1998). NO<span class="subscript">x</span> does not change significantly through
  the turbine and nozzle other than through changes resulting from dilution, although
  the NO<span class="subscript">2</span>/NO ratio may shift as a result of increased oxidation. Oxidation of
  NO and NO<span class="subscript">2</span> to HONO and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>, respectively, is predicted to be on the order of
  a few percent or less, occurring largely in the high-pressure turbine (Fahey
  et al., 1995a; Anderson et al., 1996; Lukachko et al., 1998). Although this
  change in the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> level is not significant, changes in HONO and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> represent
  important changes in trace species of NOy (see below). Ground-based and in-flight
  measurements indicate that emissions of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O are also small relative to NO<span class="subscript">x</span> (Kleffmann
  et al., 1994; Fahey et al., 1995b). Further validation of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> chemistry is warranted,
  but indications are that current models can predict NO<span class="subscript">x</span> evolution in the turbine
  and nozzle with sufficient accuracy for assessment needs (Dryer et al., 1993),
  and measurements of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> with a few percent accuracy are possible. </p>
<p> For typical civil engines, CO and HC are relatively unchanged through the
  turbine and exhaust nozzle. However, they can be reduced by up to two orders
  of magnitude in the turbine and exhaust nozzles (Godin et al., 1995, 1997; Leide
  and Stouffs, 1996; Lukachko et al., 1998) of advanced cycle military engines,
  where completion of oxidation in the high-temperature regions of the turbine
  results in the modest increases of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> mentioned above. Measurements of these
  species CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and total hydrocarbons) are routine, and it is possible to measure
  them to several percentage points accuracy (Katzman and Libby, 1975; Spicer
  et al., 1992, 1994; Dryer et al., 1993; Howard et al., 1996).</p>
