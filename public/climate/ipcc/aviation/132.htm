<h2>9.1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The nature and composition of aircraft emissions has been described in <a href="013.htm">Chapter
  1</a>, and their effects on the composition of the atmosphere are described
  in Chapters <a href="020.htm">2</a> and <a href="031.htm">3</a>. <a href="044.htm">Chapter
  4</a> uses aircraft emissions data in modeling studies to provide chemical perturbations
  that feed into the ultraviolet (UV) irradiance and radiative forcing calculations
  presented in Chapters <a href="054.htm">5</a> and <a href="063.htm">6</a>, respectively.
  In this chapter, the aircraft emissions data that were used in calculations
  described in Chapters <a href="044.htm">4</a> and <a href="063.htm">6</a> are
  presented and discussed. </p>
<p>Compilation of global inventories of aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions has been driven
  by requirements for global modeling studies of the effects of these emissions
  on stratospheric and tropospheric ozone (O<span class="subscript">3</span>). 
  Aircraft carbon dioxide CO<span class="subscript">2</span>)
  emissions are easily calculated from total fuel burned. Early studies used one-
  (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) models of the atmosphere (see <a href="026.htm">Section
  2.2.1</a>). Most of these early studies considered effects on the stratosphere
  (e.g., COMESA, 1975), but some also included assessments of the (then) current
  subsonic fleet on the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (e.g., Hidalgo
  and Crutzen, 1977; Derwent, 1982). An early height- and latitude-dependent emissions
  inventory of aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> was given by Bauer (1979), based on earlier work by
  A.D. Little (1975). This work was used by Derwent (1982) in a 2-D modeling study
  of aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions in the troposphere. </p>
<p>Later estimations of global aircraft emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  were still made by relatively
  simple methods, using fuel usage and assumed EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) (e.g., Nüßer and Schmitt,
  1990; Beck et al., 1992). Concerted efforts were subsequently made by a number
  of groups to construct high-quality global 3-D inventories of aircraft emissions.
  Such work was undertaken for a variety of programs and purposes: United Kingdom
  input to ICAO Technical Working Groups (McInnes and Walker, 1992); the U.S.
  Atmospheric Effects of Stratospheric Aircraft (AESA) Program (Wuebbles et al.,
  1993); the German "Schadstoffe in der Luftfahrt" Program (Schmitt and Brunner,
  1997); and the ANCAT/EC Emissions Database Group (ANCAT/EC, 1995), which combined
  European efforts to produce an aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  inventory for the AERONO<span class="subscript">x</span> Program
  (Gardner et al., 1997). Subsequently, methodologies for the production of global
  3-D inventories of present-day aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions (based on 1991-92) have
  been refined and have produced results that have largely superseded earlier
  work. These inventories cover the 1976-92 time period and have been extended
  to the 2015 forecast period. These gridded inventories-which calculate aviation
  emissions as distributed around the Earth in terms of latitude, longitude, and
  altitude-have been produced by NASA, DLR, and ANCAT/EC for national and international
  work programs (Baughcum et al., 1996a,b; Schmitt and Brunner, 1997; Gardner,
  1998). </p>
<p>This chapter is not the first attempt to synthesize information on aircraft
  emissions inventories; earlier assessments were made by the World Meteorological
  Organization (WMO)/ United National Environment Programme (UNEP) (1995) Scientific
  Assessment of Ozone Depletion, ICAO's Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection
  (CAEP) Working Group 3 (CAEP/WG3, 1995), the NASA Advanced Subsonic Technology
  Program (Friedl, 1997), and the European Scientific Assessment of the Atmospheric
  Effects of Aircraft Emissions (Brasseur et al., 1998). </p>
<p>Any assessment of present and potential future effects of subsonic and supersonic
  air transport emissions relies heavily on input emissions data. Thus, considerable
  effort has been expended on understanding the accuracy of present-day inventories
  and the construction of forecasts and scenarios. Forecasts are quite distinct
  from scenarios, as noted in <a href="013.htm">Chapter 1</a>. Forecasts of aviation
  emissions for a 20-25 year time frame are generally considered possible, whereas
  such confidence is not the case for longer time frames. Thus, scenarios generally
  rely on many more assumptions and are less specific than forecasts. </p>
<p>In planning this Special Report, it was clear that there were no gridded emission
  scenarios of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from subsonic aircraft for the year 2050 that could
  be used as input to 3-D chemical transport models (see Chapters <a href="020.htm">2</a>
  and <a href="044.htm">4</a>). The IPCC made a request to ICAO to prepare 3-D
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> scenarios, which was carried out under the auspices of ICAO's FESG (CAEP/4-FESG,
  1998). The UK DTI also responded to this requirement, producing an independent
  3-D NO<span class="subscript">x</span> scenario for 2050 (Newton and Falk, 1997). The EDF had also published
  scenarios of aircraft emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and 
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> extending to 2100 (Vedantham
  and Oppenheimer, 1994, 1998), but these scenarios were not gridded; thus, although
  the aviation CO<span class="subscript">2</span> scenarios could be used in radiative forcing calculations (see
  <a href="063.htm">Chapter 6</a>), the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> scenarios could not be used to calculate
  O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbations and subsequent radiative forcing. Other scenario data exist
  for aircraft emissions, including those from WWF (Barrett, 1994) and MIT (Schafer
  and Victor, 1997). As with the EDF data, these scenarios were not gridded for
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions, therefore could not be used in 
  O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbation calculations in
  <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>. Furthermore, the MIT data do not explicitly
  represent aircraft emissions; instead, they cover high-speed transport modes,
  including some surface transportation modes. </p>
<p>HSCT scenarios prepared for NASA's AESA Program are considered distinct from
  subsonic scenarios; these HSCT scenarios represent a technology that does not
  yet exist but might be developed. Therefore, the HSCT scenarios represent a
  quite different set of assumptions from other long-term scenarios, which only
  consider continued development of a subsonic fleet. The HSCT scenarios were
  used in modeling studies (Chapters <a href="044.htm">4</a> and <a href="063.htm">6</a>)
  as sensitivity analyses for studying the effects of their emissions on stratospheric
  O<span class="subscript">3</span>. </p>
<p>In this chapter, methodologies of inventory and forecast construction are compared,
  and a review and assessment of long-term scenarios and their implicit assumptions
  provided. This is the first detailed consideration of long-term scenarios and
  their implications. </p>
<p>By way of background, <a href="133.htm">Section 9.2</a> provides an overview
  of factors that affect aircraft emissions, such as market demand for air travel
  and developments in the technology. The aircraft emissions data discussed in
  this chapter are of four distinct types: Historical inventories (e.g., for 1976
  and 1984); inventories that represent the "present day" (i.e., 1991-92); forecasts
  for 2015; and long-term scenarios for 2050 and beyond. The methodologies and
  a comparison of historical, present-day, and forecast inventories are presented
  in <a href="134.htm">Section 9.3</a>. <a href="138.htm">Section 9.4</a> describes
  and comments on available long-term scenarios for 2050 and beyond. Scenarios
  of high-speed civil transport (HSCT) that incorporate certain assumptions about
  the development of a supersonic fleet and its impact on the subsonic fleet are
  presented separately in <a href="142.htm">Section 9.5</a>. Finally, <a href="143.htm">Section
  9.6</a> discusses underlying assumptions and drivers of long-term subsonic scenarios.
  The plausibility of the assumptions are also considered in terms of implications
  for fleet size, infrastructure requirements, and global fossil-fuel availability.</p>
