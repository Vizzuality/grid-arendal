<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly established
  by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment
  Programme (UNEP) in 1988 to: (i) assess available information on the science,
  the impacts, and the economics of, and the options for mitigating and/or adapting
  to, climate change and (ii) provide, on request, scientific/technical/socio-economic
  advice to the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework
  Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Since then the IPCC has produced a series
  of Assessment Reports, Special Reports, Technical Papers, methodologies, and
  other products that have become standard works of reference, widely used by
  policymakers, scientists, and other experts. </p>
<p>This Special Report was prepared following a request from the International
  Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Parties to the Montreal Protocol
  on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The state of understanding of the
  relevant science of the atmosphere, aviation technology, and socio-economic
  issues associated with mitigation options is assessed and reported for both
  subsonic and supersonic fleets. The potential effects that aviation has had
  in the past and may have in the future on both stratospheric ozone depletion
  and global climate change are covered; environmental impacts of aviation at
  the local scale, however, are not addressed. The report synthesizes the findings
  to identify and characterize options for mitigating future impacts. </p>
<p>As is usual in the IPCC, success in producing this report has depended first
  and foremost on the enthusiasm and cooperation of experts worldwide in many
  related but different disciplines. We would like to express our gratitude to
  all the Coordinating Lead Authors, Lead Authors, Contributing Authors, Review
  Editors, and Expert Reviewers. These individuals have devoted enormous time
  and effort to produce this report and we are extremely grateful for their commitment
  to the IPCC process. </p>
