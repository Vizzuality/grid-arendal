<h2> 7.7. Engine Emissions Database and Correlation</h2>
<p>Since the early 1970s, when engine manufacturers started measuring emissions
  to demonstrate compliance with regulations developed for the airport vicinity,
  there has been a steady increase in data available for the development and refinement
  of databases associated with subsonic aircraft engine emissions. This section
  provides a brief overview of current ICAO engine standards and the status of
  the emissions database. It also discusses methods used to correlate sea-level
  emissions measurements with in-flight levels. Special emphasis is placed on
  simplified methods of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> prediction and their validation for inventory purposes,
  as well as emissions variability.</p>
<h3>7.7.1. ICAO Engine Standards and Emission Database<a name="771"></a></h3>
<p>To control pollutants from aircraft in the vicinity of airports, ICAO established
  emissions measurement procedures and compliance standards for soot (measured
  as smoke number-SN), unburned hydrocarbons, carbon moNO<span class="subscript">x</span>ide, and oxides of nitrogen.
  A landing and take-off cycle was defined to characterize the operational conditions
  of an aircraft engine within the environs of an airport; this LTO cycle is illustrated
  in <a href="105.htm#img728">Figure 7-28</a>. The standards are applied to all
  newly manufactured turbojet and turbofan engines that exceed 26.7 kN rated thrust
  output at International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) sea level static (SLS) conditions.
  The smoke standards took effect in 1983, and those for gaseous emissions took
  effect in 1986. Measurements of the exhaust emissions of a single engine are
  performed at the manufacturer's test facilities as part of the certification
  process, in compliance with the requirements of ICAO international standards
  and recommended practices of Annex 16 to the convention on international aviation
  (ICAO, 1993).</p>
<p>The data are published in an ICAO exhaust emissions data bank (ICAO 1995b).
  Engine emissions are given for the standardized LTO cycle represented by an
  engine power setting of 7 (taxiing), 30 (approach), 85 (climb-out), and 100%
  (take-off) of rated output and given times in mode (see <a href="105.htm#img728">Figure
  7-28</a> and <a href="105.htm#tab78">Table 7-8</a>). Together with fuel flow,
  emission indices of HC, CO, and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in g per kg of fuel burned and maximum SN
  are reported. For a variety of engines, the measured SNs for all power settings
  are provided. Except for smoke, the emissions of each LTO cycle mode (EI x fuel
  flow x time in mode) are summed (Dp) and expressed in the form 
  Dp/F<span class="subscript">00</span> (g kN) where (F<span class="subscript">00</span>) 
  is the maximum thrust of the engine at take-off under ISA SLS conditions.

<p>The emissions measurements are taken at the exit plane of the engine's exhaust
  nozzle (within 0.5 nozzle diameter). Kerosene-type fuel complying with specified
  properties-density, heat value, boiling points, aromatics (15-23% volume), sulfur
  (less 0.3% mass), hydrogen (13.4-14.1% mass)-is used. No additives for smoke
  suppression are allowed. A set of correction procedures, approved by ICAO bodies,
  has been developed for gaseous emissions to ensure that the observed emission
  indices can be compared at reference day conditions [ISA SLS pressure (101.325
  kPa) and temperature (288.15 K)]. For NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, an additional correction is made
  to take account of ambient humidity, using as a reference an absolute humidity
  value of 0.00629 kg water per kg dry air (about 60% relative humidity). For
  economic reasons, only a small sample of engines of any type is tested. For
  regulatory purposes, therefore, a statistically based correction is used to
  account for engine-to-engine variability resulting from manufacturing tolerances.
  To ensure that the mean value of a population of an engine type will meet the
  given limits of standards within a confidence level of 90%, an additional factor
  is applied to the measured mean value of the LTO cycle emission (Dp/F<span class="subscript">00</span>) to
  give the so-called characteristic value, which must be in compliance with the
  regulatory level. The additional statistical factor-derived from a variety of
  engines measured by all engine manufacturers-depends on the emission species
  and the number of engines tested. For two engines to be regarded as representative
  of a type, the increases applied to the mean measured emissions value for each
  species are as follows: +10.0% for NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, +13.9% for CO, +30.1% for HC, and +17.3%
  for SN. The relative amount to be added to the measured value decreases with
  the number of engines tested. <a href="105.htm#tab78">Table 7-8</a> shows an
  example of engine emission data extracted from an ICAO data sheet submitted
  by the manufacturer with two engines tested. </p>
<p>Ongoing revision of the regulatory level (see last line of <a href="105.htm#tab78">Table
  7-8</a>), as well as the entire emission certification process, is one of the
  objectives to be followed by CAEP. </p>
<p>The HC, CO, and SN standards have remained unchanged within the CAEP process.
  For NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, the approach was to tighten NO<span class="subscript">x</span> stringency in accordance with technology
  gains. The baseline (see line CAEP/1 in <a href="106.htm#img729">Figure 7-29</a>)
  had been introduced to allow NO<span class="subscript">x</span> to rise with maximum engine pressure ratio
  and associated temperature, a parameter that strongly influences the rate of
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> production (see also <a href="098.htm">Section 7.4.3</a>). In a second stage,
  the regulatory NO<span class="subscript">x</span> level was decreased by 20%. This level is often referred
  to as the CAEP/2 standard (<a href="106.htm#img729">Figure 7-29</a>); it has
  been effective for new engine types since 1996 and will apply to newly manufactured
  engines from the year 2000. From 2004 onward, a further reduction in the LTO
  regulatory values of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> was agreed at a fourth meeting of the CAEP (see line
  CAEP/4 in <a href="106.htm#img729">Figure 7-29</a>). This value is 16.25% below
  the CAEP/2 standard at an engine pressure ratio of 30, with some allowances
  for engines with higher pressure ratios.</p>
<p>Present regulatory procedures based on the LTO cycle were designed to address
  airport air quality problems, but the CAEP is now pursuing new certification
  methodologies that take account of the flight mode as well. Although there are
  links between trends in LTO and flight exhaust emissions, new correlation procedures
  (see below) are needed to enable ground test measurements to be used to provide
  quantitative methods for predicting altitude emissions from aircraft. Aircraft
  engines produce many different emissions. However, only emissions that have
  been derived for use within the ICAO LTO cycle certification process-such as
  HC, CO, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and smoke-or are easily correlated using simple conversion factors
  related to fuel burn (such as CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, and SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O) have been included in significant
  numbers in today's inventory studies. Apart from the major exhaust emissions,
  a large variety of minor species are produced. HC emissions, which are typically
  reported as equivalent mass of CH<span class="subscript">4</span>, can be broken down into numerous complex
  compounds. There has not been sufficient characterization to date for global
  inventory purposes, with most of the available data acquired from a selection
  of military engines using kerosene-type fuel with different specifications.
  Additionally, nitrous oxides (N<span class="subscript">2</span>O) have not been rigorously characterized. Other
  emissions are not currently modeled in emissions databases because of very small
  quantity or the fact that little data exists. This subject is further discussed
  in <a href="104.htm">Section 7.6</a>.</p>
