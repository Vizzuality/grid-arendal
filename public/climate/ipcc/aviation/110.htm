<h2> 7.8.1. Databases on Fuel Properties</h2>
<p>Only two comprehensive, annual surveys conducted on jet fuel properties are
  publiCl<span class="subscript">y</span> available. Both of these surveys have been carried out annually since
  the early 1970s-one by the National Institute for Petroleum and Energy Research
  (NIPER) for U.S. fuels and the other by the Defence Evaluation and Research
  Agency (DERA) for UK fuels. The 1996 DERA survey covered 1467 batches of fuel
  representing 14.85 million m<sup>3</sup> (Rickard and Fulker,1997). The UK survey is thought
  to be fairly representative of fuel used in the rest of Western Europe as well,
  because much of the UK fuel comes from refineries located there. These two surveys
  are useful in defining trends in fuel properties, although they are both sample
  averaged, not volume averaged.<a name="tab711"></a></p>

<p>Three snapshot surveys have been reported. Bowden et al. (1988) reported a
  survey by the U.S. Army Fuels and Lubricants Research Laboratory of 90 JP-8
  fuels from Western Europe, plus one from Singapore and two from Korea. In the
  late 1980s, Boeing conducted a survey of 39 civil aviation fuels from around
  the world (Hadaller and Momenthy, 1990). For the two properties that will be
  discussed here-sulfur and hydrogen contents-the averages and distributions for
  these two worldwide surveys were similar to the UK results. In 1996, a snapshot
  survey of U.S. jet fuel properties was conducted jointly by the American Petroleum
  Institute (API) and the National Petroleum Refiners Association (NPRA); this
  survey included Jet A fuels from 105 refineries representing 2.47 million m<sup>3</sup>.
  Average sulfur levels in this survey agreed very closely with the average NIPER
  sampling for that year, lending some credence to the NIPER results on sulfur
  (API/NRPA, 1997). </p>

<p>For the most part, the design of the combustion chamber determines the gaseous
  and soot emissions from a gas turbine; there are only limited opportunities
  for fuel properties to influence emissions. Certainly there can be significant
  effects over the spectrum of hydrocarbon fuels from methane or natural gas to
  heavy distillate and residual fuels. Within the narrow definition of aviation
  kerosene, however, there is little opportunity for reducing emissions from current
  aircraft by fuel modification, with the exception of steps taken to reduce sulfur.</p>
<p>Nitrogen for NO<span class="subscript">x</span> comes from the air, not the fuel. Jet fuels contain only trace
  amounts of fuel-bound nitrogen, which cause storage stability problems and render
  the fuel unfit for use.</p>
<p>CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions are influenced by fuel composition. A fuel with a higher
  H/C ratio will produce lower CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and correspondingly more water; however, only
  relatively small variations are found in aviation fuel. The NIPER survey of
  U.S. fuels does not record hydrogen content; however, the 1996 UK survey (Rickard
  and Fulker, 1997) and the Boeing survey (Hadaller and Momenthy, 1990) are in
  very good agreement with regard to the range of hydrogen content in jet fuels
  and the mean value. <a href="108.htm#img734">Figure 7-34</a> shows the distribution
  of fuel hydrogen content from the UK survey. The bulk of the data fall between
  13.5 and 14.1% with a mean value of 13.84%. More than 90% of data in the 1989
  Boeing worldwide survey also fall between these same values, with a mean of
  13.85%. Thus, typical emissions indices for CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O are 3.15 ± 0.01 and
  1.25 ± 0.03, respectively, where the variations allow for the range of hydrogen
  content found in jet fuels. </p>
<p>Increasing the hydrogen content of jet fuel has been considered as a way of
  reducing CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions. Currently, the most efficient and effective means of
  generating hydrogen is by steam reforming of natural gas; the thermal efficiency
  of this process is 78.5% (as compared to water electrolysis, with a thermal
  efficiency of 27.2%) (Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 1995). This process
  is expected to remain the most cost-effective means of producing hydrogen for
  the foreseeable future (Tindall and King, 1994). Even if pure methane, which
  has the highest H/C ratio of any fossil fuel, were used as the source, the inefficiencies
  of hydrogen production would result in about three times as much CO<span class="subscript">2</span> being released
  as would be saved from combustion of a fuel with higher hydrogen content. Even
  if hydrogen could be obtained from water without using fossil energy, increasing
  the average hydrogen content by 0.05% (a significant amount) would result in
  only a 0.6% reduction in the amount of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> produced per pound of jet fuel burned
  simply based on stoichiometric combustion calculations. </p>
<p>The most significant effect that changes in aviation kerosene can have on emissions
  is in reduction of SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O; all of the sulfur in the fuel is converted to sulfur
  oxides in the exhaust. The sulfur content in aviation fuels is limited to 0.3%,
  although most aviation kerosene has a sulfur content significantly below this
  limit. <a href="108.htm#img735">Figure 7-35</a> shows the distribution of sulfur
  content for jet fuel in 1996 in the UK. The average sulfur concentration was
  reported as 0.047% (Rickard and Fulker, 1997). The 1996 average reported in
  the NIPER survey was slightly higher, at 0.062%. The average value in the Boeing
  survey was 0.038% (Hadaller and Momenthy, 1990); the U.S. Army survey (Bowden,
  1988) had an average value of 0.07%. However, most of the larger values came
  from two small refineries in southern Europe, whereas larger refineries had
  much lower values. Thus, average sulfur content around the world is probably
  in the range of 0.04-0.06%; this results in a typical EI(SO<span class="subscript">2</span>) of 0.8-1.2. </p>
<p>Most jet fuel contains a sulfur content much lower than the specifications
  allow because of the use of low-sulfur crude oils and/or the use of hydro-processing
  to meet other parts of the jet fuel specification. Sulfur is removed as a part
  of hydro-processing. Purely from equilibrium calculations (without considering
  inefficiencies), 1 mole of hydrogen, as H<span class="subscript">2</span>, is needed to remove 1 mole of sulfur,
  reacting to form H<span class="subscript">2</span>S. At 78.5% efficiency, steam reforming of methane is currently
  the most efficient means to produce hydrogen; it produces about 5.1 moles of
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> per mole of H<span class="subscript">2</span>, hence per mole of sulfur. Assuming 0.06% sulfur in the fuel,
  this figure translates to an average of 0.0033 kg of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> released to produce
  1 kg of sulfur-free fuel. Because burning 1 kg of fuel results in the release
  of about 3.15 kg of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, mandating zero-sulfur fuel would increase the amount
  of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> attributable to aircraft by about 0.1%. </p>
<p>Reducing the sulfur level would have no direct impact on engine performance
  or durability. Although low-sulfur fuels tend to have low lubricity-which can
  lead to accelerated wear in fuel pumps and fuel controls-it is not the sulfur
  that provides the lubricity but organic acids that are removed during the sulfur-removal
  process (Wei and Spikes, 1986). Military fuels use a lubricity additive to guard
  against the possibility of low-lubricity fuels. Civilian airlines have not found
  a need to use such additives, except in a few isolated localities where pump
  failures have occurred and there was little flexibility in fuel selection.</p>
