<h2><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b></h2>
<p>Although aircraft generally fly in corridors, their atmospheric effects are
  expected to propagate far beyond those regions. </p>
<p>For subsonic aircraft flying in the troposphere and the lowermost part of the
  stratosphere, emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) are the primary cause for
  the model-calculated increase in ozone (O<span class="subscript">3</span>) in the upper troposphere (UT). Emissions
  of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, water vapor (H<span class="subscript">2</span>O), and sulfate from supersonic aircraft cruising in
  the stratosphere are expected to decrease the column abundance of O<span class="subscript">3</span>. </p>
<p>The effects of aircraft emissions are strongly dependent on flight altitudes:
  Emissions in the troposphere and the stratosphere have distinctly different
  effects on O<span class="subscript">3</span>. Although the global chemical transport models used in this assessment
  attempt to simulate both the troposphere and the stratosphere, these models
  have been developed for simulating either the troposphere or the stratosphere,
  but not both. Thus, the assessment of O<span class="subscript">3</span> impact focuses on subsonic aircraft
  effects using tropospheric models and supersonic effects using stratospheric
  models. This approach is probably valid for supersonic aircraft, which cruise
  exclusively in the stratosphere (19 km), but it may be problematic for subsonic
  aircraft that have a sizable amount of emissions in the lowest levels of the
  stratosphere (around 12 km at mid-latitudes). The impact of subsonic emissions
  on the stratosphere has not been fully evaluated using models and requires further
  investigation. </p>
<h3><b>Calculations for Subsonic Aircraft Scenarios </b></h3>
<p>Model calculations were designed to assess the effects of added NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. They concluded
  that there would be an increase in ozone concentration and a decrease in methane
  (CH<span class="subscript">4</span>) concentration. </p>
<p>NO<span class="subscript">x</span>-All models compute increases of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the upper troposphere (UT)/lower
  stratosphere (LS) of 50-150 pptv at 12 km at mid-latitudes for 2015; these increases
  are significant compared to the average background levels of 50-200 pptv. </p>
<p>O<span class="subscript">3</span>-The O<span class="subscript">3</span> increase is restricted to northern mid- and high-latitudes, with
  maximum increases in the UT and LS. Subsonic aircraft are predicted to cause
  a maximum annual average O<span class="subscript">3</span> increase of 7-11 ppbv in 2015 in the latitude band
  30-60°N at 10-13 km altitude. This result corresponds to an increase of approximately
  5-10%. </p>
<p>The calculated increase in global average O<span class="subscript">3</span> with increasing NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission from
  aircraft is in broad agreement among different models. Although the models show
  general linearity for O<span class="subscript">3</span> increase from NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission, O<span class="subscript">3</span> production is less efficient
  at high NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission. The global average O<span class="subscript">3</span> increase from aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  is not very sensitive to projected changes in atmospheric composition for the
  model scenarios investigated here. </p>
<p>The O<span class="subscript">3</span> increase may be mitigated somewhat by emitted sulfate, leading to production
  of chlorine moNO<span class="subscript">x</span>ide (ClO), bromine moNO<span class="subscript">x</span>ide (BrO), and hydrogen dioxide (HO<span class="subscript">2</span>)
  in the LS. This process, however, has not been included in the model calculations
  presented in this report. </p>
<p>CH<span class="subscript">4</span>-As a result of increases in tropospheric hydroxyl (OH) caused by aircraft
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions, CH<span class="subscript">4</span> removal rates are computed to increase by 1.6-2.9% in 2015
  and 2.3-4.3% in 2050. The possible influence of changes in CH<span class="subscript">4</span> on climate are
  discussed in <a href="063.htm">Chapter 6</a>. </p>
<h3> <b>Calculations for Supersonic Aircraft Scenarios </b></h3>
<p>Because the supersonic fleet is still in its design stage, the range of emissions,
  fleet size, and cruise altitude covered by supersonic scenarios is larger than
  for subsonic aircraft. For a nominal cruise altitude of 19 km, the largest impacts
  of proposed supersonic aircraft occur in the stratosphere. </p>
<p>The predicted decrease of O<span class="subscript">3</span> in the stratosphere is most sensitive to emissions
  of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, oxides of sulfur (SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O), and NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. </p>
<p>
<li> For low emission indices of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> [5-10 g nitrogen dioxide (NO<span class="subscript">2</span>) kg<sup>-1</sup> fuel],
  the predicted decrease in O<span class="subscript">3</span> is dominated by emitted H<span class="subscript">2</span>O.</li>
<br>
<li> The amount of emitted sulfur dioxide (SO<span class="subscript">2</span>) is important in determining the
  magnitude of the calculated ozone decrease. The response to sulfur depends on
  how much SO<span class="subscript">2</span> is converted to sulfate particles in the aircraft exhaust plume,
  with larger depletions accompanying larger conversions. <br>
<li>The calculated change in O<span class="subscript">3</span> also depends on background sulfate surface area
  density (SAD), which is variable because of volcanic input. The computed change
  in O<span class="subscript">3</span> is not very sensitive to projected changes in chlorine loading and trace
  gases for an assumed fleet size of 500 aircraft, using a background sulfate
  SAD condition in the model simulation. <br>
<li> Changes in cruise altitude produce different results: Higher (lower) cruise
  altitudes result in larger (smaller) O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletions.
  <p>Results reported here correspond to changes in O<span class="subscript">3</span> when a supersonic fleet
    of aircraft replaces a portion of subsonic flights. The baseline computations
    assume that supersonic aircraft have a cruise altitude of 19 km, an emission
    index for water EI(H<span class="subscript">2</span>O)=1230 (1230 g H<span class="subscript">2</span>O kg<sup>-1</sup> fuel), EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5 (5 g NO<span class="subscript">2</span> kg<sup>-1</sup>
    fuel), and a range of values for EI(SO<span class="subscript">2</span>). </p>
  <p>H<span class="subscript">2</span>O-The increase in H<span class="subscript">2</span>O is calculated to be a maximum of 0.4-0.7 ppmv in
    the Northern Hemisphere mid-to high-latitude LS for a fleet of 500 aircraft,
    compared to a background of 3-4 ppmv. </p>
  <p>Total Active Nitrogen (NOy)-The increase in NOy is calculated to be a maximum
    of 0.6-1.0 ppbv in the Northern Hemisphere mid-to high-latitude LS for a fleet
    of 500 aircraft, compared to a background of 3-10 ppbv. </p>
  <p>SO<span class="subscript">2</span>-Emission and conversion of SO<span class="subscript">2</span> to sulfate particles in the plume are
    still very uncertain for supersonic aircraft; thus, we summarize a range of
    scenarios. The SAD would increase 20-100% between 15 and 20 km in the 30-90°N
    latitude band for EI(SO<span class="subscript">2</span>)=0.4 and a range of assumptions about gas to particle
    conversion in the plume. </p>
  <p>O<span class="subscript">3</span>-Each model shows different distributions of O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion and enhancement
    that probably reflect different methodologies of transport and chemistry incorporated
    in individual models. The results summarized below are from different models
    over a range of scenarios. </p>
  <p>
<li>The calculated range for Northern Hemisphere annual average total O<span class="subscript">3</span> change
  is<sup>-1</sup>.3 to 0.0% for a fleet of 500 aircraft with an EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5 in 2015 flying
  in a low background sulfate SAD stratosphere. The O<span class="subscript">3</span> change is computed to be
  more positive in a higher background sulfate SAD stratosphere.<br>
<li> The calculated range for Northern Hemisphere annual average total O<span class="subscript">3</span> change
  is<sup>-1</sup>.4 to -0.1% for a fleet of 1,000 aircraft with an EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5 in 2050. <br>
<li> Model simulations show that O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion occurs throughout most of the stratosphere,
  except in the tropical LS. Some models calculate an O<span class="subscript">3</span> increase in the lowest
  part of the mid-latitude stratosphere.
  <h3><b>Carry-Through Computations to Chapters <a href="054.htm">5</a> and <a href="063.htm">6</a>
    </b></h3>
  <p><i>Most Likely Values </i></p>
  <p>For each scenario, a single model was used to propagate changes in constituents
    in Chapters <a href="054.htm">5</a> and <a href="063.htm">6</a>.<br>
    <i>Uncertainties </i></p>
  <p>The various model computations exhibit a range of results that to some degree
    reflects uncertainties. However, this range does not define the uncertainties
    and, indeed, it is very difficult at this time to quantify them. Factors that
    contribute include the following: </p>
  <p>
<li> Deficiencies in model representation of transport processes <br>
<li> Deficiencies in model representation of chemical processes <br>
<li> Unknown or missing chemical and physical processes <br>
<li> Limited knowledge about the chemical composition of the future atmosphere
  and subsequent changes in atmospheric temperatures and winds resulting from
  climate change effects<br>
<li> Limitations in model resolution and dimensionality.
<p>Uncertainties in the computations were estimated as follows: </p>
<p><li> For the subsonic case, the uncertainty was taken to be a factor of 2, and
  was based on the differences among the various tropospheric models. The factor
  of 2 uncertainty was chosen for both the 2015 and 2050 atmospheres. This factor
  does not reflect additional uncertainties in future emissions, chemistry, and
  climate. Therefore, the confidence of the calculations is "fair" for 2015 and
  "poor" for 2050.<br>
  <li>For the supersonic case, the range of all model calculations was passed on
  as a qualitative indication of the uncertainty. The estimate of the likely uncertainty
  range is significantly larger than this model range. For example, the central
  value for the Northern Hemisphere annual average total O<span class="subscript">3</span> change is -0.8% for
  a fleet of 1,000 aircraft in 2050, with a model range of -1.4 to -0.1%. A more
  likely uncertainty range for the possible Northern Hemisphere annual average
  total O<span class="subscript">3</span> change from this supersonic fleet of aircraft is +1 to -3.5%, and a
  "fair" confidence is associated with this range.<br>
