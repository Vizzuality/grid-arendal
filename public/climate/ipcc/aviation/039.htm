<h2><b>3.5. Long-Term Changes in Observed Cloudiness and Cloud-Related Parameters</b></h2>
<p>Contrails have long been considered possible modifiers of regional climate
  (Murcray, 1970; Changnon, 1981). Contrails may increase total cloud and cirrus
  cloud amounts, and consequently change the Earth's radiation balance. As a result,
  surface and upper tropospheric temperatures may change (Detwiler, 1983; Frankel
  et al., 1997). In the following sections, we examine changes in cloudiness and
  other climate parameters for their possible relationship to aircraft operations.
  Some data indicate changes in observed cirrus cloudiness. These observations
  are used to provide a first estimate of an upper bound on the increase in contrail-cirrus
  coverage since the beginning of the jet air traffic era. Limitations in attributing
  observed trends to aircraft are discussed in <a href="039.htm#353">Section 3.5.3</a>.
</p>
<h3><i><b><a name="351"></a>3.5.1. Changes in the Occurrence and Cover of Cirrus
  Clouds </b></i></h3>
<h4><i><a name="3511"></a>3.5.1.1. Surface Observations </i></h4>
<p>Although most studies reporting trends in cloud cover have considered total
  cloud cover (Henderson-Sellers, 1989, 1992; Angell, 1990; Plantico et al., 1990;
  Karl et al., 1993), we focus here on studies reporting trends in cirrus cloud
  cover, which is more relevant to the issue of aviation effects on cloudiness.
  Observations at Hohenpeissenberg, Germany, indicate that the frequency of high
  clouds during sunny hours increased from 45% in 1954 to 70% in 1995 (Vandersee,
  1997; Winkler et al., 1997). Such large changes are not atypical of regional
  cloud climatologies (e.g., Rebetez and Beniston, 1998). Over the same period,
  global radiation during sunshine hours decreased by about 10%, indicating that
  the observed cloud trend is not an artifact. Similarly, cirrus frequency increased
  between 1964 and 1990 under cloudy-with-sun conditions by 27% over Hamburg and
  15% over Hohenpeissenberg (in northern and southern Germany, respectively) (Liepert
  et al., 1994; Liepert, 1997). These changes are not directly attributable to
  aircraft, however; instead, they might be caused by an increase in tropopause
  altitude or higher relative humidity in the upper troposphere (Winkler et al.,
  1997). Cirrus cover over Salt Lake City and Denver has increased from about
  12% annual mean cover to 20% in the period from the early 1960s (i.e., since
  the beginning of the jet aircraft era) to the 1980s, possibly because of increased
  air traffic over those cities. These trends are significantly lower in the 1990s,
  and similar observations over Chicago and San Francisco show no obvious trends
  (Liou et al., 1990; Frankel et al., 1997). </p>
<p>Global trends of observed total and cirrus cover can be deduced from ground-based
  cloud observations over land and ocean (Warren et al., 1986, 1988; Hahn et al.,
  1994, 1996) for 1971-91. For the period 1982-91, mean global trends in cirrus
  occurrence frequency were 1.7 and 6.2% per decade over land and ocean, respectively
  (Boucher, 1999). The decadal trend was 5.6% over North America and 13.3% over
  the heavy air traffic region located in the northeastern United States of America.
  The computed average change in cirrus occurrence (1987-91 relative to 1982-86)
  as a function of aviation fuel use at the observation locations is shown in
  <a href="038.htm#img318">Figure 3-18</a>. The results indicate a statistically
  significant (97% confidence level) increase in cirrus occurrence in the North
  Atlantic flight corridor compared with the rest of the North Atlantic Ocean
  (Boucher, 1998, 1999). </p>
<p>From the same source of observations, cirrus cover was analyzed for the periods
  1971-81 and 1982-91 and for a combined data set extending from 1971-92 (Minnis
  et al., 1998b). Data were averaged for gross air traffic regions (ATRs) and
  the rest of the globe. ATRs are rectangular areas on the globe that contain
  most air traffic routes and constitute 26% of the available regions with data.
  The ATR trends are larger for cirrus clouds than for total cloudiness and are
  most significant in the first period (1971-81), with the largest annual values
  found in the United States of America (3%), western Asia (1.6%), and the North
  Pacific (1.7%). No significant ATR trends were found over Europe. Changes for
  the rest of the globe were significant only over land but with values less than
  those over the United States of America and western Asia. Averaged over all
  ATRs, the cirrus cover increase between 1971 and 1981 amounts to 1.5% per decade,
  compared with 0.1% for the rest of the globe. From 1982-91, cirrus cover increased
  over all areas except over non-ATR land and North Atlantic regions, where it
  changed by -0.4 and 0%, respectively. </p>
<p>The combined 1971-92 cirrus cover data set shows somewhat different results
  from the two separate data sets. The mean trend for land was 0% per decade for
  ATRs, compared to -1.1% per decade for other land regions. Over the United States
  of America, however, the ATR trend is significant at 1.2% per decade. Over oceans,
  the mean ATR trend is 1.2% per decade and 0.6% per decade over the rest of the
  oceans. The Pacific ATR trend is strongest, at 1.5% per decade. Averaging of
  apparent trends from the two separate data sets gives results that differ from
  the mean trends in the combined data set. However, the relative difference in
  the mean trends between the ATR regions and the rest of the globe is roughly
  1.1% in both cases, indicating that cirrus coverage in areas with significant
  air traffic is increasing relative to that over the remainder of the globe.
</p>
<p>Using ground-based data sets, <a href="038.htm#img319">Figure 3-19</a> shows the
  seasonal trends in cirrus coverage over the United States of America and Europe.
  The average trend of the two separate data sets is compared with the seasonal
  cycle of contrail occurrence frequency over the United States of America and
  cover over Europe. Contrail occurrence over the United States of America was
  derived from 1 year of surface station observations (Minnis et al., 1997); contrail
  coverage over mid-Europe was computed from satellite data (Mannstein et al.,
  1999). Over the United States of America, the seasonal trends in cirrus coverage
  (statistically significant at least at the 75% confidence level) are roughly
  in phase with the seasonal cycle of contrail occurrence (see <a href="038.htm#img319">Figure
  3-19a</a>), suggesting that cirrus changes are related to contrail occurrence.
  In contrast, the seasonal cycle of cirrus cover trends for Europe does not resemble
  the seasonal cycle of contrail cover (see <a href="038.htm#img319">Figure 3-19b</a>).
  The European data, which are not statistically significant, show that the trends
  observed for the United States of America are not so obvious for other air traffic
  regions. </p>
<h4><i><a name="3512"></a>3.5.1.2. ISCCP Observations </i></h4>
<p>Data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP, C2)
  (Rossow and Schiffer, 1991) between 50°S and 70°N from 1984 to 1990 have also
  been inspected for trends in total and high cloud cover over land and ocean
  regions (Minnis et al., 1998b). The trends are similar to those found in the
  1982-91 surface observations, though details differ. Over all land areas, total
  cloudiness decreased by 0.5% per decade; high cloud cover grew at a rate of
  1.2% per decade. Over the United States of America, total cloudiness decreased
  by 2.3% per decade, but high cloud cover increased by 5.5% per decade. The trends
  over Europe were of the same sign but half the magnitude. Over Asia, total cloud
  cover increased by 4.8% per decade, and high cloudiness grew by 2.7% per decade.
  Thus, the satellite data suggest a relatively stronger increase in cirrus over
  the United States of America than surface observations suggest. Over ocean,
  total cloudiness decreased by 1.2% per decade, whereas high cloud cover was
  enhanced by 3.7% per decade overall. Some of the discrepancies between the satellite
  and surface data may originate from the different spatial sampling patterns,
  calibration, and orbit drift issues peculiar to the satellite data (Klein and
  Hartmann, 1993; Brest et al., 1997). The satellite covers all regions almost
  equally, whereas surface observations are from fixed inhabited locations or
  from well-traveled ship routes. </p>
<p>Further analysis of the ISCCP satellite and the surface data sets was undertaken
  to isolate and quantify the effects of contrails (Minnis et al., 1998b). The
  apparent trends were calculated separately for regions having a mean value of
  contrail coverage less than and greater than 0.5% as computed by Sausen et al.
  (1998) for 1992 aircraft operations (see <a href="038.htm#343">Section 3.4.3</a>).
  The mean values of the computed contrail coverage in the two regions are 0.04
  and 1.4%, respectively (<a href="038.htm#img316">Figure 3-16</a>). Satellite data
  and surface observations show larger increases in cirrus cloudiness where contrails
  are expected to occur most frequently than in all other areas (<a href="038.htm#tab35">Table
  3-5</a>). Satellite data show that, over land, the increase in high cloudiness
  in contrail regions was almost four times that in other areas. Over ocean, the
  difference, though less significant statistically, amounts to a differential
  increase of 1.6% cover per decade in contrail areas with respect to non-contrail
  areas. Cirrus trends over contrail regions as derived from surface observations
  are 0.8 to 2.3% per decade greater than those in the remainder of the globe
  for the two periods from 1971-92. The single 1971-92 surface data set shows
  a significant increase (1.6%) in cirrus over land contrail regions compared
  to remaining land areas. Over oceans, the relative difference is negative but
  insignificant because of the small number of samples and large variance. Although
  the differences in these trends are significant at confidence levels of 95%
  only for the land and global ISCCP data and the 1971-81 land surface data, they
  show consistent tendencies. </p>
<h4><i><a name="3513"></a>3.5.1.3. HIRS Observations </i></h4>
<p>High-Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) data from NOAA satellites
  have been analyzed for the period June 1989 to February 1997 to determine total
  and high cloud cover (Wylie and Menzel, 1999). During this period, high clouds
  observed by the NOAA-10 and -12 satellites increased by 4-5% over land and ocean
  in the Northern Hemisphere (from 23 to 65°N) but only by about 2% in the tropics.
  High clouds increased by about 3% over southern mid-latitude oceans. The trend
  values inferred from the NOAA-11 and -14 satellites are different and somewhat
  more uncertain because of orbit drift. Over oceans, they also indicate a larger
  high cloud increase in northern mid-latitudes (3.3%) than over the tropics (-0.4%).
  Further analysis of HIRS data is required to determine the extent of any contrail
  impact. </p>
<h4><i><a name="3514"></a>3.5.1.4. SAGE Observations </i></h4>
<p>Data from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) II satellite
  instrument indicate that the frequency of subvisible cirrus clouds near 45°N
  is twice that at 45°S (Wang et al., 1996). Aviation, as well as hemispheric
  differences in atmospheric conditions and background aerosol (Chiou et al.,
  1997; Rosen et al., 1997), may contribute to such differences (Sausen et al.,
  1998). </p>
<h4> <i><a name="3515"></a>3.5.1.5. Upper Bound for Aviation-Induced Changes in
  Cirrus Clouds </i></h4>
<p>The line-shaped contrail cover and global extrapolation described in <a href="038.htm#343">Section
  3.4.3</a> (see <a href="038.htm#img316">Figure 3-16</a>; Sausen et al., 1998) provide
  only a lower bound for aviation-induced changes in cirrus cloud cover because
  they are based on satellite observations that identify only contrails and additional
  cirrus clouds that are line-shaped. Although estimates of an upper bound of
  aviation-induced cirrus cover have not yet been established, evidence for a
  correlation of long-term increases in cirrus cloudiness with air traffic has
  been published (Liou et al., 1990; Frankel et al., 1997; Boucher, 1998, 1999).
  Here, observations of cloudiness changes described above are used to provide
  a preliminary estimate of this upper bound. </p>
<p>Differences in trends derived from observations indicate a stronger mean increase
  of cirrus amounts in regions with large computed contrail cover than in regions
  with low computed contrail cover, at least over land (see <a href="038.htm#tab35">Table
  3-5</a>). The trend difference values vary and are of different statistical
  significances. The values are considered more meaningful over land because there
  is less air traffic over the oceans. Of regions with large computed contrail
  cover, only 14% occurs over oceans, and most of these regions occur near the
  coasts. In addition, less correlation is expected between computed and observable
  contrail cover over oceans because actual flight tracks often deviate significantly
  from idealized great-circle routes. Over land, surface-based observations for
  1971-81 suggest a differential increase in cirrus cover of 2.3% per decade.
  The 1982-91 trend difference is smaller but still positive, and the combined
  22-year trend difference is 1.6% per decade. The 7 years of ISCCP satellite
  data suggest even larger trend differences, both globally and over land. If
  a trend difference of 1.6% per decade is adopted as most representative of available
  data, and if that trend is assumed to have persisted for the 3 decades since
  the beginning of the jet aircraft era (the end of the 1960s), then the current
  increase in cirrus coverage from aircraft is 4.8% in areas with contrail cover
  greater than 0.5%. This value is about three times the currently computed linear-contrail
  cover of 1.4% in those areas and is equivalent to about 0.3% coverage of the
  Earth's surface, 0.2% more than for line-shaped contrails. If no counteracting
  process took place that reduced cloudiness over this same period, this value
  gives an upper bound for total aviation-induced cloudiness. </p>
<h3><i><b><a name="352"></a>3.5.2. Changes in Other Climate Parameters </b></i></h3>
<h4><i><a name="3521"></a>3.5.2.1. Sunshine Duration and Surface Radiation </i></h4>
<p>Observations from 100 stations over the United States of America showed that
  the mean value for total cloud cover over the years 1970-88 increased by 2.0
  ± 1.3% relative to the years 1950-68 (Angell, 1990). Sunshine duration decreased
  by only 0.8 ± 1.2%, presumably because cirrus clouds are often too thin to reduce
  measured sunshine duration. Sunshine duration decreased by an average of 3.7%
  per decade over Germany between 1953 and 1989 (Liepert et al., 1994). Contrails
  were estimated to be insufficient to account for the diminished sunshine. In
  an analysis of radiation trends in Germany from 1964 to 1990, solar radiation
  during cloudy periods with sun decreased strongly (by 20 to 80 W m<sup>-2</sup>) (Liepert,
  1997). The change might be attributable to aircraft, but the strong reduction
  in diffuse radiation revealed a more turbid atmosphere, which cannot be explained
  by increasing cirrus coverage alone. </p>
<h4><i><a name="3522"></a>3.5.2.2. Temperature </i></h4>
<p>A substantial decrease in diurnal surface temperature range (DTR) has been
  observed on all continents (Karl et al., 1984; Rebetez and Beniston, 1998).
  The reasons for this decrease are not clear; it could be caused by a change
  in aerosol burden, cloud amount, cloud ceiling height (Hansen et al., 1995),
  soil moisture, or absorption of solar radiation by increased water vapor in
  the atmosphere (Roeckner et al., 1998). A weak correlation was found between
  contrail occurrence data and DTR over the United States of America (DeGrand
  et al., 1990; Travis and Changnon, 1997). The relationship was strongest during
  the summer and autumn and most significant over the southwestern United States
  of America. Rebetez and Beniston (1998) find large DTR trends in the Swiss Alps
  (a region with heavy air traffic) in correlation with low-level clouds but no
  reduction of DTR at higher elevation sites, contradicting a potential major
  impact on DTR from aviation-induced cirrus. </p>
<p>From data taken between 1901 and 1977 over the midwestern United States of
  America, increases of moderated temperatures (below average maximum and above
  average minimum), decreases in sunshine and clear days, and shifts in cloud
  cover, occurred after 1960; these changes were concentrated in the main east-west
  air corridor (Changnon, 1981). There are, however, many reasons for changes
  in global mean surface temperatures since 1880 (Halpert and Bell, 1997). The
  maximum increase in tropospheric temperatures occurred at northern mid-latitudes
  in the lower troposphere (Tett et al., 1996; Parker et al., 1997). However,
  radiative transfer models predict maximum heating rates right below contrails
  and cirrus in the upper troposphere (Liou, 1986; <a href="040.htm">Section 3.6</a>).
  Studies using a full-feedback global circulation model (GCM) indicate a nearly
  constant increase in temperature with altitude for an increase in thin cirrus
  cloudiness (Hansen et al., 1997). Thus, existing studies do not support the
  conclusion that aircraft-induced contrails and cloudiness caused changes in
  global tropospheric temperatures. </p>
<h3><i><b><a name="353"></a>3.5.3. Limitations in Observed Climate Changes </b></i></h3>
<p>The observations cited above suggest that some of the apparent trends in observed
  cirrus cloudiness and sunshine duration may be caused by air traffic. However,
  any observed change in cirrus cloudiness or climatic conditions may have other
  natural or anthropogenic causes (IPCC, 1996). Natural variability includes the
  El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and
  the Pacific North America pattern (PNA). For example, the NAO index increased
  overall from the mid-1960s until 1995 (Hurrell, 1995; Halpert and Bell, 1997).
  However, there is no evident trend in the NAO index (Hurrell, 1995) and mean
  position of the Iceland low (Kapala et al., 1998; Mächel et al., 1998) over
  the period 1982-91 when significant increases in cirrus occurrence and cirrus
  amount were observed over the North Atlantic Ocean (Boucher, 1998, 1999). Changes
  in cirrus and subsequent changes in sunshine duration may reflect changes in
  cyclonic activity (Weber, 1990), ocean surface temperature and related atmospheric
  dynamics (Wallace et al., 1995), upper troposphere temperature and relative
  humidity, tropopause altitude (Hoinka, 1998; Steinbrecht et al., 1998), or volcanic
  effects (Minnis et al., 1993)-or they may be a result of global climate change
  caused by increased greenhouse gases. Changes in anthropogenic or natural emissions
  of aerosol or aerosol precursors at the ground might also influence cirrus cloud
  formation (Plantico et al., 1990; Hansen et al., 1996; Hasselmann, 1997). Cirrus
  trend values deduced from surface observations may also be influenced by a variety
  of issues. For example, reported cirrus frequencies depend in an unknown manner
  on how observers classify contrails as cirrus. Reliable cloud observations are
  obtained mainly during daytime periods (Hahn et al., 1995), which do not always
  correlate with the main air traffic periods. The significance of the statistical
  relationship between cloud changes and air traffic is limited because of the
  limited duration of satellite and surface cloud observations and the brief period
  of aircraft emissions in comparison to long-term climate variations. Thus, existing
  studies are not complete enough to conclude that aircraft-induced contrails
  and cloudiness have caused observable changes in surface and tropospheric temperatures
  or other climate parameters. </p>
