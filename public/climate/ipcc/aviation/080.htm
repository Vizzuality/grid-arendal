<h3>6.4.4. Future Scenarios</h3>
<p>Direct RF from sulfate and BC in the future is obtained by scaling the best
  values for 1992 to future fuel use (see <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table 6-1</a>).
  By 2050, it is projected to increase by factors of about 2-5 for F-type scenarios
  and 7-10 for E-type scenarios. Atmospheric levels of aircraft sulfate and BC
  are assumed to respond instantaneously to fuel burn. RF values for these future
  scenarios given in <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table 6-1</a>. For the central FESGa
  (tech1) 2050 scenario, RF(sulfate) is estimated to be -0.009 (-0.003 to -0.027)
  W m<font size="-1">-2</font>, and RF(BC) is estimated to be +0.009 (+0.003 to
  +0.027) W m<font size="-1">-2</font>. The magnitude of radiative forcing for
  sulfate and BC aerosol from subsonic aircraft appears to cancel, but this appearance
  is deceptive because EI(S) and EI(BC) are highly uncertain for the future fleet
  and are not coupled. For the range of scenarios listed in <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table
  6-1</a>, each of these RFs remains smaller than the RF from CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>,
  O<font size="-2">3</font>, or persistent contrails; these effects still need
  to be considered, however, especially in the upper limits of the uncertainty
  range. </p>
<p>We do not evaluate here the climate impact of sulfate and BC aerosols from
  the projected HSCT fleet (scenario Fa1H). Sulfate released near 20 km would
  augment the natural Junge layer, adding about 25% to total mass and a smaller
  fraction to reflectivity (see discussion in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>).
  These numbers depend on the sulfur content of HSCT fuel. BC aerosols released
  from HSCT aircraft would primarily heat the stratosphere and may lead to a small
  negative value of RF after stratospheric adjustment. Still, the EI(S) and EI(BC)
  from yet-to-be-developed HSCT aircraft are highly uncertain but are likely to
  be much smaller than other HSCT-induced RF. </p>
<p>If RF from contrails of +0.02 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> in 1992 (see <a href="040.htm">Section
  3.6</a>) scales with fuel burn, it would increase to +0.06 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>
  by the year 2050 (Fa1). However, contrails are expected to increase more rapidly
  than global aviation fuel consumption as a consequence of a number a factors:
  Air traffic is expected to increase mainly in the upper troposphere, where contrails
  form preferentially; newer, more efficient engine/airframes will travel greater
  distances with the same amount of fuel, but larger wide-body aircraft carry
  more passengers and burn more fuel for the same distance; and more efficient
  aircraft can trigger contrails at higher atmospheric temperatures, hence at
  a larger range of altitudes (see discussion in <a href="041.htm">Section 3.7</a>
  and Gierens et al., 1999). Thus, global mean RF for persistent contrails is
  predicted to be larger by an additional factor of 1.6 (+0.10 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>).
  Technology option 2 (scenario Fa2) does not increase contrail RF because the
  same distances are flown although the fuel burned is greater. </p>
<p>The radiative forcing from aircraft-induced cirrus clouds in 2050 is even more
  uncertain than for 1992 (<a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a>). An estimate could
  fall between 0 and 0.16 W m<sup>-2</sup> for the 2050 FESGa (tech1) scenario.</p>
<p>Persistent contrails in the stratosphere are not likely because of the low
  ambient relative humidity. Radiative forcing from contrails from the proposed
  HSCT fleet may therefore be neglected in future scenarios of radiative forcing
  (except for the 11% reduction of subsonic RF from air traffic displaced by HSCT
  aircraft).</p>
<h3>6.4.5. Uncertainties<a name="645"></a></h3>
<p>It is difficult to constrain the direct and indirect climate effects of aerosols
  from aircraft. Measurements at altitude are not adequate to define the aircraft
  contribution today, so models representing emissions and subsequent chemical
  and physical transformations have adopted differing parameterizations to estimate
  atmospheric concentrations. Furthermore, different aerosol size distributions,
  the hygroscopic nature of some of the aerosol constituents, and mixing of different
  species of aerosol all lead to uncertainties in the radiative properties of
  aerosols. These uncertainties in the burden and radiative properties of aerosols
  emitted by aircraft lead to associated uncertainties in radiative forcing that
  are much larger than for a well-mixed, directly emitted greenhouse gas such
  as carbon dioxide. </p>
<p>RF from aircraft emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols can be constrained
  when the amount of radiatively important species is directly limited by emissions
  (e.g., CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>, H<font size="-2">2</font>O, sulfate, BC).
  However, it is more difficult to place upper limits on RF when the climate impact
  occurs indirectly, as in aircraft NO<font size="-2">x</font> production of O<font size="-2">3</font>
  or-specifically here-in perturbations to naturally occurring clouds by aircraft
  aerosols. </p>
<p>The indirect effect of aerosols from aircraft emissions on naturally occurring
  clouds cannot be quantified at present owing to the complexity of several processes
  such as ice-cloud nucleation and the dependence of albedo and emissivity on
  the size of the ice crystals. With our present knowledge, this uncertainty must
  be considered significant. Radiative forcing from contrails is estimated to
  grow disproportionately with fuel use, and extrapolation to large values in
  2050 is an important uncertainty in the future radiative impact of aviation.
  Further uncertainty arises from the fact that all estimates of contrail RF were
  made for the present climate, hence do not account for future climate change
  (see discussion in <a href="041.htm#371">Section 3.7.1</a>). </p>
