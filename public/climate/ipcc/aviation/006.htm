<p>The summary of radiative effects resulting from aircraft engine emissions is
  given in <a href="006.htm#spmfig2a">Figures 2</a> and <a href="008.htm#spmfig3">3</a>.
  As shown in <a href="006.htm#spmfig2a">Figure 2</a>, the uncertainty associated
  with several of these effects is large. </p>
<H2>4.1. Carbon Dioxide<a name="spm41"></a></H2>
<p><i>Emissions of carbon dioxide by aircraft were 0.14 Gt C/year in 1992. This
  is about 2% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in 1992 or about
  13% of carbon dioxide emissions from all transportation sources. The range of
  scenarios considered here projects that aircraft emissions of carbon dioxide
  will continue to grow and by 2050 will be 0.23 to 1.45 Gt C/year. For the reference
  scenario (Fa1) this emission increases 3-fold by 2050 to 0.40 Gt C/year, or
  3% of the projected total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions relative to
  the mid-range IPCC emission scenario (IS92a). For the range of scenarios, the
  range of increase in carbon dioxide emissions to 2050 would be 1.6 to 10 times
  the value in 1992. </i></p>
<p>Concentrations of and radiative forcing from carbon dioxide today are those
  resulting from emissions during the last 100 years or so. The carbon dioxide
  concentration attributable to aviation in the 1992 atmosphere is 1 ppmv, a little
  more than 1% of the total anthropogenic increase. This percentage is lower than
  the percentage for emissions (2%) because the emissions occurred only in the
  last 50 years. For the range of scenarios in <a href="006.htm#spmfig1">Figure 1</a>, the accumulation of atmospheric
  carbon dioxide due to aircraft over the next 50 years is projected to increase
  to 5 to 13 ppmv. For the reference scenario (Fa1) this is 4% of that from all
  human activities assuming the mid-range IPCC scenario (IS92a). </p>
<H2>4.2. Ozone<a name="spm42"></a></H2>
<p><i>The NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from subsonic aircraft in 1992 are estimated to have increased
  ozone concentrations at cruise altitudes in northern mid-latitudes by up to
  6%, compared to an atmosphere without aircraft emissions. This ozone increase
  is projected to rise to about 13% by 2050 in the reference scenario (Fa1). The
  impact on ozone concentrations in other regions of the world is substantially
  less. These increases will, on average, tend to warm the surface of the Earth.</i>
</p>
<p>Aircraft emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> are more effective at producing ozone in the upper
  troposphere than an equivalent amount of emission at the surface. Also increases
  in ozone in the upper troposphere are more effective at increasing radiative
  forcing than increases at lower altitudes. Due to these increases the calculated
  total ozone column in northern mid-latitudes is projected to grow by approximately
  0.4 and 1.2% in 1992 and 2050, respectively. However, aircraft sulfur and water
  emissions in the </p>
<p>stratosphere tend to deplete ozone, partially offsetting the NO<span class="subscript">x</span>-induced ozone
  increases. The degree to which this occurs is, as yet, not quantified. Therefore,
  the impact of subsonic aircraft emissions on stratospheric ozone requires further
  evaluation. The largest increases in ozone concentration due to aircraft emissions
  are calculated to occur near the tropopause where natural variability is high.
  Such changes are not apparent from observations at this time. </p>
<H2>4.3. Methane<a name="spm43"></a></H2>
<p><i>In addition to increasing tropospheric ozone concentrations, aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  emissions are expected to decrease the concentration of methane, which is also
  a greenhouse gas. These reductions in methane tend to cool the surface of the
  Earth. The methane concentration in 1992 is estimated here to be about 2% less
  than that in an atmosphere without aircraft.</i></p>
<p>This aircraft-induced reduction of methane concentration is much smaller than
  the observed overall 2.5-fold increase since pre-industrial times. Uncertainties
  in the sources and sinks of methane preclude testing the impact of aviation
  on methane concentrations with atmospheric observations. In the reference scenario
  (Fa1) methane would be about 5% less than that calculated for a 2050 atmosphere
  without aircraft.</p>
<p>Changes in tropospheric ozone are mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, while
  those of methane are global in extent so that, even though the global average
  radiative forcings are of similar magnitude and opposite in sign, the latitudinal
  structure of the forcing is different so that the net regional radiative effects
  do not cancel. </p>

      aircraft emissions in 1992 (2a) and in 2050 for scenario Fa1 (2b). The scale
      in <a href="006.htm#spmfig2b">Figure 2b</a> is greater than the scale in <a href="006.htm#spmfig2a">2a</a> by about a factor of 4. The
      bars indicate the best estimate of forcing while the line associated with
      each bar is a two-thirds uncertainty range developed using the best knowledge
      and tools available at the present time. (The two-thirds uncertainty range
      means that there is a 67% probability that the true value falls within this
      range.) The available information on cirrus clouds is insufficient to determine
      either a best estimate or an uncertainty range; the dashed line indicates
      a range of possible best estimates. The estimate for total forcing does
      not include the effect of changes in cirrus cloudiness. The uncertainty
      estimate for the total radiative forcing (without additional cirrus) is
      calculated as the square root of the sums of the squares of the upper and
      lower ranges for the individual components. The evaluations below the graph
      ("good," "fair," "poor," "very poor") are a relative appraisal associated
      with each component and indicates the level of scientific understanding.
      It is based on the amount of evidence available to support the best estimate
      and its uncertainty, the degree of consensus in the scientific literature,
      and the scope of the analysis. This evaluation is separate from the evaluation
      of uncertainty range represented by the lines associated with each bar.
      This method of presentation is different and more meaningful than the confidence
      level presented in similar graphs from Climate Change 1995: The Science
      of Climate Change.</i></td>
