<h3><b>2.2.2. Observing Changes in Atmospheric Ozone from Present Aviation</b></h3>
<h4> <i><a name="2221"></a>2.2.2.1. Observed Ozone Trends in the Upper Troposphere
  and Lower Stratosphere</i></h4>
<p>A decreasing trend in stratospheric ozone has been a pivotal diagnostic in
  the assessment of anthropogenic halocarbon release. Because the bulk of global
  ozone resides in the stratosphere, measurements of total column ozone-which
  can be made quite accurately-have served as a proxy for stratospheric ozone
  abundance. Downward trends in total ozone are now well-established throughout
  all seasons and all latitudes, except in the tropics (WMO-UNEP, 1999). Broad
  agreement on the magnitude of the total ozone trend exists between ground-based
  and satellite observational databases and model predictions based on chlorine-catalyzed
  ozone destruction. However, as discussed in <a href="022.htm">Section 2.1</a>,
  aircraft engine emissions may induce changes of different magnitude and/or sign
  in tropospheric and stratospheric ozone densities. Therefore, to observe possible
  effects of aviation on the ozone layer, one is likely to have to focus on trends
  in the vertical ozone profile rather than overall column abundance. </p>
<p>Natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and seasonal and interannual climate
  variations may affect ozone density variations in the UT and LS. The time constants
  associated with these phenomena range from months (in the case of short-term
  climate variation) to years (for the occasional volcanic eruption) to possibly
  decades (for long-term climate change). Because extensive observational data
  on ozone are limited to the past several decades, it is not possible to completely
  deconvolute the impacts of various natural phenomena. The data record is sufficiently
  long, however, to allow characterization of periodic phenomena occuring on shorter
  time scales. Most of the anthropogenic forcings have been increasing secularly
  during the period of observation. Consequently, attempts to discriminate trend
  components can be carried out only with the aid of model predictions for each
  forcing. </p>
<p>Trend analyses of vertical ozone profiles have become possible only during
  the 1980s and 1990s as a result of data from the ground-based (Umkehr technique)
  and ozonesonde networks, and satellite-borne solar backscatter ultraviolet spectrometer
  (SBUV) and Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) I/II instruments
  (Logan, 1994; Miller et al.,1995; WMO-UNEP, 1995; Fortuin and Kelder, 1997;
  Harris et al., 1997; WMO, 1998; see also <a href="026.htm#img24">Figure 2-4</a>).
  The middle stratospheric trends derived from different data sets show broad
  agreement with each other. The negative trend peaking at ~40-km altitude and
  extending from 30 to 50 km in middle latitudes is ascribed to the simple Cl-ClO
  catalytic cycle of ozone destruction from enhanced atmospheric chlorine loading.
  A significant negative trend is also discerned in the lowermost stratosphere
  (i.e., between the troposphere and approximately 20-km altitude), where increased
  heterogeneous conversion of chlorine-containing reservoir species to reactive
  radical forms has been suggested as a factor in ozone destruction through catalytic
  cycles involving the ClO+ClO and ClO+BrO reactions. </p>

<p>Trends in UT ozone for the time period encompassing large growth in aircraft
  fuel consumption (1970 to the present) are available from a number of ozonesonde
  stations. All of the sonde stations at middle and high latitudes of the Northern
  Hemisphere show a stratospheric decrease at altitudes between the tropopause
  and ~24 km for the period 1970-96. Upper tropospheric trends vary substantially
  among stations, with increases of 10-20%/decade over Europe, decreases of 5-10%/decade
  over Canada and the eastern United States, and no trend over Japan (WMO-UNEP,
  1999). Neither aircraft nor surface NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions-both showing little geographical
  variation in their European, North American, and Asian trends (Logan, 1994)-are
  consistent with observed ozone trend variations. </p>
<p>Detailed time-series analysis of ozone trend data in an area of heavy aircraft
  traffic (i.e., west-central Europe) reveals that air traffic growth is unlikely
  to be a primary factor in the observed upper tropospheric trend. For example,
  the sonde observations at Hohenpeissenberg, Germany, clearly show a mean increase
  in ozone of ~10%/decade below ~9-km altitude between 1970-96 (<a href="026.htm#img25">Figure
  2-5</a>). However, most of the increase occurred before 1985 (WMO-UNEP, 1999),
  even though air traffic growth remained steady, and the ozone trend for the
  period 1980-96 is slightly negative in the UT. The lack of growth in ozone after
  1985 mimics the lack of growth of surface emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> (Logan, 1994). Decreases
  in the amount of ozone transported to the UT from the LS, because of reductions
  in stratospheric ozone abundance and/or weakening of dynamical transport, may
  also be a factor in the observed trend during the 1980s and 1990s. </p>
<p><i>In situ</i> aircraft sampling of ozone in the 9-13 km region that has occurred
  sporadically over the past 20 years provides complementary data sets for use
  in understanding ozone climatology in the tropopause region. In 1994, a focused
  effort to collect climatological ozone data from aircraft platforms was initiated
  as the MOZAIC program (Marenco et al., 1999; Thouret et al., 1999). This database
  is now sufficiently long to address a number of important issues related to
  tropopause heights and seasonal variations, although it cannot yet address the
  issue of long-term trends. </p>
<h4><i><a name="2222"></a>2.2.2.2. Other Diagnostics of Large-Scale Aviation Impacts</i></h4>
<p>As discussed in previous sections, ambient levels of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and soot are likely
  to be affected by aircraft to a greater extent than ozone. Accordingly, a comprehensive
  set of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and aerosol measurements taken over a wide range of locations and
  over the period of the past 20 years could provide a basis for evaluating aircraft
  impacts on these ozone-related species. Compared to the historical record for
  ozone, however, the available information on NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and aerosol is sparser and
  was obtained only by in situ sampling from aircraft and balloons (Hofmann, 1993;
  Blake and Kato, 1995; Emmons et al., 1997). Satellite data are available for
  lower stratospheric aerosol, but the data record is relatively short and heavily
  influenced by recent volcanic eruptions. Analysis of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and aerosol trends
  would be exceedingly difficult to interpret because the aircraft source would
  be convolved with many other increasing sources of anthropogenic NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and aerosol.
  In addition, the high degree of air mass variability in the troposphere places
  severe constraints on the atmospheric sampling strategy one would have to adopt
  to collect representative data. </p>
<p>In principle, aircraft signatures could be discerned from observation of the 
  distribution of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> because the aircraft source 
  is geographically distinct. In situ aircraft sampling efforts have begun to 
  provide a global map of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the UT (Emmons 
  et al., 1997; see also <a href="027.htm#img26">Figure 2-6a</a>). During the 
  past few years, field campaigns have been performed specifically to investigate 
  aircraft flight corridors. For example, observations in air traffic have been 
  made by Schlager et al. (1996, 1997). The observation area was the major flight 
  route in the eastern North Atlantic, and the parameters observed were NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, 
  SO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and particles; observations were made perpendicular 
  to flight tracks. Under special meteorological conditions associated with a 
  stagnant anticyclone, measured data indicated a large-scale accumulation of 
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and particles from aircraft emissions. </p>
<p>Approximately 4,000 hours of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> measurements were collected from a B-747 platform
  during the Nitrogen Oxides and ozone measurements along Air Routes (NO<span class="subscript">x</span>AR) project
  between spring 1995 and spring 1996, as shown in <a href="027.htm#img26">Figure
  2-6b</a> (Brunner, 1998). The NO<span class="subscript">x</span>AR measurements demonstrated that, in addition
  to aircraft emissions, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> produced by lightning and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emitted at the surface
  and transported upward by convection make large contributions to the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> abundance
  in the UT. These contributions were largest over and downstream of continents
  in summer. Finally, the recently completed SONEX and POLINAT II campaigns were
  designed specifically to quantify various NO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources in the UT. The findings
  of these latest studies are just now being reported. </p>
