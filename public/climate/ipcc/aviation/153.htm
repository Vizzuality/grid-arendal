<!-- #BeginEditable "Page_Content_Here" --> <h2>10.4. Mitigation Measures </h2>
<p>Aviation is a technologically intensive industry, both as a user and as a driver
  of advanced technology. Until quite recently, business units within the air
  service industry were often characterized as a series of local monopolies connected
  by a set of protected routes, which contributed to economic and environmental
  inefficiencies. Continued aviation liberalization has not brought decreased
  regulation in the areas of safety, security, and the environment however, and
  continued cooperation among national authorities is necessary to ensure that
  such regulations are globally and competitively neutral. </p>
<h3><a name="1041"></a>10.4.1. Underlying Trends Relevant to Mitigation </h3>
<p>The general trend in aircraft engine technology development over the past few
  decades has been to reduce specific fuel consumption (SFC). This trend has resulted
  in lower emissions of carbon dioxide CO<span class="subscript">2</span>) and water vapor (H<span class="subscript">2</span>O) and most other
  exhaust gases per unit of thrust. Advances in combustor technology have resulted
  in considerable reduction of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions at a given pressure ratio. Future
  developments in engine technology are discussed in <a href="088.htm">Chapter
  7</a>. </p>
<p>Developments in communication, navigation, and surveillance technology, as
  well as air traffic management systems (see <a href="118.htm">Chapter 8</a>),
  have enabled more efficient use of the air traffic system. This trend has resulted
  in considerable fuel savings. The complete transformation-that is, modernization
  of the air traffic system-is expected to generate significant safety, operational,
  and environmental benefits. Air traffic measures for present and future systems
  offer potential for reduced fuel consumption, hence emissions, through improvement
  in the overall capacity and efficiency of the air traffic system. Potential
  environmental benefits to be gained from operational measures within the current
  air traffic system, though important, are thought to be smaller than those that
  may be gained through modernization of the air traffic system. The environmental
  effect will depend on the rate at which these measures are adopted. </p>
<p><a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a> examines the implications of alternative growth
  and technology scenarios on aviation emissions. Mid-term projections of aviation
  growth have meaningful margins of error, and those beyond 20 years are highly
  uncertain. Accordingly, rather than use projections, we develop a range of future
  industry growth and technology scenarios to the year 2050. Comparison of scenarios
  gives order-of-magnitude estimates of emissions changes resulting from variation
  in the rate of aviation growth and different technology options. Although these
  scenarios produce a wide range of outcomes, they all show an increase in aircraft
  emissions as growth outpaces engine technology improvements. </p>
<p>The scenarios assume minimal fuel consumption resulting from the use of optimal
  fight paths and absence of delay. Unlimited development of the aviation infrastructure
  projects unconstrained growth of aviation. <a href="118.htm">Chapter 8</a> addresses
  current policies, which are expected to diminish the environmental effects of
  additional fuel consumption resulting from present air traffic management technology
  and systems. Unconstrained growth-an assumption that is not representative of
  conditions today or in the future-thereby becomes the dominant factor. Because
  the scenarios assume complete modernization of the air traffic system and no
  infrastructure constraints, growth of traffic and emissions are thought to be
  overstated in the modeling exercises. </p>
<h4><a name="10411"></a>10.4.1.1. Deregulation and Subsidies </h4>
<p>An important factor for promoting the sustainable development of aviation is
  ensuring that producers and consumers receive appropriate signals about pollution
  costs and natural resource scarcities. The focus of aviation policy over the
  past 15 years has begun to shift from command-and-control policies to enhancing
  efficiency and responding to changing demand patterns. Two broad categories
  of issues-the operation of markets, and government supports and ownership-bear
  on environmental mitigation measures (OECD, 1997b). </p>
<p>Government regulation of competition in international aviation has restricted
  market entry and exit, fares, and capacity. Internationally, liberalization
  of bilateral air service agreements is aimed at increasing competition within
  "the home market" and promoting greater efficiency. Although aviation remains
  a quasi-protected industry in some countries, deregulation is becoming the predominant
  trend within national markets. </p>
<p>Economic deregulation of the U.S. airline industry began in 1976, and was completed
  in 1983 when all regulations on domestic fares, entry, and exit were eliminated.
  This deregulation resulted in a 33% lower fare structure and higher average
  industry load factors, which have increased from 52% (1960-69) to more than
  70% (1995-98). Following deregulation, increases in traffic volume, fuel use,
  airport and air traffic congestion, and noise that some observers consider to
  be above "normal" have been attributed to the hub-and-spoke method of operation
  that ensued. Studies comparing the effect of direct versus hub-and-spoke routing
  on fuel consumption, traffic levels, and fleet mix have not been undertaken
  (Winston, 1998). </p>
<p>When the environmental cost of a supported activity is placed outside the market
  transaction, many subsidy or tax treatments are thought to have adverse environmental
  consequences to the extent that they generate negative effects. The most important
  examples of explicit government supports to aviation are nonmarket pricing of
  infrastructure services, below-market financing, tax and depreciation preferences
  for oil, and direct government ownership. These and other issues are being studied
  (OECD, 1997b). Lack of inclusion of environmental costs is currently thought
  to be an implicit subsidy to industry and consumers. All of the mitigation measures
  discussed below internalize or include external costs to the service provider
  to some degree. An important issue for further research is whether the full
  costs of externalities can be quantified in advance.<a name="img101"></a> </p>

<h4><a name="10412"></a>10.4.1.2. Cost Structure</h4>
After 1976, costs of operation fell rapidly for U.S. operators. In real terms,
costs per revenue-tonne-km have declined more than 25%. Similar declines have
been achieved internationally. Lower passenger fares and cargo rates have paced
this reduction in costs. As a result, airline profits have remained low relative
to other industries. For the industry, airline profits are a significant source
of funds for purchasing capital assets. Timely acquisition of new technologies
has been viewed as necessary for environmental mitigation. Recent volatility in
industry profits is related primarily to short-term changes in demand and short-term
overcapacity of aircraft (Winston, 1998).
<p>Fuel cost and consumption are important to the mitigation measures discussed
  below. Examination of the historical record indicates that aviation fuel productivity
  has increased considerably. ICAO estimates that, while aggregate fuel consumption
  for the 1976-90 period grew approximately 60%, world civil air traffic (passengers,
  freight, and mail combined) increased about 150%. These figures are explained
  by an increased average load factor, a more optimal aircraft fleet mix, greater
  engine efficiency, and improved system capacity (Balashov and Smith, 1992).
  The amount of fuel consumed and fuel productivity affect airline profits and
  ticket prices.</p>
<p>Of interest to the policymaker is the effect of a change in fuel price on airline
  cost and fare structures and on passenger and cargo demand. <a href="153.htm#img101">Figure
  10-1</a> shows the percentage of total annual airline expense attributable to
  fuel cost for U.S. and world airlines over time and compares changes in this
  ratio against changes in the index of fuel prices for the United States and
  the world. Data for the figure were extracted from industry and ICAO published
  sources (ICAO, 1996b; Aerospace Industries Association of America, 1998). The
  data indicate that average fuel cost across the industry has recently represented
  about 11-15% of operating costs, but has been higher during times of high fuel
  prices (e.g., nearly 30% in the early 1980s). Further analyses of the impact
  of fuel prices on demand and industry profitability are needed. </p>
<p>Against the background of these underlying trends, the potential role of mitigation
  measures is considered in further reducing the growth of aircraft emissions
  by forcing technology, changing industry practices, and dampening growth in
  traffic. </p>
<h3><a name="1042"></a>10.4.2. Regulatory Measures </h3>
<p>Atmospheric environmental impacts associated with aviation emissions include
  greenhouse gas emissions, ozone depletion, acidification, and impact on local
  air quality. Cruise altitude (above 900 m) aircraft emissions of interest are
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, particulates and aerosols, sulfur compounds, and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O. Ground-level
  (altitude below 900 m) aircraft emissions of interest to local air quality issues
  are NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, carbon moNO<span class="subscript">x</span>ide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), and other volatile
  organic compounds. Ground-level CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions from aircraft are of interest
  because of their effects on climate. This section examines more fully two technology-based
  means for mitigating the adverse effects of aviation emissions. </p>
<h4><a name="10421"></a>10.4.2.1. Operational Means to Reduce Emissions </h4>
<p>The environmental aim of air traffic system modernization and operational measures
  is to reduce fuel consumption, hence emissions, through improvement in the overall
  efficiency of the air traffic system. For 1995, U.S. airlines reported a 79%
  "on-time" arrival rate for all domestic flights (i.e., flights arriving within
  15 minutes of schedule), including canceled flights and those with mechanical
  delays. For 1996, this figure was 75%. This decline indicates the scope of current
  congestion and delay problems (U.S. Department of Transportation, 1998). </p>
<p>U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) data show that annual system delays
  of 15 minutes or longer (as a percent of total operations) have declined steadily
  from 2.2% in 1989 to 1.2% in 1997. Over that period, 55-70% of these delays
  were caused by weather; 25-35% were caused by terminal volume and closed runways
  and taxiways (U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, 1977). FAA estimates of
  the total cost for air carrier delay (operating plus passenger time costs) grew
  from $6.5 billion in 1987 to $9.5 billion in 1994. Except for the cost of fuel,
  environmental costs were not considered (U.S. Federal Aviation Administration,
  1995). The European Organisation for Safety and Navigation (EUROCONTROL) reports
  that air traffic delays in Europe are primarily the result of national institutional
  factors, capacity overloads, and air traffic control inefficiencies. Association
  of European Airlines (AEA) data show that in 1989, the number of departures
  for short- and medium-term flights delayed by more than 15 minutes was 23.8%.
  This figure dropped to 12.7% in 1993, but has risen steadily since then: The
  rate was 19.5% in 1997 and 20.1% for the January-June 1998 period (Association
  of European Airlines, 1998). These data are consistent with EUROCONTROL data
  for the same years (EUROCONTROL, 1998). </p>
<p>ICAO air traffic system policies, plans, standards, and recommended practices
  have not been regarded as measures that might be used to achieve environmental
  gains. Studies assessing the costs and benefits of CNS/ATM modernization conclude
  that the benefits to airlines and passengers from reduced delays and fuel savings
  far outweigh the incremental costs. Recent studies have focused on estimating
  the environmental benefits of a more efficient air traffic system. These studies
  indicate that emissions from aviation may be reduced significantly. Although
  states are working within ICAO toward global modernization of the air traffic
  system, this activity has only recently been placed in the context of addressing
  environmental issues (EISG, 1995; Aylesworth, 1997; U.S. Federal Aviation Administration,
  1998a,b). </p>
<p>Studies and working papers prepared for CAEP/3 Working Group 3 (emissions)
  and the ICAO Worldwide CNS/ATM Systems Implementation Conference (see <a href="118.htm">Chapter
  8</a>) indicate that improvements to the air traffic system could reduce annual
  fuel consumption 6-12%. For the total flight regime, 94% of fuel saving would
  occur at cruise altitude and 6% below 900 m. NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reductions are estimated to
  be 10-16%. This discussion of measures for mitigation leads to the following
  conclusions: </p>
<ul>
  <p>. Potential gains from operational measures within the current air traffic
    system are much smaller than those that may be gained through modernization
    of the air traffic system.<br>
    . Although modernizing the air traffic system and improved operational measures
    are important environmental policy instruments in their own right, delayed
    or early realization of their potential would have adverse or beneficial environmental
    consequences, respectively. </p>
</ul>
<p>These conclusions have important environmental policy implications. Successful
  implementation of CNS/ATM is a daunting task that requires worldwide and regional
  collaboration and cooperation. Impediments to be overcome include restricted
  airspace, sovereignty issues, institutional development, and finance, particularly
  for developing nations and countries in transition.<a name="img102"></a> </p>

<h4><a name="10422"></a>10.4.2.2. Engine Emissions Stringency </h4>
<p>ICAO Annex 16 emission standards are certification requirements for individual
  engines (ICAO, 1993b). Because of extensive regulation of the industry to maintain
  high levels of safety and to maintain and promote competition, as well as comparatively
  long technology development and product economic lifetimes (<a href="088.htm">Chapter
  7</a>), ICAO has set limitations on emissions at their sources (stringency)
  on the basis of the best achievable technology by all manufacturers. </p>
<p>These ICAO standards define emissions levels for unburned HC, CO, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and
  smoke. They do not address aircraft emissions of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, sulfur dioxide (SO<span class="subscript">2</span>),
  or H<span class="subscript">2</span>O. Neither are there any ICAO standards for trace compounds such as particulates,
  aerosols, certain types of HC, and other nitrogen compounds. Aviation is not
  a source of nitrous oxide (N<span class="subscript">2</span>O), a greenhouse gas. ICAO Annex 16 standards are
  related to engine emissions during the LTO cycle; they do not specifically address
  engine emission levels for altitudes above 900 m (cruise), although these emissions
  are related to emissions during the LTO cycle. </p>
<p>In 1981, the ICAO Council adopted standards and recommended practices for aircraft
  engine emissions by establishing regulatory emissions maxima for engines manufactured
  after 1985. The regulatory conformance criteria for covered emissions are based
  on characteristic engine performance during the LTO phases of flight, which
  represents on average of 15% of the total flight segment. LTO cycle operating
  requirements are characterized by very low and very high power settings, which
  are not representative of aircraft performance at cruise conditions. For purposes
  of estimation, LTO cycle parameters are transformed into an emissions index
  (EI) for a given airframe-engine combination to characterize emissions under
  cruise conditions. </p>
<p>On the recommendation of CAEP/2, in 1993 the ICAO Council amended the emissions
  standards for NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, reducing permitted levels by 20% at a representative engine
  pressure ratio of 30. The certification regime follows the LTO cycle basis established
  under the original stringency standard. The CAEP/2 standard was adopted by ICAO
  member states with few, if any, exceptions as the universally recognized international
  standard for aviation. It is to be applied to all engines produced after 2000,
  to all new and derivative engines for which certification has been or is to
  be applied for after 1995, and, as a practical matter, to currently certified
  in-production engines that are to be altered to meet the standard. CAEP has
  since reviewed the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> stringency issue in light of local air quality and atmospheric
  concerns and in 1998 recommended that the standard be further reduced by 16%
  at an engine pressure ratio of 30 (ICAO, 1998a). For pressure ratios above 30,
  the slope of the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> maxima was returned to that of the 1981 standard to permit
  greater fuel efficiency and therefore greater reductions in CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, and oxides
  of sulfur (SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O). Recognizing the need to protect the asset value of the existing
  fleet, the new standard is to be applied only to new or derivative engines certified
  after 31 December 2003. In-production engines are thereby left unaffected by
  the stringency requirement. The ICAO Council is scheduled to review the proposed
  standard and recommended practice (SARP) by the first quarter of 1999. Adoption
  by the Council is expected, after which the SARP will be incorporated into ICAO
  Annex 16 for adoption by member states. Although there is a wide range of views
  concerning the scale of costs and benefits resulting from increased NO<span class="subscript">x</span> stringency,
  an analysis of the environmental benefits obtained to date under current ICAO
  engine stringency standards has not been initiated. </p>
<p>The three ICAO SARPs are shown in <a href="153.htm#img102">Figure 10-2</a> (ICAO,
  1995a). It suggests that ICAO stringency requirements have "pushed" engine emissions
  reduction technology or, at a minimum, have ensured its incorporation into new
  and derivative engine designs. The relatively wide variation in technology levels
  among individual engine types and whole engine families represented in <a href="153.htm#img102">Figure
  10-2</a> raises three important issues. For purposes of regulating aviation
  engine emissions, the first policy matter is whether use of the existing "best
  achievable" standard is preferable to the "best available" standard used for
  other industries. The second question concerns the optimal level at which the
  standard should be set to promote sustained and rapid progress on further emissions
  reduction. The third policy matter pertains to the means to evaluate tradeoffs
  concerning technical limitations in minimizing various emissions species and
  those pertaining to safety, performance, and environmental objectives, in particular
  noise control. </p>
<p>ICAO practice has inferred that the "best technology" concept has a specific
  meaning for aviation. The airworthiness concern is that setting standards based
  on unproved, anticipated, or nonexistent technology might result in untenable
  solutions, as might requirements that all engines meet a single, extremely low
  emissions threshold. A matter yet to be addressed is that selection of a "best
  available" technology or technology level for aircraft engines has inherent
  competition and market structure implications. Accordingly, as part of the work
  program adopted at CAEP/4, members called for looking into "establishing long-term
  and forward-looking CAEP goals for aircraft emission reductions" to meet the
  industry need for extended planning horizons while more aggressively "pushing"
  technology development (ICAO, 1998a). </p>
<p>ICAO certification standards are being regarded as a means for reducing overall
  emissions levels. Since CAEP/4, work has begun on developing parameters for
  aircraft emissions certification during climb and cruise phases of flight (above
  900 m) to complement the existing LTO-based standard. </p>
