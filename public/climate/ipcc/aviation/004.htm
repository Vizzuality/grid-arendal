<h1> 1. Introduction</h1>
<p><i>This report assesses the effects of aircraft on climate and atmospheric
  ozone and is the first IPCC report for a specific industrial subsector. It was
  prepared by IPCC in collaboration with the Scientific Assessment Panel to the
  Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, in response to
  a request by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
<sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(1,1); return false;">1</a></small></sup>
  because of the potential impact of aviation emissions. These are the predominant
  anthropogenic emissions deposited directly into the upper troposphere and lower
  stratosphere. </i></p>
<p>Aviation has experienced rapid expansion as the world economy has grown. Passenger
  traffic (expressed as revenue passenger-kilometers <sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(1,2); return false;">2</a></small></sup>
  ) has grown since 1960 at nearly 9% per year, 2.4 times the average Gross Domestic
  Product (GDP) growth rate. Freight traffic, approximately 80% of which is carried
  by passenger airplanes, has also grown over the same time period. The rate of
  growth of passenger traffic has slowed to about 5% in 1997 as the industry is
  maturing. Total aviation emissions have increased, because increased demand
  for air transport has outpaced the reductions in specific emissions
<sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#3" onClick="showFootnote(1,3); return false;">3</a></small></sup>
  from the continuing improvements in technology and operational procedures. Passenger
  traffic, assuming unconstrained demand, is projected to grow at rates in excess
  of GDP for the period assessed in this report.</p>
<p>The effects of current aviation and of a range of unconstrained growth projections
  for aviation (which include passenger, freight, and military) are examined in
  this report, including the possible effects of a fleet of second generation,
  commercial supersonic aircraft. The report also describes current aircraft technology,
  operating procedures, and options for mitigating aviation's future impact on
  the global atmosphere. The report does not consider the local environmental
  effects of aircraft engine emissions or any of the indirect environmental effects
  of aviation operations such as energy usage by ground transportation at airports.
</p>
<br>
<H2>2. How Do Aircraft Affect Climate and Ozone? <a name="spm<sup>2</sup>"></a></H2>
<p><i>Aircraft emit gases and particles directly into the upper troposphere and
  lower stratosphere where they have an impact on atmospheric composition. These
  gases and particles alter the concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases,
  including carbon dioxide CO<span class="subscript">2</span>), ozone (O<span class="subscript">3</span>), and methane (CH<span class="subscript">4</span>); trigger formation
  of condensation trails (contrails); and may increase cirrus cloudiness-all of
  which contribute to climate change (see Box 1). </i></p>
<p>The principal emissions of aircraft include the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide
  and water vapor (H<span class="subscript">2</span>O). Other major emissions are nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen
  dioxide (NO<span class="subscript">2</span>) (which together are termed NO<span class="subscript">x</span>), sulfur oxides (SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O), and soot.
  The total amount of aviation fuel burned, as well as the total emissions of
  carbon dioxide, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and water vapor by aircraft, are well known relative to
  other parameters important to this assessment. The climate impacts of the gases
  and particles emitted and formed as a result of aviation are more difficult
  to quantify than the emissions; however, they can be compared to each other
  and to climate effects from other sectors by using the concept of radiative
  forcing.
<sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#4" onClick="showFootnote(1,4); return false;">4</a></small></sup>
  Because carbon dioxide has a long atmospheric residence time (ª100 years) and
  so becomes well mixed throughout the atmosphere, the effects of its emissions
  from aircraft are indistinguishable from the same quantity of carbon dioxide
  emitted by any other source. The other gases (e.g., NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O, water vapor) and
  particles have shorter atmospheric residence times and remain concentrated near
  flight routes, mainly in the northern mid-latitudes. These emissions can lead
  to radiative forcing that is regionally located near the flight routes for some
  components (e.g., ozone and contrails) in contrast to emissions that are globally
  mixed (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane). </p>
<p>The global mean climate change is reasonably well represented by the global
  average radiative forcing, for example, when evaluating the contributions of
  aviation to the rise in globally averaged temperature or sea level. However,
  because some of aviation's key contributions to radiative forcing are located
  mainly in the northern mid-latitudes, the regional climate response may differ
  from that derived from a global mean radiative forcing. The impact of aircraft
  on regional climate could be important, but has not been assessed in this report.
</p>
<p>Ozone is a greenhouse gas. It also shields the surface of the earth from harmful
  ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and is a common air pollutant. Aircraft-emitted
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> participates in ozone chemistry. Subsonic aircraft fly in the upper troposphere
  and lower stratosphere (at altitudes of about 9 to 13 km), whereas supersonic
  aircraft cruise several kilometers higher (at about 17 to 20 km) in the stratosphere.
  Ozone in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere is expected to increase
  in response to NO<span class="subscript">x</span> increases and methane is expected to decrease. At higher
  altitudes, increases in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> lead to decreases in the stratospheric ozone layer.
  Ozone precursor (NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) residence times in these regions increase with altitude,
  and hence perturbations to ozone by aircraft depend on the altitude of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> injection
  and vary from regional in scale in the troposphere to global in scale in the
  stratosphere. </p>
<p>Water vapor, SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O (which forms sulfate particles), and soot <sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#5" onClick="showFootnote(1,5); return false;">5</a></small></sup>
  play both direct and indirect roles in climate change and ozone chemistry.</p>

      <p><b>Box 1. The Science of Climate Change<a name="spmbox1"></a></b></p>
      <p>Some of the main conclusions of the Summary for Policymakers of Working
	Group I of the IPCC Second Assessment Report, published in 1995, which
	concerns the effects of all anthropogenic emissions on climate change,
	follow: </p>
      <ul>
	<li> Increases in greenhouse gas concentrations since pre-industrial times
	  (i.e., since about 1750) have led to a positive radiative forcing of
	  climate, tending to warm the surface of the Earth and produce other
	  changes of climate.</li>
	<li> The atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide,
	  methane, and nitrous oxide (N<span class="subscript">2</span>O), among others, have grown significantly:
	  by about 30, 145, and 15%, respectively (values for 1992). These trends
	  can be attributed largely to human activities, mostly fossil fuel use,
	  land-use change, and agriculture.</li>
	<li> Many greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for a long time (for
	  carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, many decades to centuries). As a result
	  of this, if carbon dioxide emissions were maintained at near current
	  (1994) levels, they would lead to a nearly constant rate of increase
	  in atmospheric concentrations for at least two centuries, reaching about
	  500 ppmv (approximately twice the pre-industrial concentration of 280
	  ppmv) by the end of the 21st century.</li>
	<li> Tropospheric aerosols resulting from combustion of fossil fuels,
	  biomass burning, and other sources have led to a negative radiative
	  forcing, which, while focused in particular regions and subcontinental
	  areas, can have continental to hemispheric effects on climate patterns.
	  In contrast to the long-lived greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols
	  are very short-lived in the atmosphere; hence, their radiative forcing
	  adjusts rapidly to increases or decreases in emissions. </li>
	<li>Our ability from the observed climate record to quantify the human
	  influence on global climate is currently limited because the expected
	  signal is still emerging from the noise of natural variability, and
	  because there are uncertainties in key factors. These include the magnitude
	  and patterns of long-term natural variability and the time-evolving
	  pattern of forcing by, and response to, changes in concentrations of
	  greenhouse gases and aerosols, and land-surface changes. Nevertheless,
	  the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence
	  on global climate. </li>
	<li> The IPCC has developed a range of scenarios, IS92a-f, for future
	  greenhouse gas and aerosol precursor emissions based on assumptions
	  concerning population and economic growth, land use, technological changes,
	  energy availability, and fuel mix during the period 1990 to 2100. Through
	  understanding of the global carbon cycle and of atmospheric chemistry,
	  these emissions can be used to project atmospheric concentrations of
	  greenhouse gases and aerosols and the perturbation of natural radiative
	  forcing. Climate models can then be used to develop projections of future
	  climate. </li>
	<li> Estimates of the rise in global average surface air temperature by
	  2100 relative to 1990 for the IS92 scenarios range from 1 to 3.5°C.
	  In all cases the average rate of warming would probably be greater than
	  any seen in the last 10,000 years. Regional temperature changes could
	  differ substantially from the global mean and the actual annual to decadal
	  changes would include considerable natural variability. A general warming
	  is expected to lead to an increase in the occurrence of extremely hot
	  days and a decrease in the occurrence of extremely cold days. </li>
	<li> Average sea level is expected to rise as a result of thermal expansion
	  of the oceans and melting of glaciers and ice-sheets. Estimates of the
	  sea level rise by 2100 relative to 1990 for the IS92 scenarios range
	  from 15 to 95 cm. </li>
	<li> Warmer temperatures will lead to a more vigorous hydrological cycle;
	  this translates into prospects for more severe droughts and/or floods
	  in some places and less severe droughts and/or floods in other places.
	  Several models indicate an increase in precipitation intensity, suggesting
	  a possibility for more extreme rainfall events.</li>
