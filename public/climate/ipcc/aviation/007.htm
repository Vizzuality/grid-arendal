<H2>4.4. Water Vapor</H2>
<p><i>Most subsonic aircraft water vapor emissions are released in the troposphere
  where they are rapidly removed by precipitation within 1 to 2 weeks. A smaller
  fraction of water vapor emissions is released in the lower stratosphere where
  it can build up to larger concentrations. Because water vapor is a greenhouse
  gas, these increases tend to warm the Earth's surface, though for subsonic aircraft
  this effect is smaller than those of other aircraft emissions such as carbon
  dioxide and NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. </i></p>
<H2>4.5. Contrails<a name="spm45"></a></H2>
<p> <i>In 1992, aircraft line-shaped contrails are estimated to cover about 0.1%
  of the Earth's surface on an annually averaged basis with larger regional values.
  Contrails tend to warm the Earth's surface, similar to thin high clouds. The
  contrail cover is projected to grow to 0.5% by 2050 in the reference scenario
  (Fa1), at a rate which is faster than the rate of growth in aviation fuel consumption.
  </i></p>
<p>This faster growth in contrail cover is expected because air traffic will increase
  mainly in the upper troposphere where contrails form preferentially, and may
  also occur as a result of improvements in aircraft fuel efficiency. Contrails
  are triggered from the water vapor emitted by aircraft and their optical properties
  depend on the particles emitted or formed in the aircraft plume and on the ambient
  atmospheric conditions. The radiative effect of contrails depends on their optical
  properties and global cover, both of which are uncertain. Contrails have been
  observed as line-shaped clouds by satellites over heavy air traffic areas and
  covered on average about 0.5% of the area over Central Europe in 1996 and 1997.
  &nbsp;</p>
<H2>4.6. Cirrus Clouds<a name="spm46"></a></H2>
<p><i>Extensive cirrus clouds have been observed to develop after the formation
  of persistent contrails. Increases in cirrus cloud cover (beyond those identified
  as line-shaped contrails) are found to be positively correlated with aircraft
  emissions in a limited number of studies. About 30% of the Earth is covered
  with cirrus cloud. On average an increase in cirrus cloud cover tends to warm
  the surface of the Earth. An estimate for aircraft-induced cirrus cover for
  the late 1990s ranges from 0 to 0.2% of the surface of the Earth. For the Fa1
  scenario, this may possibly increase by a factor of 4 (0 to 0.8%) by 2050; however,
  the mechanisms associated with increases in cirrus cover are not well understood
  and need further investigation. </i></p>
<H2>4.7. Sulfate and Soot Aerosols<a name="spm47"></a></H2>
<p>The aerosol mass concentrations in 1992 resulting from aircraft are small relative
  to those caused by surface sources. Although aerosol accumulation will grow
  with aviation fuel use, aerosol mass concentrations from aircraft in 2050 are
  projected to remain small compared to surface sources. Increases in soot tend
  to warm while increases in sulfate tend to cool the Earth's surface. The direct
  radiative forcing of sulfate and soot aerosols from aircraft is small compared
  to those of other aircraft emissions. Because aerosols influence the formation
  of clouds, the accumulation of aerosols from aircraft may play a role in enhanced
  cloud formation and change the radiative properties of clouds.</p>
