<h2><b>3.3. Regional and Global-Scale Impact of Aviation on Aerosols </b></h2>
<h3><b><i><a name="331"></a>3.3.1. Global Aircraft Emissions and Aerosol Sources</i></b></h3>
<p>Aircraft emissions may cause changes in the background distribution of soot
  and sulfuric acid aerosols at regional and global scales. In this section, observations
  and model results are used to evaluate these potential aircraft-induced changes.</p>
<p>Soot and sulfur mass emissions from aircraft are small compared with other
  global emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources (<a href="035.htm#tab32">Table
  3-2</a>). However, aircraft emissions occur in the upper troposphere and lower
  stratosphere, where background values are lower and removal processes are much
  less effective than near the Earth's surface. Moreover, aircraft aerosol particles
  tend to be smaller than background particles, so small emission masses may still
  cause large changes in aerosol number and surface area densities. In addition,
  aerosol particles from aircraft can participate in the formation of contrails
  and clouds in the upper troposphere, hence potentially alter the radiative balance
  of the atmosphere (<a href="040.htm">Section 3.6</a>). </p>

<p>About 93% of all aviation fuel is consumed in the Northern Hemisphere and 7%
  in the Southern Hemisphere (Baughcum et al., 1996; see <a href="130.htm">Chapter
  9</a>). Within the Northern Hemisphere, 76% of aviation fuel is consumed at
  mid- and polar latitudes (> 30�N). The geographical and altitude distribution
  of current aviation fuel consumption implies that the largest changes in aerosol
  and gas composition from aviation will be at northern mid-latitudes at altitudes
  of 10 to 12 km. </p>
<h3><b><i><a name="332"></a>3.3.2. Sulfate Aerosol </i></b></h3>
<h4><i><a name="3321"></a>3.3.2.1. Stratosphere </i></h4>
<p>The background stratospheric sulfate layer is believed to be formed largely
  via the transport of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) into the stratosphere, its subsequent
  conversion to H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> (Crutzen, 1976), and condensation of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> onto small particles
  nucleated primarily near the equatorial tropopause (Brock et al., 1995; Hamill
  et al., 1997). Current global photochemical models estimate that the natural
  source from OCS contributes 0.03 to 0.06 Tg S yr<sup>-1</sup> into the stratosphere (Chin
  and Davis, 1995; Weisenstein et al., 1997). Additional sources of stratospheric
  sulfur may be required to balance the background sulfur budget (Chin and Davis,
  1995), such as a strong convective transport of SO<span class="subscript">2</span> precursors (Weisenstein
  et al., 1997). Large increases in H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> mass in the stratosphere often occur
  in periods following volcanic eruptions (Trepte et al., 1993). Increased H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>
  increases the number and size of stratospheric aerosol particles (Wilson et
  al., 1993). The relaxation to background values requires several years, as <a href="036.htm#img36">Figure
  3-6</a> illustrates with aerosol extinction measurements derived from satellite
  observations. The relative effect of aircraft emissions will be reduced in periods
  of strong volcanic activity, particularly in the stratosphere, because the aircraft
  source of aerosol becomes small compared with the volcanic source (see <a href="034.htm#tab31">Table
  3-1</a>). </p>
<p>The current subsonic fleet injects ~0.02 Tg S yr<sup>-1</sup> into the stratosphere under
  the assumption that one-third of aviation fuel is consumed in the stratosphere
  (Hoinka et al., 1993; Berger et al., 1994) (see <a href="035.htm#tab32">Table
  3-2</a>). This amount is 1.5 to 3 times less than natural sources of stratospheric
  sulfur in nonvolcanic periods. The enhanced sulfate aerosol surface area in
  the stratosphere affects ozone photochemistry through surface reactions that
  reduce nitrogen oxides and release active chlorine species (Weisenstein et al.,
  1991, 1996; Bekki and Pyle, 1993; Fahey et al., 1993; Borrmann et al., 1996;
  Solomon et al., 1997). The chemical impact of sulfate aerosol in the stratosphere
  is discussed in Chapters <a href="020.htm">2</a> and <a href="044.htm">4</a>.</p>
<h4><i><a name="3322"></a>3.3.2.2. Troposphere </i></h4>
<p>Anthropogenic and natural sources of sulfur are much larger in the troposphere
  than in the stratosphere (<a href="035.htm#tab32">Table 3-2</a>). Anthropogenic
  emissions of sulfur exceed natural sources by factors of 2 to 3 on a global
  scale, and emission in the Northern Hemisphere exceeds that in the Southern
  Hemisphere by a factor of 10 (Langner and Rodhe, 1991). Accordingly, aerosol
  abundance is larger in the upper troposphere than in the stratosphere and larger
  in the Northern Hemisphere troposphere than in the Southern Hemisphere counterpart
  (Hofmann, 1993; Benkovitz et al., 1996; Rosen et al., 1997; Thomason et al.,
  1997a,b) (<a href="036.htm#img36">Figure 3-6</a>). Tropospheric aerosol concentrations
  are much larger than lower stratospheric concentrations under nonvolcanic conditions.
  Condensation nucleus number densities exceeding 1,000 cm<sup>-3</sup> are not uncommon
  in the troposphere (Schr�der and Str�m, 1997; Hofmann et al., 1998), whereas
  values in the lower stratosphere are less than 50 cm<sup>-3</sup> in nonvolcanic periods
  (Wilson et al., 1993). </p>
<p>The effect of aircraft sulfur emissions on aerosol in the upper troposphere
  and lower stratosphere is far larger than comparison of their amount with global
  sulfur sources suggests. The major surface sources of tropospheric sulfate aerosol
  include SO<span class="subscript">2</span> and dimethyl sulfide (DMS), both of which have tropospheric lifetimes
  of less than 1 week (Langner and Rodhe, 1991; Weisenstein et al., 1997). There
  is large variability in upper tropospheric aerosol particle number and size
  (Hofmann, 1993; Thomason et al., 1997b) because of variability in tropospheric
  meteorology and the short lifetime of sulfur source gases. Surface emissions
  are known to reach the upper troposphere under certain conditions, such as during
  deep mid-latitude and tropical convection (Arnold et al., 1997; Prather and
  Jacob, 1997; Dibb et al., 1998; Talbot et al., 1998). Only a small fraction
  of the surface sulfur emissions reaches the upper troposphere, however, because
  of the large removal rates of sulfur species near the surface. </p>

<h4><i><a name="3323"></a>3.3.2.3. Differences between the Upper Troposphere and
  Lower Stratosphere </i></h4>
<p>The effects of aircraft emissions on aerosol particles and aerosol precursors
  depend on the amounts emitted into the troposphere and stratosphere. In addition
  to aerosol abundance and sources, stratospheric and tropospheric aerosols also
  differ in composition and residence time. Typical parameters for sulfate at
  12 and 20 km at northern mid-latitudes are summarized in <a href="034.htm#tab31">Table
  3-1</a>. </p>
<p>Sulfate is considered to be the dominant component of stratospheric aerosol;
  soot and metals are considered to be minor components (Pueschel, 1996). The
  composition of tropospheric aerosol, particularly near the surface, also includes
  ammonium, minerals, dust, sea salt, and organic particles (Warneck, 1988). The
  role of minor components of aerosol composition in affecting heterogeneous reaction
  rates is not fully understood. In general, the lower stratosphere contains highly
  concentrated H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>/H<span class="subscript">2</span>O particles (65-80% H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> mass fraction) as a result of
  low relative humidity in the stratosphere and low temperatures (Steele and Hamill,
  1981; Carslaw et al., 1997). Higher H<span class="subscript">2</span>O abundances (by a factor of 10 or more)
  and similar temperatures cause particles in the upper troposphere to be more
  dilute (40-60% H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>). Surface reactions that activate chlorine are particularly
  effective on dilute H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> particles and cirrus cloud particles at low temperatures
  in the tropopause region (<a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>). </p>
<p>Aircraft emissions injected into the stratosphere have greater potential to
  perturb the aerosol layer than those emitted into the troposphere, because in
  the stratosphere the background concentrations are lower and the residence times
  are longer. The initial residence time (1/e-folding time) of most of the stratospheric
  sulfate aerosol mass from volcanic eruptions is about 1 year as a result of
  aerosol sedimentation rates (Hofmann and Solomon, 1989; Thomason et al., 1997b;
  Barnes and Hofmann, 1997) (see also <a href="036.htm#img36">Figure 3-6</a>). The
  residence time of the remaining aerosol mass contained in smaller particles
  is several years. The residence time of upper tropospheric aerosol particles
  is much smaller, ranging from several days (Charlson et al., 1992) to between
  10 and 15 days (Balkanski et al., 1993; Schwartz, 1996). Tropospheric particles
  are larger than those in the stratosphere (Hofmann, 1990), therefore sediment
  faster. They are also removed by cloud scavenging and rainout. </p>
<h3><b><i><a name="333"></a>3.3.3. Observations of Aircraft-Produced Aerosol and
  Sulfate Aerosol Changes </i></b></h3>
<p>Observations of aircraft-induced aerosols have increased substantially in recent
  years (see <a href="034.htm">Section 3.2</a>). Concentrations of aerosol particles
  and aerosol precursor gases well above background values have been observed
  in the exhaust plumes of aircraft operating in the upper troposphere and lower
  stratosphere. Although aircraft emissions are quickly diluted by mixing with
  ambient air to near background values, the accumulation of emissions in flight
  corridors used in the routing of commercial air traffic has the potential to
  cause notable atmospheric changes. </p>

<p>Estimated changes from aircraft emissions (Schumann, 1994; WMO, 1995) are small
  compared with natural variability, hence are not always apparent in observational
  data sets. However, regional enhancements in concentrations of aircraft-produced
  aerosol have been observed near air traffic corridors. During measurement flights
  across the North Atlantic flight corridor over the eastern Atlantic, signatures
  of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, SO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and condensation nuclei (CN) were clearly evident in the exhaust
  plumes of 22 aircraft that passed the corridor at this altitude in the preceding
  3 h, with values exceeding background ambient levels by 30, 5, and 3 times,
  respectively (Schlager et al., 1997). A mean CN/NO<span class="subscript">x</span> abundance ratio of 300 cm<sup>-3</sup>
  ppbv-1 was measured. This ratio corresponds to a mean particle emission index
  of about 1016 kg<sup>-1</sup> and implies CN increases of 30 cm<sup>-3</sup> in corridor regions where
  aircraft increase NO<span class="subscript">x</span> by 0.1 ppbv (cf. <a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>). The
  regional perturbation was found to be detectable at scales of more than 1,000
  km under special meteorological conditions within a long-lasting stagnant anticyclone
  (Schlager et al., 1996). In an analysis of 25 years of balloon measurements
  in Wyoming in the western United States of America, subsonic aircraft are estimated
  to contribute about 5-13% of the CN concentration at 8-13 km, depending on the
  season (Hofmann et al., 1998). This estimate provides only a lower bound of
  the aircraft contribution because smaller aircraft-produced particles (radius
  < 10 nm) are not detected. Additionally, regular lidar measurements have been
  made of aerosol optical depth at aircraft altitudes (10-13 km) in an area of
  heavy air traffic in southern Germany (J�ger et al., 1998). Large optical depths
  on the order of 0.1 that could be attributed to the accumulation of aircraft
  aerosol were observed very rarely at this location. </p>
<p>Global changes in sulfate aerosol properties at subsonic air traffic altitudes 
  were small over the last few decades. The examination of long-term changes in 
  aerosol parameters suggests that aircraft operations up to the present time 
  have not substantially changed the background aerosol mass. Multiyear observations 
  for the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere are available from satellite 
  and balloon platforms and ground-based lidar systems. Long-term variations of 
  the optical depth in the upper troposphere from the SAGE satellite (<a href="036.htm#img36">Figure 
  3-6</a> and <a href="036.htm#tab33">Table 3-3</a>) have been analyzed with periods 
  of volcanic influence excluded (Kent et al., 1998). Data indicate that changes 
  are less than about 1% yr<sup>-1</sup> between 1979 and 1998, when observations 
  are averaged over either hemisphere. A significant change in aerosol amounts 
  is also not found in the 15- to 30-km region examined with lidar over Mauna 
  Loa (20�N) for the period 1979 to 1996 (Barnes and Hofmann, 1997). Similarly, 
  aerosol mass data above the tropopause derived from lidar soundings show no 
  trend in a region of heavy air traffic in Germany (48�N) over the last 22 years 
  (<a href="036.htm#img37">Figure 3-7</a>) (J�ger and Hofmann, 1991; J�ger et 
  al., 1998). </p>

<p>Long-term changes in aerosol parameters measured in situ are also small. In
  situ measurements are important because the number of particles in the upper
  troposphere and lowermost stratosphere is dominated by sizes that are too small
  (< 0.15-mm radius) to be remotely detected. Long-term changes in CN are small
  in the 10- to 12-km region of the mid-latitude troposphere, where most of the
  current aircraft fleet operates (Hofmann, 1993). The 5% yr<sup>-1</sup> increase in larger
  particle (radius > 0.15 mm) abundances found in lower stratospheric balloon
  measurements made between 1979 and 1990 was considered consistent with the accumulation
  of aircraft sulfur emissions (Hofmann, 1990, 1991). However, the absence of
  a change in observed stratospheric CN number suggests that the trend in the
  larger particles is the result of the growth of existing particles rather than
  nucleation of new particles. Model results show that the contribution of the
  current subsonic fleet to aerosol mass amounts between 15 and 20 km is about
  100 times smaller than the observed aerosol amounts (<a href="036.htm#334">Section
  3.3.4</a>; Bekki and Pyle, 1992). Previous balloon-borne CN counters did not
  measure particles below 10 nm in radius, which are now detected with more modern
  CN counters and dominate aerosol number in aircraft plumes. Moreover, the attribution
  of aerosol changes to aircraft is complicated by changes in surface sources
  of sulfur and episodic strong injections of sulfur from volcanic eruptions (Hitchman
  et al., 1994; Barnes and Hofmann, 1997; Thomason et al., 1997a,b). Hence, the
  contribution of aircraft emissions to changes or possible trends in these regions
  is difficult to determine at present. </p>
<h3><b><i><a name="334"></a>3.3.4. Modeling Sulfate Aerosol Perturbations Caused
  by Aircraft </i></b></h3>
<h4><i><a name="3341"></a>3.3.4.1. Subsonic Aircraft</i></h4>
<p>Global models are required to evaluate the atmospheric impact of aerosol generated
  by subsonic aircraft (Friedl, 1997; Brasseur et al., 1998). The global distribution
  of tropospheric sulfur species has been investigated using various three-dimensional
  (3-D) models (Langner and Rodhe, 1991; Penner et al., 1994; Chin et al., 1996;
  Feichter et al., 1996; Pham et al., 1996; Schwartz, 1996). Because most models
  have been developed to investigate regional or global effects of surface emissions
  in the lower or middle troposphere, few have addressed the potential impact
  of aviation sources on aerosol parameters in the upper troposphere and lower
  stratosphere. </p>
<p>A systematic model study has been carried out with a suite of two-dimensional
  (2-D) and 3-D atmospheric models to determine upper bounds for the accumulation
  of aviation aerosol in the atmosphere (Danilin et al., 1998). Each model computed
  the steady-state global distribution of a passive tracer emitted into the model
  atmosphere with the same rate and distribution as aviation fuel use, based on
  the NASA 1992 database (see <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a>). The only sink
  for the passive tracer is below 400 hPa (approximately 7 km), where it is removed
  with a 1/e-folding time of 5 days. The resultant global tracer distribution
  can be used to provide estimates of steady-state concentration change from a
  specific emission by multiplying the tracer value by the associated aircraft
  engine emission index (EI). <a href="036.htm#img38">Figure 3-8 </a>shows steady-state
  tracer distributions in tracer-to-air mass mixing ratio units and annually and
  zonally averaged fuel source used in the simulation. <a href="036.htm#tab34">Table

<p>All models predict the largest perturbation at mid-latitudes in the Northern
  Hemisphere in the altitude range of 10-12 km. However, the magnitude of the
  perturbation varies by a factor of 10, ranging from 12.6 (ECHAm<sup>3</sup>) to 122 ng
  g<sup>-1</sup> (GSFC-2D), reflecting differences in model resolution and current uncertainties
  in modeling of global atmospheric dynamics and turbulent diffusion. To mitigate
  the effects of model resolution, the tracer amount was summed in the 8- to 16-km
  altitude region between 30 and 90�N (shown by the thick dashed line in <a href="036.htm#img38">Figure
  3-8</a>). This region contains 34 (AER, ECHAm<sup>3</sup>) to 61% (GSFC-2D) of the total
  accumulated tracer. The absolute amount of tracer mass in this volume ranges
  from 2.9 (ECHAm<sup>3</sup>) to 14.5 Tg (GSFC-2D). The amount of the tracer above 12 km,
  which serves to diagnose the fraction of aircraft emissions transported toward
  the stratospheric ozone maximum, ranges from 14 (UCI/GISS, GSFC-2D) to 45% (UMICH,
  AER) of each model's global tracer amount. The global residence time of the
  fuel tracer, defined as the ratio of the steady-state tracer mass to the tracer
  source, varies from 21 days (Tm<sup>3</sup>, ECHAm<sup>3</sup>) to 65 days (GSFC-2D, LLNL). The lower
  values are similar to the global residence times (approximately 18 days) found
  for air parcels uniformly released at 11 km between 20 and 60�N and followed
  with a trajectory model using assimilated wind fields (Schoeberl et al., 1998).
  The 1/e-folding aircraft emissions lifetime of 50 days computed by Gettelman
  (1998) is consistent with the results of the fuel tracer experiment described
  here (Danilin et al., 1998). </p>
<p>The model simulation results indicate that aircraft contribute little to the
  sulfate mass near the tropopause. For example, the sulfate aerosol mass density
  from the GSFC-2D model (see <a href="036.htm#img38">Figure 3-8</a>) is 0.055 mg
  m<sup>-3</sup> at 10 km at 55�N, in contrast to background concentrations of 1 to 2 mg
  m<sup>-3</sup> (Yue et al., 1994). Other recent model studies (Danilin et al., 1997; Kjellstr�m
  et al., 1998) show similar results for aerosol mass; these studies further conclude
  that aircraft emissions may noticeably enhance the background number and surface
  area densities (SAD) of sulfate aerosol (see Tables <a href="034.htm#tab31">3-1</a>
  and <a href="036.htm#tab34">3-4</a>) because of the smaller radii of aircraft-produced
  particles. </p>
<p>Fuel tracer simulation also provides estimates of soot and sulfate column amounts
  that can be used to calculate the direct radiative forcing of current subsonic
  fleet emissions (see <a href="063.htm">Chapter 6</a>). Maximum tracer column
  values are located near 50 to 60�N and range from 4.1 (ECHAm<sup>3</sup>) to 22.9 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>
  (GSFC-2D). To calculate instantaneous direct radiative forcing at the top of
  the atmosphere from aircraft soot emissions, globally averaged tracer column
  values (which are smaller than their maximum values by a factor of 3 to 4) are
  first multiplied by EI(soot) to obtain soot column values. For aircraft sulfur
  emissions, the tracer column is scaled by EI(S), the ratio of molar mass of
  SO4 and S, and a 100% conversion fraction of sulfur to sulfate (see <a href="036.htm#tab34">Table
  3-4</a>). For the suite of models in <a href="036.htm#tab34">Table 3-4</a>,
  the upper bound for the average soot column is 0.1 ng cm<sup>-2</sup>, with a range from
  0.07 to 0.20 ng cm<sup>-2</sup>; for the average sulfate column the upper bound is 2.9
  ng cm<sup>-2</sup>, with a range from 2 to 6 ng cm<sup>-2</sup>. If photochemical oxidation lifetime
  and tropospheric washout rate are taken into account, a 50% conversion fraction
  of sulfur to sulfate is a more suitable value than 100%. In this case, the average
  sulfate column is 1.4 ng cm<sup>-2</sup>, with a range of 1 to 3 ng cm<sup>-2</sup>. </p>

<p>In addition to the passive tracer simulation, the AER 2-D model also calculated
  the evolution of aerosol using a sulfur photochemistry and aerosol microphysics
  model designed for stratospheric conditions (Weisenstein et al., 1997). This
  model calculates about 3.4 ng cm<sup>-2</sup> for the perturbation in sulfate aerosol at
  55�N, consistent with the AER model value in <a href="036.htm#tab34">Table 3-4
  </a>but almost 30 times smaller than the background sulfate column amounts (~100
  ng cm<sup>-2</sup>). <a href="036.htm#img39">Figure 3-9</a> depicts the annually averaged
  increase of sulfate aerosol SAD calculated with the AER 2-D model, assuming
  5% conversion of sulfur emissions into new particles (as recommended in <a href="034.htm">Section
  3.2</a>) with a radius of 5 nm and fuel with 0.4 g S/kg. The maximum SAD perturbation,
  located at about 10-12 km in northern mid-latitudes, is about 0.3 mm<sup>2</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>,
  which is comparable to ambient values in nonvolcanic periods (Hofmann and Solomon,
  1989; Thomason et al., 1997b). </p>
<p><a href="034.htm#tab31">Table 3-1</a> presents upper-bound estimates of soot
  and sulfate aerosol number and surface area densities from 1992 fuel simulations.
  Present aircraft emissions noticeably increase the number and surface area densities
  of aerosol particles in the tropopause region despite the large CN background
  concentration in the upper troposphere. The estimates use the range of values
  of computed tracer concentrations from all models and the effective EIs of soot
  and sulfate mass and assume a mean particle size of 10(20) nm for sulfate (soot)
  particles and a 5% conversion of sulfur to sulfate aerosol. The results represent
  order-of-magnitude estimates of zonal mean maximum values at 12 km and can be
  compared with background aerosol properties in the lowermost stratosphere as
  given in <a href="034.htm#tab31">Table 3-1</a>. For these estimates, 5% of the
  emitted sulfur dioxide is assumed to be converted to sulfuric acid before dispersal
  out of the zonal region of maximum air traffic. </p>
<p>Tracer simulations strongly suggest that aircraft emissions are not the source
  of observed decadal H<span class="subscript">2</span>O changes at 40�N. The simulation results can be scaled
  by EI(H<span class="subscript">2</span>O) to provide an upper bound (neglecting precipitation from the upper
  troposphere) for the accumulation of water vapor above the tropopause as a result
  of aircraft emissions. The LLNL model shows the largest tracer accumulation
  at 40�N, with equivalent H<span class="subscript">2</span>O values smoothly decreasing from 55 ppbv at 10 km
  to 12 ppbv at 24 km. These values are small in comparison to current ambient
  values of 59 ppmv at 10-12 km and 4.2 ppmv at 22-24 km (Oltmans and Hofmann,
  1995). Assuming 5% yr<sup>-1</sup> growth in fuel consumption and EI(H<span class="subscript">2</span>O) of 1.23 kg/kg,
  the change in aircraft-produced H<span class="subscript">2</span>O ranges from 3.4 ppbv yr<sup>-1</sup> at 10 km to 0.8
  ppbv yr<sup>-1</sup> at 24 km. These values represent a change of +0.006% yr<sup>-1</sup> at 10 km
  and +0.018% yr<sup>-1</sup> at 24 km and are more than of 20 times smaller than those found
  in long-term balloon observations (Oltmans and Hofmann, 1995). </p>
<h4><i><a name="3342"></a>3.3.4.2. Supersonic Aircraft </i></h4>
<p>The impact of a future fleet of supersonic aircraft on sulfate aerosol abundance
  in the stratosphere has been discussed using measurements and model results
  (Bekki and Pyle, 1993; Fahey et al., 1995a; Stolarski et al., 1995; Weisenstein
  et al., 1996, 1998). The results suggest that aerosol surface area density will
  be substantially greater than nonvolcanic background values in proposed fleet
  scenarios (<a href="041.htm">Section 3.7</a> and <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>). The consequences for stratospheric ozone changes depend on the simultaneous
  emissions of nitrogen oxides and chlorine and aerosol loadings of the atmosphere
  (Solomon et al., 1997; Weisenstein et al., 1998; see also <a href="020.htm">Chapter
  2</a>). </p>
