<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Aircraft emissions in conjunction with other anthropogenic sources are expected
    to modify atmospheric composition (gases and aerosols), hence radiative forcing
    and climate. Atmospheric changes from aircraft result from three types of
    processes: direct emission of radiatively active substances (e.g., CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>
    or water vapor); emission of chemical species that produce or destroy radiatively
    active substances (e.g., NO<font size="-2">x</font>, which modifies O<font size="-2">3</font>
    concentration); and emission of substances that trigger the generation of
    aerosol particles or lead to changes in natural clouds (e.g., contrails).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Radiative forcing (RF) is the metric used here (and in IPCC) to compare
    climate perturbations among different aviation scenarios and with total anthropogenic
    climate change. RF is the global, annual mean radiative imbalance to the Earth's
    climate system caused by human activities. It predicts changes to the global
    mean surface temperature: Positive RF leads to global warming. Yet climate
    does not change uniformly; some regions warm or cool more than others; and
    mean temperature does not describe vital aspects of climate change such as
    droughts and severe storms. Aviation's impacts via O<font size="-2">3</font>
    and contrails occur predominantly in northern mid-latitudes and the upper
    troposphere, leading potentially to climate change of a different nature than
    that from CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>. Nevertheless, we follow the scientific
    basis for RF from IPCC's Second Assessment Report and take summed RF as a
    first-order measure of global mean climate change.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> For the 1992 aviation scenario (NASA-1992*), radiative forcing of climate
    change from aircraft emissions (gases and aerosols) is estimated to be +0.05
    W m<sup>-2</sup>, which is about 3.5% of total anthropogenic radiative forcing as measured
    against the pre-industrial atmosphere of +1.4 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>
    for combined greenhouse gases and aerosols (and +2.7 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>
    for greenhouse gases alone). The components of aircraft-induced radiative
    forcing are as follows: CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>, +0.018 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>;
    NO<font size="-2">x</font>, +0.023 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> (via ozone
    changes) and -0.014 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> (via methane changes); contrails,
    +0.02 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>; stratospheric H<font size="-2">2</font>O,
    +0.002 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>; sulfate aerosol (direct effect), -0.003
    W m<font size="-1">-2</font>; and black carbon aerosol (soot), +0.003 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>.
    Changes in "natural" cirrus clouds caused by aircraft may result in negligible
    or potentially large radiative forcing; an estimate could fall between 0 and
    0.04 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>. Uncertainty estimates, typically a factor
    of 2 or 3, have been made for individual components and are intended to represent
    consistent confidence intervals that the radiative forcing value is likely
    (2/3 of the time) to fall within the range shown. The uncertainty estimate
    for the total radiative forcing (without additional cirrus clouds) is calculated
    as the square root of the sums of the squares of the upper and lower ranges
    of the individual components.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Projection of subsonic fleet growth to 2015 (NASA-2015* scenario) results
    in a best estimate for total aircraft-induced radiative forcing of +0.11 W
    m<font size="-1">-2</font> in 2015-about 5% of IS92a projected radiative forcing
    from all anthropogenic emissions that year. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Various options for the future development of subsonic air traffic under
    the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)-developed Forecasting
    and Economic Subgroup (FESG, or F-type) scenarios for aviation in the year
    2050 assume an increase in fuel use by 2050 relative to 1992 by a factor of
    1.7 to 4.8. These options result in a range for aircraft-induced total radiative
    forcing (without additional cirrus clouds) from +0.13 to +0.28 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>
    in 2050, or 3-7% of IS92a total anthropogenic radiative forcing for that year.
    However, the upper and lower bounds represent aircraft scenarios that diverge
    significantly from economic growth assumed for IS92a. Alternative Environmental
    Defense Fund (EDF, or E-type) scenarios considered here adopt growth in 2050
    fuel use by factors of 7 to more than 10 and result in a range of total radiative
    forcing (without additional cirrus clouds) from +0.4 to +0.6 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>For the year 2050, a scenario that matches IS92a economic growth (scenario
    Fa1) gives total radiative forcing of +0.19 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>.
    Individual contributions to aircraft-induced radiative forcing are as follows:
    CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, +0.074 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>; NO<font size="-2">x</font>, +0.060
    W m<font size="-1">-2</font> (via ozone changes) and -0.045 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>
    (via methane changes); contrails, +0.10 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>; stratospheric
    H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, +0.004 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>; sulfate aerosols (direct effect),
    -0.009 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>; and black carbon aerosols (soot), +0.009
    W m<font size="-1">-2</font>. The contrail estimate includes an increase in
    fuel consumption, higher overall efficiency of propulsion (i.e., cooler exhaust),
    and shifting of routes. An estimate for the radiative forcing from additional
    cirrus could fall between 0 and 0.16 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>As one option for future aviation, we consider the addition of a fleet of
    high-speed civil transport (HSCT, supersonic) aircraft replacing part of the
    subsonic air traffic under scenario Fa1. In this example, HSCT aircraft are
    assumed to begin operation in the year 2015, to grow linearly to a maximum
    of 1,000 aircraft by the year 2040, and to use new technologies to maintain
    very low emissions of 5 g NO<span class="subscript">2</span> per kg fuel. By the year 2050, this combined
    fleet (scenario Fa1H) would add 0.08 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> on top of
    the 0.19 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> radiative forcing from scenario F1a.
    This additional radiative forcing combines direct HSCT effects with the reduction
    in equivalent subsonic air traffic: +0.006 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> from
    additional CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, +0.10 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> from increased stratospheric
    H<font size="-2">2</font>O, -0.012 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> from ozone
    and methane changes resulting from NO<font size="-2">x</font> emissions, and
    -0.011 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> from reduced contrails. In total, the
    best value for HSCT RF is about 5 times larger than that of displaced subsonic
    aircraft, although the recognized uncertainty includes a factor as small as
    zero. The RFs from changes in stratospheric H<font size="-2">2</font>O and
    O<font size="-2">3</font> are difficult to simulate in models and remain highly
    uncertain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Although the task of detecting climate change from all human activities
    is already difficult, detecting the aircraft-specific contribution to global
    climate change is not possible now and presents a serious challenge for the
    next century. Aircraft radiative forcing, like forcing from other individual
    sectors, is a small fraction of the whole anthropogenic climate forcing: about
    4% today and by the year 2050 reaching 3-7% for F-type scenarios and 10-15%
    for E-type scenarios. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The Radiative Forcing Index (RFI)-the ratio of total radiative forcing to
    that from CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font> emissions alone-is a measure of the importance
    of aircraft-induced climate change other than that from the release of fossil
    carbon alone. In 1992, the RFI for aircraft is 2.7; it evolves to 2.6 in 2050
    for the Fa1 scenario. This index ranges from 2.2 to 3.4 for the year 2050
    for various E- and F-type scenarios for subsonic aviation and technical options
    considered here. The RFI increases from 2.6 to 3.4 with the addition of HSCTs
    (scenario Fa1H), primarily as a result of the effects of stratospheric water
    vapor. Thus, aircraft-induced climate change with RFI > 1 points to the need
    for a more thorough climate assessment for this sector. By comparison, in
    the IS92a scenario the RFI for all human activities is about 1, although for
    greenhouse gases alone it is about 1.5, and it is even higher for sectors
    emitting CH<font size="-1">4</font> and N<font size="-2">2</font>O without
    significant fossil fuel use.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>From 1990 to 2050, the global mean surface temperature is expected to increase
    by 0.9 K following scenario IS92a for all human activity (assuming a climate
    sensitivity of +2.5 K for doubling of CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>). Aircraft
    emissions from subsonic fleet scenario Fa1 are estimated to be responsible
    for about 0.05 K of this temperature rise. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>At present, the largest aircraft forcings of climate are through CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>,
    NO<font size="-2">x</font>, and contrail formation. These components have
    similar magnitude for subsonic aircraft; for an HSCT fleet, H<font size="-2">2</font>O
    perturbations in the lower stratosphere, which are the most uncertain, are
    the most important. The largest areas of scientific uncertainty in predicting
    aircraft-induced climate effects lie with persistent contrails, with tropospheric
    ozone increases and consequent changes in methane, with potential particle
    impacts on "natural" clouds, and with water vapor and ozone perturbations
    in the lower stratosphere (especially for supersonic transport). </li>
</ul>
