<h2><b>5.5. Conclusions </b></h2>
<p>Current radiative transfer models are able to predict the influence of changes
  in ozone on ground-level UV irradiances with a high degree of confidence. The
  ability of these models to treat aerosols is less well developed because of
  uncertainties in their optical properties. In addition, the geometrical complexity
  and temporal variability of clouds still pose challenges to accurate radiative
  transfer modeling. From the standpoint of assessing the effects of future aviation,
  it appears that changes in atmospheric ozone abundances are the most important
  driver of changes in UV irradiance. Outcomes predicted for a range of scenarios
  are summarized below. </p>
<p>A fleet of subsonic aircraft leads to a latitude-dependent reduction in UVery,
  with the greatest percentage changes in the Northern Hemisphere. In the year
  2015, the best estimate of the change in UVery for July associated with a subsonic
  fleet lies in the range -0.5 to -1.0% poleward of 30�N. When the range of uncertainty
  is included, the spread in calculated change in irradiance is<sup>-1</sup>.8 to -0.5%
  at 45�N. These values are for the year 2015 for a subsonic fleet relative to
  the year 2015 without this fleet. In the Southern Hemisphere, the corresponding
  best estimate of change in UVery for January is less than -0.3% from the equator
  to 30�S and near 0% at 60�S. For 1992, the calculated impacts for aviation are
  about half those calculated for 2015. In 2050, the calculated impacts of a pure
  subsonic fleet are about 50% greater than those for 2015. </p>
<p>Scenarios based on fleets containing subsonic and supersonic aircraft imply
  aviation-related increases in UVery in 2015 and 2050 relative to what would
  otherwise be expected in those years. The best estimates for both years are
  similar-very little impact on UVery in the tropics, rising to increases between
  about 0.2 and 0.8% around 65� in both hemispheres. Although these estimated
  changes may be considered small, they do have significantly larger uncertainty
  limits. For the 67% likelihood range, it is estimated that the percentage change
  in UVery relative to the background atmosphere can be expressed as (-2% + best
  estimate) to (+3% + best estimate)-a 5% range in the change relative to the
  background column. As can be seen from the middle panel of <a href="060.htm#img59">Figure
  5-9</a>, this range always encompasses the possibility of no change in UVery
  relative to the corresponding background atmosphere. </p>
<p>The change in aerosol loading expected from increased aircraft operations between
  the present and 2050 is small relative to both the natural aerosol background
  and anthropogenic influences other than those related to aviation. The effect
  of the aircraft-related increase in aerosols is to reduce UV irradiance by less
  than 0.1%. Calculations indicate that aircraft-related increases in contrails
  lead to a decrease in UV irradiance of less than 0.5% in regions where 10% of
  the sky is covered. </p>
<p>The anticipated decline of the chlorine and bromine content of the stratosphere
  as well as increased emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> from combustion between 1992 and 2050
  are expected to lead to latitude-dependent increases in ozone amounts and consequent
  decreases in UVery, irrespective of future aviation. For a background atmosphere
  at 45�N in July, the calculated change in UVery with respect to a 1970 background
  is +8, +3, and -3% for 1992, 2015, and 2050, respectively. At 45�S in January,
  the calculated changes are 9, 4.5, and 0% for 1992, 2015, and 2050, respectively.
  Observed changes in total ozone from 1970 to 1992 imply smaller percentage increases
  in UVery, indicating the degree of uncertainty in the model predictions. </p>
