<h3> 7.8.3. Historical Trends and Forecasts for Sulfur Content</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, surveys show that the sulfur content of most fuels is well
  below specified limits. All of the surveys show that about 90% of fuels have
  sulfur content less than 0.1%. <a href="109.htm#img736">Figure 7-36</a> shows the historical trends for the
  U.S. and UK surveys. In the UK, average sulfur level has remained relatively
  constant since 1988 (Rickard and Fulker, 1997); in the United States, however,
  the average sulfur content in the NIPER survey has been increasing. This trend
  conflicts with reports (Hadaller and Momenthy, 1993) based on projections of
  increased hydro-treatment to reduce sulfur in gasoline and diesel fuel. However,
  changes in gasoline production have not significantly affected jet fuel because
  there is very little overlap in the boiling range. </p>
<p>The impact of the trend to use low-sulfur diesel fuels is not clear. Many refineries
  worldwide do not have the hydro-treating capability to make low-sulfur fuels.
  The API/NPRA survey for 1996 reported that 46% of the jet fuel blendstock in
  the United States was straight-run material that was not hydro-treated (API/NPRA,
  1997). For many of these refineries with limited hydro-treating capability,
  the most economical approach may be to shift blending stocks with higher sulfur
  content to jet fuel, saving streams with lower sulfur for diesel fuel. </p>
<p>Without legislation, it is unlikely that average sulfur worldwide will change
  much from current levels of 0.04-0.06%. The fuel specification certainly could
  be tightened to allow no more than 0.1% without any apparent increase in cost
  or availability, and closer to 0.05% might be possible. There will be areas
  around the world where the sulfur will come down on its own, but there will
  also be pockets where it will stay relatively high. Specific details on future
  trends of sulfur content do not exist in the literature; a special survey of
  worldwide refinery plans would be required to develop a better picture. </p>
<p>Gas-to-liquid conversion processes to produce kerosene (e.g., Fisher-Tropsch
  processes) yield jet fuel that is almost sulfur-free. Although this approach
  is attractive in a few regions where there is an abundance of unused natural
  gas, it is unlikely that this resource will be significant until well into the
  next century, as the process becomes more economically viable (Singleton, 1997).
  Biomass gasification could also be used to produce the synthesis-gas feedstock
  for Fisher-Tropsch conversion. </p>
<h3>7.8.4. Alternative Fuels to Kerosene<a name="784"></a></h3>
<p>Current aircraft-along with the airport infrastructure for supply, delivery,
  and storage of fuel-are specifically optimized for the use of current kerosene
  fuels; any significant changes in fuel type or specification would require major
  modifications to all of these elements. These are non-trivial matters involving
  major perturbations in the existing system, with significant efforts and costs.
  With this in mind, several alternative fuels have been considered in terms of
  their environmental impact. These alternatives include alcohols, methane, and
  hydrogen; more recently, some consideration has been given to using methylated
  esters of vegetable oils as kerosene extenders. Such fuels must be compatible
  with the basic capabilities and requirements of existing aircraft. They must
  have sufficient energy density, for example, to meet payload and range requirements.
  They must also be compatible with all materials (metallic and non-metallic)
  used in the engine's fuel system and have adequate lubricity to ensure that
  current margins and standards of safety-critical items such as fuel pumps are
  not compromised. </p>

<p>Introduction of an alternative fuel that does not meet the requirements of
  current aircraft would imply the use of a two-fuel system at all airports until
  all current aircraft are replaced by new, alternatively fueled aircraft. The
  prospect of limiting the availability of a new fuel to a few airports does not
  appear to be viable because of the need to retain full services for aircraft
  diverted by weather or mechanical problems.Although alternative fuels may offer
  some emissions benefits, the major disadvantage is significantly lower energy
  density compared with kerosene. This density deficit means that the aircraft
  would have to be designed with larger fuel tanks. <a href="109.htm#tab710">Table
  7-10</a> compares the net heats of combustion for several alternative fuels
  on the basis of mass and volume. For cryogenic fuels, there must also be consideration
  for the mass and volume of insulation. </p>
<p>Ethanol and methanol are liquid fuels that can be pumped and metered in conventional
  fuel systems, and they can be made from renewable energy sources. They are impractical
  fuels for aviation, however, because of their very low heat content, in mass
  and volume terms. From a safety standpoint, these alcohols have very low flash
  points-only 12 and 18&#176;C, respectively-compared with the minimum allowed of 38&#176;C.
  There are also chemical incompatibilities associated with fuel system materials,
  although these problems could be remedied with relatively minor changes. Furthermore,
  the combustion of alcohols produces organic acids and aldehydes in the exhaust
  at idle conditions on the ground, with attendant health hazards to ground support
  personnel (Eiff et al., 1992).There have not been any definitive engine studies
  using methyl esters of vegetable oils, such as soybean or rapeseed oils, although
  some evaluations are underway (e.g., Scholes et al., 1998). Adding such a material
  to jet fuel would not be allowed under any current fuel specifications for jet
  fuel because of compositional considerations. Furthermore, studies with methyl
  esters of soybean oil suggest that more than about 2% will raise the freezing
  point above the specification maximum. Based on the results of Eiff et al.,
  (1992) using ethanol blends with jet fuel, adding methyl esters of vegetable
  oils to jet fuel would result in lower exhaust smoke/particulates at high-power
  conditions but increased CO and hydrocarbons at idle conditions, along with
  the presence of acids and aldehydes. The effect on NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is uncertain, but would
  be directly related to any changes in flame temperature. </p>
<p>Aircraft gas turbines can be designed to operate on cryogenic fuels such as
  methane or hydrogen; conventional fuel systems, however, cannot handle these
  fuels. Such fuels would require new aircraft fuel system designs, as well as
  new ground handling and storage systems. Moreover, cryogenic fuels would have
  to be stored in the fuselage rather than the wings to reduce heat transfer.
  Because methane and hydrogen have only 65 and 25%, respectively, of the energy
  density of jet fuel, fuselages would have to be considerably larger than current
  designs-increasing drag and fuel consumption. For long-range flights, this penalty
  would be offset by a reduction in take-off weight because hydrogen and, to a
  small extent, methane have higher specific energies than kerosene. Design studies
  for hydrogen-fueled, long-range (10,000 km) aircraft have shown that the lighter
  fuel weight results in almost a 20% reduction in energy consumption compared
  to kerosene-fueled aircraft even accounting for losses (Momenthy, 1996). The
  same study showed, however, that for medium- and short-range (5500 km and 3200
  km) aircraft, there is an energy penalty of 17-38%. For methane, there was only
  a small benefit for long-range aircraft and penalties of 10-28% for medium-
  and short-range aircraft. </p>
<p>Of these two cryogenic fuels, hydrogen may be more attractive from an emissions
  standpoint. CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O emissions would be eliminated. However, water vapor
  would increase significantly despite the reduction in energy consumption. For
  the same energy consumption, burning methane would yield about 25% less CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  and about 60% more H&lt;span class=&quot;subscript&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;<span class="subscript"></span>O than burning jet fuel. Burning hydrogen would result
  in 2.6 times as much water vapor as burning jet fuel, but no CO<span class="subscript">2</span>. <a href="110.htm#tab711">Table
  7-11</a> compares the energy-specific emissions indices of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O at constant
  payload. (Effects of weight savings/penalties are not included in <a href="110.htm#tab711">Table
  7-11</a> because they depend heavily on the range of the aircraft.) </p>
<p>This basis of comparison could yield a quantitative "greenhouse" comparison
  of these three fuels if the greenhouse equivalency were known. <a href="110.htm#img737">Figure
  7-37</a> presents the results from such a study for a hydrogen-fueled aircraft
  derived from the Airbus A310; the analysis takes into account the relative greenhouse
  effects of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> at different altitudes and shows that hydrogen
  offers a significant reduction in greenhouse effect over kerosene at all altitudes
  for this aircraft (Klug et al, 1996). Inefficiencies of production would alter
  these results somewhat in a comprehensive energy comparison, although water
  emissions are of environmental concern only at cruise altitudes. <a href="110.htm#img738">Figure
  7-38</a> compares relative CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions from the manufacture and use of alternative
  aviation fuels from different resources (Hadaller et al., 1993). The potential
  benefits of hydrogen can be realized only if hydrogen can be obtained from water
  without the use of fossil fuels to provide the energy. Nuclear power is the
  best method identified in <a href="110.htm#img738">Figure 7-38</a>. The Kvaemer
  process is being developed as a method for converting hydrocarbons into hydrogen,
  with carbon as a byproduct (as opposed to CO<span class="subscript">2</span> with the steam reforming process);
  if the energy requirements are sufficient, this fuel would appear on <a href="110.htm#img738">Figure
  7-38</a> with a value less than 1.0. Kerosene from biomass [via a Fischer-Tropsch
  (F-T) synthesis process] would also have relative CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions less than 1.0
  if included in <a href="110.htm#img738">Figure 7-38</a>. </p>
<p>Liquid hydrogen offers an environmental advantage only if this fuel were produced
  on a renewable energy basis, as explained above. The necessary technology exists,
  but such liquid hydrogen is not economically competitive with kerosene at current
  price levels. On the other hand, liquid hydrogen based on renewable energy is
  the only candidate aviation fuel known today that would completely eliminate
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emission by aviation. Safety issues in the siting of storage and handling
  systems at airports pose significant challenges, however. </p>
<p>It is very unlikely that military aircraft will ever use any fuel except current
  kerosene-type fuels, for reasons of logistics and the desire to have one fuel
  for all aircraft and ground equipment. </p>
<h3>7.8.5. Summary<a name="785"></a></h3>
<p>On balance, it appears that current types of aviation fuel will continue to
  be the preferred option for gas turbine powered aircraft. This situation could
  change if liquid hydrogen could be produced by an environmentally acceptable
  and economically competitive method or if the need to reduce CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions from
  aviation becomes overwhelming. Aircraft now consume about 2.5% of all fossil
  fuels burned; therefore, they are not major contributors to anthropogenic CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  discharged into the atmosphere. Future aviation demand growth rates are discussed
  in <a href="118.htm">Chapter 8</a>. The only emissions that are directly influenced
  by fuel type are CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, and SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O. </p>
<p>The properties of aviation fuels are controlled within fairly narrow limits,
  and allowable variations can have very little impact on exhaust emissions, with
  one exception-removal of sulfur. The sulfur content in jet fuel currently averages
  about 0.05% worldwide, well below the specification allowance of 0.3%. In the
  United States, sulfur content has been increasing slightly since 1990, but it
  appears relatively stable in Western Europe and probably the rest of the world.
  Sulfur will probably remain at this level for the foreseeable future unless
  it is legislated downward. The penalty for removing sulfur from petroleum-derived
  jet fuel would be about a 0.1% increase in CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions attributable to the
  aircraft sector as a result of the need to manufacture additional hydrogen;
  there would be no CO<span class="subscript">2</span> penalty if the hydrogen came from a renewable energy source
  or if nuclear power were used to extract it from water. </p>
<p>Sulfur-free kerosene can be produced by F-T processes from synthesis gas that
  could be produced from natural gas, coal, or biomass. The economics of these
  processes are improving. F-T jet fuel produced from biomass-derived synthesis
  gas would be essentially CO<span class="subscript">2</span>-neutral. </p>
<p>Alternative fuels to kerosene that appear to be environmentally friendly have
  been identified; even if these benefits can be verified, however, introduction
  of such fuels will be hindered by significant technical problems in adapting
  these fuels to current aircraft designs and airport infrastructures. Using current
  technology, such changes would increase CO<span class="subscript">2</span> released to the atmosphere. </p>
<p>Alternative liquid fuels appear to offer little promise. Alcohols are not compatible
  with the fuel systems of current aircraft and will suffer significant range
  penalties as a result of lower heats of combustion. The use of esters of vegetable
  oils is limited to 2% at most before fuel blends fail freezing-point requirements.
  Burning alcohols and esters would increase emissions of CO, hydrocarbons, organic
  acids, and aldehydes. </p>
<p>The introduction of any cryogenic fuel would require the design and development
  of a new fleet of aircraft, as well as a new supporting infrastructure for the
  storage and handling of such fuel at airports. Cryogenic fuels are not compatible
  with the fueling systems of current aircraft, and their lower energy density
  would require much larger fuel tanks than on current aircraft. Studies have
  shown that cryogenic hydrogen could be a viable alternative to kerosene with
  significant reductions in greenhouse effects for long-range commercial aircraft
  if design and infrastructure problems can be solved. </p>
