<h2><b>7.2. Aircraft Characteristics </b></h2>
<p>Commercial aviation has seen many technology breakthroughs over the past 40
  years. Over that period, propeller-driven aircraft were replaced by jet-powered
  aircraft of the early 1960s, then by turbofan-powered aircraft of the 1970s
  to 1990s. As more powerful and fuel efficient powerplants were developed, matching
  baseline airframe improvements in aerodynamics and net weight reductions were
  also achieved. The driving forces for these improvements were, and continue
  to be, demand for increased range, better fuel efficiency, greater capacity,
  and increased speed-all of which have positive impacts on aircraft markets and
  economics. In many cases, these same characteristics have direct and beneficial
  influences on the impact of aircraft on the environment. </p>
<h3><b>7.2.1. Aircraft Design: Background<a name="721"></a></b></h3>
<p>Design of a subsonic transport aircraft begins by establishing its range requirements
  and the number of passengers it needs to carry. Economic and technical parameters
  have to be considered with projected market conditions to arrive at design goals.
  Having established these goals, the aerodynamic design can begin. One of the
  most important elements is the wing. Wing shape determines that lift is produced
  in the most efficient and stable manner for each flight mode. During take-off
  and landing, flaps on the leading and trailing edges of the wing are deployed
  to generate the extra lift required at the slower speed. As the airflow airspeed
  increases during the climb, these devices are retracted, and the wing assumes
  the optimum shape for higher cruise speeds. Forward flight generates "drag,"
  which is manifest in several forms. One is the drag produced by the lift (induced
  drag). This induced drag varies directly with lift produced. Another is the
  resistance of the air as it flows over the outer surfaces of the aircraft (termed
  zero lift drag), which is independent of lift. Sub-components of zero lift drag
  include skin-friction drag, form drag, roughness or excrescence drag, and interference
  drag caused by interaction effects of various parts of the aircraft. These drag
  components, of course, are balanced by the thrust of the engines.</p>
<p>Lift and drag components also create other forces that are controlled by vertical
  and horizontal tail surfaces, thus enabling the aircraft to be flown accurately.
  These control surfaces also provide the means to trim the aircraft in level
  flight, minimizing control inputs during steady parts of the flight profile.
  In addition to these controls, sections of the trailing edge of the main wing
  are hinged to form movable control surfaces to control the lateral roll of the
  aircraft about its longitudinal axis. </p>
<p>All such surfaces and associated maneuvering add, in small measure, to the
  overall energy required to propel the aircraft forward. A detailed knowledge
  of the aerodynamic processes involved is therefore called for if this energy
  is to be minimized. </p>
<p>A well-established equation used in the design process is the Breguet Range
  Equation (Corning, 1977). The equation provides a basis for comparisons of competing
  designs by taking into account all of the principal variables-take-off and landing
  weights, thrust/fuel flow, aerodynamics and speed, as well as mission requirements
  and passenger load-and providing a figure of merit for the efficiency for each
  candidate design. </p>
