<H2><b>2.2. Impacts of Present Aviation on Atmospheric Composition</b></H2>
<h3><b><a name="221"></a>2.2.1. Modeling Changes in Atmospheric Ozone from Present
  Aviation</b></h3>
<p>Because of the substantial chemical and dynamic differences between the stratosphere
  and the troposphere, individual atmospheric models have tended to focus on one
  or the other of the regions. This separation has worked well in addressing primarily
  stratospheric issues such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and tropospheric issues
  such as regional pollution. Subsonic aircraft emissions, insofar as they are
  injected into the interface between the two atmospheric regions, present a particularly
  complex modeling challenge. To date, almost all model studies of subsonic aircraft
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> effects have been conducted with models that emphasize tropospheric chemistry;
  few contain an explicit representation of stratospheric chemistry. Most of the
  following discussion will center on those efforts. However, two models of the
  stratosphere-the Atmospheric Environmental Research (AER) and Commonwealth Scientific
  and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) models used in <a href="044.htm">Chapter
  4</a>-have calculated stratospheric ozone responses to 1992 subsonic fleet emissions
  of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. We discuss these results in <a href="026.htm#2212">Section 2.2.1.2</a>
  and use them in conjunction with the tropospheric model results to arrive at
  a total atmospheric impact of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from present subsonic aviation.

<p>Recognition of the importance of heterogeneous chemical processes has increased
  steadily over the past 10 years; all atmospheric models now contain at least
  some of the gas-surface interactions identified in laboratory studies. However,
  relatively few global atmospheric models represent aerosol microphysics in a
  way that allows for simulation of the impacts of aircraft aerosols on atmospheric
  particle densities and surface areas. As a consequence, there has not yet been
  much effort directed at modeling the effects of aircraft particle emissions
  on atmospheric ozone. We evaluate one such study in <a href="026.htm#2213">Section
  2.2.1.3</a>. </p>
<h4><i><a name="2211"></a>2.2.1.1. Effects of Aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> Emisions on Tropospheric
  Ozone </i></h4>
<p>Model studies of the impact of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from aviation on ozone levels
  in the UT and LS have been performed with increasing sophistication since the
  1970s. Most studies set up a base case without aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions and a
  perturbed case with the aircraft source added. Differences in atmospheric composition
  and, ultimately, radiative forcing between the two cases are attributed to the
  influence of aircraft emissions. There are detailed differences among the many
  model studies that arise because of differences in the aircraft emission inventories
  employed. There are, however, many other more crucial differences in the model
  studies: The extent and accuracy of the treatment of atmospheric chemistry processes;
  the treatment of other NO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources besides aircraft; the treatment of dispersion,
  transport, and advection of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> species; and the adequacy of the treatment of
  the underpinning description of the coupled chemistry and the global atmospheric
  circulation in the UT and LS. </p>
<p>Many of the model studies note that the bulk of aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from
  subsonic aviation occurs in an atmospheric region that is sensitive to these
  emissions. Because of low background NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels-typically 50-200 ppt-in the
  mid-latitude UT and LS, high NO/NO<span class="subscript">2</span> ratios, and low HO<span class="subscript">x</span> concentrations, ozone
  production (in terms of ozone molecules) per NO<span class="subscript">x</span> molecule is more efficient
  here than anywhere else in the atmosphere. Because the greenhouse blanketing
  produced by a given atmospheric ozone increment is directly proportional to
  the temperature contrast between radiation absorbed and radiation emitted, radiative
  forcing efficiency is greatest for ozone changes near the tropopause (Lacis
  et al., 1990), though its climate sensitivity may have a different response
  (Hansen et al., 1997).</p>

<p>In completing our assessment of ozone impacts from present subsonic aircraft
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions, we have gathered results from 48 model studies, which are listed
  in the bibliography at the end of the chapter. In each case, the model results
  have been normalized by the assumed global aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission source strength
  and put on the common basis of 0.5 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>. There are, however, differences
  in the spatial distributions used in these inventories, and local NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and ozone
  concentration impacts will not necessarily scale accurately with global emission
  source strength. Despite this important reservation, global emission source
  strength is a useful index in a first examination of the model results. </p>
<p> Based on these results, we conclude that subsonic aviation has impacts on
  atmospheric composition in the principal traffic areas at 9-13 km altitude,
  30-60ï¿½N latitude, averaged over chemically significant time scales of up to
  a few days. These impacts may be summarized as follows for normalized NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  of 0.5 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>: </p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <p>Significant local increases in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels, by up to hundreds of ppt <br>
      Significant local increases in ozone, by up to 12 ppb, over a region including
      air traffic corridors and polewards of them, averaged over available calculations
      for January and July <br>
      Ozone increases of 2-14%, at their maximum in July, downstream and extending
      to the north of principal traffic areas, reflecting the long atmospheric
      lifetime of ozone in the UT and LS <br>
      Ratios of ozone increments to NO<span class="subscript">x</span> increments on the order of 100, reflecting
      the high efficiency of the ozone production cycle in the UT and LS <br>
      Globally averaged ozone inventory increases of 3-10 Tg, or 1-3%, up to an
      altitude of about 15 km<br>
      Increases in tropospheric hydroxyl radical inventories of 0.3-3% globally
      up to an altitude of about 15 km. </p>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Despite improvements in the realism with which processes have been represented
  in the models, the increase in dimensionality from 2-D to 3-D has not been accompanied
  by a change in the likely magnitude of local NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and ozone changes anticipated
  from aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions, when normalized by the assumed aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission
  to 0.5 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup> (<a href="026.htm#img23">Figure 2-3</a>). </p>
<p>The original 2-D (altitude-latitude) model studies of the tropospheric ozone
  impacts of subsonic NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions are close to the (mean + 1xsd) line from the
  entire ensemble of studies. 2-D model estimates have declined steadily so that
  by 1992 they were close to the (mean - 1xsd) line. The original 1-D studies
  showed a large amount of scatter and have not been used extensively for assessment
  purposes for the past decade or so. 2-D channel (altitude-longitude) models
  have been applied to the aircraft assessment as an interim strategy prior to
  3-D (altitude-latitude-longitude) model development. 2-D channel model results
  are toward the high end of the range of results.</p>
<p>3-D models have been employed increasingly from 1994 onward, with the results
  lying toward the low end of the overall spread of model results. 3-D model results
  still show a considerable amount of scatter, and there is no evidence that the
  move from 2-D to 3-D models or the selection of 3-D models in <a href="044.htm">Chapter
  4</a> has improved inter-model consistency or overall predictive confidence.
  Regardless of how 2-D model results compare with zonally averaged 3-D model
  results, a crucial advantage of 3-D models is that they can account for zonal
  asymmetries and, in principle, be evaluated more decisively against local observations.
  Consequently, more confidence can be gained in their predictive capabilities
  for aircraft assessments (see Sections <a href="028.htm#2311">2.3.1.1</a> and
  <a href="028.htm#2312">2.3.1.2</a>). </p>
<p>Based on all model results compiled for this assessment, our estimate of the
  likely ozone increase at its maximum in the principal traffic areas-9-13 km
  altitude, 30-60&#176;N latitude-from 1992 subsonic aviation and during summer is
  about 6%, or 8 ppb, for a global aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission of 0.5 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup> (1.65
  Tg NO<span class="subscript">x</span> as NO<span class="subscript">2</span> yr<sup>-1</sup>; see <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a>). </p>
<p><a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> focuses attention on the development of future
  scenarios for subsonic aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions; six 3-D global models have been
  employed to assess future impacts of subsonic aircraft. <a href="026.htm#tab21">Table
  2-1</a> shows ozone changes calculated in some of these models for 1992 subsonic
  operations compared with model results presented in previous studies. The latest
  model results in <a href="026.htm#tab21">Table 2-1</a> appear to lie well within
  the central range of estimates from previous studies. </p>
<p>The estimates in <a href="026.htm#tab21">Table 2-1</a> can be compared with
  previous assessments of the likely ozone impacts of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from present
  aviation. The WMO-UNEP (1995) assessment described model results available to
  the end of 1993 as preliminary and indicative of maximum ozone increases of
  4-12% at around 10 km for 30-50ï¿½N. The above estimates encompass a narrower
  range than that given in the WMO-UNEP (1995) assessment and suggest that the
  true value is at the lower end of previous estimates. An assessment prepared
  for the European Commission (Brasseur et al., 1998) concluded that the current
  fleet of commercial aircraft should have increased NO<span class="subscript">x</span> abundances by 50-100
  ppt near 200 hPa, with a corresponding increase in ozone concentrations of 5-9
  ppb (i.e., 4-8%), during summertime. This latter range is consistent with the
  range identified in the present study, based on the five selected 3-D models.

<p>2-D models have been developed extensively over the past decade in response
  to the need for credible predictions of CFC impacts on stratospheric ozone and
  more recently for understanding the effects of future supersonic (high speed
  civil transport, or HSCT) aircraft fleets. Emphasis in these models has been
  placed on ClO<span class="subscript">x</span>, HO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> chemistry in the 20-40 km region of the atmosphere,
  where the CFC and HSCT effects are expected to be manifested. Model calculations
  for the 1992 subsonic aircraft fleet have been performed by the AER and CSIRO
  2-D models, described in detail in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>. For these
  calculations, the models have used the approach described in <a href="026.htm#2211">Section
  2.2.1.1</a>; namely, they have set up a base case without aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  and a perturbed case with the aircraft source added. They also have both used
  the subsonic fleet emission inventory described in <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a>.
  The results of the two studies are in close agreement and yield the following
  conclusions: </p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <p>Approximately 20% of subsonic emissions are released directly into the
      stratosphere; this result is on the low end of empirically based estimates,
      resulting in roughly a 1% increase in summertime NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels existing just
      above the tropopause at 45ï¿½N latitude. <br>
      The aircraft-induced increase in lowermost stratospheric NO<span class="subscript">x</span> causes an increase
      in ozone. Peak ozone increases are approximately 0.5% at northern mid-latitudes
      and at altitudes immediately above the tropopause. The total column ozone
      change resulting from stratospheric aircraft emissions is approximately
      0.1%. <br>
      A very small amount of aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is transported to altitudes above 22
      km, where it acts to decrease ozone concentrations slightly. </p>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4><i><a name="2213"></a>2.2.1.3. Effects of Aircraft Aerosol Emissions</i></h4>
<p>A number of previous model studies have examined the effects of HSCT sulfate 
  aerosols on stratospheric chemistry; several new studies are discussed in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 
  4</a>. A key uncertainty in these calculations has been the degree to which 
  emitted sulfur forms submicron sulfate particles in the aircraft plume (see 
  <a href="035.htm">Section 3.2.3</a>). As part of the <a href="044.htm">Chapter 
  4</a> studies, the AER and UNIVAQ stratospheric models have calculated the response 
  of stratospheric ozone to the subsonic fleet (year 2015) for a range of assumed 
  SO<span class="subscript">2</span>-to-particle conversion efficiencies. Details 
  of those studies appear in <a href="051.htm#4412">Section 4.4.1.2</a>. A rough 
  estimate of the effect of sulfur emissions from the 1992 fleet can be made by 
  scaling the 2015 results to 1992 emission levels. This calculation results in 
  an estimate for the column ozone change at 45&#176;N of approximately -0.1%. 
</p>
<p>The potential role of subsonic aircraft-generated soot in stratospheric ozone
  depletion has been investigated by Bekki (1997) using a 2-D model that includes
  heterogeneous reactions of HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>, NO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and ozone on soot. Using modeled aircraft
  soot aerosol distributions that were broadly consistent with observations, the
  model yields increased losses of ozone (approximately -0.2% column change at
  45&#176;N for the 1992 fleet) relative to the same model without soot chemistry.
  Moreover, inclusion of soot chemistry improves model agreement with the observed
  trend in LS ozone depletion. However, recent laboratory measurements indicating
  that soot is a reaction consumable do not support a major assumption of the
  Bekki model that soot acts as a catalyst. </p>

</table>
<p>The degree to which soot consumption affects the Bekki calculations can be
  estimated as follows: If the heterogeneous reaction between ozone and soot proceeds
  at the highest reported rate (the one used in the Bekki calculation), namely
  g(O<span class="subscript">3</span>) = 3.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup> (Stephens et al., 1986; Fendel et al., 1995; Rogaski et al.,
  1997), the time required to consume the mass of soot present in the stratosphere
  would be approximately 10 minutes. It is important to note that this result
  is independent of the soot surface-to-volume ratio; it depends only upon the
  ozone concentration, which is taken to be 1011 cm<sup>-3</sup> at 10-km altitude. At this
  reaction rate, only 5 hours would be required to consume the entire soot particulate
  population at 10 km (assuming 5 x 107 carbon atoms cm<sup>-3</sup> at a soot loading of
  1 ng m<sup>-3</sup>) and cause the effective soot-ozone reaction rate to drop to zero.</p>
<p> Laboratory evidence suggests that the soot-ozone reaction rate decreases after
  consumption and alteration of the top surface carbon layer (Stephens et al.,
  1986). Small reported laboratory g values-on the order of 3.0 x 10<sup>-5</sup>-likely
  reflect the reaction rate associated with a "deactivated" laboratory soot surface.
  Using this value for g, the time required to consume individual particles of
  soot would be less than a day, and the time to consume all atmospheric soot
  would be lengthened to approximately 3 weeks. Although this change in reaction
  rate extends the lifetime of atmospheric soot, it comes at the expense of the
  overall ozone destruction rate. Accordingly, our analysis indicates that the
  massof soot in the UT and LS does not seem to be sufficient to quantitatively
  affect ozone, regardless of the reaction rate chosen.</p>
<p>In support of this conclusion, we note that in situ measurements in the engine
  exhaust of a Concorde supersonic aircraft in the LS have been used recently
  to constrain heterogeneous reaction rates on soot particles in a plume model
  (Gao et al., 1998). Gao et al. inferred low reactivity for the ozone-soot interaction;
  coupled with the measured abundance of the soot aerosol, Gao et al. reach the
  same conclusion that we derived from our qualititative arguments. In summary,
  the few model calculations performed suggest that subsonic aircraft sulfate
  and soot emissions in the stratosphere act as substrates for ozone depletion.
  The magnitude of the depletions is likely to be small relative to ozone increases
  from NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions, but the depletions are highly uncertain because of the poorstate
  of understanding and model development relative to aerosol chemistry. </p>
