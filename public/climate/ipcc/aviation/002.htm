<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>Following a request from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
  to assess the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft engines,
  the IPCC at its Twelfth Session (Mexico City . 11-13 September 1996) decided
  to produce this Special Report, Aviation and the Global Atmosphere, in collaboration
  with the Scientific Assessment Panel to the Montreal Protocol. The task was
  initially a joint responsibility between IPCC Working Groups I and II but, following
  a change in the terms of reference of the Working Groups (Thirteenth Session
  of the IPCC . Maldives . 22 and 25-28 September 1997), the responsibility was
  transferred to IPCC Working Groups I and III, with administrative support remaining
  with the Technical Support Units of Working Groups I and II. </p>
<p>Although it is less than 100 years since the first powered flight, the aviation
  industry has undergone rapid growth and has become an integral and vital part
  of modern society. In the absence of policy intervention, the growth is likely
  to continue. It is therefore highly relevant to consider the current and possible
  future effects of aircraft engine emissions on the atmosphere. A unique aspect
  of this report is the integral involvement of technical experts from the aviation
  industry, including airlines, and airframe and engine manufacturers, alongside
  atmospheric scientists. This involvement has been critical in producing what
  we believe is the most comprehensive assessment available to date of the effects
  of aviation on the global atmosphere. Although this Special Report is the first
  IPCC report to consider a particular industrial subsector, other sectors equally
  deserve study. </p>
<p>The report considers all the gases and particles emitted by aircraft into the
  upper atmosphere and the role that they play in modifying the chemical properties
  of the atmosphere and initiating the formation of condensation trails (contrails)
  and cirrus clouds. The report then considers (a) how the radiative properties
  of the atmosphere can be modified as a result, possibly leading to climate change,
  and (b) how the ozone layer could be modified, leading to changes in ultraviolet
  radiation reaching the Earth's surface. The report also considers how potential
  changes in aircraft technology, air transport operations, and the institutional,
  regulatory, and economic framework might affect emissions in the future. The
  report does not deal with the effects of engine emissions on local air quality
  near the surface. </p>
<p>The objective of this Special Report is to provide accurate, unbiased, policy-relevant
  information to serve the aviation industry and the expert and policymaking communities.
  The report, in describing the current state of knowledge, also identifies areas
  where our understanding is inadequate and where further work is urgently required.
  It does not make policy recommendations or suggest policy preferences, thus
  is consistent with IPCC practice. </p>
<p>This report was compiled by 107 Lead Authors from 18 countries. Successive
  drafts of the report were circulated for review by experts, followed by review
  by governments and experts. Over 100 Contributing Authors submitted draft text
  and information to the Lead Authors and over 150 reviewers submitted valuable
  suggestions for improvement during the review process. All the comments received
  were carefully analyzed and assimilated into a revised document for consideration
  at the joint session of IPCC Working Groups I and III held in San Josï¿½, Costa
  Rica, 12-14 April 1999. There, the Summary for Policymakers was approved in
  detail and the underlying report accepted. </p>
<p>We wish to express our sincere appreciation to the Report Coordinators, David
  Lister and Joyce Penner; to all the Coordinating Lead Authors, Lead Authors,
  and Review Editors whose expertise, diligence, and patience have underpinned
  the successful completion of this report; and to the many contributors and reviewers
  for their valuable and painstaking dedication and work. We thank the Steering
  Committee for their wise counsel and guidance throughout the preparation of
  the report. We are grateful to: </p>
<ul>
  <li> ICAO for hosting the initial scoping meeting for the report and the final
    drafting meeting, and for translating the Summary for Policymakers into Arabic,
    Chinese, French, Russian, and Spanish (ICAO also provided technical inputs
    as requested)</li>
  <li>The government of Trinidad and Tobago for hosting the first drafting meeting</li>
  <li>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) for hosting the second
    drafting meeting</li>
  <li>The government of Costa Rica for hosting the Joint Session of IPCC Working
    Groups I and III (12-14 April 1999), where the Summary for Policymakers was
    approved line by line and the underlying assessment accepted. </li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, we are grateful to John Crayston (ICAO), Steve Pollonais (government
  of Trinidad and Tobago), Leonie Dobbie (IATA), and Max Campos (government of
  Costa Rica) for their taking on the demanding burden of arranging for these
  meetings. </p>
<p>We also thank Anne Murrill of the Working Group I Technical Support Unit and
  Sandy MacCracken of the Working Group II Technical Support Unit for their tireless
  and good humored support throughout the preparation of the report. Other members
  of the Technical Support Units of Working Groups I and II also provided much
  assistance, including Richard Moss, Mack McFarland, Maria Noguer, Laura Van
  Wie McGrory, Neil Leary, Paul van der Linden, and Flo Ormond. The staff of the
  IPCC Secretariat, Rudie Bourgeois, Cecilia Tanikie, and Chantal Ettori, provided
  logistical support for all government liaison and travel of experts from the
  developing and transitional economy countries. <br>
