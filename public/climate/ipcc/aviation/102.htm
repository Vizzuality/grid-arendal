<h4>7.5.4.2 Near-Term Technology<a name="7542"></a></h4>
<h4>7.5.4.2.1. General issues<a name="75421"></a></h4>
<p>Heightened interest in engine emissions has had a considerable effect on the
  approach to combustor development over the past 25 years. As with other key
  fields of gas turbine technology, earlier dependence on semi-empirical and semi-analytical
  models has been lessened by advances in CFD methods of modeling and analyzing
  complex flow processes (Mongia, 1994, 1997a). Nevertheless, the complexity of
  the problems dictates that experimental verification is still required to demonstrate
  that the combustor meets all emissions, operational performance, and durability
  requirements. As experience and confidence in these approaches grow, the high
  costs of combustion system development might be contained-or even reduced slightly.
  At present, however, modeling is not expected to completely replace experimental
  testing, especially in the case of more advanced, low-emission concepts for
  which experience is limited. Thus, the pursuit of advances in combustor technology
  will remain a major part of the cost of any new engine. A summary of current
  modeling capabilities, limitations, and potential improvements is given elsewhere
  (Mongia, 1997a).</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>It is important to note that the intrinsic complexity of the combustion process
  and limitations of current analytical tools lead to considerable uncertainty
  in prediction of emissions from new combustor designs. Mongia (1997a) estimates
  that even with analytical models that have been "anchored" to measured data-a
  process to systematically calibrate a model so that it reproduces measured emissions
  results-prediction accuracy is only about ±15% for NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and ±30% for CO and HC.
  The uncertainty in prediction is even higher for smoke. </p>
<p>One of the clear lessons that emerged from early emissions reduction programs
  was that changes to reduce NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions could produce adverse effects on other
  performance characteristics, leading toward tradeoffs in design. Tradeoffs can
  be attributed to the engine cycle selected or the combustor design itself. Tradeoffs
  based on engine cycle reflect changes in overall pressure and bypass ratios,
  which, in turn, affect fuel burn rates and the conditions at which combustion
  occurs (see <a href="096.htm">Section 7.4.1.1</a>). Tradeoffs generated by design
  changes affecting the combustor can influence major combustor performance parameters,
  including operability, reliability, durability, efficiency, and noise-all of
  which must be taken into account during engine development. </p>

<p>More fuel efficient, high bypass engines reduce not only CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, but also
  HC and CO emissions. For a given combustor design, however, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> formation rates
  rise as a result of higher air pressures and temperatures. Thus, despite the
  reduction in the amount of fuel that can form NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, the increased formation rate
  can result in a net rise in the mass output of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. This result is shown clearly
  in <a href="101.htm#img717">Figure 7-17</a> (Rudey, 1975). Many earlier researchers
  have suggested that the only way the more basic tradeoff between CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  could be altered was by finding satisfactory ways of reducing fuel-rich zones
  without compromising stability, and reducing the residence time of burning gases
  in the combustor without compromising exit temperature profiles or pattern factors.
</p>
<p>This important NO<span class="subscript">x</span>-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> (fuel) tradeoffs issue has been summarized as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"There is no single relationship between NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> that holds for all engine
    types. However for the best current aircraft engine and combustor design technologies,
    there is a direct link between the emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and CO<span class="subscript">2</span>. As the temperatures
    and pressures in the combustors are increased to obtain better fuel efficiency,
    emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> increase, unless there is also a change in combustor technology."
    (ICCAIA, 1997b)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Improved low-emission combustor technology can alter the precise tradeoff between
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. Theoretically, this technology can reduce NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels at any pressure
  ratio. However, for any currently available aircraft engine combustor technology,
  there will still be some tradeoff between CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, although it will be at
  lower NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels. Even with very advanced combustor technologies that minimize
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> formation by premixing fuel and air to control combustion temperatures,
  there is a tradeoff between CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> as a result of high combustor exit temperatures
  associated with advanced, highly efficient engines.</p>
<p>A further NO<span class="subscript">x</span>-related issue arises from a common practice adopted by industry.
  In recent years, there have been numerous occasions when operators have sought
  to increase the capacity (passenger numbers or weight) or range of an existing
  airplane. A highly cost- and time-effective response to such requirements is
  to increase the thrust level of an existing engine type. This response has led
  to a type of development usually referred to as a "throttle push" or "throttle
  bend" of the core engine. This approach invariably entails increasing overall
  engine pressure ratio and results in higher combustor inlet pressures and temperatures,
  thus higher NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels at high power levels. However, analytical studies (ICCAIA,
  1997d) of engine growth characteristics have shown that the rate at which the
  mass formation rate of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> increases as the "throttle bend" technique is used
  to increase thrust is similar to data measured on a wide range of engine families
  over a significant range of engine operating pressure ratios (ICAO, 1995a).
  It is also worth noting that, in practice, the required thrust at cruise and
  measured cruise SFC remain essentially constant for the "throttle push" versions,
  resulting in increases in fuel efficiency levels as payloads and number of passengers
  have risen.</p>
<h4>7.5.4.2.2. Combustor design considerations<a name="75422"></a></h4>
<p>Current combustors can contribute little more to fuel efficiency because at
  power levels above "idle" the energy conversion level is virtually 100% (see
  <a href="101.htm#tab74">Tables 7-4</a> and <a href="101.htm#tab75">7-5</a>).
  However, superimposed on all combustor design considerations is the continuing
  underlying requirement that low emissions features must not compromise basic
  combustion requirements or have any significant effect on engine performance.
  In recent years, this requirement has imposed difficult problems in introducing
  new emissions reductions features. <a href="101.htm#tab74">Table 7-4</a> provides
  a list of basic requirements, and <a href="101.htm#tab75">Table 7-5</a> highlights
  options and compromises that designers have had to face. </p>
<p><a href="102.htm#img718">Figure 7-18</a> provides a qualitative indication
  of the development process as engineers work to reconcile the combustion system
  constraints listed in <a href="101.htm#tab74">Tables 7-4</a> and <a href="101.htm#tab75">7-5</a>
  and the operational requirements of the engine.</p>
<h4>7.5.4.2.3. Achievements<a name="75423"></a></h4>
<p>Low-emissions combustors currently fall into two categories. The first category
  is composed of existing combustors, which have incorporated relatively minor
  changes to liner and/or fuel nozzle designs to improve emissions. Recent examples
  of changes that have been quite successful in reducing NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions are shown
  in <a href="102.htm#img719">Figure 7-19</a>.</p>
<p>The NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions of state-of-the-art combustors are 20-40% lower than those
  of older combustors. <a href="102.htm#img720">Figures 7-20</a>, <a href="102.htm#img721">7-21</a>,
  and <a href="102.htm#img722">7-22</a> provide evidence of some of the progress
  that has been made in recent years to avoid what had earlier appeared to be
  an unavoidable link between lower NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions and relatively high CO and HC
  emissions. In these examples, relatively minor changes to the combustor's airflow
  pattern and the location of fuel injection resulted in reduced CO/HC without
  a NO<span class="subscript">x</span> penalty.</p>
<p>Although this category of improvement entails relatively minor changes, the
  development and engine recertification process remains a long one. Because safety
  is the overriding concern in aviation, the time and cost to introduce a change
  can be considerable. Safety considerations can also constrain application of
  new combustor designs to new engines. For example, a new combustor design is
  often introduced as a package that includes modifications to the combustion
  chamber, fuel nozzles, and engine control. Positive steps must be in place to
  prevent intermixing of new and old components during maintenance. Of course,
  other requirements-such as durability, weight, maintenance, and cost-must also
  be balanced during product introduction. This first technology "category" can
  also include improvements in other engine components, such as the engine turbomachinery,
  with or without concurrent combustor changes. Such improvements alone can lead
  to better fuel efficiency along with lower peak cycle temperatures, thereby
  reducing NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions and improving durability. </p>
<p>The second category of near-term advances involves major changes such as introduction
  of "staged" combustors (see <a href="102.htm#img723">Figure 7-23</a>). Staging
  was introduced to improve or provide an additional degree of freedom between
  operational and emissions requirements. Thus, the high-power stage of a combustor
  optimized for low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> does not have to cope with low-power stability requirements,
  which are dealt with by bringing in other parts of the staged combustor when
  needed. Staged combustors, however, do require more complex control systems,
  incorporating fail-safe operation, to ensure that transient engine performance
  is not affected. This requirement is especially crucial for the most recent
  advances in low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> technology, which rely on low temperature, lean combustion
  to achieve low NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. Staged systems can present problems in achieving acceptable
  combustor exit temperature profiles, with associated losses in turbine efficiency,
  thus fuel efficiency. They are also heavier. Together, the complex interaction
  of improvements and penalties translates into a form of tradeoff between NO<span class="subscript">x</span>,
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and HC/CO; work in this field continues to define designs that minimize
  penalties and maximize benefits.</p>
<p>The only example of a staged combustor in aircraft service today is the dual
  annular combustor (DAC), which is shown in <a href="102.htm#img723">Figure 7-23a</a>.
  The DAC is a staged system that incorporates two separate combustion zones.
  The pilot stage provides good operational performance required at low power.
  The main stage provides low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions at high power. Low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions are
  achieved with lean fuel/air mixtures, which reduce flame temperatures, and high
  throughput velocities, which reduce the residence time available to form NO<span class="subscript">x</span>.
  Relative to current state-of-the-art NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels discussed above, a single annular
  combustor in an engine having a pressure ratio of approximately 30 achieves
  about 30% reduction in LTO NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions, as shown in <a href="102.htm#img719">Figure
  7-19</a>, and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels are about 40% below CAEP/2 standards (ICAO, 1993).
  However, these improvements do not come without some tradeoffs. For example,
  <a href="102.htm#img720">Figure 7-20</a> (Mongia, 1997b) compares CO and NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  emissions for the conventional baseline combustor and the DAC. Both combustors
  fall on approximately the same line, indicating an apparent increase in CO with
  reduced NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. The DAC system is also more complex. To obtain requisite staging
  capability, the engine must be equipped with a full authority digital electronic
  control (FADEC) system. The FADEC system must deal with increased complexity
  of engine operation to accommodate the various staging modes and associated
  engine responses. The added complexity invariably involves additional development
  effort for any new application to ensure the achievement of acceptable ground-level
  and altitude starting, combustion efficiency, and turbine inlet temperature
  patterns. The NO<span class="subscript">x</span> benefit is reduced in higher pressure ratio engines because
  of the increased competition for airflow to meet the conflicting requirements
  of durability and emissions.</p>

<p>The incorporation of such a staged combustion system into an existing engine
  type requires changes to several parts of the high-pressure section of the engine,
  including the compressor outlet diffuser, combustor case, and inner structure.
  Major changes in the fuel control and fuel delivery system are also required.
  Additional modifications to the turbine may also be needed to accommodate changing
  temperature patterns during staged operation. Thus, the center and aft sections
  of the engine, which account for a major fraction of the cost of an engine,
  may be significantly different from the same engine with a current technology
  combustor. There may also be increases in weight, maintenance cost, and fuel
  burn. Several in-service engine models incorporate single burning zone unstaged
  combustors that employ limited fuel staging to maintain lean blow out performance
  at low power and operate at reduced NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels at high power.</p>

<p>Retrofitting an older engine model with one of these advanced combustors is
  technically feasible. However, it could involve not only replacement of the
  existing combustor but also replacement of almost all other elements of the
  engine core. Estimates suggest (ICCAIA, 1997c) that retrofit could incur a cost
  of about one-third the price of a new engine, even if it were accomplished during
  a standard hot section overhaul. In some cases, aircraft systems and components
  such as cockpit indication elements, auto throttle, flight management computer,
  and FADEC interfaces could be affected. It now seems more likely that both categories
  of combustion system improvement will be considered only for application in
  new production engine units.</p>
