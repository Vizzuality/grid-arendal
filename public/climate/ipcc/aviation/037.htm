<h3><b>3.3.5. Soot </b></h3>
<p>The primary atmospheric source of soot or black carbon particles is combustion
  of fossil fuels and biomass burning at the Earth's surface, with total emission
  values near 12 Tg C yr<sup>-1</sup> (Liousse et al., 1996). This value exceeds reasonable
  estimates of the aircraft source of black carbon by several orders of magnitude
  (Bekki, 1997). For example, aircraft are estimated to have emitted 0.0015 to
  0.015 Tg C as soot into the atmosphere in 1992 [with EI(soot) of 0.01 to 0.1
  g C/kg fuel] (Friedl, 1997; Rahmes et al., 1998). As in the case of sulfate
  aerosol, deposition and scavenging of black carbon near surface sources creates
  large vertical gradients in the lower atmosphere, with soot concentrations falling
  by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude between the surface and the lower stratosphere
  (Penner et al., 1992; Cooke and Wilson, 1996; Liousse et al., 1996). A possible
  meteoritic source of soot in the lower stratosphere has been considered but
  is not well quantified at present (Chuan and Woods, 1984). </p>

<p>Few direct measurements of soot abundance are available in the upper troposphere
  and lower stratosphere. The most extensive measurements in these regions are
  from aircraft impactor measurements (Pueschel et al., 1992, 1997; Blake and
  Kato, 1995). The accuracy of such measurements depends on knowledge of the impactor
  for small soot particles. The results (<a href="036.htm#img310">Figure 3-10</a>)
  are considered to represent a lower limit for soot number and mass because of
  size-selective sampling and because of scavenging of soot by background aerosol
  particles. Features of the measurements include a large gradient between the
  Northern and Southern Hemispheres and large variability with altitude at northern
  mid-latitudes. The large vertical variability of soot at northern mid-latitudes
  cannot be explained by the accumulation of aircraft soot emissions. With typical
  soot mass densities observed to be approximately 1 ng m<sup>-3</sup>, soot is estimated
  to represent approximately 0.01% of the stratospheric aerosol mass (Pueschel
  et al., 1992). In other sampling flights over southern Germany, measurements
  of absorbing mass (probably soot) at 8-12 km altitude and partly within cirrus
  clouds showed concentrations above 10 ng m<sup>-3</sup>, with higher values correlated
  with local aviation fuel consumption (Ström and Ohlsson, 1998). </p>
<p>Modeling studies of soot distribution in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere 
  differ on the importance of aircraft sources of soot. Some model simulations 
  suggest that ground-level sources of soot (12 Tg C yr<sup>-1</sup>) are as important 
  as aircraft sources in the upper troposphere and predict maximum soot values 
  there [2 to 5 ng m<sup>-3</sup> in Liousse et al. (1996) and 10 to 50 ng m<sup>-3</sup> 
  in Cooke and Wilson (1996)] that exceed observed values near 200 hPa at northern 
  mid-latitudes (Pueschel et al., 1997). Other model results show that current 
  aircraft could be a noticeable source of the soot near the tropopause at northern 
  mid-latitudes (Bekki, 1997; Danilin et al., 1998; Rahmes et al., 1998). Tracer 
  simulation results from the AER 2-D model (<a href="039.htm#351">Section 3.5.1</a>) 
  were multiplied by EI(soot) of 0.04 g/kg fuel (Döpelheuer, 1997) to estimate 
  the global distribution of soot. The results (<a href="037.htm#img311">Figure 
  3-11</a>) show maximum values of 0.6 ng m<sup>-3</sup> near 12 km at northern 
  mid-latitudes. These values are in the middle of the range of other model results 
  and are in the range of observed values (<a href="036.htm#img310">Figure 3-10</a>). 
  However, because the fleet-mean EI(soot) is uncertain and may range from 0.01 
  to 0.1 g/kg fuel, the effective range of the maximum in <a href="037.htm#img311">Figure 
  3-11</a> is 0.15 to 1.5 ng m<sup>-3</sup>. At 20 km, fuel tracer simulations 
  show aircraft-induced zonal mean soot perturbations to be approximately 100 
  times smaller than maximum observed values (<a href="036.htm#img310">Figure 
  3-10</a>). </p>
<p>Observations of soot in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere are too
  limited to provide an estimate of any long-term changes in soot concentrations
  in those regions. The possible consequences of heterogeneous reactions on soot
  (Bekki, 1997; Lary et al., 1997) are discussed in <a href="020.htm">Chapter
  2</a>. </p>
<h3> <b><i><a name="336"></a>3.3.6. Polar Stratospheric Clouds and Aircraft Emissions</i></b></h3>
<p> During winter in the polar regions, low temperatures lead to the formation
  of polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles, which contain H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>, HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>, and
  H<span class="subscript">2</span>O (e.g., WMO, 1995; Carslaw et al., 1997; Peter, 1997). PSCs activate chlorine,
  leading to significant seasonal ozone losses in the lower stratosphere, particularly
  in the Southern Hemisphere (WMO, 1995). PSC formation may be enhanced by the
  atmospheric accumulation of aircraft emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, and sulfate, as
  well as through direct formation in aircraft plumes in polar regions (<a href="034.htm">Section
  3.2</a> and <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>). If aircraft emissions change
  the frequency, abundance, or composition of PSCs, the associated ozone loss
  may also be modified (Peter et al., 1991; Arnold et al., 1992; Considine et
  al., 1994; Tie et al., 1996; Del Negro et al., 1997). The effects of subsonic
  aircraft emissions on PSCs and stratospheric ozone are expected to be smaller
  than those of similar emissions from supersonic aircraft because subsonic emissions
  occur in the 10- to 12-km region, whereas supersonic emissions will most likely
  occur in the 15- to 20-km region. Ambient temperatures in the 10- to 12-km region
  are usually too high (> 200 K) for PSCs to form with available H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>,
  and ozone and total inorganic chlorine concentrations are much lower than near
  20 km. </p>
<p> The impact of the subsonic fleet on PSC formation has not been well studied.
  The results of the fuel tracer simulation discussed in <a href="036.htm#334">Section
  3.3.4</a> can be used to estimate the increase of PSC SAD as a result of aircraft
  emissions of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. Assuming an EI(H<span class="subscript">2</span>O) of 1,230 g/kg, EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) of 15 g/kg,
  complete conversion of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> to HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>, and formation of NAT particles at threshold
  temperatures, AER model results for a 1992 subsonic fleet show an additional
  condensation of HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> on NAT particles ranging from 0.02 ppbv at 60°N to 0.12
  ppbv at 85°N at 20 km in January. These values provide an increase of 0.08 mm<sup>2</sup>
  cm<sup>-3</sup> in PSC SAD at 20 km and 85°N, assuming a unimodal distribution of PSC particles
  with diameter of 1 mm. The increase in spatial extent of PSCs both vertically
  and latitudinally is small in the model. PSC increases are very sensitive to
  background temperature, H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> values and will differ considerably among
  models. The increases are not likely to significantly alter ozone changes in
  polar winter because the SAD increases are much less than typical values of
  1-10 mm<sup>2</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> calculated for PSC events, and satellite data observations show
  that the probability of PSC formation below 14 km in the Arctic is generally
  very low (< 1%) (Poole and Pitts, 1994). </p>
<p>An important caveat related to the assessment of additional PSC formation as
  a result of aircraft emissions is that plume processes are not included. Global
  models generally assume that aircraft emissions are homogeneously distributed
  in a model grid box that is much larger than an aircraft plume. The consequences
  of this assumption have not yet been fully evaluated. In one model study, reactions
  on PSCs did not affect ozone chemistry in a subsonic plume at northern mid-latitudes
  in April (Danilin et al., 1994). A further caveat is that estimated PSC changes
  from aircraft emissions have not accounted for projected cooling of the stratosphere,
  which may enhance PSC formation. </p>
<p>The chemical implications of increased PSC formation for ozone chemistry and
  atmospheric composition are further discussed in <a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>.
  The effects of future aircraft fleets on additional PSC formation and subsequent
  ozone response are presented in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>. </p>
