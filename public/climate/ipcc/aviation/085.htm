<p>In the aircraft scenarios considered here, the relative amount of aviation 
  fuel burned in 1990 (2.4% of all fossil fuel carbon emissions) would increase 
  by 2050 to about 3% (Fa1) or more than 7% (Eab) depending on projections for 
  air traffic (see <a href="085.htm#img616a">Figure 6-16a</a>). For the other scenarios 
  here-with economic assumptions differing from the reference case IS92a, hence 
  a different demand for air transport-these fuel fractions in 2050 may be a factor 
  of 1.5 larger. In comparison, aviation was responsible in 1990 for about 3.5% 
  of total anthropogenic RF. This fraction would grow to about 5% in 2050 for 
  Fa1 and 10% for Eab. <a href="085.htm#img616b">Figure 6-16b</a> shows the evolution 
  of aviation RF from 1990 to 2050 for several scenarios as a percentage of total 
  IS92a RF. The climate change forced by aircraft, as measured by the summed RF, 
  is a larger proportion of total RF than indicated by fuel use alone. Thus, aviation 
  is an example of an industry for which the climate impacts of short-lived perturbations 
  such as O<font size="-2">3</font> and aerosols/clouds must be considered when 
  evaluating the sector as a whole. This effect is also demonstrated by RFI-the 
  ratio of summed RF to CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>-RF-which 
  is greater than 1 (see <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table 6-1</a>). </p>
<p>Each of the demand scenarios has a technology 2 option in which a 25% reduction
  in EI(NO<font size="-2">x</font>) (corresponding to a 22% reduction in total
  NO<font size="-2">x</font> emissions) is achieved at an additional fuel cost
  of about 3.5%. These options are calculated to have very little impact on total
  RF (<a href="068.htm#tab61">Table 6-1</a>) because the reduced O<font size="-2">3</font>-RF
  is offset by the increased CH<font size="-2">4</font>-RF and the small extra
  fuel burn CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>-RF). If the CH<font size="-2">4</font>
  perturbation is tied to the O<font size="-2">3</font> perturbation as the models
  now indicate, then the O<font size="-2">3</font>-RF and the CH<font size="-2">4</font>-RF
  nearly cancel, and efforts at NO<font size="-2">x</font> reduction may not be
  as effective in reducing RF as previously estimated when only ozone changes
  were considered. However, these opposing contributions to the radiative imbalance
  are very non-uniform in geographic extent, and the regional climate response
  may not simply disappear (see <a href="081.htm#651">Section 6.5.1</a>). Moreover,
  the prospect of large and canceling RFs, each with large independent uncertainties,
  greatly increases the probability of a large residual. </p>
<h3>6.6.4. The HSCT Option and Radiative Forcing<a name="664"></a></h3>
  The HSCT option of building a fleet beginning in 2015 and capping at 1,000
  aircraft in 2040 (scenario Fa1H) has significant impact on total aviation RF,
  as shown in <a href="083.htm#img615c">Figure 6-15c</a>. The addition of HSCT
  aircraft (+0.08 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>) increases RF for scenario Fa1
  by a factor of 1.4, becoming comparable to RF for the higher demand scenario
  Fe1 (see also <a href="085.htm#img616b">Figure 6-16b</a>). The HSCT aircraft
  themselves cause RF of +0.10 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>, which is offset only
  by -0.02 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> from displaced subsonic aircraft. This
  large RF from HSCT aircraft is driven mainly by RF from increased stratospheric
  H<font size="-2">2</font>O. This single component has a large uncertainty (at
  least a factor of 3) associated with the calculation of the stratospheric buildup
  of water and the value of RF. The differential CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>-RF
  penalty for HSCT aircraft is only 3% of total aviation RF. In conclusion, the
  best estimate of RF from HSCTs is about five times as large as RF from the subsonic
  fleet they replace; however, with the large confidence intervals on O<font size="-2">3</font>
  and H<font size="-2">2</font>O, this factor has a very large uncertainty and
  may range from 0 to 16.<br>
