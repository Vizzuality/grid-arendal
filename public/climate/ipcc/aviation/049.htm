<h2><b>4.3. Model Studies of Supersonic Aircraft </b></h2>
<p>This section contains an evaluation of the effects of supersonic engine effluent
  on stratospheric O<span class="subscript">3</span>, NOy, H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, and other trace constituents. The assessment
  of the potential future supersonic aircraft fleet was conducted primarily with
  2-D and 3-D CTMs. These global models are designed to represent the dynamic,
  chemical, and physical processes of the stratosphere. <a href="020.htm">Chapter
  2</a> discusses the validity of these models to accurately represent the present
  atmosphere. </p>
<p>Because these future aircraft have not yet been designed, we treat our study
  of supersonic aircraft in a parametric way. This assessment performed calculations
  for more than 50 supersonic scenarios and examined variables such as EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)
  and fleet size, ambient SAD and chlorine radical abundances, SO<span class="subscript">2</span> gas-to-particle
  conversion in the aircraft plume, cruise altitude sensitivity, and model cold
  aerosol chemistry representation. Results from this section are incorporated
  in Chapters <a href="054.htm">5</a> and <a href="063.htm">6</a>. </p>
<h3><i><b><a name="431"></a>4.3.1. Models Used in Supersonic Aircraft Assessment
  </b></i></h3>
<p>This section presents calculated responses of O<span class="subscript">3</span> to HSCT aircraft from nine
  numerical models of the stratosphere. These nine modeling groups have been responsible
  for most recent publications on the subject. We restrict our analysis to this
  set of results because it is difficult to compare model results unless the models
  are produced in the same way. For example, it is difficult to compare the results
  here with recent publications of Dameris et al. (1998) because they isolated
  the effect of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission by excluding other emissions from their simulation.
</p>
<p>The six 2-D models and three 3-D models are listed in <a href="048.htm#tab47">Table
  4-7</a>. The 3-D models obtain 3-D distributions of the species by solving 3-D
  mass continuity and chemistry equations. The 2-D models calculate the zonal-mean
  concentrations of the species by solving zonal-mean mass continuity equations.
  Transport of the zonal-mean concentration is affected by zonal-mean (vertical
  and horizontal) winds and eddy diffusion fluxes that simulate the effects of
  zonally asymmetric motions. Chemical packages are used to compute zonal-mean
  production and loss rates for each species. In this section, we highlight some
  of the differences in model formulations that may have contributed to differences
  in model predictions. The reader is referred to the Technical Report on Supersonic
  Aircraft Effects for additional details.2 </p>
<h4><i><a name="4311"></a>4.3.1.1. Domain and Resolution </i></h4>
<p>The lower boundary of the SLIMCAT model is at 335 K potential temperature (~
  10 km). All other models have lower boundary at the ground. The top boundary
  varies from 60-90 km. Vertical resolutions in the lower stratosphere range are
  1.2 (AER), 1.5 (LLNL, SCTM1), 2 (GSFC, CSIRO), and 3 km (UNIVAQ, LARC, THINAIR,
  and SLIMCAT). Horizontal resolutions for the 2-D models are 5∞ latitude for
  LLNL and CSIRO and 10∞ latitude for the rest. For the 3-D models, horizontal
  resolutions are 5.5∞x5.5∞ for LARC, 7.5∞x7.5∞ for SLIMCAT, and 10∞ longitude
  x 7.8∞ latitude for SCTM1. </p>

<p>All of the models use temperature lapse rates to define the location of the
  tropopause, which changes with season and latitude. Most 2-D models use temperature
  from climatology, whereas the 3-D models use temperature from GCM output or
  objectively analyzed temperatures that are based on measurements-for example
  from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) or European Centre
  for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The troposphere is distinguished
  from the stratosphere in the 2-D models by assigning large values of horizontal
  diffusion coefficient (Kyy typically 1-1.5x106 m<sup>2</sup>/sec) and vertical diffusion
  coefficient (Kzz ~4-10 m<sup>2</sup>/sec) to simulate rapid mixing. Studies indicate that
  stratosphere-troposphere exchange may be dominated by transport from the mid-
  and high-latitude lower stratosphere to the troposphere (Eluszkiewicz, 1996).
  In a 2-D model, this transport will manifest itself as eddy flux along isentropic
  surfaces across the tropopause boundary (Shia et al., 1993). If this premise
  is true, calculated residence time of aircraft emissions in the LS would be
  sensitive to the horizontal and vertical resolutions of the models because resolution
  constrains the location and seasonal variation of the tropopause. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4312"></a>4.3.1.2. Temperature, Transport Parameters, and Solvers</i></h4>
<p>The THINAIR model is the only model that calculates temperature and transport
  circulation consistent with calculated O<span class="subscript">3</span>. The rest of the models generated
  results in CTM mode; in other words, results are obtained using pre-calculated
  temperature and transport fields. Different methods are used to compute residual
  mean circulation and eddy diffusion coefficients. Transport circulation for
  the UNIVAQ 2-D model is taken from a low-resolution spectral GCM (Pitari et
  al., 1992). Winds and temperature for the LARC and SCTM1 models are from off-line
  GCM simulations, and those for SLIMCAT are from the UKMO analysis. There is
  no accepted method to validate computed transport parameters. Temperature is
  used to compute temperature-dependent reaction rate constants and, in some models,
  to predict the surface areas of PSCs. Different numerical schemes are used to
  solve the mass-continuity equations. Given the different methods used in deriving
  the transport parameters in the models, it is not surprising that there are
  large differences in calculated distributions of trace gases in the models.
  Large differences in model-simulated distributions of chemically inert tracers
  such as sulfur hexafluoride point to transport differences as a major contributor.
  The research community is trying to identify a climatological database for zonal-mean
  distributions of trace gases through an ongoing exercise (Models and Measurements
  II, Park et al., 1999) that can be used to diagnose transport parameters. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4313"></a>4.3.1.3. Chemistry </i></h4>
<p>Previous model intercomparison exercises have shown that chemistry solvers
  in most models calculate the same partitioning of radicals under the same constraints
  (solar zenith angle, overhead O<span class="subscript">3</span>, local temperature, local sulfate surface area,
  and local concentrations of the long-lived species) when they are used as box
  models in photochemical steady-state. Because the 2-D models transport zonal-mean
  concentrations, zonal-mean production and loss rates are needed in the mass-continuity
  equations for long-lived species. Different techniques are used to obtain zonal
  mean production and loss rates, including integrating diurnally varying concentrations
  of radicals obtained by explicit time marching to compute the zonal-mean rates
  or using diurnally averaged radical concentrations calculated from average solar
  zenith angles corrected by pre-calculated correction factors. </p>

<p>Reaction rate constants are from DeMore et al. (1997). There is no recommendation
  in DeMore et al. (1997) for the yield of hydrogen chloride (HCl) from the OH+ClO
  reaction. Lipson et al. (1997) recently measured a temperature-dependent yield
  of 5-6%. Most models assume that the HCl yield from the OH+ClO reaction to be
  0%. However, the CSIRO, LARC, and SLIMCAT models assume a 5% yield of HCl from
  OH+ClO. Because of the nonlinear dependence of reaction rate constants on temperature,
  the zonal average reaction rate constant calculated using local temperature
  as the air parcel moves around the globe zonally is different from the rate
  constant calculated using zonal-mean temperature. Some 2-D models chose to account
  for this effect by using a zonal temperature distribution based on observations;
  other models just used zonal mean temperature. </p>

<p>These reactions occur on the surface of particles (sulfate or PSC). In addition,
  all but two of the nine models (LLNL and UNIVAQ) include the reaction N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span> +
  HCl ' HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> + ClNO<span class="subscript">2</span> on PSC. In most cases, H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and HCl molecules are adsorbed
  or dissolved in the particles, and the reaction proceeds as the other reactant
  collides with the particle. There are slight variations in the temperature dependence
  of g for reactions on sulfate particles used in the various models. Previous
  analyses (Murphy and Ravishankara, 1994; Borrmann et al., 1997; Michelsen et
  al., 1999) have shown that g is very sensitive to temperature for some reactions.
  As the air parcel goes around the globe, it experiences temperatures that are
  both lower and higher than the zonal mean temperature. Ignoring zonal asymmetry
  in temperature by using zonal mean values in calculations may underestimate
  the O<span class="subscript">3</span> impact from HSCT (Pitari et al., 1993; Considine et al., 1994; Grooﬂ
  et al. 1994; Weisenstein et al., 1998). Because the sulfate surface area is
  specified in the calculations, the temperature-dependence comes from g and v.
  Some models compute an effective gv based on a temperature-weighted g and v
  from zonal-mean temperature, whereas other models compute a temperature-weighted
  product of gv. Some of the listed reactions also occur on type I PSCs (assumed
  to be nitric acid trihydrate (NAT)) or type II PSCs (assumed to be "ice"). Exact
  treatments in each model vary; see the Technical Report on Supersonic Aircraft
  Effects for details. </p>
<h3><i><b><a name="432"></a>4.3.2. Definition of Scenarios </b></i></h3>
<p>This section describes the scenarios for supersonic aircraft in 2015 and 2050
  that were evaluated for this assessment. The premise for the future supersonic
  (proposed hypothetical HSCT) aircraft fleet is given in <a href="130.htm">Chapter
  9</a>, along with descriptions of actual emissions databases. A subsonic fleet
  is included in all scenarios but is modified when an HSCT fleet is also present.
  The background atmosphere for the model scenarios was appropriate to either
  2015 or 2050, though parametric studies of reactive chlorine (Cl<span class="subscript">y</span>) concentration
  and background SAD were also performed. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4321"></a>4.3.2.1. Background Atmospheres </i></h4>
<p>Boundary conditions for the background atmosphere for long-lived gases for
  1992, 2015, and 2050 (<a href="049.htm#tab48">Table 4-8</a>) are based on the
  IPCC IS92a scenario (IPCC, 1992, 1995). The boundary conditions used for halocarbons
  correspond to (a) 3.7, 3.0, and 2.0 ppbv of Cl<span class="subscript">y</span> in the upper stratosphere at
  50 km at the Equator for 1992, 2015, and 2050, respectively; and (b) 15, 12.5,
  and 11.1 pptv of reactive bromine (Br<span class="subscript">y</span>) in the upper stratosphere at 50 km at
  the Equator for 1992, 2015, and 2050, respectively. </p>
<p>Background sulfate SAD was supplied for the unperturbed stratospheric aerosol
  case as described in Table 8-8 in WMO (1992). This case is designated SA0 aerosols.
  To approximate the effects of an active period of volcanic eruptions (e.g.,
  the past 2 decades), some scenarios also evaluate the effects of 4xSA0. Treatments
  of PSCs and associated chemical and dynamical processes differ among models.

  aircraft HSCT, which would cruise supersonically in the 17-20 km altitude range. 
  The NASA subsonic scenarios described in <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a> account 
  for displacement of subsonic air traffic by supersonic aircraft. Baseline computations 
  assume supersonic aircraft emissions with EI(H<span class="subscript">2</span>O)=1230 
  (1230 g H<span class="subscript">2</span>O kg<sup>-1</sup> fuel), EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5 
  (5 g NO<span class="subscript">2</span> kg<sup>-1</sup> fuel), and a range of 
  sulfate emission levels. Parametric studies were conducted around these baseline 
  HSCT scenarios by investigating NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission 
  index, fleet size, flight altitude, and background atmospheric conditions. These 
  parametric studies are appropriate because the technology of a commercially 
  viable supersonic airplane is not yet well-defined and results are needed to 
  determine the sensitivity of the O<span class="subscript">3</span> impact to 
  the technology level. A description of each of the scenarios evaluated by the 
  participating models is given in Tables <a href="047.htm#tab44">4-4</a>, <a href="049.htm#tab49">4-9</a>, 
  <a href="049.htm#tab410">4-10</a>, <a href="049.htm#tab411">4-11</a>, and <a href="049.htm#tab412">4-12</a>. 
  The HSCT scenarios use a number and letter designation preceded by the letter 
  S (e.g., the first scenario is S1a). HSCT scenarios contain subsonic aircraft 
  as well as HSCT commercial aircraft, with the combination accounting for the 
  same passenger demand as in subsonic-only scenarios for 2015 and 2050. The HSCT 
  scenarios in Tables <a href="049.htm#tab411">4-11</a> and <a href="049.htm#tab412">4-12</a> 
  are generally analyzed relative to the corresponding 2015 and 2050 base plus 
  subsonic scenarios. </p>
<p>The effects of sulfur, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, CO, and NMHC (as CH<span class="subscript">4</span>) are simulated in the
  scenarios. The treatment of sulfur emission is discussed later in this section.
  For the other species, the aircraft effluents are put into the model as follows:
  Gridded fuel burn data (kg fuel/day) are first mapped into the model grid; the
  amount of material emitted into each grid box is given by the product of the
  fuel burn and the EI; and the emitted material is put into the grid box at each
  time step with the equivalent rate. </p>
<p>In this approach, we ignore the effect of plume processing and assume that
  these emitted materials are instantaneously mixed into the grid box. This assumption
  is probably valid in most of the stratosphere, though it may not be valid in
  the cold polar lower stratosphere during winter. In these regions, chemical
  processes are strongly nonlinear, thus raising concerns about the assumption.
  To date there have been no detailed wake model calculations supporting or rejecting
  this assumption. This important caveat should be remembered when considering
  the model results presented in this section. </p>

<p>The effect of sulfur emission on SAD depends on how much SO<span class="subscript">2</span> is converted to
  small particles in the aircraft plume. Conversion of SO<span class="subscript">2</span> to aerosol particles
  within the aircraft plume was found to perturb stratospheric SAD to a much greater
  extent than equivalent SO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions (Weisenstein et al., 1996, 1998). Atmospheric
  measurements in the plume of the Concorde (Fahey et al., 1995) and other aircraft,
  along with modeling studies (Danilin et al., 1997; K‰rcher and Fahey, 1997;
  Yu and Turco, 1998), suggest a minimum 10% conversion, with much larger conversion
  rates possible. However, near-field particle observations (as discussed in Chapters
  <a href="031.htm">3</a> and <a href="088.htm">7</a>) suggest a typical conversion
  of sulfur to sulfuric acid (H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>) of less than 10% with a large, yet not fully
  understood variability under the assumption that the aerosol composition is
  H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>/H<span class="subscript">2</span>O. Model sensitivity studies were designed to examine the full range
  of this uncertainty with conversion fractions of 0, 10, 50, and 100%. </p>
<p>In most scenarios, the reference atmosphere is consistent with a SAD using
  SA0. If the HSCT scenario assumes no sulfur emissions, SA0 is used for the HSCT
  case as well. In some HSCT calculations, the effect of increased SAD from SO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  emissions by aircraft is also considered, using a range of different sulfate
  conversion fractions (Tables <a href="049.htm#tab49">4-9</a> through <a href="049.htm#tab412">4-12</a>).
  The additional SAD fields were constructed by calculating sulfate surface area
  for background and HSCT conditions using the AER microphysical model coupled
  to their 2-D CTM (Weisenstein et al., 1997). The SAD perturbation (HSCT-background)
  was derived in absolute units and was added to the SA0 background SAD distribution.
  The SA5 case assumes a 10% conversion rate for 500 HSCTs with an EI(SO<span class="subscript">2</span>) of
  0.4. This case also roughly approximates a 5% conversion rate, for an EI(SO<span class="subscript">2</span>)=0.8,
  with the sulfur content of the fuel maintaining its current value. <a href="041.htm#img325">Figure
  3-25</a> shows the annually zonally averaged perturbation of SAD (in µm<sup>2</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>)
  used in the SA5 scenario. SA6 is similar to SA5 but is based on 1,000 HSCTs.
  A 0% conversion with EI(SO<span class="subscript">2</span>)=0.4 is considered in SA7 for an aircraft fleet
  of 500 planes. The assumption of 50% conversion with EI(SO<span class="subscript">2</span>)=0.4 is considered
  here in SA1 and SA2 for aircraft fleets of 500 and 1,000 planes, respectively.
  The assumption of 100% conversion with EI(SO<span class="subscript">2</span>)=0.4 is considered in SA3 and
  SA4 as an upper limit. SA3 assumes 500 aircraft, whereas SA4 assumes 1,000 aircraft.
  SAD was also computed for fleets flying 2 km lower. A summary of all SAD distributions
  used in these scenarios is given in <a href="049.htm#tab49">Table 4-9</a>. </p>
