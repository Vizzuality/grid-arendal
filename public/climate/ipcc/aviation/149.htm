<!-- #BeginEditable "Page_Content_Here" --> <h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>. Although improvements in aircraft engine technology and air traffic management
  technology will bring environmental benefits, these benefits are not expected
  to be sufficient to fully offset the projected growth of aviation emissions
  arising from increased demand for air transportation services (as discussed
  in the scenarios in <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a>). These scenarios adopt simplifying assumptions
  of full implementation of communication, navigation, and surveillance/air traffic
  management (CNS/ATM) and no infrastructure constraints. As a result, they are
  thought to show unrealistically high projected growth of air traffic and emissions.
  Policy measures aimed at addressing the growth of aviation emissions will need
  to take this factor into account. </p>
<p>. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is the United Nations
  (UN) specialized agency that has global responsibility for the establishment
  of standards, recommended practices, and guidance on various aspects of international
  civil aviation, including the environment. The Kyoto Protocol committed countries
  to work through ICAO in limiting or reducing emissions of greenhouse gases from
  aviation bunker fuels, but international aviation emissions are not covered
  by emissions reduction targets in the Kyoto Protocol. </p>
<p>. Policy measures have the potential to limit the growth of aircraft emissions
  by encouraging technological innovation, effecting greater operating efficiencies
  in the aviation industry, and affecting demand. Such measures include initiatives
  to ensure timely implementation of CNS/ATM; development of regulatory standards
  for aircraft emissions, operational measures, and avoidance of delay; and market-based
  instruments such as environmental levies and emissions trading. Voluntary and
  mandated policies to reduce emissions internalize to the producer or consumer
  many of the associated environmental costs. </p>
<p>. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) has been used as a tool to conduct economic analysis
  of environmental mitigation measures across many areas of economic activity,
  but some difficulties have arisen in its application to aviation, primarily
  because of measurement and information problems. CBA provides a framework for
  balancing economic and environmental impacts associated with different policy
  options. The precautionary and "polluter pays" principles set out in the 1992
  Rio Declaration are also relevant to economic analysis of policies aimed at
  limiting the growth of aviation emissions. </p>
<p>. In 1981, ICAO established aircraft engine emission standards for oxides of
  nitrogen (NO<span class="subscript">x</span>). Since then, the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> standard has been made more stringent (by
  20% in 1993). A further 16% change to newly certified engines after 2003 was
  recommended in 1998. ICAO has established an approach that requires that any
  actions to mitigate the environmental effects of aviation show environmental
  need, technical feasibility, and economic reasonableness. The current method
  of regulating NO<span class="subscript">x</span> based on the landing/take-off (LTO) cycle does not fully address
  emissions at altitude. ICAO is developing a new parameter for emissions certification
  during climb and at cruise altitude to complement the existing LTO cycle-based
  parameter. </p>
<p>. Timely implementation of CNS/ATM is important to success in leading to reduced
  fuel burn and emissions; CNS/ATM is critically dependent on the development
  of necessary institutional and financial arrangements. </p>
<p>. Existing studies indicate that levies on fuel and en route charges are viewed
  as the most environmentally effective levies. If passed through to consumers,
  environmental levies could reduce consumption of aviation fuel, hence aircraft
  emissions, by providing incentives to develop and use more energy-efficient
  aircraft, by optimizing operations, and by reducing the growth in demand for
  air transport. However, a practical difficulty is that most bilateral air service
  agreements exempt fuel used internationally from tax. Levies at a regional level
  may avoid this and other problems. There is concern, however, that this approach
  would not have sufficient environmental impact, in some cases could increase
  other emissions, and could lead to economic distortions. </p>
<p>. Emissions trading is a market-based approach that enables participants from
  all industries to cooperatively minimize the costs of reducing emissions. The
  role of governments would be to set a cap on emissions and rules for trading
  reductions under such a cap. Initial experience at the national and international
  levels in other industries suggests that emissions trading can provide an effective
  incentive for firms to innovate and achieve low-cost emissions reduction. </p>
<p>. Other potential mitigation measures are voluntary agreements to meet environmental
  targets and funding of research to better understand the environmental impact
  of aircraft emissions. </p>
<p>. There are uncertainties over future trends in traffic and emissions and the
  impact of mitigation measures.</p>
