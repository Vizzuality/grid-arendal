<h4>7.4.1.2. Propulsive and Overall Efficiency</h4>
<p>The power produced by engine thrust is the product of thrust and flight velocity
  (V). The ratio of this useful power to the increment in kinetic energy given
  to the flow in passing through the engine is the propulsive efficiency 
  (h<SPAN class="subscript">p</span>); a good approximation of this variable may 
  written in the form h<SPAN class="subscript">p</span> = 
  2V/(V + V<SPAN class="subscript">j</span>), where V<SPAN class="subscript">j</span> 
  is the jet velocity.</p>
<p>High levels of thermal efficiency require the 
  T<SPAN class="subscript">4</span>/T<SPAN class="subscript">2</span> ratio to be as 
  high as possible with appropriate pressure ratio and component efficiencies. In the
  case of a simple turbojet gas turbine engine, this requirement would mean that
  the jet velocities are also relatively high. For example, for a ratio of 
  T<SPAN class="subscript">4</span>/T<SPAN class="subscript">2</span> = 5.6 together 
  with an engine pressure ratio of 40, the jet velocity V<SPAN class="subscript">j</span> 
  would be about 817 ms<sup>-1</sup>, (Cumpsty, 1997). At Mach 0.85 at 10.7 km, when 
  the flight velocity V is 252 ms<sup>-1</sup>, the relationship shown above gives a 
  propulsive efficiency of only about 47%. Thermal efficiency at this condition is 
  about 48%, so h<SPAN class="subscript">o</span>= h<SPAN class="subscript">p</span> 
  x h<SPAN class="subscript">therm</span> = 0.48 x 0.47 = 23% for the assumptions of 
  this simplified example. For typical aircraft, overall efficiency ranges between 
  20 and 40%.</p>
<p>The most practical method of raising overall efficiency is to lower the jet
  velocity and thereby increase propulsive efficiency; this approach has been
  adopted in the bypass engine used so widely today. In this engine design, hot
  gases leaving the core turbine expand through further turbine stages, which
  drive the fan mounted in front of the core compressor. In most modern engines,
  the pressure ratio across the fan at cruise condition is about 1.6, giving a
  bypass ratio of about 6 and a jet velocity of about 400 ms<sup>-1</sup>. At this jet velocity,
  propulsive efficiency is about 77% at a cruise speed of Mach 0.85 at 10.7 km.
  Unfortunately, losses associated with the inefficiency of the fan and the turbine
  driving it inevitably reduce these benefits somewhat, so a typical value for
  the overall efficiency of such an engine is currently about 30 to 37% at cruise.
  Increasing the bypass ratio clearly offers the prospect of further increases
  in propulsive efficiency, but this approach has to be weighed against the penalties
  of increased size and weight of the installed engine and associated changes
  in drag (see <a href="091.htm">Section 7.2</a> for further discussion of airframe
  efficiency and installation effects). Other prospects for increasing propulsive
  efficiency (e.g., propellers and unducted fans) are discussed in <a href="098.htm">Section
  7.4.3</a>. </p>

<p>This brief review of theoretical considerations summarizes thermodynamic and
  aerodynamic constraints for engine designers in the continuing drive toward
  more efficient engines for current and future requirements. Although today's
  most advanced engines have bypass ratios in the range 5 to 9, there will be
  efforts to continue to try to increase them. Despite their attractions, however,
  bypass ratios much in excess of 9 are likely to require a gear box between the
  power turbine and the fan, or a novel configuration (a topic taken up further
  in <a href="098.htm">Section 7.4.3</a>), as well as imposing installation and
  weight problems. </p>

<h3>7.4.2. Historical Trends<a name="742"></a></h3>
<p>The foregoing discussion briefly reviewed the ways in which basic engine cycle
  considerations can influence design trends of gas turbines. Practical confirmation
  of such trends may be obtained by looking at historical trends of principal
  parameters affecting the performance of gas turbines since they were first introduced.
  Economic and aircraft range considerations have been uppermost in engine designers'
  minds. <a href="096.htm#img79">Figure 7-9</a> clearly shows the impressive progress
  made in reducing thrust-specific fuel consumption (mass flow rate of fuel burned
  per unit of thrust) with time. The engines of 1960 to 1970 vintage were either
  turbojets or first-generation low bypass ratio turbofans (<a href="094.htm#img77">Figure
  7-7</a>) with relatively high levels of fuel consumption. The period from 1970
  to the mid-1980s saw the introduction of second-generation turbofan engines,
  which are generally referred to as high bypass ratio engines, which had significantly
  better fuel consumption than the earlier engines. Improvements in fuel consumption
  for third generation engines were smaller. </p>
<p>Important improvements in the understanding of complex aerodynamic flows within
  turbomachinery have been achieved over the past 25 years through mathematical
  modeling and parallel advances in experimental techniques. <a href="096.htm#img710">Figure
  7-10</a> provides clear evidence of the benefits of that work in the rising
  trend of overall pressure ratio with time. In line with the fundamental relationships
  presented in <a href="095.htm#741">Section 7.4.1</a>, this trend has contributed
  significantly to the reduced fuel consumption shown in <a href="096.htm#img79">Figure
  7-9</a>. </p>
<p>Parallel work in the fields of combustion technology and materials have contributed
  to increasing levels of peak cycle temperatures-as shown in <a href="097.htm#img711">Figure
  7-11</a>, in which the trend of combustor exit temperature is plotted against
  the same time scale. (Note that this is the maximum temperature, which occurs
  at take-off. Temperatures are generally lower at cruise.) This increasing temperature
  trend has contributed not only to the improved fuel consumption trend shown
  in <a href="096.htm#img79">Figure 7-9</a>-by virtue of improved thermal efficiency-but
  also to the rise in thrust-to-weight ratio, leading to higher payload for the
  same overall aircraft weight. The impact of increasing temperatures on various
  pollutant emissions is described in <a href="099.htm">Section 7.5</a>. </p>
