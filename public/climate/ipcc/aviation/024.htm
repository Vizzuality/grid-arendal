<h3><b>2.1.3. Effects of Aircraft Aerosol Emissions</b></h3>
<p>There is strong laboratory and observational evidence for the importance of
  aerosols in atmospheric photochemical processes such as lower stratospheric
  ozone depletion (WMO-UNEP, 1995), tropospheric SO<span class="subscript">2</span> oxidation (Calvert et al.,
  1985), and tropospheric soluble trace gas removal. A large number of additional
  chemical processes involving aerosols has been postulated; however, a lack of
  information on the abundance, nature, and reactivity of the various aerosol
  types (e.g., dust, soot, sulfate, nitrate, organic) has hindered an accurate
  assessment. In this section, we summarize the connections between aerosol processes
  and ozone chemistry in the UT and LS. In addition, we assess the nature of aircraft-derived
  aerosol impacts on ozone abundances at aircraft cruising altitudes. </p>
<h4><i><a name="2131"></a>2.1.3.1. Aerosols and Tropospheric Ozone Chemistry</i></h4>
<p>Reactions occurring on the surface of solid and liquid aerosols (i.e., heterogeneous
  reactions) or inside aqueous aerosols (i.e., homogeneous bulk reactions) can
  lead to a decrease in the production of ozone (reactions 1-5) by catalyzing
  the removal of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and HO<span class="subscript">x</span>. Generally, heterogeneous reactions counteract reactions
  involving free radical species. From the ozone production perspective, removal
  of active species can occur by irreversible deposition of HO<span class="subscript">x</span>, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, or NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and
  HO<span class="subscript">x</span> source species or by conversion of more reactive nitrogen- and hydrogen-containing
  species into less reactive ones. Conversion of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span> into HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> on sulfate or
  ice particles is the best established example of the latter mechanism. Wet deposition
  of HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>, hydrogen peroxide (H<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">2</span>), and other soluble acids is an example of
  the former mechanism. Because removal of active species can also occur by gas-phase
  mechanisms, the importance of this aerosol chemistry depends on the relative
  rates of the gas and aerosol processes. The rates of heterogeneous processes
  depend on the available aerosol surface area as well as on their size distribution.
  As summarized in <a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a>, typical mid-latitude upper tropospheric soot and
  sulfate aerosol surface areas are 10 �m<sup>2</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> (see also Pueschel et al., 1997).
  Much larger water-ice surface areas, on the order of 104 �m<sup>2</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, are found
  inside young contrails (Petzold et al., 1997) and natural cirrus clouds (Dowling
  and Radke, 1990). </p>
<p>Aircraft impact studies have motivated laboratory investigations of heterogeneous
  soot reactions. Interest in reactions occurring on soot has also increased in
  response to suggestions, based on analysis of field observations (Hauglustaine
  et al., 1996; Jacob et al., 1996; Lary et al., 1997), that aerosol-assisted
  conversion of HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> to NO<span class="subscript">x</span> may occur under some unknown conditions. Processes
  like the HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>-to-NO<span class="subscript">2</span> conversion, which result in a reduction of the oxidation
  state of an atmospheric species, are of particular interest because they proceed
  counter to the overall tendency of the troposphere to act as an oxidizing medium.
  For the specific HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> example, the reduction mechanism operates at the expense
  of the oxidation of the soot substrate and would promote production of ozone
  by increasing levels of active NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. </p>
<p>Some of the most important heterogeneous reactions on soot involving NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and
  its reservoirs, which are of likely importance in the UT and have been studied
  in the laboratory, are presented below. In view of the fact that the number
  concentration of nonvolatile particles-the majority of which are presumed to
  be soot-in a young contrail is on the order of 104 particles cm<sup>-3</sup> (Brasseur
  et al., 1998), we start our discussion with heterogeneous oxidation-reduction
  reactions that may occur on soot. Heterogeneous kinetic studies involving "soot"
  have been performed on a variety of substrates, encompassing materials as diverse
  as commercially available amorphous carbon, carbonaceous material ("active carbon"
  or "carbon black"), and soot from hydrocarbon diffusion flames that use fuels
  such as hexane, toluene, ethylene, and acetylene. Therefore, comparisons of
  results obtained on different substrates should be made with caution. The heterogeneous
  reaction of NO<span class="subscript">2</span> with soot may be represented by the following reactions (Tabor
  et al., 1993, 1994; Rogaski et al., 1997; Gerecke et al., 1998): </p>

<p> where [soot.O] and [soot.OH] represent surface sites on soot that have been
  oxidized, hence deactivated by the heterogeneous reaction. It is not clear yet
  if soot participates as a reducing agent (reaction 19c) or simply as a reservoir
  of hydrogen (H(ads), reaction 19d) in its reaction with NO<span class="subscript">2</span> to yield HONO. </p>
<p>Reactions 19a and 19c correspond to a reduction-oxidation reaction in which
  soot is the reducing agent. Soot is oxidized in the process and releases CO
  and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> upon heating, although the primary oxidation product [soot.O] has not
  been characterized on a molecular level. It is thought that the surface of soot
  will be modified in the oxidation process, resulting in the accumulation of
  multiple functional groups bearing oxygen (Chughtai et al., 1990). </p>
<p>The branching ratio between reactions 19a and 19c or 19d depends on the soot
  sampling location as well as the fuel used to produce the soot, albeit to a
  minor extent. In general, amorphous carbon does not generate HONO, whereas soot
  sampled early in its formation process may give rise to a HONO yield of up to
  90% compared to the NO<span class="subscript">2</span> taken up (Gerecke et al., 1998). Measurements within
  exhaust plumes have established the presence of nitrous acid (HNO<span class="subscript">2</span>) and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>
  at concentrations well above background (Arnold et al., 1992, 1994). The data
  indicate that about 0.6% of the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is converted to HNO<span class="subscript">2</span> and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>. More recent
  data on exhaust plumes of five B-747s and one DC-10 increase this efficiency
  to 1-5% of the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> (Brasseur et al., 1998). Therefore, care must be exercised
  when HONO concentrations measured in the plume are used to infer OH concentrations
  or emission indices for OH using known reaction parameters for OH + NO (Tremmel
  et al., 1998). </p>
<p>Another pair of heterogeneous reactions occurring on soot have been shown to
  be of importance in the troposphere (Brouwer et al., 1986): <br>

<p>Reaction 20a is a hydrolysis reaction for which soot is the support material,
  whereas reaction 20b corresponds to a reduction-oxidation reaction in which
  soot is the reducing agent. The primary oxidation product [soot.O] of reaction
  20b has not been identified, but it releases CO and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> upon heating (reaction
  19b), similar to the oxidation of soot by NO<span class="subscript">2</span> in reaction 19a. The heterogeneous
  reaction of the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reservoir HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> on soot also corresponds to a reduction-oxidation
  reaction analogous to the examples listed above (Rogaski et al., 1997):

<p>Finally, ozone reacts heterogeneously with soot in a redox reaction in which
  soot is the reducing agent (Stephens et al., 1986; Fendel et al., 1995; Rogaski
  et al., 1997): </p>

</table>
<p>It is important to note that reaction 22 does not correspond to a catalytic
  reaction because for every ozone molecule reacted, CO and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> are formed according
  to reaction 19b. Therefore, soot is consumed as shown in the mass balance involving
  carbon (Stephens et al., 1986). Thus, in all of the above reactions-with the
  possible exception of reaction 19d-soot appears to act as a reducing agent that
  is consumed in the course of the reduction-oxidation reaction. </p>
<p>Heterogeneous reactions of other potentially important reservoir and active
  compounds on soot are virtually unexplored. Examples may include reactions of
  HNO<span class="subscript">4</span>, H<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">2</span>, HO<span class="subscript">x</span>, XNO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and XONO<span class="subscript">2</span>, with X=Cl, Br. HNO<span class="subscript">2</span> does not, however, seem
  to undergo heterogeneous interaction on soot to any significant extent (Gerecke
  et al., 1998). </p>
<p>Ice as a substrate in heterogeneous reactions has not received as much attention
  in laboratory studies as reactions occurring on other stratospherically relevant
  substrates such as supercooled and frozen sulfuric acid (H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>) hydrates, as
  well as type Ia and Ib polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) substrates. N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span> undergoes
  a reactive uptake on tropospherically important substrates such as H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>/H<span class="subscript">2</span>O
  (Hanson and Ravishankara, 1991; Fried et al., 1994) and water ice (Quinlan et
  al., 1990; Hanson and Ravishankara, 1992), which results in HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> formation.
  HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> undergoes non-reactive uptake only on the aforementioned substrates (i.e.,
  condensation) (Hanson, 1992; IUPAC, 1997a; JPL, 1997). N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span> also undergoes a
  bimolecular reaction with hydrogen chloride (HCl) on ice, resulting in ClNO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  in competition with the well-documented hydrolysis reaction leading to HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>
  (IUPAC, 1997a; JPL, 1997; Seisel et al., 1998): </p>

<p>Reaction 23 occurs faster on ice than on H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> because of limitations of HCl
  solubility in H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>. The increase in the rate of heterogeneous reactions on
  ice compared to acidic surfaces generally occurs for all reactions involving
  hydrohalic acids (IUPAC, 1997a; JPL, 1997). Reaction 23 competes with heterogeneous
  hydrolysis of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span>, similar to reaction 20a. At temperatures near 200 K and
  at the limit of high HCl concentrations, 65% of the reaction proceeds via ClNO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  formation; the rest proceeds through N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span> hydrolysis.<br>
  NO, NO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and ozone do not interact with H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> at concentrations encountered
  in the UT, or with water ice. Similarly, HONO does not interact with water ice
  down to temperatures of 180 K (Fenter and Rossi, 1996). However, HONO is taken
  up by H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>/H<span class="subscript">2</span>O binary mixtures (weight of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> > 65%) from ambient temperatures
  down to 180 K and eventually yields nitrosylsulfuric acid (NSA) after protonation
  (Becker et al., 1996; Fenter and Rossi, 1996; Zhang et al., 1996; Kleffmann

<p>An important finding regarding halogen activation by reactions 24 and 25 is
  the fact that these reactions occur approximately 20 times faster on pure ice,
  bypassing NSA as an intermediate species altogether because of its instability
  on ice (Fenter and Rossi, 1996). The propensity of many bimolecular heterogeneous
  reactions to occur more efficiently on ice surfaces compared to sulfuric acid
  aerosols is considered particularly relevant with regard to chemical processes
  occurring on natural cirrus clouds in the UT and on those seeded by particles
  emitted from aircraft engines, owing to a change in the reaction mechanism.
  The relevant water-ice mechanism corresponds to a simple ionic displacement
  of the form </p>

<p> where NOCl may undergo photolysis to Cl and NO. Although reactions 24-26 may
  not be important under volcanically quiescent periods (Longfellow et al., 1998),
  they may nevertheless play an important role in young contrails and perhaps
  in aged plumes, in view of the large number concentrations of volatile particles
  whose densities may be on the order of a few 104 particles cm<sup>-3</sup> (Brasseur et
  al., 1998). </p>
<p>The chemical transformation of NO to N<span class="subscript">2</span>O on acidic surfaces is too slow to
  be of significance in the present context (Wiesen et al., 1994). However, an
  efficient heterogeneous reaction involving NO and SO<span class="subscript">2</span> on solid and liquid aerosols
  could lead to the formation of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O within the plume on a time scale of tens
  of minutes (Pires et al., 1996). In this chemistry, the interaction of HONO
  and SO<span class="subscript">2</span> on humid surfaces, solid or liquid, may lead to N<span class="subscript">2</span>O, which also has
  been observed as a result of other laboratory experiments on heterogeneous chemistry
  of NO<span class="subscript">2</span>-soot interactions (Smith et al., 1988). </p>
<p>Many of the other potentially important reservoir species-such as HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>, HNO<span class="subscript">4</span>,
  and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">2</span>-absorb onto sulfuric acid aerosols and ice particles but do not react
  with them (IUPAC, 1997a; JPL, 1997). These heterogeneous interactions are central
  to the removal of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and HO<span class="subscript">x</span> species during denitrification and sedimentation
  events in the UT and LS.</p>
<p>  
  The particle dimension of cirrus cloud crystals is on the order of 10 to 15
  �m, which is approximately 10 times larger than PSC type IIs and 50 to 100 times
  larger than PSC type Is (Petzold and Schr�der, 1998). This result, together
  with the fact that the pressure is higher in the UT than in the LS, necessitates
  a downward correction for heterogeneous rates in cases in which the uptake coefficient
  (g) is larger than 5x10<sup>2</sup> because molecular diffusion of the gas toward the surface
  of the particle becomes rate limiting. This correction may be especially important
  for the case of a heterogeneous reaction on ice with an uptake coefficient exceeding
  0.1 and may thus increase the uncertainty when extrapolating laboratory rate
  parameters to atmospheric concentrations. At present, most published models
  assume that the interfacial reaction is rate limiting and prescribe a rate constant
  of the form k=g<c>A/4, where g is the uptake coefficient, <c> is the average
  molecular velocity, and A is the surface area of the atmospheric particle per
  unit volume. </p>
<h4><i><a name="2132"></a>2.1.3.2. Aerosols and Stratospheric Ozone Chemistry</i></h4>
<p> It is now well-established that aerosols-consisting mainly of water, sulfate,
  and nitrate-play a crucial role in defining lower stratospheric levels of active
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and ClO<span class="subscript">x</span> (WMO-UNEP, 1995). Heterogeneous reactions in the stratosphere convert
  the inactive species HCl and chlorine nitrate (ClONO<span class="subscript">2</span>) into the photolytically
  labile Cl2 species and the more active N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span> species into the less active HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>
  species. The net effect of these processes is to decrease NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels and increase
  stratospheric levels of ClO<span class="subscript">x</span> and HO<span class="subscript">x</span>, hence the importance of ClO<span class="subscript">x</span>- and HO<span class="subscript">x</span>-catalyzed
  ozone loss relative to NO<span class="subscript">x</span>-catalyzed ozone loss (refer to <a href="023.htm#img22">Figure
  2-2</a>). Increases in the total surface area of lower stratospheric aerosol
  by additional aerosol sources such as aircraft further accentuate the importance
  of ClO<span class="subscript">x</span>- and HO<span class="subscript">x</span>-catalyzed chemistry and reduce the impact of aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  on ozone depletion. The net effect on ozone depletion will depend on the magnitude
  of the aerosol perturbation relative to the natural background and on given
  background levels of ClO<span class="subscript">x</span> and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> radicals, as well as on possible changes in
  the frequency of denitrification events induced by aircraft aerosols, water
  vapor, and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>. Aircraft-induced aerosols will be imbedded in a highly variable
  natural stratospheric aerosol background. In particular, stratospheric sulfate
  surface areas-typically on the order of 1 �m<sup>2</sup> in volcanically quiescent periods-are
  nearly an order of magnitude larger than corresponding soot surface areas. During
  PSC type II events, surface areas of water-ice can approach 10 �m<sup>2</sup>. Likewise,
  amplification of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> aerosol surface area can be up to a factor of 100 following
  volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p> A number of heterogeneous reactions are important to various degrees on the
  surfaces of ice particles (PSC type II), HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>/H<span class="subscript">2</span>O aerosols (PSC type Ia), and
  saturated ternary solutions of water, HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>, and H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> (PSC type Ib). Rate parameters
  for heterogeneous reactions depend complexly on temperature, pressure, and humidity
  conditions. Consequently, modeling of stratospheric reactions must explicitly
  address differences in conditions between poles and mid-latitudes and between
  the tropopause and the LS. The most important heterogeneous reaction in relation
  to ozone depletion on a global scale is the heterogeneous hydrolysis of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span>
  (reaction 20) (Hofmann and Solomon, 1989; Solomon et al., 1996; Kotamarthi et
  al., 1997). This and the following reactions are likely to be enhanced in the
  presence of increased atmospheric particulates such as contrails and aircraft-induced
  cirrus clouds, which correspond to PSC type II in the LS from a chemical point
  of view. </p>
<p>Chlorine and bromine activation on PSC type Ia and Ib as well as on PSC type
  II (ice) takes place according to the following reactions: <br>

<p> Reactions of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span> with HCl(s) and HONO with HCl(s) (reactions 23 and 26) are
  also possible (IUPAC, 1997a; JPL, 1997). Because of the strong decrease in the
  solubility of HCl with increasing acidity of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> solutions-thus with increasing
  stratospheric temperature-reactions 28, 29, 31, and 32 will be most important
  at high latitudes (Portmann et al., 1996). Accordingly, these bimolecular reactions
  will proceed fastest on type II PSC surfaces in the polar vortex or on cirrus
  cloud particles in the tropopause region (Borrmann et al., 1996; Solomon et
  al., 1997). In addition, the hydrolysis reaction of ClONO<span class="subscript">2</span> (reaction 27) is
  less efficient than the corresponding one involving BrONO<span class="subscript">2</span> (reaction 30), on
  account of thermochemical differences between the reactions (Allanic et al.,
  1997; Barone et al., 1997; Oppliger et al., 1997). One consequence of this difference
  is that reaction 27 is prone to surface saturation on solid substrates, whereas
  reaction 30 is a strong and continuous source of HOBr, thereby making BrONO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  a relatively labile reservoir compound. </p>
<h4><i><a name="2133"></a>2.1.3.3. Aircraft Aerosols and Heterogeneous Reactivity
  </i></h4>
<p>Heterogeneous reactions are important in defining ozone removal rates in the
  stratosphere and troposphere. Stratospheric and tropospheric aerosol particles
  differ markedly in composition, lifetime, and size distribution. In the stratosphere,
  the global background aerosol consists predominantly of sulfate; water-ice and
  carbonaceous particles are minor components on the global scale, although PSCs
  that contain water-ice can be important on smaller geographic scales. Tropospheric
  aerosols consist of a wide variety of constituents, including water, sulfuric
  acid, soot, mineral dust, sea salt, and organic particles. </p>
<p>Soot, sulfuric acid ("sulfate"), and water-ice particles are the main condensed-phase
  species found in the exhaust of jet aircraft. As mentioned above, all of these
  species are present in the background atmosphere, and all derive from natural
  and other non-aircraft anthropogenic sources. Consequently, the effect of aircraft
  aerosol emissions on atmospheric photochemistry, to a first approximation, is
  to increase the soot, sulfate, and water-ice surface areas available for heterogenous
  and multiphase processes discussed in the previous subsections. Large-scale
  aerosol loading from aircraft can be estimated roughly from knowledge of fleet
  emission rates and average residence time of particles deposited at given altitudes.
  A detailed discussion of aircraft particle loading appears in <a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a>. For
  the purposes of this chapter, it suffices to note that aircraft soot and sulfur
  emissions are thought to be significant at cruise altitudes, whereas estimates
  of the perturbation from aircraft H<span class="subscript">2</span>O remain highly uncertain. </p>
<p>Beyond the simple aircraft aerosol loading approximation, chemistry occurring
  inside aircraft plumes carries the potential to produce volatile aerosols of
  significantly different heterogeneous reactivity relative to typical background
  aerosols. For instance, the water content of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> particles will vary over
  a wide range in an aircraft plume and wake, with concomitant effects on the
  rates of reactions 27-32. In addition, under cold lower stratospheric conditions,
  aircraft plume production of HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>-rich liquid aerosol may propogate to the larger
  scale and contribute to the formation of solid PSCs, hence enhance processing
  of inactive chlorine species (K�rcher, 1997). Finally, evidence is mounting
  that volatile aerosols formed under conditions of low fuel sulfur content may
  contain significant amounts of light fuel-bound organic constituents (K�rcher
  et al., 1998b). The heterogeneous reactivity of such organic-containing aerosols
  is unknown and must await further in situ aerosol characterization. </p>
<p>Significant differences may also exist between aircraft-derived and ambient
  background soot particles. As discussed in <a href="024.htm#2131">Section 2.1.3.1</a>,
  soot surfaces may act as reaction catalysts or consumables, depending on their
  properties. In addition, the surface properties likely determine the extent
  to which reduction-oxidation reactions occur on a particular soot particle.
  At present there is virtually no information on the properties of aircraft-derived
  or ambient background carbonaceous particles upon which to base an evaluation.
</p>
<h4><i><a name="2134"></a>2.1.3.4. Net Effects on Ozone</i></h4>
<p>Based on our current understanding of heterogeneous chemistry, aircraft sulfate
  and water-ice particles will lower ozone concentrations in the UT and LS relative
  to what they would be if aircraft emissions contained only NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. This process
  occurs because the particles remove the ozone precursors HO<span class="subscript">x</span> and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the
  UT and liberate ozone-destroying ClO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the LS. The heterogeneous chemistry
  occurring on soot is much less well understood, so its role in atmospheric chemistry
  is much harder to define. However, because particle abundances of sulfate in
  the LS are much greater than those of soot, we can conclude with some confidence
  that present aircraft soot emissions are having little impact on stratospheric
  ozone, provided that their primary impact is on partitioning between NOy and
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. </p>
<p>The extent to which aircraft aerosols offset the effects of aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  on atmospheric ozone depends on a variety of chemical and dynamical factors.
  To quantify this balance, we will need atmospheric models that combine representations
  of aerosol microphysics, gas and heterogeneous chemistry, and atmospheric dynamics.
