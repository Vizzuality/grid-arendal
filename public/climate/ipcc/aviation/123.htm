<h3>8.2.4. Implementation </h3>
<h4><a name="8241"></a>8.2.4.1. Emerging Concepts </h4>
<p>To attain the benefits of an improved ATM system, the United States and Europe
  have designed future ATM concepts as a logical progression of ICAO's work on
  CNS/ATM systems. The improvements described in <a href="122.htm">Section 8.2.3</a>
  are expected to be implemented over the next 20 years. For a discussion of institutional
  and financial arrangements related to the implementation of CNS/ATM systems,
  see <a href="148.htm">Chapter 10</a>. </p>
<p>The U.S. effort, known as Free Flight, would enable optimum and dynamically
  determined flight paths for all airspace users through CNS/ATM technologies
  and the establishment of ATM procedures that maximize flexibility while ensuring
  positive separation of aircraft (RTCA, 1995). The European Organisation for
  Safety and Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) has defined the future uniform European
  ATM System (EATMS) and an associated ATM Strategy for 2000+ as a system whereby
  flights will be managed from a total system perspective from gate to gate (EUROCONTROL,
  1998b). This approach is expected to reduce fragmentation and improve efficiency
  considerably. The ATM 2000+ strategy and EATMS are taking environmental considerations
  into account, as a consequence of the environmental provision of the revised
  EUROCONTROL Convention (EUROCONTROL, 1997a). </p>
<p>Free Flight and the ATM Strategy for 2000+ were developed to accommodate the
  significant requirements of these two regions of the world within the context
  of ICAO concepts and policies. Remaining regions will be guided more specifically
  by ATM concepts being developed by ICAO. Harmonization of concepts under the
  CNS/ATM umbrella will lead, in theory, to an integrated global ATM system. CNS/ATM
  systems, along with efforts aimed at overcoming national limitations associated
  with sovereignty issues and funding of new systems, should result in a reduction
  in restrictions and a more optimized route system. </p>
<h4><a name="8242"></a>8.2.4.2. Regional Variations </h4>
<p> There are a number of differences between air navigation infrastructure requirements
  in the various regions of the world. The United States and Europe embody the
  differences between two complex and highly developed regions. However, these
  two regions also share some similarities; increased capacity, for example, is
  the primary driver of implementation planning in both regions. On the other
  hand, developing regions are more concerned with improving safety, efficiency,
  and accessibility. </p>
<p>Integration and harmonization of various concepts and needs are required to
  achieve consistency in terms of safety and regularity and to attain the seamlessness
  required for efficient operation. Planning for implementation of improved air
  navigation systems based on CNS/ATM therefore cannot be accomplished in isolation.
  Regional air navigation plans, comprising listings of facilities and services
  required to serve civil aviation, are coordinated through the global mechanisms
  established by ICAO, and the ICAO standards and recommended practices provide
  a common framework for implementation and planning of systems. Regional bodies
  such as the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), the Arab Civil Aviation
  Commission (ACAC), EUROCONTROL, and the Latin American Civil Aviation Commission
  (LACAC) also provide common platforms for planning and implementation while
  ensuring commonality and coherency. Regions also establish bilateral relationships-such
  as between EUROCONTROL and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-to
  address their unique and specific needs and to work more rapidly than traditional
  mechanisms allow. </p>

<h3><a name="825"></a>8.2.5. Environmental Benefits Associated with CNS/ATM Implementation
</h3>
<h4><a name="8251"></a>8.2.5.1. Potential Environmental Benefits </h4>
<p>Several studies associated with implementation of CNS/ATM systems have been
  carried out. Although some of these studies state their results in terms of
  cost/benefit and associated fuel savings and do not specifically address the
  environment, obvious correlations to reduced gaseous emissions (including NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  and carbon dioxide) can be drawn. <a href="123.htm#tab81">Table 8-1</a> provides
  a summary of results from several case studies; this summary is taken from a
  paper presented by ICAO during the worldwide CNS/ATM systems implementation
  conference held in Rio de Janeiro in May 1998 (ICAO, 1998b). A preliminary EUROCONTROL
  study considered various ATM strategies and concepts that have the potential
  to reduce fuel burn. For two particular scenarios-free route airspace above
  10,200 m and unconstrained "direct flight gate-to-gate"-potential savings of
  1-2 and 7-8% were estimated, respectively (EUROCONTROL, 1997b). <a href="123.htm#tab82">Table
  8-2</a> presents the results of a preliminary assessment of potential fuel savings
  and resulting environmental benefits resulting from introduction of CNS/ATM
  in the national airspace system of the United States for the year 2015 (FAA,
  1998b). </p>
<h4><a name="8252"></a>8.2.5.2. Rebound Effects </h4>
<p>Introduction of capacity- and efficiency-enhancing measures such as those associated
  with CNS/ATM systems may attract additional air traffic. This phenomenon is
  referred to as the rebound effect. Introducing efficiencies hitherto not available
  to operators-efficiencies that result in lower fuel consumption and subsequently
  lower operating costs-may reduce fares and stimulate traffic and growth beyond
  that already anticipated based on the forecast demand for air travel. This eventuality
  cannot be overlooked because the net effect could be an increase in air traffic
  and consequently an increase in fuel burn and emissions. It is unclear to what
  extent any additional emissions caused by a rebound effect might offset anticipated
  reductions in emissions arising from CNS/ATM systems implementation. No studies
  providing evidence on the existence or size of the rebound effect have been
  carried out.</p>
