<h4>7.4.1.1. Thermal Efficiency </h4>
<p>One of the most fundamental measures needed to assess the effectiveness of
  a gas turbine is its ability to convert the chemical energy of the fuel into
  mechanical work-the thermal efficiency of the engine (i.e., h<SPAN class="subscript">therm</span> = power to
  the gas stream/ energy input rate). The precise derivation of this parameter
  requires a knowledge of the details of flows within the engine, including air
  used inside the engine to cool hot parts. For present purposes, however, a good
  estimate of the constraints and potential of the engine can be obtained by neglecting
  such minor flows and by further assuming that the working fluid throughout the
  engine retains the same properties as air at room temperature throughout the
  cycle. The compressor and turbine are inevitably less than perfect, and their
  performance is described by efficiencies (h<SPAN class="subscript">comp</span> and h<SPAN class="subscript">turb</span>, respectively). This
  simple treatment assumes that h<SPAN class="subscript">comp</span> = h<SPAN class="subscript">turb</span> = 90%; these are plausible "state-of-the-art"
  values. The two properties that affect gas turbine thermal efficiency are T<SPAN class="subscript">4</span>/T<SPAN class="subscript">2</span>-the
  ratio of temperature leaving the combustor (i.e., the turbine inlet temperature)
  to that of the air entering the engine-and the overall pressure ratio between
  atmospheric pressure and peak pressure within the engine. </p>
<p>Taking first the effects of variations in T<SPAN class="subscript">4</span>/T<SPAN class="subscript">2</span> at typical conditions in the
  cruise phase of a modern civil aircraft (Mach 0.85 at 10.7-km altitude), the
  inlet temperature, T<SPAN class="subscript">2</span>, sensed by the engine for standard atmospheric conditions
  is 250 K. The upper limit on temperature, T<SPAN class="subscript">4</span>, would be reached if sufficient
  hydrocarbon fuel were burned to consume all the oxygen (stoichiometric combustion;
  see <a href="095.htm#img78">Figure 7-8</a>). This temperature would be about
  2590 K, though this value depends to some extent on the pressure ratio of the
  engine and the efficiency of the components. These values give T<SPAN class="subscript">4</span>/T<SPAN class="subscript">2</span> ï¿½ 10.3.
  For a mid-1990s engine the value of T<SPAN class="subscript">4</span> at cruise is about 1400 K, whereas in
  the mid-1970s a value of about 1250 K would have been more typical. For these
  combinations of air inlet temperature, and turbine inlet temperature the ratio
  T<SPAN class="subscript">4</span>/T<SPAN class="subscript">2</span> would be 5.6 and 5.0, respectively. <a href="095.htm#img78">Figure 7-8</a>
  shows, for these three examples, the thermal efficiency of a gas turbine as
  a function of pressure ratio for cruise at Mach 0.85 at 10.7 km. The solid lines
  are for compressor and turbine efficiencies of 90% and are labeled with the
  temperature ratio T<SPAN class="subscript">4</span>/T<SPAN class="subscript">2</span>. The broken line is for ideal compressors and turbines
  (having h<SPAN class="subscript">comp</span> = h<SPAN class="subscript">turb</span> =100%); in this case, the thermal efficiency is a function
  of pressure ratio only. </p>
<p><a href="095.htm#img78">Figure 7-8</a> also shows that for high thermal efficiency,
  the internal pressure ratio of the engine must be moderately high; for new large
  engines, the value is around 40 at peak throttle settings of take-off and climb.
  In addition to "internal" compression of air (by the compressor), the aircraft's
  forward speed introduces a pressure rise of 1.6 times atmospheric pressure at
  Mach 0.85, giving an overall pressure ratio of about 64. Increasing the internal
  pressure ratio much beyond this value raises the temperature at compressor exit
  to the point where materials are a limitation; furthermore, the higher temperature
  increases the problem of cooling the turbine and increases levels of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> production
  in the combustor (as discussed in <a href="099.htm#752">Section 7.5.2</a>).
  Increasing the internal pressure ratio at current values of T<SPAN class="subscript">4</span>/T<SPAN class="subscript">2</span> would offer
  very little improvement in thermal efficiency. </p>

<p>The increase in turbine inlet temperature over the past 20 years has been the
  result of research and development, primarily to increase the power-to-weight
  ratio of the engine. As <a href="095.htm#img78">Figure 7-8</a> shows, however,
  a modest increase in T4/T2 has had an effect on thermal efficiency. At the theoretical
  limit, by operating at stoichiometric fuel-air ratios in the combustion system,
  the temperature ratio would be about double that of current engines. The practical
  difficulties associated with achieving stoichiometric combustion (largely associated
  with maintaining structural integrity with materials that lose strength at high
  temperatures), however, remain formidable. Furthermore, even if these difficulties
  could be overcome, the thermal efficiency of the engine would still remain below
  60% given current levels of turbomachinery component efficiencies. Only when
  hcomp = hturb =100% would thermal efficiency approach 70% for an overall pressure
  ratio of around 64. Thus, although there are clear gains to be made by further
  increases in T4/T2 and thermal efficiency, the full benefits can be achieved
  only through parallel efforts aimed at raising propulsive efficiency. </p>
