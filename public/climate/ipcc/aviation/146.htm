<p>From the implied 2050 fleet sizes, it is likely that more airports will be
  required to support the growth in traffic and flight operations. The number
  of new airports required will depend on the total fleet, the number of airports
  now capable of handling jet operations, and the number of gates available at
  each airport. <a href="144.htm#tab926">Table 9-26</a> shows the number of new
  airports required, assuming the lowest and highest growth cases for the passenger
  fleet and total fleet (from model by Campbell-Hill Aviation Group, 1998). The
  present inventory of airports was taken as the number of airports now having
  one or more jet departures per day, thereby obviously capable of handling large
  jet transport aircraft, and the total number of airports in the OAG-that is,
  airports with scheduled air service (many not presently capable of handling
  large jet transport aircraft). For example, if all of the airports now having
  one or more jet departures per day had 15 or more gates, no new airports would
  be needed to handle the fleet in the lowest growth case. Conversely, the highest
  growth case would require more than 1,300 new airports of 15 gates each (two
  new airports per month for 60 years) even if all 3,750 airports now listed in
  the OAG had 15 gates and were capable of handling large jet transport aircraft
  (which they do not and are not). This analysis ignores infrastructure location
  and the problems associated with its provision. In populous parts of the world,
  where civil aviation is established, the addition of airport capacity is often
  difficult given local environmental pressures such developments create. However,
  in developing countries, where much of the future traffic growth is anticipated,
  new infrastructure might encounter less environmental sensitivity and therefore
  be more readily provided. Nonetheless, the infrastructure projects required
  to satisfy the highest growth scenarios are unprecedented in scope. </p>
<h4><a name="9663"></a>9.6.6.3. Fuel Availability </h4>
<p>All of the 2050 scenarios imply large increases in fuel consumption by aircraft.
  In the highest FESG scenario (Fe2), aircraft fuel consumption increases from
  139 to 772 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup> over the period 1992 to 2050. In the highest EDF scenario
  (Eeh), the increase is from 179 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup> in 1990 to 2,297 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup> in 2050. Because
  both scenarios are based on the IS92e scenario, it is appropriate to compare
  these figures to total energy use in the IS92e scenario. According to scenario
  Fe2, aircraft will account for 13% of the total transportation energy usage
  in 2050 and require 15% of the world's liquid fossil fuel production. The EDF
  scenario (Eeh) implies that aircraft account for 39% of the transportation energy
  usage and require 45% of the world's liquid fuel production. These comparisons
  assume that aircraft do not use biomass fuels or fuels derived from natural
  gas. </p>
<p>Under either scenario, the world will be straining the limits of conventional
  oil resources by 2050. Total remaining resources of conventional petroleum,
  discovered and undiscovered, have been estimated at between one trillion (Campbell
  and Laherrere, 1998) and two trillion barrels (Masters et al., 1994-based on
  the optimistic 5% probability estimate of undiscovered oil). The IS92e scenario
  implies cumulative production of liquid fuels of 1 trillion barrels by 2025
  and 2 trillion barrels by 2050. Cumulative consumption by 2050 by aircraft alone
  amounts to 0.15 trillion barrels in the Fe2 scenario and 0.35 trillion barrels
  in the Eeh scenario. However, production of liquid fuels is not necessarily
  limited by conventional oil resources. Liquid fuels can be produced from heavy
  oil, tar sands, oil shale, or even coal, albeit with significantly greater environmental
  consequences and at higher costs. High fuel prices would violate the explicit
  assumptions used in developing the scenarios. </p>
<h4><a name="9664"></a>9.6.6.4. Manufacturing Capability and Trends in Aircraft
  Capacity</h4>
<p>In 1997, the global aircraft manufacturing capability delivered 634 passenger
  jet aircraft, bringing the global jet passenger fleet to approximately 10,000
  aircraft. The rate of new aircraft deliveries has followed a generally increasing
  trend since the mid-1950s, and this trend must continue over the scenario period
  to satisfy predicted demand for new and replacement aircraft. For the demand
  cases examined above, deliveries of new aircraft are estimated to reflect the
  schedule given in <a href="145.htm#tab927">Table 9-27</a>. </p>
<p>The delivery rate for the Fa1 and Fa2 scenarios would be achievable with existing
  manufacturing capacity. The delivery rate required by the highest scenario,
  Eeh, implies a considerable increase in manufacturing capacity-approximately
  six times that existing today. Although this level is not impossible, such an
  expansion of aircraft manufacturing capability is likely to be difficult to
  achieve and sustain during the period. The Eab scenario implies a delivery rate
  that is approximately three times the level existing today, which is not implausible
  for 2050. </p>
<p>One assumption intrinsic to the fleet size analysis was that the average number
  of seats per aircraft will increase by 1% each year, reflecting current trends.
  This assumption has a large effect on fleet size estimates, particularly for
  high-demand cases. As a sensitivity analysis, the factor was changed to 2% per
  year for the Eeh high scenario and for the Fa1 and Fa2 scenarios. Such a change
  may reflect potential market pressures for larger aircraft, which is not inappropriate
  for a high traffic growth scenario. The results are given in <a href="145.htm#tab928">Table
  9-28</a>. </p>
<p>As this analysis shows, a different assumption in aircraft size growth has
  a significant effect on the estimated future fleet. The projected numbers of
  the largest aircraft types (between 625 and 799 seats) in future fleets are
  particularly sensitive in this analysis, which suggests that there might be
  more than 7,000 such aircraft in the fleet by 2050 in the Eeh scenario (compared
  with about 10,000 passenger aircraft of all sizes today) or about 4,000 additional
  aircraft for the more conservative Fa1 and Fa2 scenarios. </p>
<p>Increased capacity can be supplied by additional aircraft, increased flying
  hours (i.e., more efficient use of the fleet), larger aircraft, or a combination
  of these factors. The high aircraft growth assumption used as a sensitivity
  analysis here suggests that about 70% of future capacity growth will be supplied
  by an increase in aircraft size. Although such an industry trend is not impossible,
  it is unlikely to occur in such a prescriptive manner if the industry remains
  relatively deregulated. Deregulation tends to favor increased frequency and
  direct flights with smaller aircraft between departure and destination. However,
  it is likely that some markets would favor the proliferation of very large aircraft,
  especially those with dense traffic flows. The size of the fleets suggested
  by the 2% per year aircraft size growth assumption must therefore be regarded
  as toward the low end of the range.</p>
<h4><a name="9665"></a>9.6.6.5. Synthesis of Plausibility Analyses</h4>
<p>Given the range of estimates for traffic, fuel consumption, and emissions from
  the 2050 aircraft scenarios available to this assessment, it is necessary to
  comment on the plausibility of the results-not least to demonstrate that results
  used in subsequent analyses are bounded by sensible limits within which the
  aviation industry is currently envisaged to develop. </p>
<p>The foregoing analyses suggest that although none of the scenarios considered
  for 2050 is impossible, some of the high-growth scenarios (e.g., Eah and Eeh)
  are probably less plausible. The fleet size and infrastructure implications
  suggest radical developments that are likely to be beyond the scope of changes
  observed in the industry thus far (or anticipated for the future). Similarly,
  the low-growth scenarios-though plausible in terms of achievability-give traffic
  estimates that are likely to be exceeded given the present state of the industry
  and planned developments. Although all of the FESG scenarios discount the possibility
  of truly radical developments in technology over the next 50 years, they are
  considered to fall within a plausible range of outcomes and suggest achievable
  developments for the industry. </p>
<p>The 3-D gridded output from scenarios Fa-Fe (with T1 and T2 technology scenarios)
  and from DTI are suitable for use as input to chemical transport models and
  may be used to calculate the effect of aviation CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions. Scenarios Eab
  and Edh are suitable for use in <a href="063.htm">Chapter 6</a> to calculate
  the effect of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions as sensitivity analyses because the latter scenario
  projects CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions levels from aviation that are 2.2 times greater in 2050
  than the highest of the FESG scenarios. <a href="145.htm#tab929">Table 9-29</a>
  provides a summary of all of the long-term scenarios examined in the chapter.</p>
