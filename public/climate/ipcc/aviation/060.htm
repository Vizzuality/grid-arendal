<p><a href="059.htm#img55">Figure 5-5</a> shows calculated ozone column changes as
  a function of latitude for July and October and for a range of scenarios. The
  top panel shows the change in columns attributable to subsonic fleets over the
  period 1992-2050 relative to a background atmosphere of the same year. The corresponding
  calculations for 1970 are not shown, but the effects attributable to aircraft
  for this period were very much smaller than any shown in the top panel of <a href="059.htm#img55">Figure
  5-5</a> (see <a href="060.htm#img56">Figures 5-6</a>, <a href="avf5-7.htm">5-7</a>,
  and <a href="avf5-8.htm">5-8</a>). The middle panel shows a corresponding calculation
  for the hybrid (subsonic+supersonic) fleets for 2015 and 2050, and the bottom
  panel shows the changes in background between 2050 and 1970, between 2015 and
  1970, and between 1992 and 1970. The major features of the aircraft impact on
  ozone have been discussed in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>. For the background
  atmospheres (bottom panel), the calculations predict a systematic increase in
  ozone after 1992. For the Southern Hemisphere, this outcome is largely because
  of the expected decrease in bromine and chlorine. The additional increase in
  ozone in the Northern Hemisphere relative to the Southern Hemisphere is because
  the projected release of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> at the surface is greater in the Northern Hemisphere.
</p>
<h4><i><a name="5422"></a>5.4.2.2. Calculated Changes in Ozone Compared to Changes
  in UV</i> </h4>
<p>An alternative to the method of presentation of results used in <a href="059.htm#img55">Figure
  5-5</a> is to show the evolution of changes in ozone and UV as a function of
  time, as in <a href="060.htm#img56">Figure 5-6</a>. Here, calculated ozone and
  UVery averaged between 65�S and 65�N for July and for a range of scenarios are
  referred to calculated background values for 1970. When averages are taken over
  a broad latitude band such as that in <a href="060.htm#img56">Figure 5-6,</a> seasonal
  behavior is removed, to a large extent. However, a particular latitude may exhibit
  significant seasonal behavior in the calculated departure from background values
  for 1970. For example, <a href="060.htm#img57">Figure 5-7</a> shows calculated
  changes for 45�N for January, and <a href="060.htm#img58">Figure 5-8</a> shows
  the corresponding calculations for July. Comparison of Figures <a href="avf5-7.htm">5-7</a>
  and <a href="avf5-8.htm">5-8</a> shows that, although the calculated ozone and
  UVery for the background in 2050 for January are little different from the corresponding
  values for 1970, there are significant departures in July. This result is almost
  certainly because of the increased ozone calculated for the upper troposphere
  in 2050 resulting from the increase in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> released from the surface of the
  Earth relative to 1970. </p>
<p>The method of presentation shown in Figures <a href="avf5-6.htm">5-6</a>, <a href="avf5-7.htm">5-7</a>,
  and <a href="avf5-8.htm">5-8</a> has the advantage that the predicted impact
  of either the hybrid fleet or the subsonic fleet on the background atmosphere
  at the corresponding time can easily be determined from the diagram; in addition,
  the departure for any of the scenarios from the calculated value for the background
  atmosphere in 1970 is readily determined. However, this method of presentation
  does not show changes as a function of latitude; that information is provided
  in <a href="060.htm#img59">Figure 5-9</a>, which shows percentage UVery changes
  for July and October corresponding to ozone changes in <a href="059.htm#img55">Figure
  5-5</a>. The labels on the diagram refer to the atmospheres defined in <a href="059.htm#tab52">Table
  5-2</a>. </p>
<p>The three panels in <a href="060.htm#img59">Figure 5-9</a> show the calculated
  changes in UVery for subsonics (top), subsonics+supersonics (middle), and changes
  in ground emissions (bottom). Several trends are clear from <a href="060.htm#img59">Figure
  5-9</a>. First, the impact of subsonic aviation is significantly greater in
  2015 and 2050 than in 1992 (top panel); at northern mid-latitudes, the impact
  of the subsonic fleet is roughly proportional to the levels of aircraft emissions
  assumed. Second, when the effect of the hybrid fleet is compared to the corresponding
  background, there is an increase in UVery relative to the case where a pure
  subsonic fleet is considered (compare the top and middle panels). Third, calculated
  changes in UVery relative to 1970 for present and future background atmospheres
  show an increase in 1992 and a systematic decrease thereafter (bottom panel).
  This behavior is directly related to the levels of bromine and chlorine assumed
  for the stratosphere and the amount of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> assumed to be released from the surface
  of the Earth. </p>
<h4><i><a name="5423"></a>5.4.2.3. Treatment of Uncertainties in Ozone Change
  and UVery Change Calculations </i></h4>
<p>The calculations reported in Sections <a href="060.htm#5421">5.4.2.1</a> and
  <a href="060.htm#5422">5.4.2.2</a> are based on information provided in <a href="044.htm">Chapter
  4</a>. In that chapter, calculations were carried out for a number of scenarios
  corresponding to the years 1992, 2015, and 2050. For 1992, the calculated impact
  of the subsonic fleet on atmospheric ozone was estimated using a 3-D CTM. Similar
  calculations were performed to assess the expected impact of subsonic aircraft
  in 2015 and 2050. In addition, the impact of hybrid fleets of subsonic and supersonic
  aircraft for 2015 and 2050 were obtained using a combination of 2-D and 3-D
  chemical transport calculations. The results for the hybrid fleet in Sections
  <a href="060.htm#5421">5.4.2.1</a> and <a href="060.htm#5422">5.4.2.2</a> are
  based on calculations provided in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> for the AER
  model for scenarios S1k-D for 2015 and S9h-D9 for 2050. These scenarios are
  defined in Tables <a href="049.htm#tab410">4-10</a>, <a href="049.htm#tab411">4-11</a>,
  and <a href="049.htm#tab412">4-12</a>. In addition to performing these calculations,
  the authors of <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> set uncertainty limits on these
  results. For ozone changes resulting from the impact of the subsonic fleets,
  the uncertainty was taken to be a factor of two times the difference obtained
  by the Oslo 3-D model for scenarios (B-A), (D-C), and (F-E) defined in <a href="047.htm#tab44">Table
  4-4</a>. The quoted uncertainties are taken as the 67% likelihood range. We
  believe that uncertainty in the calculation of ozone percentage changes is by
  far the greatest uncertainty in the determination of percentage changes in UVery;
  accordingly, we have not added additional uncertainties to the range supplied
  by <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>. In addition, our assessment of the confidence
  in these calculations is as given by <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>-that is,
  "fair" for 2015 and "poor" for 2050. </p>
<p><a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> considered three components in assessing the
  uncertainty for the impact of the hybrid fleet on ozone: The spread obtained
  by a number of models for a range of plausible scenarios, uncertainties in chemical
  rate coefficients, and uncertainties introduced by inaccurate treatment of atmospheric
  circulation in the models. <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> concluded that the
  annually averaged impact on ozone for the Northern Hemisphere of a hybrid fleet
  in 2050 (including 1,000 HSCTs) would be in the range of -3.5 to +1% when compared
  with the impact of the subsonic fleet and that the best estimate is<sup>-1</sup>% given
  by the AER 2-D model. The uncertainty range again represents the 67% likelihood
  range with a confidence in this</p>
<p>uncertainty range of "fair." As with estimated subsonic impacts, we believe
  that the uncertainty in the change in ozone caused by the hybrid fleet is much
  greater than any other uncertainties in the calculation of changes in UVery.
  <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> has provided only an annually averaged Northern
  Hemisphere value because it is not possible at present to assign uncertainty
  factors as functions of latitude, altitude, and season. The large variations
  in ozone changes predicted by a range of models as functions of latitude, altitude,
  and season (see Figures <a href="avf4-6c.htm">4-6c</a>, <a href="avf4-6d.htm">4-6d</a>,
  <a href="avf4-12.htm">4-12a</a>, and <a href="avf4-12.htm">4-12b</a>) are clear
  indications of shortcomings inherent in current models. </p>
<p>Given that the predicted change in UVery is primarily a function of changes
  in the ozone column and is less sensitive to the exact altitude dependence of
  the ozone change, an estimate of the uncertainty for changes in ozone columns
  as a function of latitude and season should be sufficient. This chapter uses
  the subjective estimates of uncertainties from <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4 </a>and
  defines the 67% likelihood range for changes in ozone columns at each latitude
  and season as follows. If the column change predicted by the AER 2-D model at
  latitude (Q) and time of year (T) is a(Q,T)%, the uncertainty range in percent
  column ozone change at that latitude and time of year is given by [a(Q,T) -3]%
  to [a(Q,T) +2]%. The same definition will be adopted for fleet sizes of either
  500 or 1,000 HSCTs. These estimates are very subjective; although the confidence
  attached to these uncertainties for the tropics is "good," outside the tropics
  the confidence can be considered only "fair." In the absence of a rigorous method
  of obtaining uncertainties, this chapter also assumes that there is a 5% range
  in estimated uncertainties for change in UVery; this range is given by [b(Q,T)
  -2]% to [b(Q,T) +3]%, where b(Q,T)% is the percent change in UVery corresponding
  to a(Q,T)% change in ozone column. In summary, uncertainties in the impact of
  the subsonic fleet on UVery may be obtained from any of the diagrams in this
  chapter that report this change simply by doubling or halving the change shown
  in the diagram. For example, in the top panel of <a href="060.htm#img59">Figure
  5-9</a>, the change in UVery shown for the subsonic impact for July of 2015
  at 45�N is -0.9%. Accordingly, the 67% likelihood range for this particular
  change is<sup>-1</sup>.8 to -0.5%; because it is a calculation for 2050, our confidence
  in this result is "poor" as prescribed by <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>. Similarly,
  in the middle panel of <a href="060.htm#img59">Figure 5-9</a>, the impact of the
  hybrid fleet at the equator in July of 2050 is shown as -0.2%. This impact is
  based on a calculation of ozone changes by the AER 2-D model. From the discussion
  above, we determined the 67% likelihood range for this impact to be -2.2 to
  +2.8%, and our estimate of the confidence is "good." At 65�N in July of 2050
  (middle panel of <a href="060.htm#img59">Figure 5-9</a>), the calculated impact
  of the hybrid fleet on UVery is +0.5%, which gives<sup>-1</sup>.5 to +3.5% as the 67%
  likelihood range with an estimated confidence of "fair." </p>
<p>As discussed in <a href="059.htm#5411">Section 5.4.1.1</a>, the calculations
  shown in <a href="060.htm#img56">Figures 5-6</a> to <a href="avf5-9.htm">5-9</a>
  include percent changes in UVery for the background atmosphere using 1970 as
  the reference year. At 45�N in July, these changes are +8, +3, and -3% for 1992,
  2015, and 2050, respectively. At 45�S in January, the calculated changes are
  +9, +4.5, and 0% for 1992, 2015, and 2050, respectively. For comparison, the
  computed change due to observed ozone depletion at 35-50�N in July is about
  4% over the period 1970-1992 (WMO, 1999). The corresponding change for 35-50�S
  in January is 8%. </p>
<h4><i><a name="5424"></a>5.4.2.4. Contribution of Persistent Contrails, Cirrus
  Clouds, and Aerosols to the Impact of Aviation on UV </i></h4>
<p>The geographic and temporal variability associated with clouds and aerosols
  complicates attempts to make general statements concerning their effects on
  UV irradiance. Nonetheless, this section considers some highly simplified scenarios
  to place bounds on the influence of altered contrails, cirrus, and aerosol amounts.
  There are three issues to address: The effect of regional, persistent contrails;
  the effect of observed trends in cirrus that may result from a variety of processes,
  including aviation; and the effect of aviation-produced aerosols. </p>
<p>To estimate the effects of persistent contrails on ground-level UV, calculations
  assume a 5% area coverage, appropriate to the local maximum over the eastern
  United States of America (see <a href="038.htm#343">Section 3.4.3</a>), and
  a contrail optical thickness of 0.3. For latitude 45�N summer, local noon, this
  scenario leads to a reduction in UVery of 0.2% relative to clear skies. If persistent
  contrail coverage were to increase to 10%, the corresponding reduction in UVery
  would be 0.4%. </p>
<p>The observed trends in cirrus presented in <a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a>
  include the effects of aviation, as well as any other influences that may be
  operative. The estimated response of UVery to trends in the cirrus background
  is based on the following assumptions: The cirrus have a scattering optical
  thickness of 0.3, and initially 23% of the land area is covered by cirrus at
  an altitude of 11 km. Starting from this condition, an increase of 3.5% per
  decade in the land area covered by cirrus, appropriate to the United States
  of America in spring (<a href="038.htm#img319">Figure 3-19</a>), leads to a decline
  in UVery of approximately 0.1% per decade for local noon at latitude 45�N. If
  changes in persistent contrails and cirrus, especially on regional scales, differ
  substantially from the estimates adopted above, the resulting changes in UVery
  would have to be modified accordingly. The numbers given here point to the magnitude
  of reasonable changes, but they should not be viewed as predictions of the future.
</p>
  The aircraft-related perturbation to atmospheric optical depth in the UV from
  soot and sulfate aerosols is very small compared to the natural background opacity.
  The values presented in <a href="036.htm#tab34">Table 3-4</a> imply enhanced
  aerosol optical depths for soot and sulfates of less than 10<sup>-3</sup>. The decrease
  in UVery associated with such perturbations is less than 0.1%. Calculations
  indicate that, although an increase in aerosols in the background atmosphere
  between 1970 and 2050 from sources other than aviation would result in a reduction
  of UVery relative to clear skies, the percent change in UVery attributable to
  aviation is relatively insensitive to background aerosol loading.<br>
