<h3>6.4.2. Direct Radiative Forcing from Black Carbon Aerosols </h3>
<p>Tropospheric black carbon (BC) aerosol, also described as soot, primarily absorbs
  incident solar radiation, which leads to positive radiative forcing. As in the
  case of sulfate aerosol, the small size of the particles means that radiative
  forcing in the longwave region of the spectrum is likely to be negligible. The
  sensitivity of global mean radiative forcing to column loading of total anthropogenic
  BC is estimated by Haywood et al. (1997a), Haywood and Ramaswamy (1998), and
  Myhre et al. (1998) to range from approximately +1100 to +1850 W g<font size="-1">-1</font>
  BC. </p>
<p>We reexamined results by inserting BC aerosol in a layer between 8 and 13 km
  in the GFDL R30 GCM using the method of Haywood and Ramaswamy (1998). A log-normal
  distribution with a geometric mean radius of 0.0118 µm and a standard deviation
  of 2.0 was assumed. The resulting global mean sensitivity was found to be approximately
  +3000 W g<font size="-1">-1</font> BC as a result of the higher sensitivity
  of the radiative forcing when the BC exists at higher altitudes above a greater
  proportion of cloudy layers (Haywood and Ramaswamy, 1998). This value is adopted
  throughout this report because it explicitly takes into account the effect of
  the elevated altitude of the aerosol. </p>
<p>BC particles primarily absorb sunlight and heat the local air. Thus, unlike
  BC that resides in the troposphere, BC in the stratosphere contributes negative
  solar radiative forcing that is countered by induced positive longwave radiative
  forcing. Thus, radiative forcing from BC aerosols is sensitive to their location
  relative to the tropopause. We do not have enough information on the location
  of BC relative to the tropopause, and thus our use of the instantaneous top-of-atmosphere
  value overestimates the RF depending on the fraction of aircraft BC in the lower
  stratosphere. </p>
<p>Using the aircraft fuel-burn scenarios for NASA-1992 noted above and described
  in <a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a>, we derive a global mean column burden of
  BC aerosol from aircraft of 1.0 µg BC m<font size="-1">-2</font> (assuming an
  EI(BC) of 0.04 g kg<font size="-1">-1</font>; see also <a href="036.htm#tab34">Table
  3-4</a>). Thus, we estimate global mean BC aerosol forcing in 1992 to be +0.003
  (+0.001 to +0.006) W m<font size="-1">-2</font> and assume that it linearly
  scales with fuel use (see also <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table 6-1</a>). This
  value is much smaller in absolute magnitude than the RF from CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>,
  O<font size="-2">3</font>, CH<font size="-2">4</font>, or contrails. </p>
<h3>
  6.4.3. Radiative Forcing from Persistent Contrails and Indirect Effects on Clouds
  <a name="643"></a> </h3>
<p>Aircraft emission of water vapor and particles, as well as the creation of
  contrails, could lead to a change in global cloudiness. Some atmospheric GCM
  studies that have looked at the impacts of injecting water vapor or creating
  contrails (e.g., Ponater et al., 1996; Rind et al. 1996) point to the potential
  importance of these effects on climate, but these pilot studies cannot be used
  directly in this assessment. Persistent contrails clearly related to aircraft
  are detectable, however, and their impact on radiative forcing can be evaluated.
  <a href="040.htm">Section 3.6</a> (see <a href="040.htm#tab39">Table 3-9</a>)
  estimates direct radiative forcing from persistent contrails to be +0.02 (+0.005
  to +0.06) W m<font size="-1">-2</font> in 1992 (see also <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table
  6-1</a>). This estimate is limited to immediately visible, quasi-linear persistent
  contrails.</p>
<p>Whereas contrail formation and associated radiative forcing is an obvious and
  visible consequence of aircraft activity, the secondary, indirect effect of
  aerosols from aircraft on the microphysical and radiative properties of clouds
  is a very complex issue that has received little attention and is very difficult
  to quantify (Seinfeld, 1998). Some significant steps in quantifying the indirect
  effect from anthropogenic aerosols have been made (e.g., Jones et al., 1994;
  Boucher and Lohmann, 1995). The effects of aerosol particles from aircraft emissions
  on clouds are more complicated because nucleation and subsequent growth of ice
  crystals that make up cirrus clouds are more complex and less studied than for
  water clouds. Cirrus cloud generally exert positive forcing because longwave
  positive radiative forcing is of a larger magnitude than solar negative radiative
  forcing. <a href="040.htm#365">Section 3.6.5</a> (see <a href="040.htm#tab39">Table
  3-9</a>) estimates that radiative forcing from aircraft-induced cirrus is positive
  and may be comparable to contrail RF. The magnitude of this RF remains very
  uncertain. No best estimate is given in <a href="068.htm#tab61">Tables 6-1</a>
  and <a href="068.htm#tab62">6-2</a>, but a range for the best estimate could
  fall between 0 and 0.04 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>. </p>
