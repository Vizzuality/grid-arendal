<h2><b>3.4. Contrail Occurrence and Persistence and Impact of Aircraft Exhaust
  on Cirrus </b></h2>
<p>Aircraft cause visible changes in the atmosphere by forming contrails that
  represent artificially induced cirrus clouds. The conditions under which contrails
  form are discussed in <a href="035.htm#324">Section 3.2.4</a>. This section
  describes the formation, occurrence, and properties of persistent contrails
  and how they compare with natural cirrus. </p>
<h3><i><b><a name="341"></a>3.4.1. Cirrus and Contrails </b></i></h3>
<p>Cirrus clouds (Liou, 1986; Pruppacher and Klett, 1997) contain mainly ice crystals
  (Weickmann, 1945). The distinctive properties of cirrus and contrails derive
  from the physics of ice formation. Ice particle nucleation occurs either through
  homogeneous nucleation (when pure water droplets or liquid aerosol particles
  freeze) or through heterogeneous nucleation, when freezing of the liquid is
  triggered by a solid particle or surface that is in contact with the liquid
  or suspended within the liquid. Both processes depend strongly on temperature
  and relative humidity (Heymsfield and Miloshevich, 1995; see <a href="035.htm#3242">Section
  3.2.4.2</a>). </p>
<p>Comparisons of model simulations with observations suggest that we may understand
  homogeneous nucleation (Str�m et al., 1997; Jensen et al., 1998b) and are making
  headway in understanding the potential contribution of heterogeneous nucleation
  (DeMott et al., 1998; Rogers et al., 1998). Each of these freezing mechanisms
  requires that the atmosphere be highly supersaturated with respect to the vapor
  pressure of ice before crystals can form. For instance, supersaturations in
  excess of 40-50% with respect to ice are needed for sulfuric acid particles
  to freeze homogeneously (Tabazadeh et al., 1997) at temperatures above 200 K.
  Observations of relative humidity with respect to ice at the leading edges of
  wave clouds are consistent with the requirement of large ice supersaturations
  for nucleation of ice on the bulk of the atmospheric aerosol (Heymsfield et
  al., 1998a; Jensen et al., 1998c). Hence, there is a large supersaturation range
  in which heterogeneous nuclei could lead to cirrus formation before the bulk
  of the atmospheric particles freeze (DeMott et al., 1997). This potential for
  heterogeneous nuclei to cause ice formation at ice supersaturations that are
  relatively low compared to those needed to freeze sulfate particles leads to
  concern about the role of aircraft exhaust in modifying ambient clouds (Jensen
  and Toon, 1997). </p>

<p>Ice crystal number densities are limited by competition between increasing
  saturation as a result of cooling in vertical updrafts and decreasing saturation
  as a result of growth of ice crystals. The depletion of vapor as a result of
  growth of the first few ice crystals nucleated prevents further ice nucleation
  on the remaining particles (Jensen and Toon, 1994). Once ice crystals form and
  take up available water vapor, supersaturation declines and further nucleation
  of ice ceases. This selectivity causes ice crystals in cirrus to be larger relative
  to droplets in liquid water-containing clouds-apart from differences in saturation
  vapor pressures over ice compared to water, which causes more water vapor to
  be available for deposition on ice particles than on water droplets. Large ice
  particles may precipitate rapidly. Many cirrus clouds have a "fuzzy" appearance
  because rapid precipitation causes optically thin edges of clouds to be diffuse,
  and precipitation allows particles to spread in the wind, forming long tails
  of cloud. Ice crystal nucleation also depends on available aerosol in the upper
  troposphere, the properties of which are only poorly known (Str�m and Heintzenberg,
  1994; Podzimek et al., 1995; Sassen et al., 1995; Schr�der and Str�m, 1997).
  In some locations, upper tropospheric particles are dominated by sulfates (Yamato
  and Ono, 1989; Sheridan et al., 1994). However, more recent data show that minerals,
  organic compounds, metals, and other substances may often be present in significant
  quantities (Chen et al., 1998; Talbot et al., 1998). </p>
<p>Cirrus clouds occur mainly in the upper troposphere. The mean tropopause altitude
  is about 16 km in the tropics and 10 km (250 hPa) north of 45�N latitude (Hoinka,
  1998). The tropopause temperature at northern mid-latitudes varies typically
  between -40 and -65�C; it may reach below -80�C in the tropics. At mid-latitudes,
  the upper troposphere often is humid enough for cirrus and persistent contrails
  to form. The stratosphere is commonly so dry that cirrus (PSCs) and persistent
  contrails form only in polar winter (for T > -60�C and p < 250 hPa, a 10-ppmv
  H<span class="subscript">2</span>O mixing ratio corresponds to less than 15% relative humidity). Ground-based
  observers report a mean cirrus cover of 13% over oceans and 23% over land (Warren
  et al., 1986, 1988). Satellite data (Wang et al., 1996; Wylie and Menzel, 1999)
  identify larger cloud cover (~40%) by subvisible (optical depth t at 0.55 mm
  below ~0.03) and semi-transparent (0.1 < t < 0.6) cirrus clouds. Cirrus clouds
  are typically 1.5 (0.1 to 4) km thick; are centered at 9 (4 to 18) km altitude;
  have a crystal concentration of 30 (10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup>) L-1, with crystal lengths of
  250 (1 to 8000) �m (see Dowling and Radke, 1990); and have an optical depth
  at 0.55 �m of about 0.3 (0.01 to 30) (Wylie and Menzel, 1999). These typical
  values of cirrus crystal concentration and mean particle size may be biased
  by early studies that failed to make adequate measurements of ice crystals smaller
  than about 50 �m. More recent studies suggest that crystal concentrations in
  cirrus are often on the order of 1 cm<sup>-3</sup> (Str�m et al., 1997; Schr�der et al.,
  1998b), although crystal concentrations in wave clouds can exceed 10 cm<sup>-3</sup>. PSCs
  (between the tropopause and ~25-km altitude) and noctilucent clouds (~80-km
  altitude) contain ice and might therefore be included as very high altitude
  forms of cirrus clouds. Systems of cirrus clouds have a lifetime that may reach
  several hours or even days (Ludlam, 1980), but the lifetimes of particles within
  clouds is much shorter. </p>

</table>
<p>Persistent contrail formation requires air that is ice-supersaturated (Brewer,
  1946). Ice-supersaturated air is often free of visible clouds (Sassen, 1997)
  because the supersaturation is too small for ice particle nucleation to occur
  (Heymsfield et al., 1998b). Supersaturated regions are expected to be quite
  common in the upper troposphere (Ludlam, 1980). The presence of persistent contrails
  demonstrates that the upper troposphere contains air that is ice-supersaturated
  but will not form clouds unless initiated by aircraft exhaust (Jensen et al.,
  1998a). Aircraft initiate contrail formation by increasing the humidity within
  their exhaust trails, whereas local atmospheric conditions govern the subsequent
  evolution of contrail cirrus clouds. Indeed, the ice mass in long-lasting contrails
  originates almost completely from ambient water vapor (Knollenberg, 1972). </p>
<p>Ice-supersaturated air masses are often formed when ice-saturated air masses
  are lifted by ambient air motions. While the air lifted, it may remain cloud-free
  until it is cooled adiabatically to near-liquid saturation (Ludlam, 1980). Other
  evidence for large supersaturation occurring in the upper troposphere is provided
  by cirrus fallstreaks that grow while falling through supersaturated air layers
  (Ludlam, 1980) and by a few localized humidity measurements (Brewer, 1946; Murphy
  et al., 1990; Ovarlez et al., 1997; Heymsfield et al., 1998b). Recent humidity
  measurements by commercial aircraft show that-in flights between Europe, North
  and South America, Africa, and Asia-14% of flight time was in air masses that
  were ice-supersaturated with a mean value of 15% (Helten et al., 1998; Gierens
  et al., 1999). </p>
<h3><b><i><a name="342"></a>3.4.2 Cirrus and Contrail Models </i></b></h3>
<p>Small-scale, regional, and global models have been used to study cirrus clouds
  and contrails. Small-scale models simulate the details of cloud formation in
  a single parcel of air along some defined trajectory (e.g., Jensen et al., 1994b).
  High-resolution 2-D models have simulated the dynamics and microphysics of cirrus
  (Starr and Cox, 1985) and contrails (Gierens, 1996; Chlond, 1998). Regional
  and global models describe the large-scale dynamics of clouds with simpler representations
  of microphysical cloud processes (Sundqvist, 1993; Lohmann and Roeckner, 1995;
  Fowler et al., 1996; Westphal et al., 1996). Regional-scale (typically 10-km
  horizontal grid-scale) and global-scale models are not able to resolve the vertical
  motions and small-scale temperature and humidity fluctuations (Gierens et al.,
  1997) that drive supersaturations involved in cirrus nucleation. However, global
  models with prescribed or parameterized contrail cover have been useful for
  understanding the radiative impact of a change in cloud cover as a result of
  aircraft emissions (Ponater et al., 1996). </p>

<h3><b><i><a name="343"></a>3.4.3. Contrail Occurrence</i></b></h3>
<p> At plume ages between 1 min and 1 h, contrails grow much faster horizontally
  (to several km width) than vertically (200 to 400 m), especially in highly sheared
  environments (Freudenthaler et al., 1995, 1996; Sassen, 1997). Young contrails
  spread as a result of turbulence created by aircraft vortices (Lewellen and
  Lewellen, 1996; Gerz et al., 1998; Jensen et al., 1998a,b,c), shear in the ambient
  wind field (Freudenthaler et al., 1995; Schumann et al., 1995; D�rbeck and Gerz,
  1996; Gierens, 1996), and possibly radiatively driven mixing (Jensen et al.,
  1998d). </p>
<p>Contrails often become wide and thick enough to induce radiative disturbances
  that are sufficient to be detectable in multispectral satellite observations.
  They have been observed at 1-km spatial resolution with instruments such as
  the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board National Oceanic
  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellites (e.g., Lee,
  1989) and at 4-km resolution in the infrared with the Geostationary Operational
  Environmental Satellite (GOES) (Minnis et al., 1998a). The AVHRR channels in
  the 11- to 12-�m range (4 and 5) are particularly suited to detect thin ice
  clouds because of the different emissivity of ice particles in this spectral
  range (King et al., 1992; Minnis et al., 1998c). <a href="038.htm#img312">Figure
  3-12</a> shows, for example, a mid-European scene derived from AVHRR data in
  these channels, combined with the visible channel to represent the surface,
  for a day when many line-shaped contrails were formed by heavy air traffic (Mannstein,
  1997). The figure shows that aircraft trigger contrail cirrus that evolves into
  cirrus clouds that are much more extensive in scale than the initial contrails.
  Such spread and deformed contrail cirrus can no longer be distinguished from
  naturally occurring cirrus. In <a href="038.htm#img312">Figure 3-12</a>, contrails
  that still have a line-shaped appearance cover about 5% of the scene. </p>

<p>Aged contrails often cannot be distinguished from cirrus, which poses an observational
  problem in determining the frequency and area of coverage by contrails. An important
  example of the persistence of contrails and their evolution into more extensive
  cirrus is shown in <a href="038.htm#img313">Figure 3-13</a>. An initial oval contrail
  observed in GOES-8 satellite images diffused as it was advected over California
  until it no longer resembled its initial shape 3 h later (Minnis et al., 1998a).
  The exhaust from this single aircraft flying for less than 1 h in a moist atmosphere
  caused a cirrus cloud that eventually covered up to 4,000 km<sup>2</sup> and lasted for
  more than 6 h. Other contrails and contrail clusters were observed to develop
  over periods of 7 to 17 h, spreading to cover areas of 12,000 to 35,000 km<sup>2</sup>.
  Such dispersed contrails are usually indistinguishable from natural cirrus;
  hence, satellite detection algorithms based on the linear structures of young
  contrails will not detect these dispersed contrails. </p>
<p>At present, observations of actual frequency or areal coverage of Earth by
  contrails are limited to a few selected regions. Contrail frequency refers to
  the probability that a contrail will be observed somewhere within the scene
  being viewed; area of coverage refers to the fraction of the area of the scene
  in which contrails are observed. Estimates of contrail coverage or occurrence
  have been made directly or indirectly from surface (Detwiler and Pratt, 1984;
  Minnis et al., 1997) and satellite observations (Joseph et al., 1975; Carleton
  and Lamb, 1986; Lee, 1989; DeGrand et al., 1990; Schumann and Wendling, 1990;
  Betancor-Gothe and Grassl, 1993; Bakan et al., 1994; Mannstein et al., 1999).
</p>
<p>Data for the frequency of contrails are available from surface-based observations
  at 19 locations across the continental United States of America for every hour
  during 1993-94 (Minnis et al., 1997). The data indicate that contrail frequency
  peaks around February/March and is at a minimum during July. Annual mean persistent
  contrail frequency (not the cover) for the 19 sites was 12%. When related to
  fuel use and extended to the remainder of the country, mean annual contrail
  frequency for the United States of America is estimated at 9% (Minnis et al.,
  1997). The relationship between fuel consumption and contrail frequency from
  this data set is shown in <a href="038.htm#img314">Figure 3-14</a>. The correlation
  implies that contrail coverage is limited mainly by the number of aircraft flights,
  not by atmospheric conditions at cruise altitudes. Pilots flying over the former
  Soviet Union have reported that contrails occur most frequently in winter and
  spring and less often during summer (Mazin, 1996). Sky photographs taken from
  1986 to 1996 over Salt Lake City, Utah, reveal a seasonal cycle in contrail
  frequency, with a maximum in fall and winter and a minimum in July (Sassen,
  1997). These data are similar to observations from a site 64 km north (Minnis
  et al., 1997) of Salt Lake City. Sassen (1997) and Minnis et al. (1997) found
  that contrails occur with cirrus in approximately 80% of observations. The coincidence
  of cirrus and contrails suggests that cloud-free supersaturated regions are
  usually interspersed with areas in which natural clouds have actually formed.

<p>From an analysis of AVHRR infrared images taken over the northeast Atlantic
  and Europe, a mean contrail cover of 0.5% was derived for 1979-81 and 1989-92
  (Bakan et al., 1994). A distinct seasonal cycle was found, with a southward
  displacement of the maximum cover during winter. Maximum coverage (~2%) occurred
  during summer, centered along the North Atlantic air routes. Using AVHRR channel
  4 and 5 differences and a pattern-recognition algorithm to differentiate line-shaped
  clouds from fuzzy cirrus clouds, the contrail cover-defined as line-shaped clouds
  over mid-Europe-was systematically evaluated for all of 1996 using nearly all
  noon passages of the NOAA-14 satellite (see <a href="038.htm#img315">Figure 3-15</a>)
  (Mannstein et al., 1999). Contrails are not uniformly distributed; instead,
  they lie along air traffic corridors and accumulate near upper air route crossings.
  As with observations over the United States and the former Soviet Union, maximum
  coverage occurred during winter and spring. At noon on average over the year,
  line-shaped contrails cover about 0.5% of the area of the mid-European region
  shown in this figure. This coverage represents the lower bound for the actual
  contrail cover because the algorithm cannot identify non-line-shaped contrails.
  Contrail coverage at night over Europe is one-third of the noon-time contrail
  cover (Mannstein et al., 1999). </p>
<p>Contrails often occur in clusters within regions that are cold and humid enough
  to allow persistent contrails to form. Contrail clusters observed in satellite
  data indicate that these air masses cover 10 to 20% of the area over mid-Europe
  (Mannstein et al., 1999) and parts of the United States of America (Carleton
  and Lamb, 1986; Travis and Changnon, 1997), consistent with the fraction of
  air masses expected to be ice-supersaturated at cruise altitudes. Hence, as
  air traffic increases in these regions, persistent contrail coverage is also
  expected to increase, possibly up to a limit of 10-20%.
</p>
<p>Estimates of global coverage by air masses that are sufficiently cold and humid
  for persistent contrails can be obtained using meteorological analysis data
  of temperature and humidity, a model to estimate the frequency of ice-saturation
  in each grid cell as a function of the analyzed relative humidity, and the Schmidt-Appleman
  criterion (depending on h; see <a href="035.htm#3241">Section 3.2.4.1</a>) for
  contrail formation conditions. Using 11 years of meteorological data from the
  European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF), the cover of suitable
  air masses is found to be largest in the upper troposphere, especially in the
  tropics (global mean value of 16%) (Sausen et al., 1998). This coverage is similar
  in size to the area covered by clusters of contrails in satellite data and the
  frequency of ice-supersaturated air masses observed along commercial aircraft
  routes (Gierens et al., 1999). The expected contrail cover is then computed
  from the product of the air mass coverage and the fuel consumption rate in the
  same region, with the latter chosen as one of several possible measures of air
  traffic. The product is scaled to give a 0.5% mean contrail cover in the European/Atlantic
  region (30�W to 30�E, 35 to 75�N) as considered by Bakan et al. (1994). The
  resulting contrail cover (see <a href="038.htm#img316">Figure 3-16</a>) for 1992
  fuel emissions and h = 0.3 is 0.087% (about 0.1%) in the global mean, with a
  local maximum of 5% over the eastern United States of America. The computed
  contrail coverage over southeastern Asia is only slightly smaller than that
  over Europe and North America. Although air traffic is much less extensive over
  southeastern Asia, this high contrail coverage may result because this region
  more often has ice-supersaturated air. However, the predicted contrail coverage
  over North America and southeastern Asia has not yet been verified by observations.
  Predicted regional differences are sensitive to the representation of the number
  of aircraft in operation. For example, in some regions, a large fuel consumption
  density is caused by a few large aircraft (Gierens et al., 1998). Studies have
  not been performed to evaluate the accuracy of humidity values provided by meteorological
  data. The results depend linearly on scaling by the cover observed in the reference
  region, as provided here by Bakan et al. (1994). Other data imply global cover
  values between 0.02 and 0.1% (Gierens et al., 1998). A value larger than 0.1%
  (possibly 0.2%) cannot be excluded because the analysis uses only thermodynamic
  contrail formation conditions and the scaling is based solely on observed line-shaped
  contrail cover. </p>
<h3><b><i><a name="344"></a>3.4.4. Contrail Properties</i></b></h3>
<p>The relatively small particles present in newly formed contrails serve to distinguish
  contrail radiative properties from those of most natural cirrus (Grassl, 1970;
  Ackerman et al., 1998; see also <a href="040.htm">Section 3.6</a>). Measurements
  of contrail particles with impactors and optical probes (see also <a href="035.htm#324">Section
  3.2.4</a> and <a href="034.htm#tab31">Table 3-1</a>) reveal a wide variety of
  size, shape, and spectral size distributions. The results depend on plume age,
  ambient humidity, ambient aerosol, and other parameters. At a plume age of 30
  to 70 s, ice particles have been found to form a single-mode log-normal size
  distribution with a volume-equivalent radius in the range of 0.02 to 10 �m,
  a mean radius of about 2 �m, and maximum dimension of 22 �m. Particle shapes
  are mainly hexagonal plates, along with columns and triangles. The axial ratios
  of the columns were found to be less than 2, and the shapes of the crystals
  were already established for particles of about 1-�m radius (Goodman et al.,
  1998). Contrail particle sizes increase with time in humid air. Ice particles
  observed in 2-min-old contrails typically have radii of 2 to 5 �m with shapes
  that are almost spherical, indicating frozen solution droplets (Schr�der et
  al., 1998b). On the other hand, some contrail particles strongly polarize light,
  indicating non-spherical shapes (Freudenthaler et al., 1996; Sassen, 1997).
  After 10 min to 1 h, contrail particle size distributions may range from 32
  to 100 �m or even 75 �m to 2 mm (Knollenberg, 1972; Strauss et al., 1997). </p>
<p>Particle properties within a contrail core differ from those at the edges of
  the contrail. In the center of contrails, insufficient water vapor is available
  to allow the large number of ice particles to grow to large crystals. At the
  edges, ice supersaturation is greater, thereby sometimes allowing ice crystals
  to form up to 300 �m in diameter (Heymsfield et al., 1998a). The larger particles
  have various shapes, with the largest being bullet rosettes (Lawson et al.,
  1998). Such large particles are within the natural variability of cirrus particle
  sizes. As a consequence, old dispersed contrails appear to have particle sizes
  similar to those in surrounding cirrus (Duda et al., 1998; Minnis et al., 1998a).
</p>
<p>Aircraft create a large number of new ice crystals that grow from ambient water
  vapor. As a contrail spreads, some evidence suggests that ice crystals are neither
  lost nor created in significant numbers. In one remote-sensing study, the total
  number of particles (about 2.6 x 10<sup>9</sup> ice crystals per cm of contrail length)
  in a contrail was found to remain constant as the contrail dispersed and the
  particle concentration (particles per unit volume) dropped (Spinhirne et al.,
  1998). In situ measurements (Schr�der et al., 1998b) reveal 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> particles
  larger than 4.5-mm diameter formed per cm of contrail length. In contrast, changes
  in particle number will occur when some particles eventually sediment out of
  the contrail and new particles are nucleated as a result of air motions induced
  by the contrail. The ice water content of new contrails increases with time
  to exceed the amount of water emitted by the aircraft by more than two orders
  of magnitude. However, the water content per unit volume remained approximately
  constant in the case observed by Spinhirne et al. (1998). The optical depth
  of contrails remains nearly constant during the first hour despite horizontal
  spreading (J�ger et al., 1998). </p>
<h3><b><i><a name="345"></a>3.4.5. Impact of Aircraft Exhaust on Cirrus Clouds
  and Related Properties</i></b></h3>
<p>Aircraft may perturb natural cirrus through the addition of water vapor, soot,
  and sulfate particles and by inducing vertical motions and turbulent mixing
  (Gierens and Str�m, 1998). Observations of cirrus coverage in certain regions
  have found perturbations from anthropogenic aerosol (Str�m et al., 1997). Persistent
  contrails are often associated with or embedded in natural cirrus (Minnis et
  al., 1997; Sassen, 1997). Such in-cloud contrails may be formed slightly above
  the Schmidt-Appleman temperature threshold because ambient ice particles that
  enter the engine inlet increase the humidity in the exhaust plume (Jensen et
  al., 1998a; K�rcher et al., 1998a). Some evidence associates in-cloud contrails
  with regions of enhanced absorbing material and enhanced ice crystal number
  densities (Str�m and Ohlsson, 1998). The presence of HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> may increase the hygroscopic
  growth of supercooled cloud droplets (Laaksonen et al., 1997), and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> dissolved
  in sulfate solution droplets may change their freezing behavior. The importance
  of such perturbations has not been quantified.

<p>Soot particles originating from aircraft exhaust may act as freezing nuclei.
  In an atmosphere with few freezing nuclei, this perturbation could lead to an
  expansion of cirrus cover, a change in average particle size, and related changes
  in cloud surface area and optical depth (Jensen and Toon, 1997)-hence have consequences
  for radiative forcing (see <a href="040.htm#365">Section 3.6.5</a>). For aircraft
  to alter cirrus properties, exhaust particles would need to be more efficient
  or more abundant than ice nuclei currently existing in the atmosphere. If the
  predominant particle that freezes to form ice contains sulfate, aircraft soot
  could serve as important ice nuclei because sulfate particles require a relatively
  high supersaturation before freezing occurs. Over the central United States
  of America, however, as many as 0.1 to 0.2 cm<sup>-3</sup> freezing nuclei (effective at
  -35�C) have been found in the upper troposphere (DeMott et al., 1998), indicating
  that the number of freezing nuclei is not always small. Some observations show
  that aircraft exhaust does not contain large numbers of ice nuclei active at
  temperatures above -35�C (Rogers et al., 1998). Soot and metals were found to
  be significant, but not dominant, components of ice nuclei in contrails (Chen
  et al., 1998; Petzold et al., 1998; Twohy and Gandrud, 1998). </p>
<p>Aircraft measurements in and near clouds have indicated the presence of light-absorbing
  material contained inside ice crystals. The distribution pattern and the amount
  of measured absorbers suggest that the material is related to aircraft soot
  (Str�m and Ohlsson, 1998) (<a href="038.htm#img317">Figure 3-17</a>). For the same
  abundance of aerosol particles, clouds perturbed by absorbing material contained
  1.6 to 2.8 times more ice crystals than unperturbed portions of clouds. These
  observations suggest that aircraft-produced particles enhance cloud ice particle
  concentrations, although they have not revealed the physical mechanism involved.
  Specifically, exhaust soot particles may have been involved in ice crystal formation
  within the cirrus or formed contrail ice particles within the exhaust plume
  before being incorporated into the cloud. These observations are roughly consistent
  with calculations of a cirrus cloud forming in a region of recent exhaust trails
  (Jensen and Toon, 1997).
</p>
<p>Cirrus clouds may also be perturbed by enhanced sulfate aerosol. Small sulfate
  particles (e.g., 10-nm radius) are unlikely to be ice nuclei or cloud condensation
  nuclei. Larger particles would be more efficient. Such large particles may originate
  as ambient sulfate particles enlarged by growth from sulfur gases emitted by
  aircraft or by processing of liquid exhaust particles in short-lived contrails
  (see <a href="034.htm">Section 3.2</a>). Because ice nucleation processes tend
  to be self-limiting (Jensen and Toon, 1994), cirrus cloud properties would change
  only slightly if the number of sulfate particles increased while the size distribution
  and composition of ambient sulfate particles remained constant. On the other
  hand, large sulfate particles-such as those induced by the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic
  cloud-could lead to a significant increase in the number of ice crystals, optical
  depth, and radiative forcing of cirrus clouds (Jensen and Toon, 1992). Cloud
  modifications would require a large increase in the number of larger sulfate
  particles; such modifications would occur primarily in cirrus that were very
  cold (T < -50�C) and weakly forced by slow updrafts. Lidar observations of a
  cirrus cloud embedded in aerosol from the Mt. Pinatubo eruption show significantly
  higher than normal ice crystal concentrations (Sassen, 1992; Sassen et al.,
  1995). Satellite data analyzed after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption suggest that
  the volcanic aerosol reduced the occurrence of cirrus clouds with high extinction
  coefficients, increased the occurrence of clouds with low extinction coefficients,
  and increased extinction in optically thick clouds (Minnis et al., 1993; Wang
  et al., 1995). Hence, some available models and data suggest that aircraft exhaust
  could play a significant role in modifying the properties of clouds. However,
  the magnitude and nature of these modifications are not well understood. </p>

<p>Sedimentation of large particles in persistent contrails may remove water vapor
  from the upper troposphere, possibly reducing radiative heating by water vapor,
  and cause seeding of lower level clouds (Murcray, 1970; Knollenberg, 1972).
  Sedimentation of ice crystals, which has been observed occasionally (Konrad
  and Howard, 1974; Schumann, 1994; Heymsfield et al., 1998a), becomes important
  only in strongly supersaturated air (Hauf and Alheit, 1997) when large ice crystals
  form and have the potential to fall through lower-lying saturated air in which
  they will not evaporate readily. Because no attempts have been made to quantify
  the precipitation rate from contrails, the significance of this precipitation
  has not been assessed.</p>
