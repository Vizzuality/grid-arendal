<h2><b>4.4. Uncertainties in Model Results </b></h2>
<p>It is not clear how we can properly represent the true uncertainty associated
  with atmospheric effects; such an assessment represents an unattainable goal
  for the present. The model results presented in this chapter have been calculated
  using state-of-the-art atmospheric models from many groups. As a result of their
  different treatment of physical, dynamic, and chemical processes, there is a
  considerable range in their computed impacts. We have attempted to bracket the
  results by using a combination of the range of different results between models
  for the same scenarios and results from sensitivity tests of parameters judged
  to be important. </p>
<p>Many factors contribute to the uncertainty of model calculations for present
  and future descriptions of the atmosphere. These factors include deficiencies
  in the representation of transport processes (e.g., stratosphere/troposphere
  exchange and tropical and polar region barriers); model resolution; the dimensionality
  of the models (i.e., 2-D or 3-D); deficiencies in chemical and physiochemical
  processes; and the state of the future atmosphere. Many of these issues cannot
  be considered in isolation. For example, the spatial resolution of a model may
  determine how well it is able to capture the meteorological details required
  for an accurate simulation of the dispersion of plumes and the formation of
  PSCs. Furthermore, as noted earlier, the models we used for our calculations
  can be considered to be of two types: Those that have been formulated for a
  detailed simulation of the troposphere, and those designed to simulate primarily
  stratospheric processes. This use of two model types to attack a problem whose
  resolution requires the ability to model the troposphere and stratosphere adds
  further uncertainty to the results obtained. </p>
<p>It should also be noted that sensitivity studies from the 3-D tropospheric
  subsonic scenarios are often based on runs performed with a single model, thus
  should be viewed with caution. In other cases, such as that of sensitivity to
  NMHC chemistry, the different models had different sensitivities. </p>
<p>As discussed in <a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>, time constants for transport in the stratosphere
  can be very long, and models must be run for many years to calculate the background
  state and the perturbed atmosphere. In addition, the parameter space that must
  be probed for unbuilt HSCTs is much more extensive than for the characteristics
  of the subsonic fleet. The use of 2-D models allowed for a more detailed analysis
  of the parameter space associated with supersonic aircraft. However, the results
  from these runs are also limited by the 2-D nature of the models. </p>
<p>Some of the uncertainty issues noted above have been discussed from a somewhat
  different perspective in <a href="028.htm">Section 2.3</a>. In addition, several
  international assessment reports (Stolarski et al., 1995; WMO, 1995; Fabian
  and K�rcher,1997; Friedl, 1997; Brasseur et al., 1998) have addressed some of
  these uncertainties. In the following paragraphs, we describe some features
  related to model uncertainty that we have identified in this study. </p>
<h3><b><i><a name="441"></a>4.4.1. Uncertainties in Calculated Effects of Subsonic
  Aircraft Emissions </i></b></h3>
<h4><i><a name="4411"></a>4.4.1.1. Transport and the Fuel Study </i></h4>
<p>One means of assessing model uncertainties from transport is by comparing concentrations
  of inert or passive tracers with specified input and removal rates. For such
  species, it may be assumed that differences in distribution are solely a result
  of transport and its representation because chemistry plays no role. The results
  of such an experiment are described in <a href="036.htm#3341">Section 3.3.4.1</a>
  and Danilin et al. (1998). Because the emissions in this experiment are based
  on fuel use by subsonic aircraft, the experiment tests the transport characteristics
  of models in the UT and LS. Mixing ratios of fuel tracer are roughly 10-100
  ng/g between 8-16 km north of 30�N. Southern Hemisphere stratospheric concentrations
  are about a factor of 4 less than in the Northern Hemisphere. Although the general
  pattern of the test tracer is qualitatively similar among various models, the
  maximum tracer concentrations deviate by a factor of 10 among the models. Some
  of this difference may be an artifact of low vertical resolution, but the results
  clearly point to uncertainties that need to be resolved. </p>
<p>One of the major problems with model tranport is that stratospheric-tropospheric
  exchange (STE) is poorly represented in current models of any dimension. Current
  theory has air entering the stratosphere through the tropics and returning at
  mid-latitudes. However, recent measurements of chemical tracers such as H<span class="subscript">2</span>O
  and CO, diagnostic of tropospheric air, suggest that the lowest few kilometers
  of the lowermost stratosphere can be impacted by air being convected from the
  lower troposphere (Dessler et al., 1995; Lelieveld et al., 1997). These areas
  require more evaluation. </p>
<p>One of the problems that has not been addressed in these studies is sub-grid-scale
  parameterizations. This issue includes dispersion of material in the plume to
  the regional scale, which is typical of the grid resolution of most models.
  In addition, exchange of air between the troposphere and the stratosphere takes
  place on a variety of scales, and only the larger scales are modeled with any
  reliability. </p>
<p>Thus, it is very difficult to assess inherent uncertainties in model results
  that are products of limitations in modeling transport. Nevertheless, as explained
  in <a href="052.htm">Section 4.5</a>, we attempt such an assessment by comparing
  the different models in a semi-quantitative manner. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4412"></a>4.4.1.2. Chemistry </i></h4>
<p>The chemistry of VOCs (NMHC, acetone) and the transport of peroxides to the
  upper troposphere have recently been found to play important roles in the HO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  radical balance (Singh et al., 1995; Folkins et al., 1997; Jaegl� et al., 1997;
  McKeen et al., 1997; Prather and Jacob, 1997; Wennberg et al., 1998). An additional
  source of HO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the UT could significantly influence O<span class="subscript">3</span> production efficiencies.
  This uncertainty would propagate through the 3-D tropospheric models because
  there are large differences in chemistry modules. To some degree, this effect
  has been explored and the results tabulated in <a href="048.htm#tab46">Table
  4-6</a>. Further model studies clearly are needed. </p>
<p>NO<span class="subscript">x</span> plays a key role in the O<span class="subscript">3</span> generation process in the UT and LS, and there
  are significant differences in predicted NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels among the models. However,
  because of the limited number of observations and the large temporal and spatial
  variations of these observations, it is difficult to validate modeled upper
  tropospheric and lower stratospheric concentrations (see <a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>).</p>
<p>Although the process studies referred to in <a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a> point to a strong dependence
  of O<span class="subscript">3</span> production on NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels, the standard simulations and sensitivity studies
  presented in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> show a limited impact of nonlinear chemistry on O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbations.
  For example, all of the 3-D CTM standard simulations for 1992, 2015, and 2050
  calculated a nearly linear increase in O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbation as a result of increases
  in aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions despite increases in background NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels. As noted
  above, there are large differences among models in their calculation of O<span class="subscript">3</span> transport
  and chemistry between the UT and LS, and it is in this region where O<span class="subscript">3</span> has a
  significant contribution to the infrared heating budget (Wang and Sze, 1980;
  Lacis et al., 1990; Fortuin et al., 1995). </p>
<p>Given the limitations of the tropospheric models to estimate O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbations
  in the tropopause region-in particular perturbations in the LS-a comparison
  of fractions of O<span class="subscript">3</span> change that occur in the troposphere is made. Considering
  different characteristics of each model, meteorological and numerical, the estimated
  tropopause height may differ considerably among them. In addition, the "real"
  tropopause height may vary locally by at least 2 km, depending on the season
  and the local meteorology. Thus, we have applied the following crude estimate
  of tropopause height to all models: 8 km poleward of 65�, 10 km between 65�
  and 50�, 12 km between 50� and 35�, 14 km between 35� and 25�, and 16 km in
  the tropics. These figures are consistent with average tropopause heights used
  by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (Fishman et al., 1990). </p>
<p>The fraction of O<span class="subscript">3</span> change from 1992 aircraft emissions that occurs in the troposphere
  varies between 0.65 and 0.75, with an uncertainty of about 15%. The fraction
  calculated for the stratospheric 2-D AER model was 0.81. The ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM model
  predicts the lowest tropospheric fraction (0.65). As noted above, the assumption
  is that this fraction of 0.65 represents minimum O<span class="subscript">3</span> generation in the troposphere
  from subsonic emissions by the current (1992) fleet. </p>
<p>However, the model simulations just discussed did not include the generation
  of sulfate by aircraft, and consideration of this factor may alter the picture
  somewhat. Because no 3-D tropospheric models were available to investigate sensitivity
  to sulfate emissions, an attempt to assess their significance was made using
  the AER and UNIVAQ 2-D microphysical models. Although these models are limited
  in their applicability to the UT, they do yield results that suggest further
  work is required to evaluate the significance of calculated O<span class="subscript">3</span> generation by
  subsonics. </p>
<p>Aircraft sulfur experiments have been carried out for 2015 using an EI(SO<span class="subscript">2</span>)=0.4
  for a fleet flying nominally at 10 km. It was further assumed that the SO<span class="subscript">2</span> emitted
  was converted in the plume to 10 nm (radius) particles with 50 and 100% efficiency.
  <a href="050.htm#tab414a">Table 4-14a</a> summarizes the model predictions of
  aerosol increases at middle northern latitudes for the 10-14 km height range.
</p>
<p>The importance of transport is clear: Although new particles are formed at
  about 11-km altitude, the models yield significant changes of SAD up to about
  14 km, thus creating a potentially important link between subsonic emissions
  and stratospheric O<span class="subscript">3</span>. This conclusion is consistent with the results of the
  1992 tracer experiment (see <a href="036.htm#334">Section 3.3.4</a>), in which
  2-D and 3-D models calculate the largest fuel tracer mixing ratios in an altitude
  layer from about 10 to 14 km. </p>
<p><a href="050.htm#tab414b">Table 4-14b</a> gives concomitant O<span class="subscript">3</span> column changes.
  The AER and UNIVAQ models show that the O<span class="subscript">3</span> column increase from atmospheric
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> aircraft perturbation tends to be mitigated when sulfate SAD is changed
  by the aircraft. This result is mainly a consequence of more heterogeneous reactions
  on sulfate particles, leading to the release of ClO, BrO, and HO<span class="subscript">2</span> in this layer.
  However, the reduction in magnitude of O<span class="subscript">3</span> generation is much stronger in the
  UNIVAQ model as compared to the AER model. Clearly, this issue requires more
  study. </p>
<h3><i><b><a name="442"></a>4.4.2. Uncertainties in Calculated Effects of Supersonic
  Aircraft Emissions </b></i></h3>
<h4><i><a name="4421"></a>4.4.2.1. Transport </i></h4>
<p>Clearly, an important uncertainty in the evaluation of the effects of aircraft
  is the representation of transport in the 2-D and 3-D models used to simulate
  the effect of supersonic aircraft emissions. The research community recognizes
  this general limitation, and an ongoing exercise (Models and Measurements II,
  Park et al., 1999) should help to quantify some of the transport differences
  among the models. Models and Measurements II is an activity supported by NASA
  to test models through detailed comparisons with measurements. It is a follow-on
  of the Models and Measurements workshop completed several years ago (Prather
  and Remsberg, 1993). The results of Models and Measurements II should be available
  by the end of 1999. </p>
<p>New analysis techniques of models relying on "age of air" (Hall and Plumb,
  1994), sulfur hexafluoride (SF<span class="subscript">6</span>) (Elkins et al., 1996), and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> (Boering et
  al., 1996) measurements allow more detailed comparisons to test the transport
  of models. Most models tend to underestimate the observed "age of air;" therefore,
  the derived delta NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O for these models is probably a lower limit. As
  a result, the models will tend to underestimate O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion from supersonic
  aircraft. </p>
<p>Another measure of transport uncertainty is illustrated by significant differences
  in mixing ratios calculated for NOy accumulation in the stratosphere from supersonic
  aircraft emissions (<a href="049.htm#img46a">Figure 4-6a</a>). This uncertainty
  reflects differences in lower stratospheric residence times for the different
  models. </p>
<p>The atmosphere undergoes large variations from one year to the next. These
  interannual variations will drive a different transport of constituents, which
  will lead to significant differences in the impact of supersonic emissions on
  O<span class="subscript">3</span>. Jackman et al. (1991) simulated very different aircraft-induced O<span class="subscript">3</span> changes
  using separate dynamical fields; a slow (rapid) circulation simulation caused
  larger (smaller) O<span class="subscript">3</span> decreases. The SLIMCAT model has been used with a yearly
  varying transport recently and has computed total O<span class="subscript">3</span> decreases that vary significantly
  in the same months of different years. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4422"></a>4.4.2.2. Model Resolution/Dimensionality </i></h4>
<p>As noted above, the formidable computational resources required to conduct
  long-term multiyear 3-D stratospheric simulations for assessment has made it
  necessary to use 2-D models. Although the 2-D models have very sophisticated
  formulations for gas phase chemical processes, their meridianal resolution is
  typically 5� (550 km) or coarser in latitude and 1 km or more in altitude throughout
  the stratosphere. Intrinsically, this resolution limits their ability to treat
  LS transport processes. In addition, because atmospheric species are treated
  in a zonally averaged manner, effects such as PSC formation and chemical processing
  must be parameterized more crudely than in 3-D models. </p>
<p>Issues of spatial resolution and dimensionality of models are very pertinent
  to the treatment of PSCs and the processing of polar air. 2-D models do not
  adequately parameterize the zonal variation of temperature, thus the formation
  of PSCs. Even 3-D models do not capture the different horizontal temperature
  scales within the Arctic stratosphere. For example, even though synoptic conditions
  would suggest otherwise, low temperatures and PSCs may be induced by wave flow
  over mountains (Carslaw et al., 1998); this mesoscale phenomenon is not directly
  addressed by most models to date. This uncertainty in assessing impacts from
  aircraft could be an even more important issue in trying to assess future impacts
  when the stratosphere may be cooler because of enhanced CO<span class="subscript">2</span> mixing ratios (Shindell
  et al., 1998). </p>
<p>Yet another, quite different, resolution problem that may limit our ability
  to model chemical effects is that of filamentation processes, whereby winter
  polar air consists of long but narrow (< 5 km) filaments of gas in which species
  densities are different. O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion studies performed at very high horizontal
  resolution for the winter Arctic (Edouard et al., 1996) have underlined the
  uncertainty in calculating chemical loss of O<span class="subscript">3</span> from differing resolutions. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4423"></a>4.4.2.3. Stratospheric Chemistry </i></h4>
<p>Current models do quite well in reproducing the general behavior of O<span class="subscript">3</span> in the
  stratosphere. Nevertheless, as is evident from the discussion in <a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a> and
  above, problems remain. For example, there appears to be a discrepancy of about
  30% between calculated and measured O<span class="subscript">3</span> levels near the stratopause (Osterman
  et al., 1997). In addition, related problems emerge with a careful comparison
  with observations, such as the ratio of active to reservoir species for Cl<span class="subscript">y</span>
  (Michelsen et al., 1996). These problems may be alleviated by the inclusion
  of new HCl and hydrogen bromide (HBr) formation rates (see <a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>). </p>

<p>The models generally assume the same set of reaction rate constants and photodissociation
  cross-sections based on the DeMore et al. (1997) recommendations. Comparisons
  of results for a subset of models (AER, CSIRO, GSFC, LARC, LLNL, SLIMCAT) in
  a benchmark at photostationary steady-state (Stolarski et al., 1995) indicate
  that the differences were less than 1% for CSIRO and LLNL; a few percent for
  AER, LARC, and SLIMCAT; and a few percent up to 10-15% for GSFC. Similar results
  are not available for the other models, and it is not possible to conclude that
  the chemical solvers in all models are equivalent throughout the atmosphere;
  however, the choice of chemical solver does not appear to be a major uncertainty
  in our ability to perform assessment calculations. </p>
<p>Uncertainty in photochemical rate constants has been propagated through a 2-D
  assessment model using a Monte Carlo approach for an EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=15 HSCT fleet with
  background aerosols (SA0) and no sulfur emissions (Stolarski et al., 1995).
  The effect of uncertainties in gas-phase reaction rate coefficients on perturbutions
  of O<span class="subscript">3</span> are estimated to yield an uncertainty on the order of 1% (1-sigma) in
  calculated Northern Hemisphere O<span class="subscript">3</span> column perturbations. However, these experiments
  did not include uncertainties in photolytic cross-sections and heterogeneous
  processes, which could enhance the uncertainty significantly. Recently, box
  model sensitivity-uncertainty calculations for O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion from supersonic
  aircraft emissions, again with EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=15 and background aerosols, were performed
  at the most perturbed locale using localized outputs from a 2-D model (Dubey
  et al., 1997). Guided by these sensitivities, 2-D model integrations were completed
  with nine targeted input parameters altered to 1/3 of their 1-sigma uncertainties
  to put error bounds on the predicted O<span class="subscript">3</span> change. Results indicated local O<span class="subscript">3</span> loss
  of 1.5 � 3% in regions of large NO<span class="subscript">x</span> injections. We note, however, that these
  sensitivity studies were all carried out with relatively high EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) values
  [three times the EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) taken as standard for the current assessment], which
  is likely to further modify the intrinsic sensitivities of the models to perturbations.

<p>Uncertainty in our knowledge of the present atmosphere affects our ability
  to calculate formation of and the chemical processing associated with PSCs.
  This uncertainty is particularly acute in the Arctic winter because early springtime
  temperatures are higher in the Arctic than in the Antarctic, and are quite close
  to the threshold temperature for the formation of PSCs. Thus, a temperature
  error of a few degrees can make a substantial difference in calculating the
  extent of processing. Objectively analyzed temperatures-those based on measurements
  and often processed for use in weather forecast models-are frequently used in
  3-D CTMs to estimate chemical processing. However, it appears that UKMO and
  ECMWF objectively analyzed temperatures may be systematically too high by 1
  to 2 K in winter (Knudsen, 1996; Pullen and Jones, 1997); this uncertainty will
  impact our understanding of the microphysics associated with heterogeneous chemistry.
</p>
<p>The question of processing of reservoir species such as HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> and HCl on PSCs
  remains uncertain, and hysteresis effects may be important. That is, the formation
  of PSCs by condensation and removal by evaporation may not be describable in
  terms of reversible processes, and the temperature history of the air parcel
  may be important. Currently, most models avoid this complication. Conversion
  of reservoir species may occur as a result of dissolution of HCl in sulfate,
  forming a ternary solution, or may occur on frozen surfaces of water or NAT
  ice surfaces. The sensitivity of O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion to the details of these processes
  appears to be less important for Antarctic conditions; many models yield relatively
  complete conversion of reservoir species induced by cold vortex temperatures.
  However, as noted above, this effect could be more important for the relatively
  warmer Arctic vortex. This uncertainty associated with chemistry, combined with
  the dynamic uncertainty, suggests that modeling of the propagation of PSC processing
  effects onto global scales is very uncertain. </p>
<p>Solomon et al. (1997) pointed out that the presence of high cirrus clouds near
  the tropical tropopause could decrease O<span class="subscript">3</span> in the stratosphere by activating
  chlorine constituents. Emissions of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> from supersonic and subsonic
  aircraft have the potential to increase the occurrence of high cirrus clouds
  (see <a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>). This effect is not evaluated by the model simulations performed
  in this chapter. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4425"></a>4.4.2.5. Underlying Subsonic Fleet </i></h4>
<p>In all scenarios for 2050 except two (S11a and S12a), the subsonic fleet was
  as defined for the 2015 scenarios. For scenarios S11a and S12a, a more realistic
  representation of the subsonic fleet in 2050 was used. For example, scenario
  S11a was compared with the IS92a predicted subsonic fleet scenario F (scenario
  Fa1 in <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a>), and scenario S12a was compared with the high-demand subsonic
  fleet scenario G (scenario Fe1 in <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a>). As for all other supersonic scenarios,
  S11a and S12a contain subsonic aircraft emissions as well as HSCT aircraft emissions;
  the combination accounts for the same passenger demand as in subsonic-only scenarios
  F and G for 2050. Scenarios S9d, S11a, and S12a have similar supersonic components,
  but the subsonic components in the perturbed and the base runs (D9, F, and G,
  respectively) are very different. There are only minor differences in predicted
  total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> change for a particular model in either hemisphere related to
  assumptions about the underlying subsonic fleet size (<a href="049.htm#tab412">Table
  4-12</a>). Therefore, the size of the underlying subsonic fleet is computed
  to have only a minor impact on predicted O<span class="subscript">3</span> changes from the projected supersonic
  fleet. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4426"></a>4.4.2.6. Future Atmosphere </i></h4>
<p>An additional uncertainty associated with the calculation of future aircraft
  impact is related to the increasing trend of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
  and the impact on stratospheric temperatures and transport. For example, a CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  mixing ratio of about 500 ppmv is the recommendation of WMO (1992) for CO<span class="subscript">2</span> in
  the year 2050-about 1.5 times the 1980 value. The change in radiative forcing
  as a result of greenhouse gas increases will affect stratospheric temperature
  and circulation (see Chapter 12 of WMO, 1999, and references therein); this
  effect has not been taken into consideration here. The likely cooler future
  stratosphere would delay the recovery of polar O<span class="subscript">3</span> in Arctic and Antarctic regions,
  which could affect the future impact of aircraft. </p>
<p>One study of the effect of increasing CO<span class="subscript">2</span> amounts (Pitari and Visconti, 1994)
  showed that stratospheric cooling mitigated the increase in NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. However, this
  study did not take into consideration the increase in H<span class="subscript">2</span>O associated with aircraft;
  therefore, more complete studies need to be done with a wide range of models.
</p>
<p>Another major uncertainty regarding knowledge of the future stratosphere is
  that associated with source gases, in particular H<span class="subscript">2</span>O. This uncertainty is underscored
  by our lack of understanding of current H<span class="subscript">2</span>O trends. Global trends in stratospheric
  humidity over the period 1992 to 1996 inclusive have been presented recently
  by Evans et al. (1998) using Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) measurements
  of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and CH<span class="subscript">4</span> from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) instrument. The
  authors find that the combined budget of 2CH<span class="subscript">4</span> + H<span class="subscript">2</span>O is approximately constant
  with altitude and is increasing with a global mean value of 61 ppbv yr<sup>-1</sup>. A
  more local view of water vapor increase in the lower stratosphere was presented
  by Oltmans and Hofmann (1995) over the period 1981 to 1994. They found a maximum
  rate of increase in the 18-20 km layer of 32 ppbv yr<sup>-1</sup>. The rate of increase
  of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O observed in the stratosphere is greater than the increase in tropospheric
  CH<span class="subscript">4</span>. One suggestion is that the increase could be accounted for by a change
  in tropopause temperature of a few tenths of a degree, and the most recent changes
  might be a result of changes in the dynamics of the tropics induced by heating
  of Mt. Pinatubo aerosols (Schauffer and Daniel, 1994). This uncertainty highlights
  the delicate balance between chemistry and climate. </p>

<p>The chemistry of soot has been discussed in <a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>; the conclusion is that
  it does not react with O<span class="subscript">3</span> in a catalytic manner. That is, O<span class="subscript">3</span> can be destroyed
  by soot, but the soot is consumed in the process (see <a href="024.htm#2131">Section
  2.1.3.1</a>). However, soot particles may act as condensation nuclei for sulfate
  or other species, modifying cirrus clouds in the UT or LS, and locally they
  may be important in the destruction of O<span class="subscript">3</span> (Bekki, 1997; Lary et al., 1997).
  Thus, we present some estimates of soot densities and SADs for future scenarios
  to complement those estimated for the current (1992) subsonic fleet already
  given in <a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a>. There are large uncertainties with regard to the sources
  and distribution of soot particles. Emissions from aircraft are particularly
  uncertain. Few global modeling studies are available for these aerosols (see
  <a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a> for details). Emissions of soot by aircraft [EI(soot)=0.03-0.4 g/kg]
  (Friedl, 1997) have been studied by Bekki (1997), who used the Cambridge 2-D
  aerosol/soot model for past and present air traffic, and more recently by Rahmes
  et al. (1998) for current and future aircraft fleets. </p>
<p>For the results presented herein, the aircraft-generated soot distribution
  was approximated by scaling the distribution of passive tracer calculated according
  to aircraft fuel burn (see also <a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a>). A number of models have calculated
  this distribution for 2015 and 2050 (1992 distribution is shown in <a href="036.htm#tab34">Table
  3-4</a>); all show the largest mass mixing ratio at about 12-km altitude and
  poleward of 40�N. The results for subsonic aircraft in the years 2015 and 2050
  (IS92 Scenario 1) are shown in <a href="051.htm#tab415a">Table 4-15</a>. For
  2015, some results are also included for subsonic and HSCT aircraft together.
  These numbers represent an upper limit because sedimentation is neglected. Soot
  particles could also be lost by coagulation with larger sulfate aerosols and
  by condensation of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>-H<span class="subscript">2</span>O on the particle surface. </p>
<p>Taking 2.0 pptm as a reference mixing ratio for subsonic aircraft soot in 2015
  at 12 km and 50�N, an approximate SAD of 0.03 �m<sup>2</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> is obtained when assuming
  (as a first approximation) spherical particles of 2 g cm<sup>-3</sup> density (Pueschel
  et al., 1997) and a bimodal size distribution peaked at 20 and 100 nm radii
  with equal contribution in mass. If the particles are not assumed to be spherical
  but can be represented by fractal geometry, their SAD could lead to an enhancement
  by a factor of about 4 (Jennings et al., 1999) over the spherical case. This
  seems more appropriate than 30, as suggested by Blake and Kato (1995). DeMore
  et al. (1997) recommend reaction efficiencies for O<span class="subscript">3</span> decomposition between 0.003
  and 1 x 10<sup>-5</sup>, with one O<span class="subscript">2</span> molecule produced for each O<span class="subscript">3</span> reacting. As noted above,
  this O<span class="subscript">3</span> decomposition is not catalytic because reaction sites on soot are rendered
  inactive when they are used or when the particle becomes coated with H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>.
