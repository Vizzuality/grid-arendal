<p>IPCC (1996b), OECD (1989), and others have examined other potential economic
  instruments for mitigating aviation environmental effects: </p>
<p>. Fuel taxes and charges (levies) to promote fuel efficiency and reduce demand
  <br>
  . Emissions charges aimed at encouraging adoption of lower emitting technology
  <br>
  . Emissions trading to encourage emissions reductions through market forces
  <br>
  . Ticket taxes or charges <br>
  . Levies on empty aircraft seats to promote improvement in seat load factor
  <br>
  . Levies on excessive traffic per destination, destinations served, or type
  of equipment serving a destination <br>
  . Levies on route length to reduce the number of flights that are less than
  a minimum distance <br>
  . Subsidies or rebates to act as an incentive for polluters to change their
  behavior, such as grants, soft loans, tax allowances or differentiation, and
  instruments similar to effluent, product, or administrative charges. </p>
<p>Some of these measures are currently being considered by ICAO. Although examples
  of some of these and other measures exist in some countries, however, they have
  not been actively pursued by governments or ICAO. </p>
<h4><a name="10431"></a>10.4.3.1. Environmental Levies </h4>
<p>Aviation is subject to various taxes and charges (grouped for convenience and
  referred to as levies in this report), most of which are related to the recovery
  of infrastructure costs and the provision of services. These levies consist
  primarily of landing charges imposed by airports on air service providers, route
  facility charges imposed by providers of air navigation services on operators,
  and passenger and cargo taxes based on the value of the ticket or waybill. The
  term environmental levy or emissions-related levy refers to charges and taxes.
  There are, however, relatively few examples of environmental charges or taxes
  related to emissions. The primary goal of such charges is to ensure that the
  external costs of the service provided are fully reflected in the charges paid.
  By internalizing external costs, environmental levies have the potential to
  reduce aircraft emissions by providing further incentives to develop and purchase
  low-emission technology, improve operational efficiency, and reduce demand via
  higher fares. </p>
<p>ICAO makes a distinction between charges and taxes and, because charges are
  based on cost of service and the revenue is retained by the aviation sector,
  has expressed a strong preference for the former. It regards charges as levies
  to defray the costs of providing facilities and services for civil aviation
  and taxes as levies to raise government revenues, which are applied to non-aviation
  purposes. In applying this principle to environmental levies, the ICAO Council
  Resolution on Environmental Charges and Taxes recommends that, where introduced,
  levies should be guided by the following principles: </p>
<p>. There should be no fiscal aims behind the charges. <br>
  . Charges should be related to costs. <br>
  . Charges should not discriminate against air transport compared with other
  modes of transport. </p>
<p>The Resolution was adopted in December 1996, and endorsed by the 32<sup>nd</sup> ICAO
  Assembly (ICAO, 1998b). </p>
<p>One of the recommendations at the CAEP/4 meeting in April 1998 (ICAO, 1998a)
  was to "identify and evaluate the potential role of market-based options, including
  emissions charges, fuel taxes, carbon offset, and emissions trading regimes."
  This recommendation was approved by the ICAO Council, and the 32nd ICAO Assembly
  subsequently requested that a conclusion be reached on guidance to be given
  to states on emissions-related levies in time for the next ICAO Assembly in
  2001 (ICAO, 1998b). In its future work, CAEP will identify a range of market-based
  options, assess their limitations, identify their environmental effects, consider
  the application of revenues that might be accrued, and consider implementation
  mechanisms that might be employed. </p>
<p>ICAO does not, however, cover member states' tax policies for domestic aviation.
  The United States, for example, applies a fuel tax on domestic air carriers
  and general aviation aircraft; the receipts are held in the Airport and Airways
  Trust Fund and are prohibited by law from being used for non-aviation purposes.
  Similarly, some domestic aviation fuel is already taxed in Europe, where the
  status of the mandatory exemption of international aviation fuel from taxation
  has been under discussion for some time. In March 1997, the European Commission
  proposed in a draft directive that this aviation fuel tax exemption should remain
  until the international legal situation permits imposition of such a tax (European
  Commission, 1997). </p>
<p>Zurich Airport has added an emissions surcharge to the landing fee based on
  engine certification information contained in the ICAO Engine Exhaust Emissions
  Data Bank (ICAO, 1995b; Zurich Airport Authority, 1997). This charge was intended
  primarily to provide an incentive to encourage operators to use their lowest
  emissions aircraft into Zurich and to accelerate the use of best available technology.
  Revenues are used to finance emissions reduction measures at the airport. A
  similar emissions-related charge was applied at 10 Swedish airports beginning
  1 January 1998. These charges are revenue neutral and do not affect consumer
  demand. They do, however, provide an incentive to airlines to purchase and operate
  aircraft with lower engine emissions. These charges are considered consistent
  with ICAO principles. </p>
<p>Concern has been expressed that uncoordinated introduction of emissions charges
  at the national, sub-federal, or regional level or by airports will have international
  repercussions because they are discriminatory to some aircraft that comply with
  internationally recognized standards, and the original intention of the NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  certification standards was not to set local environmental restrictions, including
  levies. One implementation issue that would need to be addressed with fuel taxation
  is that international taxation of aviation fuel is currently precluded by provisions
  contained in many bilateral air service agreements between countries, the main
  legal framework underlying the operation of international civil aviation. Three
  studies assessing the economic and environmental impact of environmental levies
  are considered below. A 1997 OECD study (OECD, 1997a) found that although fuel
  price increases have had little impact on the demand for air travel, the rate
  of energy intensity reduction in civil aviation has been very responsive to
  fuel price. On the basis of historical data, the study concluded that, when
  implemented on an international basis, a meaningful rise in fuel prices introduced
  at a moderate rate each year could have a large impact on increasing the rate
  of energy intensity reduction. The study considered fuel charge options equivalent
  to 2, 10, and 50% of the price of aviation fuel, and considered the use of revenues
  to reduce the general level of taxation and to fund research and development
  within the aviation industry. </p>
<p>Although the OECD study did not attempt to identify a direct relationship between
  fuel price and energy intensity over the scenario period, it did suggest that
  cumulative fuel levies resulting from an increase in the price of aviation fuel
  of up to 5% per year could result in at least a 30% reduction in aviation energy
  use in 2020 relative to the reference scenario. However, if charges were not
  applied at a uniform global level, the study concluded that the increase in
  fuel price would lead to a distortion of competition and a weakening of incentives
  to develop and adopt energy-efficient aircraft. It further concluded that a
  fuel charge was unlikely to have any substantial long-term effect on air traffic
  growth, particularly if it were introduced gradually. </p>
<p>In its report to CAEP/4, the Focal Point on Charges (FPC) (ICAO, 1998a) considered
  the potential economic and environmental impacts of various environmental levies.
  It concluded that, among the options studied, the most effective options for
  addressing global emissions were a fuel levy and en route charges. The report
  showed that any resulting cost increases passed on to consumers would result
  in a reduction in emissions. This result would occur primarily through lower
  traffic demand, but airline and manufacturer supply-side responses also would
  be stimulated, with limited impact on airline operating results. The portion
  of the fuel price increase not passed on to customers would be borne by the
  airlines, affecting their profitability, cash flow, and retained earnings-which,
  in turn, could affect the ability of airlines to purchase more environmentally
  beneficial equipment. </p>
<p> The report considered alternative applications of the proceeds of environmental
  levies. The revenue-neutral approach did not cause a problem with the redistribution
  of revenues, but the environmental benefits were found to be limited. Although
  general taxes are feasible on implementation grounds, they raise serious problems
  of equity and acceptability. A prevention cost approach using revenues to fund
  future technology improvement was regarded as better than general taxation in
  reducing total emissions; however, rechanneling of revenues to the aviation
  industry would give rise to administrative complexities and raises equity problems
  and risks of distortion of competition. </p>
<p>A feasibility study by the Centre for Energy Conservation and Environmental
  Technology (CE) (Bleijenberg and Wit, 1998) considered the feasibility of introducing
  an environmental charge on civil aviation in Europe. Using a scenario-based
  approach and an aviation fuel price to include the environmental cost at 125%
  of the cost of the fuel, the study found that the rate of growth in aviation
  emissions in Europe would be approximately halved. A charge based on calculated
  emissions was found to have similar environmental effectiveness to a fuel charge,
  but the former had smaller economic distortions and fewer legal obstacles than
  the latter. The study found that an emissions charge in European airspace would
  have little impact on competition between domestic and non-European carriers.
  A revenue-neutral emissions charge was judged to be the most feasible option,
  with high environmental effectiveness and relatively few economic distortions.
</p>
<p>Several comparisons may be made of the main features of these three studies.
  In the FPC study, most of the benefits arose from a reduction in the growth
  of demand, whereas in the OECD and CE studies, the supply-side influence was
  predominant. Partly as a consequence of the strong supply-side effect, the OECD
  and CE studies estimated a larger reduction in total emissions than did the
  FPC report. Both the FPC and the OECD considered options to rechannel revenues
  for technology improvement within the aviation sector. The FPC study found greater
  distortions to competition between airlines arising from a European emissions
  or fuel charge than the CE study. </p>
<p>Two areas require further study. The first is the applicability of environmental
  levies to the circumstances of countries other than those in OECD and countries
  in transition; the other is how revenues generated from a levy would be used.
</p>
<h4><a name="10432"></a>10.4.3.2. Other Market Approaches </h4>
<p>Emissions trading of greenhouse gases has been adopted as part of the Kyoto
  Protocol as a potential means of achieving reductions in these gases at the
  lowest possible costs. Emissions trading allows market forces to operate to
  achieve the lowest possible costs of achieving an environmental goal. It can
  provide companies such as airlines with the flexibility to reduce their own
  emissions or to purchase equivalent reductions from others, if doing so would
  be less expensive. It gives firms the incentive to employ innovative technologies
  and reduce emissions beyond what any standard would require. </p>
<p>Markets play a central role in the efficient exchange of commodities, shares,
  bonds, and financial instruments. Existing international markets have well-established
  practices for contracting, delivery, and settlement that could be applicable
  to emissions trading. Emissions trading differs considerably from the more traditional
  standards approach that, for example, has been used by ICAO. Under that approach,
  a specific emissions limit has been established, and each aircraft must meet
  the standard. Under emissions trading, an overall level of emissions production
  is set, and firms are allowed flexibility to jointly meet that standard. Firms
  that can achieve low-cost reductions to meet their requirements have an incentive
  to reduce below the required levels and sell their excess emissions reductions
  to other firms. Firms facing higher control costs can purchase these reductions
  to comply with their requirements at lower costs than by using alternative means.
</p>
<p>A credible system of monitoring and verifying emissions reductions that allows
  for trading with minimal transaction costs would be needed to achieve the cost
  savings potential of these mechanisms. As in other areas of environmental policy,
  an emissions trading regime would be likely to meet environmental objectives
  at the lowest cost because it sets overall environmental goals, provides geographic
  and temporal flexibility, would allow for flexible trading across industry boundaries,
  and would offer incentives for meeting the goals (Dudek and Goffman, 1997).
</p>
<p>Among OECD countries, the efficacy of emissions trading in meeting the objectives
  of the Kyoto Protocol has been compared to direct market and regulatory intervention.
  Some observers have suggested emissions trading is difficult to enforce and
  raises potentially difficult liability issues. Others have expressed concern
  about the possibility that companies with excess reductions will not sell them,
  thus creating a barrier to new entrants in the market. However, successful allowance-based
  SO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions trading among competitive electric power generation companies
  in the United States favored emissions trading over other options. Monitoring,
  reporting, verification, and certification systems need to be explicitly defined
  and developed. </p>
<p>Emissions trading has been used in the United States in the control of SO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  emissions responsible for acid rain. Flexibility in this program has resulted
  in pollution permit prices of about $100 per ton, compared to estimated prices
  before the program was implemented on the order of $250-400 per ton (Council
  of Economic Advisors, 1998a). In addition, modeling indicates that programs
  using tradable permits could enable more cost-effective control of local and
  global atmospheric pollutants than other regulatory options under consideration
  (IPCC, 1996d; GAO, 1997). Emissions trading has been incorporated in the Montreal
  Protocol, the international treaty that limited ozone-depleting substances.
  Under that treaty, restrictions were placed on several specific chlorofluorocarbon
  (CFC) compounds as a group, instead of separate restrictions on each compound.
  Countries could permit firms to trade among CFCs, reducing those that cost the
  least first. In addition, in a separate provision, production permits were allowed
  to be traded across nations to allow for a lower cost, more orderly phaseout
  of manufacturing facilities (Montreal Protocol, 1987). </p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, 1998b) contains emissions trading provisions that
  provide substantial flexibility for nations to reduce their costs of meeting
  agreed emissions goals. As with the Montreal Protocol, targets for greenhouse
  gases were not set for individual compounds but rather as a single comprehensive
  goal combining six major greenhouse gases (sources and sinks). Nations can adopt
  plans that minimize the costs of meeting this target based on the relative costs
  of controls among these different categories of greenhouse gases. The Kyoto
  Protocol provisions allow developed nations to trade emissions on a project-by-project
  basis (Article 6) and through an emissions trading system (Article 17). A clean
  development mechanism (Article 12) was established to allow developed countries
  to support and get emissions credit for actions in conjunction with developing
  countries that reduce emissions in those countries. </p>
<p>Relevant principles, modalities, rules, guidelines for emissions trading, and
  the role of governments are being discussed by the Conference of the Parties
  to the UNFCCC and its subsidiary bodies, with the goal of reaching agreement
  before the end of the year 2000. A credible system of monitoring and verifying
  reductions that allows for trading with minimum transaction costs will be needed
  to achieve the cost savings potential of these mechanisms. International aviation
  emissions are not covered by the emissions-related targets in the Kyoto Protocol.
  The prerequisite for emissions trading is adoption of emissions reduction targets
  or caps. In principle, the aviation sector could be included in the emissions
  targets agreed in the Kyoto protocol, but the feasibility of applying an emissions
  trading regime depends on establishing a method to allocate international aviation
  bunker fuels. Emissions trading would likely be available across all industries,
  allowing progress in emissions reduction at the lowest cost. High-cost compliance
  industries with limited compliance options could purchase rights from lower-cost
  producers of other commodities. </p>
<p>An analysis of the potential for reducing the costs of meeting the Kyoto targets
  from these flexible, market-based approaches was conducted within the United
  States. This study suggests that reductions in permit prices on the order of
  70-90% were possible because of these provisions (Council of Economic Advisors,
  1998b).</p>
