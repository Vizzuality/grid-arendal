<h3>6.3.4. Radiative Forcing for CH<font size="-1">4</font></h3>
<p>Methane is a long-lived, well-mixed greenhouse gas. It has an atmospheric lifetime
  of about 9 years. The tropospheric chemical models used to evaluate the impact
  of the subsonic fleet found unanimously that CH<font size="-2">4</font> lifetime
  was reduced by aircraft emissions (see <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>). This
  instantaneous change (-1.3% in 1992, -2.6% in 2015, and -3.9% in 2050 for scenario
  FSEGa (tech1)) needs to be increased further by a factor of 1.4 to include the
  feedback of CH<font size="-2">4</font> concentrations on lifetime (Prather,
  1994; IPCC, 1996). It is then applied to the IS92a CH<font size="-2">4</font>
  abundance to calculate the reduction in CH<font size="-2">4</font> concentration
  that can be attributed to aircraft. The CH<font size="-2">4</font> perturbation
  is assumed to be instantaneous; in reality, however, it takes a couple of decades
  to appear and will lag the O<font size="-2">3</font> perturbation. For the purposes
  of interpolating between RF points in <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table 6-1</a>,
  we assume that the CH<font size="-2">4</font> perturbation, like the O<font size="-2">3</font>
  perturbation, is proportional to NO<font size="-2">x</font> emissions. </p>
<h3>6.3.5. Radiative Forcing for H<font size="-1">2</font>O<a name="635"></a></h3>
<p>Water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas that is highly variable in the troposphere,
  with a short average residence time controlled by the hydrological cycle. In
  the stratosphere, the slow turnover of air and extreme dryness make precipitation
  and clouds a rare phenomena, leading to smoothly varying concentrations ranging
  from 3 to 6 ppmv as CH<font size="-2">4</font> is oxidized to H<font size="-2">2</font>O
  (Dessler et al., 1994; Harries et al., 1996). The contribution of aircraft to
  atmospheric H<font size="-2">2</font>O is directly from the H in the fuel (assumed
  to be 14% by mass). Most of the subsonic fleet's fuel is burned in the troposphere,
  where this additional source of water is swamped by the hydrological cycle.
  A smaller fraction is released in the stratosphere, where longer residence times
  may lead to greater accumulation. However, because flight routes are close to
  the tropopause and reach at most into the lowermost stratosphere, this effluent
  is rapidly returned to the troposphere with little expected accumulation (Holton
  et al., 1995; see also <a href="036.htm#334">Section 3.3.4</a>). </p>
<p>Although the uncertainty of predicting the current subsonic RF for water vapor
  is large-a factor of 3-the absolute number in 1992 is estimated to be sufficiently
  small, +0.0015 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>, making this factor a minor uncertainty
  in subsonic climate forcing. It is assumed that this value scales linearly with
  fuel use (see <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table 6-1</a>). This value is consistent
  with earlier studies: Schumann (1994) and Fortuin et al. (1995) estimated that
  present air traffic enhances background H<font size="-2">2</font>O by less than
  1.5% for regions most frequently used by aircraft; likewise, Ponater et al.
  (1996) and Rind et al. (1996) used GCM studies to conclude that the direct radiative
  effect on the climate of water vapor emissions from 1992 air traffic is negligibly
  small. </p>
<p>The projected HSCT fleet, however, would cruise at 20-km altitude and build
  up much greater H<font size="-2">2</font>O enhancements in the stratosphere.
  The stratospheric models described in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> predicted
  excess stratospheric water vapor from an HSCT fleet of 500 aircraft (designated
  HSCT(500) in <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table 6-1</a>). This perturbation is difficult
  to calculate, and the likely (2/3 probability) range includes a factor of 2
  higher and lower. Furthermore, RF modeling of this stratospheric H<font size="-2">2</font>O
  perturbation adds further uncertainty, as indicated in <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table
  6-1</a>. All results suggest that this effect is the dominant HSCT climate impact,
  with RF equal to +0.05 (0.017 to 0.15) W m<font size="-1">-2</font> for 500
  aircraft, increasing to +0.10 (0.03 to 0.30) W m<font size="-1">-2</font> for
  a mature fleet of 1,000 aircraft (HSCT(1000)). Although it takes several years
  to accumulate this excess stratospheric water vapor, it is assumed that this
  RF is instantaneously proportional to the HSCT fleet size. </p>
<p>In a GCM study, Rind and Lonergan (1995) looked for climate change caused by
  H<font size="-2">2</font>O accumulation from a fleet of 500 HSCTs. They found
  no statistically significant change in surface temperature. Their result is
  consistent with this assessment and with water vapor as the dominant HSCT climate
  impact because the magnitude of this radiative forcing from the fleet, +0.05
  W m<font size="-1">-2</font>, would induce a mean global warming that would
  be difficult to detect above natural climate variability. </p>
