<h3><b>2.1.2. Effects of Aircraft Gaseous Emissions</b></h3>
<p>As discussed above, the concentration of ozone is determined by transport from 
  other locations and by local production and loss. Production and destruction 
  rates of ozone are strongly influenced by the concentration of the free-radical 
  catalysts NO and NO<span class="subscript">2</span> (NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) 
  and OH and HO<span class="subscript">2</span> (HO<span class="subscript">x</span>). 
  In the presence of NO, ozone is produced as a by-product when CO, CH<span class="subscript">4</span>, 
  and other hydrocarbons are oxidized by OH. NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  also influences the destruction rate of ozone directly as a catalyst (in the 
  stratosphere) and indirectly as a result of reactions that couple NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  to other reactive species such as the odd hydrogen radicals, OH and HO<span class="subscript">2</span>, 
  and, in the stratosphere, the halogen free radicals chlorine monox<span class="subscript"></span>ide 
  (ClO) and bromine monox<span class="subscript"></span>ide (BrO). </p>
<h4><i><a name="2121"></a>2.1.2.1. Production of Ozone</i></h4>
<p>The production of ozone in the stratosphere is dominated by the photolysis
  of oxygen (O<span class="subscript">2</span>) by sunlight. Because radiation with short wavelengths (less than
  242 nm) is screened out by O<span class="subscript">2</span> and ozone in the upper atmosphere, this process
  is not very important in the troposphere. In the region where commercial aircraft
  fly, ozone (O<span class="subscript">3</span>) is produced mainly from the oxidation of CO: </p>

</table>
<p>The rates of these reactions depend directly on the concentrations of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and
  HO<span class="subscript">x</span>. Increases in the concentration of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> from aircraft generally will increase
  the rate of ozone production by speeding the oxidation of CO and CH<span class="subscript">4</span>. Other
  aircraft emissions, such as H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, CO, and NMHCs, are not expected to significantly
  affect this background chemistry because natural sources of these compounds
  far exceed the perturbation from aviation (Friedl, 1997; Brasseur et al., 1998).
  Within the plume, however, the production of particulate and subsequent contrail
  and cloud formation may influence NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and HO<span class="subscript">x</span> and therefore the production rate
  of ozone (see <a href="024.htm">Section 2.1.3</a>). </p>
<h4><i><a name="2122"></a>2.1.2.2. Sources and Sinks of NO<span class="subscript">x</span></i></h4>
<p>Aircraft emissions are one of many sources of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the troposphere and the
  stratosphere. In the stratosphere, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is produced primarily from the oxidation
  of nitrous oxide (N<span class="subscript">2</span>O). N<span class="subscript">2</span>O is produced by numerous sources, and its concentration
  has been increasing at a rate of 0.5-0.8 ppbv yr<sup>-1</sup> (IPCC, 1996). As a result
  of this source, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> concentrations in the LS are quite large, increasing from
  about 100 pptv at the tropopause to as much as 3000 pptv at an altitude of 20
  km. Aircraft exhaust provides an additional source of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, but there is no evidence
  that this source has appreciably altered the concentration of stratospheric
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. </p>
<p>The primary sources of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the troposphere are fossil fuel combustion, biomass
  burning, soil emissions, lightning, transport from the stratosphere, ammonia
  oxidation, and aircraft exhaust. The largest source is fossil fuel combustion;
  95% of its emissions are in the Northern Hemisphere (Lee et al., 1997). Biomass
  burning occurs primarily in the continental tropics. Soil emissions come from
  microbial denitrification and nitrification processes, the rate depends on soil
  type and temperature, ecosystem type, water content, and several other variables
  (Matthews, 1983; Müller, 1992; Williams et al., 1992; Yienger and Levy, 1995).
  The contribution of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> produced by lightning is very uncertain because it is
  extremely difficult to measure directly. The distribution around thunderstorms
  is highly variable because NO production differs for cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground
  strikes. Oxidation of ammonia (NH<span class="subscript">3</span>) of NO occurs at the surface, mainly in the
  tropics. Although the sources of NH<span class="subscript">3</span> are fairly well known, the rates of reactions
  that result in NO are uncertain (Lee et al., 1997), and, under some conditions,
  ammonia oxidation can be a sink for NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. </p>
<p>Various studies have estimated the emission of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> from these sources (Müller,
  1992; Atherton et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1997). Additionally, estimates for
  individual sources have been produced: fossil fuel combustion (Dignon, 1992;
  Benkovitz et al., 1996); biomass burning (Crutzen and Andreae, 1990; Müller,
  1992; Atherton, 1995); soil emissions (Matthews, 1983; Williams et al., 1992;
  Yienger and Levy, 1995); lightning (Price and Rind, 1992; Levy et al., 1996;
  Ridley et al., 1996); aircraft exhaust (Wuebbles et al., 1993; Metwally, 1995;
  Baughcum et al., 1996; Gardner et al., 1997); and transport from the stratosphere
  (Kasibhatla et al., 1991; Wang et al., 1998a). </p>
<p>Compilations and evaluations of emission rates (Friedl, 1997; Lee et al., 1997)
  have emphasized that the contribution from lightning remains highly uncertain.
  The relative impact of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> produced from aviation is critically dependent on
  the strength of this source. Despite this uncertainty, it is likely that averaged
  over the globe, the lightning source of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the UT is 2 to 8 times as large
  as the aircraft source. Although lightning, aircraft emissions, and transport
  of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> from the boundary layer during deep convection clearly provide significant
  sources of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> to the UT, the contribution of each in determining the total
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> concentration is not well understood. </p>
<p><i>In situ</i> observations have been made in the UT to help identify and quantify 
  sources of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. The concentration of NO measured 
  in these field campaigns is extremely variable. Based on a number of in situ 
  aircraft missions, however, typical NO concentrations in the UT are in the range 
  50-200 pptv (Emmons et al., 1997; Schlager et al., 1997; Tremmel et al., 1998). 
  Because of the large variability in the atmosphere, these relatively sparse 
  observations cannot quantitatively define the strengths of the various NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  sources in the UT. Recent aircraft campaigns-for example, SONEX, POLINAT-2, 
  NOX<span class="subscript"></span>AR-should, however, provide important constraints 
  on the role of aircraft in perturbing NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. For 
  example, a full year of observations of NO in the UT and lowermost stratosphere 
  obtained onboard a commercial airplane have demonstrated the importance of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  sources associated with convection (Brunner et al., 1998).</p>
<p>The NO<span class="subscript">x</span> species belong to a family of chemicals collectively called reactive
  nitrogen (NOy). This family includes species that are coupled to NO<span class="subscript">x</span> on time
  scales of one day to several weeks, such as HNO<span class="subscript">4</span>, nitrogen pentoxide (N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span>),
  nitric acid (HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>), and, in the troposphere, peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN). The
  primary form of reactive nitrogen emitted into the atmosphere is NO. Once NO
  is in the atmosphere, it undergoes rapid interconversion with NO<span class="subscript">2</span> and then slower
  conversion to other reactive nitrogen species such as HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>. </p>

<p>Reactions occurring on aerosol surfaces also play an important role in the
  chemical partitioning of NOy. It is well-established that NO<span class="subscript">x</span> concentrations
  are reduced and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> concentrations are enhanced as a result of heterogeneous
  chemistry on aerosol surfaces. It is also possible that reactions occurring
  on soot may play the opposite role, converting HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> back to NO<span class="subscript">x</span> (<a href="024.htm">Section
  2.1.3</a>).</p>
<p>Observations of NOy species have demonstrated that our understanding of the
  sources of NOy and the partitioning of NOy in the stratosphere is relatively
  good (within ± 30%) (Rinsland et al., 1996; Gao et al., 1997). Photochemical
  models of the partitioning and distribution of NOy in the UT, however, have
  typically demonstrated poor agreement with observations. Because the reactions
  that convert NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, PAN, and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> occur on time scales similar to transport, it
  is not clear whether the observed differences are caused by errors in the chemical
  description or by dynamic influences that are not captured in the models (Prather
  and Jacob, 1997).</p>
<h4><i><a name="2123"></a>2.1.2.3. Sources and Sinks of OH and HO<span class="subscript">2</span></i></h4>
<p>HO<span class="subscript">x</span> is produced in the UT and LS via a number of processes. One important primary
  source of OH is the reaction of water vapor with O(1D) produced in the photolysis
  of ozone: <br>

<p>Additional sources of OH and HO<span class="subscript">2</span> in the troposphere include the photolysis
  of acetone (Singh et al., 1995), peroxides (Chatfield and Crutzen, 1984), and
  formaldehyde. In the stratosphere, the photolysis of HOBr and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> produced
  in reactions occurring on aerosols may also be important HO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources (Hanson
  et al., 1996). The existence of important primary HO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources in addition to
  reactions 6a and 7 has been demonstrated by recent measurements of OH and HO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  in the UT and LS (McKeen et al., 1997; Jaeglé et al., 1997, 1998; Brune et al.,
  1998; Wennberg et al., 1998). These primary sources of OH can be further amplified
  during the oxidation of CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and other hydrocarbons. </p>
<p>OH is chemically coupled to HO<span class="subscript">2</span> by reactions such as 1-3 that convert these
  species on time scales of seconds to minutes. Removal of HO<span class="subscript">x</span> (leading to the

<p>NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and HO<span class="subscript">x</span> are therefore linked by a number of important reactions (3,9,10-12);

<p>In all models, the net ozone production rate (production rate - loss rate)
  increases rapidly with NO<span class="subscript">x</span> until a maximum is reached. At NO<span class="subscript">x</span> concentrations
  larger than 500 pptv, the net rate of ozone production is expected to decrease
  with increasing NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. Depending on the background concentration of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, additions
  of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> from aviation can increase or decrease the net ozone production rate.
  Thus, the background concentration of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> determines both the magnitude and
  the sign of the perturbation. Field measurements of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the middle and upper
  troposphere typically have found NO<span class="subscript">x</span> to be 50-200 pptv (Emmons et al., 1997;
  Schlager et al., 1997; Tremmel et al., 1998). At these concentrations, the rate
  of net ozone production increases almost linearly with NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. </p>
<p><a href="023.htm#img21">Figure 2-1</a> also illustrates that the rate of ozone
  production depends critically on HO<span class="subscript">x</span> source strength. In this figure, the calculation
  in Case 0 assumes that the primary source of HO<span class="subscript">x</span> is limited to the reaction
  of O1D with H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and CH<span class="subscript">4</span>. This assumption is made in many (but not all) of the
  chemical transport models used to assess the effect of aviation in <a href="026.htm#221">Section
  2.2.1</a> and <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>. Case 1 includes an additional source of HO<span class="subscript">x</span> from acetone
  photolysis (Singh et al., 1995), assuming acetone is present at a concentration
  roughly consistent with recent measurements in the UT (Singh et al., 1995; Arnold
  et al., 1997). Case 2 assumes that in addition to acetone, peroxides and formaldehyde
  are transported to the UT by convection (Chatfield and Crutzen, 1984; Jaeglé
  et al., 1997). It is clear from observations of HO<span class="subscript">x</span> obtained from the DC-8 (Brune
  et al., 1998) and the ER-2 (Wennberg et al., 1998) that HO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources in addition
  to O1D + H<span class="subscript">2</span>O are needed to explain measured concentrations of OH and HO<span class="subscript">2</span>. The
  effect of these HO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources is most pronounced in UT air when the water vapor
  mixing ratio is less than 100 ppmv. At median NO<span class="subscript">x</span> concentrations observed during
  these campaigns-50-100 pptv, typical of the UT (Brunner et al., 1998)-the net
  ozone production rate is calculated to be 1-2 ppbv per day. This rate is significantly
  faster than would be calculated assuming only the simple O1D HO<span class="subscript">x</span> chemistry.
</p>
<p>The sensitivity of the net ozone production rate to assumptions about the sources
  of odd hydrogen is high and remains an area of significant uncertainty. The
  budget of acetone, for example, is poorly understood, and relatively few measurements

<h4><i><a name="2125"></a>2.1.2.5. The Response of Stratospheric Ozone Destruction
  to NO<span class="subscript">x</span></i></h4>
<p>The concentration of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> also influences the rate at which ozone is destroyed
  in the atmosphere, particularly in the stratosphere and in the lower troposphere.
  In the stratosphere, because of the abundance of ozone and lower pressures,
  the concentration of atomic oxygen is sufficiently large that NO<span class="subscript">x</span> can catalytically
  destroy ozone: <br>

<p>Reactions of the HO<span class="subscript">x</span> family also destroy ozone. In particular, reaction 15
  leads to significant ozone loss in the LS and in the troposphere. Reaction 3
  is in competition with reaction 15, so the rate of ozone loss by HO<span class="subscript">x</span> decreases
  with increasing NO. </p>

<p>Finally, ozone loss by halogen chemistry is important in the stratosphere.
  During winter, particularly in polar regions, it can dominate all other chemical
  destruction mechanisms. As with HO<span class="subscript">x</span> chemistry, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> interferes with this chemistry
  by binding to the reactive chlorine radical ClO: <br>

<p>As a result of these coupling reactions, changes in the concentration of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  can lead to increased or decreased rates of stratospheric ozone destruction.
  When NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is low-as it is in most of the LS during winter, fall, and spring-most
  of the ozone loss occurs through HO<span class="subscript">x</span> and halogen chemistry. Under these conditions,
  enhancements of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> will decrease ozone destruction. On the other hand, at higher
  altitudes and during summer, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>-catalyzed ozone loss (reactions 16-17) can
  dominate the removal of lower stratospheric ozone, so enhancements in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> will
  speed ozone loss (Brühl et al., 1998). These effects have been demonstrated
  by direct measurements of free radicals in the stratosphere (Wennberg et al.,
  1994; Jucks et al., 1997). </p>
<p>This chemistry is illustrated in <a href="023.htm#img22">Figure 2-2</a>. A 
  calculation is shown for typical mid-latitude springtime conditions. This entire 
  profile is within the stratosphere, where catalytic ozone loss competes with 
  and can exceed photochemical production. The left panel shows the fraction of 
  ozone destroyed during the month of March as a result of catalysis by NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  (squares), halogens (circles), and HO<span class="subscript">x</span> (crosses). 
  For this latitude and season, the loss is dominated by halogen and hydrogen 
  oxides below 20 km, whereas above 25 km, nitrogen oxides are most important. 
  To illustrate how changes in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> perturb this 
  chemistry, the right panel shows the effect of a uniform 20% increase in the 
  concentration of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. In regions where NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  is high, ozone destruction increases. On the other hand, the opposite occurs 
  in the LS because the increased NO<span class="subscript">x</span> decreases 
  the loss of ozone by hydrogen and halogen radicals. Thus, as with the production 
  rate of ozone in the troposphere, the response of ozone destruction with changes 
  in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is highly nonlinear. Because the photochemical 
  lifetime of ozone in the LS is very long, the concentration of ozone in this 
  region of the atmosphere is strongly influenced by transport. The change in 
  ozone loss rates illustrated in <a href="023.htm#img22">Figure 2-2</a> does 
  not translate directly into a change in ozone. For example, for a uniform 20% 
  increase in NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, enhanced loss rates at high 
  altitudes will reduce the transport of ozone to the LS. As a result, ozone concentrations 
  in the LS can decrease even when the local ozone loss rate slows. Thus, the 
  change in the ozone column with added NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is 
  very sensitive to the altitude distribution of the perturbation. The subsonic 
  aircraft fleet adds NO<span class="subscript">x</span> only to the lowermost 
  stratosphere (< 13 km), where large-scale dynamics tend to prevent advection 
  to higher altitude. As a result, injection of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  by the present fleet is thought to increase ozone in the LS. </p>
<h4><i><a name="2126"></a>2.1.2.6. Net Effects on Ozone</i></h4>
<p>If the major direct impact of aircraft on the chemistry of the UT and lowermost
  stratosphere (below approximately 16 km) is an increase in the concentration
  of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, we can say with high confidence that the ozone concentrations in this
  region will be higher than they would be in the absence of aviation. This increase
  occurs because NO speeds the catalytic oxidation rate of CO and reduces the
  destruction rate of ozone by HO<span class="subscript">x</span> and halogens (primarily in the stratosphere).
  In this context, it is important to note that the conventional troposphere-stratosphere
  boundary (i.e., the tropopause), reflecting important changes in atmospheric
  dynamics, does not coincide with the separation between net positive and negative
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span>-induced changes in ozone (see right panel of <a href="023.htm#img22">Figure
  2-2</a>). This distinction is important when considering future aviation scenarios
  that include a significant supersonic component. </p>
<p>The actual quantitative change in ozone from present aircraft operation is
  very sensitive to the meteorology of this region of the atmosphere; longer residence
  times will lead to larger NO<span class="subscript">x</span> increases and therefore higher ozone. As a result,
  only coupled chemical and dynamic models can estimate how large an increase
  is expected. To accurately predict the perturbation, these models must accurately
  describe the background NO<span class="subscript">x</span> concentration, the magnitude of the aircraft-induced
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> perturbation, the sources of HO<span class="subscript">x</span> in this region of the atmosphere, and the
  meteorology. Finally, because ozone itself is relatively long-lived in the UT
  and LS, its concentration is strongly influenced by transport (as discussed
  in <a href="022.htm#21133">Section 2.1.1.3.3</a>). The transport of ozone between
  different regions of the atmosphere significantly confounds attempts to assign
  causality to local ozone trends. As described in <a href="024.htm">Section 2.1.3</a>,
  the production of particulates and aircraft-induced formation of clouds may
  be important for ozone. Chemical processes occurring in aerosols and on ice
  clouds may lead to increases in chlorine radical abundance in the stratosphere
  and suppress NO<span class="subscript">x</span> throughout the region. </p>
