<H2>5. What are the Current and Future Impacts of Supersonic Aviation on Radiative
  Forcing and UV Radiation? </H2>
<p><i>One possibility for the future is the development of a fleet of second generation
  supersonic, high speed civil transport (HSCT) aircraft, although there is considerable
  uncertainty whether any such fleet will be developed. </i></p>
<p>These supersonic aircraft are projected to cruise at an altitude of about 19
  km, about 8 km higher than subsonic aircraft, and to emit carbon dioxide, water
  vapor, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O, and soot into the stratosphere. NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, water vapor, and SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O from
  supersonic aircraft emissions all contribute to changes in stratospheric ozone.
  The radiative forcing of civil supersonic aircraft is estimated to be about
  a factor of 5 larger than that of the displaced subsonic aircraft in the Fa1H
  scenario. The calculated radiative forcing of supersonic aircraft depends on
  the treatment of water vapor and ozone in models. This effect is difficult to
  simulate in current models and so is highly uncertain. These supersonic aircraft
  are projected to cruise at an altitude of about 19 km, about 8 km higher than
  subsonic aircraft, and to emit carbon dioxide, water vapor, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O, and soot
  into the stratosphere. NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, water vapor, and SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O from supersonic aircraft emissions
  all contribute to changes in stratospheric ozone. The radiative forcing of civil
  supersonic aircraft is estimated to be about a factor of 5 larger than that
  of the displaced subsonic aircraft in the Fa1H scenario. The calculated radiative
  forcing of supersonic aircraft depends on the treatment of water vapor and ozone
  in models. This effect is difficult to simulate in current models and so is
  highly uncertain. </p>
<p><i>By the year 2050, the combined fleet (scenario Fa1H) is projected to add
  a further 0.08 W<span class="subscript">m</span><sup>-2</sup> (42%) to the 0.19 W<span class="subscript">m</span><sup>-2</sup> radiative forcing from scenario Fa1
  (see <a href="009.htm#spmfig4">Figure 4</a>). Most of this additional forcing
  is due to accumulation of stratospheric water vapor. </i></p>
<p>The effect of introducing a civil supersonic fleet to form the combined fleet
  (Fa1H) is also to reduce stratospheric ozone and increase erythemal dose rate.
  The maximum calculated effect is at 45�N where, in July, the ozone column change
  in 2050 from the combined subsonic and supersonic fleet relative to no aircraft
  is -0.4%. The effect on the ozone column of the supersonic component by itself
  is<sup>-1</sup>.3% while the subsonic component is +0.9%. </p>
<p><i>The combined fleet would change the erythemal dose rate at 45�N in July
  by +0.3% compared to the 2050 atmosphere without aircraft. The two-thirds uncertainty
  range for the combined fleet is -1.7% to +3.3%. This may be compared to the
  projected change of -1.3% for Fa1. </i></p>
<p>Flying higher leads to larger ozone column decreases, while flying lower leads
  to smaller ozone column decreases and may even result in an ozone column increase
  for flight in the lowermost stratosphere. In addition, emissions from supersonic
  aircraft in the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere may be transported to the Southern
  Hemisphere where they cause ozone depletion. </p>

      <p><b><i>Figure 4:</i></b><i> Estimates of the globally and annually averaged
	radiative forcing from a combined fleet of subsonic and supersonic aircraft
	(in W<span class="subscript">m</span><sup>-2</sup>) due to changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols, and contrails
	in 2050 under the scenario Fa1H. In this scenario, the supersonic aircraft
	are assumed to replace part of the subsonic fleet (11%, in terms of emissions
	in scenario Fa1). The bars indicate the best estimate of forcing while
	the line associated with each bar is a two-thirds uncertainty range developed
	using the best knowledge and tools available at the present time. (The
	two-thirds uncertainty range means that there is a 67% probability that
	the true value falls within this range.) The available information on
	cirrus clouds is insufficient to determine either a best estimate or an
	uncertainty range; the dashed line indicates a range of possible best
	estimates. The estimate for total forcing does not include the effect
	of changes in cirrus cloudiness. The uncertainty estimate for the total
	radiative forcing (without additional cirrus) is calculated as the square
	root of the sums of the squares of the upper and lower ranges. The level
	of scientific understanding for the supersonic components are carbon dioxide,
	"good;" ozone, "poor;" and water vapor, "poor."&nbsp;</i></p>
