<h3>7.10.5. Other Contaminants from Supersonic Transport Engines</h3>
<p>At this stage, there is no reliable information relating specifically to the
  design of supersonic propulsion combustion systems, but there is no reason to
  believe that the degree of inefficiency should be any different from subsonic
  types. Emissions arising from this form of inefficiency are discussed in <a href="099.htm">Section
  7.5</a>. The fundamental nature of the proportion of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O emitted with conventional fuels and similar
  proportions of sulfur in available fuels suggests that these emittants will
  be produced in the same proportion to fuel usage as in the subsonic fleet, though
  at supersonic cruise they will be deposited in the stratosphere.</p>
<h3><a name="7106"></a>7.10.6. Supersonic Transport Operations</h3>
<p>Assessments of advanced supersonic aircraft concentrate on long-range over-water
  routes but do not assume that such routes will be served exclusively by supersonic
  services. It is now assumed that supersonic flight will occur only over water.
  The combination of overland routes where sonic booms are unacceptable and fitting
  into daily cycles will preserve a place for long-range subsonic services to
  meet airport curfews and provide passengers with comfortable time zone changes.
</p>
<h3><a name="7107"></a>7.10.7. Mitigation </h3>
<p>Research programs to develop low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> combustion
  systems for cruise are in place in Europe, the United States, and Japan. Two
  basic combustion concepts are being researched to produce ultra-low NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  levels at supersonic cruise conditions. These technologies-the Lean Premixed
  Prevaporized (LPP) and Rich Burn Quick Quench (RBQQ)-utilize both lean and rich
  combustion concepts such as those shown in <a href="112.htm#img742">Figure 7-42</a>
  on the previous page. As a result of low combustor operating pressures in supersonic
  transport applications, these concepts appear capable of achieving their full
  ultra-low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reduction potential while maintaining
  satisfactory durability and performance. In subsonic transports, the higher
  pressures dictate compromises in both concepts to avoid incipient flashback
  in the LPP and excessive soot production in the RBQQ. </p>
<p>The LPP concept has the likely potential of reaching the lowest levels of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>.
  The intent of premixing is to provide the combustion zone with a very lean,
  uniform fuel/air mixture that is just above the flame extinction limit. This
  approach results in a low flame temperature with enough residence time to complete
  combustion and produce low NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. Maintaining uniform
  fuel/air mixtures throughout the combustor is critical because NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  increases rapidly with any local fuel/air maldistribution. In practice, premixing
  is achieved with large numbers of small-diameter premixers. Design challenges
  with this concept include flashback or auto-ignition in the premixer, maintaining
  combustion near the lean extinction limit over the entire engine cycle operating
  span, potential fuel clogging of small-diameter fuel injectors, and complexity
  of the design because of fuel staging requirements. </p>
<p>The RBQQ concept is a derivative of an axially staged combustor and presents
  the more stable combustion configuration. The fuel/air mixture of the primary
  combustion zone is fuel-rich, thus producing low flame temperatures and low
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. In a second stage, air is quickly introduced
  to mix with the partially reacted fuel. Combustion is completed in a final stage
  at lean conditions. Most of the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is produced
  in the second stage and is a function of the uniformity and time it takes to
  dilute the reacting mixture. Design challenges with this concept include indirect
  cooling of the primary combustion zone-which may require high-temperature ceramic
  materials currently under development-and an advanced second stage that produces
  nearly instantaneous, uniform mixing of reacting gas and air. Furthermore, this
  design may require engine power-related control of air and/or fuel staging for
  practical implementation. </p>
<p>There are three active programs in which this research is being conducted:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>U.S. NASA High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT), with a goal of supersonic cruise
    NO<span class="subscript">x</span> of EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)
    = 5 </li>
  <li>Japanese Supersonic/Hypersonic Transport (HYPR), with a goal of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
    emissions below EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) = 5 at Mach 3 cruise
  </li>
  <li> EU Low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> III, to develop ultra-low NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
    combustor technology for a second-generation civil supersonic transport aircraft.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Under laboratory and component test cell conditions, very low levels of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  below EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) = 5 have been achieved at simulated
  engine operating conditions of pressure, temperature, and fuel flow with combustor
  sectors. This result gives credence to the view that EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)
  = 5 could well be achieved in engine tests scheduled after the year 2000. The
  intrinsic outputs from combustion of conventional fuels are more difficult to
  alleviate. With kerosene as a fuel, for every ton of fuel burned, 3.2 tons of
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and 1.2 tons of water are produced. </p>
