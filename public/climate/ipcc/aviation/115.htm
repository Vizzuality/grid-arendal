<h2>7.11. Special Military Considerations </h2>
<p>Although today's military and civil aircraft projects clearly respond to radically
  different national requirements, the underlying engine technology of the two
  types of aircraft has a significant degree of commonality. This situation is
  not surprising in the case of the military transport aircraft engine: In common
  with the civil engine requirements, large payloads must be carried over long
  distances at the lowest possible costs. The similarities are less obvious, however,
  with regard to combat aircraft (including fighter/bombers), which have no clear
  civil parallels. Nevertheless, many of the technical advances that have been
  developed to meet the military challenge have been adopted, in one form or another,
  in advanced civil engine applications. Indeed, an increasing number of examples
  of technical advances derived from civil engine research also are relevant to
  military engines. This two-way exchange justifies the fact that a significant
  part of today's basic research underpinning aero-engines for the future is supported
  directly or indirectly through military and civil engine sources (dual use).
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the parallel development paths and mutual objectives mentioned
  above, limits must be taken into account. In general terms, increases in the
  fuel efficiency of combat aircraft are consistent with the logistics and operational
  needs of the military because aircraft with lower fuel consumption rates would
  be able to remain engaged for longer periods of time, carry additional payload,
  reach targets from greater distances, or a combination of the three depending
  on operational requirements. They would also require less in-flight refueling.
  However, the prescribed altitude for optimum fuel efficiency may not be not
  be appropriate for military operations. Similarly, some of the restrictions
  on civil transport ground operations (e.g., engine start, taxi, and take-off
  procedures) may not be acceptable to military users. Although military procurement
  officials and operators are now acutely aware of their responsibilities with
  regard to environmental effects, operational effectiveness will always be the
  primary requirement. The following sections focus on military aero-engines-in
  particular on aspects of such engines that, for performance and/or operational
  reasons, differ from their civil counterparts in ways that might influence emissions.
  It is important to rationalize these differences in terms of their real impact
  on the environment by taking proper account of current and likely future proportions
  of the world's military aircraft fleet compared to the global total of all types
  and operations of aircraft. <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a> shows numerically
  how the environmental impact of military operations becomes a diminishing percentage
  of the total of all aircraft operations as the effects of the anticipated strong
  growth of civil transport takes effect over the next 50 years or so. Differences
  between military fuels-F-34 (NATO) and JP-8 (US)-and civil AVTUR/Jet A-1 fuel
  are covered in <a href="107.htm">Section 7.7</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="7111"></a>7.11.1. Differences Resulting from Operational and Design Features</h3>
<h4><a name="71111"></a>7.11.1.1. Combat Aircraft</h4>
<p>Aircraft used in combat operations constitute the largest proportion of the
  various types of aircraft in the military inventory. They outnumber other aircraft
  types by roughly 3 to 1; for this reason alone they justify a closer look as
  the most likely sources of divergence between the emissions of military and
  civil engines in the future. <a href="113.htm#img743">Figure 7-43</a> is extracted
  from some of the same data sources used in <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a> dealing
  with fuel usage and emissions production, in particular the ANCAT/EC2 report
  (Gardner, 1998) and the recent NASA report (Mortlock and van Alstyne, 1998).
</p>
<p>Clearly, combat aircraft will always be built to respond to quite different
  mission priorities from those applying to civil aircraft. There are, therefore,
  some differences in the design features of engines to achieve those priorities.
  Combat aircraft engines will inevitably be designed to extract maximum performance
  even though this approach entails accepting a shorter life, particularly of
  key hot-section components such as turbine blades, and shorter periods between
  maintenance than civil engines. It is also most likely that military aircraft
  will be the first to adopt the fruits of the most advanced engine technology
  in a constant drive to achieve superior performance. Thus, there will always
  be something of a technology gap between the leading military and civil engines.
  Of the principal performance requirements, the demand for higher thrust/weight
  (T/W) ratio engines will continue to be the key driver that will maintain that
  gap. This consideration inevitably means that T/W targets for new engine cycles
  will involve higher pressure ratios, higher peak temperatures, and higher fuel/air
  ratios than the current fleet. The most stringent performance targets today
  are those of Phase III of the United States' Integrated High Performance Turbine
  Engine (IHPTET) program (Hill, 1996). This multi-agency/industry initiative
  has set goals that if fully achieved, will provide important new engine technology
  levels for adoption in the next century. The principal goal of this third phase
  of a three-phase program is to achieve +100% in the T/W ratio together with
  a 40% reduction in fuel burn for a new generation of military engines. These
  targets are so ambitious that evolutionary improvements in hot-section components
  of the engine are simply not sufficient.Only radical solutions are likely to
  achieve the necessary rise in engine cycle temperatures and pressures to meet
  the T/W targets. Such engine cycle changes imply, as explained in <a href="095.htm">Section
  7.4</a>, even higher levels of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  if conventional engine technology is retained. This approach, however, is unlikely
  to be wholly acceptable because of associated rising levels of visibility of
  the brown-tinted NO<span class="subscript">2</span> component of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  gases-which, unchecked, could compromise the stealthiness of the aircraft. It
  therefore seems inevitable that significant pressure to limit NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  will remain part of the military aims attached to the IHPTET program and that
  some if not all of these aims will be relevant to environmental and operational
  performance. In this respect, therefore, the prospects of total divergence of
  priorities between military and civil engines seems small. </p>
<p>One important difference between military and civil engines is associated with
  maneuverability. Under certain conditions, for example, the military engine
  combustor must be able to accommodate the consequences of high-incidence turns
  during combat maneuvers. These maneuvers can cause unstable internal flow conditions.
  The combustor must be able to withstand the consequences of such maneuvers over
  a wide range of flight speeds and altitudes. It must also relight rapidly in
  the event of a flame-out. In today's climate, the conventional approach of increasing
  the fuel/air ratio in the combustor to ensure adequate stability is not acceptable
  unless high-power emissions can be contained using new designs. The pursuit
  of effective solutions to these important problems, taking full account of emissions,
  forms an important part of today's military research and development programs.
</p>
<p>Reheat/afterburner operations are an important requirement for combat aircraft
  engines. Although the majority of fuel used during reheat is burned at low altitude,
  the extra thrust demands associated with combat maneuvers does mean that a proportion
  of fuel (typically 8%) is burned at altitudes above 2000 km. Evidence (Seto
  and Lyon, 1994) suggests, however, that this burning within the jet pipe/exhaust
  system, where the pressure levels are much lower than in the main combustor,
  does not increase NO<span class="subscript">x</span> production, although the
  NO<span class="subscript">2</span>/NO ratio increases. Thus, it appears that
  although some operational issues can influence the design and therefore the
  emissions performance of military fighter engines, the broad technology paths
  aimed at achieving improvements diverge from those of the civil sector only
  in detail. Military programs will generally continue to lead in providing technology
  advances that "spin off" into the civil engine sector. Engine cycle advances
  that improve the thermal efficiency of the core engine will be particularly
  important in further improving the fuel efficiency of civil engines. </p>
<h4><a name="71112"></a>7.11.1.2. Military Transport</h4>
<p>Transport requirements for military operations have many parallels with civil
  operations. This concordance has led to an increasing trend toward development
  of military transport and tanker aircraft based closely on civil aircraft designs.
  The links are even closer with regard to engine development for such aircraft,
  and they are likely to remain so in the future.</p>
<h3><a name="7112"></a>7.11.2. Conclusion</h3>
<p>The principal conclusion arising from this brief review of the environmental
  aspects of military engines is that military operators are already well motivated
  to demand lower emission levels from new engines for operational as well as
  environmental reasons. Coupled with the evidence presented in <a href="130.htm">Chapter
  9</a> showing that military aircraft will, proportionately, become an even smaller
  consumer of the world's aviation fuel, a logical extension of this conclusion
  would be that military operations will have a negligible effect on global emissions
  from aircraft for the foreseeable future.</p>
