<h3>8.3.4. Ground-Based Aircraft Emissions </h3>
<p>It is not within the scope of this report to consider all of the ground-based
  activities associated with aviation. Overall emissions resulting directly from
  aircraft flights do include emissions associated with taxiing and the use of
  auxiliary power units at the gate. These emissions are considered briefly here.
</p>
<h4><a name="8341"></a>8.3.4.1. Auxiliary Power Units </h4>
<p>Auxiliary power units (APUs) are engine-driven generators contained in the
  aircraft (usually in the tail) that provide the aircraft with necessary energy
  during the time the aircraft is at the gate. Part of the generated energy is
  used for air conditioning. As an alternative, the required energy can be supplied
  by ground-based equipment that delivers electrical power at 400 Hz and preconditioned
  air to the aircraft. Herau (1992) investigated the financial and energy savings
  of such ground-based installations at Brussels Zaventum Airport's 2000 terminal
  and concluded that a significant net saving of carbon emissions could be achieved.
  At Zurich Airport in 1997, about 68,000 aircraft used terminal A and B, which
  has the facility to provide preconditioned air and 400 Hz power. Provision of
  these services achieved estimated savings of about 95% in APU fuel consumption
  and emissions. However, fuel used by APUs is only a relatively small part of
  the total fuel use of an aircraft. For example, for B737, B747, A310, MD81,
  and F100 aircraft, average APU fuel use is only 2.6, 0.8, 1.4, 2.5, and 3.5%
  of the fuel use at cruise per hour of operation, respectively (USFAA, 1982,
  1995). British Airways estimates that the amount of fuel used by an APU is less
  than 1% of the total fuel used by an aircraft. </p>
<h4><a name="8342"></a>8.3.4.2. Taxiing </h4>
<p>Although standard landing and take-off (LTO) cycles have been used for simplicity,
  there are large variations in LTO cycles from airport to airport. Although landing
  and take-off times are quite similar for similar fleet mixes, the amount of
  taxi/idle varies significantly from airport to airport (Wayson and Bowlby, 1988).
  This variance in taxi/idle time is the key factor in the variability of emissions
  from aircraft during airport operations (USFAA, 1982, 1988). Various scenarios
  have been discussed and attempted to reduce these emissions. These scenarios
  include the use of high-speed taxiways, towing of aircraft to runways (Fleuti,
  1992), last-minute start-up, improvements in engine design, restriction of certain
  aircraft types, realignment of taxiways, improvements at the gate area, and
  taxiing in with minimal engines running. </p>
<h3><a name="835"></a>8.3.5. Summary of Other Operational Factors </h3>
<p>Aviation passenger mobility efficiency is very dependent on the type of aircraft,
  the configuration, the load factor, and the distance flown. Old aircraft use
  much more fuel per passenger-km than new aircraft of similar size. The fuel
  efficiency of different aircraft is examined in <a href="088.htm">Chapter 7</a>.
  The required energy per passenger-km is in the range of 1.0 to 3.0 MJ per passenger-km,
  or about 30 to 110 g C per passenger-km. Airlines have generally optimized energy
  use per passenger-km, largely because of economic pressures and the requirement
  within the industry to minimize operational costs. Thus, with or without environmental
  considerations, market and cost considerations are drivers for airlines to optimize
  the utilization of an aircraft as much as possible. </p>
<p>CO<span class="subscript">2</span> intensity for rail transport also depends on factors such as energy source,
  type of locomotive, and load factor, and emissions of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> range between < 5
  and 50 g C per passenger-km. However, a passenger's choice of mode of transport
  is based on fares, total trip time, and frequency-not just environmental considerations.
  ECAC (1996) estimates that less than 10% of the European air passenger travel
  could be replaced by high-speed train. Yet the scope for substitution is greater
  in Europe than in many other parts of the world. </p>
<p>Other operational factors to reduce aircraft fuel burn include optimization
  of cruise speed, reduction of tankering, reduction of additional weight, and
  energy savings at the airport such as limitations on the use of APUs and reduced
  taxi times. The total potential reduction in fuel burn by further optimization
  of these factors is in the range of 2-6%. The relative contribution of each
  factor is indicated in <a href="126.htm#tab86">Table 8-6</a>. </p>
<p>Finally, aircraft noise mitigation measures such as operational changes and
  retrofitting of engine equipment on older aircraft to conform with current aircraft
  noise standards could have an adverse effect on fuel use. Application of hushkits
  could lead to an increase in fuel consumption of up to 5%. However, lightweight
  hushkits may have a negligible effect on fuel use. </p>
