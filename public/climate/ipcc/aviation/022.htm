<H2><b>2.1. Relating Aircraft Emissions to Atmospheric Ozone</b></H2>
<h3><b> 2.1.1. Introduction </b></h3>
<p>The chemical products of aircraft jet fuel combustion are emitted at the engine
  nozzle exit plane as part of a high-velocity plume. This gaseous and particulate
  stream is subject to chemical and dynamical processes that influence downstream
  composition. Eventually, plume constituents irreversibly mix with, and are diluted
  by, ambient air. Subsequently, some of the emitted species act in concert with
  other natural and anthropogenic chemicals to change ozone abundances in the
  Earth's atmosphere. The ultimate fates of these aircraft-derived species are
  determined by larger-scale chemical and transport processes. </p>
<p>Concerns about NO and NO<span class="subscript">2</span> (i.e., NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) emissions from present-generation subsonic
  and supersonic aircraft operating in the upper troposphere (UT) and lower stratosphere
  (LS) were raised more than 20 years ago by Hidalgo and Crutzen (1977) because
  these emissions could change ozone levels locally by several percent or so.
  Despite extensive research and evaluation during the intervening years, WMO-UNEP
  (1995) concluded that assessments of ozone changes related to aviation remained
  uncertain and depended critically on NO<span class="subscript">x</span> chemistry and its representation in
  complex models. Because of large uncertainties in present knowledge of the tropospheric
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> budget, little confidence has been placed in previous assessments of quantitative
  model results of subsonic aircraft effects on atmospheric ozone. Assessment
  tools and their input data continue to improve, however, and reconsideration
  is appropriate in the light of the extensive research results published since
  the WMO-UNEP (1995) assessment. </p>
<p>The research results published since the WMO-UNEP (1995) assessment have addressed
  a number of issues relevant to the assessment of ozone impacts of present aviation.
  These issues have included the development of improved aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission
  inventories, updating of evaluated chemical kinetic and photochemical databases,
  studies of aircraft plume chemistry, and the development of three-dimensional
  (3-D) modeling tools. Reviews have also been published of U.S. (Friedl, 1997)
  and European (Schumann et al., 1997; Brasseur et al., 1998) research programs
  addressing ozone and other environmental impacts of present aviation. </p>
<p>In this chapter we evaluate, from a qualitative and quantitative standpoint,
  the impact on atmospheric ozone of aircraft exhaust species, emitted either
  directly from engines or produced as secondary products of processes occurring
  in aircraft plumes. Our evaluation is based primarily on global model calculations
  rather than ozone trends because expected changes are not easily discerned from
  observations, as discussed below. We use intermodel comparisons and atmospheric
  observations of ozone to test the physics and chemistry parameterized in these
  global models and identify areas of remaining uncertainty. </p>
<h4><i><a name="2111"></a>2.1.1.1. Aircraft Engine Emissions</i></h4>
<p>Most present-day jet aircraft cruise in an altitude range (9-13 km) that contains
  portions of the UT and LS. Because these two atmospheric regions are characterized
  by different dynamics and photochemistry, the placement of aircraft exhaust
  into these regions must be considered when evaluating the impact of exhaust
  species on atmospheric ozone. Determination of the partitioning of exhaust into
  the two atmospheric regions is complicated by the highly variable and latitudinally
  dependent character of the tropopause (i.e., the transition between the stratosphere
  and troposphere). Comparisons of aircraft cruise altitudes with mean tropopause
  heights has led to estimates for stratospheric release of 20-40% of total emissions
  (Hoinka et al., 1993; Baughcum, 1996; Schumann, 1997; Gettleman and Baughcum,
  1999). </p>
<p>Carbon dioxide CO<span class="subscript">2</span>) and water vapor (H<span class="subscript">2</span>O) are easily the most abundant products
  of jet fuel combustion (emission indices for CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O are 3.15 kg/kg fuel
  burned and 1.26 kg/kg fuel, respectively). However, both species have significant
  natural background levels in the UT and the LS (Schumann, 1994; WMO-UNEP, 1995).
  and neither current aircraft emission rates nor likely future subsonic emission
  rates will affect the ambient levels by more than a few percent. Future supersonic
  aviation, on the other hand (which would emit at higher altitudes), could perturb
  ambient H<span class="subscript">2</span>O levels significantly at cruise altitudes. Regardless of the magnitude
  of the aircraft source, CO<span class="subscript">2</span> does not participate directly in ozone photochemistry
  because of its thermodynamic and photochemical stability. It may participate
  indirectly by affecting stratospheric cooling, which can in turn lead to changes
  in atmospheric thermal stratification, increased polar stratospheric cloud (PSC)
  formation, and reduced ozone concentrations. </p>
<p>Aircraft water contributions, although relatively small in the troposphere,
  lead to the atmospheric phenomenon of contrail formation. Depending on the precise
  composition of contrail particles-which is largely determined by the specific
  processes occurring in the aircraft plume and by the ambient atmosphere composition
  and temperature-the particles may act as surfaces for a variety of heterogeneous
  reactions (K�rcher et al., 1995; Louisnard et al., 1995; WMO-UNEP, 1995; Schumann
  et al., 1996; Danilin et al., 1997; K�rcher, 1997; Karol et al., 1997). The
  participation of contrails in atmospheric photochemistry is further addressed
  in <a href="024.htm">Section 2.1.3</a>. </p>
<p> NO<span class="subscript">x</span> constitutes the next most abundant engine emission (emission indices range
  from 5 to 25 g of NO<span class="subscript">2</span> per kg of fuel burned) (Fahey et al., 1995; WMO-UNEP,
  1995; Schulte and Schlager, 1996; Schulte et al., 1997). With respect to ozone
  photochemistry, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is the most important and most studied component; its aircraft
  emission rates are sufficient to affect background levels in the UT and LS.
  Moreover, its active role in ozone photochemistry in the UT and LS has been
  well recognized (WMO-UNEP, 1985, 1995). A great deal of the recent scientific
  literature has focused on aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> effects, and this chapter neccessarily
  reflects that focus. Aircraft carbon moNO<span class="subscript">x</span>ide (CO) emissions are of the same
  order of magnitude as NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions (i.e., 1-2 g kg<sup>-1</sup> for the Concorde aircraft
  and 1-10 g kg<sup>-1</sup> for subsonic aircraft) (Baughcum et al., 1996). Like NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, CO
  is a key participant in tropospheric ozone production. However, natural and
  non-aircraft anthropogenic sources of CO are substantially larger than analogous
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources, thereby reducing the role of aircraft CO emissions in ozone photochemistry
  to a level far below that of aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions (WMO-UNEP, 1995). </p>
<p>Emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<span class="subscript">2</span>) and hydrocarbons from aircraft, at less than
  1 g kg<sup>-1</sup> fuel, are significantly less than the more prominent exhaust species
  discussed above (Spicer et al., 1994; Slemr et al., 1998). Their primary potential
  impacts are related to formation of sulfate and carbonaceous aerosols that may
  serve as sites for heterogeneous chemistry. This possibility is discussed in
  <a href="024.htm">Section 2.1.3</a>. Non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) emissions
  may also contribute to autocatalytic production of HO<span class="subscript">x</span>, provided that the reactivity
  of the NHMCs is sufficiently large relative to that of CH<span class="subscript">4</span> to overcome their
  numerical inferiority. However, model studies have indicated that volatile organic
  emissions from aircraft have an insignificant impact on atmospheric ozone at
  cruise altitudes (Hayman and Markiewicz, 1996; Pleijel, 1998). </p>
<h4><i><a name="2112"></a>2.1.1.2. Plume and Wake Processing of Engine Emissions</i></h4>
<p>Although jet exhaust spends a relatively short time in the immediate vicinity
  behind the aircraft, a number of important processes occur during that time
  that influence exhaust gas and aerosol composition, hence the ozone-forming
  or ozone-depleting potential of the exhaust. The near-field evolution of jet
  aircraft exhaust wake can be divided into three distinct regimes-commonly termed
  jet, vortex, and plume dispersion. The time scales associated with these regimes
  are 0-10 s for the jet, 10-100 s for the vortex, and 100 s to tens of hours
  for plume dispersion-the latter time period defining the effective "lifetime"
  of the aircraft plume. The jet and vortex regimes are closely related; they
  are initiated at the exit plane of the engine nozzle and ended by atmospheric
  shear forces at distances of approximately 10-20 km behind the aircraft (Hoshizaki,
  1975; Schumann, 1994). </p>
<p>Several fluid dynamic models are now available to study wake dynamics-namely,
  two-dimensional (2-D) jet mixing codes (Miake-Lye et al., 1993; Beier and Schreier,
  1994; K�rcher, 1994; Garnier et al., 1996) and codes that capture the jet/vortex
  interaction and vortex break-up (Quackenbush et al., 1993; Lewellen and Lewellen,
  1996; Schilling et al., 1996), some of them using vortex filament methods combined
  with large eddy simulations (LES) (Gerz and Ehret, 1997). </p>
<p>The small spatial and temporal scales of exhaust species distributions in near-field
  wakes hamper a robust comparison of model simulations with in situ observations
  of exhaust effluents. Nevertheless, the dynamic models have been successful
  in explaining the few observations of near-field tracer concentration, temperature,
  and humidity (Anderson et al., 1996; Garnier et al., 1996; Gerz and Ehret, 1997;
  Gerz and K�rcher, 1997). The data and calculations reveal a strong suppression
  of plume mixing and dispersion during the vortex regime. Vortex systems are
  composed of cylindrical core regions, not well mixed radially and entraining
  only small amounts of ambient air. As a result, vortex plume temperatures and
  associated H<span class="subscript">2</span>O concentrations may be well defined from fluid dynamic simulations
  and known emission indices. Within the vortex, high concentrations of exhaust
  species interact with each other and with small amounts of ambient gases and
  particles over a range of temperatures that differ from those in the background
  atmosphere. It is likely that some of the chemical interactions occurring in
  the vortex regime will influence the eventual composition of aircraft-derived
  aerosol particles and gases. </p>
<p>The plume dispersion regime begins after disintegration of the wake vortex
  and extends to an area where the primary exhaust gas concentrations (i.e., NO<span class="subscript">x</span>,
  H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, CO, CO<span class="subscript">2</span>) are of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding ambient
  background levels. Results from modeling and observational studies of aged plumes
  (Karol et al., 1997; Meijer et al., 1997; Schlager et al., 1997; Schumann et
  al., 1998) show that most plumes mix with the background atmosphere according
  to a simple dilution law that can be approximated with a Gaussian plume model
  that includes estimated and measured atmospheric shear and diffusion parameters
  (Konopka, 1995; Schumann et al., 1995; Durbeck and Gerz, 1996). The key observables
  for these models have been ice particles in visible contrails and measured CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  that serve as tracers of the plume mixing process. All of the studies have indicated
  that during the 10-20 hrs of plume dispersion, the plume cross-section may grow
  to 50-100 km in width and 0.3-1.0 km in height, with a corresponding exhaust
  species dilution ratio (R-the ratio of the plume mass to fuel mass) up to 10<sup>8</sup>
  as a result of ambient air entrainment. From analysis of more than 70 aircraft
  plume crossings by research aircraft in the North Atlantic flight corridor,
  Schumann et al. (1998) proposed that R can be approximated by R=7000 (t/t<span class="subscript">0</span>)0.8,
  where t<span class="subscript">0</span> = 1s for 0.006 < t < 10<sup>4</sup> s. The relative rate, (dR/dt)/R, of ambient
  air entrainment into the plume is on the order of 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in the first minutes
  of plume dispersion but decreases to on the order of 10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> over a 1-2 hr
  period (Durbeck and Gerz, 1996). </p>
<p>In the plume dispersion stage, aircraft-derived gas and particle concentrations
  are still highly elevated over background levels, but they interact with large
  volumes of ambient species under temperature and pressure conditions of the
  background atmosphere. The composition and reactive characteristics of aircraft-derived
  particles fully evolve in the vortex and plume dispersion regions as a result
  of aerosol-precursor photochemistry and particle condensation, coagulation,
  and agglomeration processes. These particle-forming processes are described
  in further detail in <a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a>. In addition, chemistry process model calculations
  indicate that a significant fraction of emitted NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is converted to other reactive
  nitrogen (NO<span class="subscript">y</span>) species in the plume dispersion region during the daylight (Karol
  et al., 1997; Meijer et al., 1997; Petry et al., 1998). Observations of NO<span class="subscript">y</span>
  in aircraft plume compositions are consistent with these results (Schlager et
  al., 1997). </p>
<h4><i><a name="2113"></a>2.1.1.3. Atmospheric Ozone</i></h4>
<p>Most interactions between ambient ozone and ozone-controlling gases and aircraft
  exhaust occur in the days and weeks following emission. Dispersion of exhaust
  on regional and global scales is dictated by the same large-scale atmospheric
  dynamic processes that control mixing of other natural and anthropogenic sources
  of gases and particles. During that time, aircraft-derived gases and particles
  participate in the natural chemical cycles that control ambient ozone levels.
  The following subsections provide an overview of ozone chemistry. </p>
<h4><i><a name="21131"></a>2.1.1.3.1. Stratospheric ozone</i></h4>
<p>Approximately 80% of atmospheric ozone resides in the stratosphere, where it
  is produced via in situ photochemistry occurring predominantly in the tropical
  middle stratosphere, albeit with significant contributions from mid-latitudes.
  Stratospheric circulation patterns transport ozone from the tropical stratosphere
  poleward and then downward from the mid-stratosphere predominantly in the winter
  hemisphere. Stratospheric ozone is not only transported but also destroyed via
  photochemical reactions over the whole stratosphere. In addition, about 7-25%
  of the total ozone mass (WMO-UNEP, 1985; Wauben et al., 1998) is transported
  to the extratropical troposphere; this type of transport occurs most intensively
  in the winter and in the Northern Hemisphere. Different transport modes correspond
  to different time scales, ranging from days to years. </p>
<p>Ozone formation and destruction rates increase with height and change with
  latitude in the stratosphere. Consequently, ozone "lifetime" decreases with
  height from about a year in the LS to minutes in the upper stratosphere. At
  the uppermost altitudes, ozone lifetime is sufficiently short that its abundance
  is in local photochemical equilibrium (WMO-UNEP, 1985). </p>
<p>At lower altitudes, ozone is not in photochemical steady-state, and ozone transport
  by air motions of various scales becomes increasingly important. The primary
  mechanism for mean global stratospheric transport is referred to as the Brewer-Dobson
  circulation, with rising motion in the equatorial belt of the LS and air mass
  spreading to the poles in the middle and upper stratosphere, with more intensive
  transport into the winter hemisphere. </p>
<p>In summary, stratospheric ozone distributions are determined mainly by atmospheric
  motions in the nightime polar regions, by a mixture of transport and photochemistry
  in the lower and middle stratosphere, and by photochemistry in the upper stratosphere.
</p>
<h4><i><a name="21132"></a>2.1.1.3.2. Tropospheric ozone </i></h4>
<p>Sources of ozone in the troposphere are more numerous than in the stratosphere,
  as are the photochemical reactions participating in ozone production and loss.
  Although in situ photochemistry is the dominant source of tropospheric ozone,
  downward flux of stratospheric ozone represents a significant source, especially
  in the UT and in winter over high latitudes. Removal of tropospheric ozone occurs
  predominantly by photochemistry, with some contribution from surface deposition.
</p>
<p>The lifetime of ozone in the troposphere varies with latitude and altitude;
  in general it is of the order of 1 month, a value that is smaller than the time
  scale for transport between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere troposphere,
  which is typically about 1 year (WMO-UNEP, 1985). </p>
<h4><i><a name="21133"></a>2.1.1.3.3. Stratosphere/troposphere exchange</i></h4>
<p> As mentioned in <a href="022.htm#2111">Section 2.1.1.1</a>, emissions from
  present aviation are injected near the tropopause. Dynamic, chemical, and radiative
  coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere are among the important processes
  that must be understood if we are to provide an adequate description and prediction
  of the impact of aviation on atmosphere and climate. Of special significance
  is the exchange of chemical species between the stratosphere and the troposphere.
  In the stratosphere, large-scale transport takes place via the Brewer-Dobson
  circulation, induced by momentum deposition by planetary gravity waves. This
  circulation is responsible for the observed difference between the stratospheric
  temperature and its radiative equilibrium value. However, this exchange involves
  a wide spectrum of scales ranging from large-scale ascent and descent via synoptic
  scales toward transport by waves, convection, and turbulence (Brewer, 1949;
  Holton et al., 1995; McIntyre, 1995). For the impact of subsonic aviation, the
  focus is on the exchange between the troposphere and the lowermost stratosphere
  (Hoskins et al., 1985). This part of the stratosphere is strongly coupled with
  the troposphere and is separated from the LS by a region enclosed between the
  380 K and 400 K potential temperature surfaces (Holton et al., 1995).</p>
<p>For the transport, it is useful to distinguish between different regions of
  the globe:</p>
<ul>
  <p>In the tropics, upward transport occurs mostly through deep convection, though
    small-scale vertical mixing by gravity waves might also play an important
    role. The tropics are the regions on Earth in which the largest net upward
    transport into the stratosphere occurs and which therefore directly influence
    the composition of the global middle stratosphere. Mixing between the tropical
    and mid-latitude lower stratosphere is influenced by the subtropical barrier.
    Between the tropical UT and subtropical LS, however, transport along isentropic
    surfaces is important (Minschwaner et al., 1996; Plumb, 1996; Volk et al.,
    1996).<br> 
    In mid-latitudes, the exchange between the troposphere and lowermost
    stratosphere flows in both directions, with a somewhat larger downward component
    (Siegmund et al., 1996). Most of this transport is related to the occurrence
    of extra-tropical cyclones and blocking anticyclones. In cyclones, polar stratospheric
    air is drawn into the troposphere while subtropical tropospheric air is drawn
    into the stratosphere. The intermediate process of tropopause folding is followed
    by re-establishment of the tropopause. There is evidence that upward and lateral
    mixing of tropospheric air into the stratosphere remains limited to the lowest
    few kilometers of the mid-latitude LS (Dessler et al., 1995; Boering et al.,
    1996; Hintsa et al., 1998).<br>
    Around the polar vortices, the exchange in the stratosphere occurs along isentropic
    surfaces, from the polar vortex toward mid-latitudes, by filaments torn off
    from the vortex boundary. Vertical transport in the vortex itself mostly takes
    place in the form of large-scale descent caused by radiative cooling. Horizontal
    transport on the equatorward flank of the polar night jet is sharply coupled
    with vertical transport associated with diabatic descent caused by radiative
    cooling of warm air within the descending branch of the baroclinic circulation
    (Pierce et al., 1993, 1994).</p>
