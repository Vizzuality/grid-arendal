<h3>6.3.3. Radiative Forcing for O<font size="-1">3</font></h3>
<p>Ozone is a potent greenhouse gas whose concentration is highly variable and
  controlled by atmospheric chemistry and dynamics. Aircraft emissions of NO<font size="-2">x</font>
  accelerate local photochemical production of O<font size="-2">3</font> in the
  troposphere; modeling studies suggest that these emissions are responsible today
  for average O<font size="-2">3</font> enhancements of 2-5 ppbv in the middle
  troposphere at northern mid-latitudes, where most aircraft fly (see <a href="020.htm">Chapters
  2</a> and <a href="044.htm">4</a>). This ozone increase will generally be proportional
  to the amount of NO<font size="-2">x</font> emitted (Grewe et al., 1999), but
  evolving atmospheric composition, including increases in surface sources of
  combustion-related NO<font size="-2">x</font>, will affect the aircraft impact.
</p>
<p>Four subsonic ozone perturbations based on detailed 3-D patterns of NO<font size="-2">x</font>
  emissions were chosen (along with their control atmospheres) for the calculation
  of RFs: NASA-1992, NASA-2015, FESGa (tech 1), and FESGe (tech 1) at 2050. Results
  for NASA-1992 were scaled by 1.15 to give NASA-1992*, and those for NASA-2015
  by 1.05 to give NASA-2015*. <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table 6-1</a> describes
  some of the basic properties of these aircraft scenarios, including total NO<font size="-2">x</font>
  emissions. <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> supplied the seasonal pattern of
  O<font size="-2">3</font> perturbations for these scenarios based on model calculations
  and reported a factor of 2 uncertainty in this best value. The modeled RFs from
  these O<font size="-2">3</font> perturbations agree quite well, and the stratospheric
  temperature adjustment does not greatly affect the result (as was confirmed
  by two independent model calculations). Given the predominantly tropospheric
  perturbation, the uncertainty in modeling RF is small, and the uncertainty in
  the final result may be a factor of only 3. The ozone RFs are +0.023 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>
  for NASA-1992*, +0.040 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> for NASA-2015*, and +0.060
  W m<font size="-1">-2</font> for FESGa (tech1) 2050 (see also <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table
  6-1</a>). </p>
<p>The development of atmospheric chemistry models in the past 2 years has allowed
  a consensus to build such that aircraft ozone perturbations can be calculated
  with a likely (2/3 probability) range of about a factor of 2 (higher/lower,
  see <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Our estimate of the resulting RF for this
  predominantly tropospheric perturbation does not significantly enhance that
  interval. </p>
<p>The NASA-1992, NASA-2015, and FESGa (tech 1) at 2050 scenarios produce global
  mean column ozone increases (predominantly tropospheric) of 0.5, 1.1, and 1.7
  Dobson Units (DU), respectively. Our estimate of the increase in tropospheric
  ozone associated with all anthropogenic changes (IS92a including aircraft plus
  surface emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, CO, and hydrocarbons) is about 3 DU from 1992 to 2015
  and 7 DU from 1992 to 2050. These results represent an advance in our understanding
  since the Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996), when future ozone changes were
  scaled only to CH<font size="-2">4</font> increases and did not include the
  effects of doubling NO<font size="-2">x</font> emissions from 1990 to 2050.
</p>
<p>Two HSCT cases with detailed 3-D emission scenarios-one with 500 aircraft and
  the other with 1,000 aircraft-were used to calculate RF from stratospheric O<font size="-2">3</font>
  and H<font size="-2">2</font>O perturbations (see <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table
  6-1</a>). Most of the ozone change occurs above the tropopause; thus, there
  is poorer agreement among RF models and a greater difference in RF values after
  stratospheric temperatures adjust. The ozone perturbation calculated for 500
  supersonic aircraft with the 2015 background atmosphere is substantially different
  in nature from that calculated for 1,000 aircraft with the 2050 atmosphere,
  in part because of specified changes in chlorine and methane contents of the
  stratosphere (see <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Nevertheless, the best RF
  values are about the same: -0.01 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>. The uncertainty
  range in these values is large and changes sign (-0.04 to +0.01 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>),
  reflecting not only the range in O<font size="-2">3</font> perturbations given
  by <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> but also the large uncertainty in deriving
  RF for stratospheric perturbations. This ozone-related RF for the HSCT fleet
  is based only on the stratospheric ozone perturbation calculated by the models
  in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>; the tropospheric changes are discarded,
  and a correction for the displacement of about 11% of the subsonic traffic is
  included, as shown in <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table 6-1</a> (scenario Fa1H).
