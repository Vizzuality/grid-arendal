<!-- #BeginEditable "Page_Content_Here" --> <h2>9.6. Evaluation and Assessment of Long-Term Subsonic Scenarios </h2>
<h3><a name="961"></a>9.6.1. Difficulties in Constructing Long-Term Scenarios</h3>
<p>Long-term (beyond 20 years) projections of aviation traffic demand, fleet fuel
  burned, and fleet emissions are inevitably speculative. Difficulty in forecasting
  technological developments that might be appropriate for the long term, possible
  shifts in traffic demand, and myriad uncertainties resulting from human society's
  development over the period in question all conspire to make long-term projections
  unreliable-sometimes astoundingly so. Given the state of the aviation industry
  50 years ago (in 1947), it is doubtful that either the technology or the scope
  of the industry in 1997 could have been forecast. However, because the transport
  aviation market and aviation technology seem to be maturing, a plausible way
  of making projections far into the future is to make reasonable extrapolations
  based on our knowledge of present trends in the world and in the aviation industry.
  These extrapolations are termed scenarios, rather than forecasts, as outlined
  in <a href="132.htm">Section 9.1</a>. </p>

<h3><a name="962"></a>9.6.2. Structure and Assumptions</h3>
<p>Before we review the outcomes of the scenario studies in the following section,
  we consider some differences and similarities between the models. This comparison
  is restricted to the EDF, DTI, and FESG models. Although the MIT model provides
  an interesting insight into future travel options based on the thesis of invariant
  travel time and travel expenditure budgets, it is excluded from this comparison
  because it provides only a highly aggregated scenario for the future mobility
  of total motorized passenger traffic; air traffic is only one-albeit important-portion
  of this picture, and the aircraft component cannot be identified. The WWF aviation
  scenario for 2041 provides aggregated fuel burned and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions projections
  but does not provide regionally distributed NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions estimates. </p>
<p>Of the long-term scenarios considered, the EDF, FESG, and DTI studies allow
  assessment of the impacts of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> from aviation. However, only the results from
  the DTI and the FESG models are suitable for use in chemical transport models
  for modeling other emissions (see Chapters <a href="020.htm">2</a> and <a href="044.htm">4</a>)
  and their effects on radiative forcing (see <a href="063.htm">Chapter 6</a>)
  because they provide gridded data that include a consideration of the potential
  changes in the spatial distribution of emissions. Only the EDF study provides
  scenarios for demand from the aviation sector and subsequent global CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions to 2100. The EDF study provided 10 scenarios based on five different
  IPCC IS92 world scenarios for the long-term development of world economy and
  population and two air traffic demand scenarios (base case and high case). The
  FESG study calculated three air traffic demand scenarios based on the IPCC IS92a,
  IS92c, and IS92e world scenarios, which were combined with two engine technology
  scenarios to produce six different emissions inventories. The FESG scenarios
  of regional and global air traffic were based on a logistic regression model
  of traffic demand since 1960 using global GDP as a predictor. The FESG model
  used a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, in which global volumes
  of civil aircraft flight kilometers were predicted using the regression model
  for different GDP scenarios. All available information on regions, including
  regional variation in growth, was then used to disaggregate these global values
  in a consistent way over 45 traffic flows within and between the regions of
  the world by using a market share allocation model. Year 2050 values of fuel
  burned and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions for military traffic were estimated separately. </p>
<p>The EDF scenarios also were based on the use of logistic growth curves to model
  air traffic growth for business and personal travel (plus military and freight
  traffic). Model parameters were chosen through observation of historical traffic
  trends in the United States. Regional population was used as a predictor of
  personal passenger travel, and regional GNP was used as a predictor of business
  passenger travel and freight demand. Both the FESG and EDF models incorporate
  the underlying assumption that the chosen parameters are satisfactory predictors
  of aviation demand and that aviation markets eventually mature. </p>
<p>There are large differences between the EDF and FESG models with respect to
  the development of emissions scenarios. The EDF model uses a constant capacity
  logistic to describe fuel efficiency improvements, which extrapolates Greene's
  (1992) forecast to 2010 with varied rates for five geographic world regions
  and the military/freight aviation sector. For the trend in fleet EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) a single
  global logistic model extrapolates from the 1990 and 2015 values. The FESG scenarios
  are based on two engine technology scenarios developed by ICCAIA for ICAO/FESG
  and IPCC (see <a href="088.htm">Chapter 7</a>). These scenarios represent an
  industry perspective on likely future developments in fuel efficiency and NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  reduction technologies, as well as further potentials and limitations. The fuel
  efficiency technology element of the DTI scenario was similar in this respect,
  but a NO<span class="subscript">x</span> technology scenario appropriate to stricter emissions regulations
  was assumed, in which subsonic engine research programs would deliver emissions
  levels similar to those targeted in the NASA HSCT program.</p>
<p>Additional assumptions are also important to the results of the scenario models.
  In the EDF model, assumptions about the dates of market expansion and maturity
  and the ultimate capacity levels chosen for the economic regions strongly influence
  the outcomes. The EDF, FESG, and DTI models all use statistics of traffic/air
  traffic from international organizations and OECD countries, as well as numerous
  other recently published sources, and adopt one or more of the IPCC IS92 scenarios
  to describe the long-term development of worldwide economic growth and population.
  The FESG, EDF, and DTI models also use information from the NASA and ANCAT/EC
  gridded inventories of traffic flows and related emissions. The FESG models
  used new, partly proprietary, information from industry as a base to project
  emissions in the year 2050. </p>
<p>None of the 3-D gridded inventories for 2050 assume any changes in design that
  would alter the cruise altitudes of subsonic aircraft. Furthermore, no consideration
  was given in any of the 2050 scenarios reported here to the possible stimulative
  (or otherwise) effect of HSCT introductions on traffic. </p>
