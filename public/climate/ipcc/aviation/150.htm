<!-- #BeginEditable "Page_Content_Here" --> <h2>10.1. Introduction </h2>
<p>Although the introduction of aircraft emissions reduction technology (see <a href="088.htm">Chapter
  7</a>), ATM improvements, and other aircraft operational measures (see <a href="118.htm">Chapter
  8</a>) highlight the technological potential to reduce future aircraft emissions,
  the question has been raised about whether these technologies will be adopted
  by industry and implemented by governments at sufficient levels and soon enough
  to appropriately address projected scenarios of growth in aviation traffic and
  emissions (<a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a>). </p>
<p>This chapter reviews policy measures that are viewed as ways of accelerating
  emission mitigation trends, if needed (IPCC, 1996b). Such measures for policymakers
  include initiatives to ensure timely implementation of CNS/ATM, development
  of regulatory standards and recommended practices, market-based measures such
  as environmental levies (taxes and charges), and emissions trading. This chapter
  also examines analytical frameworks to evaluate alternative policy options.
</p>
<p>When evaluating potential mitigation measures for aviation, policymakers probably
  would benefit from having reliable information on the relative costs of mitigating
  aviation's greenhouse gas or other emissions compared with the costs of mitigating
  emissions from other sources. At present, however, it is not known whether addressing
  aviation is likely to be more or less costly than achieving comparable reductions
  from other sources. </p>
<p>In terms of guidance, the 1995 IPCC assessment states, "Achieving the economic
  and policy potential of greenhouse gas reductions ... depends on the economic
  and other priorities of the providers and users of transport services. The extent
  to which these potentials are achieved depends on a complex interaction among
  technology, the economy, and choices made by consumers, producers, and policymakers.
  It is this interaction that most needs to be understood and addressed if policymakers
  wish to limit greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector." (IPCC, 1996a).
</p>
<p>Because most developed and developing country economies depend on aviation
  services, balancing the individual interests of aviation stakeholders with the
  broader public interest, including environmental interests, is critical. It
  is also important to understand the institutional and global context in which
  the industry operates, the drivers of aviation economic activity, and the incentives
  and motivations of the parties. </p>
<p>In addition, the literature on this subject suggests that flexible, cost-effective
  policies that rely on economic incentives, as well as the coordinated use of
  policy instruments, can considerably reduce mitigation or adaptation costs and
  increase the cost-effectiveness of emission reduction measures. Appropriate
  long-run signals are required to allow producers and consumers to adapt cost
  effectively to constraints on greenhouse gas emissions and to encourage investment,
  research, development, and demonstration (IPCC, 1996c). To attain the proper
  balance of interests, international standardization of regulations and economic
  instruments and uniformity in application are necessary. Other criteria in assessing
  the effectiveness of policy tools are environmental need, technical feasibility
  of proposed solutions, and ease of implementation.</p>
