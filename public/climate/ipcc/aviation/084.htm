<h3>6.6.2. Uncertainties and Confidence Intervals</h3>
<p>Throughout this report, we focus on "best estimates" for each component of
  atmospheric perturbations caused by aircraft and then of subsequent climate
  forcing or ultraviolet change. We also try to understand the confidence that
  we have in these estimates using uncertainty ranges deduced in <a href="020.htm">Chapters
  2</a>, <a href="031.htm">3</a>, and <a href="044.htm">4</a> and those from the
  modeling and combining of RF in this chapter. </p>
<p>Uncertainties in estimating aviation's RF values are addressed with a confidence
  interval (indicated by error bars or whiskers about each best value) and a description
  ("good," "fair," "poor," "very poor") of the level of scientific understanding
  of the physical processes, models, and data on which the calculation is based.
  The confidence intervals shown in <a href="083.htm#img614b">Figures 6-14b</a>
  and <a href="avf6-15b.htm">6-15b</a> define a likelihood range such that the
  probability that the true value falls within the interval is 2/3. The interval
  and the quality-of-the-science descriptions are, to a large extent, independent
  measures covering different aspects of uncertainty. </p>
<p>The likelihood range is defined consistently within this report as the 2/3
  or 67% probability range. These probability ranges are meant to be symmetric
  about the best value; hence, the best value is not always the mean of the upper
  and lower values. In this case, the probability that the value is less than
  the lower value is 16%, and the probability that it is less than the upper value
  is 84%. The range between the low and high values is equivalent to the "1-sigma"
  range of a normal (i.e., Gaussian) probability distribution. Unfortunately,
  derivation of these confidence intervals lies with the expert judgment of the
  scientists contributing to each chapter and may include a combination of objective
  statistical models and subjective expertise. Thus, the 67% confidence intervals
  do not imply a specific statistical model and, for example, cannot be used to
  infer the probability of extreme events beyond the stated confidence interval.
</p>
<p>The confidence interval in RF stated here combines uncertainty in calculating
  atmospheric perturbation to greenhouse gases and aerosols with that of calculating
  radiative forcing. It includes, but is not based solely on, the range of best
  values from different research groups. For example, the interval for the HSCT(1000)
  impact on O<font size="-2">3</font> was derived from high- and low-end calculations
  using different combinations of atmospheric models and chemical assumptions.
  The range in RF from these stratospheric O<font size="-2">3</font> perturbations
  was expanded further in this chapter to account for the difficulty in calculating
  RF for stratospheric perturbations. The tropospheric O<font size="-2">3</font>
  perturbation from the subsonic fleet (scenario Fa1) was presented with the 67%
  confidence interval as a factor of 2 higher and lower than the best value. In
  this case, the RF calculation did not significantly add to the uncertainty because
  tropospheric perturbations can be more accurately calculated. The confidence
  interval for aviation-induced CH<font size="-2">4</font> changes is believed
  to be about 1.5 times larger (log-scale) than that for tropospheric O<font size="-2">3</font>,
  but potential errors in both are highly correlated. The confidence interval
  for contrails is taken directly from <a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a>; the RF
  from additional cirrus clouds is highly uncertain and no probability range is
  given. </p>
<p>The RF uncertainties from different perturbations have been determined by different 
  methods; potential errors in individual components may not be independent of 
  one another, and the error bars may not represent Gaussian statistics. The uncertainty 
  ranges for the totals in <a href="083.htm#fig614">Figures 6-14</a>b and <a href="083.htm#img615a">6-15</a>b 
  do represent a 2/3 probability range as for the individual components. The uncertainty 
  estimate for the total radiative forcing (without additional cirrus) is calculated 
  directly from the individual components as the square root of the sums of the 
  squares of the upper and lower ranges. There is a further issue on confidence 
  levels that is not quantified here-namely, the accuracy of representing the 
  climate perturbation by the sum of RF values that are global means. </p>
<p>Overall, addition of the best values for RF provides a single best estimate
  for the total. The uncertainty ranges for individual impacts can be used to
  assess whether they are potentially major or trivial components and to make
  a subjective judgment of confidence in the summed RF. </p>
