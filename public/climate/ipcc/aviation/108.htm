<h3> 7.7.2. Engine Load and Emission Correlation</h3>
<h4>7.7.2.1. Emission Correlation Methods </h4>
<p>Establishment of an aircraft emissions inventory for a given flight traffic
  scenario requires a knowledge of the engine's emissions over the aircraft's
  total flight mission. This inventory is relatively straightforward for CO<span class="subscript">2</span>,
  H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, and SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O (in total) emissions because of their direct link with mission
  fuel burn. For several other emissions that depend on engine power setting,
  combustor design, and flight condition, correlation methods have been developed
  to calculate the exhaust emissions for a specific engine type using measured
  data taken during the engine certification process. This correlation is carried
  out primarily with species of emissions such as NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, CO, HC, or soot by means
  of a semi-empirical correlation between emissions and principal combustion parameters,
  using measurement programs involving combustor rigs and engine systems together
  with theoretical considerations of the main combustion processes. Exhaust emissions
  production processes generally are complex because they involve unsteady physical
  processes as well as non-equilibrium chemical processes. A fundamental element
  in the development of formulas to correlate measured and predicted emission
  indices is a model of the process based on the relationship of the emission
  index, chemical kinetic rates, and residence time in the reaction zone. This
  model is of great value to manufacturers wishing to predict the emissions performance
  of a new or development combustor. For an existing design, a reference correlation
  method is used to predict emissions on the basis of measured data. Because combustor
  inlet pressure (p<span class="subscript">3</span>) and temperature (T<span class="subscript">3</span>) 
  are the main parameters involved. For EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>), the 
  "p<span class="subscript">3</span>/T<span class="subscript">3</span>" method leads to a relationship 
  that, in its simplest form, is as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)/EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)<span class="subscript">ref</span> 
  = (p<span class="subscript">3</span>/p<span class="subscript">3ref</span>)<sup>n</sup> f(Humidity) for 
  T<span class="subscript">3</span> = T<span class="subscript">3ref</span> where n is an
    exponent in a range between about 0.3 and 0.6 derived from engine and combustor
    rig testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The parameters p<span class="subscript">3</span> and T<span class="subscript">3</span> come either from measurements or from computational
  engine simulation. Measurement programs, especially for NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission indices,
  reveal agreement (compared with testing) of better than 5% (AERONO<span class="subscript">x</span>, 1995; Brasseur
  et al., 1998). Emissions of HC and CO depend on the completeness or efficiency
  of the combustion process. Test data are well correlated using a combustor loading
  parameter, which takes account of the residence time of the burning products
  and reaction time in the combustor reference volume. As an example, <a href="106.htm#img730">Figure
  7-30</a> shows typical functions of emission indices of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and CO versus engine
  load for a turbofan engine at different altitudes on the basis of a thermodynamic
  engine simulation. Unburned hydrocarbons will follow the same trend as CO, but
  on a much lower level. Both are products of incomplete combustion; thus, they
  are controlled by the same mechanism. </p>
<p>Despite the intrinsic complexity of the chemical processes associated with
  soot production, a semi-empirical correlation between calculated and measured
  SN has been developed with a 40% standard deviation (De Champlain et al., 1997).
  By also considering reaction kinetics, Döpelheuer (1997) developed a correlation
  method based mainly on the concentration of carbon and oxygen in the combustion
  zone. The concentration of soot is considered to be proportional to the equivalence
  ratio, to pressure at the combustor inlet (both with exponents to be determined),
  and to an exponential function controlling the reaction rate. To apply the method
  as a reference type of correlation, soot density as a function of measured SN
  (Finch and Eyl, 1976; Whyte, 1982; Champagne, 1988; Hurley, 1993) has been approximated
  as a first step. Up to a 20% deviation exists between different correlations
  of soot loading and SN. </p>
<p>Because of the limitations of the standard measuring method for SN (i.e., by
  collecting soot on a white filter paper and evaluating reflected light intensity)
  (ICAO, 1993), only the major particles of soot are measured; the remaining wide
  spectrum of very small particles are not measured (see <a href="100.htm">Section
  7.5.3</a>). </p>
<h4><a name="7722"></a>7.7.2.2. Simplified Alternate Correlation Methods</h4>
<p>The methods described above to correlate engine emissions for different operating
  conditions all require engine internal gas path data. Such data are normally
  sensitive from an engine manufacturer's point of view. Alternate correlation
  methods that do not expose proprietary or sensitive engine data have therefore
  been sought. These methods are based mainly on emission correlation with the
  fuel flow of an engine. Thus, SLS engine test data from certification testing,
  together with relevant methods of correlating emissions with engine performance
  in flight, is favored as one of the principal sources for the development of
  aircraft emission inventories. These methods are designed to use unrestricted
  data from the ICAO engine emission databank coupled with fuel flow data, which
  can easily be acquired from aircraft missions. </p>

<p>Several methods based on the above principles have been developed and are undergoing
  continuing improvements. The key element of these simplified methods is the
  assumption that emission indices at different engine inlet conditions might
  be correctable to a reference day condition, thus collapsing into a single function
  of the corrected fuel flow (Lecht and Deidewig, 1994; Martin et al., 1994, 1995;
  Deidewig et al., 1996). An example of the effectiveness of such a method developed
  for NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions is outlined in <a href="106.htm#img731">Figures 7-31</a> and
  <a href="106.htm#img732">7-32</a>. <a href="106.htm#img731">Figure 7-31</a>
  shows actual NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission indices according to ambient flight conditions and
  calculated with a complex correlation formula; <a href="106.htm#img732">Figure
  7-32</a> gives the result of the same values but corrected for ISA SLS conditions.
  For comparison, ICAO LTO cycle test data are marked separately.</p>
<p>This method allows ISA SLS measurements to act as a reference function; this
  function simply has to be re-corrected for actual in-flight engine inlet conditions.
  These simplified emission correlation methods are highly relevant in terms of
  their value for the further development of aircraft emission inventories (see
  <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a>). There is, as yet, no fuel flow-based correlation
  that can be used to predict engine soot for the purposes of inventory preparation
  because of the use of SN data in the ICAO emissions databank, which cannot readily
  be converted to soot loading (Döpelheuer and Lecht, 1999). </p>

<h3><a name="773"></a>7.7.3. Validation of Emission Prediction Methods</h3>
<h4><a name="7731"></a>7.7.3.1. Altitude Chamber Testing</h4>
<p>Cruise-level emission index prediction methods need validation by measurement.
  Such validation can be carried out at ground-level test chambers in which pressure
  and temperature can be varied to simulate a wide range of engine operation conditions
  in flight. Within the AERONO<span class="subscript">x</span> project, exhaust emissions of two selected engines
  (Rolls Royce RB211 and Pratt & Whitney PW305) have been analyzed and compared
  with predictions (Lister et al., 1995). This comparison shows that emission
  prediction methods developed by engine manufacturers and research institutes
  can predict the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission at a flight condition within an error band of 5-10%
  for a modern high bypass engine. These experiments found a tolerance for fuel-based
  methods that was nearly as good. Measurements from the AERONO<span class="subscript">x</span> project also
  showed that for highest accuracy, the prediction equations must be adapted for
  specific engine type. A kind of indirect validation has been undertaken by comparing
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions of fuel flow-based methods with the 
  p<span class="subscript">3</span>/T<span class="subscript">3</span> method. Such an 
  evaluation showed an agreement within 13% maximum and 6% standard deviation for a variety
  of aircraft and flight missions (ICAO, 1995c).</p>

<p>An alternate suitable method is to carry out measurements in the freshly emitted
  exhaust plume of an aircraft in flight. Several such cruise altitude emissions
  measurement programs have been conducted. Cruise altitude in situ chemical probing
  was carried out for the first time in December 1991, when the DLR research aircraft
  "Falcon" flew through the plume of a commercial DC-8 airliner (Arnold et al.,
  1992). In 1993, the first in-flight measurements of emission indices were accomplished,
  again using the "Falcon" (Schulte and Schlager, 1996). This measurement involved
  measuring CO<span class="subscript">2</span> simultaneously with other species of interest (in terms of volume
  mixing ratios). A detailed discussion of these assumptions and the emission
  index determination from the measured ratios D[X]/D[CO<span class="subscript">2</span>] appears in Schulte
  and Schlager (1996). </p>
<p>In recent years, several in situ EI measurements have been carried out. Fahey
  et al. (1995a,b) determined emission indices for NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, CO, and N<span class="subscript">2</span>O in the exhaust
  plumes of the NASA ER-2 research aircraft and the Concorde in the lower stratosphere.
  Haschberger and Lindermeir (1996, 1997) analyzed the exhaust plume of the DLR
  experimental Advanced Technology Testing Aircraft System of DLR, a two-engine
  jet aircraft of type VFW 614 (ATTAS) with onboard instruments and derived emission
  indices for NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, CO, and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O. The subsonic long-range jet aircraft types that
  dominate global air traffic were investigated by Schulte et al. (1997) to derive
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission indices. <a href="107.htm#img733">Figure 7-33</a> shows a comparison of all available in situ
  measured EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) values with corresponding predicted values. Note that the measurement
  details were different for each case. </p>
<p>In summary, these measurements revealed good agreement between predicted and
  measured NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission indices. Special attention was paid to predictions based
  on fuel flow methods (Lecht and Deidewig, 1994; Deidewig et al., 1996; Martin
  et al., 1996; Schulte and Schlager, 1996; Schulte et al., 1997) because they
  are the methods of choice for the building of aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission inventories.
  These methods seem to underestimate EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) by about 12% on average. However,
  this 12% deviation is within the uncertainties-indicated as error bars-of the
  measurements and the predictions. </p>
<h3>7.7.4. Engine Emission Variations<a name="774"></a></h3>
<p>Engine emissions may vary for a number of reasons. Manufacturing differences,
  aging characteristics for individual engines, operational and atmospheric conditions,
  and changes in fuel contents all have parts to play. Data from new engine certification
  testing reveals a standard deviation for EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) of 1-7%. Fuel type, fuel content,
  and sampling methods have only a slight influence on NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission variation
  (Lyon et al., 1980; Lukachko and Waitz, 1997). Another major source of variability
  may be engine deterioration over a long period of time. This deterioration is
  evident in measurements of engine parameters such as exhaust gas temperatures
  and fuel consumption rates. Economic considerations recently led to allowable
  SFC limits of between 2 and 4% because of engine deterioration; exceedances
  lead to engine overhaul. Measurements of overhauled engines revealed a similar
  standard deviation for NO<span class="subscript">x</span> based on the LTO cycle (Lister and Wedlock, 1978),
  which implies that in emissions terms their performance is similar to new engines.
  Lukachko and Waitz (1997) investigated the influence of an ongoing degradation
  process resulting from aging. In a combined sensitivity study, they found that
  a 3% SFC increase from deterioration led to a -1 to +4% change of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission
  efflux, depending on the engine part mostly affected by the deterioration. This
  study was conducted under cruise operating conditions. New consideration is
  being given by ICAO/CAEP to the development of a more appropriate certification
  methodology in terms of emissions variability over the entire flight cycle.</p>
