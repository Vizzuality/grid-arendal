<h2><b>3.7. Parameters of Future Changes in Aircraft-Produced Aerosol and Cloudiness
  </b></h2>
<p>The future effects of aircraft depend on trends in climate and air traffic
  amount and changes in the technical properties of aircraft. Our current understanding
  of the formation of aviation-induced aerosol and cloudiness can be used to estimate
  how future changes may affect the impacts of aviation and to identify mitigation
  options that would be effective in reducing these impacts. </p>
<h3><i><b><a name="371"></a>3.7.1 Changes in Climate Parameters </b></i></h3>
<p>If climate change occurs in the future, atmospheric parameters related to aerosols
  and contrails will also have changed. Of particular importance to aviation-induced
  aerosol and cloudiness are changes in temperature and humidity in the upper
  troposphere and lower stratosphere; changes in the height, temperature, and
  humidity of the tropopause region; changes in the abundance of particles; and
  changes in cloudiness. <a href="040.htm#tab310">Table 3-10</a> summarizes how
  changes in these parameters may be reflected in aviation-related impacts. General
  circulation models of the atmosphere predict that the climate of 2050 will reflect
  global warming from the accumulation of greenhouse gases. In this new climate,
  models predict increases in the amounts of cirrus clouds, the height of the
  tropopause, and upper tropospheric temperature (IPCC, 1996; Timbal et al., 1997).
  A higher tropopause would cause more contrails, at least at high latitudes.
  Observed temperature changes (e.g., Parker et al., 1997) do not reveal the expected
  temperature increase in the upper troposphere. Some models predict a higher
  tropopause if the surface temperature increases (about 200-m altitude increase
  for 1 K surface temperature increase) (Thuburn and Craig, 1997). Increases on
  the order of 100 m were analyzed in polar regions and at mid-latitudes (Hoinka,
  1998; Steinbrecht et al., 1998). Such changes may be forced by cooling of the
  lower stratosphere as a result of changes in ozone concentration (Hansen et
  al., 1997) and increases in moisture as a result of increasing methane concentrations.
  Stratospheric temperatures between 50 and 100 hPa have decreased by about 1
  to 2 K since 1980 (Ramaswamy et al., 1996; Halpert and Bell, 1997). An increase
  in water vapor concentration has been observed in the lower stratosphere, with
  the largest trend (0.8%/yr) in the 18- to 20-km region (Oltmans and Hofmann,
  1995). Because few contrails currently form in the lower stratosphere, small
  changes in stratospheric conditions will not create significant changes in contrail
  abundance. Aerosol loading in the troposphere and lower stratosphere may increase
  because of changed climate conditions and increased surface emissions. Surface
  emissions from fossil fuel burning were projected to grow by a factor of 1.5
  to 2.1 from 1990 to 2040 (Wolf and Hidy, 1997). </p>

<h3><i><b><a name="372"></a>3.7.2. Changes in Subsonic Aircraft </b></i></h3>
<p>By the year 2050, the number of aircraft flying in the upper troposphere is
  expected to have increased significantly (see <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a>).
  In scenario Fa1, global annual aviation fuel consumption in 2050 will have increased
  by a factor of 3.2 compared with 1992, with a larger increase (factor of 4.3)
  above 500 hPa. Scenarios Fc1, Fe1, and Eah (see <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a>)
  assume increases by factors of 1.8, 5, and 14, respectively, in total fuel consumption
  compared to 1992. The frequency of contrail formation is expected to increase
  with traffic because large regions of the atmosphere are humid and cold enough
  to allow persistent contrails to form and because such regions are not at present
  fully covered with optically thick cirrus or contrail clouds (see Sections <a href="038.htm#341">3.4.1</a>
  and <a href="038.htm#343">3.4.3</a>). The number of aircraft may grow slightly
  less rapidly than fuel consumption when smaller aircraft are replaced by larger
  ones. This factor is important because the amount of persistent contrail cover
  may depend mainly on the number of aircraft triggering contrails and less on
  fuel consumption. </p>
<p>As aircraft engines become more fuel efficient, contrails will form more frequently
  at lower flight levels because exhaust plumes of more efficient engines are
  cooler for the same water content (see <a href="035.htm#3241">Section 3.2.4.1</a>).
  The overall efficiency h (Cumpsty, 1997) with which engines convert fuel combustion
  heat into propulsion of cruising subsonic aircraft was close to 0.22 in the
  1950s, near 0.37 for modern engines in the early 1990s, and may reach 0.5 for
  new engines to be built by 2010 (see <a href="040.htm#img322">Figure 3-22</a>).
  An increase of h from 0.3 to 0.5 in a standard atmosphere increases the threshold
  formation temperature of contrails by about 2.8 K (equivalent to 700-m lower
  altitude) (Schumann, 1996a). </p>
<p>The change in persistent contrail coverage because of changed traffic has been 
  determined using thermodynamic analysis of meteorological data from 1983 to 
  1992 and fuel consumption data (Sausen et al., 1998) (see <a href="038.htm">Section 
  3.4</a>). This method has been used to estimate future changes in contrail cover 
  resulting from changes in air traffic, assuming a fixed climate, fuel consumption 
  scenarios, and expected engine performance specifications (Gierens et al., 1998). 
  The computed contrail cover (<a href="040.htm#img323">Figure 3-23</a>) for the 
  2050 Fa1 fuel scenario using present analysis data and h of 0.5 shows a global 
  and annual mean contrail cover of 0.47%, with values of 0.26% and 0.75% for 
  scenarios Fc1 and Fe1. Values may be as high as 1 to 2% for scenario Eah, which 
  does not specify the spatial distribution of future traffic and in which contrail 
  cover may become limited by the amount of cloud-free ice-supersaturated air 
  masses. In comparison, values are 0.087% for the 1992 DLR fuel inventory with 
  h of 0.3 and 0.38% for the 2050 scenario with h of 0.3. Hence, contrail cover 
  is expected to increase by a factor of about 5 over present cover for a 3.2-fold 
  increase in annual aviation fuel consumption from 1992 to 2050, even under constant 
  climate conditions. Increased efficiency of propulsion by future engines causes 
  about 20% of the computed increase in contrail cover. In the year 2050, the 
  maximum contrail coverage is expected to occur over Europe (4.6%, 4 times more 
  than 1992), the United States of America (3.7%, 2.6 times more), and southeast 
  Asia (1.2%, 10 times more). Contrail-induced increases in cirrus cloud cover 
  may depend also on wind shear, vertical motions, and existing cirrus cover, 
  which this thermodynamic analysis does not take into account. In addition, changes 
  in climate conditions may influence future contrail formation conditions. </p>
<p>Radiative forcing from contrails was calculated for 2050 using the Fa1 fuel
  scenario and the same method as described in <a href="040.htm#363">Section 3.6.3</a>
  (Minnis et al., 1999). For the contrail cover shown in <a href="040.htm#img323">Figure
  3-23</a>, values of SW, LW, and net forcing were found to be about 6 times larger
  than in 1992 (see <a href="040.htm#tab38">Table 3-8</a>). The increase in radiative
  forcing from 1992 to 2050 is larger than the increase in contrail cover (factor
  of 5) during the same period because additional contrails in the subtropics
  and over Asia over relatively warm and cloud-free surfaces are more effective
  in increasing radiative forcing. The global distribution of radiative forcing
  calculated with this procedure is shown in <a href="040.htm#img324">Figure 3-24</a>
  for an assumed optical depth of 0.3. Radiative forcing grows more strongly globally
  than in regions of present peak traffic. Global mean forcing is 0.1 W m<sup>-2</sup> in
  this computation, with maximum values of 3.0 and 1.4 W m<sup>-2</sup> (3.3 and 2.4 times
  more than 1992) over northeast France and the eastern United States of America,
  respectively. </p>
<p>For an optical depth of 0.3, the best-estimate value of the global radiative
  forcing in 2050 (scenario Fa1) is 0.10 W m<sup>-2</sup>. The uncertainty range is a little
  larger than in 1992, and estimated to amount to a factor of 4. Hence, the likely
  range of forcing extends from 0.03 to 0.4 W m<sup>-2</sup> (see <a href="040.htm#tab39">Table
  3-9</a>). The forcing for other scenarios has not been computed in detail, but
  rough estimates scale with the fuel consumption. The climatic consequences of
  this forcing are discussed in <a href="063.htm">Chapter 6</a>. </p>
<p>An estimate of the range of aviation-induced cirrus cloudiness in 2050, as
  required for this assessment, is not available in the scientific literature.
  For 1992, a range for the best estimate of the additional aviation-induced cirrus
  clouds was derived from decadal trends in high fuel-use regions (0-0.2% global
  cover; <a href="039.htm#3515">Section 3.5.1.5</a>). For the 2050 time period,
  a different approach is required. Observed contrail frequencies and trends in
  cirrus occurrence have been found to correlate with aviation fuel consumption
  (see Figures <a href="avf3-14.htm">3-14</a> and <a href="avf3-18.htm">3-18</a>).
  Therefore, the aviation-induced cirrus cloudiness between 1992 and 2050 is projected
  to grow in proportion to the total aviation fuel consumption in the upper troposphere.
  This fuel consumption grows by a factor of 4 between 1992 and 2050 in scenario
  Fa1. Hence, the best-estimate of additional global cirrus cover in 2050 would
  range from 0 to 0.8%. For the same radiative sensitivity as in 1992, the associated
  radiative forcing could be between 0 and 0.16 W m<sup>-2</sup> or up to 1.6 times the value
  given for line-shaped contrail cirrus in 2050 (see <a href="040.htm#tab39">Table
  3-9</a>). The forcing could be outside this range if future aviation causes
  strong changes in the optical properties of the cirrus clouds. Saturation effects
  (Sausen et al., 1999) will likely limit any increase in cirrus cover in heavy
  air traffic regions. Because of these uncertainties the status of understanding
  of radiative forcing from additional aviation-induced cirrus clouds in 2050
  is very poor. The assessment of the other indirect effects (<a href="040.htm#365">Section
  3.6.5</a>) is beyond the scope of present understanding. </p>
<p>Modern subsonic aircraft cruise most efficiently at flight altitudes of 9 to
  13 km. Trends in aircraft cruise altitudes are discussed in <a href="088.htm">Chapter
  7</a>. If mean flight levels of global air traffic were to increase, the frequency
  of persistent contrails in the troposphere at mid-latitudes would be reduced
  and the frequency in the upper troposphere in the tropics would be increased.
  In addition, the formation of polar stratospheric clouds in the lower polar
  stratosphere (Peter et al., 1991) may be enhanced as a result of increased emissions
  in the stratosphere. At mid-latitudes, a 1-km flight-level increase causes a
  moderate reduction of contrail cover because of increased flights in the dry
  stratosphere (e.g., 12% less contrail cover over the North Atlantic compared
  with the nominal-altitude cover). Despite these changes, the global change in
  contrail cover from an altitude increase is small because of compensating changes
  in the tropics. The stronger increase of contrail cover in the tropics may cause
  a stronger positive radiative forcing because of the warmer surface in the tropics
  compared with mid-latitudes (see <a href="040.htm#tab37">Table 3-7</a>). A reduction
  in flight levels generally has the opposite effect (more contrails at high latitudes
  and fewer contrails in the tropics). Results for Europe and parts of the United
  States of America are different in that computed contrail coverage decreases
  slightly for both an increase and a decrease in mean flight levels because air
  traffic currently occurs in the cold and humid upper troposphere in those regions,
  and a shift toward the drier stratosphere or the warmer mid-troposphere reduces
  contrail coverage (Sausen et al., 1998). A change in mean altitude of contrails
  may change their radiative impact even for constant areal coverage. A contrail
  at higher altitude in the troposphere will likely contain less ice mass and
  produce less radiative forcing, therefore, despite lower ambient temperatures
  (see <a href="040.htm#tab37">Table 3-7</a>). </p>
<p>Trends in soot emissions would be important if soot influences ice particle
  formation (see <a href="038.htm">Section 3.4</a>) or the chemistry of ozone
  (see <a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>). A soot mass emission index of 0.5 to
  1 g kg<sup>-1</sup> (and larger) is not uncommon for older aircraft engines. The soot mass
  emission index of the present aircraft fleet is estimated as 0.04 g kg<sup>-1</sup> (see
  <a href="088.htm">Chapter 7</a>). The soot emission index decreased with new
  engine technology until about 1980 but has showed no significant trend thereafter
  (Döpelheuer, 1997). The mass of soot emitted may decrease despite increases
  in fuel consumption. No data exist on trends for the number and surface area
  of soot aerosol emissions. </p>
<p>Atmospheric models and fuel consumption scenarios suggest that aircraft emissions
  contribute little to the tropospheric mass of sulfate and soot aerosol in today's
  atmosphere and in 2050 (see <a href="036.htm">Section 3.3</a>). However, aircraft-induced
  particles will increase with growing emission rates of condensable sulfur compounds
  and soot particle mass. A reduction in fuel sulfur content is not to be expected
  for the near future (see <a href="088.htm">Chapter 7</a>). The fraction of
  condensable sulfur compounds formed from fuel-sulfur depends on the details
  of the chemistry between the combustor and the engine exit (Brown et al., 1996a;
  Lukachko et al., 1998). The dependence of this fraction on expected changes
  in engine technology is not known (see <a href="088.htm">Chapter 7</a>). </p>
<p>Engines burning liquid hydrogen (liquid methane) instead of kerosene (Wulff
  and Hourmouziadis, 1997) emit 2.6 (1.5) times more water vapor for the same
  amount of combustion heat. Therefore, such engines trigger contrails at about
  1 to 2 km lower altitude (4 to 10 K higher ambient temperature) than comparable
  kerosene engines. Therefore, an increase in contrail coverage is expected with
  such fuels. Because of larger water emissions, such contrails will grow to larger
  diameters before evaporating in ice-subsaturated ambient air. On the other hand,
  aircraft using hydrogen (methane) fuels will emit no (little) soot and sulfur
  compounds, hence may cause contrails that have fewer and larger ice particles,
  smaller optical thickness, and a lesser impact on radiative fluxes (Schumann,
  1996a) (compare <a href="040.htm#tab37">Table 3-7</a>). </p>
<h3><i><b><a name="373"></a>3.7.3. Expected Changes for Supersonic Aircraft </b></i></h3>
<p>The expected emissions of future high speed civil transports (HSCTs) flying 
  above 16-km altitude would substantially add to aerosol amounts in the stratosphere. 
  A fleet of 500 HSCTs is expected to consume about 72 Tg fuel yr<sup>-1</sup> 
  in 2015 (Baughcum and Henderson, 1998). This level of consumption will cause 
  emissions of sulfur and soot of 14.4 and 2.9 Gg yr<sup>-1</sup>, for emission 
  indices of 0.2 g S kg<sup>-1</sup> and 0.04 g soot kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. 
  Microphysical calculations by the AER 2-D model (Weisenstein et al., 1997) show 
  that 28 Gg of sulfate will accumulate in the global atmosphere, assuming that 
  10% of sulfur emissions are converted in the plume to new particles with a radius 
  of 10 nm. The globally averaged aircraft-produced sulfate column is equal to 
  5.4 ng SO4 cm<sup>-2</sup>, with a maximum of 13.6 ng SO4 cm<sup>-2</sup> near 
  50°N. This value is about twice that computed for present subsonic aviation 
  (<a href="036.htm#tab34">Table 3-4</a>). The annually and zonally averaged perturbation 
  of sulfate aerosol SAD as shown in <a href="041.htm#img325">Figure 3-25</a> is 
  used for scenario SA5 in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> and in calculations 
  in Chapters <a href="054.htm">5</a> and <a href="063.htm">6</a>. The chemical 
  consequences of these SAD changes are discussed in detail in <a href="050.htm">Section 
  4.3.3</a>. Though supersonic aircraft may have better engine efficiency than 
  subsonic aircraft (0.38 for the Concorde), supersonic aircraft are expected 
  to form few persistent contrails because the probability of ice-supersaturated 
  air at cruise altitudes is small, except in the polar regions and near the tropical 
  tropopause (Miake-Lye et al., 1993). However, the accumulation of supersonic 
  aircraft emissions in the polar atmospheres and local H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, 
  HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>, and aerosol concentration increases in 
  aircraft plumes may enhance the occurrence of polar stratospheric clouds. The 
  impact on tropospheric cloud formation of supersonic aircraft cruising in the 
  stratosphere is very likely much smaller than the impact of major volcanic events. 
</p>
<h3><i><b><a name="374"></a>3.7.4. Mitigation Options </b></i></h3>
<p>In the following discussion, options related to aircraft and aircraft operations
  are briefly considered for the reduction of volatile and nonvolatile particle
  emission and formation and for the reduction of contrail formation and contrail
  impact. </p>
<p>Volatile particle growth is controlled mainly by oxidized sulfur, chemi-ions,
  and water vapor present in aircraft exhaust. With current engines and fuels,
  no practical options exist to reduce water vapor emission indices. The oxidation
  of sulfur depends on the emission of SO<span class="subscript">3</span> or the formation of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> in the engine
  and plume. The emission of SO<span class="subscript">3</span> depends on the details of the reactive flow in
  and beyond the engine combustion chambers (<a href="088.htm">Chapter 7</a>).
  The processes controlling condensable sulfur oxides and chemi-ion production
  are not yet sufficiently understood for a meaningful assessment of mitigation
  options. A reduction of sulfur content in fuel reduces plume levels of SO<span class="subscript">3</span> and
  H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>, but not necessarily by the same factor (Brown et al., 1996a). In addition,
  for low fuel sulfur content, volatile particles may remain that result from
  the emissions of other condensable material (Yu et al., 1998; see <a href="034.htm">Section
  3.2</a>) and thus require separate mitigation strategies. </p>
<p>Options to reduce soot emissions require changes in the combustion process
  (<a href="088.htm">Chapter 7</a>). Soot may be activated by H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> and possibly
  other exhaust species. If soot activation by H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> is to be avoided, fuel sulfur
  contents of less than 10 ppm would be required. </p>
<p>Simulations suggest that contrails would form even without any soot and sulfur
  emissions by activation and freezing of background particles (Jensen et al.,
  1998b; Kärcher et al., 1998a). Hence, the formation of contrails cannot be avoided
  completely by reducing exhaust aerosol emissions. Contrails formed in plumes
  with fewer exhaust particles are likely to be composed of fewer and larger particles,
  have smaller optical depths (Schumann, 1996a), hence cause less radiative forcing.
  Reduced soot and sulfate particle emissions may also lead to the formation of
  cirrus clouds with fewer but larger particles and less radiative forcing. </p>
<p>An increase in engine efficiency may change the global effects of contrails.
  Improvements in engine efficiency measured as specific fuel consumption (SFC)
  per unit thrust or overall efficiency, h, would reduce fuel consumption at cruise
  altitudes for a given amount of air traffic. Because more efficient engines
  increase the altitude range over which persistent contrails form (see <a href="035.htm#3241">Section
  3.2.4.1</a> and <a href="041.htm#372">3.7.2</a>), contrail frequency and cover would likely increase for
  a given air traffic amount. On the other hand, the number of ice crystals forming
  per aircraft-km would likely be reduced for lower SFC because aerosol and aerosol
  precursor emissions would be reduced. Fewer ice crystals could result in less
  radiative impact for a given amount of air traffic in altitude regions where
  contrails form at present. Hence, the balance of changes in contrail occurrence
  and the radiative impact that would result from changes in engine efficiency
  depend on a variety of factors, not all of which are well known enough at present.
</p>
<p>Reducing the frequency of contrails for a given amount of air traffic could
  otherwise be effected by reducing the number of flights in the humid and cold
  regions of the upper and middle troposphere. Numerical weather prediction schemes
  may be used to predict and circumvent such regions on long-distance flights.
  Contrail-forming regions could also be avoided by flying at generally higher
  altitudes, but the climatic impact of contrails may not be reduced because of
  counteracting effects. For example, higher flight altitudes at low latitudes
  could increase contrails, possibly causing a net increase instead of a decrease
  in global radiative forcing by contrails. In addition, more flights in the lower
  stratosphere could result in enhanced aerosol and chemical impacts not related
  to contrails. </p>
