<h2><b>5.4. Calculated Impact of Aviation on UV at the Surface of the Earth </b></h2>
<p>Present and future fleets of aircraft have the capacity to modify the amount
  of UV arriving at the surface of the Earth as a result of changes brought about
  by: </p>
<ul>
  <p>The amount and distribution of ozone in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere<br>
    The amount of cloud cover <br>
    The aerosol type, content, and distribution. </p>
</ul
>
<p>This section discusses the expected magnitudes of the effects of each of these
  changes and compares the calculated impact of aviation on UV at the ground with
  that resulting from other changes in the composition of the atmosphere.
<p>Many of the results discussed in this section are expressed in terms of percent
  change in UVery between two scenarios being compared. The relationships between
  UVery, the erythemal weighting factor, the ground-level irradiance, and the
  erythemally weighted irradiance are illustrated in <a href="058.htm#img51">Figure
  5-1</a> for 30°N for July and January.
<p>So that percent change in UVery may be put in context in terms of absolute
  irradiance, <a href="058.htm#img52">Figure 5-2</a> shows the calculated spatial
  and seasonal variation of the absolute value for UVery with latitude for the
  1992 background atmosphere.

<p>The underlying principle for the methodology described below is that calculations
  of ozone changes derived from chemical transport models should be related to
  measurements. For this chapter, calculations designed to determine ozone changes
  for the present and the future have been related to present-day measurements
  of ozone columns and profiles. Model calculations are then used to estimate
  the impact of aviation in 1970, 1992, 2015, and 2050. The modeled impacts are
  compared with other changes that are calculated to have occurred to ozone columns
  since 1970 and predicted to occur between 1992 and 2050. The radiative transfer
  calculations reported in this chapter were performed using a stand-alone version
  of the solar radiation module from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
  Research Organisation (CSIRO) 2-D chemical transport model (CTM), which has
  been described in Stolarski et al. (1995) and Randeniya et al. (1997). The method
  of Meier et al. (1982) is used to account for the effects of multiple scattering,
  and ray-tracing techniques are used to account for the curvature of the Earth.
  The CSIRO radiative transfer model participated in the photolysis benchmark
  intercomparison conducted as part of the 1995 Atmospheric Effects of Stratospheric
  Aircraft (AESA) assessment (Stolarski et al., 1995), and excellent agreement
  was obtained with the benchmark calculations. Intercomparisons have also been
  performed with the Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible (TUV) model developed
  by Madronich using calculations made at the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics
  at the University of Thessaloniki. The radiative transfer equation in TUV was
  solved by using the discrete ordinate radiative transfer (DISORT) code in 16-stream
  mode (Stamnes et al., 1988). Erythemally weighted fluxes were calculated at
  the ground under clear-sky conditions for zenith angles from 0 to 80°. Using
  the same input parameters, agreement was obtained with the CSIRO model to within
  2-3% for zenith angles up to 60° and within 5% for a zenith angle of 80°.

<p>The calculations address the effect of aviation on UV at the surface in 1970,
  1992, 2015, and 2050. For the years 2015 and 2050, there will be a range of
  scenarios that will be influenced primarily by the expected size and composition
  of the fleets and the amount and composition of emissions. In principle, however,
  the UV calculations require a representation of a background atmosphere and
  an atmosphere that includes the effects of aircraft emissions for each of the
  years 1970, 1992, 2015, and 2050. The term "background" in this context refers
  to an atmosphere derived from a calculation that includes all expected inputs
  other than those attributable to aircraft emissions. The calculated impacts
  of aviation on ozone for 1992, 2015, and 2050 are provided by <a href="044.htm">Chapter
  4</a>. The small effect calculated for 1970 is deduced from the 1992 calculations,
  as discussed in <a href="059.htm#5412">Section 5.4.1.2</a>.
<p>The starting point for subsequent calculations is the representation of ozone
  columns and profiles for 1992. For this chapter, the columns have been derived
  from archived TOMS version 7 measurements (Herman et al., 1996). UV calculations
  have been performed at local noon for January, April, July, and October at the
  following latitudes: 65°S, 45°S, 30°S, 0, 30°N, 45°N, and 65°N. The monthly
  averaged and zonally averaged ozone columns derived from the TOMS data for these
  months and latitudes for the 10-year period 1983 to 1992 are shown in <a href="059.htm#tab51">Table
  5-1</a>. 
<p>Because the values shown in <a href="059.htm#tab51">Table 5-1</a> are averages
  of measured values, they already include the effects of present-day aircraft
  emissions on ozone. In other words, to obtain the 1992 background atmosphere,
  the effects of emissions from aircraft have to be removed from the values shown
  in <a href="059.htm#tab51">Table 5-1</a>. The manner in which this has been
  done for these calculations and the extension of the methods applied to obtain
  the required information for the years 1970, 2015, and 2050 are illustrated
  in <a href="059.htm#img53">Figure 5-3</a>.</p>
  All calculations ultimately have averaged values for ozone given in <a href="059.htm#tab51">Table
  5-1</a> as their reference. These 1992 values are represented by 1992ss (where
  the subscript defines an atmosphere containing emissions from a fleet of subsonic
  aircraft) in <a href="059.htm#img53">Figure 5-3</a>. Chemical transport calculations
  are carried out to generate model atmospheres for 1992 that (a) do not include
  inputs attributable to aviation and (b) do include these inputs. Comparison
  of the results of these calculations allows one to determine the absolute differences
  in ozone concentrations predicted by the model.<br>

<p>These absolute differences are applied to 1992ss to produce 1992bg, the 1992
  background atmosphere, which is free of inputs from aircraft emissions. A model
  calculation is then carried out using the prescribed background scenario for
  2015. The results of these calculations are compared with the similar calculation
  for 1992, and the absolute difference obtained from the model calculations is
  applied to 1992bg to obtain 2015bg, the 2015 background atmosphere. Comparison
  of a model calculation for a 2015 atmosphere that contains inputs attributable
  to aviation, assuming only subsonic aircraft will be operating, with the model
  calculation for the 2015 background atmosphere provides an estimate of absolute
  changes in ozone concentration between these two calculations. These differences
  are applied to 2015bg to produce 2015ss, the 2015 atmosphere that includes the
  effects of emissions from a purely subsonic fleet of aircraft. Clearly, an analogous
  approach can be adopted to obtain the required information for 2050 and for
  1970. <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> has provided mixing ratio differences
  calculated for the impact of aviation on ozone profiles for the latitudes and
  seasons shown in <a href="059.htm#tab51">Table 5-1</a>. The authors of <a href="044.htm">Chapter
  4</a> chose results from the Oslo 3-D model and the Atmospheric and Environmental
  Research, Inc. (AER) 2-D model as representative of the subsonic and supersonic
  scenario calculations, respectively. <a href="059.htm#tab52">Table 5-2</a> shows
  the scenarios considered here, with references to the relevant <a href="044.htm">Chapter
  4</a> tables. The method adopted in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> for expressing
  the range in uncertainties for the ozone mixing ratio differences is discussed
  in <a href="060.htm#5423">Section 5.4.2.3</a>. <a href="059.htm#img53">Figure 5-3</a>
  attempts to highlight the fact that, although 1992bg, 2015bg, and 2015ss are
  derived from model calculations, they have the measurements of 1992ss as a reference.
  The implication of this approach is that, although ozone concentrations derived
  from models clearly have uncertainties, the differences obtained between any
  two model calculations may be more accurate than the absolute concentrations
  in either model calculation. This assumption is questionable and must be regarded
  more as an assumption that allows UV calculations to proceed than one that can
  be defended strongly. The approach does have the advantage that UV calculations
  derived from 1992bg, 2015bg, and 2015ss are not based entirely on model calculations.
  It should be noted that, in assigning differences between model calculations
  to measured values in 1992ss, absolute differences in model calculations have
  been chosen rather than percentage differences. Again, the approach taken cannot
  be defended rigorously. Examination of the 3-D CTM results in <a href="044.htm">Chapter
  4</a> shows a very wide variation in the range of models for estimated ozone
  differences in the upper troposphere. Arguments can be advanced for adopting
  either absolute or percentage changes to apply to measured ozone columns; until
  the reasons for the variations in the range of models are clear, however, neither
  approach is clearly superior to the other.</p>
<p>The current limitations of multidimensional CTMs generate additional complications
  that must be addressed in assessing the impacts of aviation on the composition
  of the atmosphere. The impact of subsonic fleets on ozone, for the present and
  for 2015 and 2050, has been discussed in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>, based
  on a range of 3-D CTMs. In their present state, these predominantly tropospheric
  models are unable to take into account adequately changes in the chemistry of
  the stratosphere. Between 1992 and 2050, for example, these changes would be
  induced predominantly by changes in the concentrations of inorganic chlorine
  and bromine compounds in the stratosphere. If the principal concern were to
  evaluate the impact of aviation on ozone for a given year, these limitations
  would not be too severe. However, if in addition one wishes to compare the effects
  of aircraft emissions with those that can be attributed to changes in stratospheric
  processes over the period 1970 to 2050, then one requires more information than
  current 3-D CTMs can supply. Furthermore, it is expected that future fleets
  may contain a supersonic component. These supersonic aircraft will fly in the
  stratosphere; to calculate the effects of this hybrid subsonic/supersonic fleet,
  models capable of assessing stratospheric changes must be used.
<p>Calculations of the effects of the hybrid subsonic/supersonic fleets were carried
  out in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> in the following way. For a given year
  (2015 for example), a 3-D CTM calculation using the Oslo model was performed
  to determine the change in ozone concentration for the subsonic fleet relative
  to the background atmosphere for that year. A 2-D calculation was then carried
  out with the AER 2-D model to determine the change in mixing ratio for ozone
  between the hybrid fleet and subsonic-only fleet scenarios. For the latitudes
  and seasons shown in <a href="059.htm#tab51">Table 5-1</a>, these mixing ratio
  differences were added to the mixing ratio differences, calculated by the Oslo
  3-D CTM, between the subsonic fleet and the background atmosphere. The scenarios
  used in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a> to provide the ozone differences for
  the subsonic impact were (A,B, 1992), (C,D, 2015), and (E,F, 2050), as defined
  in <a href="047.htm#tab44">Table 4-4</a>. The hybrid fleet impacts were obtained
  by comparing scenario S1k, defined in <a href="049.htm#tab411">Table 4-11</a>,
  with scenario D of <a href="049.htm#tab410">Table 4-10</a> for 2015 and scenario
  S9h, defined in <a href="049.htm#tab411">Table 4-11</a>, with scenario D9 from
  <a href="049.htm#tab410">Table 4-10</a> for 2050. Results from these sets of
  scenarios correspond to the calculated impacts of 500 HSCTs in 2015 and 1,000
  HSCTs in 2050.

<p>Calculations designed to show the effects of aviation relative to changes in

  given in <a href="068.htm#tab63">Table 6.3</a> of WMO (1994). It is clear from 
  the top panel that the 3-D CTM does not provide any information about changes 
  occurring in the atmosphere above about 18 km for the period from 1970 to 2050. 
  The calculated increases for ozone shown below 18 km and 
<p><i><a name="5412"></a></i>
<p>reaching peak values in the lower troposphere result from increased surface
  emissions, predominantly NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, that are expected to occur over this time period.
  The calculations reported in the middle panel show quite different behavior.
  In this set of 2-D calculations, surface emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> were not increased
  between 1970 and 2050. The changes in ozone concentrations shown in this panel
  are directly attributable to expected changes in concentrations of inorganic
  chlorine and bromine compounds, as well as those for nitrous oxide.</p>
<p>The bottom panel in <a href="059.htm#img54">Figure 5-4</a> shows the result of
  the linear combination of the concentration changes calculated in the top and
  middle panels. Results such as those in the bottom panel are then used to derive
  the background atmospheres for 1970, 2015, and 2050 from the background atmosphere
  used for 1992. The procedure of combining the results of 3-D and 2-D CTM calculations
  in this manner is clearly questionable, but at the present stage of model development
  this compromise is necessary. <a name="img55"></a>
<h4><i><a name="5412"></a>5.4.1.2. Method for Referring Calculated Changes to
  1970 </i> </h4>
<p>As discussed elsewhere in this chapter, the calculated impact of aviation on
  UV is to be compared with impacts on UV resulting from changes in atmospheric
  composition from other sources. For this purpose, 1970 has been taken as the
  reference year because it represents a period before the expected onset of substantial
  changes in the concentration of stratospheric ozone resulting from increases
  in the concentrations of stratospheric chlorine and bromine. The required ozone
  columns for 1970 have been obtained in the following manner: It is assumed that
  the amount of ozone in the lower troposphere of the background atmosphere has
  not changed between 1970 and 1992. Just as for 2015 and 2050, a 2-D calculation
  is performed to derive the 1970 background columns from corresponding values
  for 1992. As explained in <a href="059.htm#5411">Section 5.4.1.1</a>, the background
  surface concentrations used for the 1970 calculation are those given in <a href="068.htm#tab63">Table
  6.3</a> of WMO (1994). It is further assumed that changes in tropospheric ozone
  due to aviation between 1970 and 1992 are proportional to the amount of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  emitted. The amount of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emitted by aviation in 1970 is deduced from a linear
  extrapolation of the values given in <a href="135.htm#tab94">Table 9-4</a>; this
  amount is estimated to be 0.72 Tg.<br>
