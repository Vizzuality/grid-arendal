<p>Modeling results (Brown et al., 1996; Lukachko et al., 1998) and, for SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O,
  initial measurements (Arnold et al., 1992, 1994, 1999; Fahey et al., 1995a,b;
  Miake-Lye et al., 1998) indicate that significant changes in the levels of these
  species are possible as their source gases are oxidized. These changes can be
  important with respect to atmospheric impact (see <a href="020.htm">Chapters
  2</a> and <a href="031.htm">3</a>). However, most of the important chemical
  and fluid-mechanical effects remain unexplored. It is known, however, that strong
  non-linearities in the chemistry (based on as-yet unvalidated chemical models)
  can be accentuated by complex fluid-mechanical effects such as those associated
  with viscous boundary layersand wakes and blade cooling (Lukachko et al., 1998).
  <a href="104.htm#img727">Figure 7-27</a> shows an example of this process: Two
  different modeling results are compared for a single blade row such as that
  shown in <a href="103.htm#img724">Figure 7-24</a>. The first modeling result
  takes account of spatial temperature nonuniformity associated with blade cooling,
  whereas the second is an averaged, one-dimensional representation of the flow
  path. SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O oxidation in the blade row is enhanced when blade cooling is modeled.
</p>
<p>Changes in many secondary combustion species from presumably negligible levels
  after leaving the combustor cannot yet be predicted with sufficientaccuracy
  for assessment needs (Dryer et al., 1993; Miake-Lye et al., 1998). The existing
  experimental database for these species is insufficient to validate or improve
  current model predictions. For example, although models and initial measurements
  suggest that significant oxidation of SO<span class="subscript">2</span> to SO<span class="subscript">3</span> occurs within the engine, the
  models do not correctly predict the variation in the fraction of sulfur oxidized
  as fuel sulfur level is changed-suggesting that an unknown oxidative mechanism
  may be involved (Schumann et al., 1996; Danilin et al., 1997; Kï¿½rcher and Fahey,
  1997; Miake-Lye et al., 1998). Thus, current understanding is not mature enough
  to provide accurate initial conditions for aerosol formation models and subsequent
  atmospheric modeling downstream of the engine exit.</p>
<h4>7.6.4.4. Reactive Species (O, OH, HO<span class="subscript">2</span>, SO, H<span class="subscript">2</span>, H, N, CH) <a name="7644"></a></h4>
<p>Current chemical models assume the radicals N and CH to be negligible for current
  technology engines, and their influence on the course of post-combustion chemistry
  has been ignored. The validity of this assumption has not been assessed, however,
  and as combustion temperatures increase in future engines these constituents
  (as well as the others) may become more important. O and OH are considered to
  be the dominant oxidizing species within current modeling assumptions (HO<span class="subscript">2</span> levels
  remain less important), and orders of magnitude change are possible in these
  reactive species throughout the turbine and nozzle. Their evolution is very
  sensitive to chemical kinetics and species initialization at the combustor exit,
  and they are influenced by flow nonuniformities in the turbine and nozzle to
  a similar extent as the oxidation products. Prediction of their levels with
  sufficient accuracy for assessment needs is beyond currently validated capabilities,
  and the existing experimental database is insufficient to validate models. Furthermore,
  recent modeling studies (Yu and Turco, 1997, 1998) have implicated chemi-ions-a
  product of flame ionization in the combustor-as important in the growth of volatile
  particles after the exhaust leaves the engine. No measurements of ion levels
  at the engine exit have been identified; few measurements downstream of the
  exit exist (Arnold et al., 1994, 1999), and only simple estimates of the recombination
  inside the engine have been attempted to date, so the uncertainty in the emission
  levels of chemi-ions is very high.</p>
<p>Pressure and temperature and residence times change over relevant ranges of
  operating conditions and engine cycles, and the chemical processes are expected
  to change as a result. Generalizations regarding the exhaust constituents described
  above are not expected to change significantly over cruise conditions and even
  over the broader operating conditions representative of the landing/take-off
  cycle. However, changes in exit speciation are expected for the oxidative products
  and radical species that depend non-linearly on combustor exit concentrations
  and local conditions. Only limited research has been carried out on this topic
  (Hunter, 1982; Brown et al., 1996; Lukachko et al., 1998). </p>
<p><a href="105.htm#tab77">Table 7-7</a> provides a simplified status summary
  of the confidence attached to current modeling and measurements of emissions
  emerging from engines. Reducing uncertainties in the oxidation products of secondary
  species and in reactive species will require additional new measurements, as
  well as increased physical understanding of exhaust species oxidation in the
  turbine and nozzle. </p>
