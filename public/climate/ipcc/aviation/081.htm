<p>In <a href="072.htm">Sections 6.3</a> and <a href="078.htm">6.4</a> we have
  reported radiative forcing calculations for various aspects of aircraft-induced
  perturbations to radiatively active substances. One of the basic ideas behind
  this calculation was the validity of the concept of RF as a quantitative predictor
  for climate change (see <a href="070.htm#621">Section 6.2.1</a>). We implicitly
  assume that contributions from individual perturbations to the change in global
  mean surface temperature are additive, at least as a first-order approximation.
  The radiative forcing concept requires a quasi-constant climate sensitivity
  parameter l within the same model for different types of RF and different magnitudes
  of RF. This assumption holds for changes in most of the well-mixed greenhouse
  gases and for variations in solar irradiance (e.g., Hansen et al., 1984b; Shine
  et al., 1995; Hansen et al., 1997b; Roeckner et al., 1999). As noted in previous
  IPCC reports (e.g., IPCC, 1996), there are limitations to the applicability
  of the radiative forcing concept, especially for RFs that are highly variable
  geographically or seasonally (i.e., typical of aircraft perturbations). </p>
<p>As a clear example of large spatial differences in radiative forcing, the annual
  mean radiative imbalance as a function of latitude is shown in <a href="081.htm#img69">Figure
  6-9</a> for the big four RFs for subsonic aviation in 1992. Whereas the radiative
  imbalances from CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font> (positive) and CH<font size="-2">4</font>
  (negative) are nearly uniform from south pole to north pole, those from O<font size="-2">3</font>
  (peaking at 0.065 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> at 30�N) and contrails (peaking
  at 0.10 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> at 40�N) are highly concentrated in northern
  mid-latitudes. The global means of all four contributions are about equal (see
  <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table 6-1</a>). The NO<font size="-2">x</font>-driven
  perturbations to O<font size="-2">3</font> and CH<font size="-2">4</font> produce
  RFs (+0.23 and -0.14 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>, respectively) that are of
  similar magnitude and in part cancel. However, the latitudinal distribution
  of the radiative imbalance from these two perturbations does not cancel: The
  combined O<font size="-2">3</font>+CH<font size="-2">4</font> forcing is positive
  in the Northern Hemisphere and negative in the Southern Hemisphere. The response
  of the climate system to such geographically non-homogeneous forcing is unknown.
  At least regional differences in climate response can be expected, and there
  may even be differences in the global mean response (see <a href="082.htm">Section
  6.5.2</a>). </p>
<p>The limitations and advantages of the radiative forcing concept have recently
  been demonstrated by Hansen et al. (1997b). A classic test case considers radiative
  forcing and associated climate change for ozone perturbations occurring at different
  altitudes. In a series of numerical experiments with a low-resolution GCM (Hansen
  et al., 1997a), the impact of 100 DU ozone added to the various model layers
  was investigated. As in the calculations of Lacis et al. (1990), Hauglustaine
  and Granier (1995), Forster and Shine (1997), and Brasseur et al. (1998), strong
  variation of radiative forcing with the altitude of ozone perturbation is found:
  negative forcing for perturbation in the middle stratosphere, and positive forcing
  for perturbation in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. RF is a maximum
  for a perturbation close to the tropopause (<a href="081.htm#img610">Figure
  6-10</a>, dotted curve). </p>
<p>Without cloud and water vapor feedbacks, the change in global-mean surface
  air temperature exhibits a similar dependency on the altitude of the ozone perturbation
  as radiative forcing does (with a maximum close to the tropopause, not shown
  in figure). However, when all model feedbacks are included, the maximum global-mean
  surface temperature change in the GISS model occurs for an ozone perturbation
  in the middle troposphere (<a href="081.htm#img610">Figure 6-10</a>, dashed
  line). The climate sensitivity parameter l varies widely as a function of the
  altitude of the ozone perturbation varies widely from the middle stratosphere
  to the surface layer (<a href="081.htm#img610">Figure 6-10</a>, solid line).
  Peak sensitivity in this model occurs in the lower troposphere because of feedbacks
  on clouds. However, for the altitude range at which aircraft O<font size="-2">3</font>
  perturbations contribute significantly to the total RF (e.g., 2-14 km), the
  value of l is within a factor of 2 of the climate sensitivity parameter for
  doubling of CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font> in the same model, 0.92 K/(W m<font size="-1">-2</font>)
  (Hansen et al., 1997b). </p>
<p>In GCM experiments with a similar model that focused on aircraft-like perturbations,
  the specific feedbacks that minimized the response for aircraft releases were
  high-level cloud cover (Rind and Lonergan, 1995-considering ozone impacts) and
  sea ice (Rind et al., 1996-considering water vapor releases). Sensitivity of
  l to layered perturbations is also found by Ponater et al. (1998) but with opposite
  sense: The climate sensitivity parameter for aircraft-induced ozone is higher
  than that for well-mixed greenhouse gases. The difference in these results likely
  depends on the formulation of clouds within the two models. </p>
  With our present understanding of climate modeling and critical feedback processes
  in the troposphere, we can do no better than adopt the tropopause value of RF
  after stratospheric adjustment. However, for aircraft-induced climate perturbations,
  the additivity of RFs across all perturbations cannot be taken for granted and
  adds further uncertainty. <br>
