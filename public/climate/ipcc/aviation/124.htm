<h2>8.3. Other Operational Factors to Reduce Emissions </h2>
<p>From an environmental viewpoint, efficiency of transportation ("mobility efficiency")
  can be described as the fuel required to transport one person over a distance
  of 1 kilometer-the energy required per passenger-km. Comparison of freight hauling
  by aircraft to other modes of freight transportation is more complex because
  of differences in modes, such as weight restrictions. If various restrictions
  to the analysis are assumed and stated, freight may be compared on the basis
  of energy use per tonne-km. Because of these complexities and the requirements
  of various assumptions, this chapter concentrates on comparisons of passenger
  mobility. </p>

<p>The potential to improve the mobility efficiency of air transport is discussed
  in <a href="124.htm#831">Section 8.3.1</a>. The consequences for the aviation
  transportation system of avoiding specific areas at particular times and at
  particular altitudes and the resultant impact on fuel consumption are described
  in <a href="125.htm">Section 8.3.2</a>. <a href="126.htm">Section 8.3.3</a>
  compares CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions from various transport modes. <a href="127.htm">Section
  8.3.4</a> then discusses ground-based, aircraft-related emissions. <a href="127.htm#835">Section
  8.3.5</a> provides concluding remarks. </p>
<h3><a name="831"></a>8.3.1. Aircraft Performance </h3>
<p>This section describes potential reduction of fuel consumption by optimizing
  the operational use of an aircraft. Issues discussed include improving aircraft
  capacity utilization, reducing the operational weight of an aircraft, and optimizing
  the speed of an aircraft. In general, however, these variables have already
  been optimized by airlines, largely because of economic pressures and the requirement
  within the industry to minimize operational costs. </p>
<h4><a name="8311"></a>8.3.1.1. Aircraft Capacity Utilization </h4>
<p>The energy required per passenger-km depends on the distance travelled and
  the load factor, where the load factor is defined as the ratio between the transported
  payload and the maximum payload. Increasing payload improves fuel efficiency,
  as illustrated by the effect of payload on fuel burn for a Tupolev-154 (see
  <a href="124.htm#tab83">Table 8-3</a>). The Tupolev-154 is an older aircraft
  with lower fuel efficiency than modern aircraft that is frequently used in the
  Eastern part of Europe and the former Soviet Union. The effect of load factor
  on fuel efficiency for modern aircraft is similar (see <a href="124.htm#tab84">Table
  8-4</a>); fuel efficiency of modern aircraft is greater at all payloads (<a href="124.htm#tab84">Table
  8-4</a> and <a href="126.htm">Section 8.3.3</a>). For a discussion of trends
  in fuel efficiency over different generations of aircraft and levels of technology,
  see <a href="088.htm">Chapter 7</a>. </p>

</table>
<p>Apart from load factor, aircraft type, and level of technology, the configuration
  of an aircraft (number of seats, distribution between seating and cargo capacity)
  also has an important influence on fuel burned per passenger-km. The configuration
  is determined by the airline in consultation with the aircraft manufacturer
  and can be altered during the aircraft's lifetime. It differs between airlines
  and is based on market considerations. An example is provided by the way Japan
  Airlines configures its Boeing 747-400 aircraft. The 747-400 in long-range full
  passenger configuration has 262 seats, whereas the 747-400D used in high-density
  local Asian service has 568 seats, even when used in similar lengths of flights
  (see <a href="124.htm#tab84">Table 8-4</a>). Seat configuration can also vary
  in smaller aircraft. For example, Tarom Romanian Air Transport operates BAC
  1-11 aircraft in configurations with 104 economy passengers or a combination
  of 12 business and 77 economy passengers. Tarom also operates Boeing 737-300s
  with the same operating weights with 12 business and 120 economy passengers
  or 20 business and 102 economy passengers. </p>
<p>Most calculations of the mobility efficiency of passenger aircraft do not take
  into account the cargo that is carried in aircraft used for scheduled passenger
  services. For example, in 1995 about 28% of tonne-km flown by British Airways
  operations consisted of freight (British Airways, 1998a), much of which was
  carried on passenger aircraft. The United States reported 33.9% for all types
  of passenger aircraft in 1996 (Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 1997). The
  1996 U.S. cargo load factor for freight carriers was reported to be 61.8% for
  all aircraft types. Although relatively little freight is carried on short-haul
  passenger service, the carriage of freight might be adding a significant penalty
  to the perceived mobility efficiency of passenger air transport for long-haul
  flights. </p>
<p>Optimization of aircraft configuration and load factors can result in reduced
  emissions. This conclusion is supported by data presented in Tables <a href="124.htm#tab83">8-3</a>
  and <a href="124.htm#tab84">8-4</a>. Airline economics dictate that costs, including fuel costs, be minimized,
  therefore that the load factor be optimized. As an illustration of the development
  of load factors for all domestic and international scheduled services, International
  Air Transport Association (IATA) statistics show an average 0.4% per annum increase
  in load factor over the past decade (IATA, 1996). These data are consistent
  with data in ICAO (1996), which showed an increase in load factor of 4% in a
  period of 10 years. However, it is unclear whether the load factor can continue
  to grow indefinitely without consequences to passenger service. Moreover, load
  factor and aircraft configuration are driven not only by the need for improved
  efficiency but also by market considerations. </p>
<p>The increase in demand for air travel is an important factor in aircraft capacity
  utilization. (<a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a> describes the main drivers for
  this increase.) A second important factor is the (further) development of the
  "hub and spoke" system in some parts of the world, such as the United States
  and Europe. Because transport efficiency is not always optimized by direct point-to-point
  travel, air travel has evolved from direct connections between major city pairs
  to a complex network that includes consolidation hubs. Costs are minimized by
  maximal use of single-sector, out-and-back operations. By combining these sectors
  in a hub-and-spoke network, an efficient multiplication of potential point-to-point
  markets served can be achieved. Use of the hub-and-spoke system results in greater
  distances than direct point-to-point flights; it can also result in fewer aircraft
  operations for the entire system. Any area of the world with, for example, 500
  airports will have about 250,000 potential point-to-point flights. For many
  pairs of airports, however, a direct flight will never occur except where demand
  makes direct routes economically viable. </p>
<p>Recent studies (e.g., Peterse and Boering, 1997) have suggested that apart
  from further intensification of the hub-and-spoke system, more point-to-point
  connections are likely to be introduced. This "hybrid" development arises for
  several reasons: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>. Two-engine aircraft built for extended twin operations (ETOPS) over water
    are available. <br>
    . Further segmentation of the air transport market. Business passengers are
    prepared to pay more for a direct connection instead of flying via hubs.<br>
    . Capacity problems at main hubs are likely to lead to growth at smaller,
    secondary hubs. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the introduction of ETOPS aircraft, a hybrid system will not necessarily
  result in a decrease of transport efficiency from an economic point of view.
</p>
<h4><a name="8312"></a>8.3.1.2. Aircraft Cruise Speed </h4>
<p>Historically, the speed of jet transport operations was set at a constant Mach
  number. The Mach number is defined as the ratio of an aircraft's speed to the
  local speed of sound. The local speed of sound varies with ambient static temperature,
  which generally decreases with altitude. The selected Mach number is based on
  overall time-variable costs, as well as fuel economy, which has always been
  a major component of operating costs. Thus, typical cruise speeds were Mach
  0.82 to 0.84 for first-generation jet aircraft such as the Boeing 707, Boeing
  727, or McDonnell Douglas DC-8 and 0.84 to 0.86 for early Boeing 747s. </p>
<a name="img81"></a>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" align="center">

    <td><img src="images/avf8-1.gif" width=548 height=408 alt="" border="0"> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Subsequently, a number of fuel-conscious airlines developed the concept of
  a long-range cruise (LRC) speed schedule, usually based on Mach number. LRC
  was introduced as a compromise between maximum speed and the speed that provides
  the highest mileage in terms of km per kg of fuel burned in cruise (maximum
  range cruise, or MRC speed), taking some account of costs associated with flight
  time. LRC is defined as the fastest speed at which cruise fuel mileage is 99%
  of fuel mileage at MRC. At the time LRC was introduced, it was not possible
  to fly at lower speeds, closer to MRC, because of the stability needs of the
  autothrottle and/or the autopilot. At speeds close to MRC, the autothrottle
  would continuously "hunt" which could give rise to an increase in fuel burn.
</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, fuel conservation was further enhanced by development of
  the performance management system (PMS) for aircraft such as the Boeing 737
  and 747 and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10. Later aircraft (such as most Airbus
  aircraft; the Boeing 757, 767, 747-400, and 777; and the McDonnell Douglas MD-11)
  included the flight management system (FMS) as a built-in feature. PMS or FMS
  computer systems can be used to minimize overall trip cost, which is a balance
  between fuel- and time-related costs. The most efficient cruise speed (ECON)
  can be calculated on a real-time basis by using the cost index facility on the
  system. With full-time autothrottle, late-model aircraft can fly between MRC
  and LRC to optimize fuel savings. </p>
<p><a href="124.htm#img81">Figure 8-1</a> shows the relationship between the difference
  in block time and the difference in fuel consumption for various cruise speed
  schedules-such as constant Mach number, LRC, MRC, or ECON-for the Boeing 747-400
  (block time is the time between engine start at the airport of origin and engine
  stop at the airport of destination; block fuel is the fuel burned in this time).
  Data in <a href="124.htm#img81">Figure 8-1</a> are consistent with those in
  Fransen and Peper (1993). The data presented in <a href="124.htm#img81">Figure
  8-1</a> suggest that reduction of fuel use by further speed optimization is
  likely to be small. </p>
<p>Bradshaw (1994) investigated the variation in block fuel and block time for
  Airbus aircraft. The report shows higher figures (up to 10%) for the potential
  reduction in fuel burn from reduction of cruise speed. However, the report also
  concludes that reduction of Mach number will involve penalties such as significant
  increase in block time and the subsequent effect on direct operating costs.
</p>
<h4><a name="8313"></a>8.3.1.3. Aircraft Weight Reduction </h4>
<p>A negative effect on the mobility efficiency of aircraft can be caused by additional
  non-essential weight. Additional weight is introduced if an aircraft takes more
  fuel onboard than that required by the fuel flight plan. Tankering is the term
  for loading of fuel used for subsequent flight segments. The main reasons for
  tankering of fuel are commercial-for example, in cases where the cost of fuel
  consumed in carrying additional fuel is more than offset by the difference in
  the price of fuel at the departure point and a destination where fuel could
  be loaded. Factors that can affect fuel costs and decisions on tankering include
  the following: </p>
<p>. Genuine high fuel costs because of expensive distribution infrastructure
  and local taxes <br>
  . Fuel availability at some remote airports <br>
  . Government-imposed fuel pricing (at some Eastern European airports, the price
  of aviation fuel is more than 50% more than at Western European airports) <br>
  . Monopoly distribution of fuel, which can involve cross-subsidies from large
  to small airports and expensive manpower practices <br>
  . Concern over fuel quality (e.g., water content) at particular locations <br>
  . Slot availability (where limited aircraft turnaround time allows insufficient
  time for refueling, an aircraft may have to tanker to minimize the risk of losing
  slots; problems in this area are exacerbated at congested airports, where there
  may be limitations in runway and/or terminal capacity). </p>
<p>Estimates from British Airways suggest that additional fuel burn as a result
  of tankering is on the order of 0.5% of total aircraft fuel consumption. </p>
<p>Apart from tankering, all commercial flights must carry a certain amount of
  additional fuel, often mandated by national legislation, for safety reasons.
  The minimum amount of fuel required for the planned route is calculated by taking
  into consideration the weather forecast, the route, the weight of the aircraft,
  and other factors (including an allowance for diversion to secondary destinations).
  In most cases, this calculation is carried out with a computerized database.
  The pilot is presented with a flight plan and the required amount of fuel, although
  the captain decides how much fuel is finally carried. The pilot may adjust the
  amount to be loaded in light of any exceptional circumstances and his or her
  own interpretation of the risk of diversion or likelihood of weather changes
  down the route. The amount of excess fuel carried for safety reasons is likely
  to be one to several thousand kg per flight. </p>
<p>Other factors that introduce additional weight are potable water and emergency
  equipment. Adjustment of the amount carried to the anticipated requirement,
  with a contingency allowance, could accomplish some fuel savings. The extent
  to which emergency equipment is carried varies from airline to airline and the
  nature of the flight. In addition, aircraft weight is increased by customer
  service considerations such as quality of seating, in-flight entertainment,
  and duty-free goods. </p>
<p>Although little quantitative data are available, such weight reduction could
  result in a potential fuel savings on the order of 1-2%. As described, only
  part of this potential reduction can be achieved. Hence, the potential reduction
  of total fuel burn from weight reduction is probably less than 1%. </p>
<h4><a name="8314"></a>8.3.1.4. Other Operational Issues </h4>
<p>During very rare emergency situations, it may be necessary to jettison fuel
  into the atmosphere to reduce the overall weight of an aircraft to a safe landing
  weight. The potential effects of this (relatively small amount of) jettisoned
  fuel are not described here. Chapters <a href="020.htm">2</a>, <a href="031.htm">3</a>,
  and <a href="063.htm">6</a> discuss the possible effects of emitting unburned
  aviation fuel into the atmosphere. </p>
<p>Emergencies requiring jettisoning of fuel are mainly mechanical in nature,
  such as serious engine malfunction, or airframe structural failure. Severe illness
  of passenger(s) is also a major cause of emergency landings. Jettisoning of
  fuel is largely confined to larger aircraft flying long-haul routes. For these
  aircraft, the maximum landing weight may be significantly lower than the maximum
  take-off weight (both specified through certification by the manufacturer).
  In the event of an emergency that requires fuel to be jettisoned, airline instructions,
  as specified in aircraft operating manuals, and local operating procedures call
  for the aircraft to climb to a specified altitude or to fly to designated fuel
  dumping areas away from centers of population. British Airways estimates that
  only a very small percentage (on the order of 0.01%) of fuel used by the aviation
  industry each year is jettisoned. This estimate is subject to major uncertainty,
  particularly with reference to the former Soviet Union, and does not take into
  account military operations. </p>
<p>Other potential fuel-reduction measures include reducing non-revenue flights
  and changing the loading distribution of passengers, cargo, and fuel to change
  the aircraft's center of gravity. However, such measures are not expected to
  have a significant impact. </p>
<h4><a name="8315"></a>8.3.1.5. Tradeoff between Noise and Emissions </h4>
<p>Apart from aircraft emissions, noise exposure around airports is also an environmental
  issue. The relationship between noise exposure and fuel efficiency sometimes
  involves a tradeoff. For example, the Aircraft Noise Design Effects Study (ANDES)
  concluded that ".a general rule of thumb is that a 3-decibel noise reduction
  at flyover (where the noise rewards are greatest) would, on average, increase
  fuel burn and hence emissions by some 5%." (ICCAIA, 1994). This figure applies
  to a new aircraft design; to achieve this reduction in noise at the other measuring
  points (approach and sideline), a higher fuel burn penalty is involved. For
  the same result to be achieved by modifying an existing design, the ANDES study
  concluded that the penalty would be greater. </p>
<p>One major area of potential impact is in retrofitting of engine equipment on
  older aircraft to conform with current aircraft noise standards. For example,
  it is possible to convert older, more noisy "<a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>"
  aircraft to comply with the tighter "<a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a>" noise
  standards that will be a requirement of all civil subsonic jet aircraft operating
  at airports in the United States in 2000 and in Europe and some other countries
  by 2002. Such a change is not possible for all "<a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>"
  aircraft. However, where it is possible, the increased weight of noise abatement
  equipment ("hushkits") can lead to an increase in fuel consumption of up to
  5%. The fuel increase depends on the type of hushkit used. A lightweight hushkit,
  with smaller improvements in noise reduction, may have a negligible effect on
  fuel consumption. In addition, for a very limited number of aircraft, there
  is a possibility of fitting modern, quiet, fuel efficient engines-but at higher
  cost because new engines generally are more costly than hushkits. </p>
<p>In addition, noise restrictions may cause flight paths, arrival paths, and
  departure paths to be longer than the shortest routings-resulting in increased
  fuel burn. Airport neighbors continue to lobby for noise reductions. Such noise
  mitigation measures that increase flight time and distance may include departures
  over bodies of water, selective runway use, routing around populated areas,
  and so forth. Agencies worldwide have implemented these types of noise control
  strategies. For example, in the United States, the FAA has defined 37 noise
  control strategy categories (Cline, 1986). Of these 37 categories, 25 could
  have a direct effect on aircraft operations at the airport. Some of the remaining
  12 categories could also have an indirect effect on aircraft operations. </p>
