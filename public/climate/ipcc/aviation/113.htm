<h2>7.10. Supersonic Transport Aircraft</h2>
<p>Supersonic transport aircraft are not new. In the 1960s and early 1970s, there
  were three major supersonic transport projects in Europe, the United States,
  and the Soviet Union. Only one of those projects, the Concorde, was completed
  and continues in revenue service-and only between Western Europe (London and
  Paris) and the eastern U.S. seaboard (New York and, until recently, Washington).
  Only 13 of these aircraft are in airline service, including charter operations
  and demonstration flights. The ground and flight operational acceptability for
  this type of aircraft has been demonstrated worldwide.</p>
<p>The life development of Concorde aircraft now suggests they could continue
  in service for an additional 10-15 years. The levels of exhaust emissions produced
  by Concorde's Olympus engines [EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) = 18]
  is higher than could be achieved now but is commensurate with the design knowledge
  of the 1960s. With a limited small fleet and an average aircraft utilization
  of 600 hours per year, these aircraft do not appear to constitute a major environmental
  concern, although they must be considered in aircraft fleet mix scenarios in
  view of the Concorde's higher cruising altitude. </p>
<p>The Concorde operates for passengers prepared to pay high fares. Improvements
  in materials, structural, and systems technology that are available or currently
  being developed could make a second generation of supersonic aircraft more widely
  affordable. Studies have concluded that an aircraft with between 250 and 300
  seats cruising at Mach 2 to 2.4 (at altitudes between 16 and 20 km) is most
  likely to be successful (Shaw et al., 1997). To make such aircraft effective
  for the long overseas routes that benefit most from the increased speed and
  maintain viability with regard to viewpoint of sonic booms, the projected range
  must be at least 8000 km (and possibly 10400 km). Studies have examined a wide
  range of speeds and concluded that speeds higher than Mach 2.4 offer little
  gain in block time, whereas they exacerbate airframe materials and propulsion
  problems, hence increase technical risk (Zurer, 1995). Prior projections concluded
  that aircraft with a cruise speed of Mach 2.0 to 2.4 were feasible for entry
  into service in 2005, and a hypersonic vehicle cruising at Mach 5 might enter
  service by about 2030 (Zurer, 1995). Events have shown that these projections
  were optimistic, and it is unlikely that a new Mach 2 to 2.4 vehicle will enter
  service much before 2015. By the same token, required research for the hypersonic
  vehicle and its economics would make entry into service of a hypersonic vehicle
  unlikely before 2050-and possibly later unless scheduling and airport curfews
  could be accommodated to demonstrate higher cruise speed benefits. Therefore,
  the focus of the remaining discussion is on vehicles cruising at speeds up to
  Mach 2.4. </p>
<p>The Concorde has already demonstrated the practicality of Mach 2.05 as an achievable
  cruise speed with aluminum alloys for the basic structure. For speeds above
  Mach 2.2, more exotic materials would be required including titanium alloys
  and organic composites for structural items and more complex air intakes. At
  speeds between Mach 2 and 2.4, airframe characteristics currently dictate cruise
  altitudes between 16 and 20 km. Optimization studies are planned to investigate
  lower cruise altitudes, recognizing the potential benefit of minimized ozone
  impact. To enable the inclusion of route segments over populated areas without
  sonic booms, an advanced supersonic airliner must also be capable of cruising
  efficiently in an environmentally acceptable manner at subsonic speeds and lower
  cruise altitudes. </p>

<p>The characteristics of potential second-generation supersonic transports and
  their consequent impact on the atmosphere differ substantially from those of
  subsonic transports. First among these differences is the cruise altitude in
  the stratosphere, which is near where ozone concentration peaks. For a given
  level of emissions, the supersonic transport's potential impact on the ozone
  column is larger than that of subsonic aircraft from an NO<span class="subscript">x</span>-ozone
  depletion perspective. This impact led to strong opposition to U.S. supersonic
  transport development in the 1970s and, together with the potential airport
  noise impact and economic considerations, led ultimately to cancellation of
  the development. There is now consensus that emissions from a second-generation
  supersonic transport must be limited to levels that will have a "negligible
  effect" on ozone. </p>
<p>There is also concern regarding the effects of carbon and sulfate-based particulates,
  and water vapor (Albritton et al., 1993; Stolarski et al., 1995). This subject
  is discussed in <a href="020.htm">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="031.htm">3</a>.
  Atmospheric modeling has indicated that the effects of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  are likely to be small for a fleet of 500 to 1,000 Mach 2-2.4 aircraft if EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)
  is near 5 g kg<sup>-1</sup>. This issue is discussed in detail in <a href="044.htm">Chapters
  4</a> through <a href="063.htm">6</a>. This level of emission has become a technology
  development target for the second generation supersonic transport. As yet there
  are no such targets for particulates, but such targets may emerge before the
  decision time for a production development program is reached. </p>
<p>The overall efficiencies of subsonic and supersonic propulsion systems at comparable
  technology levels are not very different. The lift/drag ratio of supersonic
  aircraft, however, is substantially lower than that of subsonics-no more than
  about 9 compared to about 20 for subsonics, as is shown in <a href="112.htm#img741">Figure
  7-41</a>. This lower ratio is related to losses caused by shock waves, which
  can be minimized but not eliminated by sophisticated designs. Thus, for the
  same range the supersonic transport must carry a larger fraction of its mass
  as fuel. For a given weight, its engines must also produce more thrust in cruise
  because of the larger drag. Primarily as a result of these effects, the fuel
  burn per passenger mile of a supersonic transport is correspondingly large-two
  or more times that of a subsonic transport. Nevertheless, economic studies that
  incorporate time zone/ productivity considerations indicate that the greater
  productivity resulting from shorter block times could enable the supersonic
  transport to compete with subsonic transports. There is no intent to further
  quantify this question here. The remaining sections address the technological
  challenges that set supersonic transport propulsion apart from those faced by
  advanced subsonic engines. </p>
<h3>7.10.2. Propulsion System Efficiency<a name="7102"></a></h3>
<p>This subject is covered in greater depth in <a href="095.htm">Section 7.4</a>,
  but the key points are reviewed here briefly with emphasis on supersonic aspects.
  Overall propulsion system efficiency may be regarded as the product of two factors:
  Thermal efficiency and propulsive efficiency. Thermal efficiency is the ratio
  of hot gas power produced by the engine gas generator to the power in the fuel
  flow. It is ideally controlled by the temperature ratio of the compression process-that
  is, the ratio of temperature at the discharge of the compressor to ambient temperature.
  In modern engines, the compressor discharge temperature is limited by the temperature
  tolerance of materials suitable for use in compressors, to a level of about
  850 to 900 K. Ambient temperature is nearly constant at about 220 K (although
  the temperature varies considerably even at the altitudes flown by supersonic
  transports). Thus, the temperature ratio is about 4, resulting in an ideal thermal
  efficiency of about 3/4. The actual efficiency is lower because of various losses
  but remains quite high. </p>
<p>Propulsion efficiency, which is the ratio of power pushing the airplane to
  the hot gas power produced by the gas generator, ideally depends only on the
  ratio of jet velocity to flight velocity. It can be increased toward the limit
  of unity by increasing the bypass ratio. The bypass ratio that is best for any
  given application is determined by a balance between the increased drag and
  weight associated with the larger engine frontal area needed for increased airflow
  and the increased propulsive efficiency associated with the larger airflow.
  There is an additional factor in fixing the bypass ratio-the fan pressure ratio.
  Engines for supersonic applications require a higher fan pressure ratio than
  subsonics for similar improvements in efficiency. When these compromises are
  struck for the subsonic and supersonic propulsive systems, the propulsive efficiencies
  of the two systems at cruise conditions are not very different. Over the past
  2 decades, the bypass ratios of subsonic engines have increased from 2 toward
  10 as lighter weight and aerodynamically more sophisticated designs have evolved.
  For supersonic propulsion systems, the cruise bypass ratio of choice is now
  in the range of 0.5-1.0, whereas for the Concorde and for the U.S. supersonic
  transport of the 1970s it was zero. </p>
<h3> 7.10.3. Supersonic Propulsion System Characteristics<a name="7103"></a></h3>
<p>In contrast to subsonic engines-in which the needs for low cruise fuel consumption
  and low take-off noise are synergistic in that they both favor high bypass ratio-supersonic
  engines face a severe conflict between the need for low bypass ratio in transsonic
  acceleration and cruise, and the need for higher bypass at take-off to limit
  jet noise. This conflicts leads to supersonic propulsion systems in which the
  effective bypass ratio can be small at cruise and relatively large at take-off.
  Such variation can be achieved by several different approaches, characterized
  at the extremes as variable turbomachinery systems and ejector nozzle systems.
  Common to all approaches is that the engine operates at a relatively high exhaust
  velocity at cruise and a low exhaust velocity at take-off. </p>
<p>The engine concept favored by the U.S. program is a low bypass turbofan (0.6)
  with a mixer-ejector nozzle for noise suppression at take-off. It is projected
  that a supersonic transport with this propulsion system could meet Federal Aviation
  Regulations 36 Stage 3 noise requirements. An alternative concept proposed by
  the European engine consortium has a fan at the midsection of the engine, fed
  by auxiliary inlets at take-off, to produce a bypass ratio of about 2 at take-off.
  The auxiliary inlets are closed and the fan airflow is decreased via a geometry
  change to give a lower bypass in cruise. This engine concept is estimated to
  meet the Stage 3 noise requirement with a conventional variable area nozzle
  such as that used on the Concorde. </p>
<p>For designs under current consideration, the compression pressure ratio is
  about 22 at take-off conditions, and the corresponding temperature rise is about
  500 K, producing a compressor outlet temperature of about 800 K. By comparison,
  a subsonic engine at take-off would have a pressure ratio of 35 with a compressor
  exit temperature of 900 K. At supersonic cruise, the compressor outlet temperature
  is limited by the materials to about 950 K. For a subsonic cruise engine with
  a pressure ratio of 40, the corresponding compressor outlet temperature is about
  850 K or lower, limited by practical aerodynamics. The consequence is that the
  supersonic engine runs hot at cruise and cool at take-off-the opposite of the
  subsonic engine. </p>
<h3>7.10.4. SST Propulsion NO<span class="subscript">x</span> Output<a name="7104"></a></h3>
<p>At cruise, subsonic engines have an overall pressure ratio, including inlet
  ram pressure rise, in the range of 35-50. The overall pressure ratio of a supersonic
  propulsion system, including the intake pressure rise and the remaining turbomachinery
  pressure ratio, is in the range of 130-140, calculated as a ratio of the compressor
  exit total pressure divided by the inlet static pressure. Whereas the conventional
  subsonic system might have EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) of 10-15 g
  kg<sup>-1</sup> fuel using a conventional combustor, even with the double annular system
  the advanced supersonic engine would barely achieve EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)
  of 30 (Lowrie, 1993). Combined with the cruise altitude in the high ozone concentration
  zone, this high NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission would not be acceptable
  for a supersonic transport. This problem is well recognized, and there are many
  research activities throughout the western world to develop ultra-low EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)
  systems. Although the combination of the 5g kg<sup>-1</sup> EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)
  goal and high compressor outlet temperatures may seem formidable, research programs
  have shown that because of the high altitude, the low absolute pressures in
  the supersonic transport combustors allow easier control of the combustion mixing
  process. Contemporary findings therefore support the likely achievement of this
  target (Shaw et al., 1997). </p>
<p>Supersonic transports will also be subject to LTO cycle emissions rules and
  potential climb/cruise emissions rules in common with other air traffic. In
  this respect, the lower combustor inlet temperatures and pressures experienced
  at take-off will mean that NO<span class="subscript">x</span> requirements in
  the airport neighborhood could be met more easily. The combustion system will
  be optimized for subsonic climb and cruise as well as supersonic cruise conditions,
  so attainment of low emissions still requires considerable effort. </p>
