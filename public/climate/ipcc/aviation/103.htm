<h4> 7.5.4.3. Longer-Term Technology</h4>
<p>Much of the longer term combustion research is now aimed at what is termed
  "ultra-low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> technology." This technology is defined as technology that produces
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels that are no more than 50% of the ICAO CAEP/2 standards. All major
  manufacturers of aircraft engines, with the sponsorship of associated government
  agencies, are currently pursuing combustor technologies aimed at reducing NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  emissions to these levels, under operating conditions typical of the next generation
  of engines. This approach entails pursuing technology that is relevant to engines
  with pressure ratios from current levels (ï¿½30 to 40) to future levels (above
  50). The aim is to reduce NO<span class="subscript">x</span> production in the vicinity of airports and at
  subsonic cruise conditions. Two key programs are aimed at large, subsonic, high-pressure
  ratio aircraft engines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>U.S. NASA Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) Program: Sequential NO<span class="subscript">x</span> goals
    of 50 and 70% reduction below CAEP/2 standards, with comparable reductions
    at subsonic cruise; engine SFC reduction of 8-10% over the most recent production
    engines by about 2010 </li>
  <li>EU-BRITE/EURAM Projects Low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> I,II,III: Goal of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reduction more than
    60% below CAEP/2; engine SFC reduction of 8-10% over the most recent production
    engines by about 2010.</li>

<p>These programs specify that there must be no compromise in performance, safety,
  or any other emissions parameters (smoke, CO, and HC).</p>
<p>Details of combustor technologies are commercially sensitive and are not openly
  available. However, three parallel strategies are being pursued. They vary in
  their NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reduction potential and their associated increase in complexity, cost,
  and development challenge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reductions in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels close to 50% of CAEP/2 standards are being sought
    through the optimization of current single-stage combustor technology. This
    approach involves further improvements in fuel injection uniformity, better
    fuel/air mixing, reduction in combustor liner coolant flow (making more air
    available for combustion), and decreases in hot gas residence time. Such changes
    would have minimum impact on engine cost of ownership. The first examples
    of this type of technology now exist in manufacturers' product plans for the
    next 5 to 10 years. </li>
  <li>Reductions in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels to 50-70% below CAEP/2 standards are being explored
    using multi ple burning zones in radial and axial configurations (<a href="102.htm#img723">Figure
    7-23</a>). These concepts permit local temperature and residence time in the
    combustor to be controlled and optimized at each engine operating condition,
    to minimize NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and other emittants (Bahr, 1992; Segalman et al., 1993). In
    low-power operations, a single stage is fueled and optimized for stability.
    At high-power conditions, one or both stages,configured for lean burning,
    are fueled. Generally, radial staged designs are shorter and lighter but larger
    in diameter, making it more difficult to achieve a uniform exit temperature
    profile at off-design conditions. They are also more difficult to cool. Axial
    staged systems are longer and have a larger number of fuel injectors. In both
    cases, the increased complexity and weight of these combustors is expected
    to increase the cost of ownership, as described by DuBell (1995). A major
    effort is needed to minimize the cost, complexity, weight, and performance
    of these concepts. Reduction in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels to 85-90% below CAEP/2 standards
    are focused on emissions from supersonic aircraft at cruise conditions. Such
    work presently forms part of the U.S. supersonic transport program. Combustors
    known as lean premixing prevaporizing (LPP) and rich burn quick quench (RBQQ)
    are being studied. In the former, the burning zone is fed with a lean and
    homogeneous fuel/air mixture. Premixing and prevaporizing takes place in a
    premix duct outside the combustor. The RBQQ combustor consists of three zones:
    A primary rich burning zone; a dilution zone, to rapidly reduce the rich mixture
    to a lean one without recirculating dilution air into the primary zone; and
    a lean reburning zone (DuBell, 1995). These combustors uniquely apply to the
    supersonic engine with its relatively low engine pressure ratio and its requirement
    for long periods at a single, high-speed cruise operating condition. Application
    of these concepts to future subsonic engines would pose special problems because
    of higher pressure ratios. For example, the LPP combustor will have to overcome
    the greater risk, at very high pressures, of "flashback" or upstream burning-which,
    if undetected, could damage the combustor. Similarly, the RBQQ combustor-with
    its high fuel concentration in the primary burning zone-may well result in
    the generation of large amounts of soot and smoke in high-pressure operations.
    However, some of the features found in these concepts may be suitable for
    higher pressure ratio subsonic engines. Partial premixing, coupled with moderately
    rich sector burning, represents one such concept. Multiple burning zones,
    together with variable geometry to control local fuel/air ratios, would be
    another. A concept incorporating several of these features (shown in <a href="102.htm#img723">Figure
    7-23b</a>) is being pursued under the European Union's Targeted Research Action
    "Efficient and Environmentally Friendly Aero-Engines." A radially staged configuration
    currently under "main" phase development (LOWNO<span class="subscript">x</span>III) combines an RBQQ candidate
    pilot injector with a premixing main zone injector. This concept might provide
    low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions with acceptable operational capabilities at LTO and cruise
    conditions of subsonic aircraft (Zarzalis et al., 1995). </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="755"></a>7.5.5. Future Technology Scenarios</h3>
<p>As part of the preliminary work associated with this report, industry was asked
  to consider what advances in technology might be applicable for aircraft in
  the year 2050. Numerous projections were made by an expert group from the aeronautical
  industry (engine, airframe, and aerospace manufacturers). The group provided
  their best judgments of fuel efficiency and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> technology scenarios for the
  year 2050 (ICCAIA, 1997f) to the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection
  Forecasting and Economic Support Group (FESG) for use in <a href="130.htm">Chapter
  9</a> of this report. The assumptions for the 2050 scenarios were as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Continued demand for worldwide commercial/regional/ general aviation aircraft
  </li>
  <li>Technology advancement to be addressed for all engine sizes </li>
  <li>Unrestricted kerosene availability</li>
  <li> Development time and operational life of modern aircraft = 40-50 years</li>
  <li> All airworthiness requirements achievable </li>
  <li>Economically viable</li>
  <li> No impact on noise </li>
  <li>Possible NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reduction scenarios. </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a> of this report considers the conclusions
  of the group in conjunction with FESG traffic scenario projections. Together,
  these considerations take account not only of long-term demand but also of fuel
  burn and emissions (see <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a>). The latter two depend
  on three factors: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Airframe technology developments (discussed in <a href="091.htm">Sections
    7.2</a> and <a href="093.htm">7.3</a>) </li>
  <li>Trends in engine design (discussed in <a href="095.htm">Section 7.4</a>)</li>
  <li> Combustion system development-in particular NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reduction scenarios, based
    in one case on the best near-term combustor technology and in the other on
    longer term NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reduction combustor technology (discussed in <a href="100.htm">Sections
    7.5.3</a> and <a href="101.htm">7.5.4</a>, respectively).</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefits arising from the first item influence projections in terms of
  fuel efficiency alone. The other two items take into account the net effects
  of cycle changes and emissions reductions strategies. Two potential long-term
  aircraft technology scenarios emerged from these deliberations. These scenarios
  are summarized in <a href="102.htm#tab76">Table 7-6</a>.</p>
<p>The outcome of these deliberations is that a basis now exists for the development
  and ongoing monitoring of future research strategies as air transport and concern
  about its environmental impact continues to grow.</p>
<h4><a name="756"></a>7.5.6. Summary of Key Points Relating to Combustion Technology</h4>
<p>Several important conclusions can be drawn from the present assessment of combustion
  technology in relation to emissions production and control: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Research and development programs over the past 25 years have provided
    a basis for vastly improved combustion systems for modern aircraft engines.
    Current combustion systems achieve virtually 100% energy conversion efficiency
    at virtually all power settings. Better fuel/air mixing processes, liner cooling
    techniques, and materials have contributed to this progress. The levels of
    unburned products, such as CO and HC, from engines are now very low, and visible
    smoke levels are now under control.</li>
  <li> Reductions in CO<span class="subscript">2</span> depend primarily on engine cycle, not the combustor.
    The role of the combustor is to ensure that the demands of the more fuel-efficient
    cycle (low CO<span class="subscript">2</span>) are met without compromising engine performance.</li>
  <li> The more fuel-efficient engines, with their high bypass ratios, introduced
    in the 1970s and 1980s reduced CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, HC, and CO emissions but increased NO<span class="subscript">x</span>.
    Although technological improvements have constrained the rise in NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, it has
    become clear that more substantial reductions require more radical solutions
    (with associated risks and penalties).</li>
  <li> Technology that has reduced NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions at high power, near the ground,
    also reduces NO<span class="subscript">x</span> at high altitude, though not necessarily by the same amount.
  </li>
  <li>Current research goals are to achieve NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels of 50% of current standards
    in 5 to 10 years. Work is also in progress to achieve NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels 50-70% below
    current NO<span class="subscript">x</span> standards using more advanced, staged combustors. </li>
  <li>Although there has been a marked improvement in the measurement and assessment
    of trace species and aerosols emerging from engines, knowledge about their
    formation-hence our ability to control them-is extremely limited.</li>
