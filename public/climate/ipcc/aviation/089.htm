<h1>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>
<p>In a report addressing the effects of aviation on the global atmosphere, the
  link between emissions and the technological status of aircraft now and in the
  future is clearly a central issue. The subject is complex. Our approach here,
  therefore, has been to identify a number of key questions, the answers to which
  provide an assessment of technical issues, problems, and the prospects of solving
  them.</p>
<p>The questions and their corresponding answers are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Question-What are the principal technological factors that determine the
    nature and scale of emissions from aircraft at altitude?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p> Answer-The overriding technological consideration in the design of aircraft
    today is safety. Given that prerequisite, aircraft are designed to provide
    an efficient and environmentally acceptable system of transport from ground
    level to the demanding conditions associated with high-speed flight at high
    altitudes. To achieve high efficiency, fuel consumption must be minimized
    by reducing the weight and drag of the aircraft. This requirement also ensures
    that there is a constant drive toward the highest levels of energy conversion
    efficiency from the engine. Together, these factors ensure that carbon dioxide
    CO<span class="subscript">2</span>) and water outputs are minimized.</p>
  <p>The most fuel-efficient engines for today's aircraft are high bypass, high
    pressure ratio gas turbine engines. No known alternatives are in sight. These
    engines have high combustion pressures and temperatures; although these features
    are consistent with fuel efficiency, they increase NO<span class="subscript">x</span> formation rates-especially
    at high power take-off and at altitude cruise conditions. </p>
  <p>Current low-sulfur fuels minimize SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O emissions. Small amounts of fuel-bound
    sulfur (400-600 ppm) and associated organic acids provide important lubricity
    properties for critical fuel system components. Processing to remove all traces
    of sulfur would remove important organic acids, so sulfur-free fuels are unlikely
    to be adopted in the short term. Sulfur removal would also result in a small
    net rise in CO<span class="subscript">2</span>. </p>
  <p>At present there is only limited knowledge about the formation and behavior
    of minor, trace species and aerosols found in the exhaust plumes of engines.
    Even less is known about how they are influenced by engine features and characteristics.
    . Question-What progress has been made to date in reducing emissions, and
    how may new advances in aircraft and engine technology help reduce them further
    in the future? </p>
  <p>Answer-In the past 40 years, aircraft fuel efficiency has improved by 70%
    through improvements in airframe design, engine technology, and rising load
    factors. More than half of this improvement has come from advances in engine
    technology. These trends are expected to continue, with airframe improvements
    expected to play a larger role through improvements in aerodynamic efficiency,
    new materials, and advances in control and handling systems. New, larger aircraft
    with, for example, a blended-wing body or double-deck cabin offer prospects
    of further benefits by relaxing some of the design constraints attached to
    today's large conventional aircraft. Because of the very long total lifetimes
    of today's aircraft (up to 50 years), however, replacement rates are low,
    and the fuel efficiency of the whole fleet will improve slowly. Rising market
    demand will ensure that this trend is maintained, however. </p>
  <p>The intrinsic link between lower CO and rising levels of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is being successfully
    countered with relatively simple strategies in state-of-the-art combustors.
    These combustors have achieved 20-40% reductions in NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. Consolidation of
    these improvements to broaden their applicability to newer, even more fuel-efficient
    engines demands further improvements in combustor technology. Major research
    programs are underway to do so. </p>
  <p>Although the use of hydrogen as a fuel offers a way to eliminate CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and
    further reduce NO<span class="subscript">x</span> from aircraft, widespread use of hydrogen fuel presents
    major design problems for aircraft and would entail global changes in supply,
    ground handling, and storage. Hydrogen would also substantially increase water
    vapor emissions from aircraft. Thus, kerosene-type fuels are considered to
    be the only viable option for aircraft within the next 50 years (to 2050).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li> Question-What data exist about actual emissions from aircraft? What is
    being done and what needs to be done to improve our understanding of and our
    ability to predict the scale and nature of these emissions?
    <p>Answer-The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) engine emissions
      databank is a substantial and growing source of reliable information that
      is now being used to develop aircraft emissions inventories and to analyze
      specific emissions. The databank-which includes information on smoke, hydrocarbons
      (HC), carbon moNO<span class="subscript">x</span>ide (CO), and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emitted during a defined landing and
      take-off cycle-is collated with prescribed correction procedures to guarantee
      consistency and comparability. There is no comparable source of data relating
      to sulfur compounds (SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O) and minor trace species or aerosols from engines.
      Such data are emerging from individual research programs, but much more
      must be done to increase the breadth and depth of knowledge about the formation,
      nature, and scale of these potentially important aircraft emissions. </p>
    <p>Important progress has been made in the measurement and observation of
      the transient behavior of minor and trace species in engines. Again, further
      work is needed before conclusions can be drawn that might offer clues concerning
      their control and reduction in future engines. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Question-How are emissions from aircraft currently regulated, and how do
    these regulations influence emissions at altitude?
    <p>Answer-Present aircraft emissions regulations apply only to the landing
      and take-off cycle up to an altitude of 900 m. However, these regulations
      exert a controlling influence on emissions from aircraft at cruise altitudes
      because design changes to achieve lower NO<span class="subscript">x</span> at take-off are equally beneficial
      at medium-power cruise conditions. Methods have been developed to use the
      ICAO databank to predict aircraft emissions at altitude cruise conditions.
      These predictions are accurate to within 5-10% for a modern, high bypass
      ratio engine. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Question-What performance might we expect from new aircraft entering the
    fleets in 2015 and 2050 (the dates of the scenarios discussed in <a href="130.htm">Chapter
    9</a>)?
    <p>Answer-The emerging effects of research and technology programs on airframes
      and engines will influence future fleets of subsonic aircraft. A group of
      aerospace industry experts has developed some technology projections relating
      to fuel efficiency and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions of aircraft by the years 2015 and 2050.
      According to these scenarios, average fuel efficiency of new production
      aircraft in the scheduled commercial fleet may improve by 20% between 1997
      and 2015. The corresponding scenarios for improvement between 1997 and 2050
      involved two different technology scenarios to take account of tradeoffs
      between fuel efficiency and low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in aircraft designs. In the first case,
      with fuel efficiency taking priority, a 40-50% improvement in the fuel efficiency
      of new production aircraft was projected. In the second case, where NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
      reductions took priority, a 30-40% improvement in fuel efficiency was envisaged.
    </p>
    <p>New commercial supersonic transport aircraft, operating at speeds of Mach
      2 to 2.4, have been proposed for introduction into service, though not before
      2015. It now seems unlikely that any commercial supersonic transports will
      exceed flight speeds of Mach 2.5 within the next 50 years as a result of
      engineering problems, materials limits, fuel efficiency, and other economic
      considerations. Supersonic aircraft are intrinsically less fuel efficient
      than subsonic aircraft. They consume about twice as much fuel, on a passenger-kilometer
      basis, as subsonic aircraft of the same size and range. To minimize stratospheric
      ozone depletion, the major design criteria for supersonic aircraft focus
      on flight altitude and low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> output. Water vapor emissions may become
      more important than NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions. If so, control of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions will
      depend solely on the achievement of greater fuel efficiency. Sulfur aerosols
      originating in the fuel are an emerging concern in the altitude bands used
      by supersonic aircraft. As in the subsonic aircraft case, more data are
      needed to determine their true impact. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Question-What are the likely effects of small aircraft and military aircraft
    on the environment?
    <p>Answer-Small aircraft, including commuter aircraft and general aviation,
      pose little environmental threat because they consume a very small fraction
      of the total of aviation fuel. Similarly, military aircraft, which consume
      less than 20% of the total aviation fuel supply today and, as civil aviation
      grows, perhaps less than 5% in the next 50 years, are seen as having potentially
      small environmental impacts.</p>
