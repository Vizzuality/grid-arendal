<p>Supersonic aircraft emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O were incorporated within six 2-D
  models and three 3-D models. These supersonic aircraft emissions are primarily
  deposited within the Northern Hemisphere LS.<a href="049.htm#img46a"> Figure
  4-6</a> shows calculated perturbations in NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O from HSCT emissions in
  June 2015 with EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5 (scenario S1c-D). Maximum perturbations occur in the
  Northern Hemisphere LS and range from 0.6 to 1.0 ppbv for NOy and from 0.4 to
  0.7 ppmv for H<span class="subscript">2</span>O. Based on the calculated perturbation in NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, one can
  conclude that the transport fields of these multi-dimensional assessment models
  are significantly different. For example, the GSFC model shows a significantly
  larger calculated perturbation in Northern Hemisphere lower stratospheric NOy
  than the other models (20-40% higher peak NOy abundance). This model also transports
  more NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O higher into the middle stratosphere (MS) and into the Southern
  Hemisphere than the other models. By contrast, the AER model tends to isolate
  supersonic emission increases in NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O within the Northern Hemisphere
  LS. The THINAIR and LLNL models calculate a NOy perturbation from supersonic
  aircraft in the Northern Hemisphere LS that approaches that of the GSFC model.
  However, these models transport much less aircraft-enhanced NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O to the
  Southern Hemisphere. CSIRO model NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O perturbations are similar to those
  of LLNL, except that the maximum NOy abundance increase in the Northern Hemisphere
  LS is significantly less. The SLIMCAT model shows greater NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O enhancements
  in the Southern Hemisphere than the GSFC model but smaller Northern Hemisphere
  perturbations. Aircraft-induced NOy enhancements in the middle stratosphere
  are greatest in the THINAIR, GSFC, and SLIMCAT models for Northern Hemisphere
  and tropical regions. Overall, the AER, CSIRO, LLNL, and THINAIR models show
  the greatest Northern Hemisphere isolation of supersonic aircraft effluent among
  the participating assessment models. The UNIVAQ, LARC, and SCTM1 models derive
  a maximum Northern Hemisphere LS NOy abundance increase similar to CSIRO. However,
  these models derive relatively small horizontal gradients in the LS horizontal
  spread in NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, extending from Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes to Southern
  Hemisphere high latitudes, suggesting a weak tropical/mid-latitude barrier to
  mixing. The UNIVAQ, SLIMCAT, SCTM1, and LARC models generate Southern Hemisphere
  LS NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O magnitudes that are similar to those of the GSFC model. To first
  order, the spread in model-derived changes in total O<span class="subscript">3</span> for the ensemble of scenarios
  shown in Tables <a href="049.htm#tab411">4-11</a> and <a href="049.htm#tab412">4-12</a>
  is a direct result of large differences between supersonic aircraft-induced
  perturbations in the NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O fields. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4332"></a>4.3.3.2. Profile and Column Ozone Change </i></h4>
<p>The percentage change in profile O<span class="subscript">3</span> for June is shown in <a href="049.htm#img46c">Figure
  4-6c</a> for scenario S1c-D. Above 25 km, in all models, local O<span class="subscript">3</span> abundance
  is reduced as a result of including supersonic aircraft emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and
  H<span class="subscript">2</span>O. This result is not surprising because all assessment models represent the
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> (middle stratosphere) and HO<span class="subscript">x</span> (upper stratosphere) chemical families as
  prime contributors to odd-oxygen loss above 25 km, in approximately the same
  relative importance. Therefore, sensitivity to NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions from supersonic
  aircraft exhaust is similar in these regions and roughly proportional to calculated
  perturbations in NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O. Below 25 km, the relative odd-oxygen loss partitioning
  between NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, HO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and ClO<span class="subscript">x</span>-BrO<span class="subscript">x</span> chemical families is highly model-dependent.
  This situation is evident in the calculated local O<span class="subscript">3</span> change. Models that are
  more HO<span class="subscript">x</span> dominant in the LS tend to show a more positive response to added aircraft
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. The opposite is true for models that are more NO<span class="subscript">x</span> dominant. These variations
  are a result of different methodologies of transport and chemistry incorporated
  in the individual models. </p>
<p>The percentage change in total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> is shown in <a href="049.htm#img46d">Figure
  4-6d</a> for scenario S1c-D. Six of the models (AER, CSIRO, GSFC, LLNL, SCTM1,
  and UNIVAQ) indicate smaller depletions in the tropics and larger depletions
  at mid- and high latitudes. The other three models (LARC, SLIMCAT, and THINAIR)
  show more complicated features. The LARC model predicts increases in Northern
  Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes and decreases in the tropics. The SLIMCAT
  model predicts decreases of more than 0.6% in the tropics, with less depletion
  predicted at Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes and Southern Hemisphere
  mid-latitudes. The THINAIR model generally predicts larger depletions at lower
  latitudes. Decreases in Northern Hemisphere polar latitudes of greater than
  1% are shown in the AER model results. The GSFC and SLIMCAT models predict decreases
  in the Southern Hemisphere polar spring of greater than 1%. </p>

<p>Sensitivity studies of supersonic engine emissions of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> were carried
  out. These studies investigated individual and combined impacts on O<span class="subscript">3</span> from H<span class="subscript">2</span>O
  and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions within an atmosphere that was volcanically clean (SA0). In
  <a href="050.htm#img47">Figure 4-7a</a>, the change in annual average Northern
  Hemisphere total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> as a function of EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) is shown for a fleet of
  500 supersonic aircraft in the year 2015 (Scenarios S1b-e). The reference atmosphere
  included emissions from a representative 2015 fleet of subsonic aircraft. Under
  the conditions of these scenarios, the models predict that water emissions [corresponding
  to EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=0] have the most significant impact. For EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=0, the participating
  models all derive a total O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion in the 0.2-0.6% range. </p>
<p>For low emission indices of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> [EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5 to 10], the predicted decrease in
  O<span class="subscript">3</span> is dominated by emitted H<span class="subscript">2</span>O; in most models, the addition of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  leads to less predicted O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion. Because O<span class="subscript">3</span> loss in the lower stratosphere
  tends to be dominated by HO<span class="subscript">x</span> constituents and supersonic aircraft emissions
  are most important in the lower stratosphere (see <a href="049.htm#img46a">Figure
  4-6</a>), the predicted importance of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions is understandable. </p>
<p>Several models show relatively little sensitivity to NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions over the
  EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5 to 15 range. Including NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission at an EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5 level, S1c had
  little effect on total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> change for the LLNL, GSFC, and CSIRO models
  [relative to EI (NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=0]. For the AER, SLIMCAT, and UNIVAQ models, added NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  buffers the larger total O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion derived when H<span class="subscript">2</span>O is the only emitted constituent.
  When NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission is included, six of the models (CSIRO, GSFC, LLNL, SCTM1,
  SLIMCAT, and THINAIR) calculate a larger O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion as EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) increases from
  5 to 15 (S1c-e). The AER model showed little sensitivity to EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) in this
  range. Within the same range, the LARC and UNIVAQ models showed a positive O<span class="subscript">3</span>
  change slope. In general, the model-derived O<span class="subscript">3</span> change is in better agreement
  among participating models at EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5, with a spread among models from approximately
  0% total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion (UNIVAQ) down to -0.4% (GSFC and SLIMCAT). At EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=15,
  the overall spread in model-derived total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> change is much larger (+0.4%
  to -0.9%). </p>
<p>There is also a large spread in interhemispheric gradients in model-derived
  total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> change (see Tables <a href="049.htm#tab411">4-11</a> and <a href="049.htm#tab412">4-12</a>).
  For example, when the emission scenario is S1c [EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5 with 500 supersonic
  aircraft], the AER, SCTM1, and CSIRO models derived a larger depletion in total
  column O<span class="subscript">3</span> in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. The UNIVAQ
  model had very little change in column O<span class="subscript">3</span> in either hemisphere. The LLNL and
  THINAIR models derived a similar change in total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> in both hemispheres.
  However, the ratio of Southern Hemisphere to Northern Hemisphere change in total
  column O<span class="subscript">3</span> is greater than 1.5 in the GSFC, LARC, and SLIMCAT models. This larger
  depletion in the Southern Hemisphere correlates with increased H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and NOy being
  transported to the Southern Hemisphere and the sensitivity of cold aerosol processes
  implemented within the GSFC, LARC, and SLIMCAT models. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4334"></a>4.3.3.4. Ambient Surface Area Density Sensitivity </i></h4>
<p>Volcanic activity within the past several decades has greatly modulated ambient
  SAD. Two major volcanic eruptions-El Chichón (April 1982) and Mt. Pinatubo (June
  1991)-are responsible for most of the observed SAD change. Satellite instruments
  (SAM, SAGE I, SAGE II, and SME; e.g., Thomason et al., 1997) have shown that
  average SAD in the lower stratosphere between 1979 and 1995 was greater than
  that during volcanically clean periods (SA0; WMO, 1992) by a factor of 8 in
  the equatorial region and a factor of 2 to 4 at higher latitudes. These enhancements
  decay with e-folding time scales on the order of 1 to 2 years (Yue et al., 1991;
  Thomason et al., 1997). </p>
<p>For this assessment, we examined the impact of supersonic aircraft at a SAD
  of four times the volcanically clean condition (4xSA0). Results from these higher
  SAD sensitivity studies are shown in <a href="050.htm#img47">Figure 4-7b</a>. Unlike
  the volcanically clean ambient atmosphere (<a href="050.htm#img47">Figure 4-7a</a>),
  when the EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) varies between 0 and 15 (S3a-d), all participating models derived
  a positive slope to the Northern Hemispherical change in total column O<span class="subscript">3</span>. All
  models show a strong interference of the H<span class="subscript">2</span>O only [EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=0] total O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion
  when NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions are included [EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5]. This response is consistent with
  the idea that at higher ambient SAD, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> catalytic processes are less important,
  mainly as a result of conversion of active NO<span class="subscript">x</span> radicals to nitric acid by heterogeneous
  reactions on sulfate aerosols. As supersonic aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is enhanced, the additional
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> interferes with ClO<span class="subscript">x</span>, BrO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and HO<span class="subscript">x</span> odd-oxygen loss processes, reducing
  the net total odd-oxygen loss. </p>
<p>It should be noted that the model-derived impact on total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> from increasing
  ambient SAD by natural causes (approximately 2-3% decreases in Northern Hemisphere
  mid-latitude total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> change; Solomon et al., 1996) exceeds the model-derived
  impact from supersonic aircraft (typically less than 1% Northern Hemisphere
  mid-latitude total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> change). </p>
<h4><i><a name="4335"></a>4.3.3.5. Sulfate Aerosols and Polar Stratospheric Cloud
  Sensitivities </i></h4>
<p>Heterogeneous reactions are important in defining the O<span class="subscript">3</span> removal rate in the
  stratosphere. These reactions occur on sulfate aerosols and PSC particles, though
  sulfate aerosols have the greater influence because of their global distribution.
  New sulfate aerosols are produced by aircraft emissions; sulfate particles are
  generated by plume processing of part of the emitted SO<span class="subscript">2</span>/SO<span class="subscript">3</span> (Fahey et al.,
  1995; Brown et al., 1996; Danilin et al., 1997; Kärcher, 1997; Kärcher and Fahey,
  1997). The remaining gas-phase SO<span class="subscript">2</span> is then transported on the atmospheric large/global
  scale, where it is oxidized to sulfuric acid and condenses onto preexisting
  sulfate aerosol particles (Bekki and Pyle, 1992; Pitari et al., 1993; Weisenstein
  et al., 1998). Aircraft also emit H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and therefore have the potential
  to increase the saturation ratios of water vapor and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>, so that the size
  distribution, mass, and SAD of PSCs may be perturbed (Peter et al., 1991; Pitari
  et al., 1993; see <a href="037.htm#336">Section 3.3.6</a>). </p>

<h4><i><a name="43351"></a>4.3.3.5.1. Sulfate aerosol sensitivity-SO<span class="subscript">2</span> gas-to-particle
  conversion in the supersonic aircraft plume </i></h4>
<p>Supersonic aircraft consuming sulfur-containing fuel will have some effect
  on sulfate aerosol amounts in the stratosphere (see <a href="041.htm#373">Section
  3.7.3</a>). In this assessment, the increased SAD from sulfur conversion to
  particles in the plume had a significant impact on stratospheric ozone. <a href="050.htm#img48">Figure
  4-8</a> shows the percentage change in annual average Northern Hemisphere total
  column O<span class="subscript">3</span> correlated to the percentage increase in SAD for given SO<span class="subscript">2</span> gas-to-particle
  conversion assumptions. The percentage SAD increase is derived by averaging
  the SAD change relative to the volcanically clean atmosphere (SA0) within the
  region between 14-21 km and 33-90°N. The SAD percentage increases for 0, 10,
  50, and 100% SO<span class="subscript">2</span> gas-to-particle conversion assumptions in the plume are 27,
  38, 82, and 111%, respectively. The 0% SAD increase on the abscissa is taken
  from supersonic scenario S1c; it represents a perturbation without any consideration
  of aircraft sulfur emissions. The AER model was the only model to compute the
  0% SO<span class="subscript">2</span> gas-to-particle conversion impact on total O<span class="subscript">3</span> change. Here, the additional
  aircraft-emitted SO<span class="subscript">2</span> gas increased the ambient SAD by 27%, altering the total
  O<span class="subscript">3</span> decrease for the AER model from 0.3 (SA0) to 0.6% (SA7). When particle conversion
  was assumed, all participating models derived relatively large decreases in
  total O<span class="subscript">3</span>. In fact, AER and GSFC model results for the Northern Hemisphere showed
  O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletions of greater than 1% when a 50% SO<span class="subscript">2</span> gas-to-particle conversion efficiency
  was assumed. </p>
<h4><i><a name="43352"></a>4.3.3.5.2. PSC sensitivity </i></h4>
<p>The change in SAD of PSCs from HSCT aircraft emissions has been calculated
  by the AER, GSFC and UNIVAQ 2-D models. The surface area increase is a consequence
  of the stratospheric injection of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and NOy from aircraft. This process has
  the effect of increasing the saturation ratios of both water vapor and nitric
  acid, producing an enhancement of PSC particle mass and SAD. Changes in H<span class="subscript">2</span>O
  and NOy from HSCT aircraft at 18 km and 60°N and 60°S are listed in Tables <a href="050.htm#tab413a">4-13a</a>
  and <a href="050.htm#tab413b">4-13b</a>. The average additional SAD of PSC1+PSC2
  aerosols in the 12-24 km altitude layer and poleward of 60°N during December-January-February
  (DJF) or poleward of 60°S during June-July-August (JJA) are shown in Tables<a href="050.htm#tab413c">
  4-13c</a> and <a href="050.htm#tab413d">4-13d</a>. These results should be interpreted
  with caution because PSC distributions are highly localized. </p>

<p>All three models assume PSC1 to be solid NAT particles, although the treatment
  for PSC1 and PSC2 formation varies from model to model. AER and GSFC use a thermodynamic
  equilibrium between gas and condensed phase for HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O (Hanson and Mauersberger,
  1988), with an imposed size distribution. Supersaturation ratios of 10 and 1.4
  are required before PSC1 and PSC2 form in the GSFC model, thus lowering the
  temperature threshold for particle nucleation by about 3 and 2 K, respectively.
  Denitrification and dehydration are included in the models by calculating HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>
  and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O loss terms from sedimentation. The UNIVAQ model makes the calculation
  by integrating on the NAT/ice particle size distribution; the AER and GSFC models
  assume that all condensed HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O form NAT and ice particles of a prescribed
  size distribution. No supersaturation is assumed in the AER model. In these
  two models, perturbations of sulfate aerosols from aircraft emission of SO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  leave unaffected the PSC. The models do allow H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> changes from aircraft
  to affect PSC. The UNIVAQ model allows interaction between sulfate aerosols
  and PSC by adopting a microphysical code for both types of particles (Pitari
  et al., 1993). As the atmosphere cools, PSC1 particles are first formed by nucleating
  on preexisting sulfate aerosols; below the frost point, PSC1 become coated with
  ice, thus forming PSC2 particles. With this scheme, a simultaneous presence
  of sulfate, PSC1, and PSC2 particles is possible, and size distributions are
  calculated for all particle types. </p>
<p>The spread in absolute change of PSC SADs shown in Tables <a href="050.htm#tab413c">4-13c</a>
  and <a href="050.htm#tab413d">4-13d</a> is not surprising because of the different
  schemes for PSC formation adopted in the models. In particular, the absence
  of supersaturation assumptions in the AER model consistently produces larger
  PSC SAD. The spread in relative changes is closely related to different relative
  increases of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and NOy. About 50-60% (70-90%) of the calculated PSC perturbation
  in the Northern Hemisphere (Southern Hemisphere) is caused by HSCT H<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions
  when EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5. The more important role of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions in the Antarctic winter
  is a consequence of persistent PSC2 particles there; in the Arctic winter, PSC1
  particles contribute to almost the entire available PSC SAD. </p>
<h4><i><a name="43353"></a>4.3.3.5.3. Column ozone sensitivity to PSCs </i></h4>
<p>Representation of heterogeneous processes on cold aerosols (PSCs) is not consistent
  among the participating models (<a href="049.htm#4313">Sections 4.3.1.3</a>
  and <a href="050.htm#4335">4.3.3.5.</a>). These differences are manifest when increased abundances of NO<span class="subscript">Y</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O from supersonic aircraft are considered. As mentioned previously,
  the transport fields of participating assessment models are significantly different;
  therefore, the amount of supersonic H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and NOy dispersion between hemispheres
  and vertically within the same hemisphere is also different. Three models (AER,
  GSFC, and UNIVAQ) investigated the impact on total O<span class="subscript">3</span> when cold aerosol representation
  was not included (S4b). These models removed their representation of SAD, dehydration,
  and denitrification that would be associated with cold aerosol processes. The
  results were mixed. When cold aerosol processes were included in the model chemistry
  formulation, the model-derived percentage change in Northern Hemisphere total
  column O<span class="subscript">3</span> increased by factors of 1.1 and 1.5 for the GSFC and AER models, respectively
  (S1c vs. S4b). However, in the Southern Hemisphere the GSFC model-derived depletion
  in total O<span class="subscript">3</span> increased by 2.5 when cold chemistry processes were included. There
  was minimal change in Southern Hemisphere average O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion in the AER model.
  When the EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) is set to zero (S4a), a similar conclusion is also drawn (compare
  to S1b) by the AER and GSFC models. These results are consistent with the dispersion
  of supersonic H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and NOy between the AER and GSFC models. The UNIVAQ model
  did show sensitivity to supersonic emissions in the total O<span class="subscript">3</span> hemispheric averages;
  because the absolute impact was small and centered around zero, however, it
  is difficult to draw any significant conclusions. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4336"></a>4.3.3.6. Ambient Chlorine Sensitivity </i></h4>
<p>Total radical chlorine (Cl<span class="subscript">y</span>) abundance in the atmosphere is predicted to decrease
  in the future as a result of international agreements controlling production
  of anthropogenic organic source gases such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and
  hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) (WMO 1995, 1999). Therefore, several sensitivity
  studies were performed to investigate the impact of ambient Cl<span class="subscript">y</span> levels on a
  given supersonic aircraft perturbation. Here, atmospheric chlorine amounts were
  varied by changing halocarbon boundary conditions. Four different ground halocarbon
  amounts were considered, which resulted in reactive Cl<span class="subscript">y</span> levels of 1.0, 2.0,
  3.0, and 4.0 ppbv in the upper stratosphere. For reference, the 3.0 and 2.0
  ppbv Cl<span class="subscript">y</span> levels are representative of predicted 2015 and 2050 atmospheric conditions,
  respectively. In all Cl<span class="subscript">y</span> sensitivity studies, only EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5 and a fleet of
  500 supersonic aircraft were considered. Sensitivity studies were conducted
  under volcanically clean conditions without aircraft sulfur emissions (SA0)
  and with sulfur emissions assuming 50% SO<span class="subscript">2</span> gas-to-particle conversion in the
  plume (SA1). Without aircraft sulfur emissions, there was little discernible
  sensitivity to background Cl<span class="subscript">y</span> abundance (S1c, S5a, S6a, and S9a). With sulfur
  emissions included, however, total ozone depletion for all three participating
  models was smallest when Cl<span class="subscript">y</span> abundance was 1.0 ppbv. As Cl<span class="subscript">y</span> increased in abundance,
  the model-derived ozone depletion increased, maximizing and leveling off between
  3.0 and 4.0 ppbv Cl<span class="subscript">y</span> (S1f, S5b, S6b, and S9c). Among the participating models,
  AER showed the most sensitivity to Cl<span class="subscript">y</span> abundance, followed by GSFC and UNIVAQ.
  It should be noted that the Cl<span class="subscript">y</span>=2 ppbv scenario (S9c) had N<span class="subscript">2</span>O and CH<span class="subscript">4</span> boundary
  conditions consistent with the year 2050. The other three Cl<span class="subscript">y</span> sensitivity scenarios
  (S1f, S5b, and S6b) had N<span class="subscript">2</span>O and CH<span class="subscript">4</span> abundances consistent with the year 2015.
  The AER model did investigate Cl<span class="subscript">y</span> sensitivity to N<span class="subscript">2</span>O and CH<span class="subscript">4</span> boundary conditions
  by repeating the Cl<span class="subscript">y</span>=2.0 ppbv scenario with N<span class="subscript">2</span>O and CH<span class="subscript">4</span> values representative
  of 2015 conditions. The model-derived change in NH total O<span class="subscript">3</span> was -0.6% (instead
  of -0.7% under 2050 CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and N<span class="subscript">2</span>O conditions). </p>
<h4><i><a name="4337"></a>4.3.3.7. Fleet Design </i></h4>
<h4><i><a name="43371"></a>4.3.3.7.1. Supersonic cruise altitude sensitivity </i></h4>
<p><a href="050.htm#img49">Figure 4-9</a> (S1c, S2a, and S2b) shows the effect of
  lowering or raising the supersonic cruise altitude by 2 km relative to the baseline
  flight cruise altitude band of 17-20 km for an assumed fleet of 500 EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)=5
  aircraft. In most altitude sensitivity studies, ambient SAD was considered to
  be volcanically clean, and sulfur emission by HSCT aircraft was not included.
  The model-derived change in annual average Northern Hemisphere total column
  O<span class="subscript">3</span> had a large dependence on emission altitude in participating assessment models.
  This cruise altitude impact on O<span class="subscript">3</span> highlights the fact that as NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is emitted
  lower in the stratosphere, the residence time of supersonic aircraft emitted
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is significantly shorter. In addition, at a lower cruise altitude the chemical
  regime is quite different, and past modeling studies have shown that a crossover
  point exists where an additional NO<span class="subscript">x</span> molecule will produce O<span class="subscript">3</span> based on the well-known
  CH<span class="subscript">4</span>-smog mechanism (Johnston and Quitevis, 1975). When the cruise altitude is
  shifted higher, emissions have a longer stratospheric lifetime and can be transported
  more readily to regions dominated by NO<span class="subscript">x</span> destruction of O<span class="subscript">3</span>. </p>
<p>Each of these models showed less total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion when the cruise
  altitude was shifted down by 2 km. Three models also investigated sensitivity
  to higher values of EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) (10 and 15) at the lower cruise altitude (S2c-d).
  The model-derived total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> change generally increased in the direction
  of higher EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>). These results are consistent with the 1995 NASA supersonic
  assessment (Stolarski et al., 1995). </p>
<p>Two models (AER and UNIVAQ) did look at sensitivity to cruise altitude with
  increased SAD from sulfur emissions as 50% particles (S7c). In this scenario,
  an enhanced SAD was not supplied but derived within the 2-D model, coupled with
  a sulfate microphysical model. The model-derived annual average Northern Hemisphere
  depletion in total column O<span class="subscript">3</span> was reduced from -1.0 (S7a) to -0.6% (S7c) in the
  AER model and from -0.5 (S7a) to -0.2% (S7c) in the UNIVAQ model when the supersonic
  cruise altitude was lowered by 2 km. The opposite impact was derived by the
  AER model when the cruise altitude was raised 2 km. Here, the model-derived
  annual average Northern Hemisphere depletion in total O<span class="subscript">3</span> increased from -1.0
  (S7a) to -1.4 % (S7b) in the AER model and from -0.5 to -0.7% in the UNIVAQ
  model. </p>
<h4><i><a name="43372"></a>4.3.3.7.2. Supersonic fleet size sensitivity </i></h4>
<p>In this assessment, fleet sizes of 500 and 1,000 supersonic aircraft were considered
  at EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) values of 5 and 10. The increase in fleet size from 500 to 1,000
  aircraft included additional routes as well as additional aircraft; as a consequence,
  the geographical distribution of emissions changes with proportionally more
  flights in the tropics (Baughcum and Henderson, 1998). In addition, by increasing
  the fleet size, the amount of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O emitted is also increased proportionally.
  For most of the cases considered, doubling the fleet size had a nearly linear
  effect on the Northern Hemisphere column O<span class="subscript">3</span> reduction. The exception is the
  UNIVAQ model, which showed almost no change with increasing fleet size. For
