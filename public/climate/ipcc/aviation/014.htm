<H2><b>1.1. Background </b></H2>
<p>Aviation is an integral part of the infrastructure of today's society. It plays
  an important role in the global economy; it supports both commerce (through
  business travel and air freight) and private travel. Aviation also plays an
  important role in military activity. As such, aviation affects the lives of
  citizens in every country in the world, regardless of whether they fly. The
  activities of the civil air transport industry have long been circumscribed
  by matters of public interest in addition to economic factors. Of most importance
  historically are matters related to safety and environmental issues associated
  with local noise and air pollution. Two global environmental issues have emerged
  for which aviation may have potentially important consequences: Climate change,
  including changes to weather patterns (i.e., rainfall, temperature, etc.), and,
  for supersonic aircraft, stratospheric ozone depletion and the resultant increase
  in UV-B radiation at the Earth's surface. Boxes <a href="014.htm#box11">1-1</a>
  and <a href="014.htm#box12">1-2</a> contain general descriptions of the basic
  science and the political process related to these two issues (without addressing
  aviation in particular), respectively.</p>

  <tr>
    <td> <span class="boxTitle">Box 1-1. Climate Change and the Framework Convention</span>
      <p>Human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The atmospheric
	concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons,
	and tropospheric ozone have all increased over the past century. These
	rising levels of greenhouse gases are expected to cause climate change.
	By absorbing infrared radiation, these gases change the natural flow of
	energy through the climate system. The climate must somehow adjust to
	this "thickening blanket" of greenhouse gases to maintain the balance
	between energy arriving from the sun and energy escaping back into space.
	This relatively simple picture is complicated by increased amounts of
	sulfate aerosol from human activities that modulate incoming solar radiation
	and tend to cause a cooling effect on climate, at least on regional and
	hemispheric scales. </p>
      <p>Global mean surface air temperatures have increased by 0.3-0.6�C since
	the late 19th century, and recent years have been among the warmest on
	record. Any human-induced effect on climate, however, is superimposed
	on natural climate variability resulting from climate fluctuations (e.g.,
	El Ni�o) and external causes such as solar variability and volcanic eruptions.
	More sophisticated approaches are now being applied to the detection and
	attribution of the causes of change in climate by looking, for example,
	for spatial patterns expected from climate-forcing change by greenhouse
	gases and aerosols. To date, the balance of the evidence suggests that
	there is a discernible human influence on the global climate.</p>
      <p> Model projections of future climate, based on the present understanding
	of climate processes and using emission scenarios (IS92) based on a range
	of economic and technological assumptions, estimate a rise in global mean
	temperature of 1-3.5�C (best estimate 2�C) between 1990 and 2100. In all
	cases, the average rate of warming would probably be greater than any
	in the past 10,000 years, though actual annual-to-decadal changes would
	include considerable natural variability. A general warming is expected
	to lead to an increase in the occurrence of extremely hot days and a decrease
	in the occurrence of extremely cold days. Regional temperature changes
	could differ substantially from the global mean value, and there are many
	uncertainties about the scale and impacts of climate change, particularly
	at the regional level. The mean sea level is expected to rise 15-95 cm
	(best estimate 50 cm) by 2100, with some flooding of low-lying areas.
	Forests, deserts, rangelands, and other unmanaged ecosystems would face
	new climatic stresses, partly as a result of changes in the hydrological
	cycle; many could decline or fragment, with some individual species of
	flora or fauna becoming extinct. Because of the delaying effect of the
	oceans, surface temperatures do not respond immediately to greenhouse
	gas emissions, so climate change would continue for many decades even
	if atmospheric concentrations were stabilized. </p>
      <p>Achieving stabilized atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases would
	demand a major effort. For CO<span class="subscript">2</span> alone, freezing global emissions at their
	current rates would result in a doubling of its atmospheric concentrations
	from pre-industrial levels soon after 2100. Eventually, emissions would
	have to decrease well below current levels for concentrations to stabilize
	at doubled CO<span class="subscript">2</span> levels, and they would have to continue to fall thereafter
	to maintain a constant CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration. The radiative forcing of greenhouse
	gas levels (including methane, nitrous oxide, and others, but not aerosols)
	could equal that caused by a doubling of pre-industrial CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentrations
	by 2030 and a trebling or more by 2100. </p>
      <p>The international community is tackling this challenge through the United
	Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Adopted in 1992,
	the Convention seeks to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
	gases at safe levels. More than 170 countries have become Parties to the
	Convention. Developed countries have agreed to take voluntary measures
	aimed at returning their emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, with
	further legally binding emissions cuts after the year 2000 proposed at
	Kyoto in late 1997. Developed countries have also agreed to promote financial
	and technological transfers to developing countries to help them address
	climate change.</p>

  <tr>
    <td> <span class="boxTitle">Box 1-2. Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, UV-B Radiation,
      and the Montreal Protocol </span>
      <p align="left">Although ozone can be measured throughout much of the atmosphere,
	most of it is found in the stratosphere in a layer centered about 20 km
	above the Earth's surface. Stratospheric ozone is beneficial to life on
	Earth because it blocks much of the dangerous ultraviolet light (UV-B)
	radiated by the sun. If unnaturally high levels of UV-B radiation reach
	the Earth's surface, many forms of life can be harmed. For instance, UV-B
	can cause skin cancers in humans and may reduce crop yields. </p>
      <p align="left">Natural ozone amounts in the stratosphere result from a
	balance of production and loss processes involving chemistry, meteorology,
	and solar radiation. Since the 1960s, however, increases in atmospheric
	concentrations of human-generated chlorine- and bromine-containing compounds
	(principally chlorofluorocarbons and halons) have caused additional ozone
	loss. This trend has resulted in declines in stratospheric ozone amounts
	at middle and high latitudes in both hemispheres. The most dramatic manifestation
	is the Antarctic ozone hole, where more than half of the ozone is destroyed
	in a 6-week period each spring. In recent winters, similar features-but
	with half the ozone loss (20-30%)-have been observed over the Arctic,
	and at northern mid-latitudes a long-term decline of 5-10% has occurred
	over the past 20-30 years. Annual amounts of biologically active UV-B
	radiation have increased by about 10% over mid-latitudes since 1979. No
	significant loss of ozone or increase in UV-B radiation has been found
	in the tropics.</p>
      <p align="left"> Concern that chlorofluorocarbons might destroy ozone was
	first raised in the 1970s. Following the general realization that these
	human-generated chemicals posed a real threat to the ozone layer, the
	Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer was adopted in
	1985. Shortly afterwards, the Antarctic ozone hole was discovered, leading
	to renewed pressure to control ozone-depleting substances. In 1987, the
	Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was agreed;
	it has since been ratified by more than 160 countries. Initially, the
	Montreal Protocol imposed clear limits on the future production of chlorofluorocarbons
	and halons only; as scientific evidence about ozone depletion has mounted,
	however, the Protocol has been modified to include other chemicals. </p>
      <p align="left">As a direct result of these controls, there have been marked
	reductions in emissions of these substances into the atmosphere; assuming
	full compliance with the Protocol, these reductions will result in reduced
	atmospheric amounts of chlorine and bromine. However, the magnitude of
	the ozone loss at any given time depends on a number of factors. Although
	the amount of chlorine and bromine clearly is important, other influences
	include the temperature of the ozone layer, the atmosphere's chemical
	composition, and long-term changes in atmospheric circulation related
	to climate change. How all of these factors evolve over coming decades
	will determine future ozone amounts as chlorine and bromine are reduced.

<p>For both of these issues, the effects from aviation are part of a larger picture.
  Human-generated emissions at the Earth's surface can be carried aloft and affect
  the global atmosphere. The unique property of aircraft is that they fly several
  kilometers above the Earth's surface. The effects of most aircraft emissions
  depend strongly on the flight altitude and whether aircraft fly in the troposphere
  or stratosphere. The effects on the atmosphere can be markedly different from
  the effects of the same emissions at ground level.</p>
<p> A number of aircraft emissions can affect climate. Carbon dioxide CO<span class="subscript">2</span>) and
  water (H<span class="subscript">2</span>O) do so directly; other effects (e.g., production of ozone in the
  troposphere, alteration of methane lifetime, formation of contrails and modified
  cirrus cloudiness) are indirect. The emissions that can affect stratospheric
  ozone (i.e., nitrogen oxides, particulates, and water vapor) do so indirectly
  by modifying the chemical balance in the stratosphere. There has been sustained
  long-term growth in civil air transportation. For example, over the past 10
  years, passenger traffic on scheduled airlines has increased by 60%. Over the
  next 10 to 15 years, demand for air travel is expected to grow by about 5% per
  year (Airbus, 1997; Boeing, 1997; Brasseur et al., 1998), though there are likely
  to be regional variations in demand. In contrast, no such increase in the numbers
  of military aircraft is anticipated; they are expected to remain static or even
  decrease. As a consequence, fuel use and emissions produced by future military
  activities are expected to be a decreasing part of the total from aviation (see
  <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<p> Aviation fuel currently corresponds to 2-3% of the total fossil fuels used
  worldwide. Of this total, the majority (> 80%) is used by civil aviation. By
  comparison, the whole transportation sector currently accounts for 20-25% of
  all fossil fuel consumption. Thus, the aviation sector consumes 13% of the fossil
  fuel used in transportation; it is the second biggest sector after road transportation,
  which consumes 80% (IPCC, 1996b). </p>
<p>Given the continued growth of aviation, a number of questions have been raised
  regarding the future effects of aviation emissions on the global environment.
  For example, if supersonic aircraft (which fly primarily in the stratosphere)
  were to be introduced in significant numbers, what special effects might there
  be, and what trade-offs might be possible?</p>

<p> Answering such questions involves consideration of a number of complex issues
  and assumptions about the future growth, technology trends, and operational
  practices of the aircraft industry. In the past, for example, fuel efficiency
  has improved dramatically over time, so total aviation fuel use did not increase
  as fast as passenger or freight traffic. Fuel use, CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions, and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  per passenger-kilometer have decreased, but the increase in total NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  has been larger than the increase in total fuel use. If it is not technologically
  possible to reduce all aircraft emissions simultaneously, then some kind of
  trade-off may be needed. The relative environmental benefits of further reductions
  in all emissions need to be carefully considered; this analysis is one of the
  underlying aims of this report. </p>
<p>This report covers issues relating both to the atmosphere and to the aviation
  industry that address these questions. It is the first such assessment of a
  single industry and its global environmental impact. (Issues such as local air
  quality and ground transportation around airports are outside its scope, however,
  and are not discussed.)</p>
<p>The chapter structure and the major relationships between the chapters are
  depicted schematically in <a href="014.htm#img01">Figure 1-1</a>. This chapter
  provides a background for the main part of the report and indicates where detailed
  information on each subject can be found. In <a href="015.htm">Section 1.2</a>,
  the present-day aviation industry is described. In <a href="016.htm">Section
  1.3</a>, aircraft emissions that are most relevant for climate change and stratospheric
  ozone depletion are summarized. In <a href="017.htm">Section 1.4</a>, the use
  and development of future scenarios are discussed, and in <a href="018.htm">Section
  1.5</a>, possible options for mitigating the atmospheric effects of aviation
  are outlined.</p>
