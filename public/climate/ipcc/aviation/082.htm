<p>With uncertainty in relating RF to climate response noted above, it would be
  useful to compare CGCM-modeled climate responses for aircraft perturbations.
  Less agreement is expected between models because the magnitude of their feedback
  responses (i.e., climate sensitivity) can be quite different from one another.
  A review of different model sensitivities has been given in IPCC (1990, 1992,
  1996); the values vary from a sensitivity of about 0.4 K/(Wm<font size="-1">-2</font>)
  to 1.2 K/(Wm<font size="-1">-2</font>) for doubled CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>.
  How the sensitivity would vary for heterogeneous aircraft perturbations is not
  known. </p>
<p>The most appropriate tool would be simulations in the transient mode using
  coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs. These simulations are computationally very expensive,
  and it would be very difficult to separate signal from noise. To date, however,
  all known comprehensive model simulations of aircraft induced climate change
  were made in the quasi-stationary mode using either pure atmospheric GCMs (e.g.,
  Sausen et al., 1997) or atmospheric GCMs coupled to mixed layer ocean models
  (examples below). In other words, these simulations studied quasi-equilibrium
  response to a stationary or seasonally repeating perturbation. Pure atmospheric
  models underestimate the response if, for instance, sea surface temperature
  is fixed to a prescribed value. Equilibrium simulations with coupled models
  overestimate the aircraft effect in absolute numbers relative to transient simulations
  (see discussion in Sausen and Schumann, 1999), and the spatial pattern of climate
  change can serve only as a first estimate (Kattenberg et al., 1996). These simulations
  must be compared with analogous simulations for well-mixed greenhouse gases
  (e.g., CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font> doubling). Then the particular climate sensitivity
  to aircraft-induced radiative forcing and aircraft signatures of climate changes
  may possibly be extracted. </p>
<p>Using the GISS 3-D climate/middle atmosphere model, Rind and Lonergan (1995)
  studied the impact of the combined effect of a stratospheric ozone decrease
  and a tropospheric ozone increase from an assumed sub- and supersonic aircraft
  fleet for the year 2015. An equilibrium climate simulation leads to a general
  stratospheric cooling of a few tenths of a Kelvin, combined with a warming of
  the lower stratosphere in northern polar regions as a result of altered atmospheric
  circulation (<a href="082.htm#img611">Figure 6-11</a>). The globally averaged
  surface temperature change was found to be not statistically significant compared
  with climatic variability. </p>
<p>As another example, <a href="082.htm#img612">Figure 6-12</a> shows the equilibrium
  annual, zonal mean temperature change from ECHAM4/MLO (Ponater et al., 1998)
  due to ozone perturbations resulting from 1992 air traffic (Dameris et al.,
  1998), which differ slightly from the 1992 ozone perturbations reported in this
  assessment. The overall pattern of temperature change is statistically significant.
  The RF associated with this case is 0.04 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>, and the
  resulting equilibrium change of global mean surface temperature is 0.06 K, resulting
  in a climate sensitivity parameter l of about 1.5 K/(W m<font size="-1">-2</font>).
  Note that a climate sensitivity calculated for such small perturbations is associated
  with large uncertainty.</p>
<p>For comparison, <a href="082.htm#img613">Figure 6-13</a> shows the equilibrium
  climate change associated with the anthropogenic increase of well-mixed greenhouse
  gases CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>, CH<font size="-2">4</font>, etc.) from 1990
  to 2015 according to IS92a as simulated with the same model. The associated
  global mean surface temperature change is 0.9 K, and the RF is 1.1 W m<sup>-2</sup>. The
  resulting climate sensitivity parameter, about 0.8 K/(W m<font size="-1">-2</font>),
  is smaller than for the aircraft-induced ozone perturbation. Temperature change
  patterns are quite different for well-mixed greenhouse gases than for the aircraft-induced
  ozone perturbation. </p>
  These and related experiments with the GISS and ECHAM4 models showed that:
  The aircraft-related climate change pattern and the aircraft-related climate
  sensitivity parameters are model-dependent, and the climate response for aircraft-induced
  ozone changes is different from that for conventional greenhouse gases. Internal
  feedback processes within and between climate models appear to work differently.
  The exact nature of the climate feedback differences to different pattern of
  RF remains to be investigated. Thus, the climate factors of human interest,
  especially the regional climate change for these regional perturbations, await
  further development of climate models. The details of the climate response to
  the contrail radiative imbalance, which is spatially heterogeneous on the smallest
  scales, is likewise unknown.<br>
