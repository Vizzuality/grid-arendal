<p>Studies on the effects of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions from aircraft on radiative forcing
  require only a knowledge of total emissions. However, to examine the potential
  effects of other emissions from aviation (e.g., those considered in <a href="044.htm">Chapter
  4</a>), estimates of the amount and the distribution of emissions are required.
  Such 3-D inventories for present and projected future aviation operations have
  been produced under the aegis of NASA's Atmospheric Effects of Aviation Project
  (AEAP), the European Civil Aviation Conference's ANCAT and EC Emissions Inventory
  Database Group (EIDG), and DLR. </p>

<p>These inventories consist of calculated aircraft emissions distributed over
  the world's airspace by latitude, longitude,and altitude. Historical inventories
  of aviation emissions have been produced for 1976 and 1984 by NASA. Present-day
  and 2015 forecast inventories (where present-day is taken to be the most recent
  available-1991-92) have been produced by NASA, ANCAT, and DLR. DLR has also
  produced emissions inventories of scheduled international aviation only for
  each year from 1982 through 1992, and for total scheduled aviation for 1986
  and 1989. DLR has also constructed a four-dimensional (4-D) inventory with diurnal
  cycles for scheduled aviation in March 1992. </p>
<p>All of the aforementioned 3-D emissions inventories have a common approach
  of combining a database of global air traffic (fleet mix, city-pairs served,
  and flight frequencies) with a set of assumptions about flight operations (flightprofiles
  and routing) and a method to calculate altitude-dependent emissions of aircraft/engine
  combinations in the fleet. <a href="134.htm#img95">Figure 9-5</a> shows how these
  processes are combined. </p>
<p>ll of the historical, present-day, and 2015 forecast inventories considered
  in this section assume idealized flight routings and profiles, with no winds
  or system delays. Thus, minimum fuel burn and emissions possible for each flight
  operation are implicit, given the onboard load assumed. Simplifying assumptions
  for military operations vary according to aircraft type. </p>
<h3><a name="931"></a>9.3.1. NASA, ANCAT/EC2, and DLR Historical and Present-Day
  Emissions Inventories</h3>
<p>The NASA, ANCAT, and DLR 3-D inventories adopt a similar overall approach but
  differ in some of the components and data used. This section describes thecommon
  approaches and explains the differences. More detailed information appears in
  the source material for these inventories (Baughcum et al., 1996a,b; Schmitt
  and Brunner, 1997; Gardner, 1998). </p>
<p>All of the inventories use a "bottom-up" approach in which an aircraft movement
  database was compiled, aircraft/engine combinations in operation were identified
  (to differing levels of detail), and calculations of fuel burned and emissions
  along great-circle paths between cities were made. Flight operation data were
  calculated as the number of departures for each city pair by aircraft and engine
  type-which, combined with performance and emissions data, gave fuel burned and
  emissions by altitude along each route. This approach resulted in data on fuel
  burned and emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> (as NO<span class="subscript">2</span>) on a 3-D grid for each flight. In addition,
  the NASA inventories provide 3-D distributions of CO and total HC. NASA and
  ANCAT inventories were calculated on a 1� longitude x 1� latitude x 1-km altitude
  resolution, whereas the DLR inventory used a 2.8� longitude x 2.8� latitude
  horizontal resolution. Different approaches were taken for constructing underlying
  traffic movements databases. The NASA inventories use scheduled jet and turboprop
  aviation operations for the years 1976, 1984, and 1992 (Baughcum et al., 1996a,b).
  Movements for charter carriers, military operations, general aviation, and the
  domestic fleets of the former Soviet Union (FSU) and the People's Republic of
  China were estimated separately (Landau et al., 1994; Metwally, 1995; Mortlock
  and Van Alstyne, 1998). Military aircraft contributions to emissions were calculated
  by estimating the flight activity of each type of military aircraft by country.
  The 1976 and 1984 NASA inventories were based on operations for 1 month in each
  quarter of the year, whereas the 1992 inventory compiled movements on a monthly
  basis to reflect the seasonality of aviation operations. </p>
<p>The ANCAT approach used a combination of air traffic control (ATC) data and
  scheduled movements, favoring ATC data where available (Gardner, 1998). Where
  ATC data were unavailable, scheduled data were taken from the ABC Travel Guide
  (ABC), the Official Airline Guide (OAG), the Aeroflot time table, and a German
  study of Chinese domestic aircraft movements. Only jet aircraft were represented
  in the ANCAT/EC2 inventory. The most significant omission of ATC data was the
  United States, for which data were unavailable for security reasons. Thus, only
  time table data were used for the United States; so nonscheduled U.S. domestic
  charters and other flights were not recorded. To compensate for this problem,
  fuel usage data were factored up by 10% (Gardner, 1998). ATC data accounted
  for half of the non-U.S. aircraft movements in the database. Military movements
  were estimated by allocating fuel and emissions to countries' boundaries from
  an analysis of the world's military fleet composition.</p>
<p>The DLR inventory for 1991/92 (Schmitt and Brunner, 1997) used the ANCAT/EC2
  civil movements database.Emissions inventories for 1986, 1989, and 1992 were
  based on scheduled air traffic only; a 4-D inventory with diurnal cycles for
  March 1992 was based on ABC data. ICAO data (ICAO, 1997b) were used for emissions
  inventories for international (only) scheduled air traffic in the years 1982
  to 1992. </p>
<p>Calculation of fuel burned and emissions for aircraft differs between the three
  inventories. NASA used detailedmanufacturers' proprietary performance information
  on each aircraft-engine combination and the flight profile shown in <a href="134.htm#img96">Figure
  9-6</a>. Emissions were calculated from the information in the ICAO Engine Exhaust
  Emissions Data Bank (ICAO, 1995), through the use of Boeing "Method 2" procedures
  (Baughcum et al., 1996b, Appendix D), which allow extrapolation of sea-level
  data in the ICAO data bank to the operating altitudes and temperatures encountered
  throughout the aircraft flight profile. </p>
<p>The ANCAT/EC2 inventory used commercial software for flight and fuel profiling,
  along with Project Interactive Analysis and Optimization (PIANO), a parametric
  aircraft design model. The global civil fleet was modeled with a selection of
  20 representative aircraft types. These representative aircraft were assumed
  to be fitted with generic engines typical of the technology and thrust requirements
  of each type. PIANO generated fuel profiles covering the entire flight cycle,
  including steps in cruise for each aircraft. Fuel use during ground operations
  was estimated from ICAO certification timings (ICAO, 1993). </p>
<p>The DLR inventory used airline data and an in-house flight and fuel profile
  model (Deidewig et al., 1996). The DLR approach also used different aircraft/engine
  combinations from those utilized by ANCAT. The aircraft mission was simulated
  by using a simplified flight modeling code as point-to-point missions with no
  step cruise. Although the climb was calculated in iterative steps, the cruise
  segment was treated as one section, applying the Breguet formula to calculate
  the cruise fuel. Descent was assumed to be a gliding path with minimum engine
  load; no separate approach procedure was used. A thermodynamic model for design
  and off-design operation of a two-shaft fan engine was applied. Constant efficiencies
  and constant relative pressure losses for main engine components were assumed
  for simplicity. </p>
<p>The ANCAT/EC2 and DLR inventories calculated NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from the fuel using
  the DLR fuel flow method. This method has been tested and correlated with information
  from airlines, flight measurements, and altitude chamber measurements (Deidewig
  et al., 1996; Schulte et al., 1997). </p>
