<h3>6.6.5. Climate Change</h3>
<p>The ranges of aircraft perturbations to climate change examined in this report
  are, of course, small compared to the overall increase in RF expected throughout
  the next century. Climate modeling of this transient change over the next 50
  years cannot readily evaluate aircraft, or any equally small RF, in terms of
  specific climate changes because of problems in separating "signal" from "noise."
  Climate parameters that might be attributed to aircraft, such as the increase
  in global mean surface air temperature, are calculated here using a simple model
  consistent with previous IS92a relationships. </p>

<p>The predicted change in global mean surface temperature is shown in <a href="086.htm#img617">Figure
  6-17</a> for total warming in accord with IS92a (solid) and for the case in
  which all of aviation's contribution to global warming (scenario Fa1) is cut
  off (dotted line). Of total global warming of 0.9 K anticipated in 2050, about
  0.05 K would be attributable to aviation. The Eab case anticipates a larger
  aviation component (0.09 K). One caveat is that aircraft may produce a different
  climate signature, one that is not represented by an increase in global mean
  temperature. </p>
<p>To evaluate individual energy sectors as part of overall climate forcing, it 
  is necessary to compare their summed radiative forcing from all atmospheric 
  perturbations, not just that from their use of fossil-fuel carbon alone. The 
  radiative forcing index-defined here as the ratio of total radiative forcing 
  to that from CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font> emissions 
  alone-is a measure of the importance of aircraft-induced climate change relative 
  to that from an equivalent sector with the same fossil fuel use but without 
  any effect other than CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font> 
  (see also <a href="071.htm#623">Section 6.2.3</a>). In 1992, the RFI for aircraft 
  was about 2.7, with an uncertainty of at least ±1.5. The RFI changes to 3.0 
  by 2015 then drops to 2.6 for the Fa1 scenario (see <a href="068.htm#tab61">Table 
  6-1</a>). This index ranges from 2.2 to 3.4 in the year 2050 for the various 
  E- and F-type scenarios for subsonic aviation and technical options considered 
  here. The RFI increases from 2.6 to 3.4 with the addition of HSCT aircraft (scenario 
  Fa1H), as a result of the effects of stratospheric water vapor. Thus, aircraft-induced 
  climate change with RFI > 1 points to the need for a complete scientific assessment 
  rather than basing the climate impact on the use of fossil fuel alone. For comparison, 
  in the IS92a scenario, the RFI for all human activities is about 1; for greenhouse 
  gases alone it is about 1.5, and it is much higher for sectors emitting CH<font size="-2">4</font> 
  and N<font size="-1">2</font>O without significant fossil fuel use. </p>
<h3>6.6.6. Aviation and Anthropogenic Change<a name="ch666"></a></h3>
<p>The overall positive anthropogenic RF today, leading toward global warming,
  is caused primarily by an increase in anthropogenic emissions of long-lived
  greenhouse gases, countered in part by short-lived aerosols. Much of this radiative
  forcing has built up since the industrial revolution. Emissions from aviation
  are a relatively new contributor to this RF, although they are potentially a
  growing sector. In evaluating climate change forced by aviation, as well as
  that by other industrial sectors, the RFI provides a useful indicator. With
  an RFI of about 3, aviation's role in climate change involves several important
  climate perturbations beyond that from its release of fossil carbon alone.</p>
<p>This report presents the first thorough IPCC climate assessment of any industrial
  or agricultural sector. It includes all known climate forcings, many of which
  are important and not currently represented by indices such as GWP. Comparison
  of aviation to other industries must await an equally thorough evaluation of
  the summed effects of human activities by sector that is not available in IPCC
  (1996) but is anticipated for IPCC's Third Assessment Report in 2001.</p>
<p>The range of technology options that would attempt to reduce the impact of
  aviation on climate did not significantly change radiative forcing by the year
  2050. A lesson taken from the Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996, Figure 6a)
  is that changes in total radiative forcing, even the wide range of emissions
  for the IS92a-f scenarios, do not appear much before year 2050. Thus, subsequent
  climate assessments of 21st century options for civil aviation need to carry
  out projected changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols, and all chemical and
  climate feedbacks, to the year 2100. </p>
