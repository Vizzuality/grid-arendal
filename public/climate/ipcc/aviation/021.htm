<H2><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b></H2>
<p>Aircraft emit a number of chemically active species that can alter the concentration
  of atmospheric ozone. The species with the greatest potential impact are nitric
  oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<span class="subscript">2</span>) (collectively termed NO<span class="subscript">x</span>), sulfur oxides,
  water, and soot. </p>
<p>Ozone concentrations in the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere are
  expected to increase in response to NO<span class="subscript">x</span> increases and decrease in response to
  sulfur and water increases. At higher altitudes, increases in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> lead to decreases
  in ozone. </p>
<p>Soot surfaces destroy ozone and possibly convert nitric acid to NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. However,
  because atmospheric soot reactions are highly unlikely to be catalytic and because
  ambient soot concentrations are low, the effect on ambient ozone is expected
  to be negligible. </p>
<p>Soot surfaces destroy ozone and possibly convert nitric acid to NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. However,
  because atmospheric soot reactions are highly unlikely to be catalytic and because
  ambient soot concentrations are low, the effect on ambient ozone is expected
  to be negligible. </p>
<p>Aircraft emissions are calculated to have increased NO<span class="subscript">x</span> at cruise altitudes
  in northern mid-latitudes by approximately 20%. The uncertainty in this calculation
  is primarily related to uncertainties in the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> chemical lifetime and in the
  relative magnitude of the aircraft source compared to lightning, rapid vertical
  convection of surface NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and other sources of upper tropospheric NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. The
  calculated increase is substantially smaller than the observed variability in
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. </p>
<p>NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from current aircraft are calculated to have increased ozone
  by about 6% in the region 30-60&#176;N latitude and 9-13 km altitude. Calculated
  total ozone column changes in this latitude range are approximately 0.4%. Calculated
  effects are substantially smaller outside this region. Some of the uncertainty
  in these calculations is captured by the range of model results. However, the
  models are notably deficient in coupling representations of stratospheric and
  tropospheric chemistry and in describing exhaust plume processes, HO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources,
  and non-methane chemistry in the upper troposphere. In addition, there is high
  uncertainty associated with the model description of vertical and horizontal
  transport in the upper troposphere/ lower stratosphere. </p>
<p>The effect of current aircraft particle and particle precursor emissions (i.e.,
  soot, sulfur, and water) in the stratosphere on ozone is estimated to be smaller
  than, and of opposite sign to, the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> effect. Model representations of aerosol
  microphysics and chemistry are, however, largely incomplete. </p>
<p>Aircraft-related increases in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the upper troposphere are calculated to
  increase the concentration of hydroxyl (OH) radicals by a few percent throughout
  the Northern Hemisphere. The OH change results in a corresponding decrease in
  the concentration of methane (CH<span class="subscript">4</span>). Uncertainties in the global budget of CH<span class="subscript">4</span>
  and the factors that control OH preclude testing this calculation with atmospheric
  observations. Because the chemical processes that lead to the reduction of CH<span class="subscript">4</span>
  are the same processes that increase ozone, calculated CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and ozone effects
  are correlated.</p>
