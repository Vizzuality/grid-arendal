<h2><b>4.1. Introduction </b></h2>
<p>To assess the impact on the chemical composition of the atmosphere from a current
  and future fleet of aircraft, it is necessary to take the following steps: </p>
<ul>
  <p>Identify emissions associated with aircraft operation <br>
    Evaluate how each emission would change concentration of corresponding species
    in the atmosphere <br>
    Determine how those changes could alter concentrations of other species in
    the atmosphere. </p>
</ul>
<p>For aircraft with conventional engines that use hydrocarbon fuels, emissions
  include H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, carbon dioxide CO<span class="subscript">2</span>), NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, oxidation products from sulfur impurities,
  hydrocarbons, carbon moNO<span class="subscript">x</span>ide (CO), and soot. These products have the potential
  to perturb the atmosphere if their emissions are large enough to change background
  concentrations substantially. Other emissions, such as metallic particulates
  from engine wear and paints, have been considered and are thought to have minimal
  atmospheric effects (Stolarski and Wesoky, 1993). One environmental concern
  is how emissions could affect O<span class="subscript">3</span> in the atmosphere-both in their potential to
  deplete O<span class="subscript">3</span> in the lower stratosphere, leading to increases in UV-B radiation
  at the ground, and in their potential to increase O<span class="subscript">3</span> in the upper troposphere,
  leading to greenhouse warming. In addition, increases in water vapor in the
  LS could have a direct effect on radiative balance as well as chemistry. </p>
<p>To evaluate how emission of a species could change its background concentration,
  one could estimate the expected change in concentration from emission rate and
  residence time and compare that with the background concentration, or one could
  compare the emission rate directly with sources that sustain the background
  concentration. Consideration of either criterion points to different impacts
  from material emitted either to the UT or the LS. The residence time for material
  emitted in the UT is typically on the order of weeks, whereas residence time
  in the LS is on the order of months to a few years (Johnston, 1989). For NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, background sources also differ in the UT and LS. In the UT, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is
  affected by surface sources as well as lightning sources in the whole troposphere.
  In contrast, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the LS is sustained by downward transport of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and nitric
  acid (HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>) from the middle stratosphere and transport of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> produced by lightning
  in the tropical UT. In the case of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, the background concentration in the
  UT is orders of magnitude larger than that in the LS. </p>
<p>The character of the O<span class="subscript">3</span> budget is also very different in the UT and LS. In
  the UT, the transport and chemical time scales are on the order of weeks. The
  chemical transformation is dominated by reactions among oxides of hydrogen (HO<span class="subscript">x</span>)
  and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> radicals, which affect local production and removal rates of O<span class="subscript">3</span>. Local
  concentrations of HO<span class="subscript">x</span> species in the UT are controlled by concentrations of
  water, hydrocarbons, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and CO, each of which is affected by how contributions
  from surface sources are redistributed in the UT by convection. In the LS, transport
  and chemical time scales are on the order of months. The O<span class="subscript">3</span> budget in the LS
  is maintained by a balance between transport and chemistry (chemical production
  balanced by transport out of the region in the tropical LS, and chemical removal
  balanced by transport into the region in the mid-latitude LS). Addition of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O to the LS would modify the chemical production and destruction rates
  of O<span class="subscript">3</span>. However, the efficiency of the added radicals in removing O<span class="subscript">3</span> is dependent
  on the amount of chlorine radicals in the background atmosphere and the extent
  of surface reactions that occur on sulfate particles and polar stratospheric
  clouds (PSCs). Previous modeling studies (Danilin et al., 1997; Weisenstein
  et al., 1998) have shown that sulfur emissions from supersonic aircraft can
  increase the surface area of the sulfate layer by about 50% in the Northern
  Hemisphere LS. Effects from the current subsonic fleet are less clear. Subsonic
  aircraft cruise in the troposphere or the very lowest part of the stratosphere
  (just above the tropopause); thus, the stratospheric impact from subsonic aircraft
  sulfur emissions would probably be less than that computed for the projected
  supersonic fleet. Whether any observed trend in the sulfate layer in the past
  decade can be ascribed to subsonic aircraft is currently under debate (see Hofmann,
  1991, and <a href="036.htm#3341">Section 3.3.4.1</a>). The amount of PSCs also
  would be increased as a result of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from aircraft (see <a href="037.htm#336">Section
  3.3.6</a>). </p>
<p>Numerical models of the atmosphere are used to calculate these changes. By
  solving a system of equations, these models simulate the transport and chemical
  interactions of trace gases to obtain their spatial and seasonal distributions.
  A typical model keeps track of the distributions of 50 species that interact
  via more than 100 reactions. Transport in the models is driven by winds and
  parameterization of mixing, which change with seasons. There are several ways
  to classify the models into different classes. One is by dimensionality: Two-dimensional
  (2-D) versus three-dimensional (3-D). 3-D models simulate the distributions
  of trace gases as functions of altitude, latitude, longitude, as well as season.
  2-D models of the stratosphere simulate the zonal mean (averaged over longitudes)
  concentrations of species, taking advantage of the fact that many of the trace
  gases have uniform concentrations along latitude circles in the stratosphere.
  Another way to distinguish different types of models is to note whether the
  transport circulation is fixed or calculated in a consistent way with the model-generated
  trace gas concentrations. </p>
<p>General circulation models (GCMs) calculate temperature and transport circulation
  along with chemical composition. Alternatively, chemistry-transport models (CTMs)
  simulate the distribution of trace gases using temperature and transport circulation
  either from pre-calculated GCM results or derived from observations. </p>
<p>Because of intrinsic differences in chemistry and dynamics that control O<span class="subscript">3</span>
  and precursor species in the UT and LS, different models have been developed
  to examine the different regions. Models for the troposphere require better
  resolution immediately above the planetary boundary layer and a proper description
  of convection that carries material from the boundary layer to the free troposphere.
  The chemical scheme in these models places more emphasis on the role of non-methane
  hydrocarbons (NMHCs), acetone, and peroxyacetalnitrate (PAN). Models with emphasis
  on the stratosphere concentrate on large-scale transport from the equatorial
  LS to the mid-latitudes and the exchange of material between the stratosphere
  and the UT. The chemical scheme pays more attention to the coupling between
  the nitrogen, hydrogen, and halogen species and their sources in the stratosphere.
  The computation requirements are such that it has not been possible to develop
  a model that will treat both the UT and the LS in a satisfactory manner. Historically,
  two sets of models have been used to evaluate aircraft impact in the UT and
  LS. This approach is clearly unsatisfactory because a portion of the subsonic
  fleet operates in the LS. In this report, we essentially continue to use this
  approach. </p>
<p>A large number of model studies of the impact of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from subsonic
  aircraft have been performed over the past 20 years (see <a href="020.htm">Chapter
  2</a> for an overview). During the past few years, these studies have been based
  on 3-D CTMs. Recent assessments of the atmospheric effects of aircraft emissions
  were completed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (Friedl,
  1997) and the European Community (Brasseur et al., 1998). For these reports,
  3-D CTM studies of the ozone perturbation from the present-day aircraft fleet
  were performed with several models. The model studies used the NASA database
  in Friedl (1997) and the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Aerospace
  Center) (DLR)-2 (Schmitt and Brunner, 1997) database in Brasseur et al. (1998).
  Although there are clear differences in the calculated perturbations caused
  by aircraft emissions, all model calculations show significant increases in
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> concentration in the UT (up to 100% above those calculated without aircraft)
  in the latitude band where traffic is most frequent (30-60°N). Corresponding
  increases in O<span class="subscript">3</span> concentration in the UT are up to 10% above those calculated
  without aircraft. Comparisons revealed significant differences in calculated
  O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbations among models, both in magnitude and in seasonal variation.
</p>
<p>A projected fleet of high speed civil transport (HSCT) aircraft would fly at
  supersonic speeds in the LS at altitudes where stratospheric O<span class="subscript">3</span> concentrations
  are large and particularly vulnerable to emissions from these aircraft. The
  effects of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions from this projected fleet on stratospheric
  ozone were thought to be most important when NASA's Atmospheric Effects of Stratospheric
  Aircraft (AESA) program started in 1989 (Prather et al., 1992). Projected changes
  in the O<span class="subscript">3</span> column as a result of aircraft emission of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O from six 2-D
  models were presented by Stolarski et al. (1995) for various scenarios of fleet
  size and EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) in g NO<span class="subscript">2</span> kg<sup>-1</sup> fuel. The model predictions in Stolarski et al.
  (1995) showed generally that supersonic fleet sizes of 500-1,000 aircraft would
  result in some depletion of Northern Hemisphere averaged total column O<span class="subscript">3</span>. More
  recently, the role of SO<span class="subscript">2</span> aircraft emissions has been studied carefully and
  found to have a potentially major influence on resultant O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbation computed
  in models (Weisenstein et al., 1996, 1998). </p>
<p>The new model studies in this chapter focus on the impact on atmospheric chemical
  composition from a current and future fleet of subsonic aircraft flying in the
  UT and LS, and include a fleet of supersonic aircraft flying in the LS in one
  of the technology options. In the case of subsonic traffic, the estimated impact
  on atmospheric composition is based on 3-D CTMs; in the case of supersonic transports,
  the estimated impact is based on a combination of 2-D and 3-D CTMs. </p>

<p>This chapter has many ties to other chapters in this document. The aircraft
  fleet emissions used in model computations for current (circa 1992) and future
  (roughly 2015 and 2050) aircraft are described in <a href="130.htm">Chapter
  9</a>. A discussion of the validity of models used here to accurately represent
  the present atmosphere is contained in <a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>. Information
  about the interaction between aerosols and aircraft emissions is presented in
  <a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a>. Model computations of the distribution of a
  passive tracer emitted according to aircraft fuel burn are also presented in
  <a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a>, and are used here to generate soot distributions
  by scaling to EI(soot). This tracer experiment is also used to evaluate the
  different transport characteristics of the models with respect to stratosphere-troposphere
  exchange and upper tropospheric mixing. Results presented in this chapter are
  incorporated in Chapters <a href="054.htm">5</a> and <a href="063.htm">6</a>.
</p>
<p>An evaluation of the effects of subsonic and supersonic engine effluent on
  atmospheric trace constituents is presented in Sections <a href="047.htm">4.2</a>
  and <a href="049.htm">4.3</a>, respectively. A discussion of uncertainties in
  model results is given in <a href="051.htm">Section 4.4</a>, and a discussion
  concerning the selection of model simulations used for some of the computations
  in Chapters <a href="054.htm">5</a> and <a href="063.htm">6</a> is presented
