<h2><b>4.5. Selection of Model Runs for UV (<a href="054.htm">Chapter 5</a>)
  and Climate Impact (<a href="063.htm">Chapter 6</a>) Scenario Studies </b></h2>
In this section, the model results that are used as a guide for the ultraviolet
B (UV-B) impact (<a href="054.htm">Chapter 5</a>) and the estimation of climate
impact (<a href="063.htm">Chapter 6</a>) are selected and uncertainties are assigned
in light of the discussion in <a href="051.htm">Section 4.4</a>. A key uncertainty
in assessing the impact of subsonic and supersonic exhaust emissions is that all
models used to assess the aircraft impact are either tropospheric models with
limited representation of stratospheric chemistry and transport (tropospheric
3-D CTMs), or stratospheric 2-D and 3-D CTMs with limited representation of tropospheric
processes. In addition, neither the 2-D nor the 3-D models have been designed
to deal specifically with transport processes in the tropopause region, where
most aircraft emissions take place.
<h3><i><b><a name="451"></a>4.5.1. Model Simulations of Subsonic Aircraft </b></i></h3>
<p>How well can we calculate the impact from subsonic aircraft in the tropopause
  region using the tropospheric 3-D CTMs or the stratospheric 2-D models? For
  these aircraft, part of the perturbation occurs in the LS and part in the UT.
</p>
<p>As discussed in <a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>, based on the limited set of 
  observational data that could be chosen for model validation, none of the 3-D 
  CTMs could be picked as the best assessment model for impact studies of future 
  aircraft emissions. The UiO 3-D model was selected as a representative model 
  for the UV (<a href="054.htm">Chapter 5</a>) and climate impact studies (<a href="063.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>), because it gave results in the middle range of model results and it 
  was easily available for sensitivity studies. Height profiles for 30-60°N zonal 
  mean O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbations for 1992 subsonic emissions 
  (Scenario B-A in <a href="047.htm#tab44">Table 4-4</a>) obtained with the AER 
  2-D model and the UiO 3-D model are shown in <a href="051.htm#img410">Figure 4-10a</a>. 
  There is reasonable agreement between the two models in the 8-12 km region, 
  near the tropopause. The UiO 3-D model, whose chemistry is most suited to the 
  troposphere, shows a smaller O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbation 
  in the middle and lowest troposphere. The AER 2-D model, whose chemistry is 
  most suited to the stratosphere, shows a larger O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  perturbation in the LS. An uncertainty range of a factor of 2 was adopted for 
  O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbation from future subsonic aircraft 
  emissions. This uncertainty range was based on the range of model results obtained 
  by participating models in basic perturbation studies and results from the limited 
  number of sensitivity studies. A "fair" confidence is associated with this uncertainty 
  range for 2015, and a "poor" confidence is associated with this uncertainty 
  range for 2050. </p>
<p><a href="051.htm#img410">Figure 4-10b</a> shows zonal mean O<span class="subscript">3</span> changes for five
  calculations from the UiO 3-D model. As illustrated in the figure, predicted
  changes in O<span class="subscript">3</span> from subsonic aircraft are comparable to changes from surface
  sources in 2015 and 2050. </p>
<h3><b><i><a name="452"></a>4.5.2. Model Simulations of Supersonic Aircraft </i></b></h3>
<p>The basic assumption in market studies that determine the routing and size
  of the supersonic fleet is that the supersonic fleet will replace certain routes
  of the given subsonic fleet, corresponding to about 10% of the subsonic fuel
  burn. The results of these studies were used to generate the fuel burn for a
  combined fleet consisting of a supersonic fleet with a modified subsonic fleet.
  For this reason, it is more appropriate to compare the effect of the combined
  fleet to the subsonic fleet, rather than to look at the supersonic fleet in
  isolation. Taking 2015 as an example, numerical results were generated for the
  2015 atmosphere without aircraft (scenario C), the 2015 atmosphere with the
  standard subsonic fleet (scenario D), and the 2015 atmosphere with the combined
  fleet (scenario S1k). Recognizing the uncertainties concerning the tropospheric
  response generated by the stratospheric models, the strategy is to use the change
  in O<span class="subscript">3</span> computed between S1k and D and the results from the tropospheric models
  from scenario D minus scenario C for the effect of the subsonic fleet, after
  adjusting for the 10% difference in fuel burn. </p>
<p>For supersonic aircraft influences on UV effects (<a href="054.htm">Chapter
  5</a>) and radiative forcing and climate change (<a href="063.htm">Chapter 6</a>),
  we have chosen a central or most probable emission scenario (S1k-2015 and S9h-2050),
  along with a representative assessment model (AER). This emission scenario assumes
  a SO<span class="subscript">2</span> gas-to-particle conversion of 10%. The AER model was selected because
  it was the model that calculated and supplied the enhanced gas-to-particle sulfate
  aerosol SAD that was used in all participating assessment models. The middle
  plot in <a href="051.htm#img411">Figure 4-11</a> shows the percentage change in
  column O<span class="subscript">3</span> for the AER model using the S1k scenario. At all latitudes and months,
  the AER model derives a reduction in total column O<span class="subscript">3</span>. </p>
<p>Because of coupling between chemistry and transport, there is no simple way
  to scale O<span class="subscript">3</span> change profiles based on a priori estimates of uncertainties. It
  is possible to get an idea of the uncertainties by looking at the assembly of
  results from various scenarios performed by different models. Concentrating
  on the first group of scenarios in <a href="049.htm#tab411">Table 4-11</a> (which
  represent a 500-plane Mach 2.4 fleet with EI(NOx)=5 flying in a clean sulfate
  background), we picked S1c from UNIVAQ and S1h from GSFC as representative of
  the range of possible results. The differences in computed O<span class="subscript">3</span> changes by the
  AER, UNIVAQ, and GSFC models in northern mid-latitudes are illustrated in <a href="051.htm#img412">Figure
  4-12a</a> for 2015. The UNIVAQ and GSFC models were picked because these models
  represent different ways of treating transport and PSCs that consistently produce
  the smallest and largest O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion in most scenarios. The sampling of scenarios
  also covers the possible range of effects from different assumptions of gas-to-particle
  conversion in plume processing of SO<span class="subscript">2</span> emission. For 2050, we focus on a 1,000-plane
  Mach 2.4 fleet with EI(NOx)=5. The AER S9h scenario is taken as the central
  case, and the lower and upper extremes were taken to be S9d for UNIVAQ and S9f
  for GSFC. The differences in O<span class="subscript">3</span> changes computed by the AER, UNIVAQ, and GSFC
  models in northern mid-latitudes are illustrated in <a href="051.htm#img412">Figure
  4-12b</a> for 2050. </p>
<p>It is also important to note which uncertainties, among those discussed in
  Chapters <a href="020.htm">2</a> and <a href="031.htm">3</a>, are not included
  in this range. All of the models used rate data from DeMore et al. (1997). A
  previous study (described in Stolarski et al., 1995) showed that uncertainties
  in rate data could lead to an uncertainty in NH O<span class="subscript">3</span> column change of ±1%. Current
  studies indicate that most models underestimate the mean age of air as defined
  by inert tracers that enter the stratosphere via the tropical tropopause. Given
  that there appears to be a positive correlation between calculated increases
  in NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O from HSCT and calculated mean age, it has been suggested that
  models that underestimate age will also underestimate NOy and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O increases
  from HSCT. It is difficult to quantify the uncertainty given current information.
  We did not consider the effect of plume processing and possible changes (in
  temperature and transport circulation) in the future background atmosphere.
  Finally, the range cited does not include different technology options for different
  EI(NOx), different cruise altitudes, and different fleet sizes. </p>
<p>It is possible to arrive at a subjective estimate for uncertainty estimates
  for changes in column O<span class="subscript">3</span>. This value can be used to calculate changes in UV
  because that depends mostly on the changes in column in the lower stratosphere.
  It is less obvious whether this value can be used to estimate uncertainties
  in radiative forcing. Restricting ourselves to the 1,000-plane Mach 2.4 fleet
  with EI(NOx)=5, the range of model results for annual averaged Northern Hemisphere
  column O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion is -0.1% to -1.4% (see <a href="049.htm#tab412">Table 4-12</a>).
  Other model studies lead us to believe that reasonable changes in the background
  atmosphere (including background sulfate surface area) would not change this
  range in a significant way. Uncertainties in rate data would expand the range
  to about +1 to -2.5%. One may also argue that the inability of the models to
  simulate the correct mean age may add to uncertainties on the negative side
  by another 1%. Thus, a subjective estimate is that actual atmospheric response
  would likely lie between +1 and -3.5%. </p>
<p>A 500-plane Mach 2.4 fleet with EI(NOx)=5 would have a similar range of uncertainty.
  Here, the range of model results for annual averaged Northern Hemisphere column
  O<span class="subscript">3</span> depletion is 0 to -1.3% (see <a href="049.htm#tab411">Table 4.11</a>)-very
  close to the -0.1 to -1.4% model range for 1,000 planes. Applying the same arguments
  for this 500-plane fleet, a subjective estimate for the actual atmospheric response
  would likely be in the range of +1 to -3.5%. We have "fair" confidence in this
  range for the 500-plane and 1,000-plane fleets. </p>
