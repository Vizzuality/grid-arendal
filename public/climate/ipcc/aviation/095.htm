<h2>7.4. Engine Performance and Technology</h2>
<p>For the past 50 years, the principal propulsion source for military and civil
  aircraft has been the gas turbine. For a variety of technical reasons, this
  situation is likely to continue into the foreseeable future. The earliest military
  aircraft gas turbines, developed toward the end of World War II, opened the
  way to high-speed flight by providing high power from low weight, compact engines.
  For military use, these "jet" engines offered an escape from the aerodynamic
  limitation of the propeller, despite their relatively low thermodynamic efficiency
  at the time. Early civil aircraft gas turbines continued, at first, to use the
  engine to drive a propeller in so-called turbo-prop form (engine shown in <a href="094.htm#img77">Figure
  7-7a</a>). Several types of turbo-props are still used for short-haul operations
  where cruise speeds are less important, but larger and faster aircraft have
  dispensed with the propeller. </p>
<p>Since those early days, huge strides have been made in the critical and pacing
  technology fields that influence the key design and performance characteristics
  of engine design. In particular, major advances have been made in the fields
  of turbo-machinery aerodynamics, combustion, turbine blade cooling, and materials.
  For military engines, these advances have been realized mainly in increases
  in the ratio of engine thrust to engine weight. For civil aircraft engines,
  the benefits have led to high bypass ratio engines with substantially lower
  fuel consumption, which have contributed to the rapid growth in air transportation
  over the past 3 decades.</p>
<p>It is common to compare engines in terms of specific fuel consumption (SFC),
  which is the fuel flow rate per unit thrust at cruise. However, the ultimate
  goal is to minimize total fuel burned per unit payload, rather than SFC; this
  computation involves engine weight, installation drag, and their effect on the
  total fuel required to complete a flight mission. For subsonic transport aircraft,
  the weight of the engines is on the order of 10-15% of the empty weight of the
  aircraft; a reduction of one unit of total engine weight translates to a reduction
  of between 1.5 and 4 units of aircraft empty weight, depending on the design.
  The relatively larger reduction in aircraft weight derives from concomitant
  reductions in requirements for supporting structure. The benefits are further
  magnified by the fact that the reduction in fuel burn attributable to engine
  weight savings is proportional to increasing aircraft range. </p>
<p>The following subsections present a brief outline of engine performance issues
  from an historical perspective (<a href="097.htm#742">7.4.2</a>) and a look
  forward into the future (<a href="098.htm">7.4.3</a>). The link between performance
  considerations and emissions is discussed in Section 7.4.4. Because the gas
  turbine is expected to remain the principal power source for aircraft propulsion
  well into the future, however, <a href="095.htm#741">Section 7.4.1</a> presents
  a simplified review of the engine's fundamental principles to explain, among
  other things, why there is no reasonable alternative to the gas turbine or derivatives
  thereof in the foreseeable future. </p>

<p>The core of the basic gas turbine consists of three essential elements: The
  compressor, which mechanically increases the energy of the air (raising the
  pressure and temperature); the combustor, in which fuel is burned (further raising
  the temperature of the pressurized air); and the turbine, which mechanically
  extracts enough energy from the hot compressed gas to drive the compressor (thereby
  reducing the pressure and temperature of the gas). A fraction of the net energy
  remaining in the gas after it leaves the turbine is then available to be used
  in different ways, as shown in <a href="094.htm#img77">Figure 7-7</a>. Case
  (a) uses an additional turbine stage to mechanically convert the energy to shaft
  work (such as might be required to drive a propeller or electric generator);
  case (b) is the turbojet, in which a nozzle is used to accelerate the gas (converting
  some of the energy into kinetic energy), producing a high-speed jet that can
  be used to propel the vehicle; and case (c) is the turbofan, in which a further
  turbine converts most of the energy of the gas into shaft work to drive the
  bypass air compressor, thereby producing the bypass jet that propels the vehicle.
  For aircraft applications, the weight of the engine must be low in relation
  to the power output. This constraint has kept the aircraft type of gas turbine
  simple-much simpler than those now being built for land-based power generation.
  (The implications of going to more complicated configurations are considered
  briefly in Section 7.4.4.) </p>
  The overall efficiency of an aircraft engine, h<SPAN class="subscript">0</span>, 
  is the mechanical power created by the thrust divided by the energy input rate of 
  the fuel flow. It is convenient to express overall efficiencies by 
  h<SPAN class="subscript">0</span> = h<SPAN class="subscript">therm</span> x 
  h<SPAN class="subscript">p</span>, where h<SPAN class="subscript">therm</span> is 
  the thermal efficiency and hp is the propulsion efficiency; these terms are 
  considered below.<br>
