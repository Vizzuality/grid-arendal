<h2>7.5. Combustion Technology</h2>
<h3>7.5.1. Introduction</h3>
<p><a href="095.htm">Section 7.4</a> explained how major improvements in the fuel
  efficiency of engines have been achieved through parallel advances in turbomachinery
  aerodynamics, combustion, cooling, and materials. Significant progress in each
  of these areas is the direct result of industrial and governmental investment
  in balanced, interdependent research and technology programs that respond to
  commercial and environmental pressures. This section focuses on combustion technology,
  with particular emphasis on achievements to reduce emissions and the prospects
  of further improvements. </p>
<p>We first describe the modern gas turbine combustion system and the particular
  requirements placed upon this important engine component. Next we address emissions
  from combustors. In view of the wide availability of excellent reference material
  on this subject, however, only a brief assessment of the principal emissions
  is given here. A new emphasis has been placed on current research aimed at improving
  the understanding of soot formation and aerosols, a matter of increasing importance
  (see <a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a>). We then outline progress made in reducing
  emissions in recent years. We go on to describe the specific part the combustor
  plays in controlling NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from engines and discuss prospects and plans
  for further improvements.</p>

<h3>7.5.2. The Gas Turbine Combustion System<a name="752"></a></h3>
<p>In the cross-sectional drawing of a modern civil aircraft engine (<a href="098.htm#img713">Figure
  7-13</a>), the combustor is shown in its central position between the compressor
  and turbine. High-pressure air enters the combustor at a relatively high velocity.
  The air is first carefully decelerated to minimize pressure losses, then forced
  into the combustion chamber, where fuel is added. The combustion chamber is
  designed to allow time and space for the fuel and air to mix thoroughly and
  burn efficiently before entering the turbine stages. Detailed design features
  of the combustor control the complex burning processes, thus the completeness
  of the chemical reactions involved and the nature and scale of individual emissions
  from the engine. Therefore, the combustor has a key role in determining the
  impact of aircraft on climate.</p>
<h4>7.5.2.1. Combustor Features and Requirements<a name="7521"></a></h4>
<p>Aircraft engine combustors must meet the special requirements of operations
  over a very wide range of pressures and temperatures. The combustor must be
  able to ignite and accelerate the engine over a wide operational envelope. For
  instance, it must be able to ignite at high altitude (up to 9 km) after an unscheduled
  shutdown when the air is very cold (e.g., 220 K) and pressure is low (e.g.,
  0.03 MPa). It must also be able to maintain stable burning over a very wide
  range of air velocities and fuel/air ratios to prevent "flameout" during engine
  deceleration. At the other end of the power range, when pressures and temperatures
  are very high, the combustor must be able to burn fuel so that turbine components
  are presented with a smooth temperature profile, to minimize damage to the blades
  and vanes and thereby maximize service life. Together, these requirements present
  a major engineering challenge because the simplest solutions to meet requirements
  at one end of the operational envelope often conflict with those required at
  the other. Relatively recent emissions requirements have added considerably
  to the time and cost of developing combustors that fully satisfy the operational
  and environmental requirements placed on today's aircraft. </p>

<p>Future combustors are likely to face even more challenging requirements as
  manufacturers respond to the continuing need to increase fuel efficiency. As
  explained in <a href="095.htm#741">Section 7.4.1</a>, higher cycle pressure
  ratios lead to improved engine fuel efficiency. However, the compressor delivery/combustor
  inlet air temperatures rise, reducing the cooling capacity of the air. A greater
  proportion of total airflow is then needed to cool the hottest parts (liners,
  blades, etc.). In turn, this requirement reduces airflow available for primary
  combustion and dilution, making it more difficult to control turbine inlet temperature
  profiles and emission levels. This cycle of primary and secondary problems,
  which stem from increases in engine pressure ratios, can be broken only by continuously
  improving the effectiveness of cooling techniques and devices and/or the use
  of new and improved materials. </p>
