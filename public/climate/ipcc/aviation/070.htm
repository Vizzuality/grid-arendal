<h2>6.2. Radiative Forcing and GWP Concepts</h2>
<a name="621"></a>
<h3>6.2.1. The Concept of Radiative Forcing</h3>
<p>The most useful assessment of the impact of the aircraft fleet on climate would
  be a comprehensive prediction of changes to the climate system, including temperature,
  sea level, frequency of severe weather, and so forth. Such assessment is difficult
  to achieve given the current state of climate models and the small global forcing
  of climate attributable to the single sector of aviation chosen for this special
  report (see discussion in <a href="065.htm">Sections 6.1</a> and <a href="081.htm">6.5</a>).
  Following IPCC (1995, 1996), we choose a single measure of climate change: radiative
  forcing (RF), which is calculated directly from changes in greenhouse gases,
  aerosols, and clouds, and which allows ready comparison of the climate impact
  of different aviation scenarios.</p>
<p>The Earth's climate system is powered by the sun. Our planet intercepts 340
  W m<font size="-1">-2</font> of solar radiation averaged over the surface of
  the globe. About 100 W m<font size="-1">-2</font> is reflected to space, and
  the remainder-about 240 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>-heats the planet. On a
  global average, the Earth maintains a radiative balance between this solar heating
  and the cooling from terrestrial infrared radiation that escapes to space. When
  a particular human activity alters greenhouse gases, particles, or land albedo,
  such activity results in radiative imbalance. Such an imbalance cannot be maintained
  for long, and the climate system-primarily the temperature and clouds of the
  lower atmosphere-adjusts to restore radiative balance. We calculate the global,
  annual average of radiative imbalance (W m<font size="-1">-2</font>) to the
  atmosphere-land-ocean system caused by anthropogenic perturbations and designate
  that change radiative forcing. Thus, by this IPCC definition, the RF of the
  pre-industrial atmosphere is taken to be zero. (Although the term "radiative
  forcing" has more general meaning in terms of climate, we restrict its use here
  to the IPCC definition.)</p>
<p>As an example, burning of fossil fuel adds the greenhouse gas CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>
  to the atmosphere; this burning is responsible for the increase in atmospheric
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font> from about 280 ppmv in the pre-industrial atmosphere
  to about 360 ppmv in 1995. Added CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font> increases the infrared
  opaqueness of the atmosphere, thereby reducing terrestrial cooling with little
  impact on solar heating. Thus, the radiative imbalance created by adding a greenhouse
  gas is a positive RF. A positive RF leads to warming of the lower atmosphere
  in order to increase the terrestrial radiation and restore radiative balance.
  Radiative imbalances can also occur naturally, as in the case of the massive
  perturbation to stratospheric aerosols caused by Mt. Pinatubo (Hansen et al.,
  1996).</p>
<p>Because most of the troposphere is coupled to the surface through convection,
  climate models typically predict that the land surface, ocean mixed layer, and
  troposphere together respond to positive RF in general with a relatively uniform
  increase in temperature. Global mean surface temperature is a first-order measure
  of what we consider to be "climate," and its change is roughly proportional
  to RF. The increase in mean surface temperature per unit RF is termed climate
  sensitivity; it includes feedbacks within the climate system, such as changes
  in tropospheric water vapor and clouds in a warmer climate. The RF providing
  the best metric of climate change is the radiative imbalance of this land-ocean-troposphere
  climate system-that is, the RF integrated at the tropopause. </p>
<p>When radiative perturbation occurs above the tropopause, in the stratosphere
  (as for most HSCT impacts), this heating/cooling is not rapidly transported
  into the troposphere, and the imbalance leads mostly to changes in local temperatures
  that restore the radiative balance within the stratosphere. Such changes in
  stratospheric temperature, however, alter the tropospheric cooling; for example,
  warmer stratospheric temperatures lead to a warmer troposphere and climate system.
  This adjustment of stratospheric temperatures can be an important factor in
  calculating RF and is denoted "stratosphere-adjusted."</p>
<p>All RF values used in this report refer to "stratosphere-adjusted, tropopause
  RF" (Shine et al., 1995). For primarily tropospheric perturbations (e.g., CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>
  from all aviation, O<font size="-2">3</font> from subsonic aircraft), this quantity
  can be calculated with reasonable agreement (better than 25%) across models
  used in this report (see <a href="072.htm">Section 6.3</a>). For specifically
  stratospheric perturbations (e.g., H<font size="-2">2</font>O and O<font size="-2">3</font>
  perturbations from HSCT aircraft), the definition of the tropopause and the
  calculation of stratospheric adjustment introduce significant sources of uncertainty
  in calculated RF. </p>
<p>The concept of radiative forcing (IPCC, 1990, 1992, 1995) is based on climate
  model calculations that show that there is an approximately linear relationship
  between global-mean RF at the tropopause and the change in equilibrium global
  mean surface (air) temperature (�Ts ). In mapping RF to climate change, the
  complexities of regional and even hemispheric climate change have been compressed
  into a single quantity-global mean surface temperature. It is clear from climate
  studies that the climate does not change uniformly: Some regions warm or cool
  more than others. Furthermore, mean temperature does not provide information
  about aspects of climate change such as floods, droughts, and severe storms
  that cause the most damage. In the case of aviation, the radiative imbalance
  driven by perturbations to contrails, O<font size="-2">3</font>, and stratospheric
  H<font size="-2">2</font>O occurs predominantly in northern mid-latitudes and
  is not globally homogeneously distributed (see <a href="020.htm">Chapters 2</a>,
  <a href="031.htm">3</a>, and <a href="044.htm">4</a>), unlike perturbations
  driven by increases in CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font> or decreases in CH<font size="-2">4</font>.
  Does this large north-south gradient in the radiative imbalance lead to climate
  change of a different nature than for well-mixed gases? IPCC (Kattenberg et
  al., 1996) considered the issue of whether negative RF from fossil-fuel sulfate
  aerosols (concentrated in industrial regions) would partly cancel positive RF
  from increases in CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font> (global). Studies generally confirmed
  that global mean surface warming from both perturbations was additive; that
  is, it could be estimated from the summed RF. Local RF from sulfate in northern
  industrial regions was felt globally. Nevertheless, the regional patterns in
  both cases were significantly different, and obvious cooling (in a globally
  warming climate) occurred in specific regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Such
  differences in climate change patterns are critical to the detection of anthropogenic
  climate change, as reported in Santer et al. (1996). As a further complication
  of this assessment, aviation's perturbation occurs primarily in the upper troposphere
  and lower stratosphere, and thus may alter the vertical profile of any future
  tropospheric warming. Therefore, the patterns of climate change from individual
  aviation perturbations (e.g., CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>, O<font size="-2">3</font>,
  contrails) would likely differ, but we take their summed RF as a first-order
  measure of the global mean climate change (see also the discussion in <a href="081.htm">Section
  6.5</a>). </p>
<p>The equilibrium change in mean surface air temperature (�Ts(equil)) in response
  to any particular RF is reached only after more than a century because of the
  thermal inertia of the climate system (primarily the oceans) and is calculated
  with long-term integrations of coupled general circulation models (CGCM). A
  climate sensitivity parameter (l) relates RF to temperature change: �Ts(equil)
  = l RF. Provided that all types of RF produce the same impact on the climate
  system (in this case measured by mean temperature), the climate sensitivity
  parameter derived from a doubled-CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font> calculation can
  be used to translate other RFs, say from ozone or contrails, into a change in
  global mean surface air temperature. </p>
<p>For doubled CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font> relative to pre-industrial conditions
  (+4 W m<font size="-1">-2</font>), surface temperature warming ranges from 1.5
  to 4.5 K, depending on the modeling of feedback processes included in the CGCM.
  The recommended value in IPCC (1996) of 2.5 K gives a climate sensitivity of
  l = 0.6 K/(W m<font size="-1">-2</font>). With limited feedbacks (e.g., fixing
  clouds and surface ocean temperatures), the sensitivity parameter is smaller,
  and most models produce similar responses. In contrast, when all feedbacks are
  included, model results are quite different, as a result (for instance) of alternative
  formulation of clouds. The obvious limitation of this approach is that we get
  no information about regional climate change. The sensitivity parameter for
  aircraft-like ozone perturbations is discussed in <a href="081.htm">Section
  6.5</a>. </p>
<p>In spite of all these caveats, the radiative forcing of an aviation-induced
  atmospheric perturbation is still a useful index that allows, to first approximation,
  the different atmospheric perturbations (e.g., aerosols, cloud changes, ozone,
  stratospheric water, methane) to be summed and compared in terms of global climate
  impact. </p>
