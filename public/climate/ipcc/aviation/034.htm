<H2><b>3.2. Aerosol Emission and Formation in Aircraft Plumes</b></H2>
<p>Aircraft jet engines directly emit aerosol particles and condensable gases
  such as water vapor (H<span class="subscript">2</span>O), sulfuric acid (H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>), and organic compounds, which
  lead to the formation of new, liquid (volatile) particles in the early plume
  by gas-to-particle conversion (nucleation) processes. Other gas-phase species
  and charged molecular clusters (chemi-ions, or CIs) are also generated at emission,
  including nitric acid (HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>) and nitrous acid (HNO<span class="subscript">2</span>). Emission and formation
  of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> depend on fuel sulfur content, or sulfur emission index [EI(S)], and
  the conversion fraction of fuel sulfur to H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>. Formation of HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> and HNO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  depends on reactions of nitrogen oxides (NO<span class="subscript">x</span> = NO + NO<span class="subscript">2</span>) with hydroxyl radicals
  (OH). Particle formation depends on mixing of exhaust gases with ambient air,
  plume cooling rate, plume chemistry, and ambient aerosol properties. Soot particles
  formed during fuel combustion and emitted metallic particles constitute the
  solid (nonvolatile) particle fraction present in exhaust plumes. Under certain
  thermodynamic conditions, emitted water vapor condenses and freezes to form
  water-ice particles, thereby producing a condensation trail (contrail). These
  line clouds evaporate rapidly if the ambient humidity is low but may change
  the size and chemical composition of the remaining liquid aerosol particles.
  If the humidity is above ice saturation, contrails persist and grow through
  further deposition of ambient water. </p>
<p>An invisible aerosol trail is always left behind cruising aircraft. Aerosol
  and contrail formation processes in an aging plume determine the number, surface
  area, and mass of particles that are formed per mass of fuel consumed. Exhaust
  particle properties change in the presence of a contrail. Exhaust particle morphology
  and surface properties and aircraft-induced perturbations of background aerosol
  surface areas (<a href="036.htm">Section 3.3</a>) are of central importance
  for ozone changes caused by heterogeneous chemical reactions (Chapters <a href="020.htm">2</a>
  and <a href="044.htm">4</a>). Particle number and freezing probability are
  key for the formation of ice (cirrus) clouds after passage of an aircraft in
  a region where otherwise no clouds would form (<a href="038.htm">Section 3.4</a>).
  Finally, aviation-produced aerosol can directly or indirectly influence the
  radiation budget of the atmosphere (<a href="040.htm">Section 3.6</a> and <a href="063.htm">Chapter
  6</a>). For recent reviews see Schumann (1996a), Fabian and K�rcher (1997),
  Friedl (1997), and Brasseur et al. (1998). </p>
<p>The following subsections provide a description of volatile aerosol precursors
  and the formation of volatile aerosol particles, a characterization of emitted
  soot and metal particles, a review of contrail and ice formation, and a discussion
  of the mutual interactions between these particle types. Comments on reducing
  the impact of aerosols are given in <a href="041.htm#374">Section 3.7.4</a>.
</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="321"></a>3.2.1. Volatile Aerosol Precursors</i></b></h3>
<h4><i><a name="3211"></a>3.2.1.1. Water Vapor</i></h4>
<p>Water vapor is present in aircraft exhaust in known amounts because the emission
  index is specified by the stoichiometry of near-complete fuel combustion (<a href="088.htm">Chapter
  7</a>). Water vapor concentrations of a few percent at the engine exhaust nozzle
  far exceed the concentrations of other aerosol precursor gases. Ambient water
  vapor also participates in aerosol processes, with concentrations that vary
  widely depending on flight altitude and meteorological processes. Because of
  its abundance and thermodynamic properties, water vapor participates in nearly
  all aerosol formation and nucleation processes (e.g., Pruppacher and Klett,
  1997). </p>
<h4><i><a name="3212"></a>3.2.1.2. Sulfur Species </i></h4>
<p>Aviation fuels (kerosene) contain sulfur in trace amounts. In the current world
  market, the sulfur content-hence the EI(S)-of aviation fuels is near 0.4 g S/kg
  fuel or 400 parts per million by mass (ppm; 1 ppm = 0.0001%), with an upper
  limit specification of 3 g S/kg (<a href="088.htm">Chapter 7</a>). Of importance
  for the formation of plume aerosol is the partitioning of sulfur at the engine
  exhaust nozzle into sulfur dioxide (SO<span class="subscript">2</span>) and fully oxidized sulfur S(VI) compounds,
  sulfur trioxide and sulfuric acid (S(VI) = SO<span class="subscript">3</span> + H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>). Most fuel sulfur is
  expected to be emitted as SO<span class="subscript">2</span> based on combustion kinetics and some observations
  (Miake-Lye et al., 1993, 1998; Arnold et al., 1994; Schumann et al., 1998).
  However, a fraction of the SO<span class="subscript">2</span> can be converted into S(VI) by gas phase chemical
  reactions with OH, oxygen atoms (O), and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O inside the engine. The fractional
  conversion depends on details of combustion conditions, turbine flow properties,
  blade cooling effects (<a href="088.htm">Chapter 7</a>), and mixing (<a href="020.htm">Chapter
  2</a>). Further oxidation can occur in the plume, where the rate-limiting step
  is thought to be oxidation of SO<span class="subscript">2</span> by OH to form SO<span class="subscript">3</span> (Stockwell and Calvert,
  1983) or liquid-phase reactions of SO<span class="subscript">2</span> with H<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">2</span>, O<span class="subscript">3</span>, metals (Jacob and Hofmann,
  1983), or HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> (Fairbrother et al., 1997). Once SO<span class="subscript">3</span> is formed, the gas-phase
  reaction with emitted H<span class="subscript">2</span>O to form H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> is fast (< 0.1 s) under plume conditions
  (Reiner and Arnold, 1993; Kolb et al., 1994; Lovejoy et al., 1996). Gaseous
  H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> and HSO4-(H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>)n (mostly with n = 1,2) ion clusters have been observed
  in jet exhaust (Frenzel and Arnold, 1994; Arnold et al., 1998a,b). </p>

<p>The chemical lifetime of exhaust OH in the early jet regime is determined by
  reactions with emitted NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and by OH self-reactions, the latter leading to the
  formation of hydrogen peroxide (H<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">2</span>) (K�rcher et al., 1996a; Hanisco et al.,
  1997). Measurements indicate OH exit concentrations below 1 ppmv (Tremmel et
  al., 1998). For an OH concentration of 0.5 to 1 ppmv at the engine's nozzle
  exit plane and without SO<span class="subscript">3</span> emissions, the OH-induced pathway alone yields about
  0.3 to 1% S-to-H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> conversion in the plume (Miake-Lye et al., 1993; Danilin
  et al., 1994; K�rcher et al., 1996a). Model calculations indicate overall S(VI)
  conversion fractions in the range of 2 to 10% for various supersonic and subsonic
  jet engines (Brown et al., 1996a; Lukachko et al., 1998; <a href="088.htm">Chapter
  7</a>), consistent with some earlier SO<span class="subscript">3</span> measurements behind gas turbines (e.g.,
  CIAP, 1975; Hunter, 1982). </p>
<h4><i><a name="3213"></a>3.2.1.3. Chemi-ions </i></h4>
<p>A large number of chemi-ions (CIs) are expected to be present in aircraft exhaust
  because ion production via high-temperature chemical reactions is known to occur
  in the combustion of carbon-containing (not necessarily sulfur-containing) fuels
  (e.g., Burtscher, 1992). In the jet regime, some recent models indicate that
  CIs effectively promote formation and growth of electrically charged droplets
  containing H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O (Yu and Turco, 1997). In addition, CIs may contribute
  to the activation of exhaust soot. Positive ions include H3O+ and organic molecules
  like CHO+, C3H3+, and larger molecules (Calcote, 1983), whereas the free electrons
  rapidly attach to other molecules to form negative ions with sulfate and nitrate
  cores. Measurements of positive CIs in exhaust plumes are not available, and
  only very few in situ measurements of negative CIs are available to date. </p>
<p>Arnold et al. (1998a) measured a total negative CI concentration of 3 x 10<sup>7</sup>cm<sup>-3</sup> (about 3 x 1015/kg fuel) at plume ages of around 10 ms in the exhaust of
  a jet engine on the ground, consistent with approximately 10<sup>9</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> at a plume
  age of 1 ms (Yu et al., 1998). </p>
<p>That concentration represents a lower bound from diffusion losses of these
  particles within sampling devices prior to detection and the limited detection
  range of the employed mass spectrometer. The fact that these measurements yielded
  only a fraction of CIs in the plume has been partially confirmed by in-flight
  measurements (Arnold et al., 1998b) showing smaller total CI count rates for
  high-sulfur fuel compared with low-sulfur fuel. Therefore, current CI data are
  consistent with a CI emission index of about 2-4 x 1017/kg, corresponding to
  a concentration of about 2 x 10<sup>9</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> at the engine exit. This value has been
  estimated numerically based on coupled ion-ion recombination kinetics and plume
  mixing (Yu and Turco, 1997; K�rcher et al., 1998b; Yu et al.,1998). Although
  not directly comparable, CIs have been observed in hydrocarbon flames at concentrations
  of about 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>11</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> (Keil et al., 1984), supporting the estimated concentration
  of negative CIs. </p>
<h4><i><a name="3214"></a>3.2.1.4 Nitrogen Species </i></h4>
<p>The primary nitrogen emission from aircraft is in the form of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> (<a href="020.htm">Chapter
  2</a>). In reactions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> with OH in the plume, gaseous HNO<span class="subscript">2</span> and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> are
  formed. Despite larger reaction rates, less HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> is formed than HNO<span class="subscript">2</span> because
  the ratio of NO<span class="subscript">2</span> to NO at the engine exit is small (< 0.2) (e.g., Schulte et
  al., 1997) (see <a href="088.htm">Chapter 7</a>). HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> can also form in the
  plume even in the absence of NO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions (K�rcher et al., 1996a). In situ
  measurements in young plumes revealed both HNO<span class="subscript">2</span> and HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> concentrations above
  background levels (Arnold et al., 1992, 1994; Tremmel et al., 1998). HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> can
  be more abundant in plumes than H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>, especially for low EI(S) values. These
  acids (especially HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>) are important because they can be taken up by water-soluble
  exhaust particles and form stable condensed phases such as nitric acid trihydrate
  (NAT = HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>�3H<span class="subscript">2</span>O) and liquid ternary (H<span class="subscript">2</span>O/H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>/HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>) solutions under cold and
  humid plume conditions (Arnold et al., 1992; K�rcher, 1996). </p>
<h4><i><a name="3215"></a>3.2.1.5. Hydrocarbons </i></h4>
<p>Aircraft engines emit non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) as a result of incomplete
  fuel combustion. These species include alkenes (mostly ethene), aldehydes (mostly
  formaldehyde), alkines (mostly ethine), and a few aromates. A few (8 to 10)
  species were found to account for up to 80% of NMHC emissions (Spicer et al.,
  1992, 1994). High levels of carbonyl compound emissions (on the order of 0.2
  ppmv) also have been observed in a combustor (Wahl et al., 1997). Some in-flight
  data indicate that NMHCs with up to 8 carbon atoms have EIs in the range 0.05
  to 0.2 g C/kg fuel and represent approximately 70% of total NMHC emissions (Slemr
  et al., 1998). However, the current database on NMHC emissions and on partitioning
  between individual compounds is small and perhaps not representative for all
  engine types. Some emitted NMHCs might act as aerosol-forming agents in nascent
  plumes and may be adsorbed or dissolved in plume particles, thereby possibly
  contributing to the total amount of volatile aerosol found in plumes (K�rcher
  et al., 1998b). In addition, the presence of trace NMHCs amounts may facilitate
  nucleation (e.g., Katz et al., 1977) and alter the hygroscopic behavior and
  growth rates of particles (Saxena et al., 1995; Cruz and Pandis, 1997). Engines
  also may emit volatile particles containing engine oils or other lubricants,
  but this effect has not been quantified. </p>
<p>Aircraft also occasionally introduce hydrocarbons by jettisoning fuel at low
  altitudes in the troposphere. Most of the fuel evaporates while it falls to
  the ground (Quackenbush et al., 1994), which leads to a small increase of hydrocarbons
  in this region. Because of the small amounts of fuel released in this way, no
  essential impacts on atmospheric aerosols are expected. </p>
<h3><b><a name="322"></a>3.2.2. Volatile Particles </b></h3>
<h4><i><a name="3221"></a>3.2.2.1. Basic Processes </i></h4>
<p>Volatile particles form in the exhaust plume of an aircraft as a result of 
  nucleation processes associated with the emission of aerosol precursors (Hofmann 
  and Rosen, 1978). Typical aerosol parameters in a young plume are included in 
  <a href="034.htm#tab31">Table 3-1</a> for reference. The newly formed particles 
  grow by condensation (uptake of gaseous species) and coagulation (particles 
  collide and attach) in the expanding plume. Coagulation processes involving 
  charged particles originating from CI emissions are more effective because charge 
  forces enhance collision rates. These processes are schematically presented 
  in <a href="034.htm#img31">Figure 3-1</a>. Key processes at young plume ages 
  are determined mainly from the results of simulation models because of the lack 
  of suitable plume measurements. </p>
<p>Previous models (Miake-Lye et al., 1994; K�rcher et al., 1995; Zhao and Turco,
  1995; Brown et al., 1996b; Taleb et al., 1997; Gleitsmann and Zellner, 1998a,b)
  show that particles form when the condensing species, primarily H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>/H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, reach
  concentrations critical for binary homogeneous nucleation in the expanding and
  cooling exhaust gas. Because concentrations fall below nucleation thresholds
  as the plume further dilutes, the amount of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> in the early stages of the
  plume (< 1 s) controls the formation of new volatile particles. More recent
  models emphasize the role of CI emissions in volatile particle formation and
  growth (Yu and Turco, 1997, 1998a,b; K�rcher, 1998a; K�rcher et al., 1998a).
  <a href="034.htm#img32">Figure 3-2</a> shows the size distributions of exhaust
  particles at a plume age of 1 s, as inferred from models and a few measurements.
  In the radius range below 10 nm, volatile particles containing H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O
  dominate the overall distribution. Model analyses of near-field particle measurements
  strongly suggest that the volatile particle size distribution exhibits a bimodal
  structure (Yu and Turco, 1997), with smaller particles formed by the aggregation
  of homogeneously nucleated clusters of hydrated H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> molecules (neutral mode)
  and larger particles formed by rapid scavenging of charged molecular clusters
  by CIs (ion-mode). Only particles from the ion mode are expected to grow beyond
  the smallest detectable sizes (radius ~2 to 3 nm) of particle counters. Soot
  and ice contrail particles are significantly larger than the volatiles. An approximate
  stratospheric size distribution is shown for comparison. In contrast to soot
  and ice particles (see below), volatile particle spectra are mainly derived
  from numerical simulation models because of the lack of size-resolved, in situ
  particle measurements in the nanometer size range. However, the use (in field
  measurements) of multiple particle counters with different lower size-detection
  limits allows derivation of the mean sizes of observable particles as a function
  of fuel sulfur content and plume age (K�rcher et al., 1998b; Yu et al., 1998),
  thereby providing strong criteria to test the validity of model results. </p>

<p>Once formed, the new volatile particles interact with nonvolatile and contrail 
  ice particles through the processes of coagulation, freezing, condensation, 
  and evaporation (<a href="034.htm#img31"img31">Figure 3-1</a>). Calculations 
  show that the new liquid particles grow and shrink as a function of relative 
  humidity, whereas H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> 
  molecules that enter the droplets stay in the liquid phase because of their 
  very low saturation vapor pressure (Mirabel and Katz, 1974). They also suggest 
  that volatile particles may take up HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> and 
  H<span class="subscript">2</span>O in the near field (K�rcher, 1996) to form 
  particles with compositions similar to those found in cold regions of the stratosphere. 
  These particles may persist in cold (< 200 K), HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>-rich 
  stratospheric air but will be short-lived (< 1 min) otherwise. As the plume 
  continues to dilute with ambient air, abundant newly formed volatile particles 
  remain at nanometer sizes and therefore add substantially to the overall aerosol 
  surface area and abundance (Danilin et al., 1997). Their efficiency for heterogeneous 
  chemistry and cloud formation, however, is size- and composition-dependent (K�rcher, 
  1997). They may be too small to act as efficient cloud- or ice-forming nuclei 
  in the background atmosphere unless the air mass containing the aerosol is lifted 
  or cooled or the relative humidity increases. Although studies exist on heterogeneous 
  plume processing along selected trajectories (Danilin et al., 1994), systematic 
  investigations of heterogeneous chemistry coupled to plume aerosol dynamics 
  remain to be performed (<a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>). </p>

<p>The evolution of volatile particles is significantly altered if a contrail 
  forms. In contrails, volatile particles have to grow to sizes greater than about 
  100 nm via uptake of ambient H<span class="subscript">2</span>O before most 
  of them freeze (<a href="035.htm#3242">Section 3.2.4.2</a>). As ice particles 
  grow in size by deposition of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O, they may also 
  scavenge other volatile and soot particles (Anderson et al., 1998a,b; Schr�der 
  et al., 1998a). Thus, contrails are expected to contain fewer small particles 
  than non-contrail plumes because of enhanced scavenging losses. After evaporation 
  of contrail ice crystals, the residual volatile and soot cores remain as particles 
  in the atmosphere (<a href="034.htm#img31"img31">Figure 3-1</a>). This contrail 
  processing is expected to modify the particle size distribution and composition 
  and may lead to efficient cloud condensation nuclei production (Yu and Turco, 
  1998b). </p>
<h4><i><a name="3222"></a>3.2.2.2. Observations and Modeling of Volatile Particles
  and Sulfur Conversion </i></h4>
<p>Volatile particle abundances observed in situ in the plumes (mostly young,
  < 100 s) of subsonic and supersonic aircraft are summarized in <a href="034.htm#img33">Figure
  3-3a</a>. The data have been compiled from various field studies (Fahey et al.,
  1995a,b; Schumann et al., 1997; Anderson et al., 1998a,b; Schr�der et al., 1998a).
  The results show EIs for ultrafine volatile aerosol particles (nominal radii
  > 2 to 3 nm) in the range of 1015 to 1016/kg fuel for low to average fuel sulfur
  content values and exceeding 1017/kg fuel for high-sulfur fuel. Besides the
  obvious dependence on fuel sulfur content, the spread in EI values may be explained
  by differences in the emission characteristics of the engines, variations in
  the lower size detection limits of the particle counters, and differences in
  plume ages at the time of the observations. The increase in ultrafine particle
  abundance with increasing fuel sulfur content for the Advanced Technology Testing
  Aircraft System (ATTAS), T-38, and B757 aircraft strongly suggests an important
  role for fuel sulfur in the growth of volatiles from molecular clusters to detectable
  particles. </p>
<p>Only a few observations have been analyzed using detailed microphysical simulation
  models (Brown et al., 1996a; Danilin et al., 1997; K�rcher and Fahey, 1997;
  Yu and Turco, 1997, 1998a; Andronache and Chameides, 1998; K�rcher et al., 1998a,b).
  Simulations show better agreement between calculated and observed particle concentrations
  when ion effects are taken into account. More important, the description of
  plume microphysics using binary homogeneous nucleation failed to explain a field
  measurement (Yu et al., 1998). In two cases, condensation nucleus observations
  in the exhaust of the ATTAS and the Concorde (<a href="034.htm#img33">Figure 3-3a</a>)
  have been explained in detail with a model that includes CI emissions on the
  order of 1017/kg fuel. The observable (ion mode) particles have mean radii of
  about 2 to 4 nm in the young plume, for EI(S) ranging from average to high values.
  For decreasing levels of available H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>, the ion mode particles decrease in
  size. The number of detected particles falls below 1017/kg fuel when the mean
  radius of their size distribution becomes smaller than the detection limit of
  the particle counters.</p>

<p>The extent of conversion of fuel sulfur to S(VI) necessary to explain the observed
  mass of volatile aerosol in young plumes seems to be variable. Direct measurements
  of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> have provided a lower bound of ~0.4% (for high-sulfur fuel, 2.7 g/kg
  fuel) and an upper bound of ~2.5% (for low-sulfur fuel, 0.02 g/kg fuel) for
  the conversion fraction in one case (Curtius et al., 1998), consistent with
  calculated SO<span class="subscript">3</span> emission levels (Brown et al., 1996a,c). For the low fuel-sulfur
  case, it has been demonstrated that the observed volatile particles cannot be
  mainly composed of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> (K�rcher et al., 1998b). In other cases, conversion
  fractions have been indirectly inferred from mass balance arguments involving
  observed or inferred particle size and number distributions, available sulfur
  as measured in fuel samples, and assumptions of aerosol composition. The dependence
  of the conversion fraction on EI(S) differs in the few studies performed to
  date (Fahey et al., 1995a; Schumann et al., 1996; Hagen et al., 1998; Miake-Lye
  et al., 1998; Pueschel et al., 1998). The values deduced from these measurements
  range from the minimum value of 0.4% to more than 20%. Some of the indirect
  analyses may be affected by uncertainties (possibly about 20%) regarding the
  sulfur content in the fuels. Other experimental uncertainties are associated
  with these determinations, and the range of aircraft engines and operating parameters
  adds to the observed variability. </p>

<p>Generalization of these results cannot be done with confidence because of limited 
  empirical knowledge of the S(VI) conversion fraction and emission levels of 
  CIs representative of the exhaust as it enters the atmosphere. Part of the observed 
  volatile aerosol may be composed of HNO<span class="subscript">2</span> (Zhang 
  et al., 1996; K�rcher, 1997) or NMHCs (K�rcher et al., 1998b), or it may result 
  from unrecognized sulfur oxidation reactions (Danilin et al., 1997; Miake-Lye 
  et al., 1998). Uptake of gaseous SO<span class="subscript">2</span> and subsequent 
  heterogeneous oxidation to sulfate in the new volatile particles is likely small 
  (K�rcher, 1997), but the possibility of other condensational or aqueous-phase 
  growth mechanisms has not yet been fully explored. On the other hand, CI emissions 
  of about 1017/kg fuel are consistent with observations (see <a href="034.htm#3213">Section 
  3.2.1.3</a>), although they need to be confirmed by further measurements at 
  the engine exit. The best estimate for the S-to-H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> 
  conversion fraction in young plumes is 5%, with an estimated variability, or 
  uncertainty range, of 1 to 20%. Combustion models predict a range of sulfur 
  conversion up to about 10% and a potential for slightly higher values because 
  of turbine blade cooling effects (<a href="034.htm#3212">Sections 3.2.1.2</a> 
  and <a href="104.htm">7.6</a>). Low conversion fractions of 2% are sufficient 
  to explain observed volatile particle concentrations in the young plume behind 
  the ATTAS when the effects of CIs are taken into account in simulation models 
  of plume chemistry and microphysics (K�rcher et al., 1998a,b; Yu and Turco, 
  1998a,b; Yu et al., 1998). In contrast, the Concorde observations can be explained 
  by assuming that about 20% of the fuel sulfur is converted to SO<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  before leaving the engine exit in such simulations (Yu and Turco, 1997). </p>
<p><i>In situ</i> measurements detailing particle volatility and size distributions
  such as those included in <a href="034.htm#img33">Figure 3-3</a> have involved
  relatively young plumes. Further observations in aging plumes (> 1 h) as they
  dilute with the background atmosphere are currently lacking. Without detailed
  observations of the microphysical evolution and chemical composition of volatile
  exhaust particles from the engine exhaust plume to the global scale, important
  uncertainties remain in assessing the potential global impact of exhaust products
  on chemistry and cloudiness. </p>
