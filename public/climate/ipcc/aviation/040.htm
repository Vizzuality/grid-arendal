<h2><b>3.6. Radiative Properties of Aerosols, Contrails, and Cirrus Clouds</b></h2>
<p> Aircraft emissions have an impact on the Earth's radiation budget and climate
  through direct and indirect changes in aerosols and cloudiness. Recent climate
  assessments have stressed the importance of natural and anthropogenic changes
  in aerosols on direct radiative forcing (Charlson et al., 1990; Schwartz, 1996).
  Aerosols and contrails have direct effects (scattering and absorbing solar and
  longwave radiation) and indirect effects (modifying the formation of cloud particles
  and radiative properties of clouds). Several studies have addressed the direct
  impact of contrails (e.g., Detwiler and Pratt, 1984; Grassl, 1990; Liou et al.,
  1990; Sassen, 1997). The indirect effect of contrails has not yet been investigated
  in detail. The direct radiative impacts of aircraft soot emissions (Pueschel
  et al., 1992, 1997) and sulfate aerosol have been evaluated as being small (Friedl,
  1997; Brasseur et al., 1998). The indirect radiative effect of aircraft-induced
  aerosols on clouds is essentially unknown. In fact, the indirect radiative effect
  of non-aviation aerosol has been studied for liquid water clouds (IPCC, 1996),
  but the indirect effect of changing cirrus is not yet known either. Here, the
  discussion focuses on the impact of aircraft-generated aerosol and that of contrails
  and changed cirrus clouds.</p>

<p>Radiative forcing is defined as the net radiative flux change at some level
  in the atmosphere calculated in response to a perturbation, such as a change
  in cloud cover. The definition of radiative forcing used here is the "instantaneous"
  or "static" flux change at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) (IPCC, 1996) (see
  <a href="063.htm">Chapter 6</a>). A positive net flux change represents an
  energy gain, hence a net heating of the Earth system. </p>
<h3><i><b><a name="361"></a>3.6.1. Direct Radiative Impact of Aerosols </b></i></h3>
<p>The direct radiative impact of aircraft-induced aerosol is much smaller than
  that of volcanic stratospheric or regional tropospheric aerosol and smaller
  than other aircraft-induced radiative forcing values (see <a href="063.htm">Chapter
  6</a>). Radiative forcing by aerosol depends on many parameters (Haywood and
  Ramaswamy, 1998). For aerosol in the size range 0.1 to 1 µm, the increase in
  solar reflectance (albedo effect) exceeds the trapping of terrestrial radiation
  (greenhouse effect), causing a surface cooling (Lacis et al., 1992, Minnis et
  al., 1993; Minnis et al., 1998c). Aircraft-induced aerosols could have an importance
  similar to that of natural stratospheric aerosol variations if their optical
  depth in the solar range were of comparable magnitude to that of natural stratospheric
  aerosol. The optical depth of aerosol is proportional to its column load. The
  maximum zonally averaged column load from soot emissions and aircraft-induced
  sulfuric acid is estimated (see <a href="036.htm">Section 3.3</a>) to be less
  than 1 and 6 ng cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. Small sulfuric acid particles are nonabsorbent
  but scatter strongly in the shortwave spectrum, with mass scattering efficiencies
  of 7 (4-10) m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> in the solar range depending on relative humidity (Boucher
  and Anderson, 1995; Lacis and Mishchenko, 1995). Soot is a strong absorber of
  solar energy, with mass extinction coefficients of about 10 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> (Pueschel
  et al., 1992; Penner, 1995; Petzold and Schröder, 1998). As a consequence of
  the product of given column load and extinction efficiency, the maximum change
  in zonal-mean optical depth from aircraft soot and sulfate aerosol is less than
  4 x 10<sup>-3</sup>. For comparison, the solar optical depth of stratospheric aerosol varies
  typically between 0.005 and 0.15, depending on volcanic aerosol loading (Sato
  et al., 1993). Regionally, within the main flight corridors, a particle concentration
  change of approximately 30 cm<sup>-3</sup> at 0.1-µm mean diameter over a vertical layer
  of 2 km cannot be ruled out (Schumann et al., 1996; Friedl, 1997; Schlager et
  al., 1997), implying a mass load on the order of 10 ng cm<sup>-2</sup> and a solar optical
  depth of about 0.001. This regional change is small compared with other regional
  variations. Tropospheric aerosol layers with optical depth of 0.1 to 0.5 occur
  frequently off the coasts of North America and Europe (Russell et al., 1997).
</p>
<h3><i><b><a name="362"></a>3.6.2. Radiative Properties of Cirrus Clouds </b></i></h3>
<p>Contrails are ice clouds with radiative effects similar to thin cirrus cloud
  layers (Liou, 1986; Raschke et al., 1998). At the TOA, thin layers of cirrus
  clouds or contrails tend to enhance radiative forcing and hence the greenhouse
  effect because they cause only a small reduction of the downward solar flux
  but have relatively larger impact on the upward terrestrial radiative flux.
  An increase in cloud cover by thin cirrus clouds may therefore cause an increase
  in the net energy gain of the planet (Stephens and Webster, 1981; Fu and Liou,
  1993). Contrails and cirrus clouds also have an impact on the radiative energy
  budget at the Earth's surface. Although radiative forcing at the TOA is most
  important for long-term and global climate changes, forcing at the surface may
  have short-term regional consequences. </p>

      1999).</i></p>
    </td>

</table>
<p>Longwave (LW) radiative forcing by cirrus or contrails is greatest when clear-sky
  radiative flux to space is large (i.e., larger over warm than over cool surfaces,
  larger in a dry than in a humid atmosphere) and cloud emissivity is large (Ebert
  and Curry, 1992; Fu and Liou, 1993). For thin clouds, emissivity increases with
  ice water path, which is the product of the ice water content (IWC) of the cloud
  and its geometrical depth. The emissivity of ice particles in a cirrus layer
  is much larger, in particular at 8 to 12 µm (King et al., 1992; Minnis et al.,
  1998c), than that of the same amount of water in gaseous form. Hence, absorption
  and emission from an atmospheric layer increase when ice particles form at the
  expense of ambient water vapor (Detwiler, 1983; Meerkötter et al.,1999). </p>
<p>Shortwave (SW) radiative forcing of cirrus clouds is determined mainly by solar
  zenith angle, surface albedo, and cloud optical depth (which increases with
  ice water path) (Ebert and Curry, 1992; Platt, 1997). For fixed ice water path,
  clouds containing smaller particles have larger optical depth and exhibit larger
  solar albedo (Twomey, 1977; Betancor-Gothe and Grassl, 1993). Aspherical particles
  cause a larger albedo than spherical ones (Kinne and Liou, 1989; Gayet et al.,
  1998). SW forcing is negative when the cloud causes an increase of system albedo.
  In general, SW forcing has a greater magnitude over dark surfaces than over
  bright surfaces. </p>
<p>The net radiative forcing of clouds is the sum of SW and LW flux changes and
  may be positive or negative. Thin cirrus clouds cause a small but positive radiative
  forcing at the TOA; thick cirrus clouds may cause cooling (Stephens and Webster,
  1981; Fu and Liou, 1993). In the global mean, an increase in cirrus cloud cover
  warms the Earth's surface (Hansen et al., 1997). Maximum heating is reached
  at intermediate ice water path, corresponding to an optical depth of about 2
  to 3, and the effect shifts to small cooling for optical depths greater than
  about 10 to 20 (Platt, 1981; Jensen et al., 1994a). Net forcing also varies
  with particle size but less than its two spectral components. For thin cirrus,
  smaller particles (but > 3-mm radius) tend to cause stronger heating by increasing
  cloud albedo less strongly than emissivity (Fu and Liou, 1993). </p>
<h3><i><b><a name="363"></a>3.6.3. Radiative Properties of Contrail Clouds </b></i></h3>
<p>Contrails are radiatively important only if formed in ice-supersaturated air,
  where they may persist and spread to several-kilometer lateral widths and a
  few hundred meters vertical depth (Detwiler and Pratt, 1984; Jäger et al., 1998)
  (see also <a href="038.htm#344">Section 3.4.4</a>). In contrast, shorter lived
  contrails have much smaller spatial and temporal scales, hence contribute much
  less to the radiation budget (Ponater et al., 1996). The impact of contrails
  on transmission of radiation depends on their optical depth. In the solar range
  (near a wavelength of 0.55 µm), the optical depth of observed persistent contrails
  varies typically between 0.1 and 0.5 (Kästner et al., 1993; Sassen, 1997; Jäger
  et al., 1998; Minnis et al., 1998a). Occasionally, very thick contrails (on
  the order of 700 m) with optical depths greater than 1.0 are found at higher
  temperatures (up to -30°C) (Schumann and Wendling, 1990; Gayet et al., 1996).
  The optical depth in the 10-µm range is about half that near 0.55 µm (Duda and
  Spinhirne, 1996). Particles in young persistent contrails are typically smaller
  (mean diameter 10 to 30 µm) than in other cirrus cloud types (greater than 30
  µm) (Brogniez et al., 1995; Gayet et al., 1996) but grow as the contrail ages
  and may approach the size of natural cirrus particles within a time scale on
  the order of 1 h (see <a href="038.htm">Section 3.4</a>) (Minnis et al., 1998a).
  The number density of ice crystals in contrails (on the order of 10 to 200 cm<sup>-3</sup>)
  is much larger than in cirrus clouds (Sassen, 1997; Schröder et al., 1998b).
  Reported IWC values in aged contrails vary between 0.7 and 18 mg m<sup>-3</sup> (Gayet
  et al., 1996; Schröder et al., 1998b), consistent with results from numerical
  studies (Gierens, 1996). As for cirrus clouds (Heymsfield, 1993; Heymsfield
  et al., 1998b), the IWC of contrails is expected to depend on ambient temperature
  (Meerkötter et al., 1999) because the amount of water mass available between
  liquid and ice saturation (for temperatures < -12°C) increases with temperature
  (Ludlam, 1980). Hence, contrails may be optically thicker at lower altitudes
  and higher temperatures. Contrail particles have been found to contain soot
  (see <a href="035.htm">Section 3.2.3</a>). Soot in or on ice particles may increase
  absorption of solar radiation by the ice particles, hence reduce the albedo
  of the contrails. The importance of soot depends on the type of internal or
  external mixing and the volume fraction of soot enclosures. Because soot particles
  are typically less than 1 mm in diameter, their impact on the optical properties
  of ice particles in aged contrails is likely to be small. Contrail particles
  often deviate from a spherical shape (see <a href="038.htm#344">Section 3.4.4</a>).
  The magnitude and possibly even the sign of the mean net radiative forcing of
  contrails depends on the diurnal cycle of contrail cover. For the same contrail
  cover, the net radiative forcing is larger at night. Satellite data reveal a
  day/night contrail cover ratio of about 2 to 3 (Bakan et al., 1994; Mannstein,
  1997). Aviation fuel consumption inventories suggest a longitude-dependent noon/midnight
  contrail cover ratio of 2.8 as a global mean value (Schmitt and Brunner, 1997).

<h3><i><b><a name="364"></a>3.6.4. Radiative Forcing of Line-Shaped Contrail Cirrus
  </b></i></h3>
<p>Model studies indicate the importance of contrails in changing the Earth's
  radiation budget. One-dimensional (1-D) models represent contrails as plane-parallel
  clouds in a homogeneously layered atmosphere and use area-weighted sums for
  fractional contrail cover (Fortuin et al., 1995; Strauss et al., 1997; Meerkötter
  et al., 1999). As a consequence, contrail forcing grows linearly with contrail
  cover in these models. Inhomogeneity effects may be large in natural cirrus
  (Kinne et al., 1997) and small for vertically thin contrail clouds (Schulz,
  1998) but may be important for thick and narrow contrails. Computations of radiative
  forcing by contrails have been done for fixed atmospheric temperatures in the
  North Atlantic flight corridor (Fortuin et al., 1995). Normalized to 100% contrail
  cover (as provided by 1-D models), these computations found a net forcing in
  the range of -30 to +60 W m<sup>-2</sup> in summer and 10 to 60 W m<sup>-2</sup> in winter. The negative
  forcing values apply to clouds that are much thicker than typical contrails.
  A radiative convective model used to simulate the climatic conditions of a mid-European
  region (Strauss et al., 1997) found a radiative flux change of almost 30 W m<sup>-2</sup>
  at the tropopause for 100% contrail cover with 0.55-µm optical depth of 0.28,
  and a surface temperature increase on the order of 0.05 K for a 0.5% increase
  in current contrail cloud cover. With a 2-D radiative convective model, a 1
  K increase was found in surface temperature over most of the Northern Hemisphere
  for an additional cirrus cover of 5% (Liou et al., 1990). The potential effects
  of contrails on global climate were simulated with a GCM that introduced additional
  cirrus cover with the same optical properties as natural cirrus in air traffic
  regions with large fuel consumption (Ponater et al., 1996). The induced temperature
  change was more than 1 K at the Earth's surface in Northern mid-latitudes for
  5% additional cirrus cloud cover in the main traffic regions. Meerkötter et
  al. (1998) applied three established radiation transfer models to compute the
  static radiative forcing due to a prescribed additional cloud cover by contrails.
  These models, which assume plane parallel cloud cover, are the two- and four-stream
  models of Fu and Liou (1993) (FL); the matrix operator method of Plass et al.
  (1973), also used by Strauss et al. (1997) (M); and the four-stream model of
  Nakajima and Tanaka (1986, 1988) (N). The FL and M models have participated
  in model comparison exercises (Ellingson and Fouquart, 1990). <a href="039.htm#tab36">Table
  3-6</a> on the previous page shows the results of a parameter study that was
  carried out for various regions and seasons using models M and FL for spherical
  and hexagonal particles. The contrails cause a net forcing that is positive

<p>LW flux changes. The magnitude of SW forcing is larger over dark ocean than
  over bright snow surfaces and larger for hexagonal ice particles than for spheres.
  LW forcing is larger in the tropics than in polar regions. Despite the small
  ocean albedo, net forcing is largest in the tropics because it has the warmest
  lower atmosphere. These results are consistent with the expectation that net
  forcing is smallest over cool and dark surfaces. Net forcing over the mid-latitude
  continent is larger in summer than in winter. Hexagonal particles cause a larger
  albedo than spherical ones, therefore less net forcing. These results show that
  contrail heating generally prevails over cooling in the atmosphere-surface system.
  However, this finding does not preclude situations in which contrails cause
  a net cooling-for example, very cold surface, high atmospheric humidity, low
  surface albedo, very small particles (< 10 µm; the limit depends on the ice
  water path in the cloud), or large optical contrail depth (> 10). TOA radiative
  forcing depends mainly on the cover and on parameters that determine the solar
  optical depth of contrails and to a minor degree on other parameters. Forcing
  is very weakly sensitive to the methods used for radiative transfer calculations.
  This sensitivity can be seen from <a href="040.htm#tab37">Table 3-7</a>, which
  lists the results of a parameter sensitivity study with models FL, M, and N
  (Meerkötter et al., 1999). Except for the first two rows of <a href="040.htm#tab37">Table
  3-7</a>, results are from model N only because the results of the three models
  agree with each other to within 3%. The largest model differences are found
  for aspherical particles, which are represented by different shapes in various
  spectral regions in the models, but all models show smaller net forcing for
  aspherical particles than for spherical ones, as expected (Kinne and Liou, 1989).
  The results also depend rather strongly on solar zenith angle, ice water content,
  particle diameter, surface albedo, and relative humidity. Low-level clouds with
  large cover and optical depth reduce SW and LW forcing of the cloud-free case
  below a contrail, causing a small net increase of forcing. Variations in surface
  temperature (here ± 5 K) cause small LW flux changes. Lowering the altitude
  of a contrail for fixed IWC reduces the LW effect slightly. Lowering the altitude
  of the contrail and using the IWC that is expected for the higher temperature
  at lower levels makes the lower contrail optically thicker and radiatively more
  effective than the higher contrail. Hence, TOA radiative forcing by contrails
  grows with increasing surface temperature, surface albedo, and IWC. For the
  same IWC, contrails with small ice particles are more effective in radiative
  forcing than contrails with larger particles. Representative forcing values
  are approximately 25 to 40 W m<sup>-2</sup> for 100% contrail cover and 0.55-µm optical
  depth of 0.5. Radiative forcing by contrails depends strongly on the optical
  depth of the contrails and is different at the surface than at the TOA. <a href="040.htm#img320">Figure
  3-20</a> shows computed SW, LW, and net change in radiative fluxes at the TOA
  (actually 50 km) and at the surface for 100% contrail cloud cover for the mid-latitude
  summer continental reference case with spherical ice particles. The ice water
  content was varied to yield different values of the 0.55-µm optical depth t.
  The trends are consistent with those found in cirrus studies (Fu and Liou, 1993).
  At the TOA, LW forcing is larger than SW forcing, giving a net heating of the
  atmosphere that is maximum near t = 3. The flux increases slightly less than
  linearly with optical depth for small values of t. The net forcing changes sign
  and becomes negative for t > 10 (not shown), but contrails are probably never
  that optically thick. This analysis indicates that contrails heat the atmosphere
  below them. </p>

<p>In all cases, TOA and top of the troposphere radiative flux changes from contrails
  differ by only about 10%; therefore, the instantaneous or static flux change
  gives a reasonable approximation for the adjusted radiative forcing as considered
  in IPCC (1996). </p>
<p>At the Earth's surface, LW flux changes are much smaller because water vapor
  closes much of the infrared radiation window in the lower atmosphere. In contrast,
  SW flux changes are only a little smaller than at TOA. Hence, the daytime SW
  contribution dominates and cools the surface in the daily mean. A reduction
  of solar radiation by 40 W m<sup>-2</sup> has been measured locally in the shadow of contrails,
  although the simultaneous change in infrared flux in the shadow of contrails
  was very small (Sassen, 1997). Hence, the Earth's surface is locally cooled
  in the shadow of contrails. This analysis does not exclude warming of the entire
  atmosphere-surface system driven by the net flux change at TOA. As radiation-convection
  models show, for example, vertical heat exchange in the atmosphere may cause
  a warming of the surface even when it receives less energy by radiation (Strauss
  et al., 1997). Cooling of the atmosphere below contrails is also suggested by
  measurements of solar and infrared upward and downward fluxes above and below
  a few persistent contrails (Kuhn, 1970). These measurements show a strong (10-20%)
  reduction of net downward radiation just below approximately 500-m-thick contrails
  with little change in LW fluxes. Further investigation is required to demonstrate
  how these results depend on the geometry and age of contrails. </p>
<p>Contrail cirrus induce a heat source by the change in divergence of solar and
  infrared radiation fluxes mainly within but also below the contrail in the upper
  troposphere (Liou et al., 1990; Strauss et al., 1997; Meerkötter et al., 1999).
  In the atmosphere below a contrail, the change in heat source is on the order
  of 0.3 K/day for 100% cover. When the contrail is located above a thick lower
  level cloud, the atmosphere is heated only above the lower cloud; the heat source
  is essentially zero below the lower cloud. In the diurnal cycle, radiative forcing
  by contrails is positive and strongest during the night because of the absence
  of negative SW forcing (see <a href="039.htm#tab36">Table 3-6</a>). For small
  optical depth, net forcing at TOA is also positive during the day, hence always
  positive regardless of the diurnal cycle of contrail cover. Negative SW forcing
  is maximum not at noon but during morning or afternoon hours, when the solar
  zenith angle is near 70°. Other than at TOA, the net flux change is negative
  at the surface even for thin contrails during the day, in particular at intermediate
  zenith angles. The maximum day-night difference in net radiative forcing at
  the surface for cloudless summer mid-latitude conditions is about 20 W m<sup>-2</sup> for
  constant 100% contrail cover with optical depth of 1 and constant surface temperature,
  and slightly less when accounting for the daily temperature cycle. </p>

<p>The global distribution of radiative forcing from contrails can be estimated
  using a radiation transfer model, the expected contrail cover, and a realistic
  representation of the cloudy atmosphere and surface (Minnis et al., 1999). Global
  contrail cover for 1992, for example, is shown in <a href="038.htm#img316">Figure
  3-16</a> (see <a href="038.htm#343">Section 3.4.3</a>). Global mean values for
  TOA radiative flux are summarized in <a href="040.htm#tab38">Table 3-8</a>,
  along with details of the calculations. As expected, SW forcing is negative
  and LW and net forcings are positive. All three values increase less than linearly
  with solar optical depth t. The resulting 1992 global distribution of TOA net
  forcing for t of 0.3 is shown in <a href="040.htm#img321">Figure 3-21</a>. Forcing
  is largest in regions of heavy air traffic, with maximum values over northeast
  France (0.71 W m<sup>-2</sup>) and near New York (0.58 W m<sup>-2</sup>). Although the contrail amount
  is higher over the northeast United States of America, net contrail forcing
  over Europe is greater because of the greater LW forcing term. The global mean
  net forcing for t between 0.3 and 0.5 is about 0.02 W m<sup>-2</sup>; the zonal mean value
  is largest near 40°N, with a value five times larger than the global mean. </p>

<p>Computed results for global radiative forcing by contrails depend on assumed
  values for contrail cover and mean optical depth of contrails. Neither is well
  known. Here, the computed global contrail cover was normalized to yield 0.5%
  observed cover by line-shaped contrails over Europe, guided by satellite data.
  Because satellite data mainly reveal thicker contrails, a larger cover resulting
  from the presence of optically thin contrail cirrus might not be accurately
  detected. Therefore, the results for larger t values (0.3 to 0.5) are considered
  in combination with the given contrail cover (0.1% globally) as being most representative
  for real forcing conditions. Hence, in the diurnal and annual mean, a global
  0.1% increase in thin contrail cloud cover causes a net heating of the Earth-atmosphere
  system of approximately 0.02 W m<sup>-2</sup>. The difference between the largest and smallest
  net forcing values in <a href="040.htm#tab38">Table 3-8</a> suggests an error
  bound on the order of 0.01 W m<sup>-2</sup>. Based on <a href="039.htm">Section 3.5</a>,
  the actual global cover may (with 2/3 probability) be 2 to 3 times smaller or
  larger than the derived line-shaped contrail cover. The optical depth value
  is likely known to a factor of 2 to 3. Thus, for assumed Gaussian behavior of
  individual uncertainties, the radiative forcing value may differ from the best
  estimate by a factor of about 3 to 4. </p>

<p>Based on computations using estimates of line-shaped contrail occurrence for
  the 1992 fuel scenario (0.1% cover), the best estimate of global-mean radiative
  forcing is positive, has a value of about 0.02 W m<sup>-2</sup> with an uncertainty factor
  of 3 to 4, and may range from 0.005 to 0.06 W m<sup>-2</sup> for present climate conditions.
  Certainly, the state of our understanding is only fair. Future investigations
  may result in considerable changes to the best estimates. </p>
<p>Global radiative forcing by contrails obviously is much smaller than that attributed 
  to other anthropogenic changes in the past century-1.5 W m<sup>-2</sup>, which 
  represents about the median of the range of values given in IPCC (1996) but 
  comparable to the forcing by past CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions 
  by aircraft (Brasseur et al., 1998; see <a href="063.htm">Chapter 6</a>). A 
  mean radiative forcing of 0.02 W m<sup>-2</sup> induces a vertically averaged 
  heat source in the troposphere equivalent to approximately 0.0002 K day-1. The 
  atmosphere reacts to this heat source in a complex manner (Ponater et al., 1996) 
  and may take decades to reach a steady-state temperature response. In steady 
  state, the mean surface temperature may increase by about 0.01 to 0.02 K globally 
  if climate sensitivity from contrail forcing is comparable to that of well-mixed 
  greenhouse gases (IPCC, 1996; see <a href="070.htm#621">Section 6.2.1</a>). 
  In comparison to the global mean value, annually averaged zonal mean values 
  are larger by a factor of about 5, and regional values are larger by a factor 
  of up to 40 (see <a href="040.htm#img321">Figure 3-21</a>). The pattern of the 
  climate response differs from the pattern of radiative forcing, in particular 
  at small regional scales. Zonal mean steady-state temperature changes of between 
  0.01 and 0.1 K appear to be possible for present contrail cover when previous 
  studies as scaled to the cover and radiative forcing found here (Liou et al., 
  1990; Ponater et al., 1996; Strauss et al., 1997). Regional contrail forcing 
  may have short-term consequences for the daily temperature range in such a region 
  if contrail forcing persists for at least a day. These temperature changes appear 
  to be too small to be detectable in comparison to atmospheric temperature variations.

<h3><i><b><a name="365"></a>3.6.5. Radiative Impact of Additional or Changed Cirrus
  and Other Indirect Effects</b></i></h3>
<p>Besides forcing by line-shaped contrail cirrus, the global radiation balance
  may also be perturbed if there is a significant indirect effect of aircraft-induced
  aerosol, water vapor, and contrails on the coverage and properties (particle
  size distribution, number density, and composition) of "natural" cirrus clouds.
  In addition, there might be other indirect cloud-related effects, such as changes
  in humidity and precipitation. The principal effects might be similar to those
  caused by volcanic aerosol mixed down into the troposphere (see <a href="038.htm#345">Section
  3.4.5</a>). </p>
<p>Radiative forcing will be enhanced by any increase in the cover of thin cirrus
  caused by aircraft beyond that of line-shaped contrail cirrus. If the additional
  global cirrus cover is as large as 0.2% (the estimated upper bound for 1992;
  see <a href="039.htm#3515">Section 3.5.1.5</a>), and if the optical properties
  of this additional cirrus are the same as for line-shaped persistent contrails
  (optical depth of about 0.3, as also found often for natural cirrus; see <a href="038.htm#341">Section
  3.4.1</a>), then the radiative forcing from the additional cirrus may be as
  large as 0.04 W m<sup>-2</sup>-which is twice the value for line-shaped contrail cirrus.
</p>
<p>Aircraft emissions may also change the properties of natural cirrus clouds
  (see <a href="038.htm#345">Section 3.4.5</a>). In a high-traffic region, cirrus
  was found to be affected by soot emissions from aircraft, causing an approximate
  doubling of the ice particle concentration (Ström and Ohlsson, 1998). Smaller
  particles cause larger optical depth for constant ice water content. Radiative
  forcing is strongly sensitive to particle size (see <a href="040.htm#tab37">Table
  3-7</a>). As <a href="040.htm#img320">Figure 3-20</a> indicates, an increase in
  optical depth causes additional heating if the cirrus cloud was optically thin
  but cooling if it was optically thick (Wyser and Ström, 1998). One recent study
  suggests that the indirect heating effect of aviation-induced changes in cirrus
  ice particle number density for fixed cloud cover may be positive and comparable
  to or even larger than that from increases in cloud cover (Meerkötter et al.,
  1999). </p>
<p>While the impact of particle changes on radiative forcing by cirrus clouds
  may be studied parametrically, our understanding is very poor with respect to
  other indirect effects. Although comprehensive investigations are missing, there
  is no evidence that any of the indirect effects are important. <a href="040.htm#tab39">Table
  3-9</a> summarizes the assessment of global radiative forcing by aviation-induced
  cloudiness for 1992. The results for 2050 are explained in <a href="041.htm">Section
  3.7</a>. </p>
