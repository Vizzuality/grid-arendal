<H2><b>2.3. Uncertainties in the Impact Assessment of Present Aviation: Implications
  for Use of Models in Predicting Future Change</b> </H2>
<h3><b><a name="231"></a>2.3.1. Uncertainties in Modeling Aviation Impacts </b></h3>
<h4><i><a name="2311"></a>2.3.1.1. Key Issues and Processes for Tropospheric Models</i>
</h4>
<p>In performing assessments of the impacts of subsonic aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  on tropospheric composition, the modeling studies have pointed out several key
  issues and processes that have to be adequately addressed: </p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Model spatial and time resolution<br>
      Time resolution of meteorological data<br>
      Subgrid-scale processes (e.g., plume processes)<br>
      Tropospheric NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and NOy sources<br>
      Tropospheric gas-phase and heterogeneous chemistry<br>
      Stratospheric gas-phase and heterogeneous chemistry <br>
      Stratosphere-troposphere exchange<br>
      Upper troposphere-lower stratosphere dynamics and convective transport <br>
      Sources and sinks of water and NOy. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>These issues and processes are discussed in general terms in the paragraphs
  that follow. A detailed description of process representation in the assessment
  models is given in <a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>. </p>
<p>Over the years, there has been a steady increase in the spatial resolution
  of the models used in the assessment of subsonic aircraft impacts on tropospheric
  composition. Initially, the assessment models were one-dimensional (altitude),
  averaged around latitude circles and from north to south poles. Relatively quickly,
  researchers realized that interhemispheric gradients were crucial for ozone
  and anthropogenic trace gases, so much of the assessment work has been carried
  out with 2-D (altitude and latitude) models that average around latitude circles.
  With NO<span class="subscript">x</span> lifetimes of days or less and transport times around latitude circles
  of up to 2 weeks, researchers appreciated that 2-D models needed parameterizations
  to represent the main features of the distributions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and other short-lifetime
  species. Some research teams investigated 2-D channel models (altitude and longitude)
  models, but the development of 3-D chemistry transport models (CTMs) has been
  the main thrust of tropospheric modeling efforts.</p>
<p>Global 3-D CTMs are now the main tools for the assessment of subsonic aircraft
  impacts in the troposphere. Typically, these models have horizontal resolutions
  of 2-6� by 2-6�, limited by the resolution of the general circulation model
  (GCM) from which they have been derived. Emissions databases are now available
  with higher spatial resolution, so model performance is limited by the meteorological
  databases used in CTMs and the necessary computing time. Vertical resolution
  is a major limitation with current CTMs, in terms of the height taken as the
  top of the model and the number of layers into which the model domain is divided.
  Few models have enough vertical resolution to fully resolve the atmospheric
  boundary layer and tropopause domain and to describe the exchange of trace gases
  between the UT and the LS. </p>
<p>There is a major concern with 3-D CTMs regarding the adequacy of time resolution
  required in emission inventories and in meteorological data used to transport
  trace gases from their sources to their sinks. Initially, some CTMs used monthly
  averaged fields of horizontal and vertical winds, temperatures, clouds, and
  humidities. To resolve major storm systems and convective events, the meteorological
  data have been updated in the CTMs on a steadily increasing frequency; fields
  are now usually updated every 6 hours. On this basis, it is possible to resolve
  the changing stability of the atmospheric boundary layer, the developing behavior
  of major weather systems, and large-scale convective events. </p>
<p>Time and spatial resolution are crucial issues in evaluating the impacts of
  subsonic aircraft. To evaluate whether the chosen time and spatial resolutions
  are adequate in each of the tropospheric assessment tools, a number of sensitivity
  studies should be carried out in the near future. </p>
<p>Concentration changes occurring in the aircraft plume and wake take place on
  a spatial scale (i.e., < 20 km) that is less than the smallest global atmospheric
  model scale (i.e., > 100 km). Consequently, global models do not typically treat
  aircraft near-field processes in detail. In fact, most current global model
  studies have input aircraft emissions inventories (i.e., emissions indexes,
  or EI) by simple dilution of the aircraft plume at the altitude of injection,
  with no chemical changes taking place in the near field. As a possible means
  of connecting near-field processes to the global model grid scale, Petry et
  al. (1998) and Karol et al. (1998) have proposed the concept of effective emissions
  index (EEI) to account for changes in species concentrations in the plume dispersion
  region resulting from photochemical reactions. As an example, EEI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) will
  be less than the corresponding EIs because of plume processes that convert NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  to NOy. However, first estimates show that EEIs are very sensitive to temperature
  and light intensity, which results in a large variation of EEIs in latitude,
  altitude, and season (Karol et al., 1997; Meijer et al., 1997). </p>
<p>Recent ozone model studies have also pointed out the importance of background
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources in understanding ozone tendencies with respect to increasing, or
  additional, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources. In a sense, the aircraft case is one example of a broader
  issue regarding nonlinearity between ozone impacts and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels. Model studies
  have shown that the magnitude of ozone changes from aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions may
  depend significantly on the amount of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> from non-aircraft sources. One difficulty
  with modeling background NO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources, however, is the short lifetime of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  (typically 1-5 days). In general, aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> impacts on upper tropospheric
  and lower stratospheric ozone will be overstated if background NO<span class="subscript">x</span> concentrations
  are underestimated, and vice versa. </p>
<p>Over the past 2 decades, a significant amount of research has been committed
  to improving our understanding of background NO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources through model studies
  and observations of aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions. Much of the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the troposphere
  comes from surface NO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources, either via fast vertical transport as NO<span class="subscript">x</span> (Ehhalt
  et al., 1992) or by conversion to temporary reservoir NOy carriers such as PAN
  or HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>, followed by subsequent conversion back to NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. An accurate representation
  of the contribution made by surface NO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources to the UT and LS requires full
  treatment of boundary layer chemistry, exchanges between the boundary layer
  and the free troposphere, deposition and wet scavenging, free tropospheric chemistry
  and transport to the upper troposphere by convection, atmospheric circulation,
  and synoptic-scale weather systems. An estimate of annual flux into the free
  troposphere from European surface NO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources, as a fraction of the total surface
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> source, can be made from European Monitoring and Evaluation Program (EMEP)
  modeling studies (Tuovinen et al., 1994). For NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, 52% of the emitted NO<span class="subscript">x</span> was
  deposited within the EMEP area of Europe and 48% was exported out of the model
  region during 1985-93. Approximately half of this material is vented into the
  free troposphere as NOy (1.7 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>), with the remainder deposited elsewhere,
  without reaching the free troposphere. </p>
<p>In North America, a similar picture applies. Model calculations (Brost et al.,
  1988) have estimated that about 1.8 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup> (of total North American emissions
  of 7.9 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>) is transported east to the Atlantic Ocean between the surface
  and 5.5-km altitude. That is, about 25% of the North American NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  remained airborne in the boundary layer or free troposphere as the air left
  North America. More recent studies (Jacob et al., 1993; Horowitz et al., 1998;
  Liang et al., 1998) have derived a lower estimate of the transport out of North
  America (on the order of 6%). </p>
<p>A detailed model study of advective and convective venting of ozone, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and NO<span class="subscript">Y</span> out of the boundary layer over northwest Europe during July and October-November
  1991 showed that, of surface NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions, 7% were brought to the free troposphere
  as NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and 20% as NOy during the summer (Flatoy and Hov, 1996), with slightly
  smaller percentages during the fall. </p>
<p>Transport from the surface is therefore undoubtedly an important contributor
  to background NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. However, it is difficult to evaluate how well this process
  is handled in each of the tropospheric assessment models used for aviation impact
  calculations. </p>
<p>Lightning is an important NO<span class="subscript">x</span> source in the UT (Chameides et al., 1987; Lamarque
  et al., 1996). Because of its sporadic nature and small spatial scale (tens
  of km), it is exceedingly difficult to represent quantitatively in even the
  most complex of tropospheric models. Most model studies include some representation
  of lightning NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, with global total emissions in the range 1-10 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>. However,
  there is no consensus on how to represent this source with time of day, season,
  altitude, or spatially, nor how to treat lightning in concert with convection,
  cloud processing, and wet scavenging. </p>
<p>Stratospheric NOy is a further important source of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the UT and LS, through
  the photolysis of HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> (Murphy et al., 1993). There is a downward flux of NOy
  from the stratosphere to the troposphere that globally balances the stratospheric
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> source produced by the reaction of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O with O(1D). Few model studies of
  aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions extend high enough in altitude to include a full treatment
  of stratospheric NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and NOy. Moreover, most do not include an explicit representation
  of stratospheric chemistry (i.e., halogen chemistry) from which to realistically
  calculate stratospheric NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. Instead, most models use a constant ratio of NOy
  to ozone and describe the stratospheric NOy source in the same way as the stratosphere-troposphere
  exchange of ozone. Typical ozone to NOy ratios are assumed to be about 1000:1,
  giving a stratospheric NOy source in the UT of about 0.5 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

<p><br>
  Although the issue of the magnitude of background NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels has been clearly
  identified and much work has been performed to characterize surface, lightning,
  and stratospheric sources, there are still too few measurements of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and NOy
  in the UT and LS with which to assess quantitatively representations of background
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the models summarized in <a href="026.htm#tab21">Table 2-1</a>. Recently
  published data (Emmons et al., 1997) have begun to be used for evaluation of
  model performance (Wang et al., 1998b). </p>
<p>As discussed in <a href="023.htm#2124">Section 2.1.2.4</a>, the response of
  ozone to increasing NO<span class="subscript">x</span> depends on the strength of the HO<span class="subscript">x</span> source. Recent evidence
  (Brune et al., 1998; Wennberg et al., 1998) supports the presence of additional
  upper tropospheric HO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources from organic precursors that are not included
  in many current models. Improved model treatments of HO<span class="subscript">x</span> production from precursors
  such as acetone, peroxides, and aldehydes will require additional data on the
  mechanisms and kinetics of a number of NMHC reactions. The role of heterogeneous
  chemistry in influencing HO<span class="subscript">x</span> and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels in the UT has not been investigated
  fully yet and is expected to become an increasingly important issue for tropospheric
  models. </p>
<h4><i><a name="2312"></a>2.3.1.2. Tropospheric Model Evaluation</i></h4>
<p>Previous IPCC reports (IPCC, 1996) identified tropospheric ozone modeling as
  one of the more difficult tasks in atmospheric chemistry. Difficulties arise,
  in part, from the large number of processes that control tropospheric ozone
  and its precursors and, in part, from the large range of spatial and temporal
  scales that must be resolved. Global 3-D CTMs attempt to simulate the life cycles
  of many trace gases and the impacts of subsonic aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions on them.
  We need to understand the level of confidence that is to be ascribed to these
  model studies. </p>
<p>There is a significant amount of scatter in current model assessments of the
  impacts of subsonic aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions on all aspects of tropospheric composition.
  With respect to reducing the range of uncertainty, it would be helpful if we
  could point to particular aspects of model performance and gauge models against
  specified benchmarks. Some model evaluation studies have begun the difficult
  task of identifying the current level of model performance and defining the
  level of confidence that should be placed in them. To this end, a number of
  model intercomparison exercises have been completed; some are in hand, and some
  are only at the planning stage. These exercises have involved the following
  elements: </p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    <li>Transport of 222Rn<br>
    <li>Fast photochemistry <br>
    <li>Transport of NO<span class="subscript">x</span><br>
    <li>Comparison of model data and observations of tropospheric ozone.
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>2.3.1.2.1. Transport of 222Rn</i></h4>
<p>Twenty atmospheric models participated in the 222Rn intercomparison for global
  CTMs (IPCC, 1996; Jacob et al., 1997). Differences between model-calculated
  distributions of this short-lived (e-folding lifetime of 5.5 days) radioactive
  decay product emitted at the surface from soils were large, which enabled the
  drawing of conclusions about the general adequacy of transport schemes in CTMs.
  Owing to the lack of extensive observations, evaluation efforts to date have
  been restricted mainly to model-model intercomparisons. </p>
<p>The 222Rn model intercomparison concluded that tropospheric CTMs based on 2-D
  models and monthly averaged 3-D models have a fundamental flaw in transporting
  tracers predominantly by diffusion; thus, these models cannot be viewed as reliable
  in simulating the global transport of tracers. Synoptic 3-D models need significantly
  improved representations of boundary layer processes, clouds, and convection.
  Large differences are found among established 3-D CTMs in the rates of global-scale
  meridional transport in the UT-particularly, interhemispheric transport. These
  latter differences are particularly relevant to the current issue of subsonic
  aircraft impacts. </p>
<h4><i>2.3.1.2.2. Fast photochemistry</i></h4>
<p> More than 20 model groups participated in the tropospheric photochemical model
  intercomparison exercise, PhotoComp-a tightly controlled experiment in which
  consistency was determined among models used to predict tropospheric ozone changes
  (IPCC, 1996; Olson et al., 1997). A similar study, involving fewer models, was
  carried out as part of a U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration
  (NASA) assessment (Friedl, 1997). As with the radon case, there are no easy
  observational tests of model fast photochemistry, so model-model intercomparison
  exercises were carried out in both cases. </p>
<p> Over the intercomparison tests for fast photochemistry of the sunlit troposphere,
  modeled OH concentrations fell within a �20% band, and ozone changes fell within
  a �30% band. These obvious variations between model results did not correlate
  with other model differences, and no single model input parameter appeared to
  account for all of the spread in the results. Nevertheless, ozone photolysis
  rates used in the models accounted for about half of the root mean square (RMS)
  differences; further investigation of these parameters and their comparison
  with observations is called for. The results also became more uncertain in model
  experiments involving NMHCs. Further CTM development is required so that models
  have the required grid and time resolutions to simulate accurately the scales
  of chemistry required to describe the removal of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and NMHCs while producing
  and destroying ozone, quantitatively. </p>
<h4><i>2.3.1.2.3. Transport of NO<span class="subscript">x</span></i></h4>
<p>Passive transport of subsonic aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions has been studied with
  a hierachy of global CTMs (Friedl, 1997; van Velthoven et al., 1997). The 3-D
  CTMs showed that the monthly mean NO<span class="subscript">x</span> concentrations varied by a factor of three
  longitudinally and that the temporal variability of background NO<span class="subscript">x</span> in the air
  traffic corridor was about �30% on synoptic time scales. Vertical redistribution
  by convection strongly affected the maximum NO<span class="subscript">x</span> concentrations at subsonic aircraft
  cruise altitudes. </p>
<p>A number of model deficiencies and biases were found, including the oscillatory
  nature of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> distributions obtained with a spectral advection scheme, the strong
  diffusion of GCMs into polar regions, and the too-intense interhemispheric exchange
  found in some 2-D CTMs. The intercomparisons concluded that assessment of the
  tropospheric impacts of subsonic aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions could be performed better
  with 3-D CTMs. </p>
<h4><i>2.3.1.2.4. Comparison of model data and observations of tropospheric ozone
  </i></h4>
<p>An increasing number of activities are aimed at evaluating global model results
  in relation to ozone observations (Wang et al., 1998b; Wauben et al., 1998).
  However, there are too few ozone data, especially in the tropics, to allow for
  comprehensive evaluations. Comparisons are showing that model simulations are
  reproducing the broad features of monthly mean measured ozone concentrations.
  Some models do not produce the observed seasonality in the northern mid-latitude
  troposphere. Differences are most pronounced in the free troposphere, especially
  close to the tropopause (see <a href="028.htm#img27">Figure 2-7</a>). </p>
<p>As part of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project/Global Integration
  and Modeling Activity (IGAC/GIM) study, an intercomparison exercise is currently
  being attempted of ozone concentrations calculated by 12 global 3-D CTMs (Kanikidou
  et al., 1998). Many of these CTMs have already performed assessments of the
  impacts of subsonic aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions on tropospheric ozone; their results
  have been included in <a href="026.htm#tab21">Table 2-1</a>. Furthermore, all
  of the tropospheric assessment models employed in <a href="044.htm">Chapter
  4</a> have submitted results to the IGAC/GIM intercomparison. </p>
<p>The GIM intercomparison extends the intercomparisons described above in that
  it employs some of the available observational database to evaluate intermodel
  differences. <a href="028.htm#img27">Figure 2-7</a> presents some of the model
  intercomparison results for seasonal cycles of ozone at 300 mb at three widely
  separated sites. </p>
<p>The GIM model intercomparison with monthly mean values of observations demonstrates
  that the models capture some of the considerable variability within the observations.
  The range in observations may approach 20 ppb at 500 mb and up to 40 ppb at
  300 mb, with the ranges in the models significantly greater. These ranges are
  significantly greater than the tropospheric ozone impacts of about 8 ppb anticipated
  from subsonic aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions (<a href="026.htm#tab21">Table 2-1</a>).
</p>
<h4><i><a name="2313"></a>2.3.1.3. Key Issues and Processes for Stratospheric
  Models </i></h4>
<p>CFC and HSCT assessment activities have engaged 2-D (height and latitude) and,
  to some extent, 3-D (height, latitude, and longitude) models focused on the
  stratosphere over the past 10 years. These efforts have served to highlight
  a number of critical stratospheric model issues: </p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    <li>Aircraft plume processes <br>
    <li>Stratospheric transport <br>
    <li>Stratospheric gas-phase and heterogeneous chemistry <br>
    <li>Sulfate aerosol <br>
    <li>PSCs <br>
    <li>Soot.
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue of soot has been raised only to a small extent by the HSCT studies,
  although it has assumed a more prominent role in the subsonic aviation case
  (see <a href="024.htm">Section 2.1.3</a>). In the following paragraphs, we discuss
  these issues in the context of current model treatments of subsonic aviation
  impacts. </p>
<p>Aircraft emissions, whether supersonic or subsonic, are deposited primarily
  at northern mid-latitudes and over a limited vertical range. A key issue for
  models is how fast these emissions are dispersed to other regions of the atmosphere,
  such as the tropical stratosphere or the mid-latitude troposphere, where the
  response of ozone to the emissions will be substantially different. In addition,
  it is important to consider the chemistry occurring in the aircraft plume and
  wake before it has been expanded to the model grid scale. Initial attempts to
  combine near field, far field, and global models in series (Danilin et al.,
  1997) are the first global impact studies to be based directly on detailed microphysics
  and chemical kinetics occurring in the aircraft plume and wake. An increasingly
  robust plume and wake observational database is being collected to validate
  this approach (K�rcher, 1998; K�rcher et al., 1998b). </p>
<p>To date, most models used to assess the impact of aviation on the atmosphere
  have been 2-D, in which the time-consuming complexity of the real 3-D atmosphere
  is reduced to a manageable calculation by averaging around latitude circles.
  Because of this simplification, 2-D models do not adequately simulate all dynamic
  features of the atmosphere. Horizontal transport between mid-latitudes and the
  tropics (or polar vortex) is an inherently episodic, wave-driven process that
  is parameterized in 2-D models by eddy diffusion terms. Measurements of the NO<span class="subscript">Y</span>-to-ozone ratio in the LS have provided evidence for distinctly different
  airmass characteristics that are not well represented in 2-D models (Murphy
  et al., 1993; Minschwaner et al., 1996; Volk et al., 1996; Schoeberl et al.,
  1997). One method for improving the 2-D representation of tropical/extratropical
  air mass difference has been to reduce the horizontal eddy coefficient in the
  subtropical region. Efforts such as these have underscored the fact that an
  accurate model representation of tropical/mid-latitude air mass distinctions,
  including the extent of transport of tropical air into mid-latitudes, remains
  an important assessment uncertainty. </p>
<p>Model representation of bulk, global-scale vertical exchange between the stratosphere
  and the troposphere by diabatic circulation is likely adequate (Holton et al.,
  1995). However, most models do not adequately resolve tropopause-folding events
  or stratosphere-troposphere exchange along isentropic surfaces. To the extent
  that these processes are important, calculated aviation impacts will be sensitive
  to model horizontal and vertical resolution. </p>
<p>Model representation of gas-phase photochemical links between ozone and atmospheric
  trace species such as HO<span class="subscript">x</span> and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> may be the most mature area of model construction,
  although rate parameter uncertainties increase with decreasing temperature.
  This representation is facilitated by the existence of evaluated compilations
  of photochemical rate parameters (IUPAC, 1997a,b; JPL, 1997). Because of the
  sensitivity of reaction rates to temperature and photolysis rates to solar zenith
  angle, model treatments must account for temperature and solar flux changes
  as air parcels move around the globe and encounter day and nighttime conditions.
  Diurnal variations in calculated radical concentrations can be reproduced either
  by invoking an explicit time marching kinetic scheme or by applying a correction
  factor to concentrations calculated from averaged solar zenith angles. </p>
<p>The dependence of reaction rate coefficients on temperature, especially for
  PSC processes, can present a particular problem for 2-D models, which are constrained
  to zonal-mean temperature fields. One strategy to address zonal variations has
  been to describe the zonal mean temperature by a probability distribution (Considine
  et al., 1994). The applicability of this approach to PSC processes is an area
  of active investigation. Type II PSC particles, consisting of water-ice and
  uniformally formed at temperatures below 188 K, can be adequately captured in
  2-D formulations. However, the temperature thresholds for PSC type I particle
  formation are highly variable because of the multitude of possible particle
  compositions, and they depend more heavily on the temperature histories of air
  parcels. Some of the type I PSCs considered in stratospheric models include
  solid nitric acid hydrates (e.g., trihydrate and dihydrate), mixed hydrates,
  and supercooled sulfate, nitrate, and water ternary solutions (Worsnop et al.,
  1993; Carslaw et al., 1994; Tabazadeh et al., 1994; Fox et al., 1995). Compositional
  details of modeled PSC type Is are important because they determine what the
  model will calculate for the size, density, and removal rates (by sedimentation)
  of the particles as well as the partitioning of NOy between gaseous and condensed
  phases. </p>
<p>Finally, stratospheric models must describe background sulfate and carbonaceous
  aerosol formation and evolution adequately to gauge perturbations from aircraft
  SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O and soot emissions. In past studies, models have merely prescribed aerosol
  suface area distributions based on satellite observations. Recognition that
  aircraft exhaust may contain a large number of small-diameter sulfate particles
  has motivated development of aerosol microphysical schemes (Weisenstein et al.,
  1996). </p>
<h4><i><a name="2314"></a>2.3.1.4. Stratospheric Model Evaluation </i></h4>
<p>The growing body of satellite, balloon, and aircraft chemical and meteorological
  data for the middle atmosphere has made it possible to devise tests of photochemistry
  and transport within stratospheric models. A number of 2-D and 3-D models have
  participated in two major intercomparison efforts, Models and Measurements (M&M)
  I and II (Prather and Remsberg, 1993; Park, 1999). These comparisons have focused
  on testing the ability of these models to estimate the atmospheric effects of
  a proposed fleet of supersonic aircraft that would operate near 20 km. As a
  direct result of the first M&M effort, a number of errors in the models were
  identified and corrected. Both M&M efforts have served to highlight important
  tests of model representations. Because of the supersonic aircraft focus, however,
  less analysis has been directed at model performance in the lowermost stratosphere,
  where subsonic aviation effects are expected. With the exception of ozone representation,
  rigorous tests of model representation of the dynamics and chemistry of the
  lowermost stratosphere and UT have not been performed to date. Poor agreement
  between model predictions and observations of ozone in this region of the atmosphere
  (typical errors greater than 50%) suggests that significant improvement will
  be required before stratospheric assessment models can be used to examine the
  impact of aviation (or, for that matter, any perturbation) on the lowermost
  stratosphere and UT. In the following paragraphs, we summarize comparison efforts
  for the following key issues (for altitudes above 15 km): </p>

<h4><i>2.3.1.4.1. Photochemistry</i></h4>
<p>The photochemical mechanisms employed by most of the models compare well with
  each other. Tests of the photochemical mechanisms were performed by comparing
  predicted concentrations of short-lived reactive chemicals from these models
  against a benchmark photo-stationary state model constrained by the distribution
  of precursors from each 2-D model. These comparisons provide a means of accounting
  for differences in the transport of long-lived species, such as NOy, and O<span class="subscript">3</span>,
  within the models. The distribution of NOy versus altitude and the mixing ratio
  of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O was markedly different among the various 2-D models. Most of the differences
  for calculated concentrations of hydrogen, nitrogen, and chlorine free radicals
  among the various 2-D models were shown to be caused by differences in NOy and
  to a lesser degree ozone. The benchmark model has been tested extensively against
  atmospheric observations and has been shown to generally reproduce observed
  concentrations of OH, HO<span class="subscript">2</span>, NO, NO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and ClO in the stratosphere to within �30%,
  provided precursor fields and aerosol surface areas are accurately known. </p>

<p>However, no significant tests of the model photochemistry of the lowermost
  stratosphere were performed during the recent M&M workshop. The chemistry of
  this region is considerably different. For example, the relatively high ratio
  of CO to ozone implies that ozone production from the oxidation of CO is much
  more important in this region than at higher altitudes. Furthermore, at the
  tropopause and below, saturated conditions often exist; therefore, chemical
  processes occurring on ice particles may be important. In addition, because
  this air is influenced by mixing of reactive trace gases from the lower troposphere,
  these models must consider transport of a larger number of reactive species
  than they typically do. </p>
<h4><i>2.3.1.4.2. Dynamics </i></h4>
<p>Tests of the dynamics within the 2-D and 3-D models during both M&M I and II
  revealed a number of problems. In general, the mean age of air within the stratosphere
  is much older than predicted by these models. Measurements of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> (Boering et
  al., 1996) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF<span class="subscript">6</span>) (Elkins et al., 1996), both of which
  are increasing rapidly, provide a means of dating stratospheric air. The models
  had a high dispersion in predicted conversion rate of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O to NOy. It is unclear
  whether this dispersion reflects errors in dynamics or chemistry related to
  the high-altitude sink of NOy. This is a key point: If the assessment models
  are unable to accurately simulate observed concentrations of total NOy, their
  ability to predict the influence of additional NOy from aircraft on ozone will
  remain relatively uncertain. Transport in the lowermost stratosphere is considerably
  different, and in many ways even more difficult to represent in 2-D models,
  than transport at higher altitudes. This fact certainly does not bode well for
  the ability of current 2-D models to describe accurately the dynamic context
  within which the current subsonic fleet is operating. </p>
<h4><i>2.3.1.4.3. Comparison of model data and observations of stratospheric ozone
  </i></h4>
<p>As part of the M&M II effort, results from a group of stratospheric models
  were compared with a recently developed ozone climatology (WMO, 1998). The data
  used for the climatology are from sonde stations and from SAGE II, the latter
  data set having been evaluated by comparison with other satellite, lidar, sonde,
  and Umkehr data. Although agreement between models and between models and observations
  is relatively good above 25 km, differences between modeled and observed ozone
  are found to increase rapidly below 25 km and are largest between 20 km and
  the tropopause. The modeled ozone tends to be larger than observed ozone by
  up to a factor of 2 at these altitudes. </p>
<p>Overestimation of LS ozone in some models may be ascribed partly to the fact
  that they have tropopauses at mid-latitudes that are either invariant or do
  not vary correctly with season. However, based on chemistry and dynamics tests
  described in the preceding subsections, it is likely that differences between
  models and observations are caused in large part by deficencies in model transport
  representation. </p>
<h4><i><a name="2315"></a>2.3.1.5. Implications for Modeling Aviation Impacts
  </i></h4>
<p>Global tropospheric 3-D CTMs are now the main modeling tools for climate-chemistry
  studies, including the role of subsonic aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions. Although 3-D
  models with high temporal and spatial resolution have performed significantly
  better than 2-D or monthly averaged 3-D CTMs in the 222Rn, PhotoComp, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and
  Ozone/GIM intercomparison exercises, key fundamental problems have been identified
  that are crucial to the representation of the impacts of subsonic NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  from aircraft. </p>
<p>3-D CTM studies have provided only preliminary estimates of subsonic impacts,
  which exhibit significant scatter, as <a href="026.htm#tab21">Table 2-1</a>
  shows. At present, we are unable to rationalize these real differences in results
  between studies because there is no one aspect of input data or process parameterization
  that can account for the spread in model results. Furthermore, the extent of
  model evaluation is highly variable, and no models have been evaluated comprehensively
  against all of the key issues detailed in <a href="028.htm#2311">Section 2.3.1.1</a>.
</p>
<p>These same difficulties apply to the subset of models adopted in <a href="044.htm">Chapter
  4</a> to examine the future impact of subsonic aircraft. There is no suggestion
  that these models have any distinguishing features that identify them as being
  inherently more or less reliable for assessment of the tropospheric impacts
  of subsonic aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions. Furthermore, we have no concrete means of
  establishing a higher level of confidence in the models used in <a href="044.htm">Chapter
  4</a>, compared with any of the similar 3-D models listed in <a href="026.htm#tab21">Table
  2-1</a>. </p>
<p>Although the effects of present aviation on ozone are calculated to be much
  smaller in the stratosphere than in the troposphere -primarily because of the
  smaller fraction of exhaust released into the stratosphere-the performance of
  2-D stratospheric models has not been extensively evaluated in the lowermost
  stratospheric region. Consequently, the results reported in <a href="028.htm#2313">Section
  2.3.1.3</a> represent only preliminary estimates of subsonic aviation impacts
  on the stratosphere. The modeling situation is significantly better for evaluating
  the effects of future supersonic aircraft in that a number of intercomparisons
  have established the general quality of modeled middle stratosphere photochemistry.
  However, confident predictions of stratospheric effects of future aviation will
  require resolution of discrepancies between modeled and observed transport tracers.
</p>
<h3><b><a name="232"></a>2.3.2. Uncertainties in Observing Aviation Impacts</b></h3>
<p>The data set resulting from ozonesondes is the only useful one for ozone trend
  analysis in the UT and LS. The error of an individual ozonesonde measurement
  has been evaluated to be ~5% in the LS, based on several intercomparison campaigns
  (WMO, 1998). The error is larger in the UT, where ozone densities, hence instrument
  signals, are substantially smaller. In addition, the background signals (i.e.,
  dark current) of the sonde sensors have been checked relatively infrequently
  during the measurement period, giving rise to further measurement uncertainty.
  If the measurement error is random, one can improve the statistical significance
  of observed trends by increasing the observation frequency. Ozone densities
  vary greatly on time scales of days in the UT and LS, particularly in middle
  and high latitudes during the winter and spring. The cause of this variability
  is believed to be related to active dynamic transport associated with weather
  disturbances. Because the variability is largely random, it can be treated,
  to first order, as noise in the trend data. The variability is considered to
  be of the same order of magnitude (or larger) as noise from instrument measurement
  errors. The frequency of ozonesonde observation-once a week at most stations-is
  not enough to document these variations properly. </p>
<p>Long-term trends of external forcings other than aircraft greatly complicate
  analysis of ozone trends. The long-term variation of atmospheric chlorine loading
  is relatively well-documented, allowing for the construction of credible models
  to predict stratospheric ozone depletion. However, changes in gases important
  in UT photochemistry-such as NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, oxygenated hydrocarbons, and water vapor-are
  much less well characterized. Feedbacks on tropospheric gases from climatic
  changes (e.g., greenhouse warming) may also have an impact on ozone in the UT
  and LS, but even the sign of this effect on ozone levels is uncertain. </p>
<p>In summary, because the database for ozone observations in the UT and LS is
  still relatively limited and because uncertainties in observational data, as
  well as model representations of non-aircraft ozone forcing phenomena, are quite
  large, it is presently impossible to associate a trend in ozone to aircraft
  operation with meaningful statistical significance. </p>
<H2><b><a name="24"></a>2.4. Conclusions and Overall Assessment of Present Aviation
  Impacts on Ozone</b></H2>
<p>Currently, there is no experimental evidence for a large geographical effect
  of aircraft emissions on ozone anywhere in the troposphere. Furthermore, the
  only evidence for an effect on NO<span class="subscript">x</span>-the major ozone precursor in aircraft emissions
  anywhere outside the immediate vicinity (i.e., a few miles) of a jet engine's
  exhaust-has been obtained during a stagnant meterological condition when exhaust
  products built up over several days. Nevertheless, our understanding of UT/LS
  chemical and dynamical processes continues to improve and has progressed to
  a point where one can predict with some confidence the cruise-level effects
  of aviation. </p>
<p>Based on our current overall understanding of UT and LS processes, we are confident
  that NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from present subsonic aircraft lead to increased NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and
  ozone concentrations at cruise altitudes, especially in air traffic corridors
  between and over Northern Hemisphere continents and at altitudes of 9-13 km.
  Based on the relatively large number of tropospheric model calculations, we
  are reasonably confident that tropospheric ozone increases from aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  have been on the order of 8 ppb, equivalent to 6% of the ozone density in the
  principal traffic areas. </p>
<p>Model studies, which have internal uncertainties associated with process parameterization
  and external uncertainties associated with the strengths of other very large
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources, have returned effects as low as 2% of the ozone density in high-traffic
  areas and as high as 14% in those areas. One of the major current limitations
  to the models' credibility in assessing aircraft emissions is the identification
  and quantification of background NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels and sources. Recent HO<span class="subscript">x</span> measurements
  allow for a much better understanding of ozone production in the UT, and these
  measurements have shown that additional HO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources are necessary to explain
  the observations. Moreover, these additional HO<span class="subscript">x</span> sources cause the sensitivity
  of ozone production from NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions to be higher than previously thought.
</p>
<p>Much less confidence is attached to our understanding of the effects of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  emissions in the lowermost stratosphere and aerosol emissions in the troposphere
  and stratosphere. The available data suggest that these effects are smaller
  than (and, in the case of aerosols, of opposite sign) those of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  in the UT (see <a href="028.htm#img28">Figure 2-8</a>). </p>
<p>Based on our model predictions, the impact of present subsonic NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  on ozone is well within the range of interannual variability of ozone concentrations
  in the UT as measured with ozonesondes. Furthermore, expressed as a decadal
  trend, the impact of subsonic NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions on upper tropospheric and lower
  stratospheric ozone is smaller than or comparable to the span of confidence
  limits in the ozone trend analysis for mid-latitude stations. Finally, we note
  that aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions should lead to decreased CH<span class="subscript">4</span> concentrations; however,
  any impact should be undetectable in the CH<span class="subscript">4</span> record.<br>
