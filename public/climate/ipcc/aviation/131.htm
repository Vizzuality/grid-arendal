<!-- #BeginEditable "Page_Content_Here" --> <h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Three-dimensional (latitude, longitude, altitude) global inventories of civil
  and military aircraft fuel burned and emissions have been developed for the
  United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for the years
  1976, 1984, and 1992, and by the European Abatement of Nuisances Caused by Air
  Transport (ANCAT)/European Commission (EC) Working Group and the Deutsches Zentrum
  fï¿½r Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) for 1991/92. For 1992, the results of the inventory
  calculations are in good agreement, with total fuel used by aviation calculated
  to be 129.3 Tg (DLR), 131.2 Tg (ANCAT), and 139.4 Tg (NASA). Total emissions
  of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> (as NO<span class="subscript">2</span>) in 1992 were calculated to range from 1.7 Tg (NASA) to 1.8 Tg
  (ANCAT and DLR). </p>
<p>Forecasts of air travel demand and technology developed by NASA and ANCAT for
  2015 have been used to create three-dimensional (3-D) data sets of fuel burn
  and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions for purposes of modeling the near-term effects of aircraft.
  The NASA 2015 forecast results in a global fuel burn of 309 Tg, with a NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission
  of 4.1 Tg (as NO<span class="subscript">2</span>); the global emission index, EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) (g NO<span class="subscript">x</span>/kg fuel), is 13.4.
  In contrast, the ANCAT 2015 forecast results in lower values-a global fuel burn
  of 287 Tg, an emission of 3.5 Tg of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and a global emission index of 12.3.
  The differences arise from the distribution of air travel demand and technology
  assumptions. </p>
<p>Long-term emission scenarios for CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> from subsonic aviation in 2050
  have been constructed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
  Forecasting and Economic Support Group (FESG); the United Kingdom Department
  of Trade and Industry (DTI); and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), whose
  projections extend to 2100. The FESG and EDF scenarios used the Intergovernmental
  Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) IS92 scenarios for economic growth to project
  future air traffic demand, though with different approaches to the relative
  importance of gross domestic product (GDP) and population. Each group also makes
  different assumptions about projected improvements in fleet fuel efficiency
  and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reduction technology. In addition, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  (MIT) has projected emissions from a "high speed" sector that includes aviation,
  and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has published a projection of aviation
  emissions for the year 2041. </p>
<p>All future scenarios were constructed by assuming that the necessary infrastructure
  (e.g., airports, air traffic control) will be developed as needed and that fuel
  supplies will be available. System capacity constraints, if any, have not been
  evaluated. </p>
<p>Future scenarios predict fuel use and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions that vary over a wide range,
  depending on the economic growth scenario and model used for the calculations.
  Although none of the scenarios are considered impossible as outcomes for 2050,
  some of the EDF high-growth scenarios are believed to be less plausible. The
  FESG low-growth scenarios, though plausible in terms of achievability, use traffic
  estimates that are very likely to be exceeded given the present state of the
  industry and planned developments. </p>
<p>The 3-D gridded outputs from all of the FESG 2050 scenarios and from the DTI
  2050 scenario are suitable for use as input to chemical transport models and
  may also be used to calculate the effect of aviation CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions. The FESG
  scenarios project aviation fuel use in 2050 to be in the range of 471-488 Tg,
  with corresponding NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions of 7.2 and 5.5 Tg (as NO<span class="subscript">2</span>) for IS92a, depending
  on the technology scenario; 268-277 Tg fuel and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> of 4.0 and 3.1 Tg for IS92c;
  and 744-772 Tg fuel and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> of 11.4 and 8.8 Tg for IS92e. (For all of the individual
  FESG IS92-based scenarios, higher fuel usage-thus CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions-were a result
  of the more aggressive NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reduction technology assumed). The DTI scenario projects
  aviation fuel use in 2050 to be 633 Tg, with NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions at 4.5 Tg. </p>
<p>As a result of higher projected fuel usage, EDF projections of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions
  are all higher than those of FESG by factors of approximately 2.4 to 4.3 for
  IS92a, 3.1 to 5.7 for IS92c, and 1.7 to 3.1 for IS92e. Results from EDF scenarios
  based on IS92a and IS92d are suitable for use in calculating the effect of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  emissions as sensitivity analyses; the latter scenario projects CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions
  levels from aviation 2.2 times greater in 2050 than the highest of the FESG
  scenarios. </p>
<p> The effects of a fleet of high-speed civil transport (HSCT) aircraft on fuel
  burned and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions in the year 2050 were calculated using the FESG year
  2050 subsonic inventories as a base. A fleet of 1,000 HSCTs operating with a
  program goal EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) of 5 in 2050 was calculated to increase global fuel burned
  by 12-18% and reduce global NO<span class="subscript">x</span> by 1-2% (depending on the scenario chosen),
  assuming that low-NO<span class="subscript">x</span> HSCTs displace traffic from the higher NO<span class="subscript">x</span> subsonic fleet.
  A fleet of 1,000 HSCT aircraft was chosen to evaluate the effect of a large
  fleet; it does not constitute a forecast of the size of an HSCT fleet in 2050.
</p>
<p>The simplifying assumptions used in calculating
  all of the historical and present-day 3-D inventories (1976 through 1992)-great
  circle routing, no winds, standard temperatures, no cargo payload-cause a systematic
  underestimate of fuel burned (therefore emissions produced) by aviation on the
  order of 15%, so calculated values were scaled up accordingly. By 2015, we assume
  that the introduction of advanced air traffic management systems will reduce
  this underestimate to approximately 5%. Full implementation of these systems
  by 2050 should reduce the error somewhat further, but given the wide range of
  year 2050 scenario projections, adjustments to calculated fuel values in 2050
  were not considered to be necessary.</p>
