<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>This chapter assesses what is known about measures already being taken or that
  might be taken to improve the fuel efficiency of aviation through changes in
  aircraft operations and changes in the way air traffic is managed against a
  background of continuing growth in air transport activity. The objective of
  such improvement in fuel efficiency is to reduce the amount of fuel consumed
  for a given demand for air transportation-which would have the effect of reducing
  emissions. </p>
<p>The existing air navigation system and its subsystems suffer from technical,
  operational, political, procedural, economic, social, and implementation shortcomings.
  The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), national airworthiness
  authorities, regional bodies, and private-sector stakeholders have identified
  the need for radical improvement of the air traffic management system to accommodate
  the continuing growth of aviation and to promote efficient airspace use. Implementation
  of a new concept for air traffic management that includes enhanced communications,
  navigation, and surveillance in support of an improved air traffic management
  system has already begun. Communications, navigation, and surveillance/air traffic
  management (CNS/ATM) systems benefit the air transportation sector by reducing
  delays, increasing the capacity of existing infrastructure, and improving operational
  efficiency. This system results in fuel savings, hence reduced emissions for
  a given demand. </p>
<p>Several studies associated with the implementation of CNS/ ATM systems have
  been carried out. Although some of these studies provide results in terms of
  cost/benefit and associated fuel savings and do not specifically address environmental
  benefits, there is an obvious correlation with reductions in gaseous emissions.
  These studies suggest that improvements in air traffic management could help
  to improve overall fuel efficiency by 6-12%. </p>
<p>Other strategies that exist for mitigating the environmental impact of emissions
  from aviation could achieve environmental benefits through reduced fuel burn.
  These strategies include: optimizing aircraft speed, reducing additional weight,
  increasing the load factor, reducing nonessential fuel on board, limiting the
  use of auxiliary power units, and reducing taxiing. Airlines are already under
  strong pressure to optimize these parameters, largely because of economic considerations
  and requirement within the industry to minimize operational costs. The potential
  reduction in fuel burn by further optimization of these operational measures
  is in the range of 2-6%. </p>
<p>To answer the question of whether emissions reductions could be achieved by
  substituting the use of air transport by other modes, several studies have compared
  fuel burn and carbon dioxide emissions from different modes of transport. The
  amount of carbon dioxide emitted per passenger-km for the different modes of
  transport is very dependent on the distance travelled; the type of aircraft,
  train, or car; the load factor; and the source of energy used. Substitution
  of rail and coach for air travel could result in the reduction of emissions
  per passenger-km. However, the potential reduction would be achieved only for
  passengers travelling relatively short distances and only on high-density routes
  that have rail or coach links. Finally, substituting other transport modes for
  air transport could have environmental impacts on, for example, local air quality
  and noise exposure (which are outside the scope of this report).</p>
