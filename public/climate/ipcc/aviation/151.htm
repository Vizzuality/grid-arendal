<!-- #BeginEditable "Page_Content_Here" --> <h2>10.2. Institutional Framework </h2>
<h3><a name="1021"></a>10.2.1. International Civil Aviation Organization </h3>
<p>Because of the international nature of aviation and the need to promote international
  standards of safety, regulation of air transport is harmonized on a worldwide
  basis as much as possible through ICAO, a UN specialized agency established
  in 1944 under the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the "Chicago Convention")
  (ICAO, 1997a). With the technical support of states and the aviation community,
  ICAO has developed international standards and recommended practices for aviation.
  These standards and practices are attached as annexes to the Chicago Convention
  and are considered binding. However, if any state finds it impossible to comply
  with them, the state is required to inform ICAO of any differences. ICAO also
  provides guidance material for states on various aspects of international civil
  aviation. </p>
<p>In addition to operating under the harmonization achieved through ICAO, international
  flights are also subject to bilateral air service agreements between states.
  Although ICAO's mandate relates to international civil aviation, most states
  also take ICAO's international standards and recommended practices and guidance
  material into account in regulating their domestic aviation. </p>
<p>The ICAO strategic action plan acknowledged "a perception that the aviation
  sector may be contributing unduly to both existing and future environmental
  problems." The ICAO program of implementation action on the strategic action
  plan for the 1996-98 triennium lists several activities that could be relevant
  to environmental issues (ICAO, 1997c). </p>
<p>In the environmental field, ICAO has established standards for aircraft noise
  and aircraft engine emissions (Annex 16), as well as standards and procedures
  for operational measures such as landing and departure (ICAO, 1993a,b). It has
  also developed broader policy guidance on fuel taxation and charging principles
  that have relevance in an emissions context (ICAO, 1994, 1997b). </p>
<p>Much of ICAO's work in the environmental field is undertaken by its Committee
  on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP). CAEP examines the effectiveness
  and reliability of proposed aircraft certification schemes from the viewpoint
  of technical feasibility, economic reasonableness, and environmental need. CAEP
  also examines other issues related to emissions from aircraft engines-including
  international and national research into the impact of emissions and possible
  means of controlling emissions, such as operational measures and emissions-related
  levies. CAEP works closely with regional bodies and national airworthiness authorities
  to discuss and propose changes in recommended environmental standards. </p>
<h3><a name="1022"></a>10.2.2. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
  Change </h3>
<p>Although the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
  does not specifically refer to emissions from aviation, its coverage includes
  emissions from all sources. One of the commitments in the Convention is that
  parties to the Convention compile national inventories of their emissions sources
  (UNFCCC, 1992). </p>
<p>IPCC guidelines provide advice on the quantification of aviation emissions
  (IPCC, 1996e). Even after aviation emissions have been quantified, an important
  distinction is whether such emissions are domestic or international. For domestic
  flights, emissions are considered to be part of the national inventory of the
  country within which the flights occur. The IPCC guidelines require international
  aviation emissions to be estimated by the country where the fuel is sold, although
  such emissions are not to be included in that country's total emissions. For
  international flights, the problem is how to allocate the emissions (referred
  to as "emissions from international aviation bunker fuels" in UNFCCC terminology,
  although "international" is not always specified) to national inventories. A
  similar problem exists for shipping. </p>
<p>In an attempt to resolve this problem, the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific
  and Technological Advice (SBSTA) has been presented with the following allocation
  options for emissions from international aviation and marine bunker fuels (UNFCCC,
  1996): </p>
<ul>
  <p>. Option 1-No allocation <br>
    . Option 2-Allocation of global bunker sales and associated emissions to parties
    in proportion to their national emissions <br>
    . Option 3-Allocation according to the country where the bunker fuel is sold<br>
    . Option 4-Allocation according to the nationality of the transporting company,
    or to the country where an aircraft or ship is registered, or to the country
    of the operator <br>
    . Option 5-Allocation according to the country of departure or destination
    of an aircraft or vessel; alternatively, emissions related to the journey
    of an aircraft or vessel shared by the country of departure and the country
    of arrival <br>
    . Option 6-Allocation according to the country of departure or destination
    of passengers or cargo; alternatively, emissions related to the journey of
    passengers or cargo shared by the country of departure and the country of
    arrival <br>
    . Option 7-Allocation according to the country of origin of passengers or
    owner of cargo <br>
    . Option 8-Allocation to a party of all emissions generated in its national
    space. </p>
</ul>
<p>SBSTA subsequently noted that there were three separate issues: adequate and
  consistent inventories, allocation of emissions, and control options. Appropriate
  allocation of responsibility for emissions from international bunker fuels would
  be connected to inventory and control issues. Reviewing the foregoing eight
  options, SBSTA decided that Options 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 should be the basis for
  further work on this issue (UNFCCC, 1997). </p>
<p>To date, however, there has been no agreement among parties to the Convention
  on which option to choose. At Kyoto in December 1997, the Conference of Parties
  to the UNFCCC urged SBSTA to elaborate further on the inclusion of emissions
  from fuel sold to aircraft and ships engaged in international transport in overall
  greenhouse gas inventories (UNFCCC, 1998a). </p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, which has not yet entered into force, requires
  Annex I (industrialized) countries to reduce their collective emissions of greenhouse
  gases by approximately 5% by 2008-2012 compared with 1990 levels, with the reduction
  varying from country to country. The agreed-on targets apply to national totals
  of greenhouse gases. Consequently, each Annex I country can determine how the
  various emission-producing sectors in its economy should be called upon to assist
  in achieving the country's national target. </p>
<p>Because international aviation and marine emissions are not included in national
  inventories, they are currently excluded from the agreed-on targets. However,
  the treatment of aviation and marine emissions was considered in Kyoto in the
  context of discussions on policies and measures to be pursued by Annex I countries,
  and a provision was included in the Kyoto Protocol. The relevant text (Article
  2, paragraph 2) reads as follows: </p>
<p>"The Parties included in Annex I shall pursue limitation or reduction of emissions
  of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol from aviation and
  marine bunker fuels, working through the International Civil Aviation Organization
  and the International Maritime Organization, respectively." (UNFCCC, 1998b)
</p>
<p>A question has since arisen in the aviation community regarding whether this
  provision covers emissions from international aviation only or emissions from
  both international and domestic aviation. Although this issue has not been resolved,
  ICAO commented in a statement to the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC in
  November 1998 that ICAO's mandate (from the 1944 Convention on International
  Civil Aviation) does not extend to domestic aviation but that ICAO's standards,
  recommended practices, and procedures in many circumstances have a de facto
  application domestically (ICAO, 1998c). </p>
<p>At the ICAO assembly in September/October 1998, the ICAO Council was asked
  to study policy options to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions from civil
  aviation-taking into account the findings of this IPCC Special Report and the
  requirements of the Kyoto Protocol-and to report to the Assembly at its next
  ordinary session in 2001. ICAO was also asked to work with SBSTA to consider
  the various options for allocation of emissions from international aviation
  (ICAO, 1998b).</p>
