<H2>6. What are the Options to Reduce Emissions and Impacts? </H2>
<p><i>There is a range of options to reduce the impact of aviation emissions,
  including changes in aircraft and engine technology, fuel, operational practices,
  and regulatory and economic measures. These could be implemented either singly
  or in combination by the public and/or private sector. Substantial aircraft
  and engine technology advances and the air traffic management improvements described
  in this report are already incorporated in the aircraft emissions scenarios
  used for climate change calculations. Other operational measures, which have
  the potential to reduce emissions, and alternative fuels were not assumed in
  the scenarios. Further technology advances have the potential to provide additional
  fuel and emissions reductions. In practice, some of the improvements are expected
  to take place for commercial reasons. The timing and scope of regulatory, economic,
  and other options may affect the introduction of improvements and may affect
  demand for air transport. Mitigation options for water vapor and cloudiness
  have not been fully addressed. </i></p>
<p>Safety of operation, operational and environmental performance, and costs are
  dominant considerations for the aviation industry when assessing any new aircraft
  purchase or potential engineering or operational changes. The typical life expectancy
  of an aircraft is 25 to 35 years. These factors have to be taken into account
  when assessing the rate at which technology advances and policy options related
  to technology can reduce aviation emissions.</p>
<H2>6.1. Aircraft and Engine Technology Options<a name="spm61"></a></H2>
<p><i>Technology advances have substantially reduced most emissions per passenger-km.
  However, there is potential for further improvements. Any technological change
  may involve a balance among a range of environmental impacts. </i></p>
<p>Subsonic aircraft being produced today are about 70% more fuel efficient per
  passenger-km than 40 years ago. The majority of this gain has been achieved
  through engine improvements and the remainder from airframe design improvement.
  A 20% improvement in fuel efficiency is projected by 2015 and a 40 to 50% improvement
  by 2050 relative to aircraft produced today. The 2050 scenarios developed for
  this report already incorporate these fuel efficiency gains when estimating
  fuel use and emissions. Engine efficiency improvements reduce the specific fuel
  consumption and most types of emissions; however, contrails may increase and,
  without advances in combuster technology, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions may also increase.</p>
<p>Future engine and airframe design involves a complex decision-making process
  and a balance of considerations among many factors (e.g., carbon dioxide emissions,
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions at ground level, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions at altitude, water vapor emissions,
  contrail/cirrus production, and noise). These aspects have not been adequately
  characterized or quantified in this report. </p>
<p>Internationally, substantial engine research programs are in progress, with
  goals to reduce Landing and Take-off cycle (LTO) emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> by up to 70%
  from today's regulatory standards, while also improving engine fuel consumption
  by 8 to 10%, over the most recently produced engines, by about 2010. Reduction
  of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions would also be achieved at cruise altitude, though not necessarily
  by the same proportion as for LTO. Assuming that the goals can be achieved,
  the transfer of this technology to significant numbers of newly produced aircraft
  will take longer-typically a decade. Research programs addressing NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  from supersonic aircraft are also in progress. </p>
<H2>6.2. Fuel Options<a name="spm62"></a></H2>
<p><i>There would not appear to be any practical alternatives to kerosene-based
  fuels for commercial jet aircraft for the next several decades. Reducing sulfur
  content of kerosene will reduce SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O emissions and sulfate particle formation.
  </i></p>
<p>Jet aircraft require fuel with a high energy density, especially for long-haul
  flights. Other fuel options, such as hydrogen, may be viable in the long term,
  but would require new aircraft designs and new infrastructure for supply. Hydrogen
  fuel would eliminate emissions of carbon dioxide from aircraft, but would increase
  those of water vapor. The overall environmental impacts and the environmental
  sustainability of the production and use of hydrogen or any other alternative
  fuels have not been determined. </p>
<p>The formation of sulfate particles from aircraft emissions, which depends on
  engine and plume characteristics, is reduced as fuel sulfur content decreases.
  While technology exists to remove virtually all sulfur from fuel, its removal
  results in a reduction in lubricity. </p>
<H2>6.3. Operational Options<a name="spm63"></a></H2>
<p><i>Improvements in air traffic management (ATM) and other operational procedures
  could reduce aviation fuel burn by between 8 and 18%. The large majority (6
  to 12%) of these reductions comes from ATM improvements which it is anticipated
  will be fully implemented in the next 20 years. All engine emissions will be
  reduced as a consequence. In all aviation emission scenarios considered in this
  report the reductions from ATM improvements have already been taken into account.
  The rate of introduction of improved ATM will depend on the implementation of
  the essential institutional arrangements at an international level. &nbsp;</i></p>
<p>Air traffic management systems are used for the guidance, separation, coordination,
  and control of aircraft movements. Existing national and international air traffic
  management systems have limitations which result, for example, in holding (aircraft
  flying in a fixed pattern waiting for permission to land), inefficient routings,
  and sub-optimal flight profiles. These limitations result in excess fuel burn
  and consequently excess emissions. </p>
<p>For the current aircraft fleet and operations, addressing the above-mentioned
  limitations in air traffic management systems could reduce fuel burned in the
  range of 6 to 12%. It is anticipated that the improvement needed for these fuel
  burn reductions will be fully implemented in the next 20 years, provided that
  the necessary institutional and regulatory arrangements have been put in place
  in time. The scenarios developed in this report assume the timely implementation
  of these ATM improvements, when estimating fuel use. </p>
<p>Other operational measures to reduce the amount of fuel burned per passenger-km
  include increasing load factors (carrying more passengers or freight on a given
  aircraft), eliminating non-essential weight, optimizing aircraft speed, limiting
  the use of auxiliary power (e.g., for heating, ventilation), and reducing taxiing.
  The potential improvements in these operational measures could reduce fuel burned,
  and emissions, in the range 2 to 6%. </p>
<p>Improved operational efficiency may result in attracting additional air traffic,
  although no studies providing evidence on the existence of this effect have
  been identified. </p>
