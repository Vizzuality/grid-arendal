<h2>8.1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The air transport industry has grown rapidly over recent years, and growth
  is expected to continue. An effect of this growth is an increasing amount of
  emitted exhaust gases and consequential environmental impact. <a href="130.htm">Chapter
  9</a> discusses aspects of this growth. </p>
<p><a href="118.htm">Chapter 8</a> is the second of two chapters that assess what
  is known about means of addressing adverse environmental impacts associated
  with aircraft engine emissions. Whereas <a href="088.htm">Chapter 7</a> considers
  how aircraft and their engines might be improved, this chapter assesses what
  is known about measures that might be, or have been, taken to change aircraft
  operations and improve air traffic management (ATM) systems and procedures to
  reduce the amount of fuel consumed, which would have the effect of reducing
  emissions. Aircraft operations and measures that could be taken to improve efficiency
  are well understood, but only limited knowledge exists on the potential environmental
  impact of many of these measures. </p>
<p><a href="121.htm">Section 8.2</a> describes the constraints and limitations
  of the conventional ATM system and changes that are presently being implemented
  through new technology and improved procedures, as well as changes anticipated
  for the future designed to create a more integrated, global system of air traffic
  management. Whereas inefficient routings, cruising at less than optimum flight
  levels, and airborne holdings that characterize the present system result in
  unnecessary amounts of emissions injected into the atmosphere, new systems and
  procedures could result in fuel savings, hence reductions of emissions for a
  given demand for air transportation. </p>
<p><a href="124.htm">Section 8.3</a> discusses potential fuel reductions from
  other (non-ATM) operational factors, including improvement of aircraft utilization,
  optimization of speed, reductions in weight and nonessential fuel on board,
  limiting the use of auxiliary power units, and reduced taxiing. The airlines'
  need to contain fuel costs already provide a powerful incentive for progressive
  improvements in these areas. Application of these measures is restricted to
  some degree, however, by safety and regulatory aspects. </p>
<p>To answer the question of whether emissions reductions could be achieved by
  substituting other modes of travel for air transport, several studies have compared
  fuel burn and carbon dioxide emissions from different modes of transport. This
  comparison between carbon dioxide emissions for different modes of transport
  is discussed in <a href="124.htm">Section 8.3</a>. </p>
<p>Throughout this chapter, the assumption is made that improvements in operations
  and fuel efficiency will lead to reductions in emissions. Improved efficiency
  however, may result in attracting additional air traffic, although no studies
  providing evidence on the existence of this so-called rebound effect have been
  identified. In this respect, the scenarios presented in <a href="130.htm">Chapter
  9</a> have assumed an optimized air traffic management system. As a consequence,
  <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a> includes the effects of an optimized ATM system
  for air transport demand and related emissions. <a href="118.htm">Chapter 8</a>
  discusses the relation between improved operational efficiency and emissions
  for a given demand for air transport. </p>
