<h2> 7.8. Aviation Fuels</h2>
<p>This section addresses the major fuel-related issues that have influenced and
  will continue to influence the development of aircraft into the foreseeable
  future. Almost all current civil and military aviation around the world uses
  a kerosene-type fuel. This class of fuel provides a good balance of properties
  currently required from an aviation fuel, in which energy density, operational
  issues, cost, and safety all need to be taken into account. This section examines
  some alternative fuels that will, no doubt, continue to be considered as the
  demand for air transport continues and its impact on the environment grows.

<p>Fuel specifications that define physical properties, chemical composition,
  and performance tests have evolved over several decades. These fuel specifications
  are designed to balance quality, cost, and availability, thus guarantee a product
  of worldwide consistency. Although many countries have their own fuel specification,
  by general agreement among governing bodies, fuel suppliers, and aircraft manufacturers,
  all civil aviation fuel must effectively meet the requirements of American Society
  of Testing and Materials (ASTM) D1655 (ASTM, 1997) and Defense Evaluation and
  Research Agency (DERA) DEF STAN 91-91 (DERA, 1998). The ASTM specification contains
  two relevant fuel designations (Jet A and Jet A-1), which differ only in their
  freezing points. The DEF STAN specification addresses only Jet A-1. Jet A fuel
  has a maximum freezing point of -40°C and is used only in the United States,
  where moderate temperatures combined with short flight times justify a separate
  specification to increase availability. Jet A-1 has a maximum freezing-point
  requirement of -47°C to meet the low-temperature requirements of long, high-altitude
  flights and is used everywhere in the world except the United States. Other
  differences between these fuel specifications are relatively minor and immaterial
  to this report.</p>
<p>The ICAO specification for fuel to be used in emissions testing of aircraft
  gas turbines is also a kerosene-type fuel (ICAO, 1993). Restrictions are placed
  only on the 10 properties that potentially affect emissions. <a href="108.htm#tab79">Table
  7-9</a> compares the ICAO specification with the ASTM and DEF STAN specifications
  for the relevant properties. The property limits of ICAO are somewhat more restrictive
  than the commercial specifications to limit testing concerns, but at the expense
  of cost and availability. </p>
<p>Also shown in <a href="108.htm#tab79">Table 7-9</a> is the percentage of fuels
  sold in 1997 in the United Kingdom under DEF STAN 91-91 that meet the ICAO limits.
  Virtually all DEF STAN 91-91 fuels met the ICAO limits except for naphthalenes
  and hydrogen content; in both cases, the non-attainment fuels were to the side
  of lower emissions (i.e., lower naphthalenes and higher hydrogen). This comparison
  shows that the ICAO fuel specification for emissions testing is relevant to
  jet fuels being marketed. </p>
<p>The primary military fuels of North America and Western Europe are defined
  by the identical specifications F-34 (NATO) and JP-8 (United States). These
  specifications effectively define military fuels throughout much of the world
  because many countries buy their military aircraft from the same manufacturers.
  The only significant difference between these military fuels and Jet A-1 is
  the mandatory use of certain additives in the military fuels; however, some
  of these same additives may be found in some civilian fuels. For shipboard safety
  reasons, Navy aircraft use a high-flash-point kerosene fuel that is less volatile,
  but other relevant properties are similar; in Western Europe and North America,
  these fuels are designated as F-44 (NATO) and JP-5 (United States). For completeness,
  we mention here the existence of small volumes of special fuels used by military
  aircraft that fly at very high altitudes and/or require a higher thermal stability
  than conventional fuels provide. These fuels are also kerosene-type fuels but
  may have different volatility/freezing-point requirements and are more highly
  refined to improve thermal stability. <a name="tab710"></a></p>

<p>All jet fuels are composed primarily of hydrocarbons as a blend of saturates,
  with no more than 25% aromatics. Olefins may be present, but they are effectively
  kept below about 1% by stability requirements. Additionally, a fuel may contain
  up to 0.3% sulfur by weight, although the level is generally less than 0.1%.
  Certain additives may also be present, as mentioned previously. Trace levels
  of oxygenated organics (e.g., organic acids) may be present but are effectively
  limited in concentration by the fuel specification to ensure product stability
  and materials compatibility. Metal contaminants such as iron, copper, and zinc
  can be picked up from plumbing and storage systems and can be present in the
  low ppb range. Halogens are not an issue because they are not used in refinery
  processes for kerosene. Additives currently used in jet fuels are all organic
  compounds that may also contain a small fraction of sulfur or nitrogen. The
  maximum allowable concentrations of these additives is controlled by relevant
  fuel specifications. These concentrations vary with the additive but are less
  than 6 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (approximately 6 ppm), with the exception of two additives that
  contain no sulfur or nitrogen. Therefore, these additives presumably will have
  no measurable impact on emissions and are not an issue for this discussion (based
  on their constituents and very low concentrations); however, additional testing
  should be conducted to verify these conclusions. </p>
<p>In summary, differences between jet fuel specifications around the world are
  relatively minor and have little effect on fleet exhaust emissions. Thus, aviation
  fuel, in the context of this report, refers to all civilian and military jet
  fuels unless otherwise specified. </p>
