<h2>8.2. Air Traffic Management System-Present and Future </h2>
<h3><a name="821"></a>8.2.1. Introduction </h3>
<p>Demand for air travel is growing rapidly. Shortfalls in capacity and other
  constraints on the efficiency of airport and aircraft operations have negative
  effects on airline costs, passenger convenience, and the environment. Making
  efficient use of finite airspace and airport resources while ensuring high levels
  of safety is the primary mission of ATM which involves considerable coordination
  of planning and operations among regulators, service providers, and users at
  the global, regional, and national levels. </p>
<p>This section discusses the conventional ATM system in the context of operational
  phases of flight, highlighting constraints and limitations and the negative
  effects they have on airport and aircraft operations-including unnecessary fuel
  burn and, consequently, excessive emissions. The section then describes changes
  anticipated for the future based on new technologies and improved procedures
  that are expected to lead to the creation of a more efficient and integrated
  global ATM system. </p>
<p>Improved ATM as envisaged will encompass traditional elements of air traffic
  services (ATS)-air traffic control (ATC), air traffic flow management (ATFM),
  and airspace management (ASM)-but will also functionally integrate these elements
  with ATM-related aspects of flight operations into a total system. Today, ATC
  accounts for the greatest percentage of ATS on a global basis; ATC serves primarily
  to prevent collisions between aircraft and between aircraft and obstructions
  in the airport maneuvering area and to expedite and maintain an orderly flow
  of air traffic. For current (i.e., 1998-99), worldwide aircraft fleet operations,
  improvements to the ATM system alone could reduce fuel burn per trip by 6-12%
  (EUROCONTROL, 1997b; FAA, 1998a; ICAO, 1998b). </p>
<p>Improving ATM requires that advanced technological and management systems and
  procedures be adopted more rapidly and on a broader scale than is presently
  the case. Specific improvements related to ATM and the operation of aircraft
  that could reduce fuel burn are covered in this chapter; institutional, regulatory,
  and economic policy measures that could also have an important influence on
  future traffic growth and associated fuel burn are covered in <a href="148.htm">Chapter
  10</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="822"></a>8.2.2. Limitations of Current ATM System </h3>
<h4><a name="8221"></a>8.2.2.1. General </h4>
<p>In 1983, the ICAO Council established a committee to identify and assess new
  technologies and make recommendations for the future development of air navigation.
  After close analysis, the special committee on the future air navigation system
  (FANS) recognized that the existing air navigation system and its subsystems
  suffered from technical, operational, procedural, economic, and implementation
  shortcomings. In addition to infrastructure constraints, conventional airspace
  organization of flight information regions and their supporting infrastructure
  of routes and ground-based facilities and services are based largely on national
  rather than international requirements. For these reasons, aircraft must plan
  their flights along strictly defined routes and be channelled, to a certain
  degree, so that air traffic controllers can keep aircraft safely separated from
  each other. </p>
<h4><a name="8222"></a>8.2.2.2. Airport and Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) Operations
  and Capacity </h4>
<p>In some regions, limited airport capacity is one of the main constraints on
  continued growth in air transport; this limited capacity results in congestion
  and delays. There is also a lack of adequate awareness and shared decisionmaking
  among ATC, ramp, and taxi areas. In low-visibility conditions, movements are
  severely restricted, and there is increased risk of runway incursion. Insufficiently
  developed taxiways and aprons also limit runway and airport capacity. Operational
  limitations for noise control may also have a negative effect on access to and
  from key airports. Automated ground-based systems to manage departures and arrivals
  efficiently are not available in most cases, and onboard automation is therefore
  underutilized. Published arrival and departure procedures-created to ease controller
  workload and ensure separation between departures and arrivals-are often inflexible,
  indirect, and less than optimum. </p>
<h4><a name="8223"></a>8.2.2.3. En Route and Oceanic Operations </h4>
<p>The existing worldwide route structure often imposes mileage penalties compared
  to the most economic routes (generally great-circle routes); it also takes into
  account wind, temperature, and other factors such as aircraft weight, charges,
  and safety. Use of a fixed-route network often results in concentration of traffic
  flows at major intersections, which can lead to a reduction in the number of
  routes and flight levels that are available. Studies on penalties to air traffic
  associated with the European ATS Route Network alone suggest that ATM-related
  problems add an average of about 9-10% to the flight track distance of all European
  flights en route and in terminal maneuvering areas (TMA) (EUROCONTROL, 1992).
  Lack of international coordination in the development of ground ATC systems
  exacerbates these problems. Examples include inconsistent separation standards
  in radar and non-radar airspace and operation at less than optimum flight levels
  in oceanic airspace as a result of communication deficiencies. </p>
<h4><a name="8224"></a>8.2.2.4. Meteorological Information </h4>
<p>Currently, three main areas can be distinguished in which improvements need
  to be made in the way meteorological information is provided to international
  civil aviation: Timeliness, presentation, and accuracy. </p>
<p>Timeliness problems are largely related to the inability of telecommunications
  channels in some regions to cope with increasing message traffic. As a result,
  tight restrictions have been established concerning the exchange of operational
  meteorological information, which now does not fully meet flight planning requirements
  for increasingly long-range aircraft operations. The presentation of meteorological
  information has also been largely dictated by the telecommunications channels
  used, which have imposed a predominance of alphanumeric messages over graphical
  information, especially in the cockpit. </p>
<p>Finally, the accuracy of meteorological information needs improvement. For
  the en route phase of flight, the information provided is not always based on
  output from the most advanced numerical weather prediction models. In the terminal
  area, up-to-date and accurate meteorological information may not be available
  to the pilot because of congestion of voice channels and/or lack of modern observing
  systems. </p>
<h4><a name="8225"></a>8.2.2.5. Restricted and Military Airspace </h4>
<p>The fundamental premise that every state has complete and exclusive sovereignty
  over the airspace above its territory can be traced to the Convention on International
  Civil Aviation (ICAO, 1997). States implement restrictions on the use of airspace
  for a variety of reasons, including technological limitations, political considerations,
  security, and environmental concerns. However, by far the most important reason
  for restricted airspace is to accommodate the needs of states' military forces.
  Restricted airspace does not allow aircraft to minimize their emissions by direct
  routing between two points. Significant regions of airspace are permanently
  reserved or restricted, thereby forcing civil air transport to circumnavigate
  these areas. </p>
<p>The extent of the problem varies by region. In the European region, for example,
  24 states are applying the flexible use of airspace (FUA) concept (EUROCONTROL,
  1998a). The basis for FUA is that airspace should no longer be considered as
  either military or civil airspace but should be considered as a continuum, shared
  in accordance with user needs and used flexibly on a day-to-day basis. Although
  national security requirements must be key factors in revising a nation's restricted
  airspace allocation, problems related to restricted and military airspace could
  partly be solved by modernization of the ATM system. Negotiation of overflying
  rights to shorten routes would also contribute to solving the problems. </p>
