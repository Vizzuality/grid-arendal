<h3>6.2.2. Global Warming Potential</h3>
<p>Global warming potential (GWP; see Shine et al., 1990, for a formal definition)
  is an index that attempts to integrate the overall climate impacts of a specific
  action (e.g., emissions of CH<font size="-2">4</font>, NO<font size="-2">x</font>
  or aerosols). It relates the impact of emissions of a gas to that of emission
  of an equivalent mass of CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>. The duration of the perturbation
  is included by integrating radiative forcing over a time horizon (e.g., standard
  horizons for IPCC have been 20, 100, and 500 years). The time horizon thus includes
  the cumulative climate change and the decay of the perturbation. </p>
<p>GWP has provided a convenient measure for policymakers to compare the relative
  climate impacts of two different emissions. However, the basic definition of
  GWP has flaws that make its use questionable, in particular, for aircraft emissions.
  For example, impacts such as contrails may not be directly related to emissions
  of a particular greenhouse gas. Also, indirect RF from O<font size="-2">3</font>
  produced by NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions is not linearly proportional to the amount of NO<font size="-2">x</font>
  emitted but depends also on location and season. Essentially, the buildup and
  radiative impact of short-lived gases and aerosols will depend on the location
  and even the timing of their emissions. Furthermore, the GWP does not account
  for an evolving atmosphere wherein the RF from a 1-ppm increase in CO<span class="subscript">2</span> is larger
  today than in 2050 and the efficiency of NO<font size="-2">x</font> at producing
  tropospheric O<font size="-2">3</font> depends on concurrent pollution of the
  troposphere. </p>
<p>In summary, GWPs were meant to compare emissions of long-lived, well-mixed
  gases such as CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>, CH<font size="-2">4</font>, N<font size="-2">2</font>O,
  and hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) for the current atmosphere; they are not adequate
  to describe the climate impacts of aviation. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, some researchers have calculated a GWP, or modified version,
  for aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions via induced ozone perturbation (e.g., Michaelis,
  1993; Fuglestvedt et al., 1996; Johnson and Derwent, 1996; Wuebbles, 1996).
  The results vary widely as a result of model differences, varying scenarios
  for NO<font size="-2">x</font> emission, and the ambiguous GWP definition for
  short-lived gases. There is a basic impossibility of defining a GWP for "aircraft
  NO<font size="-2">x</font>" because emissions during takeoff and landing would
  have one GWP; those at cruise, another; those in polar winter, another; and
  those in the upper tropical troposphere, yet another. Different chemical regimes
  will produce different amounts of ozone for the same injection of NO<font size="-2">x</font>,
  and the radiative forcing of that ozone perturbation will vary by location (Fuglesvedt
  et al., 1999). In view of all these problems, we will not attempt to derive
  GWP indices for aircraft emissions in this study. The history of radiative forcing,
  calculated for the changing atmosphere, is a far better index of anthropogenic
  climate change from different gases and aerosols than is GWP. </p>

<h3>6.2.3. Alternative Indexing of Aviation's Climate Impact-RF Index <a name="623"></a></h3>
<p>A new alternative index to measure the role of aviation in climate change is
  introduced here: the radiative forcing index (RFI), which is defined as the
  ratio of total radiative forcing to that from CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font> emissions
  alone. Total radiative forcing induced by aircraft is the sum of all forcings,
  including direct emissions (e.g., CO<span class="subscript">2</span><font size="-2"></font>, soot) and indirect
  atmospheric responses (e.g., CH<font size="-2">4</font>, O<font size="-2">3</font>,
  sulfate, contrails). RFI is a measure of the importance of aircraft-induced
  climate change other than that from the release of fossil carbon alone. RFI
  ranges between 2.2 and 3.4 for the various E- and F-type scenarios for subsonic
  aviation and technical options considered here (see <a href="083.htm">Section
  6.6</a>). Thus, aircraft-induced climate change with RFI > 1 highlights the
  need for a thorough climate assessment of this sector as performed here. For
  comparison, in the IS92a scenario the RFI for all human activities is about
  1; for greenhouse gases alone, it is about 1.5, and it is even higher for sectors
  that emit CH<font size="-1">4</font> and N<font size="-2">2</font>O without
  significant fossil fuel use.</p>
