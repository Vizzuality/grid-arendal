<h3>6.1.1. Anthropogenic Climate Change, Variability, and Detection</h3>
<p>What is climate change? The common definition of climate refers to the average
  of weather, yet the definition of the climate system must reach out to the broader
  geophysical system that interacts with the atmosphere and our weather. The concept
  of climate change has acquired a number of different meanings in the scientific
  literature and in the media. Often, "climate change" denotes variations resulting
  from human interference, and "climate variability" refers to natural variations.
  Sometimes "climate change" designates variations longer than a certain period.
  Finally, "climate change" is often taken to mean climate fluctuations of a global
  nature, including effects from human activities such as the enhanced greenhouse
  effect and from natural causes such as volcanic aerosols.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the UNFCCC (and this report), the definition of climate
  change is: "A change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to
  human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which
  is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time
  periods." This alteration of the global atmosphere includes changes in land
  use as well as anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and particles. This
  FCCC definition thus introduces the concept of the difference between the effect
  of human activities (climate change) and climatic effects that would occur without
  such human interference (climate variability).</p>

<p>What drives changes in climate? The Earth absorbs radiation from the sun, mainly
  at the surface. This energy is then redistributed by atmospheric and oceanic
  circulations and radiated to space at longer ("terrestrial" or "infrared") wavelengths.
  On average, for the Earth as a whole, incoming solar energy is balanced by outgoing
  terrestrial radiation. Any factor that alters radiation received from the sun
  or lost to space or the redistribution of energy within the atmosphere and between
  atmosphere, land, and ocean can affect climate. A change in radiative energy
  available to the global Earth/atmosphere system is termed here, as in previous
  IPCC reports, radiative forcing (see <a href="070.htm">Section 6.2</a> for more
  details). Radiative forcing (RF) is the global, annual average of radiative
  imbalance (W m<font size="-1">-2</font>) in net heating of the Earth's lower
  atmosphere as a result of human activities since the beginning of the industrial
  era almost 2 centuries ago. </p>
<p>Increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases reduce the efficiency with
  which the surface of the Earth radiates heat to space: More outgoing terrestrial
  radiation from the surface is absorbed by the atmosphere and is emitted at higher
  altitudes and colder temperatures. This process results in positive radiative
  forcing, which tends to warm the lower atmosphere and the surface. This radiative
  forcing is the enhanced greenhouse effect-an enhancement of an effect that has
  operated in the Earth's atmosphere for billions of years as a result of naturally
  occurring greenhouse gases (i.e., water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane,
  and nitrous oxide). The amount of warming depends on the size of the increase
  in concentration of each greenhouse gas, the radiative properties of the gases
  involved, their geographical and vertical distribution, and the concentrations
  of other greenhouse gases already present in the atmosphere. </p>
<p>Anthropogenic aerosols (small particles and droplets) in the troposphere-derived
  mainly from the emission of sulfur dioxide from fossil fuel burning but also
  from biomass burning and aircraft-can absorb and reflect solar radiation. In
  addition, changes in aerosol concentrations may alter cloud amount and cloud
  reflectivity through their effect on cloud microphysical properties. Often,
  tropospheric aerosols tend to produce negative radiative forcing and thus to
  cool climate. They have a much shorter lifetime (days to weeks) than most greenhouse
  gases (which have lifetimes of decades to centuries), so their concentrations
  respond much more quickly to changes in emissions. </p>
<p>Other natural changes, such as major volcanic eruptions that produce extensive
  stratospheric aerosols or variations in the sun's energy output, also drive
  climate variation by altering the radiative balance of the planet. On time scales
  of tens of thousands of years, slow variations in the Earth's orbit, which are
  well understood, have led to changes in the seasonal and latitudinal distribution
  of solar radiation; these changes have played an important part in controlling
  variations of climate in the distant past, such as glacial cycles. </p>
<p>Any changes in the radiative balance of the Earth, including those resulting
  from an increase in greenhouse gases or aerosols, will tend to alter atmospheric
  and oceanic temperatures and associated circulation and weather patterns. These
  effects will be accompanied by changes in the hydrological cycle (for example,
  altered cloud distributions or changes in rainfall and evaporation regimes).
  Any human-induced changes in climate will also alter climatic variability that
  otherwise would have occurred. Such variability contains a wide range of space
  and time scales. Climate variations can also occur in the absence of a change
  in external forcing, as a result of complex interactions between components
  of the climate system such as the atmosphere and ocean. The El Niï¿½o-Southern
  Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is a prominent example of such natural "internal"
  variability. </p>
<p>In the observationally based record of global mean surface temperatures shown 
  by the black line on <a href="066.htm#img62">Figure 6-2</a>, both interannual 
  variability and a positive trend are apparent. Year-to-year variations can be 
  interpreted as resulting from internal variability; and the trend, as caused 
  by external forcing mechanisms. For comparison, the yellow line on <a href="066.htm#img62">Figure 
  6-2</a> shows a control run from a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation 
  model in which concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols are held fixed: 
  This indicates that observed natural variability in global mean surface temperatures 
  may be adequately simulated. The red and the blue lines in <a href="066.htm#img62">Figure 
  6-2</a> show the surface temperature simulated by two different general circulation 
  models driven by increased greenhouse gas and sulfate aerosol concentrations. 
  Both of the models simulate interannual variability and trends in surface temperature, 
  but differences in model sensitivities (see <a href="070.htm">Section 6.2</a>) 
  lead to differing temperature trends. <a href="066.htm#img62">Figure 6-2</a> 
  also shows that estimates of the global mean temperature trend resulting from 
  increased greenhouse gas concentrations alone (green line) leads to a larger 
  temperature change than observed. </p>
<p>It is difficult to ascribe climate change to human activities and even harder
  to identify a particular change with a specific activity. The point at which
  change is detected in a climate variable is the point at which the observed
  global mean trend (signal) unambiguously rises above background natural climate
  variability (noise). Good observational records of climate and sufficiently
  accurate, reliable models are needed. To simulate climate change, the models
  require complete representation of all anthropogenic forcing mechanisms (i.e.,
  changes in atmospheric composition). In practice, current climate change is
  just comparable to natural variability. Therefore, more sophisticated tools
  have been developed that use the spatial structure of specific climate variables
  expected to change, which is known as the "fingerprint" method of detection
  (e.g., Hasselmann, 1993; Santer et al., 1996).</p>
