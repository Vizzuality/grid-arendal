<H2><b>1.3. Emissions and the Environment</b></H2>
<p>The global environmental issues addressed in this report are climate changes
  and depletion of stratospheric ozone (see Boxes <a href="014.htm#box11">1-1</a>
  and <a href="014.htm#box12">1-2</a>). Major international assessments of these
  issues are made periodically, and no attempt is made here to revisit such reports
  (for more information, see IPCC, 1996a,b; WMO, 1999, and references therein).
  These reports are used for contextual information and as a background to the
  possible impact of aviation on the atmosphere. There have also been several
  recent assessments of the impacts of aviation in Europe and the United States
  of America (Stolarski et al., 1995; Friedl et al., 1997; Schumann et al., 1997;
  Brasseur et al., 1998). </p>
<p>Aviation represents only one of many perturbations associated with future scenarios.
  There are many sources of climate-active substances. For example, greenhouse
  gases are emitted from a wide range of industrial, domestic, and agricultural
  activities, and there are numerous sources of aerosols (e.g., sulfate from fossil
  fuel combustion and volcanoes and carbonaceous aerosols from fossil fuel and
  biomass burning). Increases in tropospheric ozone are expected to result from
  increasing methane, nitrogen oxides, carbon moNO<span class="subscript">x</span>ide, and hydrocarbon emissions.
  Similarly, perturbations to stratospheric ozone result from chlorofluorocarbons
  (CFCs) and CFC-substitutes and from halon and methyl bromide emissions in addition
  to any potential perturbations resulting from aircraft emissions. </p>
<p>Some of the processes related to aviation emissions and their location in the
  atmosphere are shown in <a href="015.htm#img02">Figure 1-2</a>. Subsonic aircraft
  fly in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, whereas supersonic aircraft fly
  in the stratosphere 80-85% of the time, with cruise altitudes several kilometers
  above those of subsonic aircraft. The differing chemical and physical processes
  in the two regions must be taken into account. </p>
<p>The troposphere is principally heated near the Earth's surface, and the temperature
  decreases with altitude. Warm, moist air tends to underlie cool, dry air, leading
  to frequent vertical turbulent motions that exchange air throughout this region.
  In contrast, the temperature in the stratosphere generally increases with altitude;
  the result, as reflected in its name, is that this region is stratified. Vertical
  motions are much slower here than in the troposphere. The stratosphere is also
  much drier than the troposphere, and clouds rarely form at this level. </p>
<p>Table 1-1 lists aircraft emissions that are important from an atmospheric perspective,
  with summaries of the roles that they play. These emissions can be usefully
  divided into two categories, depending on how they affect climate: Direct, as
  with CO<span class="subscript">2</span> (where the emitted compound is the species that can modify climate),
  and indirect, where the climate species is not the same as the emitted species-as
  with modified cirrus cloud coverage resulting from particles and particle precursors.
</p>
<h3><b><a name="131"></a>1.3.1. Carbon Dioxide </b></h3>
<p>The behavior of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> within the atmosphere is simple and well understood. There
  are no important formation or destruction processes that take place in the atmosphere
  itself. Atmospheric sources and sinks occur principally at the Earth's surface
  and involve exchanges with the biosphere and the oceans (e.g., Schimel et al.,
  1995, 1996). The effect of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> on climate change is direct and depends simply
  on its atmospheric concentration. CO<span class="subscript">2</span> molecules absorb outgoing infrared radiation
  emitted by the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. The observed 25-30% increase
  in atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentrations over the past 200 years has caused a warming
  of the troposphere and a cooling of the stratosphere. </p>
<p>There has been much discussion about how stabilization of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentrations
  might be achieved in the future (e.g., IPCC, 1996a, 1997a,b). One of the most
  important factors is the accumulated emission between now and the time at which
  stabilization is reached. The way in which annual emissions vary over time is
  less important. Two findings from these IPCC reports are worth noting:</p>
<ul>
  <p>If global anthropogenic CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions were maintained near 1994 levels, the
    atmospheric concentration would continue to rise for more than 200 years;
    by the end of the 21st century, it would have reached about 500 ppmv (compared
    to its pre-industrial value of 280 ppmv).<br>
    A range of carbon cycle models indicates that stabilization of atmospheric
    CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentrations at 450, 650, or 1000 ppmv could be achieved only if global
    anthropogenic CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions drop to 1990 levels by approximately 40, 140,
    or 240 years from now, respectively, and substantially below 1990 levels subsequently.
  </p>

<p>The amount of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> formed from the combustion of aircraft fuel is determined
  by the total amount of carbon in the fuel because CO<span class="subscript">2</span> is an unavoidable end
  product of the combustion process (as is water). The subsequent transport and
  processing of this CO<span class="subscript">2</span> in the atmosphere follows the same pathways as those
  of other CO<span class="subscript">2</span> molecules emitted into the atmosphere from whatever source. Thus,
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emitted from aircraft becomes well mixed and indistinguishable from CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  from other fossil fuel sources, and the effects on climate are the same. The
  rate of growth in aviation CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emission is faster than the underlying global
  rate of economic growth, so aviation's contribution, along with those of other
  forms of transportation, to total emissions resulting from human activities
  is likely to grow in coming years. The radiative and climate implications are
  addressed in <a href="063.htm">Chapter 6</a>. </p>
<h3><b><a name="132"></a>1.3.2. Water</b></h3>
<p>The natural cycle of water in the atmosphere is also complex, involving a suite
  of closely coupled physical processes. This is particularly true in the troposphere,
  where there is continual cycling between water vapor, clouds, precipitation,
  and ground water. Water vapor and clouds have large radiative effects on climate
  and directly influence tropospheric chemistry. The stratosphere is much drier
  than the troposphere. Nevertheless, water vapor is important in determining
  radiative balance and chemical composition, most dramatically in polar ozone
  loss through the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). </p>
<p>Emissions of water vapor by the global aircraft fleet into the troposphere
  are small compared with fluxes within the natural hydrological cycle; however,
  the effects of contrails and enhanced cirrus formation must be considered (<a href="031.htm">Chapter
  3</a>). Water vapor resides in the troposphere for about 9 days. In the stratosphere,
  the time scale for removal of any aircraft water emissions is longer (months
  to years) than in the troposphere, and there is a greater chance for aircraft
  emissions to increase the ambient concentration. Any such increase could have
  two effects: A direct radiative effect with a consequent influence on climate,
  and a chemical perturbation of stratospheric ozone both directly and through
  the potentially increased occurrence of polar stratospheric clouds at high latitudes.
  The implication of releases in the stratosphere are discussed in <a href="044.htm">Chapters
  4</a> and <a href="063.htm">6</a>. </p>
<h3><b><a name="133"></a>1.3.3. Nitrogen Oxides</b></h3>
<p>Nitrogen oxides (NO and NO<span class="subscript">2</span> are jointly referred to as NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) are present throughout
  the atmosphere. They are very influential in the chemistry of the troposphere
  and the stratosphere, and they are important in ozone production and destruction
  processes. There are a number of sources (oxidation of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O, lightning, fossil
  fuel combustion) whose contribution to NO<span class="subscript">x</span> concentrations in the upper troposphere
  are not well quantified. </p>
<p>In all regions, the chemistry of the atmosphere is complex; aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  are best viewed as perturbing a web of chemical reactions with a resultant impact
  on ozone concentrations that differs with location, season, and so forth. In
  the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions tend to
  cause increased ozone amounts, so increased ozone and its greenhouse effects
  are the main issues for NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from subsonic aircraft. The pathways of
  other atmospheric constituents are also affected. Principal among these effects
  for NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions is the reduction in the atmospheric lifetime and concentration
  of methane, another greenhouse gas. On the other hand, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions at the
  higher altitudes (18 km or above) of supersonic aircraft tend to deplete ozone.
  These and other issues related to the atmospheric chemistry of aviation emissions
  are discussed in <a href="020.htm">Chapters 2 (past and present)</a> and <a href="044.htm">4
  (future)</a>. The effects on ultraviolet fluxes at the Earth's surface are discussed
  in <a href="054.htm">Chapter 5</a>. </p>
<h3><b><a name="134"></a>1.3.4. Particles and Particle Precursors </b></h3>
<p>A similarly complex system of atmospheric processes and effects exists for
  particles. There are many types of particles, each with its own complex physics
  and chemistry. Natural types of particles include salt particles from sea spray,
  wind-blown soil, and sulfate aerosols produced from naturally emitted sulfur-containing
  gases. Aerosols resulting from human activities include sulfate aerosols and
  soot from fossil fuel burning. Carbonaceous aerosols are produced from biomass
  burning and fossil fuel burning. </p>
<p>Particles related to aviation (principally sulfate aerosols and soot particles)
  are discussed in <a href="031.htm">Chapter 3</a> together with contrail and
  cloud formation. Aircraft engines actually emit a mixture of particles (including
  metal particles and chemi-ions) and gases (e.g., SO<span class="subscript">2</span>). These emissions evolve
  in the engine exhaust and the atmosphere to form a variety of particles mainly
  composed of soot from incomplete combustion and sulfuric acid (H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>) from sulfur
  in the aviation fuel. These particles are capable of seeding contrails and cirrus
  clouds, thus potentially changing the total cloud cover in the upper troposphere.
  The climate impact of clouds is a balance of their capabilities to reflect sunlight
  back to space and to trap outgoing infrared radiation from the Earth's surface.
  For high clouds, the latter effect is larger, and increased cirrus coverage
  would result in a warming tendency. (This effect is opposite in sign to that
  of surface emissions of SO<span class="subscript">2</span>, which mainly affect low-altitude clouds and produce
  a cooling effect.) </p>
<p>Particles are also involved in the chemical balance of the atmosphere. It is
  well established that the sulfate aerosol layer in the stratosphere is critically
  important in determining the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> budget there; any long-term changes in the
  surface area of particles would affect stratospheric NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, hence ozone. The chemical
  issues related to particles are discussed in <a href="020.htm">Chapters 2</a>
  and <a href="044.htm">4</a>. </p>
<h3><b><a name="135"></a>1.3.5. Atmospheric Models</b></h3>
<p>Atmospheric models attempt to describe the workings of the atmosphere; the
  detail of the description depends on factors such as the scientific understanding
  of the processes involved, the time scale of interest, and the available computer
  resources. Different models include different facets of the atmosphere system.
  For instance, state-of-the-art climate models are similar to weather prediction
  models, but additionally may include descriptions of the ocean and the biosphere
  so that the exchange of heat and carbon dioxide can be modeled. The next generation
  of models is likely to include chemical processes and be derived from the current
  generation of models that contain detailed descriptions of the chemistry. </p>
<p>A wide range of different types of atmospheric models are used within this
  report, depending on the problem of interest. Chemical transport models are
  used to calculate changes in chemical composition resulting from aviation emissions
  (<a href="020.htm">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="044.htm">4</a>); microphysical
  models are used to calculate changes in particle composition (<a href="031.htm">Chapter
  3</a>), and radiative transfer and climate models are used to assess the possible
  impact on UV-B radiation (<a href="054.htm">Chapter 5</a>) and climate (<a href="063.htm">Chapter
  6</a>). Model uncertainties arise from one of two main sources: Incorrect or
  poorly quantified descriptions of the processes involved, and missing processes.
  These uncertainties are typically reduced over time as the state of the underlying
  scientific knowledge evolves. Although it is difficult to quantify these uncertainties,
  one of the major aims of this report is to give a clear idea of the uncertainties
  associated with model calculations. </p>
