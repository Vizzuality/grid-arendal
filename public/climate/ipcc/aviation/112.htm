<h2> 7.9. Small Aircraft, Engines, and APUs </h2>
<p>Small aircraft engines are defined here as all turbo engines-excluding piston
  engines because of the very small amount of fuel burned by these engines (much
  less than 5% of the world's fleet fuel burn; see <a href="091.htm">Section 7.2</a>)-that
  are used for regional aircraft, all turbofans with less than 89 kN thrust, all
  turboprop and turboshaft engines, and all auxiliary power units (APUs) used
  in civil aircraft. </p>
<p>The small commercial and general aviation segment has been growing rapidly
  in recent years and is likely to continue to do so. This segment's impact on
  the environment, however, is unlikely to be significant because of low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions
  levels associated with the generally lower pressure ratio engines they employ
  and the decreasing percentage of the fleet's fuel burn they represent (see <a href="130.htm">Chapter
  9</a>). Furthermore, most of aircraft in this sector fly short missions with
  lower cruise altitudes and reduced potential for climatic impact. Significant
  improvements have been made in the idle emissions of small engines in recent
  years, so that CO, HC, and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions from small regional and general aviation
  aircraft are often comparable, in terms of emissions per kilogram of fuel burned,
  to those from large engines (Eatock and Sampath, 1993). </p>
<p>This section highlights the key differences between large and small engines
  in terms of emissions characteristics and control technologies that might apply
  to small aircraft and engines. A brief overview is presented on small airframe
  technology, engine performance, engine emission databases, combustor technology,
  and unique issues related to small engine combustors. </p>

<p>The airframe technology applicable to small aircraft parallels that of large
  aircraft discussed in <a href="093.htm">Section 7.3</a>. Designers and manufacturers
  continue to strive to reduce drag and increase range/payload performance with
  a resultant steady improvement in overall fuel-efficiency of new small aircraft.
  Propeller design, of course, is of much greater importance to this sector of
  the world's fleets. Detailed aerodynamics research is showing some of the significant
  performance benefits-thus fuel savings-that can be achieved from relatively
  small changes in the design of small airframes. </p>
<p>Nacelle problems associated with higher bypass ratio engines for small aircraft
  are similar to those of large aircraft. Although embedded engines have been
  considered, there are no plans to adopt them because the small gains in nacelle
  efficiency are more than offset by losses in wing efficiency. </p>
<h3>7.9.2. Aircraft Weight Reduction<a name="792"></a></h3>
In general, simple scale effects mean that reductions in the size and weight of
an aircraft's structure and systems have a somewhat greater impact on small aircraft
than their larger counterparts. Thus, advances in the power, compactness, and
weight of avionics systems are important, as are potential benefits from newer
designs of system controls and valves. Ever-increasing uses of composites-not
only as aerodynamic fairings but also in the primary structure-are clearly important,
for the same reasons.
<p>Underpinning many of these issues is the emergence of a more centrally computerized
  product definition database introduced at an early stage in the aircraft/system
  definition process. This database greatly enhances the design, placement, and
  routing of environmental control system, hydraulic, fuel, and electrical systems
  and components. </p>
<h3><a name="793"></a>7.9.3. Engine Performance</h3>
<p>Existing small engines operate at overall peak pressure ratios from 8 to about
  30, as compared with large engine values (see <a href="095.htm">Section 7.4</a>) of about 20 to >
  40. Thus, NO<span class="subscript">x</span> production in grams per kilogram of fuel is typically lower for
  engines designed for regional and general aviation aircraft than it is even
  for future staged, low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> combustors in large engines. However, the low engine
  cycle pressure ratio makes efficient operation at idle intrinsically more difficult.
  Combustor inlet pressure at idle power may be less than half that of a modern
  large engine, with a resulting tendency to cause higher CO and HC emissions.
  However, technology advances in larger engines are reflected in the latest generation
  of small engines, with SFC improvements stemming from advanced combustor cooling
  techniques, high temperature materials, and advanced engine cycles with higher
  pressures and temperatures. Higher combustor inlet pressures and temperatures
  in modern small engine combustors now result in even lower fuel burn, which
  generally balances any tendency toward an increase in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> output. </p>
<h3><a name="794"></a>7.9.4. Engine Database</h3>
<p>Emissions for small turbofan engines with a thrust of more than 26.7 kN thrust
  are measured, reported, and certified in exactly the same manner as emissions
  for large engines and are recorded in the ICAO database (see <a href="107.htm#771">Section
  7.7.1</a>). Engine manufacturers usually have some emissions data on their non-certified
  engines (turbo-shafts, turboprops, APUs, and turbofans of less than 26.7 kN
  thrust), but in general these engines are not of certification quality and the
  data are not readily available. The ICAO LTO cycle is used for turbofan engines,
  but these points are not well defined for turboshaft or turboprop engines because
  their thrust depends on the propeller or rotor selected for each application.
  Shaft power is usually substituted for thrust in emissions calculations to compare
  turboshaft or turboprop engines, but these emissions cannot be compared directly
  with turbofan data (which is based on thrust). </p>
<p>Correlations between measured emissions at static sea level conditions and
  altitude operating conditions, as discussed in <a href="108.htm">Section 7.7.2</a>,
  are generally applicable to small engines. Exceptions may occur for very small
  engines in which combustor surface to volume ratios, fuel atomization quality,
  combustor volumes, and so forth are very different from those in large engines.
  Small engines may require additional correlation parameters to account for these
  differences (Rizk, 1994). </p>

<p>The ability of gas turbine manufacturers to design successful small engine
  combustors with reduced emissions has improved greatly in the past 20 years.
  Idle efficiency data, indicative of CO and HC levels, collected by the General
  Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) (Eatock, 1993) and plotted in <a href="111.htm#img739">Figure
  7-39</a> indicate combustion inefficiencies at idle power of between 5 and 15%
  in early combustors. The trend, however, shows that modern small engines approach
  and even match the idle combustion efficiency of modern large turbofan engines.
  <a href="111.htm#img740">Figure 7-40</a> shows the basic "Lipfert" correlation
  (ERAA, 1992; Eatock and Sampath, 1993) of EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) in grams of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> per kilogram
  of fuel burned. The correlation relates emission indices of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> to compressor
  discharge pressure (pressure ratio) and covers most engines operating at or
  near stoichiometric burning at full-power condition. Many small aircraft engines
  have even lower EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) than those anticipated for the future third generation
  of large turbofan engines. </p>
<h4><a name="7952"></a>7.9.5.2. Unique Combustors for Small Engines</h4>
<p>The major challenge to reduce the emission level of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> for small engines is
  overcoming size-related constraints. NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reduction strategies may be restricted,
  for example, by the smaller passage height between the inner and outer diameters
  of the combustor, which limits the size and number of fuel injectors that can
  be used for such purposes. Small combustors are also more sensitive to minor
  size variations within fixed manufacturing tolerances. For these reasons, and
  to ensure that all such combustors will meet a given emissions goal, "nominal
  design" hardware must be able to demonstrate compliance with somewhat larger
  emissions margins than for larger engines. Many smaller engines use centrifugal
  compressors in combination with reverse-flow combustors. These combustors have
  a higher surface-to-volume ratio.Furthermore, scaling down a design has the
  effect of rapidly increasing combustor surface area-to-volume ratio (ICCAIA,
  1993). Both factors tend to result in the need for a higher percentage of combustor
  airflow for cooling the combustor, leaving a smaller amount of air available
  for controlling emissions. Together these effects limit the direct translation
  of low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> combustor technology from large engines into smaller combustion system
  designs. The NASA-sponsored contract for small turbofan engines (Bruce et al.,
  1977, 1978, 1981) demonstrated the problems very clearly. This work showed that
  even a modest 30% reduction in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> could be achieved only using a design that
  featured variable geometry and staged combustion, with a totally impractical
  increase in the number of fuel injectors. </p>
<h4><a name="7953"></a>7.9.5.3. Current and Future Trends</h4>
<p>In recent years, manufacturers of small engines have continued to develop new
  emissions control techniques that have minimum cost and performance impact.
  These techniques include combustors with optimized stoichiometry in the primary
  combustion zone, improved fuel/air mixing using efficient swirlers, improved
  fuel spray quality using piloted air-blast and aerating fuel nozzles, and combustors
  with optimized liner wall cooling to minimize wall quenching effects on CO and
  HC emissions. </p>
<p>Several advanced emission control concepts have also been investigated on small
  engines, including variable geometry and staged combustors (Bruce et al., 1977,
  1978, 1981). Variable geometry concepts can reduce HC and CO emissions; however,
  such complexity is particularly unattractive for small engines. An axially staged
  combustor requires a large number of fuel nozzles, with corresponding fuel passage
  size reduction and added fuel control system complexity. </p>
<p>In summary, small engine combustor technology has progressed markedly, especially
  in the past 20 years. In the short term, existing combustion chambers can be
  modified and optimized, within the constraints defined in <a href="112.htm#7952">Section
  7.9.5.2</a>, to obtain the best NO<span class="subscript">x</span> versus CO and HC compromise. There are no
  special fuel requirements for small engines and aircraft, now or in the foreseeable
  future.</p>
