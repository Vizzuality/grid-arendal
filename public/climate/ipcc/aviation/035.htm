<h3><b>3.2.3. Soot and Metal Particles </b></h3>
<h4><i><a name="3231"></a>3.2.3.1. Soot</i></h4>
<p>Aircraft jet engines directly emit solid soot particles. Soot encompasses all
  primary, carbon-containing products from incomplete combustion processes in
  the engine. Besides the pure (optically black) carbon fraction, these products
  may also contain nonvolatile (gray) organic compounds (e.g., Burtscher, 1992;
  Bockhorn, 1994). Soot parameters of importance for understanding plume processes
  are concentration and size distribution at the engine exit, nucleating and chemical
  properties, and freezing ability. </p>
<p>Soot emissions for current aircraft engines are specified under the International
  Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) using smoke number measurements (<a href="088.htm">Chapter
  7</a>). The smoke number is dominated by the largest soot particles collected
  onto a filter. Sampling soot particles smaller than about 300 nm on such filters
  becomes inefficient. Correlations between smoke number and soot mass concentrations
  (e.g., Champagne, 1988) are used to estimate the soot mass EI from ICAO certification
  data. A mean value has been estimated to be approximately 0.04 g/kg fuel for
  the present fleet (D�pelheuer, 1997). Because soot emissions depend strongly
  on engine types, power settings, and flight levels, additional information is
  generally needed to relate smoke number to emissions under flight conditions.
  However, details of the size distribution and physicochemical properties of
  soot under flight conditions are generally not known and cannot be inferred
  from smoke number data. Soot particle measurements for a variety of contemporary
  engines show values that scatter around 1015/kg fuel (<a href="034.htm#img33">Figure
  3-3b</a>). Thus, soot is about 100 times less abundant in the plume than volatile
  aerosol particles; no significant, if any, dependence exists between soot and
  fuel sulfur content (Petzold et al., 1997, 1999; Anderson et al., 1998a; Paladino
  et al., 1998). Values of 1014 to 1015/kg fuel are consistent with a mass range
  of 0.01 to 0.2 g/kg fuel for individual engines using estimated size distributions.
  The older Concorde and T-38 engines show exceptionally high number EIs, whereas
  one modern subsonic engine emits much fewer soot particles (about 1013/kg fuel)
  (Howard et al., 1996). Soot particles are composed of individual, nearly spherical
  particles (spherules), which have a number mean radius between 10 and 30 nm
  and exceed the size of volatile aerosol particles in a young plume (Hagen et
  al., 1992; Rickey, 1995) (<a href="034.htm#img32">Figure 3-2</a>). Several spherical
  soot particles may aggregate and form a complex chain structure that may change
  with time (Goldberg, 1985). The smallest soot particles will be most rapidly
  immersed in background aerosol droplets by coagulation, consistent with the
  fact that only larger individual soot particles or agglomerates with radii larger
  than about 50 to 100 nm are observable at cruising levels (Sheridan et al.,
  1994). Reported estimates of soot surface area at the engine exit are in the
  range of 5,000 to 105 �m<sup>2</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> (Rickey, 1995; Petzold et al., 1999). These values
  continually decrease as the plume dilutes. </p>
<p>Much less information is available concerning the hydration properties of exhaust
  soot. In the initial stages of formation, graphite-like soot particles are hydrophobic.
  However, laboratory observations have shown that n-hexane soot particles and
  other black carbons are partially hydrated (e.g., Chughtai et al., 1996). Soot
  particles fresh from jet engines very likely become hydrophilic by oxidation
  processes or deposition of water-soluble species present in the exhaust. Irregular
  surface features and chemically active sites can also increase chemical reactivity
  and amplify heterogeneous nucleation processes. </p>
<p>A clear correlation between fuel sulfur content and soluble mass fractions
  found on fresh exhaust soot suggests that soot hydrates more effectively with
  increasing EI(S) and that H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> is the primary soluble constituent (Whitefield
  et al., 1993). Hydration of carbon particles was observed under water-subsaturated
  conditions after treatment with gaseous H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> (Wyslouzil et al., 1994). This
  increase in H<span class="subscript">2</span>O adsorption is in qualitative agreement with an analysis of the
  wetting behavior of graphitic carbon under plume conditions (K�rcher et al.,
  1996b). Heterogeneous nucleation of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> hydrates on soot was found to be unlikely
  under plume conditions. Soot hydration properties may also change after treatment
  with OH and ozone (K�rcher et al., 1996b; Kotzick et al., 1997). </p>
<p>Production of water-soluble material by the interaction of soot with SO<span class="subscript">2</span> is
  unlikely because the sticking probabilities of gaseous SO<span class="subscript">2</span> on amorphous carbon
  are too small (Andronache and Chameides, 1997; Rogaski et al., 1997). However,
  SO<span class="subscript">3</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span> might easily adsorb on soot prior to volatile particle formation
  and may explain measured soluble mass fractions on soot (K�rcher, 1998b). Sulfur
  may also become incorporated into soot already within the engines, possibly
  via S-containing hydrocarbons involved in soot formation (Petzold and Schr�der,
  1998). Scavenging of small volatile droplets constitutes another soot activation
  pathway (Zhao and Turco, 1995; Brown et al., 1996b; Schumann et al., 1996).
  The resulting liquid H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>/H<span class="subscript">2</span>O coating increases with plume age and may enhance
  the ice-forming ability of soot, which is only poorly known (<a href="035.htm#324">Section
  3.2.4</a>), or it may suppress reactions identified in the laboratory using
  dry soot surfaces (Gao et al., 1998). </p>
<h4><i><a name="3232"></a>3.2.3.2 Metal Particles </i></h4>
<p>Aircraft jet engines also directly emit metal particles. Their sources include
  engine erosion and the combustion of fuel containing trace metal impurities
  or metal particles that enter the exhaust with the fuel (<a href="088.htm">Chapter
  7</a>). Metal particles-comprising elements such as Al, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, and
  Ba-are estimated to be present at the parts per billion by volume (ppbv) level
  at nozzle exit planes (CIAP, 1975; Fordyce and Sheibley, 1975). The corresponding
  concentrations of 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> particles/kg fuel (assuming 1-mm radius; see below)
  are much smaller than for soot. Although metals have been found as residuals
  in cirrus and contrail ice particles (Chen et al., 1998; Petzold et al., 1998;
  Twohy and Gandrud, 1998), their number and associated mass are considered too
  small to affect the formation or properties of more abundant volatile and soot
  plume aerosol particles. </p>
<h3><b><a name="324"></a>3.2.4. Contrail and Ice Particle Formation </b></h3>
<h4><i><a name="3241"></a>3.2.4.1. Formation Conditions and Observations</i></h4>
<p>Contrails consist of ice particles that mainly nucleate on exhaust soot and 
  volatile plume aerosol particles. Contrail formation is caused by the increase 
  in relative humidity (RH) that occurs in the engine plume as a result of mixing 
  of warm and moist exhaust gases with colder and less humid ambient air (Schmidt, 
  1941; Appleman, 1953). The RH with respect to liquid water must reach 100% in 
  the young plume behind the aircraft for contrail formation to occur (H�hndorf, 
  1941; Appleman, 1953; Busen and Schumann, 1995; Jensen et al., 1998a). The thermodynamic 
  relation for formation depends on pressure, temperature, and RH at a given flight 
  level; fuel combustion properties in terms of the emission index of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O 
  and combustion heat; and overall efficiency h (Cumpsty, 1997). h, defined as 
  the fraction of fuel combustion heat that is used to propel the aircraft, can 
  be computed from engine and aircraft properties (Schumann, 1996a; see also <a href="041.htm">Section 
  3.7</a>). Only the fraction (1-h) of the combustion heat leaves the engine with 
  the exhaust gases. As the value of h increases, exhaust plume temperatures decrease 
  for a given concentration of emitted water vapor, hence contrails form at higher 
  ambient temperatures and over a larger range of altitudes in the atmosphere 
  (Schmidt, 1941). Several recent studies reported formation and visibility of 
  contrails at temperatures and humidities as predicted by thermodynamic theory 
  for a variety of aircraft and ambient conditions (Busen and Schumann, 1995; 
  Schumann, 1996b; Schumann et al., 1996; Jensen et al., 1998a; Petzold et al., 
  1998). These data are compiled in <a href="035.htm#img34">Figure 3-4</a>. The 
  mixing process in the expanding exhaust plume is close to isobaric, so the specific 
  excess enthalpy and water content of the plume decrease with a fixed ratio as 
  plume species dilute from engine exit to ambient values. Hence, plume conditions 
  follow straight "mixing lines" in a plot of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O 
  partial pressures versus temperature (Schmidt, 1941) (<a href="035.htm#img34">Figure 
  3-4</a>). The thermodynamic properties of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O 
  are such that the saturation pressures over liquid water and water-ice (solid 
  and dashed lines) increase exponentially with temperature. Therefore, within 
  the first second in the plume, the exhaust RH increases to a maximum, then decreases 
  to ambient values. The ambient temperature reaches threshold values for contrail 
  formation when the mixing lines touch the liquid saturation curve in <a href="035.htm#img34">Figure 
  3-4b</a>. Contrails persist when mixing-line endpoints fall between the liquid 
  and ice saturation pressures-that is, when the ambient atmosphere is ice-supersaturated. 
  Without ambient ice supersaturation, contrail ice crystals evaporate on time 
  scales of seconds to minutes. Short-lived contrails may also form without ambient 
  water vapor if ambient temperatures are sufficiently low. </p>

<p>Contrails become visible within roughly a wingspan distance behind the aircraft,
  implying that the ice particles form and grow large enough to become visible
  within the first tenths of a second of plume age. Ice size distributions peak
  typically at 0.5 to 1 �m number mean radius (<a href="034.htm#img32">Figure 3-2</a>).
  A lower limit concentration of about 104 cm<sup>-3</sup> of ice-forming particles in the
  plume (at plume ages between 0.1 and 0.3 s) is necessary for a contrail to have
  an optical depth above the visibility threshold (K�rcher et al., 1996b). These
  values and the corresponding mean radii of 1 �m of contrail ice particles are
  in agreement with in situ measurements in young plumes (Petzold et al., 1997).
  Initial ice particle number densities increase from 104 to 105 cm<sup>-3</sup> and mean
  radii decrease from 1 to 0.3 �m when the ambient temperature is lowered by 10
  K from a typical threshold value of 222 K (K�rcher et al., 1998a). Although
  aerosol and ice particle formation in a contrail are influenced by the fuel
  sulfur content (Andronache and Chameides, 1997, 1998), it has only a small (<
  0.4 K) impact on the threshold temperature for contrail formation (Busen and
  Schumann, 1995; Schumann et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Simulations of contrail formation further suggest that contrails would also
  form without soot and sulfur emissions by activation and freezing of background
  particles (Jensen et al., 1998b; K�rcher et al., 1998a). However, the resulting
  contrails would have fewer and larger particles. </p>
<p>Ice particle size spectra within and at the edge of young contrails systematically
  differ from each other (Petzold et al., 1997). Ambient aerosol may play a larger
  role in contrail regions that nucleate at the plume edges, where the ratio of
  ambient to soot particles is largest and when ambient temperatures are low (212
  K) (Jensen et al., 1998b). Ice particles may also nucleate on ambient droplets
  in the upwelling limbs of vortices and could contribute to contrail ice mass
  (Gierens and Str�m, 1998). Metal (and soot) particles have been found as inclusions
  in contrail ice particles larger than 2 to 3 �m in radius (Twohy and Gandrud,
  1998), but these particles are numerically unimportant compared with other plume
  particles. </p>
<p>Contrail ice crystals evaporate quickly when the ambient air is subsaturated
  with respect to ice, unless the particles are coated with other species such
  as HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> (Diehl and Mitra, 1998). Simulations suggest that a few monolayers of
  HNO<span class="subscript">3</span> may condense onto ice particle surfaces and form NAT particles in stratospheric
  contrails (K�rcher, 1996). These particles would be thermodynamically stable
  and longer lived and would cause a different chemical perturbation than would
  short-lived stratospheric contrails composed of water ice. However, the relevance
  of this effect on larger scales has not yet been studied because no parameterization
  of NAT particle nucleation in aircraft plumes exists for use in atmospheric
  models (<a href="044.htm">Chapter 4</a>). </p>
<h4><i><a name="3242"></a>3.2.4.2. Freezing of Contrail Particles</i></h4>
<p>In a young contrail, activated particles first grow to sizes > 0.1 �m by water
  uptake before many of them freeze homogeneously to form water-ice particles
  (K�rcher et al., 1995; Brown et al., 1997). The fraction of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>/H<span class="subscript">2</span>O droplets
  that freezes depends on the actual droplet composition, which affects the homogeneous
  freezing rate, the time evolution of H<span class="subscript">2</span>O supersaturation and temperature in
  the plume, and possible competition with heterogeneous freezing processes involving
  soot (see <a href="034.htm#img31">Figure 3-1</a>). </p>
<p>Pure water droplets freeze homogeneously (without the presence of a foreign
  substrate) at a rate that grows in proportion to droplet volume and becomes
  very large when the droplet is cooled to the homogeneous freezing limit near
  about -45�C (Pruppacher, 1995). Acidic solutions freeze at lower temperatures
  than pure water. Freezing is often induced heterogeneously by solid material
  immersed inside a droplet (immersion freezing) or in contact with its surface
  (contact freezing). Prediction of heterogeneous freezing rates requires detailed
  knowledge about the ice-forming properties of droplet inclusions (Pruppacher
  and Klett, 1997). If homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing processes are possible,
  the most efficient freezing mode takes up available H<span class="subscript">2</span>O and may prevent the
  growth of other particle modes. </p>

</table>
<p>When the ambient temperature is near the threshold value for contrail formation,
  models suggest that volatile aerosol particles take up only a little water and
  stay below the critical size (radii > 2 to 5 nm) required for growth and subsequent
  freezing (K�rcher et al., 1995). This critical size-hence freezing probability-depends
  on maximum supercooling reached in the expanding plume. Particle growth rates-hence
  freezing rates-are larger in cooler and more humid ambient air, so volatile
  particles may contribute considerably to ice crystal nucleation at temperatures
  below the contrail threshold value. This result is supported by observations
  of contrails and their microphysical properties for different fuel sulfur levels
  (Petzold et al., 1997) and environmental temperatures (Freudenthaler et al.,
  1996). Volatile particles grown on charged droplets are more easily activated
  than neutral mode droplets (compare in <a href="034.htm#img32">Figure 3-2</a>),
  therefore may play an enhanced role in contrail formation (Yu and Turco, 1998b).
  Ambient particles also contribute to ice crystal nucleation in the contrail
  (Twohy and Gandrud, 1998). </p>
<p>In contrail particle formation, heterogeneous freezing processes involving
  soot (see Figures <a href="avf3-1.htm">3-1</a> and <a href="avf3-5.htm">3-5</a>)
  compete with homogeneous freezing of volatile plume particles. Volatile droplets
  will be prevented from freezing if rapid freezing of soot-containing particles
  occurs. Although this analysis is supported by model simulations and some observations
  (Gierens and Schumann, 1996; K�rcher et al., 1996b, 1998a; Schumann et al.,
  1996; Brown et al., 1997; Konopka and Vogelsberger, 1997; Schr�der et al., 1998a;
  Twohy and Gandrud, 1998), the freezing probability of soot is poorly known because
  unique evidence that soot is directly involved in ice formation is difficult
  to obtain from in situ measurements. On the other hand, fresh soot particles
  do not act as efficient ice (deposition) nuclei in the exhaust (Rogers et al.,
  1998), consistent with the absence of contrails at temperatures above the liquid
  water saturation threshold. </p>
<p>Contrails observed near threshold formation conditions are thought to result
  from freezing of water on soot particles (K�rcher et al., 1996b; Schumann et
  al., 1996; Brown et al., 1997) (<a href="035.htm#img35">Figure 3-5</a>). This result
  is supported by laboratory experiments (DeMott, 1990; Diehl and Mitra, 1998)
  that provide evidence that soot may induce ice formation by heterogeneous immersion
  freezing at temperatures colder than about 250 K. Water activation of soot may
  result from the formation of at least a partial surface coating of H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>/H<span class="subscript">2</span>O
  droplets, which likely develops for average to high fuel sulfur levels (<a href="035.htm#img35">Figure
  3-5</a>). Hence, more fuel sulfur leads to a greater number of ice particles.
  However, observations demonstrate that the number of ice particles (diameter
  > 300 nm) in young contrails increases by only about 30% when the fuel content
  increases from 6 to 2700 ppm (Petzold et al., 1997), as model simulations of
  contrail formation also show (K�rcher et al., 1998a). </p>
<p>Contrails at threshold conditions appear to be formed for very low (2 ppm)
  fuel sulfur content in the same manner as for average fuel sulfur content (260
  ppm) (Busen and Schumann, 1995), but their properties differ measurably for
  larger fuel sulfur content (Schumann et al., 1996). This result suggests that
  soot may take up water even at zero fuel sulfur content, though this uptake
  may be enhanced in the presence of sulfur emissions (K�rcher et al., 1998a;
  see <a href="035.htm#img35">Figure 3-5</a>). </p>
<p>The presence of liquid coatings may alter the chemical reactivity of dry exhaust
  soot, which is poorly known (<a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>). Soot particles
  acting as freezing nuclei have the potential to alter cirrus cloud properties
  (see <a href="038.htm">Section 3.4</a>). Present observations do not rule out
  the possibility that aircraft soot particles can act as freezing nuclei in cirrus
  formation, perhaps even without a H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>/H<span class="subscript">2</span>O coating. Information is lacking
  on how the chemical reactivity and freezing properties of soot might change
  in aging plumes from interactions with background gases and particles or as
  a result of aerosol processing in contrails. </p>
