<H2><b>1.5. Mitigation</b></H2>
<p>Environmental issues regarding emissions from aircraft were originally related
  to their contribution to local air quality in the vicinity of airports. These
  considerations led to the introduction of legislation in the United States resulting
  in domestic regulatory standards. Subsequently, ICAO developed international
  standards and recommended practices for the control of fuel venting and emissions
  of carbon moNO<span class="subscript">x</span>ide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and smoke from aircraft engines
  over a prescribed landing/take-off (LTO) cycle below 915 m (3,000 feet) (ICAO,
  1981). Although the global environmental effects of aircraft emissions have
  been a matter of much debate at a scientific and technical level, there are
  no specific standards for the control of emissions from aircraft during cruise.
  However, the LTO standards in place do indirectly limit emissions from an engine
  during climb and cruise.</p>
<p>The UNFCCC seeks to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
  at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
  climate system. Its coverage includes emissions from all sources and all sectors,
  although it does not specifically refer to aviation. However, the Kyoto Protocol
  to the Convention, which was agreed in December 1997, includes two elements
  that are particularly relevant to aviation. First, the Kyoto Protocol requires
  developed countries to reduce their total national emissions from all sources
  by an average of about 5% for the years 2008-2012 compared with 1990 (with differences
  for individual countries). It contains a provision for so called "flexible mechanisms"-including
  emissions trading, "joint implementation," and a "clean development mechanism."
  Secondly, the Kyoto Protocol contains a provision (Article 2) that calls on
  developed countries to pursue policies and measures for the limitation or reduction
  of greenhouse gases from "aviation bunker fuels," working through ICAO. These
  issues are discussed in <a href="148.htm">Chapter 10</a>.</p>
<p>Future mitigation options and strategies will need to consider the motivation
  for increasing operational efficiencies and reducing fuel use in light of other
  environmental effects of aviation, such as noise. The availability and cost
  of fuel in the overall budget of aircraft operators will continue to exert strong
  pressure for fuel efficiency. A number of technological improvements (e.g.,
  to airframe aerodynamics, aircraft weight, and engine cycle performance) over
  the years have improved the fuel efficiency of subsonic aircraft and engines.
  These innovations have had a direct impact on the amount of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O emitted
  by aircraft (the less fuel consumed, the less CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O emitted) and have
  reduced CO and hydrocarbon emissions. The effect on emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and particles
  is not as simple, however. The drive to improve fuel efficiency and reduce aircraft
  noise has resulted in a general trend to higher operating pressures and temperatures
  in engines and increased production of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> for a given type of combustor technology.
  Combustor design changes can offset this problem to some extent but may result
  in increased complexity and weight. Different considerations may apply to the
  potential second generation of civil supersonic aircraft. The current status
  and potential changes in the technology of engines and aircraft themselves,
  with consequences for emissions, are discussed in <a href="088.htm">Chapter
  7</a>. </p>
<p>Alternative fuels to aviation kerosene are being investigated, and some of
  these fuels have some attractive environmental characteristics. For instance,
  hydrogen offers the potential for eliminating direct CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions, though at
  the expense of increased H<span class="subscript">2</span>O production. None of the alternatives appear capable
  of eliminating both CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and H<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions. The use of such fuels also would
  require the development and implementation of new technology and infrastructure,
  and many factors would need to be considered, including overall energy use,
  energy density, availability, cost, indirect impacts through production, and
  environmental benefits. These issues are also discussed in <a href="088.htm">Chapter
  7</a>. </p>
<p>Future emissions from aviation will also be influenced by the manner in which
  aircraft are operated. At present, there is non-optimum use of airspace and
  ground infrastructure. However, advances in digital communications technology
  and satellite systems should allow new flight management procedures involving
  greater use of computerized air traffic control systems. In principle, such
  systems could lead to reductions in the lengths of routes between certain cities
  and higher traffic volumes in heavily flown corridors. More efficient routing
  would directly reduce fuel use and emissions. Economic and environmental benefits
  also might be enhanced through greater use of meteorological information. Changes
  in flight altitudes and speeds could occur as a result of new aircraft designs
  and operating procedures; these changes would result in aircraft emissions occurring
  at different altitudes. These factors are described in <a href="118.htm">Chapter
  8</a>. </p>
<p>The framework within which technical and operational changes occur is influenced
  by government and industry, with aircraft safety the most important objective.
  Operator fleet decisions are influenced primarily by aircraft mission, performance,
  and operating cost, though aircraft technology and regulatory acceptance are
  significant parameters. Economic instruments such as fuel taxes and emissions
  charges affect an aircraft's operating costs. Aircraft operating limitations
  such as emission caps could directly affect capital investment as well as operating
  costs. On the other hand, new and emerging market mechanisms such as aircraft
  emissions trading are policy instruments that could introduce flexibility into
  regulatory compliance schemes. Such issues are discussed in <a href="148.htm">Chapter
  10</a>. </p>
<p>When evaluating possible options for limiting certain emissions in the future,
  it is important to keep a proper perspective. This report is the first detailed
  assessment of the global environmental effects of a single industrial sector.
  Air transport is only one of a number of transport modes that use fossil fuel,
  either directly or indirectly. Each of these modes may have specific advantages,
  globally or nationally. Other sources of greenhouse gases and other emissions
  also contribute to the composition of the global atmosphere and are likely to
  change with time. The environmental consequences of all emissions (transport
  and non-transport) and the economic impacts associated with different policy
  options will need to be balanced. </p>
<p>In this report, the relative importance of various aircraft emissions are assessed
  according to the best available knowledge of atmospheric effects and in the
  light of current knowledge of future technological options. Economic analyses
  will be required to investigate the consequences of possible mitigation strategies.
  Ideally, these analyses would take into account the wide range of activities
  in the aeronautics and aviation industries and assign monetary value to emissions
  and their effects. The current state of such economic analysis is discussed
  in <a href="148.htm">Chapter 10</a>.</p>
