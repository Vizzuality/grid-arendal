<h2><b>4.2. Model Studies of Subsonic Aircraft</b></h2>
<p> In this section, we discuss the results of global 3-D CTMs used to assess
  the effects of subsonic aircraft on atmospheric concentrations of O<span class="subscript">3</span>,
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and OH. The models differ in their formulations
  of vertical and horizontal resolution, transport, boundary conditions, and chemistry.
  Therefore, a wide range of results is to be expected. A short presentation of
  models and assumptions follows. </p>
<h3><b><i><a name="421"></a>4.2.1. Models Used in Subsonic Aircraft Assessment
  </i></b></h3>
<p><a href="046.htm#tab41">Table 4-1</a> lists the six CTMs used and the names
  of the associated investigators.1 Readers are referred to a Technical Report
  on Subsonic Aircraft Effects, which is presently available over the Internet
  for additional details. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4211"></a>4.2.1.1. Off-Line vs. On-Line Models </i></h4>
<p>All of the models in <a href="046.htm#tab41">Table 4-1</a>, except the ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM
  model, are off-line models; that is, they are driven using meteorological fields
  derived either from GCMs or from analysis of observations. The temporal resolution
  of the various meteorological fields used to drive the models ranges from 40
  minutes to a day. One exception is the IMAGES/ BISA model, which uses monthly-average
  meteorological fields and includes a parameterization to account for shorter-term
  variability in transport. In all of the off-line models, 1 year of wind fields
  is recycled in multiyear simulations to get the steady-state atmosphere. On-line
  calculations provide the potential capability of examining chemistry-climate
  interactions when model-calculated fields are used in radiation calculations.
  In ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM, the evolution of chemical fields is calculated on-line in a
  GCM, but the calculated chemical fields do not feed back into the dynamic calculations
  in this application. The model, therefore, operates in a similar way to the
  off-line models. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4212"></a>4.2.1.2. Model Resolution </i></h4>
<p>Typically, these models have horizontal resolutions of 3-6°, with the exception
  of the UiO model, which has a horizontal resolution of 8°x10°. In the vertical
  dimension, the IMAGES/ BISA model has 25 levels; the Tm<sup>3</sup>/KNMI and ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/ CHEM
  models have 19 levels; and the HARVARD, UKMO, and UiO models have nine levels.
  Four of the models (ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM, HARVARD, Tm<sup>3</sup>/KNMI, UiO) have a top layer located
  at 10 mb; the IMAGES/BISA and UKMO models have top layers located at 50 mb and
  100 mb, respectively. Because vertical model levels are defined on sigma coordinates
  and not on pressure coordinates, the number of model levels between fixed pressure
  surfaces can vary in time. Between the surface and 850 mb, the HARVARD, UiO,
  and UKMO models have about two vertical levels; the ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM and Tm<sup>3</sup>/KNMI
  models have about five vertical levels, and the IMAGES/BISA model has eight
  vertical levels. In the UT/LS region between 100 and 300 mb, the HARVARD model
  has one vertical level, the UKMO model has about two levels, and the other four
  models have about four vertical levels. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4213"></a>4.2.1.3. Coupling to the Stratosphere </i></h4>
<p>With the exception of the ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM model, the models have little or no representation
  of explicit stratospheric chemistry. Instead, either the cross-tropopause fluxes
  of O<span class="subscript">3</span> and NOy are specified or the mixing ratios
  of these species are specified in the LS based on observations. In the Tm<sup>3</sup>/KNMI,
  UiO, and IMAGES/BISA models, however, the upper boundaries are higher in an
  attempt to minimize their influence on regions of maximum perturbations by aircraft.
  It should be noted that this condition may not be satisfied for the IMAGES/BISA
  model because the model top is at 50 mb. </p>
<h4> <i><a name="4214"></a>4.2.1.4. Tropospheric NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  Sources </i></h4>
<p>All of the models include anthropogenic and biogenic tropospheric NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  sources. For present-day conditions, the magnitudes of surface NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  sources in the various models are ~21 Tg nitrogen (N) yr<sup>-1</sup> from surface-based
  fossil-fuel combustion, 5-12 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup> from biomass burning, and 4-6 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>
  from soils. The present-day magnitude of the lightning source is 5 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>
  in the IMAGES/BISA, Tm<sup>3</sup>/KNMI, UKMO, and UiO models; 4 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup> in the ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM
  model (increased to 5 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup> in the 2015 and 2050 simulations); and 3 Tg
  N yr<sup>-1</sup> in the HARVARD model. It should be noted, however, that the simulated
  impact of lightning on NOy species in the troposphere can differ from model
  to model even if the magnitude of the lightning source of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  is the same, as a result of differences in factors such as duration and intensity
  of convective events, land/ocean differences in convection, height of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  emissions, and so forth. Sensitivity tests were run to evaluate the effect of
  this lightning assumption on calculated aircraft perturbation. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4215"></a>4.2.1.5. Tropospheric Chemistry </i></h4>
<p>Most of the models include a comprehensive description of the CH<span class="subscript">4</span>-CO-NO<span class="subscript">x</span>-HO<span class="subscript">x</span>-O<span class="subscript">3</span>
  chemical system. With the exception of ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM and Tm<sup>3</sup>/KNMI, the models
  include representations of NMHC chemistry. However, the details of NMHC chemistry
  differ significantly from model to model. The ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM model includes a stratosphere
  with a chemistry scheme more suited to the stratosphere, however, it does not
  include some of the species that are important for tropospheric chemistry. </p>

<h4><i><a name="4216"></a>4.2.1.6. Tropospheric Transport </i></h4>
<p>In addition to transport by resolved-scale winds, all models considered here
  include parameterizations of vertical transport by sub-grid-scale processes
  such as convection and turbulent mixing in the boundary layer. Again, the manner
  in which these processes are parameterized differs from model to model. In this
  context, it is worth noting that four of the models (or their close counterparts)
  used in this exercise (ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM, HARVARD, UKMO, and Tm<sup>3</sup>/KNMI) were also involved
  in a model intercomparison exercise sponsored by the World Climate Research
  Program (WCRP) in 1993 (Jacob et al., 1997). As part of this exercise, each
  model simulated a scenario in which a fictitious tracer with a 5.5-day e-folding
  lifetime was emitted in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude UT. The vertical
  gradient in the simulated fields was similar in several of the participating
  models. However, there were significant inter-model differences in the simulated
  rates of meridional tracer transport in the UT. </p>
<h3><b><i><a name="422"></a>4.2.2. Definition of Scenarios</i></b></h3>
<p>This section describes the scenarios for aircraft emissions evaluated for this
  assessment. The premises for current (circa 1992) and future (roughly 2015 and
  2050) aircraft fleet emissions, along with descriptions of actual emissions
  databases, are given in <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a>. The assumptions used
  for the background atmosphere in model calculations of the effects of aircraft
  emissions on O<span class="subscript">3</span> are important and influence the
  results. In the following sections, we discuss the basis for background atmospheres
  used in model calculations and the aircraft scenarios evaluated. </p>
<h4><i><a name="4221"></a>4.2.2.1. Background Atmospheres </i></h4>
<p>Boundary conditions for CH<span class="subscript">4</span> in the background
  atmosphere are 1714, 2052, and 2793 ppbv for the years 1992, 2015, and 2050,
  respectively. These amounts are based on the IPCC IS92a scenario (IPCC, 1992,
  1995). Updated projections for future CH<span class="subscript">4</span> concentrations
  (WMO, 1999) are smaller than those assumed here. Recent observations by Dlugokencky
  et al. (1998) show that CH<span class="subscript">4</span> levels currently
  are leveling off. If this trend continues during the next century, with little
  or no increase in the CH<span class="subscript">4</span> concentration, the
  increase in background O<span class="subscript">3</span> will also be substantially
  less than that calculated in these studies. </p>

<p>For shorter lived gases-such as CO, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and
  volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-the participating models use their standard
  boundary conditions for the 1992 cases. For 2015 and 2050, most model calculations
  assume that emissions are increased by the same factors at all locations relative
  to 1992 emissions, as shown in <a href="047.htm#tab42">Table 4-2</a>. Such constant
  increases were necessitated by difficulties in 3-D models to readily change
  emission inputs for assessment studies. </p>
<p>A special sensitivity study was also conducted for 2050 with the UiO model
  using a geographically varying emission increase (IPCC, 1995). A summary of
  these factors is presented in <a href="047.htm#tab43">Table 4-3</a>. Such regional
  differential factors are applied only to energy-related sources; biomass burning
  factors are applied as in the standard case (using <a href="047.htm#tab42">Table
  4-2</a>). </p>
<h4><i><a name="4222"></a>4.2.2.2. Aircraft Emission Scenarios </i></h4>
<p>The 3-D aircraft scenarios described in <a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a> form
  the basis for the assessment. The scenarios evaluated by the participating models
  are summarized in <a href="047.htm#tab44">Table 4-4</a>. Summaries of global
  emissions for these scenarios are given in Tables <a href="135.htm#tab94">9-4</a>
  and <a href="136.htm#tab95">9-5</a>. Only a few scenarios are considered for
  subsonic assessment calculations because computational requirements for the
  3-D models are high. The subsonic scenarios in <a href="047.htm#tab44">Table
  4-4</a> are generally analyzed relative to corresponding background atmospheres
  for 1992, 2015, or 2050. </p>
<p>In model calculations, aircraft effluents are put into the models as follows:
  Gridded fuel burn data (kg fuel/day) are first mapped into the model grid. The
  amount of material emitted into each grid box is given by the product of the
  fuel burn and the emission index. The emitted material is put into the grid
  box at each time step at the equivalent rate. In this approach, we ignore the
  effect of plume processing and assume that emitted material is instantaneously
  mixed into the grid box. For the subsonic assessment, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  is the only aircraft emission considered. Because most models do not calculate
  the hydrological cycle in the troposphere, emitted water is not calculated.
  Sulfur, CO, and unburned hydrocarbons are also ignored.</p>
<p>The basic scenarios examine some of the important aspects in understanding
  the calculated environmental impact of aircraft. However, a number of uncertainties
  remain in the treatment of chemical and physical processes that may influence
  the effects from aircraft emissions. Therefore, a series of special sensitivity
  calculations was designed to investigate the most important of the recognized
  uncertainties. The subsonic aircraft sensitivity scenarios, as described later,
  examine uncertainties in the background atmosphere, the treatment of chemical
  and dynamical processes in the UT and LS, and different analyses of aircraft
  emissions. </p>
<p>It has not been possible (for practical reasons) for each of the modeling groups
  to run all of the scenarios set up for these 3-D model studies of aircraft perturbations.
  Each modeling group has completed a limited number of model simulations. <br>
