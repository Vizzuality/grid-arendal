<p><a href="048.htm#img41">Figure 4-1</a> presents annual zonal average increases 
  of O<span class="subscript">3</span> volume mixing ratios caused by aircraft 
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions predicted by the six models for 
  the year 2015. As this figure shows, the models treat the tropopause significantly 
  differently, which leads to qualitatively different O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  distributions and calculated O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbations 
  near the tropopause. The UiO model calculates a maximum increase of O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  of about 9 ppbv around 40-80°N at an elevation of 10-13 km. Throughout most 
  of the Northern Hemisphere, increases larger than 1 ppbv are calculated. The 
  IMAGES/BISA and HARVARD models calculate somewhat smaller peak perturbations 
  of about 7 ppbv. In contrast, the Tm<sup>3</sup>/KNMI and the UKMO models calculate 
  maximum changes of about 11 ppbv. The UKMO model computes large increases up 
  to the 16-km level, probably as a result of relatively large vertical exchange 
  rates in the vicinity of the tropopause. In contrast to the other models, the 
  ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM model predicts the highest O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  perturbations in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere LS. Tropospheric 
  changes are smaller than in the other models, however. The difference may be 
  partly a result of the length of the ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM model run. This 
  model has a representation of the stratosphere and reported results from the 
  average of the last 10 years of a 15-year simulation-long enough to propagate 
  aircraft emissions and O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbation in the 
  Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere (via the stratosphere). The other 
  3-D models do not account for such stratospheric transport processes because 
  they constrain O<span class="subscript">3</span> concentrations in their upper 
  model levels: They fix their upper model layer concentrations using observations, 
  or they prescribe O<span class="subscript">3</span> fluxes from the stratosphere 
  into the troposphere. The use of these boundary conditions could lead to a calculated 
  impact on stratospheric O<span class="subscript">3</span> that is too small. 
  It may also be that the ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM model has too efficient transport 
  in the LS. </p>
<p>The effect of constraining concentrations and fluxes at the upper boundary 
  of the 3-D models was checked by running the stratospheric 2-D Atmospheric and 
  Environmental Research, Inc. (AER) model for the same subsonic scenario. Consistent 
  with the 3-D models, the AER model calculates a maximum O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  increase of 8-10 ppbv in the Northern Hemisphere at an altitude of 8-12 km. 
  In the stratosphere at 16 km, small increases of 2 ppbv in the Southern Hemisphere 
  and 6 ppbv in the Northern Hemisphere are calculated-somewhat higher, but consistent 
  with most 3-D models. Calculated O<span class="subscript">3</span> increases 
  are strongest in the UT and the LS. In the lower troposphere (< 6 km), the increase 
  is reduced by a factor of about 5 in mixing ratio compared to the UT. All models 
  calculate that about 85% of the O<span class="subscript">3</span> increase for 
  1992 is in the Northern Hemisphere; for 2015 and 2050, the portions are about 
  80 and 75%, respectively. </p>
<p>Although emissions of precursor NO<span class="subscript">x</span> are spatially 
  distributed heterogeneously, the resulting O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  increases are distributed more uniformly as a result of the combined effects 
  of strong longitudinal mixing and the relatively long residence time of O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  in the free troposphere and LS. All models show efficient transport of excess 
  O<span class="subscript">3</span> from source regions at mid-latitudes to high 
  latitudes, where the residence time of O<span class="subscript">3</span> is 
  particularly long as a result of decreased deposition (Stevenson et al., 1997; 
  Wauben et al., 1997; Berntsen and Isaksen, 1999). </p>
<p>There may be a strong seasonal cycle in the calculated impact of aircraft emissions 
  on O<span class="subscript">3</span>. For example, using the same emission scenarios, 
  the UiO and the UKMO models calculate a 40% larger increase of O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  in the Northern Hemisphere in April compared to July (Stevenson et al., 1997; 
  Berntsen and Isaksen, 1999). Other models find much weaker seasonal cycles (e.g., 
  IMAGES/BISA and ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM), or find maximum increases in summer 
  (e.g., Tm<sup>3</sup>/KNMI and HARVARD). These seasonal differences are probably 
  associated with different background NO<span class="subscript">x</span> conditions 
  in the different models (see <a href="048.htm#4232">Section 4.2.3.2</a>). </p>
<h4><i><a name="4232"></a>4.2.3.2. NO<span class="subscript">x</span> Perturbation 
  </i></h4>
<p><a href="048.htm#img42">Figure 4-2</a> shows calculated zonal average increases 
  of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> from aircraft emissions in July 2015. 
  In the Northern Hemisphere, all but one model calculate increases of up to 150 
  pptv. These increases can be compared with background levels of 50-200 pptv 
  at northern mid-latitudes in the 12-km region. In the stratosphere, the ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM 
  model calculates larger increases, probably as a result of more efficient transport 
  to the stratosphere. The height distribution of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  increases is very similar among models. All models also predict noticeable increases 
  in upper tropospheric NO<span class="subscript">x</span> at low latitudes in 
  the Southern Hemisphere. Only small increases are estimated in the lower troposphere. 
  Background NO<span class="subscript">x</span> conditions, however, are rather 
  different in the 3-D CTMs. For instance, at 12 km at 50°N, calculated background 
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> mixing ratios may vary, depending on the 
  season, by a factor of 2 to 4. Such large differences could be important for 
  O<span class="subscript">3</span> production because of the nonlinear dependency 
  of net O<span class="subscript">3</span> production on NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  concentrations, although, for the model scenarios explored, the global O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  increase appears to be almost linear for most of the anticipated NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  injections in the models (see <a href="048.htm#img43">Figure 4-3</a>). </p>

</table>
<p><a href="048.htm#img43">Figure 4-3</a> presents the increase of global O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  abundance up to 16 km from aircraft emissions. The annual emissions of 0.5, 
  1.27, and 2.17 Tg N correspond to (projected) emissions for 1992, 2015, and 
  2050, respectively. Calculated O<span class="subscript">3</span> increases range 
  from 4 to 7 Tg in 1992, 9 to 17 Tg in 2015, and 19 to 24 Tg in 2050. For each 
  CTM, the global O<span class="subscript">3</span> increase scales almost linearly 
  with aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions-even for the 2050 
  high-demand sensitivity study G (3.46 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>). However, O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  production is less efficient at high NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions. 
  The nearly linear response of global O<span class="subscript">3</span> increase 
  to aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions was not anticipated, 
  given the well-known nonlinear O<span class="subscript">3</span> production 
  as a function of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> (discussed in <a href="020.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>). The main explanation seems to be that aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  and associated reservoir species (e.g., HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>) 
  are transported out of aircraft corridors, where net O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  production depends more linearly on NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. We should 
  recognize, however, that all of the global models used in this study have a 
  coarse resolution that may systematically overestimate the O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  production. Secondary effects are background increases in CH<span class="subscript">4</span> 
  and CO (as a result of enhanced surface emissions in 2015 and 2050), leading 
  to somewhat more efficient O<span class="subscript">3</span> production per 
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> molecule emitted, and the shift of emissions 
  from Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes toward the tropics, where background 
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> concentrations are smaller. </p>
<p>To further test linearity in O<span class="subscript">3</span> increases to 
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission beyond the upper limit selected 
  in these model studies, an extremely high NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  emission of 1.5 times the high-demand, low-technology case (Scenario G) was 
  run with the UiO model. This scenario showed only slight nonlinearity at lower 
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions. This extreme simulation indicated 
  that a level of nonlinearity was reached at northern latitudes where O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  increases of only 10% were obtained, whereas at southern latitudes, where emissions 
  are smaller, O<span class="subscript">3</span> increases (approximately 50%) 
  were nearly linear with increases in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions. 
</p>
<p><a href="048.htm#img44">Figure 4-4</a> shows the global increases of total O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  from aircraft emissions in 2015 and 2050 relative to those in 1992-that is, 
  the difference of O<span class="subscript">3</span> budgets for scenarios listed 
  in <a href="047.htm#tab44">Table 4-4</a> (D with respect to B and F with respect 
  to B). The same figure also shows the increases of O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  in 2015 and 2050 from the effects of changes in surface emissions (<a href="047.htm#4221">Section 
  4.2.2.1</a>)-that is, the differences for scenarios C with respect to A and 
  E with respect to A. Aircraft emissions account for approximately 15-30% of 
  the total O<span class="subscript">3</span> increase in 2015 and 15-20% in 2050. 
  It should be noted, however, that the projections of aircraft emissions and 
  the IPCC IS92a scenario underlying the increase of surface emissions are extremely 
  uncertain. Changes in aircraft or surface emissions scenarios could change the 
  relative contribution from aircraft emissions to O<span class="subscript">3</span> 
  perturbations significantly. Using scenario G (high demand), an approximately 
  45% higher increase of O<span class="subscript">3</span> from aircraft is calculated 
  in 2050 by the UiO model (see sensitivity studies). </p>

  As discussed in <a href="025.htm">Section 2.1.4</a>, aircraft NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  emissions lead to higher OH concentrations. In the troposphere, CH<span class="subscript">4</span> 
  is removed mainly by reaction with the OH radical. Therefore, a higher OH concentration 
  will lead to more rapid removal of CH<span class="subscript">4</span> from the 
  atmosphere. <a href="048.htm#tab45">Table 4-5</a> presents the chemical lifetime 
  of CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and changes from aircraft emissions for 
  scenarios A-F. The lifetime in <a href="048.htm#tab45">Table 4-5</a> is defined 
  as the CH<span class="subscript">4</span> amount up to 300 hPa divided by the 
  amount annually destroyed by chemical processes. There are large differences 
  in CH<span class="subscript">4</span> lifetimes calculated by the models for 
  base cases A, C, and E. It is beyond the scope of this report to assess what 
  causes these differences, but it can be generally said that global OH is very 
  sensitive to photolysis rates, parameterization of lightning NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  emissions, and the amount and distribution of surface NO<span class="subscript">x</span> 
  and other emissions. Comparing simulations A, C, and E, which show enhancements 
  from changes in surface emissions, CH<span class="subscript">4</span> lifetimes 
  increase by 0.5-3.2% from 1992 to 2015 and by 7-12% from 1992 to 2050. The decrease 
  of OH concentrations is a result of the strong effect of anthropogenic CO emissions 
  and higher background CH<span class="subscript">4</span> concentrations, which 
  dominate the effect of surface emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span>. 
  The models are rather consistent in their estimates of changes of CH<span class="subscript">4</span> 
  lifetimes from aircraft emissions. Comparing simulations with and without aircraft 
  emissions, CH<span class="subscript">4</span> lifetimes are calculated to decrease 
  globally by 1.2-1.5% in 1992, 1.6-2.9% in 2015, and 2.3-4.3% in 2050.<br>
<br>
  Changes in calculated CH<span class="subscript">4</span> lifetime from aircraft 
  emissions for the three time periods considered are surprisingly similar in 
  the model studies. With the exception of the ECHAm<sup>3</sup>/CHEM model, which 
  gives smaller perturbations than the other models because it uses a fixed mixing 
  ratio boundary condition for CO, the differences among models for aircraft impacts 
  are within 20%. This perturbation of CH<span class="subscript">4</span> residence 
  time from aircraft emissions is significantly larger than that obtained in previous 
  studies (IPCC, 1995; Fuglestvedt et al., 1996) using 2-D models. CH<span class="subscript">4</span> 
  loss is dominated by OH changes in the tropical and subtropical regions of the 
  lower troposphere. These previous studies showed OH changes that were largely 
  restricted to the UT, where OH perturbations have little impact on CH<span class="subscript">4</span> 
  residence time. <a href="048.htm#img45">Figure 4-5a</a> shows the perturbation 
  in the zonally averaged OH field (July) for 2015 aircraft emissions (given in 
  106 molecules/cm<sup>-3</sup>) from the UiO model. The figure shows that the 
  perturbations extend well into the lower troposphere at most latitudes in the 
  Northern Hemisphere. One explanation for this result could be that CO, which 
  accounts for most of the OH loss, has a sufficiently long lifetime to be transported 
  over large distances. The impact on CO in one region could influence CO (<a href="048.htm#img45">Figure 
  4-5b</a>) and OH in other regions (e.g., low-latitude lower troposphere), leading 
  to the estimated impact on CH<span class="subscript">4</span>. Similar CO changes 
  were found, for example, in the Tm<sup>3</sup>/ KNMI model. In addition to changes 
  in CO, relatively small O<span class="subscript">3</span> changes are predicted 
  in the warm humid tropics. These changes also lead to somewhat increased OH 
  production, hence a decrease in CH<span class="subscript">4</span> lifetime. 
  Thus, changes in CH<span class="subscript">4</span> lifetime are related in 
  direct and indirect ways to changes in O<span class="subscript">3</span> concentrations 
  and probably should be assessed together. The difference in estimated residence 
  time compared with previous 2-D studies could therefore be a result of very 
  different transport parameterizations in 2-D and 3-D models.<br>

<br><p>The reduction in CH<span class="subscript">4</span> lifetime would lead to a nearly uniform CH<span class="subscript">4</span> reduction
  globally because of the relatively long residence time computed for CH<span class="subscript">4</span>. This
  result would be in contrast to O<span class="subscript">3</span>, for which changes would occur on large regional
  scales. Finally, it should be noted that for computational reasons, the experiments
  in this assessment were performed using fixed CH<span class="subscript">4</span> concentrations at the Earth's
  surface (see <a href="047.htm#4221">Section 4.2.2.1</a>), and CH<span class="subscript">4</span> concentrations
  at the surface were not allowed to adapt to higher OH abundances (positive feedback).
  Hence, even larger CH<span class="subscript">4</span> decreases are to be expected if CH<span class="subscript">4</span> ground flux boundary
  conditions are used. However, such calculations are much more computationally
  intensive. IPCC (1995) and Fuglestvedt et al. (1996) showed that the feedback
  factor is uncertain and model-dependent but is estimated to be in the range
  1.2-1.5. Adopting a factor of 1.4 increases the percentage changes, in the CH<span class="subscript">4</span>
  lifetimes shown in <a href="048.htm#tab45">Table 4-5</a>, to -2.2 to -4.1% in
  2015 and -3.2 to -6.0% in 2050. Changes in CH<span class="subscript">4</span> lifetime of this order will lead
  to global average radiative forcing (see <a href="063.htm">Chapter 6</a>) similar
  to global average radiative forcing perturbations from aircraft-induced O<span class="subscript">3</span> changes,
  but with an opposite sign (CH<span class="subscript">4</span> will be reduced). </p>

<p>In this section, we focus on a limited set of sensitivity studies that help
  define the uncertainty range of the model calculations. Ideally, a large number
  of simulations should have been performed by all the participating models. However,
  only a limited number of model simulations was possible because of time constraints
  and the demand of computer resources for 3-D CTM studies. Therefore, only one
  or two models have performed each of the sensitivity studies. Also, some uncertainties
  cannot be addressed properly. For example, modeled upper tropospheric and lower
  stratospheric NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and NOy concentrations are extremely uncertain and are difficult
  to compare to measurements because of large temporal and spatial variations
  and a limited number of observations (see <a href="020.htm">Chapter 2</a>).
  There may be additional uncertainties from unknown processes that feed back
  on increases in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> and O<span class="subscript">3</span> in a future modified atmosphere. </p>
<p>The sensitivity studies focus on the impact on O<span class="subscript">3</span>. The following studies were
  performed: </p>
<ul>
  <p>Sensitivity of aircraft-induced O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbations to background NO<span class="subscript">x</span> levels
    from lightning. This finding is obtained by increasing global average NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
    production from 5 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>, which is used in the reference case, to 12 Tg
    N yr<sup>-1</sup>. The same spatial distribution is used in both cases. <br>
    Sensitivity of O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbation to different regional growth in emissions.
    In the base case (IS92a), a uniform growth rate was used for the surface emission
    of pollutants. The sensitivity run was performed with the same global growth
    rate as in the base case but with the different regional growth rates given
    in <a href="047.htm#tab43">Table 4-3</a>. <br>
    Sensitivity to different projections of aircraft emissions. Instead of NASA
    2015 emissions, the ANCAT-2015 aircraft emission data set was used. Total
    ANCAT emissions for the year 2015 are about 15% larger than the NASA emissions
    (see <a href="137.htm">Section 9.3.4</a>). Further differences relate to
    the location and seasonal variations of emissions.<br>
    Sensitivity to inclusion of NMHC chemistry. This study was conducted by making
    runs in which NMHC chemistry was excluded and comparing the results with those
    in which NMHC chemistry was included. <br>
    Sensitivity to neglecting heterogeneous chemistry on background sulfate aerosols.
    This sensitivity was estimated by comparing results with and without the heterogeneous
    nitrogen pentoxide (N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span>) + H<span class="subscript">2</span>O reaction on aerosol. The aerosol surface area
    was derived from model calculations of the sulfur cycle. Hydrolysis of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span>
    on wet aerosol converts active NO<span class="subscript">x</span> into the reservoir species HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>, which
    is effectively removed by rain out. Hence, in the base case, less NOy is present
    in the free troposphere and LS, and emissions by aircraft are more effective
    in producing O<span class="subscript">3</span>.<br>
    Sensitivity to interannual variability in meteorology. <br>
    Sensitivity to uncertainty in emissions in 2050. This study is carried out
    by using scenario G instead of scenario F from <a href="047.htm#tab44">Table
    4-4</a>. Total NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission changes from 2 to 3.5 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>. </p>

  2015 (i.e., scenario D-C) and O<span class="subscript">3</span>,2 is the same increase calculated for the sensitivity
  study (i.e., scenario D'-C'). The sensitivity studies show that increases in
  background NO<span class="subscript">x</span> from lightning (sensitivity study 1) and different growth rates
  in surface emissions in different regions (sensitivity study 2) have only a
  slight impact on O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbation from aircraft 
  emissions. In both cases, O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbations are reduced. This finding shows
  that O<span class="subscript">3</span> production in the UT and LS is limited by NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, rather than by hydrocarbons.
  Interannual variability in meteorology (sensitivity study 6) and exclusion of
  heterogeneous removal of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span> in the models also led to a small change in global
  average O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbation (sensitivity study 5). Excluding hydrocarbon chemistry
  (sensitivity study 4) would have a significant impact on O<span class="subscript">3</span>, resulting in a
  smaller perturbation. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the
  results between the two models used to perform the study. Comparison of results
  with two different emission scenarios (sensitivity study 3) showed a noticeable
  impact on global O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbation. Sensitivity study 7, which was set up to test
  the response of O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbation to greatly increased NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission from aircraft
  (estimated upper limit in 2050), showed that the response is nearly linear and
  similar to what is computed for smaller NO<span class="subscript">x</span> perturbations. </p>
  It should be noted that the comparisons in <a href="048.htm#tab46">Table 4-6</a>
  are made for global average O<span class="subscript">3</span> perturbations; sensitivities are larger on regional
