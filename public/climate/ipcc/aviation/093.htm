<h2><b>7.3. Airframe Performance and Technology</b></h2>
<p>Historically, efforts to improvement aerodynamic efficiency have been aimed
  mainly at two phases of flight: Take-off/climb and cruise. To this end, significant
  improvements in lift and drag performance have been achieved (Lynch et al.,
  1996). A comprehensive range of detailed aerodynamic studies, examining all
  aspects of the complex flows around the airframe, has been a major part of these
  efforts. Such work, involving the development and use of high fidelity computational
  fluid dynamics (CFD) prediction codes (Rubbert, 1994) coupled with improved
  wind tunnel testing techniques (Lynch and Crites, 1996), has led to much better
  understanding of the aerodynamic characteristics of new and proposed designs.
  In turn, this work has led naturally to improved predictions of the effectiveness
  of measures aimed at improving the performance of aircraft in general and reducing
  fuel burn rates for future aircraft in particular.</p>
<h3>7.3.1. Aerodynamic Improvement <a name="731"></a></h3>
<p>Historically, efforts to improvement aerodynamic efficiency have been aimed
  mainly at two phases of flight: Take-off/climb and cruise. To this end, significant
  improvements in lift and drag performance have been achieved (Lynch et al.,
  1996). A comprehensive range of detailed aerodynamic studies, examining all
  aspects of the complex flows around the airframe, has been a major part of these
  efforts. Such work, involving the development and use of high fidelity computational
  fluid dynamics (CFD) prediction codes (Rubbert, 1994) coupled with improved

  understanding of the aerodynamic characteristics of new and proposed designs.
  In turn, this work has led naturally to improved predictions of the effectiveness
  of measures aimed at improving the performance of aircraft in general and reducing
  fuel burn rates for future aircraft in particular. </p>
<h3><b>7.3.2. Airframe Weight Reduction<a name="732"></a></b></h3>
<p>The increasing availability of advanced lighter and stronger materials for
  use in structural components of the airframe has also been a major factor in
  the achievement of reduced fuel burn. Of particular note are the greater use
  of new aluminum alloys, titanium components, and composite materials for secondary
  (non-load-bearing) structures. </p>
<p>One of the important enabling technologies that has had a major impact on these
  developments is high-fidelity finite element models (FEMs). FEMs are now extensively
  used for strength analyses and to obtain better understanding of safety load-factor
  margins. This work has already contributed to additional reductions in structural
  weight.</p>
<h3>7.3.3. Nacelle Efficiency <a name="733"></a></h3>
<p>As engine bypass ratios (fan bypass airflow divided by engine core flow) have
  risen over the past 2 decades, so too have the drag and weight of the nacelle
  (aerodynamic casing surrounding the engine). Furthermore, integration of the
  engine and the nacelle-which incorporates the air inlet, the engine, and the
  exhaust nozzle-can be a source of significant interference drag problems. On
  balance, however, high bypass ratio engines have provided a significant gain
  for transport aircraft in terms of reduced fuel requirements for a given mission.
  This development has led to greater performance flexibility for operators wishing
  to optimize range and payload, hence take-off weights, compared with earlier
  low bypass ratio engines. Improvements in the aerodynamics of engine-nacelle
  flows and changes to the shape and length of the inlet section continue to reduce
  local drag effects and increase efficiency. The current trend is toward higher
  bypass ratio ducted fan engines having shorter and thinner lip inlets. This
  approach may be limited in the future, however, by the need to meet more stringent
  noise regulations. The development of lighter nacelle materials/ structures
  has reduced operating empty weight (OEW). Increasing thrust reverser efficiency
  for enhanced landing performance can also reduce nacelle package weight.</p>
<h3>7.3.4. Propulsion/Airframe Integration (PAI) <a name="734"></a></h3>
<p>Reduction of interference drag caused by flow interactions in the region of
  the wing-pylon-nacelle during take-off/climb/ cruise conditions is a complex
  design problem (Berry, 1994). Recent improvements in modeling localized airflow,
  using CFD, have brought important benefits in terms of reduced interference
  drag (Lynch and Intemann, 1994). There is an inevitable tradeoff between the
  higher drag of high bypass ratio engines and the need to minimize interference
  drag for a given mission fuel burn; a great deal of effort is aimed at achieving
  an optimum balance. For example, if the nacelle can be located closer to the
  wing without creating interference penalties, it is possible to reduce pylon
  weight and drag and reduce landing gear height (and weight). Other tradeoffs,
  such as noise impacts, also need to be considered. </p>
<h3>7.3.5. Control Systems <a name="735"></a></h3>
<p>Older technology aircraft use mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical systems
  to control flight, propulsion, and environmental systems. Today's modern airframes
  and airframes under design utilize much lighter fly-by-light (using fiber optics)
  and fly-by-wire technology, with significant savings in OEW. </p>
<p>Changes to aircraft pressurization and air conditioning systems-particularly
  increases in the amount of air, which is now recirculated-has reduced engine
  bleed flow requirements. These measures have significantly reduced engine fuel
  burn at cruise conditions. Cabin air quality requirements, however, might limit
  these methods of achieving further fuel savings.</p>
<p>More detailed analysis of PAI/high-lift system interference is regarded as
  a way to achieve weight reductions in low-speed/take-off drag. Again, CFD techniques
  are invaluable tools in achieving such improvements. The design of a high-lift
  system that can provide the same lift versus drag performance at a lower weight
  is seen as another path towards overall aircraft system improvements that would
  result in fuel savings.</p>
<p>Increasing use of databus (multiplexing of signals) technology has led to significant
  reduction in the amount of wiring needed to support the numerous advanced electrical
  systems in modern aircraft. Although increased wire shielding has become necessary,
  the overall result has led to further reductions in airframe OEW.</p>
