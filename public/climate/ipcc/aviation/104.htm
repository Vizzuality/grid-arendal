<h2> 7.6. Turbine and Nozzle Effects on Emissions</h2>
<p>This section describes what is known and not known about changes in various
  exhaust constituents that occur downstream of the combustor, in the air passages
  of the turbine and exhaust nozzle. The discussion centers on chemical species
  that are expected to have the highest potential for impact on the global atmosphere
  (see <a href="020.htm">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="031.htm">3</a>).</p>

<p>The discussion begins in <a href="104.htm#761">Section 7.6.1</a> with a review
  of the factors that have generated interest in chemical processes in the turbine
  and exhaust nozzle. <a href="104.htm#762">Section 7.6.2</a> provides a brief
  overview of functional requirements and constraints for aircraft turbines and
  nozzles, and how these requirements have led to particular design choices. <a href="104.htm#763">Section
  7.6.3</a> describes the relevant chemical and fluid mechanical effects. <a href="105.htm">Section
  7.6.4</a> describes what is known and not known regarding chemical changes in
  the turbine and exhaust nozzle. </p>
<h3><a name="761"></a>7.6.1. Chemical Processes in Turbine and Exhaust Nozzle</h3>
<p>Many engine exhaust species of interest for environmental impact assessment
  exist in trace amounts, typically tens of ppbv to tens of ppmv. Despite their
  relatively small concentrations, these trace species emissions can result in
  perturbations of chemical species in the atmosphere that may induce significant
  atmospheric effects. <a href="020.htm">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="031.htm">3</a>
  discuss these issues in relation to atmospheric ozone and cloudiness, respectively.
  Numerical simulations and a limited number of experiments suggest that several
  of these trace species can undergo considerable change within the nonuniform,
  unsteady flow fields of the turbine and nozzle prior to injection into the atmosphere
  (Hunter, 1982; Harris, 1990; Brown et al., 1996; Lukachko et al., 1998). However,
  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the extent of this change and
  its dependence on engine technology and operating conditions. Indeed, estimates
  for the extent of sulfur oxidation (SO<span class="subscript">2</span> ' SO<span class="subscript">3</span> + H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>) range from 0.4 to 45%
  or more depending on the modeling assumptions and experimental data considered
  (Hunter, 1982; Harris, 1990; Arnold et al., 1994, 1999; Frenzel and Arnold,
  1994; Miake-Lye et al., 1994; Fahey et al., 1995b; Brown et al., 1996; Kärcher
  et al., 1996; Hanisco et al., 1997; Lukachko et al., 1998; Miake-Lye et al.,
  1998). However, most of the predicted conversion efficiencies are less than
  10%, with an experimentally derived lower limit of 0.34% (Curtius et al., 1998)
  (see <a href="034.htm#3222">Section 3.2.2.2</a>). More important, such variations
  in estimates of the extent of sulfur oxidation within the engine and subsequent
  changes in aerosol formation lead to changes in predicted column ozone depletion
  by a fleet of supersonic transport aircraft by as much as a factor of 2 (Weisenstein
  et al., 1995; Danilin et al., 1997). Large uncertainty regarding trace species
  processes and the perception that intra-engine changes may be important-along
  with the desire for a more detailed and complete characterization of engine
  exhaust emissions to support downstream plume, wake, and atmospheric modeling
  efforts-have only recently motivated a more detailed study of intra-engine trace
  species chemistry (Dryer et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1996; NRC, 1997; Lukachko
  et al., 1998). There is relatively little research yet reported in this area;
  however, new measurement and modeling capabilities are currently being developed.</p>
<h3><a name="762"></a>7.6.2. Aircraft Turbine and Nozzle Design</h3>
<p><a href="095.htm">Sections 7.4</a> and <a href="099.htm">7.5</a> discuss the
  principal elements and functions of the components of a gas turbine engine.
  They describe how, after exiting the combustor, the engine core flow passes
  into the turbine then through the exhaust nozzle (<a href="094.htm#img77">Figure
  7-7</a> et seq.). Within these components, the principal engineering constraints
  are associated with maintenance of the structural integrity of the parts exposed
  to the high-temperature environment downstream of the combustor and limitations
  on weight. </p>
<p><a href="103.htm#img724">Figure 7-24</a> shows an example of a modern turbine
  stage. The design of the flow passages ensures maximum operating efficiency
  and meets engineering integrity requirements of the compressor and combustor.
  As explained in <a href="095.htm">Section 7.4</a>, the achievement of high thermal
  efficiency, hence low fuel consumption, means that turbines operate in gas flows
  that are several hundred Kelvin above the melting point of the materials employed
  (see, e.g., Kerrebrock, 1992). Cooling of all structures exposed to the flow
  path is therefore essential. The requirement for cooling adds significant complexity
  to the blades and vanes because of the need for small internal passages through
  which air bled from the compressor is channelled. This air is usually injected
  through small holes in the surfaces of the various components (as shown in <a href="103.htm#img724">Figure
  7-24</a>) to form a protective, cooler boundary layer. Air injected in this
  manner can account for as much as 25% of the flow through the core of the engine.
  The trend for increased temperature and pressure is expected to continue in
  the future, as discussed in <a href="095.htm">Section 7.4</a>. </p>

<p><a href="103.htm#img725">Figure 7-25</a> shows the mean temperature and pressure
  history as a function of time through the aft end of a typical engine, to illustrate
  pressure and temperature ranges in which trace species chemistry occurs. Turbine
  inlet temperatures vary within the flight cycle from 1200 to more than 2000
  K, and pressures vary from 0.8-4.5 MPa. The gases remain in residence within
  the turbine and nozzle for approximately 5-10 ms. Combustor residence times
  have decreased (currently around 5 ms) as a result of efforts to reduce NO<span class="subscript">x</span>,
  and the time the exhaust gases spend within the turbine and nozzle can thus
  be longer than that in the combustor. At the engine exit, the temperatures and
  pressures typically range from 200-600 K and 0.02-0.1 MPa, respectively, depending
  on the particular engine technology and the operating conditions. Note that
  some of the temperature change within the turbine results from the addition
  of cooling air, as discussed above. </p>
<p>Significant variations around the baseline, one-dimensional flow conditions
  described above exist because of spatial and temporal flow nonuniformities at
  the combustor exit and throughout the turbine. There are many reasons for this
  nonuniformity: Combustion turbulence, the combustor exit temperature profile
  needed to maintain turbine blade life, fuel injector-induced hot spots, introduction
  of cooling flows, and viscous boundary layers and wakes. Together these effects
  lead to turbine inlet conditions-which may vary locally at any instant in time-between
  those associated with combustor inlet conditions and those resulting from stoichiometric
  combustion.</p>
<p>Downstream of the combustor-in the turbine and exhaust nozzle-the evolution
  of any particular species within the turbine and exhaust nozzle generally depends
  on local temperature and pressure, concentrations of other species, and variations
  of these parameters over time. The multitude of unsteady three-dimensional fluid
  mechanical effects and the large number of chemical species that interact with
  one another make this region a complex physical and chemical system. A full
  understanding and prediction of its behavior has not yet been attained.</p>
<p>Chemical models developed for application to the post-combustion expansion
  process must apply to a wide range of flow parameters, as discussed previously
  (Miake-Lye et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1996; Lukachko et al., 1998). The availability
  of kinetic data applicable to the entire post-combustion range is limited because
  little research has spanned the wide gap in parameters between combustor and
  atmospheric conditions for many of the relevant reactions. An example of a chemical
  mechanism currently employed (Lukachko et al., 1998) consists of 25 species
  coupled through 74 reactions representing contributions from gaseous SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O, NOy,
  HO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and COx chemistry (Westley et al., 1983; Tsang and Hampson, 1986; Tsang
  and Herron, 1991; DeMore et al., 1994; Yetter et al., 1995). Because of gaps
  in the kinetic data, interpolation of available rates introduces uncertainties
  into current model results.</p>
<p>Beyond limitations in the range of applicability of basic kinetic data for
  identified reactions, the overall kinetic mechanism has yet to be validated
  against experimental data. Thus, the kinetic mechanism may not be complete,
  and missing mechanisms have yet to be positively identified. In particular,
  heterogeneous processes (e.g., involving soot and volatile particles) have not
  been adequately addressed by current models or measurements (see <a href="031.htm">Chapter
  3</a>). In addition, recent in-flight (Fahey et al., 1995b; Hanisco et al.,
  1997; Anderson et al., 1998; Hagen et al., 1998; Miake-Lye et al., 1998; Pueschel
  et al. 1998) and engine test cell measurements (Wey et al., 1998) have indicated
  that additional SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O oxidation is occurring that cannot be explained by SO<span class="subscript">x</span>O reactions
  currently accounted for in mechanisms used to date.</p>
