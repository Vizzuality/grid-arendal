<h3>8.3.3. Intermodality </h3>
<p>This section compares CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions from various transport modes. Only CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  emissions are discussed, primarily because other pollutant emissions are not
  comparable at all altitudes. Climate forcing from CO<span class="subscript">2</span> is independent of the
  altitude and geographical location of its release. Potential atmospheric effects
  of other gaseous particle emissions from aircraft will likely depend on where
  and when they occur. For example, the potential climate forcing and ozone perturbation
  effects of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emitted at altitude will be significantly different from the
  effects of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emitted by ground transport sources. Finally, substituting other
  transport modes for air transport can have environmental impacts on, for example,
  local air quality and noise exposure (which are outside the scope of this report).
</p>
<h4><a name="8331"></a>8.3.3.1. Introduction </h4>
<p>Emissions of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> from all transport sectors currently account for about 22%
  of all global emissions of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> from fossil fuel use (IPCC, 1996a). In 1990,
  aviation was responsible for about 12% of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions from the transport sector
  (see <a href="125.htm#img82">Figure 8-2</a>) (Faiz et al., 1996; IPCC, 1996b;
  OECD, 1997a,b). Regional variations also occur, as shown in <a href="125.htm#img83">Figure
  8-3</a> for North America. Consequently, aviation is currently responsible for
  about 2% of total global emissions of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> from the use of fossil fuels (Sprinkle
  and Macleod, 1993; WMO, 1995; Gardner et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Civil aviation can be divided into domestic and international flights, and
  their respective levels of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions can be determined. Balashov and Smith
  (1992) provided an estimate of this breakdown (see <a href="125.htm#tab85">Table
  8-5</a>). </p>
<p><a href="130.htm">Chapter 9</a> provides a detailed assessment of the future
  growth of the aviation industry, fleet scenarios, and projected fuel burn. </p>
<p>Rail and other forms of transport, such as bus or motorcar, have been suggested
  as substitutes for short-haul air travel (there is little alternative for longer
  distances). Flight stages of 800 km or less are estimated to represent only
  about 15-20% of all scheduled passenger operations (expressed in terms of available
  seat-km), according to an estimate provided by the ICAO Secretariat based on
  an analysis of 1996 airline schedules. Bearing in mind that a significant proportion
  of passenger journeys include more than one flight stage and that some short-haul
  flights bypass physical obstacles such as water, mountains, or inadequate ground
  infrastructure, the potential scope for replacing air transport with other modes
  seems unlikely to exceed about 10%. </p>
<p>Fare, trip time, and frequency of service rather than environmental considerations
  influence the choice a passenger makes for a particular mode of transport. A
  paper presented to a European Air Traffic Forecasting Forum (ECAC, 1996) estimates
  that "...even under favorable assumptions for rail, less than 10% of the European
  air passengers could be substituted by high-speed train." </p>
<h4><a name="8332"></a>8.3.3.2. Comparison of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Different
  Forms of Passenger Transport </h4>
<p><a href="125.htm#img84">Figure 8-4</a> compares CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions from major passenger
  transport modes. The wide ranges in CO<span class="subscript">2</span> intensity of passenger transport reflect
  many differences between countries and regions, including the availability of
  renewable and nuclear energy, the extent of road and rail infrastructure, and
  culture. For example, in the United States, greater importance is placed on
  aircraft and automobile modes of travel than on rail. The automobile mode serves
  mainly shorter urban and commuter needs, whereas aircraft serve longer intercity
  needs. This pattern is illustrated by the number of domestic flights-more than
  five times the number of international flights-which demonstrates greater U.S.
  dependence on short-haul aviation than in other geographic regions. In addition,
  U.S. cars and light trucks tend to be higher emitters because of increased vehicle
  and engine size (right of the range shown in <a href="125.htm#img84">Figure
  8-4</a>). </p>

  </table>
<p>Care must be taken in interpreting such data to appreciate underlying assumptions
  and statistics from which they have been drawn. The load factor of transportation
  modes is critical to the analysis. Car occupancy, in particular, can vary between
  1 and 4. For example, in Europe the average is 1.65 (Centre for Energy Conservation
  and Environmental Technology, 1997b), but in the United States this value is
  generally less than 1.2 (Institute of the Association for Commuter Transportation,
  1997)-which implies a significant margin in specific emissions (per passenger-km)
  relative to average occupancy. Occupancy levels for air, rail, and bus also
  vary significantly, but because of commercial pressures they are more likely
  to operate at higher levels than private road vehicles. European scheduled airlines
  typically operate at a load factor of about 70% (AEA, 1997) and charter airlines
  at about 90%. These figures are comparable to those in the United States, where
  in 1996 the average passenger load factor ranged from 48.6 to 75.4% for various
  passenger aircraft types and was 69.4% for all air carrier aircraft types (Bureau
  of Transportation Statistics, 1997). </p>
<p>Energy consumption and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions from electrically powered vehicles, particularly
  trains, are very dependent on the mode of electrical power generation. In countries
  that have a large dependency on hydroelectric or nuclear power generation, emission
  of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> per passenger-km by rail may be very low (<a href="125.htm#img84">Figure
  8-4</a>). Conversely, emissions of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> per passenger-km from high-speed locomotives
  with power derived from coal-fired electricity are considerably higher. In the
  case of aviation, flight distance is very important. On a short flight (250
  km), energy consumption and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions are significantly higher than they
  are for medium- or long-haul flights (see Figures <a href="125.htm#img84">8-4</a>
  and <a href="126.htm#img85">8-5</a>), because a greater proportion of the flight
  is at take-off power (with a relatively higher fuel consumption). Also, available
  data do not differentiate between aviation fuel used for passenger transport
  and that for freight. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
  (OECD) has calculated that passengers roughly account for 71% of the load carried
  (OECD, 1997a), although on short-haul routes freight may account for less than
  10% of the weight (Centre for Energy Conservation and Environmental Technology,
  1997b). </p>

  Prognos AG, 1995; Centre for Energy Conservation and Environmental Technology,

  long-haul aircraft (e.g., B747-400), are significantly more fuel efficient and
  emit less CO<span class="subscript">2</span> per passenger-km than older aircraft (e.g., DC-10). Over short-haul
  routes, advanced turboprops (ATP) emit about 20% less CO<span class="subscript">2</span> (as carbon) per passenger-km

<h4><a name="8333"></a>8.3.3.3. Comparison of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Different
  Forms of Freight Transport </h4>
<p><a href="126.htm#img86">Figure 8-6</a> provides a comparison of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions
  from major freight transport modes. In terms of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> (g C per tonne-km), aviation
  emits 1 to 2 orders of magnitude more carbon than other forms of transport.
  Cost and weight limitations do not allow aircraft to compete in the transport
  of heavy goods. For perishable freight and high-value goods, however, there
  may be no other suitable form of transportation. </p>
<p>Freight may be carried to improve capacity utilization on combination freight-passenger
  aircraft or passenger aircraft with appropriate space. This approach improves
  efficiencies, though such improvements are not necessarily reflected in all
  statistics. </p>

<p>The amount of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emitted per passenger-km for different modes of transport
  is very dependent on the type of aircraft, train, or car and on the load factor.
  Typical CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions for air transport are in the range of 30 to 110 g C per
  passenger-km, which is comparable with passengers travelling by car or light
  truck. Emission of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> per passenger-km from bus or coach transport is significantly
  lower (< 20 g C per passenger-km). For rail travel, CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions per passenger-km
  depend on several factors, such as source of primary energy, type of locomotive,
  and load factor; emissions vary between < 5 and 50 g C per passenger-km. </p>
