<!-- #BeginEditable "Page_Content_Here" --> <h4>9.4.1.2. FESG Technology Projections</h4>
<p>Calculations of fuel burned and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions produced by the 2050 scheduled
  fleet were made by applying projections of overall improvement in fleet fuel
  efficiency and emission characteristics to regional traffic flows and summing
  the results. These projections were created from technology-level estimates
  for new aircraft over time made by a working group of the International Coordinating
  Council of Aerospace Industries Associations (ICCAIA) (Sutkus, 1997); they are
  discussed in <a href="103.htm#755">Section 7.5.5</a>. A "fleet rollover" model
  was used to project a fleet average fuel efficiency trend, using characteristics
  of the present-day fleet and traffic demand from the FESG scenarios (Greene
  and Meisenheimer, 1997). The ICCAIA projections were made for two technology
  scenarios. The first scenario assumes that fuel efficiency and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reduction
  will be considered in the design of future aircraft in a manner similar to the
  current design philosophy. The second technology scenario assumes a more aggressive
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reduction design strategy that will result in smaller improvements in fuel
  efficiency. The assumptions associated with the two technology scenarios are
  given in <a href="138.htm#tab911">Table 9-11</a>. The basis for projections
  of aircraft emissions made by FESG for the year 2050 was the 3-D NASA emissions
  scenarios for the year 2015 discussed in <a href="135.htm">Section 9.3.2</a>.
  The NASA 2015 emissions inventory was factored on the basis of the product of
  the ratios of regional traffic (as departures), fleet fuel efficiency, and fleet
  EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) as calculated for 2050 over the same values in 2015. For all flights
  in a given region: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>NO<span class="subscript">x</span> Emissions<span class="subscript">2050</span> 
    = NO<span class="subscript">x</span> Emissions<span class="subscript">2015</span> 
    <br>
    (regional traffic<span class="subscript">2050</span>/ regional traffic<span class="subscript">2015</span>) 
    <br>
    (fleet fuel efficiency<span class="subscript">2050</span>/ fleet fuel efficiency<span class="subscript">2015</span>) 
    <br>
    (fleet EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)<span class="subscript">2050</span>/ 
    fleet EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)<span class="subscript">2015</span>) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="138.htm#img918">Figure 9-18</a> shows the trend for average new production
  and fleet average fuel efficiency as a function of time, derived from ICCAIA
  inputs and the fleet rollover model for the FESG high-demand traffic growth
  scenario. The average NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission index for the scheduled fleet over the same
  time period is shown in <a href="138.htm#img919">Figure 9-19</a>. The 2050 fleet
  average values used in the calculation of emissions from scheduled traffic as
  well as the baseline 2015 value are given in <a href="138.htm#tab912">Table
  9-12</a> (Sutkus, 1997). Fleet fuel efficiency is predicted to improve by about
  30% between 2015 and 2050. Traffic in the FSU and the People's Republic of China
  has not historically been reported in airline schedule databases such as the
  OAG. Fuel burned and emissions from aviation in these regions were estimated
  individually and projected to 2015 (Mortlock and Van Alystyne, 1998), then extended
  to 2050 (CAEP/4-FESG, 1998).</p>
<h4><a name="9413"></a>9.4.1.3. FESG Emissions Scenario Results</h4>
<p>Results of calculations of fuel burned and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions for the year 2050
  based on the long-term scenarios described above are given in <a href="138.htm#tab913">Table
  9-13</a>. The FESG complete scenarios are identified below and in the remainder
  of this chapter by combining the demand scenario (e.g., Fa) with the technology
  scenario number (e.g., Fa1, Fe2). </p>
<h3><a name="942"></a>9.4.2. DTI 2050 Scenarios</h3>
<p>The DTI projection for air traffic and emissions for 2050 (Newton and Falk,
  1997) has been developed from the DTI traffic and fleet forecast demand model,
  in conjunction with data from the ANCAT/EC2 inventory. The forecast model was
  developed from DTI's global and regional traffic forecast models for passenger
  and freight traffic. Fuel consumption trends were estimated with a fleet fuel
  efficiency model, and fleet emissions performance were estimated on the basis
  of assumed regulatory change. Finally, appropriate fuel and emissions factors
  were calculated to estimate 2050 figures from the base year; these factors were
  then applied to the 1992 ANCAT/EC2 emissions inventory to produce gridded results
  for the 2050 scenario.<a name="tab914"></a></p>

<p>The DTI model relates air traffic demand in RPKs with regional and global economic
  performance as reflected in GDP trends, as was the case with the ANCAT/EC2 2015
  forecast. Generally, a load factor of 70% is assumed to estimate ASKs (capacity)
  from traffic demand. Long-term traffic demand is also assumed to be modified
  by the same assumptions on fares pricing, market maturity, and so forth that
  the ANCAT/EC2 2015 forecast used. Capacity estimates are converted to fuel consumption
  estimates by using the concept of traffic efficiency as described in <a href="135.htm">Section
  9.3.2</a> and a fuel efficiency trend for the scenario period. Model coverage
  includes all global aviation markets, but separate fuel consumption estimates
  are made for freight and for the FSU on the basis of aligning growth with global
  civil passenger market trends. </p>
<p>The scenario modeled for 2050 assumes that sufficient aviation infrastructure
  would be available to accommodate the forecast increase in traffic. No new city
  pairs are introduced during the scenario period, and aircraft flight profiles
  remain unaltered from the present day; altitude, speed, and method of operation
  are assumed to be the same as present-day values, even for larger aircraft types
  (600+ seats) that are assumed to enter service beginning in about 2005. All
  traffic is assumed to be carried by a subsonic aircraft fleet (i.e., no HSCT
  would be operating by 2050). The model forecasts traffic growth to be positive
  throughout the scenario, but growth rate declines during the period. Decadal
  capacity growth rates-actual and forecast-are given in <a href="139.htm#tab914">Table
  9-14</a>. The traffic forecast includes civil and freight operations as well
  as civil charter and business jet traffic but excludes military aviation activity
  and possible future supersonic operations. </p>
<p>Fuel usage was determined for the base year fleet from the capacity offered
  in that year (ASKs) and the fleet's traffic efficiency (ASK per kg fuel). A
  fuel efficiency trend suggested by Greene (1992) and modified by DTI was included
  as a scenario parameter, as given in <a href="139.htm#tab915">Table 9-15</a>.

<p>The traffic efficiency of the fleet over the scenario period was estimated
  to range from 30 ASK kg<sup>-1</sup> in the base year 1992 to 48 ASK kg<sup>-1</sup> in 2050 (a 60%
  improvement). This estimate was based on the performance of existing aircraft
  types and forecasts of the type and number of aircraft (categorized by seat
  band and technology level) that might be flying in 2050. Future aircraft types
  included size developments to 799 seats. </p>
<p>A major scenario element was the NO<span class="subscript">x</span> reduction technology assumption. Current
  technology will allow engines to achieve reductions of around 30% below the
  current certification level (CAEP/2 standards). The basis of the technology
  scenario was that NO<span class="subscript">x</span> regulations would be made considerably more stringent
  than today and that the manufacturing industry would develop appropriate technology
  solutions. This development was modeled by assuming that from 1992: </p>
<ul>
  <li> CAEP/2 certification standard applies to all new production from 2000</li>
  <li> 30% reduction in ICAO recommended limits from CAEP/2 in 2005 </li>
  <li> 60% reduction from CAEP/2 phased in equally over 8 years from 2035. </li>
</ul>
<p>With a fleet development trend determined by the capacity forecast, the rate
  of introduction of the scenario above implies a global fleet emissions index
  trend that is as compatible with the relatively modest fuel efficiency assumption
  given in <a href="139.htm#tab916">Table 9-16</a>. The fleet EI(NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) of 7.0 implies
  widespread use of ultra-low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> technology (<a href="099.htm">Section 7.5</a>).
  The total calculated fuel burned and emissions for 2050 under the DTI/ANCAT
  scenario are given in <a href="139.htm#tab917">Table 9-17</a>.</p>
