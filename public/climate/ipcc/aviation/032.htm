<H2><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b></H2>
<p>Current aircraft engines emit aerosol particles and gaseous aerosol precursors
  into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere that may affect air chemistry
  and climate. Aircraft engines also directly emit soot and metal particles. Liquid
  aerosol precursors include water vapor, oxidized sulfur in various forms, chemi-ions
  (charged molecules), nitrogen oxides, and unburned hydrocarbons. </p>
<p>Large numbers (about 1017/kg fuel) of small (radius 1 to 10 nm) volatile particles
  are formed in the exhaust plumes of cruising aircraft, as shown by in situ observations
  and model calculations. These new particles initially form from sulfuric acid,
  chemi-ions, and water vapor; they grow in size by coagulation and uptake of
  water vapor and other condensable gases. The conversion fraction of fuel sulfur
  to sulfuric acid in the young plume is inferred to be likely in the range of
  0.4 to about 20%. </p>
<p>Subsonic aircraft emissions near the tropopause at northern mid-latitudes are
  a significant source of soot mass and sulfate aerosol surface area density and
  number concentration, according to existing measurements and model results.
  Aircraft generate far less aerosol than that emitted and produced at the Earth's
  surface or by strong volcanic eruptions. Aircraft emissions injected directly
  at 9- to 12-km altitudes are more important than similar surface emissions because
  of longer atmospheric residence times in the upper troposphere. The impact of
  present aircraft emissions on the formation of polar stratospheric clouds is
  much smaller than what is expected for a projected fleet of supersonic aircraft.
</p>
<p>Regional enhancements in concentrations of aircraft-produced aerosol have been
  observed near air traffic corridors. Global changes in sulfate aerosol properties
  at subsonic air traffic altitudes were small over the past few decades. The
  contribution of aircraft emissions to changes or possible trends in these regions
  is difficult to determine because of the large variability of natural sources.
</p>
<p>Contrails are visible line clouds that form behind aircraft flying in sufficiently
  cold air as a result of water vapor emissions. Contrail formation can be accurately
  predicted for given atmospheric temperature and humidity conditions. In the
  exhaust, water droplets form on soot and sulfuric acid particles, then freeze
  to form contrail particles. Models suggest that contrails would also form without
  soot and sulfur emissions by activation and freezing of background particles.
  Increasing fuel sulfur content results in more and smaller ice particles. In
  the future, aircraft with more fuel-efficient engines will produce lower exhaust
  temperatures for the same concentration of emitted water vapor, hence will tend
  to cause contrails at higher ambient temperatures and over a larger altitude
  range. </p>
<p>Persistent contrails often develop into more extensive contrail cirrus in ice-supersaturated
  air masses. Ice particles in such persistent contrails grow by uptake of water
  vapor from the surrounding air. The area of the Earth covered by persistent
  contrails is controlled by the global extent of ice-supersaturated air masses
  and the number of aircraft flights in those air masses. Present contrail cover
  will increase further as air traffic increases. The properties of persistent
  contrails depend on the aerosol formed in exhaust plumes. Regions of ice-supersaturation
  vary with time and location and are estimated to cover an average of 10 to 20%
  of the Earth's surface at mid-latitudes. Ice-supersaturation in these regions
  is often too small to allow cirrus to form naturally, so aircraft act as a trigger
  to form cirrus clouds. </p>
<p>The mean coverage of line-shaped contrails is currently greatest over the United
  States of America, Europe, and the North Atlantic; it amounts to 0.5% on average
  over central Europe during the daytime. The mean global linear contrail coverage
  represents the minimum change in cirrus cloud coverage from air traffic; its
  present value is estimated to be 0.1% (possibly 0.02 to 0.2%). </p>
<p>Aviation-induced aerosol present in exhaust plumes and accumulated in the background
  atmosphere may indirectly affect cirrus cloud cover or other cloud properties
  throughout the atmosphere. Observations and models are not yet sufficient to
  quantify the aerosol impact on cirrus cloud properties. </p>
<p>Satellite and surface-based observations of seasonal and decadal changes in
  cirrus cover and frequency in main air traffic regions suggest a possible relationship
  between air traffic and cirrus formation. Cirrus changes in main air traffic
  regions suggest global cirrus cover increases of up to 0.2% of the Earth's surface
  since the beginning of jet aviation, in addition to the 0.1% cover by line-shaped
  contrails. Observed cirrus cover changes have not been conclusively attributed
  to aircraft emissions or to other causes. </p>
<p>Contrails cause a positive mean radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere.
  They reduce both the solar radiation reaching the surface and the amount of
  longwave radiation leaving the Earth to space. Contrails reduce the daily temperature
  range at the surface and cause a heating of the troposphere, especially over
  warm and bright surfaces. The radiative effects of contrails depend mainly on
  their coverage and optical depth. </p>
<p>For an estimated mean global linear-contrail cover of 0.1% of the Earth's surface
  and contrail optical depth of 0.3, radiative forcing is computed to be 0.02
  W m<sup>-2</sup>, with a maximum value of 0.7 W m<sup>-2</sup> over parts of Europe and the United
  States of America. Radiative forcing by linear contrails is uncertain by a factor
  of about 3 to 4 (range from 0.005 to 0.06 W m<sup>-2</sup>), reflecting uncertainties in
  contrail cover (x 2) and contrail mean optical depth (x 3). </p>
<p>In the current atmosphere, the direct radiative forcing of accumulated aircraft-induced
  aerosol is smaller than that of contrails. The optical depth of aircraft-induced
  aerosol is less than 0.0004 in the zonal mean and is much smaller than that
  of stratospheric aerosol from large volcanic eruptions or mean tropospheric
  aerosol abundances. </p>
<p>Indirect radiative forcing is caused by aviation-induced cirrus that is produced
  in addition to line-shaped contrail cirrus. This forcing is likely positive
  and may be larger than that from line-shaped contrails. Radiative forcing from
  additional cirrus may be as large as 0.04 W m<sup>-2</sup> in 1992. Indirect forcing from
  other cloud effects has not yet been determined and may be either positive or
  negative. </p>
<p>In the future, contrail cloudiness and radiative forcing are expected to increase
  more strongly than global aviation fuel consumption because air traffic is expected
  to increase mainly in the upper troposphere, where contrails form preferentially,
  and because aircraft will be equipped with more fuel-efficient engines. More
  efficient engines will cause contrails to occur more frequently and over a larger
  altitude range for the same amount of air traffic. For the threefold increase
  in fuel consumption calculated for a 2050 scenario (Fa1), a fivefold increase
  in contrail cover and a sixfold increase in radiative forcing are expected.
  The contrail cover would increase even more strongly if the number of cruising
  aircraft increases more than their fuel consumption. For other 2050 scenarios
  (Fc1 and Fe1), the expected cirrus cover increases by factors of 3 and 9, respectively,
  compared to 1992. Higher cruise altitudes will increase contrail cover in the
  subtropics; lower cruise altitudes will increase contrail cover in polar regions.
  Future climate changes may cause further changes in expected aircraft-induced
  cirrus cover. </p>
<p>The future aerosol impact of aviation will increase with fuel consumption.
  The trends depend on future fuel-sulfur content, engine soot emissions, and
  the efficiency with which fuel sulfur is transformed into aerosol behind the
  aircraft. </p>
<p>Aerosol microphysical and chemical processes are similar in subsonic and supersonic
  aircraft plumes. Aerosol properties will differ because soot emission levels,
  aerosol formation potential, and plume dilution properties vary with engine
  type and atmospheric conditions at cruise altitudes. Significant increases in
  stratospheric aerosol are expected for the operation of a large fleet of supersonic
  aircraft, at least for non-volcanic periods.</p>
