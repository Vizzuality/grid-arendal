<h1>Case Study 9</h1>
<p> <b>Bamboo Fibre Reinforced Cement Board for Carbon Sequestration</b><br>

<p><b>Summary </b><br>
  Cement board has become a standard construction material in the tropics. The 
  mixing of cement with mineral fibres or synthetic substitutes has evolved into 
  a major industry. Taiheyo Cement, the second largest cement producer in the 
  world, invested in a special research programme in association with the Zero 
  Emissions programme to substitute the mineral and synthetic fibres with natural 
  ones. This has now been successfully implemented.</p>
<p>The cement industry is under tremendous pressure to improve its carbon dioxide 
  balance. The massive production has been partly reduced and marginally offset 
  with reforestation programmes, but the overall balance remains unfavourable. 
  The search for natural fibres, which sequester carbon dioxide, was considered 
  a practical option. Scientists were sceptical, however, since the mixing of 
  organic material (bamboo fibres) with inorganic (cement) has always been difficult. 
  The residual sugars from organic material inhibit the crystallisation of cement, 
  reducing the quality and price performance. </p>
<p><b>Approach</b><br>
  Researchers identified bamboo-specific fungi that would eliminate all sugars 
  after crushing the bamboo. This process saves water and offers a good quality 
  fibre with no residual sugars. The blending of 50% cement with 50% bamboo fibres 
  reverses the carbon dioxide balance. Since the cement board has an expected 
  life of 30 years, the fast growing species like Bambusa vulgaris offers a unique 
  opportunity for the construction industry to adhere to the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p>The research was undertaken in Japan, but the first pilot plant was located 
  in Java, Indonesia, just one hour outside Jakarta. The proximity to a cheap 
  and abundant supply of bamboo is critical in the financial viability of the 
  operation. On the basis of this first experience, an improved version of the 
  production technology has been obtained. A second factory is now being planned 
  in Manizales, Colombia, the centre of bamboo forests in Latin America. This 
  permits the fast and pragmatic transfer of technologies developed in Japan to 
  be fine-tuned in Indonesia and then transferred to Latin America.</p>
<p><b>Impacts</b><br>
  The use of bamboo fibre has a positive effect on the carbon balance, but it 
  also changes the look of the city. Whereas asbestos or synthetic fibre cement 
  boards were strong, their grey look rendered the horizon of any city unattractive. 
  The wheat-yellow look of the bamboo fibre cement board favourably changes the 
  impression a city offers to the outside world. </p>
<p>Since there are some 1,300 species of bamboo and the material is abundant and 
  easy to grow, the use of bamboo fibre offers numerous benefits. Bamboo forests 
  are known to have a positive influence on the hydrobalance of a region, are 
  effectively used as a measure against soil erosion, and reinstate a natural 
  habitat that dominated the tropical highlands until agricultural and industrial 
  development began one hundred and fifty years ago. </p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  This programme demonstrates that there are unexpected opportunities for carbon 
  sequestration. These approaches require innovative biotechnologies such as the 
  effective use of sugar digesting fungi enzymes and the combination of organic 
  and inorganic materials. The programme of Taiheyo Cement has demonstrated that 
  this is not only feasible, it is commercially viable. And even better, the consumer 
  has access to a quality product that leaves a beautiful impression.</p>
