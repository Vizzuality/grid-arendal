<h3>2.2.3 Developing countries actions </h3>
<p><i>Assessment of local technology needs and meeting of local demands</i><br>
  Participatory development is now widely recognised as a way of achieving effective
  technology transfer at all levels of development endeavour. This has grown from
  a perceived need to move from donor driven technology transfer to national needs
  driven approaches. It can facilitate market transformation through the involvement
  of firms and consumers. Governments are the most direct and influential actors
  for promoting a favourable environment for participation among the private sector,
  public sector organisations, NGOs and grassroots organisations at regional and
  local levels. Practical experience with participation but the step towards mainstreaming
  in government and development agencies still has to be made. </p>
<p>Meeting local demands also includes examining what the social impacts of technology
  transfer will be and how negative impacts can be reduced. There is a particular
  need for developing guidelines for ensuring that technology transfer projects
  do not disempower or negatively influence weaker social groups in a society.
  Such guidelines could draw from guidelines on integrating gender issues in technology
  development.</p>
<p>Participatory development can thus achieve:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Better choices and identification of possibilities and opportunities in
    local systems </li>
  <li> Better commitment to projects which improves implementation and sustainability
  </li>
  <li> Opportunities to negotiate conflicts </li>
  <li> Empowerment- which raises awareness about the need for stakeholders to
    achieve solutions themselves.</li>
  <li> Access to additional resources for the project raised from the target project
    beneficiaries through payments, and time.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Property right issues and ownership</i><br>
  The experience in agriculture, forestry, and use of other natural resources
  has shown that the successful introduction of new technologies often depends
  on a recognition of the existing forms of ownership, or on taking steps to create
  an improved property rights regime. With an understanding of existing - legal
  and actual - forms of ownership, technologies or modified resource uses can
  be adapted to fit this existing system. If property issues are taken into account,
  those introducing new technologies or proposing modifications in land or resource
  use can be more assured of the support of the target populations or groups.</p>
<p><i><br>
  Appropriate R&amp;D programmes for adaptation of ESTs to own local conditions
  </i><br>
  Developing countries' R&amp;D efforts are often adaptive, following externally
  developed technology, suggesting the need for additional resources to develop
  indigenous innovative capacity. R&amp;D and the process of innovation are closely
  linked, but innovation has been found to fail at the level of capability - the
  ability to focus specific sets of resources in a particular way (e.g., financial
  management, marketing, understanding user needs, etc.) rather than because of
  inadequate resources or hardware. The process of dissemination depends closely
  on influencing key opinion formers, at government, industry, firm or community
  level.</p>
<p><i>Improved pathways for South-South transfer </i><br>
  Most technology transfer to date has passed along a North-South axis, and given
  financial constraints in many developing countries and CEITs this situation
  is likely to continue. However, creative means of using developed country bilateral
  aid, multilateral programmes and increased access to world capital markets may
  provide opportunities to increase South-South transfers. Enhancing South-South
  transfers is important, because developing countries may encounter challenges
  that are unlikely to be found in developed countries, but for which solutions
  exist in other developing countries. Initiatives to improve the pathways for
  South-South transfer could include: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Sharing of information regarding the performance of ESTs in developing
    countries;</li>
  <li> Joint R&amp;D and demonstration programmes;</li>
  <li> Opening markets for ESTs from other developing countries.</li>
</ul>
