  <font size="2">*Health benefits of mitigating technology are compared to existing
  technology. Note: Health benefits can be highly variable depending on the type
  of industry. Whenever there is a change in industry there is a change to occupational
  exposures and health risks, therefore, reference to specific occupational hazards
  are not addressed in this table.</font></div>
<p>While, reductions in GHG emissions are directed principally at achieving long-term
  global benefit by mitigating climate change, secondary health effects of mitigation
  technologies are likely to occur at a local level and more immediately. This
  has important implications for &quot;joint implementation&quot; and &quot;clean
  development mechanisms&quot;. Governments can thus act to optimise health as
  well as GHG emissions reduction in their populations.</p>
<p>Through the Clean Development Mechanism, investment in GHG mitigation strategies
  that promote more efficient or low-carbon energy generation can improve health
  in less developed countries. Fossil fuel combustion produces air pollutants
  that have both short- and long-term impacts on mortality and morbidity rates
  (Katsouyanni et al., 1997). The secondary health benefit of reducing air pollutant
  concentrations can be substantial, particularly for the impacts of particulates,
  nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide. For example, the Working Group on Public
  Health and Fossil Fuel Combustion (1997) estimated the global health benefit
  of reduced outdoor exposure to particulates as 700,000 fewer premature deaths
  per year by 2020 under a Kyoto-like mitigation scenario compared to a business-as-usual
  scenario. The authors emphasised that simplifying assumptions in the model precluded
  precise predictions of the number of avoidable deaths and that the estimate
  of avoided deaths is merely indicative of the approximate magnitude of the likely
  health benefits of the climate policy scenario. Moreover, comparisons of premature
  mortality are difficult to interpret across differing populations.</p>
<p>Some country-specific estimates of air pollution-related secondary benefits
  have also been undertaken. China is an important source of GHG emissions and
  already suffers a high burden of ill health due to air pollution (WRI, 1998).
  Reductions in GHGs emissions would have large benefits for the Chinese population
  through reductions in indoor air pollution (Wang and Smith, 1999a,b). Several
  studies have evaluated other secondary health benefits associated with air pollution
  reduction - such as the direct costs of health services used (e.g., Aaheimet
  al., 1997); or costing lives lost or years-of-life lost (e.g., Ontario Medical
  Association, 1998; see also IPCC TAR Working Group III (Chapter 9), forthcoming).</p>
<p>The degree of health benefit depends markedly on the particular mitigation
  scenario that is used in the assessment (Wang and Smith, 1999a). Furthermore,
  in countries with high levels of air pollution, mitigation strategies will have
  a greater health benefit per unit GHG emission reduction than in those countries
  with low levels of air pollution. The degree of health benefit also depends
  on the current source of energy and the proposed alternative. Switching from
  natural gas power plants to wind or solar power sources has little near-term
  health benefit because gas burns relatively cleanly. Reductions in sectors where
  emissions occur near human activities, e.g., in transport and household/domestic
  sectors, will have more near-term health benefit per unit GHG reduction than
  in other sectors (see <a href="274.htm#b141">Box 14.1</a>).</p>

    <td> Old technologies using traditional non-fossil fuels produce large health-damaging
      exposures and significant greenhouse-gas emissions. Simple household stoves,
      which burn mainly biomass fuels (wood, dung, crop residues), provide cooking
      and heating needs for nearly half the world's households. A large fraction
      of the carbon in the fuel is diverted into airborne products of incomplete
      combustion, e.g., particulates, CH4, CO, and hundreds of organic compounds.
      More than two million premature deaths per year could be attributed globally
      to the indoor air pollution caused by household solid fuels (WHO, 1997b).
      Although the total health-damaging emissions of such stoves are less than
      the emissions in cities, the exposures are much higher, because the pollutants
      are released indoors at the times and places where people are (Smith et
      al., 1999). The fraction of HDP that reaches people's breathing zones can
      vary by 2-3 orders of magnitude depending on where emissions occur (Smith,
      1995).</td>

<p>The adverse impacts on health of mitigation technologies must also be considered.
  An increased demand for hydropower may increase the building of large dams;
  yet, there has been growing concern about the social and health impacts of large
  hydropower projects (Goodland, 1997). In 1998, a World Commission on Dams was
  set up by the World Bank and the World Conservation Union to set new international
  guidelines. Large water projects in tropical and sub-tropical countries have
  resulted in increases in the prevalence of schistosomiasis and other diseases,
  loss of food security and social problems that negatively influence health (Oomen
  et al., 1994; Brantly and Ramsey, 1998; Lerer and Scudder, 1999). Social impacts
  include the dislocation of the rural population living in the area to be inundated;
  over 40 million people are estimated to have been displaced by dam projects
  over the past 10 years (Cernea, 1996). Resettled families lose homes, land,
  food sources and employment. Communities that host the resettlers face increased
  population densities, which places severe pressure on natural resources and
  water and sanitation infrastructure. Reduction of fish populations downstream
  has affected indigenous populations that rely on fish as their main source of
  animal protein. For example, downstream of the Tucurui dam, Brazil, affected
  communities along the Tocantins River complained that seven fish species have
  almost disappeared (Confalonieri, personal communication, 1998). The health
  impact of dams may also include increases in the transmission of vector-borne
  diseases. For example, an increase in the population of mosquito vectors of
  malaria due to the availability of more breeding sites has been observed at
  the Tucurui dam (Tadei, 1993).</p>
<p>Small-scale hydroelectric power generation schemes rarely use dams, but instead
  collect water from smaller structure such as weirs. Such schemes may also have
  undesirable local effects, such as providing vector breeding sites (Ghebreyesus
  et al., 1999), although small-scale dams are generally less environmentally
  damaging than are large-scale projects. The most promising application of small-scale
  hydropower appears to be in isolated communities, to provide electricity for
  limited uses (e.g., lighting, communications, refrigeration) when there is no
  other feasible means of providing a continuous supply. In these conditions hydro
  schemes may have positive effects (including benefits for public health such
  as better vaccine storage, telemedicine, education) that outweigh relatively
  minor, local environmental and health impacts (EECA, 1996).</p>
<p>The evaluation and full-cost accounting of GHG mitigation technologies should
  include an assessment of the health impacts of these technologies. Regrettably,
  although environmental health impact assessments are an important part of environmental
  impact assessment, they are often omitted and are all too rarely a prime determinant
  of the ultimate policy decision. Lack of awareness of long-term objectives and
  of a political will to value human well-being and health over material gain
  contribute to this problem (Last, 1997).</p>
