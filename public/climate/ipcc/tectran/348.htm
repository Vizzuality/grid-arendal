<h1>Case Study 20</h1>
<p> <b>Caribbean Planning for Adaptation to Global Climate Change (CPACC): Design
  and Establishment of Sea-Level/Climate Monitoring Network</b><br>
  Claudio R. Volont&eacute;<br>
  Organisation of American States<br>
  <br>
  <b>Keywords</b>: sea-level, monitoring, project implementation, adaptation<br>
  <br>
  <b>Summary</b><br>
  CPACC's overall objective is to support twelve Caribbean countries to cope with
  potential impacts of global climate change, particularly sea-level rise, through
  vulnerability assessment, adaptation planning, and capacity building. The Organisation
  of American States (OAS) is CPACC's executing agency and recipient of the US$6.7
  million grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) through the World Bank
  (as the GEF implementing agency). Funds are transferred to the Regional Project
  Implementation Unit (RPIU) established at the University of the West Indies
  Centre for Environment and Development (UWICED), Barbados, to coordinate and
  manage project activities at the regional level. All participating countries
  have established National Implementation Coordinating Units (NICUs) that facilitate
  project implementation at the national level. The project became effective on
  April 1997 for a four-year implementation period.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Approach</b><br>
  Adaptation to climate change is achieved through a regional approach to strengthen
  technical and institutional capacity of national and regional institutions.
  These capacities include: (i) monitoring and analysis of climate and sea-level
  dynamics and trends to determine potential impacts of global climate change;
  (ii) identifying areas vulnerable to climate change and sea-level rise; and
  (iii) developing an integrated management and planning framework for cost-effective
  responses and adaptations, as well as policy options and instruments to impacts
  of climate change on coastal areas.<br>
  <br>
  Design and establishment of Sea-Level/Climate Monitoring Network is one of 9
  components of the CPACC programme. The overall objectives of this component
  are to establish a state-of-the-art telemetry sea-level and meteorological monitoring
  network in countries participating in CPACC, and to develop the region's capacity
  to take charge of the network over the course of the project. The network provides
  data to be used for analysis and prediction of oceanographic and atmospheric
  phenomena related to sea level change and global warning. These stations comply
  with the minimum standards of the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS)
  network. The capacity of data acquisition, analysis, archiving and dissemination
  is the responsibility of the Caribbean Meteorological Institute (CMI) in Barbados.
  The Institute of Marine Affairs (IMA) in Trinidad and Tobago acts as a regional
  support for archiving and disseminating sea-level data. A training and technology
  transfer programme has been designed to ensure that participating regional and
  national institutions acquire the capacity to coordinate the network, support
  data analysis and dissemination and maintain its operational integrity during
  and after the project.<br>
  <b><br>
  Parties to the project</b><br>
  Parties to the project include the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund (GEF),
  the General Secretariat/Organisation of American States (GS/OAS), RPIU at University
  of the West Indies Centre for Environment and Development (UWICED), Meteorological
  and Land Survey Offices of 12 participating countries, the Caribbean Meteorological
  Institute and Institute of Marine Affairs, and the US NOAA Coastal Survey Department
  and National Geodetic Survey Laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  Type of agreement</p>
<ul>
  <li> Legal agreement between GS/OAS and The World Bank.</li>
  <li> Technical cooperation agreement between GS/OAS and the University of the
    West Indies.</li>
  <li> Technical cooperation agreements between GS/OAS and 12 participating governments,
    two regional institutions (CMI and IMA) and US NOAA (specific for this component).</li>
  <li> CMI was designated as the lead regional agency for the implementation of
    this component. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Commercial considerations</b><br>
  Financial considerations (e.g., investment, operating costs, profitability):<br>
  The project receives 100% financing from the GEF. The OAS, UWICED, and national
  and regional institutions provide in kind contribution (staff, office space
  and equipment, etc.). The budget for Component 1 is US$811,500 for four years,
  divided in technical assistance/training (US$410,900), equipment (US$350,600)
  and maintenance/replacement trust fund at CMI (US$50,000). So far, mechanisms
  for cost recovery have not been developed.</p>
<p> <br>
  Risk considerations (e.g., investment, country, intellectual property issues):</p>
<ul>
  <li> Effective and efficient implementation due to the multiplicity of countries
    and institutions involved.</li>
  <li> Maintenance and operation by national institutions, although the equipment
    selected is designed to provide high quality continuous data with minimal
    maintenance.</li>
  <li> Safety of equipment from vandalism and natural hazards.</li>
  <li> Project sustainability after GEF funding ends.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  It is clear that project ownership is a key element for implementation success.
  The extensive consultation effort during project preparation has paid off. Another
  key element of project success is that technology transfer should be accompanied
  with intensive training of local experts, both formally, through workshops,
  and informally, hands-on. Furthermore, the CPACC framework appears conducive
  for replication.<br>
