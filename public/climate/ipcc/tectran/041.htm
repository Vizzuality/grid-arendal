<h1>3.4 Technology Transfer under the UNFCCC Agreements</h1>
<p>As noted in the introduction to this chapter, the UNFCCC represents a global
  accord in which developing countries accept their need to be involved in global
  efforts to address climate change, and undertake the general provisions of Article
  4.1, in return for assistance with finance and technology transfer that are
  set out in later sections of this Article. Article 4.7, referred to earlier,
  bares this point out in some detail (see <a href="041.htm#b33">Box 3.3</a>).

      transfer -- UNFCCC</b></font></td>

    <td><b>Article 4.1.h</b> (all Parties taking into account their common but
      differentiated responsibilities ...shall): Promote and cooperate in the
      full, open and prompt exchange of relevant scientific, technological, technical,
      socio-economic and legal information related to the climate system and climate
      change, and to the economic and social consequences of various response
      strategies.
      <p><b>Article 4.3</b> The developed country Parties .. in Annex II .. shall
	also provide such financial resources, including for the transfer of technology,
	needed by the developing country Parties to meet their agreed full incremental
	costs of implementing measures that are covered by paragraphs 1 of this
	Article and that are agreed ... </p>
      <p><b>Article 4.4</b> (Annex II Parties) shall also assist the developing
	country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects
	of climate change in meeting the cost of adaptation to those adverse effects.
      </p>
      <p><b>Article 4.5</b>: The developed country Parties and other developed
	Parties included in Annex II shall take all practicable steps to promote,
	facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to,
	environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly
	developing country Parties, to enable them to implement the provisions
	of the Convention. In this process, the developed country Parties shall
	support the development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies
	of developing country Parties. Other Parties and organizations in a position
	to do so may also assist in facilitating the transfer of such technologies.</p>
      <p><b>Article 4.7</b> The extent to which developing country Parties will
	effectively implement their commitments under the Convention will depend
	on the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their
	commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer
	of technology &#133; </p>

<p>One important aspect of this was the financial mechanism. The GEF was entrusted
  with its operation, initially on an interim basis. Operating experience with
  the GEF and its role in financing the transfer of ESTs is discussed in <a href="092.htm">Chapter
  5</a> of this Report. </p>
<p>Until recently, the focus of the GEF has been primarily on mitigation of climate
  change, but following CoP3 and CoP4, adaptation has received increasing attention.
  However, major barriers to the international funding of adaptation activities
  remain to be overcome. The GEF Operational Strategy prescribes that activities
  need to have global benefits in order to be eligible for funding. Mitigation
  activities, aimed at reducing atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations, clearly
  have global benefits. For adaptation activities, on the other hand, it is difficult
  to imagine how global benefits can be produced. Adaptation takes place at the
  scale of an impacted system, which is regional at best, but mostly local.</p>
<p>At CoP4 in Buenos Aires, the decisions on the financial mechanism confirmed
  the Global Environmental Facility as an &quot;entity entrusted with operation
  of the financial mechanism of the Convention&quot; and broadened its scope.
  The mandate was broadened, with reference to the need for &quot;flexibility
  to respond to changing circumstances&quot;. Its funding scope was formally expanded
  to include more wide-ranging support for building up the capacity of developing
  countries to address climate change issues, including support for adaptation
  technologies and full funding of their Second National Communications. The decision
  also established guidelines for the review of the financial mechanism every
  four years. </p>
