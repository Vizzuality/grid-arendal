<h3>14.4.2 Intersectoral Adaptation Options</h3>
<p>Intersectoral technologies are those that involve collaboration between health
  and other sectors. Recent experiences with the control of emerging and resurging
  diseases, e.g., dengue, have shown that emergency responses by the health sector
  have limited success - usually because they are begun too late to have any effect.
  There is a need to think more broadly than the health sector for effective interventions
  for infectious disease threats (Pinheiro and Corber, 1997; Gubler, 1989).</p>
<p>Collaboration across research disciplines is essential. For example, the use
  of a hydrological soil moisture model to forecast Anopheles mosquito biting
  rates in Kenya was only possible because of collaboration between epidemiologists,
  entomologists and hydrologists (Patz et al., 1998). Barriers to global change
  research include: the lack of national strategic research plans; lack of communication
  between disciplines; single-discipline funding agencies that do not fund interdisciplinary
  research; the pressure of other existing health needs; and the lack of public
  concern, which would increase priority with decision-makers (CGCP, 1995). </p>
<p><i>Integrated Environmental Management</i><br>
  The environmental management of ecosystems upon which health depends (i.e.,
  freshwater resources, agricultural areas) should be improved. The incidence
  of certain water-borne and vector-borne infections can be reduced by several
  environmental measures. Experience with the WHO/FAO/UNEP/UNCHS Panel of Experts
  on Environmental Management (PEEM) has shown that early consultations between
  health and agricultural sectors can greatly reduce the burden of vector-borne
  diseases (e.g., malaria, schistosomiasis) in large-scale irrigation projects
  by appropriate adaptations in the management of irrigation water (FAO, 1987).
  Likewise, collaboration between oceanographers, marine biologists and fisheries
  experts should lead to the delineation of non-fishing zones on coral reefs,
  to maintain fish breeding sites and to provide sentinel sites for the undistorted
  monitoring of ocean warming effects.</p>
<p>Traditional public health interventions for water- and food-borne diseases,
  which focus on personal hygiene and food safety, have limited effectiveness.
  A broader approach would consider the interactions between climate, vegetation,
  agricultural practices and human activity. For example, some farming practices
  remove vegetation from hillsides and river banks, increasing run-off, leading
  in turn to more erosion and sedimentation, and the retention of encysted pathogens
  from livestock excrement. Ecological analysis can result in recommendations
  for the type, time and place of public health interventions, such as changes
  in management of water catchment areas, or targeting water treatment to cover
  high risk periods.</p>
<p>Strategies to control the invasion of climate-sensitive disease vector and
  pest species require intersectoral collaboration between the health, forestry,
  environment, and conservation sectors. Climate change is likely to amplify the
  challenge of pest control, as new ecological niches appear that may sustain
  exotic pathogens and disease vectors. The recent establishment of the Environmental
  Risk Management Authority (ERMA) in New Zealand is an example of such a strategy
  (Anon, 1996). As an evolutionarily-isolated island ecosystem New Zealand is
  particularly vulnerable to invading species (Leakey and Lewin, 1996). ERMA provides
  an integrated approach with a wide-ranging brief that includes regulation of
  importation, investigation of incidents and emergencies, and review of existing
  hazards. The Authority has formal links with many sectors, must consider public
  input from diverse interest groups, and reports directly to a senior Minister
  who holds both the Environment and Biosecurity portfolios.</p>
<p><i>Urban Planning</i><br>
  Within the next decade, more than half the world's population (more than 3.3
  billion people) will be living in cities (WRI, 1997). Rapid urbanisation has
  many adverse environmental and health consequences, and health inequalities
  between rich and poor are widest in cities of developing countries. Current
  strategies to reduce poverty and vulnerability to climate variability in urban
  environments will serve to enhance adaptation to the health impacts of climate
  change. Some examples are described below.</p>
<p>Natural Disasters: Land use planning can reduce vulnerability to weather disasters
  by maintaining strict control over any development in high-risk zones and to
  discourage human settlement in such zones. In addition, governments must ensure
  that buildings and the urban infrastructure are built to withstand extreme events.
  Populations in shanty settlements in developing countries are very vulnerable
  to climate variability, as structures are often flimsy and located on land subject
  to frequent flooding. Future projections of land-use changes indicate that in
  many countries the poorest population sectors will congregate increasingly on
  the land that is most vulnerable to the impacts of natural disasters. Therefore,
  these countries need to formulate national disaster-response strategies as part
  of their sustainable development planning.</p>
<p>Urban micro-climates: At the local scale, human activities alter the climate
  in cities principally by the &quot;heat island&quot; effect that increases temperatures
  and decreases precipitation. The heat island effect can be reduced by appropriate
  urban planning (Oke, 1997), including improved insulation of buildings and other
  design features that reduce heat load, planting trees, and selection of materials
  with high albedo for roads, parking lots and roofs.</p>
<p>Water quality: A large urban population in developing countries currently does
  not have access to a safe drinking water source (standpipe or borehole) or to
  sanitation services (sewers, septic tanks or wet latrines) (WRI, 1997). Flooding
  may become more frequent with climate change and can affect health through the
  spread of disease. The only way to reduce vulnerability is to build the infrastructure
  to remove solid waste and waste water, and to supply potable water. No sanitation
  technology is &quot;safe&quot; when covered by flood waters, as faecal matter
  mixes with flood waters and is spread wherever the flood waters go. The usual
  focus of drainage design on the performance of the minor drainage system (pipes,
  channels, and overflows) neglects the performance of the major drainage system,
  including flows over land and in the streets, which occurs during major floods.
  As the risk of flooding increases with climate change, so does the importance
  of the major drainage system. New design approaches, which explicitly design
  roads to act as drains, can radically reduce the duration of flooding. Litter
  management is critical to the management of urban drainage systems; often the
  best investment in drainage is better handling of solid waste to prevent systems
  becoming rapidly blocked with debris. </p>
<p><i>Early Warning Systems</i><br>
  Weather and climate forecasts may be used, where appropriate, in preventing
  deaths, injuries and in disease prevention and control. The five-day weather
  forecasts, achieved over the last decade and now routine in many countries,
  have saved millions of lives through warnings of hurricanes, floods and other
  severe weather (Noji, 1997). For example, deaths due to tropical cyclones in
  South Asia have been dramatically reduced due to meteorological forecasts, systems
  to disseminate forecasts and the building of storm shelters. The use of historical
  climate data for planning may reduce food insecurity in many countries. However,
  meteorological and related services are not used to their full potential in
  mitigating the adverse health impacts of climate variability.</p>
<p>Illness and deaths due to heatwaves can be prevented by hot weather watch/warning
  systems, which alert people to impending dangerous weather and provide information
  on how to avoid illness during weather extremes (Kalkstein et al., 1996). Sentinel
  surveillance in emergency departments can also be used to monitor increases
  in heat-related cases (Kellermann and Todd, 1996).</p>
<p>Seasonal regional climate forecasts have proved useful in guiding farmers in
  Brazil, Zimbabwe, Peru, and other countries in the planting of drought resistant
  crops and management of fisheries during El Ni&ntilde;o years (Glantz, 1996).
  Seasonal forecasts have been included into many local and regional famine and
  drought early warning systems (Glantz, 1994). Associations between El Ni&ntilde;o
  and malaria epidemics in Asia and South America have also been described (Bouma
  and Dye, 1997; Bouma and van der Kaay, 1996; Kovats et al., 1999). The use of
  climate forecasts for epidemic forecasting needs to be incorporated with early
  warning systems based on known epidemic risk factors (e.g., heavy rainfall).
  Initiatives that are underway in East and Southern Africa and India to develop
  these new approaches for the surveillance and control of epidemic malaria should
  be supported. </p>
