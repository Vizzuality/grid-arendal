<h1>9.1 Introduction<sup><small><a href="fn10.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(10,2); return false;">2</a></small></sup></h1>
<p>The industrial sector is extremely diverse and involves a wide range of activities
  including the extraction of natural resources, conversion into raw materials,
  and manufacture of finished products. We define the industrial sector as industry
  including the minerals processing industries. The sub-sectors that account for
  roughly 45% of all industrial energy consumption are iron and steel, chemicals,
  petroleum refining, pulp and paper, and cement. These industries are generally
  concerned with the transformation of raw material inputs (e.g. iron ore, crude
  oil, wood) into usable materials and products for an economy. Due to the wide
  variety in activities, energy demand and GHG emissions vary widely. Hence, the
  aggregate energy use and emissions depend on the structure (or specific set
  of activities) of industry, and the energy and carbon intensity of each of the
  activities. The structure of industry may depend on the phase of the economy,
  as well as many other factors like resource and technology<sup><small><a href="fn10.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(10,2); return false;">2</a></small></sup>
  availability as well as historical factors.</p>
<p>In 1995 industry accounted for 41% (131 EJ) (Price et al., 1998) of global
  energy use and up to 47% of global CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions
  (IPCC SAR, 1996). Besides CO<span class="subscript">2</span> industry also emits
  various other GHGs, i.e. CFCs, HFCs, HCFCs, CH4, N2O, PFCs, CF4, C2F6, and SF6
  (IPCC SAR, 1996). Between 1971 and 1990, industrial energy use grew at a rate
  of 2.1% per year, slightly less than the world energy demand growth of 2.5%
  per year. This growth rate of industrial energy use has slowed in recent years,
  falling to an annual average growth of 0.2% between 1990 and 1995, primarily
  because of declines in industrial output in the CEITs. Energy use in the industrial
  sector is dominated by the OECD countries, which account for 44% of world industrial
  energy use. Non-Annex I countries and CEITs used 37% and 20% of 1995 world industrial
  energy, respectively. Industrial production is growing at a fast rate in non-Annex
  I countries. The trends in industrial energy use and CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  emissions are depicted in <a href="170.htm#t91">Table 9.1</a>.</p>

<p>Industrial production is an important engine to increase the economic activity,
  generate employment, and build up the infrastructure in developing countries.
  Investment in industry seems to have a stronger relation with economic growth
  than investments in other sectors (UNIDO, 1997). This can also be observed from
  the growing importance of industry in, and its contribution to the growth of
  a developing nation's economy (UNIDO, 1997). High industrial growth also promotes
  technological change (UNIDO, 1997). Capital investment in industry is important
  to achieve economic welfare in developing countries. Capital relates to physical
  (e.g. equipment), human (e.g. education) and technological capital (e.g. science,
  R&amp;D). Industrialisation builds on the contribution of science and technology,
  as is evidenced by the Chinese economic development in the past decades (Song,
  1997). However, industrial technology should fit the needs of the users in developing
  economies. Technologies developed for a specific industrial infrastructure (e.g.
  raw materials used (UNEP, 1997), relative shares of production costs) may not
  always be the right choice for another one, as is shown by examples of industrial
  technology applied in Tanzania (Yhdego, 1995) and India (Schumacher and Sathaye,
  1998). Adaptation and development of technology to suit the needs is an essential
  step in the successful transfer of technology. Hence, technology transfer is
  a process, involving the trade and investment in technology, the selection (e.g.
  new, second-hand), adoption, adaptation, and dissemination of industrial technology,
  and, last but not least, capacity building, as science and technology are strongly
  related (Song, 1997) in the development of an industrial infrastructure. </p>
<p>Future growth of basic industries will, to a large extent, occur in developing
  countries. While developing countries are the most important markets for new
  and energy efficient processes, technology is still primarily developed in industrialised
  countries, despite the fact that the absolute demand for such technologies is
  stagnating or relatively low. Industrialised countries will be less favourable
  theatres for the innovation of technologies in the primary materials processing
  industries, if there are limited applications for such in industrialised countries.
  This development stresses the need both for technology adaptation to the prevailing
  conditions in developing countries, and intensified collaboration between suppliers
  and users of new industrial processes. Technology transfer needs to be studied
  within these perspectives. However, it seems that environmentally sound technologies
  do not transfer as rapidly as e.g. information technology, particularly with
  regard to developing countries. Also, the rapidly increasing role of transnational
  companies and foreign direct investment (UNCTAD, 1997) may change the patterns
  of technology transfer (see <a href="172.htm">Section 9.3</a>). These issues
  warrant a specific study of transfer of environmentally sound industrial technology,
  with an emphasis on GHG abatement technologies.</p>
<p>In this chapter we describe the experiences with various forms of technology
  transfer. After a brief summary of the technologies for GHG mitigation, mainly
  based on previous IPCC reports, we discuss the trends in technology transfer
  from a 'macro' perspective (<a href="172.htm">Section 9.3</a>). In <a href="172.htm">Section
  9.3</a> we describe the trends from an economic perspective, and study magnitude
  and directions, as well as sources of investment and technology. In <a href="176.htm">Sections
  9.4</a> and <a href="179.htm">9.5</a> we study the processes of technology transfer
  between and within countries, based on case-study material and other literature
  sources. Next, there is an evaluation of the analysed material and a description
  of the main lessons learned in <a href="182.htm">Section 9.6</a>, and this is
  followed by a summary.</p>
