<h3>5.2.4. Financing by Multilateral Development Banks </h3>
<p> The Multilateral Development Banks (MDB) have seen technology transfer as
  part of their mission to encourage development. More recently they started to
  focus on the challenges of the environment and the specific problems involved
  in transferring environmental technology. In response many have started to develop
  a range of initiatives and activities.<br>
  <br>
  In particular, development banks have become aware of the role they can play
  in helping to mobilise private capital to help meet the needs of sustainable
  development and the environment, and of the potential to use financial innovation
  to encourage environmental projects and initiatives. While much of the earlier
  work they did was sporadic, the private sector arms of the MDBs are now seeking
  to identify ways they can work with international private capital to help address
  the environmental and developmental needs and are discussed in <a href="108.htm">Section
  5.5</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The World Bank itself is limited by its charter to only working with governments
    and quasi government organisations, although it is increasingly developing
    mechanisms to deal with private and quasi-private sector entities. Its affiliate,
    the International Finance Corporation (IFC), is most directly involved in
    private sector investment. However, the World Bank has developed a number
    of initiatives with the potential to support environmental technology transfer
    (Asad, 1997) . These include financing a number of environmental lending programmes
    at domestic financial institutions, which will then lend to industry. An important
    new World Bank initiative is the proposed US$60-$150 million Prototype Carbon
    Fund. This vehicle will provide additional finance for CO<span class="subscript">2
    </span>mitigating projects in return for carbon offsets, i.e. the right to
    transfer the credit for the CO<span class="subscript">2</span> saved to the investor. It is expected to have
    a substantial private sector financing and project execution. The World Bank
    has also prepared a major environmental strategy for the energy sector called
    Fuel for Thought.</li>
  <li> The Global Environmental Facility is a financial mechanism that was established
    prior to the 1992 Earth Summit (see <a href="099.htm#b52">Box 5.2</a>) to
    provide grant and concessional finance to recipient countries for projects
    and activities that aim to protect the global environment. There are three
    official implementing agents, the UNDP, UNEP and the World Bank. The World
    Bank also acts as trustee of the GEF Trust Fund. The focus of the GEF is on
    providing incremental funding for projects that would not be viable on the
    basis of domestic considerations alone. The GEF has supported a growing, but
    proportionately small number of private sector investment operations. As part
    of its private sector portfolio, the GEF has made US$110 million in commitments
    to the IFC for climate change mitigation initiatives. A requirement for funding
    by the GEF is the demonstration of incremental global environmental benefits.
    This can be a time consuming and expensive process that increases transaction
    costs, although these problems are more marked with the Biodiversity Convention
    than support provided under the FCCC. The Buenos Aires Conference (CoP4) also
    officially expanded the scope of the GEF, for example, to include adaptation.</li>
  <li> The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), as the newest
    MDB, is the only one to have sustainable development incorporated in its charter.
    It is also much more active in working with the private sector than the other
    regional MDBs. Thus it is not surprising that it has shown a fair amount of
    leadership in helping to encourage technology transfer. It has built up a
    large and successful portfolio of loans in areas such as private energy service
    companies and municipal environmental infrastructure in developing countries.
    In addition, it has also worked with intermediary banks to educate them on
    environmental issues and the potential of clean technology. </li>
  <li> Other MDBs, such as the regional development banks (ADB, IDB, AfDB) all
    play an important role in regional investment, and most have given some attention
    to issues of sustainable development, in varied ways. The European Investment
    Bank, while differing in that it is an institution of the European Union (and
    thus has a limited membership), is also a huge investor with an increasing
    focus on lending outside the EU, particularly to the Asia-Pacific-Caribbean
    countries under the Lome Convention, and also to Central and Eastern Europe
    and the countries of the Mediterranean basin. Its investment programmes, however,
    have not generally been coordinated with the EU's goals on sustainable development
    and climate change. </li>
  <li> Various international agencies also harness considerable expenditure. Most
    notably, the UN Development Programme makes substantial grants in the area
    of institutional capacity-building. It has also directly supported the development
    of various financial mechanisms to encourage environmental technology transfer,
    such as supporting the feasibility work for an environmental venture capital
    fund. </li>

    <td>
      <p>Since its inception in 1991, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) has
	promoted technology transfer of energy efficiency and renewable energy
	technologies through a series of projects in developing countries. Following
	a three-year pilot phase, the GEF in 1996 adopted an operational strategy
	and three long-term operational programmes for promoting energy efficiency
	and renewable energy technologies by reducing barriers, implementation
	costs, and long-term technology costs. A significant aim of these programmes
	is to catalyse sustainable markets and enable the private sector to transfer
	technologies. </p>
      <p>From 1991 to mid-1999 the GEF approved grants totalling US$706 million
	for 72 energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in 45 countries.
	The total cost of these projects exceeds US$5 billion, because the GEF
	has leveraged financing through loans and other resources from governments,
	other donor agencies, the private sector, and the three GEF project-implementing
	agencies (UN Development Programme, UN Environment Programme and World
	Bank Group). An additional US$180 million in grants for enabling activities
	and short-term response measures have been approved for climate change.</p>
      <p>GEF projects are testing and demonstrating a variety of financing and
	institutional models for promoting technology diffusion. For example,
	fourteen projects diffuse photovoltaic (PV) technologies in rural areas
	through a variety of mechanisms: financial intermediaries (India and Sri
	Lanka), local photovoltaic dealers/entrepreneurs (Peru, China, Zimbabwe
	and Indonesia), and rural energy-service concessions (Argentina). Several
	other projects assist public and private project developers to install
	grid-based wind, biomass and geothermal technologies (China, India, Philippines,
	Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Mauritania, Mauritius). For energy-efficiency technologies,
	projects promote technology diffusion through energy-service companies
	(China), utility-based demand-side management (Thailand, Mexico and Jamaica),
	private-sector sales of efficient lighting products (Poland), technical
	assistance and capacity building (China), and regulatory frameworks for
	municipal heating markets in formerly planned economies (Bulgaria, Romania,
	Russia). In addition, projects provide direct assistance to manufacturers
	for developing and marketing more efficient refrigerators and industrial
	boilers through foreign technology transfer (China).</p>
      <p>The achieved energy savings and renewable-energy capacity installed through
	GEF-supported projects are small but not insignificant relative to world
	markets. For example, wind-power capacity directly installed or planned
	for approved projects is 350 MW, relative to an installed base of 1,200
	MW in developing countries in 1997. The GEF has approved close to 500
	MW of geothermal projects, which compares with over 1,100 MW installed
	worldwide from 1991 to 1996. There are an estimated 250 to 500 thousand
	solar home systems now installed in developing countries and approved
	GEF projects would add up to one million additional systems to this total
	in the next several years. Replication or &quot;indirect&quot; effects
	are also key aspects of GEF project designs; through demonstrations, new
	institutional models, policy changes, stakeholder dialogues, and other
	project activities, GEF projects have provided an important stimulus for
	technology transfer beyond these direct project impacts. </p>
      <p>Capacity-building is a central feature of most GEF projects and is resulting
	in indirect impacts on host countries' abilities to master, absorb and
	diffuse technologies. Projects build the human resources and institutional
	capacities that are widely recognised as important conditions for technology
	adoption and diffusion. For example, the China Energy Conservation project
	is building capacities of private-sector energy service companies, as
	well as those of public agencies to disseminate information, experience
	and best practices. In West Africa, a GEF project is helping develop regulatory
	frameworks, standards, tariff structures, and technical capacity for more
	efficient buildings. </p>
      <p>Several GEF projects are designed to directly mobilise private-sector
	finance. For example, in the IFC/GEF Poland Efficient Lighting project
	(<a href="330.htm">Case Study 2</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>),
	a US$6 retail price reduction for energy-efficient lamps was possible
	with only a US$2 grant because of manufacturer contributions, and 1.6
	million lamps were installed. Through the International Finance Corporation
	(IFC), four GEF projects--the Renewable Energy/Energy Efficiency Fund,
	the Photovoltaics Market Transformation Initiative, the Solar Development
	Corporation, and the Hungary Energy Efficiency Co-financing programme
	are designed to leverage US$490 million in private-sector financing for
	technology transfer with US$105 million in GEF grants.</p>
