<h3>2.2.7 Other Investment and Assistance Flows</h3>
<p><i>Export credit agencies</i><br>
  Governments often facilitate private technology sales by making available export
  credits, providing various types of risk guarantees, and playing a market intermediation
  role through trade missions and export promotion programmes. The focus of such
  efforts, however, is often promoting exports rather than transferring technology
  to the recipient country in the broad sense used in this Report. Some observers
  have questioned whether export promotion programmes serve the goal of facilitating
  transfer of climate-friendly technology, or whether they are actually counterproductive
  in this regard.</p>
<p>Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) use a number of financial instruments to give
  national industries advantages: export credits, project financing, risk guarantees
  and insurance (see also <a href="098.htm">Section 5.2.3</a> and <a href="098.htm#b51">Box
  5.1).</a> These financial supports are provided at terms that are more favourable
  than those provided by purely commercial banks or investment houses. Although
  ECAs have traditionally focused on export credits, they are increasingly providing
  services that support foreign direct investment (long-term project financing
  and investment guarantees or insurance). </p>
<p><i>Trends</i><br>
  On average ECA flows in the mid-1990s reached an average of $110 to $120 billion
  annually (World Bank, 1998b). This represents more than twice the average flows
  of official development assistance reaching developing countries during this
  period ($50 billion annually on average), and about three times the annual average
  for concessional financing provided by multilateral development banks, about
  $40 billion (World Bank, 1998b). Furthermore, over 80 per cent of ECA financing
  to developing countries is provided by the world's seven major industrialised
  economies (the G-7, or Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom
  and the United States). In parallel fashion, the destinations of ECA financing
  is concentrated in just 10 developing countries, and among these the top two
  (Indonesia and China) account for more than half of the total (Maurer and Bhandari,
  2000).</p>
<p>A study based on information from a commercial database indicates that fully
  two-thirds of private financing going to developing countries between 1994 and
  the first quarter of 1999 ($217 billion) was concentrated in investments and
  exports that can be considered to be carbon or energy-intensive, such as upstream
  and downstream oil and gas development, fossil fuelled power generation, heavy
  infrastructure, energy-intensive manufacturing, and aircraft (Maurer and Bhandari,
  2000). Of this, ECAs accounted for 20 per cent, or $44 billion, of the direct
  financing or guarantees. More significantly, however, ECAs played some financing
  role in just under half of the financing ($103 billion) for these energy-intensive
  investments and exports. ECAs, therefore, have a significant leveraging effect
  and their participation in a project or trade deal draws in significant private
  capital (Maurer and Bhandari, 2000).</p>
<p><i>NGO flows</i><br>
  Many non-governmental organisations, foundations, and industry associations
  support technology transfer activities to developing countries, particularly
  through efforts that aim to develop capacity or demonstrate technologies (see
  also <a href="056.htm">Section 4.4</a>). These range from small, not-for-profit
  development oriented organisations to industry consortia that have as members
  large utilities and technology providers.</p>
<p>Grants by NGOs to developing countries have stayed fairly constant during the
  last decade, ranging between US$5 billion and US$6 billion per year since 1990
  (OECD, 1999c). Not all of these support technology transfer efforts, however,
  but they may be significant in the least developed countries. Little data on
  the distribution of grants by NGOs appears to be available. NGOs are important
  in that they often help community based organisations in developing countries
  obtain support through foundation grants and ODA. </p>
