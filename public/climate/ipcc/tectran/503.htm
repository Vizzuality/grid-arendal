<h1>3. Sectoral Actions </h1>
<p>The key actions for the transfer of mitigation and adaptation technologies
  vary across sectors. Governments, private actors and community organisations
  are all involved in technology transfer in each sector, although their roles
  and the extent of their involvement differ within and across sectors. It is
  important to note the special characteristics of adaptation technologies. Adaptation
  in anticipation of future climate change is faced with uncertainty about location,
  rate and magnitude of climate change impacts. Adaptation technologies often
  address site-specific issues and their benefits are primarily local, which could
  hamper large scale replication. On the other hand they could reduce vulnerability
  not only to anticipated impacts of climate change but also to contemporary hazards
  associated with climate variability.</p>
<p>Central lessons learned through the sectoral studies are: (1) networking among
  stakeholders is essential for effective technology transfer, and (2) most effective
  technology transfers focus on products and techniques with multiple benefits.
  Actions that have been effective in technology transfer in the sectors evaluated
  in the Report, are:</p>
<p><b>Buildings </b><br>
  World-wide, the mix of relevant ESTs will vary, depending upon the climate;
  rural-urban distribution, and historical context. The effective actions for
  the transfer of ESTs may include, (1) government financing for incentives for
  the construction of more energy efficient and environmentally friendly homes,
  (2) building codes and guidelines, and equipment standards developed in consultation
  with industry to minimise adverse impacts on manufacturers; (3) energy and environmental
  performance labels on consumer products; (4) government programmes for more
  energy efficient and environmentally friendly buildings, office appliances and
  other equipment, (5) demand-side management programmes to promote energy-efficient
  lighting and equipment, and (6) R&amp;D to develop products in the building
  sector that meet community priorities.</p>
<p><b>Transport</b><br>
  Technological options - improved technology design and maintenance, alternative
  or improved fuels, vehicle use change, and modal shifts - as well as non-technical
  options, transport demand reduction, and improved management systems can reduce
  GHG emissions significantly. There are also non-transport options such as urban
  planning and transport demand substitution, such as telematics and improved
  telecommunications. Resource availability, technical know-how, and institutional
  capacity are among the factors that affect the cost and transfer of these options.
</p>
<p>Government policies can promote co-operative technology agreements among companies
  of different countries, joint R&amp;D, joint information networks, improved
  technical and management skills, and specialized training programmes. Adoption
  of appropriate standards and regulations can stimulate and facilitate technology
  transfer within and among countries. Partnership between government and the
  private sector and among countries can also help promote technology transfer
  within and among countries.</p>
<p><b>Industry </b><br>
  New processes, efficient energy and resource use, substitution of materials,
  changes in design and manufacture of products resulting in less material use,
  and increased recycling, can substantially reduce GHG emissions. Environmental
  legislation, regulation and voluntary agreements between government and industry
  can stimulate the development of efficient technologies and can lead to increased
  use of ESTs. Public technology assessment capabilities are important to provide
  information and capabilities to successfully transfer ESTs. Well defined clearinghouses
  can be useful in disseminating information to improve energy efficiency, especially
  with respect to small and medium-sized enterprises that often do not have the
  resources to assess technologies. Long term support for capacity building is
  essential, stressing the need for the co-operation of equipment and software
  suppliers and users. Experience has shown that investment in developing local
  capability to undertake adaptation to indigenous conditions is crucial to the
  success of industrial EST transfer.</p>
<p><b>Energy Supply </b><br>
  In general, the private sector plays a strong role in the transfer of energy
  supply technologies based in oil and gas sources and technology transfer mechanisms
  have been established for some time. Restructuring of the electricity sector
  world-wide is rapidly changing the direction of investments in the power sector
  with growing participation of the private sector. At the same time the transfer
  of energy supply technologies for some other conventional and renewable sources,
  which often depends on the government to preserve or increase their presence
  in the market, is restricted due to institutional and socio-economic barriers.
  Nevertheless, the role of the government and multilateral banks are important
  in every sector to foster and ensure conditions for international financing,
  establishing appropriate regulatory frameworks and create conditions to couple
  new energy investments, environmentally sound projects and sustainable development.
  Enabling actions by governments to promote energy options, including renewable
  resources, that are assisting to mitigate climate change, can be crucial to
  mobilise private capital for ESTs and raise increased attention to energy efficiency.</p>
<p><b>Agriculture</b><br>
  Development of appropriate information bases on inter alia improved crop species
  and varieties, irrigation facilities, different tillage and crop management
  systems, and livestock manure treatment, including biogas recovery systems,
  can facilitate and promote the transfer of adaptation and mitigation technologies
  within and across countries and integration with indigenous solutions. Governments
  can create incentives for the transfer of ESTs by improving national agricultural
  information systems to disseminate information on ESTs, and expanding credit
  and savings schemes to assist farmers to manage the increased variability in
  their environment. The existing Consultative Group on International Agricultural
  Research (CGIAR) system may be one possible model for an R&amp;D network among
  countries to build such an information base. Capacities to deal with climate
  change technologies and national agricultural research systems including those
  that investigate carbon storage, and early warning systems, are important elements.
  Efforts by developed countries and multilateral agencies can be improved to
  enhance this R&amp;D system.</p>
<p><b>Forestry</b><br>
  Government, community, and international organisations, including conservation
  organisations, have dominated technology transfer in the forestry sector. More
  recently, private establishments have been making inroads. Transfer of practices
  such as sustainable forest management (including reduced impact logging, certification
  techniques and silvicultural practices), recycling, bio-energy technologies
  and agroforestry can contribute to the mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions.
  Establishing clear property rights, participatory forest management, use of
  financial incentives and disincentives, optimal use of regulations and strengthening
  of monitoring and evaluating institutions are government actions that can promote
  their transfer.</p>
<p><b>Waste Management</b><br>
  Mitigation technologies are available and can be readily deployed. Roles of
  governments, private sector, and other organisations are changing. National
  governments can act as facilitators of municipal, private sector, and community-based
  initiatives. The private sector plays an increasing role, because meeting future
  waste management needs depends on expanded private investment. The involvement
  of community organisations is also increasing as the link between community
  support and project sustainability has become clear. It is important that projects
  emphasise the deployment of locally appropriate technologies, and minimise the
  development of conventional large, integrated waste management systems in situations
  where lower cost, simpler alternatives can be used without compromising public
  health and environmental standards. </p>
<p><b>Human Health</b><br>
  An effective health system can help to address the adverse health impacts of
  climate change. Transfer of existing health technologies within and across countries
  can assist in achieving this objective. Raising public awareness of likely health
  impacts, close monitoring of health outcomes and training of health professionals
  are suitable actions. Thus, in terms of technology transfer there is a need
  to ensure that technologies are available at national and local levels for coping
  with any changes in the burden of disease that might be associated with climate
  change.</p>
<p><b>Coastal Adaptation </b><br>
  Technology transfer should focus on proven technologies for coastal adaptation,
  including indigenous solutions. Wetland restoration and preservation are examples
  of such proven adaptation technologies. Effective transfers of adaptation technologies
  are part of integrated coastal-management plans or programmes, that utilizes
  local expertise. Because coastal management is predominantly a public activity,
  technology transfer in coastal zones is driven by governments. Fragmented organisational
  and institutional relationships and lack of access to financial means are major
  barriers to the transfer of coastal adaptation technologies. Coastal adaptation
  programmes, based on strong partnership between existing institutions, can provide
  an effective response.</p>
