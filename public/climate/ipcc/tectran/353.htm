  <b>Summary</b><br>
  National Tree Growers Co-operative Federation (NTGCF) was established in India 
  in 1988 with the main objective of restoring the ecological security of village 
  communities in eco-fragile and marginalised zones. The NTGCF has promoted the 
  organisation and establishment of village-level Tree Growers Cooperative Societies 
  (TGCS) in six states of the country, and provided technical and financial support 
  for regenerating degraded forests, conservation of natural resources through 
  community protection, and activities related to Joint Forest Management. Nearly 
  11 million trees have been planted, resulting in fuelwood, fodder and employment 
  benefits for the villagers, as well as in indirect benefits such as enhanced 
  carbon sequestration and the setting up of processing units for higher value-added 
  products.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Background</b><br>
  The NTGCF was created in 1988 with the objective of restoring and protecting 
  the ecological security of the country through the creation of self-sustaining 
  village TGCS, and supporting the activities of these Cooperatives through training, 
  financing, and institutional development. The concept of the NTGCF was based 
  on the recognition of land degradation as a major concern, and informed by the 
  earlier success of the National Dairy Development Board in the enhancement of 
  milk production through milk cooperatives. <br>
  <br>
  Financial assistance by the Swedish International Development Authority in 1991 
  and the Canadian International Development Agency in 1993 enabled the NTGCF 
  to establish activities in six states of India: Gujarat, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, 
  Rajasthan, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective</b><br>
  The main objective of the TGCS has been the restoration of the biological productivity 
  of marginally productive and unproductive degraded lands by establishing sustainable 
  fuelwood and fodder plantations to meet the essential needs of the villagers. 
  Additional produce caters to the urban demand for fuelwood, timber and tree-based 
  products. Concurrent objectives include the strengthening of existing village 
  institutions and empowerment of women.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Approach</b><br>
  NTGCF facilitates the organisation and establishment of TGCSs in villages, and 
  assists the villagers in acquiring village wastelands on long leases. In cases 
  where village-level forest-management institutions already exist, NTGCF helps 
  them frame management rules based on specific village needs. The degraded lands 
  are restored to a productive state through natural regeneration plantations 
  and soil and water conservation measures. In some areas, large scale seed sowing 
  of forest trees and shrubs was done. For the seeds to germinate on difficult 
  sites, alternations such as wildings at the super-abundant stage of germination 
  and replanting on village lands, soil stabilisation and moisture conservation 
  work had been undertaken. The villagers are supplied seeds, saplings, cuttings 
  and biofertilisers. NTGCF promotes community protection of forests by ensuring 
  that forest-management rules link the needs of the villagers to the sustainability 
  of the forests.<br>
  <br>
  NTGCF has had to contend with many issues such as common property rights, sustainable 
  extraction of rare and endangered medicinal and aromatic plant species, appropriate 
  market channels for surplus produce, legislative enactments, etc. This has lead 
  to capacity building in the Cooperatives and in NTGCF to influence policy with 
  regard to forest dwelling communities and conservation. <br>
  <br>
  In order to manage biomass demand, NTGCF and the TGCS encourage and facilitate 
  the adoption of energy conserving techniques and devices such as improved stoves, 
  biogas plants, pressure cookers and solar cookers. They have also developed 
  facilities for the processing and marketing of wood at Cooperative and regional 
  levels, and created opportunities for the value-addition of forest products, 
  such as a Neem biocide plant.<br>
  <b><br>
  Impacts</b><br>
  As of March 1998, NTGCF had organised TGCS and other village institutions in 
  518 villages involving 40,237 members. These institutions have revegetated 8,911 
  hectares of the 15,343 hectares of the common lands made available, and planted 
  10.74 million trees on their common land as well as private lands. This work 
  has generated 1.22 million workdays of employment in these villages. Indirect 
  benefits to the leased land has included soil fertility improvements and moisture 
  retention, and benefits to nearby land has included wind protection and decreased 
  salinity.<br>
  The experience of the older TGCS promotes the organisation of new Cooperatives 
  in surrounding villages, and proposals to organise TGCS on non-revenue wasteland, 
  which are either equally degraded or belong to the village, are being introduced. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The global benefits include carbon sequestration in standing trees, litter and 
  soil. Furthermore, fuelwood supply from the new forests leads to conservation 
  of C sinks in forests and village trees. The NTGCF has not conducted ecological 
  studies of these plantations with regard to the survival of seedlings and the 
  standing biomass, but based on the NTGCF experience, it is estimated that its 
  activities have lead to the sequestration of 52,183 tCO<span class="subscript">2</span>. Carbon density of 
  litter and soils also increases. Thus, in addition to restoration of degraded 
  lands, carbon sequestration is an additional benefit of the projects. If the 
  TGCS concept is extended to cover all the degraded forest land, pasture, and 
  cultivatable wasteland of 41.62 million ha, the annual C sequestered could be 
  ~ 20.81 MtC.<br>
  <b><br>
  Lessons Learned</b><br>
  One of the major reasons for the success of the project is its ability to secure 
  tenure of the land in the form of a lease. This kind of ownership allows communities 
  to take a long-term view, and encourages better management of the common lands. 
  The NTGCF experience indicates that the village institutions that have become 
  self-sustaining are those that the communities developed themselves and built 
  on local knowledge and needs. A mid-term review concluded that the sustainability 
  of TGCSs in terms of social and economic aspects is closely linked to the sustained 
  collective action of the community. Introduction of alien rules and regulations 
  leads to confusion and non-compliance. <br>
  <br>
  The protection and management of land leased by the cooperative societies has, 
  however, shifted the pressure on surrounding common lands. NTGCF proposes to 
  take a holistic look at the entire village landscape while dealing with the 
  common land resources with secured tenure. <br>
  <br>
  Creating awareness, capacity building and establishment of a formal institution 
  such as TGCS at the village level is critical to revegetation of degraded village 
  commons. An external institution such as NTGCF is necessary for providing technical 
  assistance and training to local communities to protect and manage village commons.<br>
  <br>
  The other effects of the projects are leadership development, spread of collective 
  action and cooperation into other spheres of village life, institutional development, 
  resource enrichment and expansion, and improvement in the quality of life of 
  rural communities. <br>
