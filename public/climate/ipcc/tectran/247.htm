<h3>12.5.7 Institutional Mechanisms </h3>
<p> A large number of institutions will be involved in technology transfer between
  countries. They are multilateral agencies, bilateral agencies, commercial financing
  agencies, international R&amp;D institutions, national and international NGOs,
  national Ministries of Environment, forest departments, timber companies, brokerage
  agencies, and national research institutions. The governments have to play a
  key facilitative role. There is an increased need and scope for private sector
  participation particularly in the forestry sector projects, currently dominated
  by the state forest departments. Brokerage institutions could play a key role
  in providing information on potential sources of funding, technological alternatives
  and sources, and in assisting local institutions in developing countries in
  preparing project proposals and in negotiating terms and conditions. Similarly,
  local, national and international NGOs could ensure appropriate technologies
  are transferred and interests of forest dependent communities are protected.
  Institutions such as FAO, CIFOR, and ICRAF could promote international scientific
  collaborations and capacity building in developing countries.<br>
  <br>
  The current low level of technology transfer in the forestry sector can partly
  be attributed to institutional inadequacies, some of which are listed in <a href="234.htm#t122">Table
  12.2</a>, as institutional barriers. The majority of the institutions have to
  be set up in non-Annex I countries and financial support for capacity building
  and providing incentives to local communities, timber logging companies may
  have to come from Annex I countries. However, timber certification agencies
  may have to be set up in Annex I countries. These certification agencies could
  be internationally approved by credible agencies to ensure an unbiased evaluation.<br>
  <br>
  Adoption of mechanisms to promote technology transfer in the forestry sector
  requires the existing institutions as well as some new institutions. The existing
  bilateral and multilateral institutions will continue to play a dominant role
  in funding forestry-sector mitigation projects. Once the new mechanisms such
  as JI and CDM are approved, there will be an increased interest in funding forestry
  mitigation projects, provided that forestry projects are permitted. One of the
  key barriers to increased participation of bilateral, multilateral and private
  sector institutions is the uncertainty regarding the sustainability, measurement
  and verification of the C abated. Thus, it is very important to establish internationally
  acceptable monitoring and verification procedures and institutions. International
  institutions such as FAO, NGOs and private firms pre-approved by the FCCC Secretariat
  for monitoring and verification are required (Sathaye et al., 1997). These institutions
  could also play a role in the timber certification process. <br>
  <br>
  Currently, many of the institutions, particularly in developing countries, are
  not aware of the opportunities provided under new and emerging mechanisms. In
  addition, these institutions in developing countries may not have access to
  all the information required and the procedures for preparing proposals and
  for negotiating terms and conditions. Thus, there is a need for setting up technology
  transfer mechanisms or brokerage institutions to assist multilateral and bilateral
  institutions, industries and utilities in Annex I countries as well as the governments,
  farmers' organisations, NGOs and industries in developing countries. Even agencies
  such as the World Bank are already acting as intermediaries between the utilities
  in OECD countries and recipient agencies in developing countries (e.g., carbon
  fund). Promotion of forestry-sector mitigation projects and the accompanying
  technology component would require careful attention as its adoption could impact
  biodiversity and the watershed role of forests and further affect the poorest
  and indigenous communities. Due to the potential of forestry mitigation programmes
  for biodiversity conservation, watershed protection, and provision of socio-economic
  benefits, it may be necessary to provide additional incentives.</p>
