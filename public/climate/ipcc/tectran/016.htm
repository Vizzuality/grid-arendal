<h1>Annex 1-3: A Stakeholder Typology</h1>
<p><b>Stakeholders Description</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b> Sources and developers of technology</b></li>
</ul>
<p> Individuals/organisations who undertake original research to develop technology.
  Typical developers include scientific research organisations, R&amp;D departments
  within private firms, and government-sponsored research entities. Technology
  can be developed in either the public or private sector.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b> Owners and suppliers of technology</b></li>
</ul>
<p> These usually include private firms, state-owned enterprises, and government
  agencies. Technology developed in the public sector often is &quot;spun off&quot;
  to the private sector, since the private sector is seen as better able to exploit
  the market potential of the technology. In some countries, however, public sector
  organisations now compete with suppliers of technology that are based in the
  private sector.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b> Buyers of technology </b></li>
</ul>
<p>The primary stakeholders in the technology transfer process. Buyers of technology
  usually are private firms, but can also include state-owned enterprises, government
  agencies, and individual entrepreneurs.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b> Financiers of technology transfer</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Those who lend to technology buyers, or invest in them to enable the buyers
  to acquire the technology from the suppliers. Organisations involved include
  commercial banks, international financial institutions (e.g., the International
  Finance Corporation), and individual or institutional investors.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b> Information providers</b></li>
</ul>
<p> Include organisations such as UN agencies that have no commercial interest
  at stake and whose objective is to facilitate matchmaking between the buyer's
  needs and the suppliers by providing objective, unbiased information. This information
  could include technology options, sources of technology, case studies where
  technologies have been used, data and data processing information, and methods
  for evaluating different options.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b> Market intermediaries</b></li>
</ul>
<p> Include consultants, NGOs, media, consumer groups, and trade associations.
  Market intermediaries usually can have significant influence on the buyer's
  decision by providing information about technologies. Depending on the interest
  of the intermediary, this information may promote certain technologies at the
  expense of others.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b> Governments</b></li>
</ul>
<p> The government of the buyer's country sets the rules for transactions through
  regulation, incentives, and frameworks governing imports of technology/foreign
  capital. Where the government perceives that the private costs of technology
  may not reflect the true costs to society (e.g., a technology may have environmental
  externalities), the government may be involved in expanding or limiting the
  range of technologies under consideration. The government of countries whose
  companies sell technologies may set policies to promote technology transfer
  in support of the climate stabilisation, via ODA and other measures.</p>
