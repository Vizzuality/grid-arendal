<h3>7.5.5 Leading by Example </h3>
<p><i>Within Countries</i><br>
  The government is the largest single consumer of energy in most countries. Governments
  can reduce their own energy costs through the operation of their buildings,
  through the design features of new buildings, and through the efficiency of
  the energy-using products they buy. Through environmentally sound decisions,
  governments can also provide an example to those who own, rent, and operate
  privately-owned residential, commercial and institutional buildings. Government
  policies are also important in myriad additional ways. For example, governments
  can use their purchasing power to create a market for energy-efficient products.
  Government leaders can stimulate the demand for &quot;Green&quot; products through
  public recognition for voluntary industry efforts to market ESTs.</p>
<p>Few governments are taking advantage of the opportunity to show leadership
  in their management of their own energy consumption, according to a recent survey
  of 25 countries in Europe, North America, Latin America and Asia (Borg et al.,
  1997). The survey questionnaire was distributed to knowledgeable government
  people in 25 countries. The most active programmes were reported in Canada,
  the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States. The common government programmes
  included setting energy-saving targets, tracking progress toward the targets,
  recognising successes, requiring the purchasing of efficient equipment, providing
  information and training, as well as financing schemes, and conducting energy
  audits and demonstration projects. Additional countries have adopted Climate
  Change programmes in their building sectors, including Australia, the United
  Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand, France and Germany (OECD, 1999) </p>
<p><i>Among Countries</i><br>
  Leading by example has an appealing potential for transferring one country's
  success to another in the climate change field, where countries are striving
  for a common, international goal. The buildings sector offers highly visible
  opportunities to demonstrate this leadership, for example, by integrating climate
  friendly policies into government operations, housing and education programmes.
  Annex I countries have a special responsibility to lead by example in order
  to stimulate adoption by developing countries and CEITs. </p>
<p>A potentially powerful form of international cooperation is present among the
  countries of a region that share common resources, climates, languages, traditions
  and aspirations. For example, renewable energy resources such as solar radiation,
  hydropower, wind, biomass, and geothermal resources are distributed regionally
  without regard to political boundaries. The demand for heating and cooling and
  the available construction materials are common to multi-country regions. Within
  these regions, the technology opportunities are similar. The successful deployment
  of a new technology can spread rapidly. The enhanced regional demand for climate
  friendly technologies can attract development and investments that otherwise
  would be slow to respond to efforts of a single country. </p>
