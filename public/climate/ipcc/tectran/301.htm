<h1>15.4 Current and Future Trends in Coastal-Adaptation Technology Transfer</h1>
<p> <a href="003.htm">Chapter 1</a> identified three fundamentally different pathways
  of technology transfer. These pathways are based on the stakeholder as the primary
  driving force of the technology transfer: the government, the private sector
  or the community. Most of the literature describing and analysing climate-relevant
  technology transfer deals with mitigation technologies. In technology transfer
  for mitigation, the private sector usually plays a crucial part throughout the
  entire pathway from development to diffusion. Market opportunities, investment
  procedures and profitability criteria are key words to discuss the incentives
  and behaviour of both the mitigation-technology provider and recipient.<br>
  <br>
  Most coastal impacts of climate change will impinge on collective goods and
  systems, such as food and water security, biodiversity and human health and
  safety. These impacts could affect commercial interests indirectly, but usually
  the strongest and most direct incentives to adapt are with the public sector.
  Coastal management is therefore usually a public-sector responsibility, and
  the planning and design of coastal adaptation to climate change needs to be
  tuned to existing policy criteria and development objectives (Klein et al.,
  1999). Only in cases where a particular stretch of coastline provides direct
  financial benefits is the private sector likely to invest in coastal management.
  Prime examples of this case are coastal tourist resorts, for which beach erosion
  represents a direct threat to their profitability, and ports and harbours, which
  will have to raise their infrastructure as sea level rises. In most industrialised
  countries, however, the private sector is typically not the stakeholder that
  drives technology transfer for coastal adaptation, because benefits are small
  or uncertain and action is expected from the government to protect private-sector
  interests. In developing countries, the private sector is generally a less significant
  economic force so again governments are expected to lead the way in climate-change
  adaptation strategies.<br>
  <br>
  Coastal-adaptation technology transfer is therefore predominantly government-driven
  (or donor-driven). <a href="348.htm">Case Studies 20</a> and <a href="349.htm">21</a>
  in <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a> provide illustrations of this. Community-driven
  pathways may be found in places where a local need for adaptation is recognised
  but no government or private-sector interest is anticipated. <a href="344.htm">Case
  Study 16</a> presents an example of collective action and joint management to
  combat erosion in Tuvalu. On Viti Levu (Fiji), a traditional village community
  has been actively involved in a mangrove rehabilitation project. This donor-funded
  project has been strongly driven by local concerns, taking into account the
  particular cultural and political settings (Nunn, 1999).<br>
  <br>
  Many of the technologies listed in <a href="296.htm">Section 15.3</a> have been
  applied to adapt to the effects of climate variability in coastal zones. The
  emphasis has traditionally been on protecting developed areas using hard structures.
  The need for technology transfer to plan, design and build these structures
  depends on their required scale and level of sophistication. At a small scale,
  local communities can use readily available materials to build protective structures
  (Mimura and Nunn, 1998). However, these communities often lack the information
  to know whether or not these structures are appropriate and whether or not their
  design standards are acceptable. For larger-scale, more sophisticated structures,
  technical advice is required, as well as a contracting company to build the
  structure. Developing countries may receive bilateral or multilateral funding
  to meet some or all costs involved.<br>
  <br>
  Until recently, it was rarely questioned whether a country's entire coastline
  could be protected effectively if optimal management conditions prevail. It
  has become clear, however, that even with massive amounts of external funding,
  coastlines in the developing world (particularly of archipelagic countries)
  cannot be effectively protected by hard structures. In addition, increasing
  awareness of unwanted effects of hard structures on erosion and sedimentation
  patterns has led to growing recognition of the benefits of &quot;soft&quot;
  protection (e.g., beach nourishment, wetland restoration and creation) and of
  the adaptation strategies retreat and accommodate (Capobianco and Stive, 1997).
  An increasing number of private companies are now discovering market opportunities
  for implementing soft-protection options. Interest in the retreat and accommodate
  strategies is also growing, but markets for these are as yet less developed.
  In spite of this trend to consider adaptation options other than hard protection,
  many structures are still being built without a full evaluation of the alternatives.<br>
  <br>
  A second trend in coastal adaptation is an increasing reliance on technologies
  to develop and manage information (Wright and Bartlett, 1999). This trend stems
  from the recognition that designing an appropriate technology to protect, retreat
  or accommodate requires a considerable amount of data on a range of coastal
  parameters, as well as a good understanding of the uncertainties involved in
  the impacts to be addressed (Capobianco, 1999). National, regional and global
  monitoring networks are being set up to help to assess adaptation needs and
  opportunities. In the Caribbean, for example, developing information has been
  presented as the first phase of a regional adaptation process and as such has
  been found eligible for funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) (see
  <a href="348.htm">Case Study 20</a>).<br>
  <br>
  Thirdly, many efforts are now initiated to enhance awareness of the need for
  appropriate coastal adaptation, often as maladaptive practices are becoming
  apparent. For example, before a new hospital was built in Kiribati in 1992,
  a substantial site-selection document had been prepared, examining numerous
  aspects of three alternative sites but without consideration of coastal processes.
  A serious shoreline erosion problem advancing rapidly to within eight metres
  of the hospital was discovered by 1995 (Forbes and Hosoi, 1995). Efforts to
  enhance awareness include national and international workshops and conferences,
  training programmes, on-line courses and technical assistance and capacity building
  as part of bilateral or multilateral projects. In view of the many sectoral
  interests in coastal zones it will become increasingly important to involve
  decision-makers without direct responsibility for coastal issues and other stakeholders
  in this ongoing learning process (Humphrey and Burbridge, 1999; King, 1999).
