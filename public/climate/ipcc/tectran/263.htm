<h3> 13.4.2 Encouraging Technology Transfer</h3>
<p>
  Many of the actions that promote technology transfer within a country should
  involve government agencies, private entities and local community organisations
  to be fully successful (see <a href="051.htm">Chapter 4</a> on the role of enabling
  environments for technology transfer). In general, the government-driven pathway
  tends to dominate in this sector. National governments typically set standards
  and priorities for waste management through legislation or regulation. National
  governments also historically have provided funding for major investments, either
  from internal sources or by obtaining loans from multilateral development banks.
  However, all levels of government are involved in waste management and this
  pathway has increasingly expanded to include regional and municipal governments.
  Activities along the government-driven pathway are also expanding to include
  additional actors, especially the private sector and community groups. <br>
  <br>
  In addition, private sector and community-driven pathways are playing more important
  roles in technology transfer within the waste sector. Private entities ranging
  from individual entrepreneurial garbage collectors to large domestic or multinational
  enterprises are participating in waste management operations (Mangal, 1996).
  While the private sector's participation in waste management projects is often
  in government-driven projects, private enterprises are developing independent
  projects as well. Similarly, community groups are beginning to develop projects
  outside of government pathways that support the provision of waste management
  services to local populations. These informal activities are more common in
  developing countries and CEITs, and hold significant promise for the expansion
  of waste management services in the future. As the importance of community involvement
  for successful waste management has become evident, moreover, community groups
  have become more important actors in the government and private sector pathways
  too.<br>
  <br>
  The discussion that follows describes five broad types of actions to encourage
  technology transfer in the waste management sector, and particularly to ensure
  deployment of mitigation technologies. Many of these actions will be most frequently
  employed along the dominant government-driven pathway. However, depending upon
  the specific circumstances of countries, different pathways and actors may be
  involved. <br>
  <br>
  Policy and Regulatory Development: A framework for waste management is essential
  to promote technology transfer in this sector. Activities involving policies
  and regulations are typically government driven, with various government agencies
  responsible for development and implementation. Most often, this framework is
  defined by the national government, with various implementation requirements
  borne by local government agencies (or in some cases, private companies) that
  operate the waste management system.<br>
  <br>
  Extensive technology transfer activities are already underway within countries
  as governments strive to improve their policy and regulatory frameworks for
  waste management. Consideration of policy and regulatory issues can be beneficial
  in all countries. Challenges within regulatory and policy frameworks may be
  particularly acute in developing countries and CEITs, and even more so where
  government agencies and institutional frameworks may be weak. In particular,
  enforcement capabilities may be limited in many developing countries and CEITs.
  Thus, new regulatory frameworks frequently may need to be coupled with capacity
  building programmes aimed at facilitating the effective implementation of policies
  and regulations.<br>
  <br>
  Based on past experience, the most successful frameworks will be those that
  were developed through the participation of many parties, especially those directly
  affected by changes in waste management practices and those directly responsible
  for maintaining the system. If regulatory and policy frameworks for waste management
  are impractical or unachievable, they will not work. Some of the most effective
  frameworks are those that develop integrated approaches toward waste management,
  encouraging a mix of waste management approaches (such as source reduction,
  recycling and appropriate disposal and treatment) that are specifically adapted
  to local conditions (Bartone, 1997). Careful attention to the needs and capabilities
  of those that will implement the policies and regulations is also crucial, in
  order to ensure that the new frameworks are practical.<br>
  <br>
  The involvement of community groups is necessary if the continuing challenges
  of the waste management are to be addressed. Ultimately, the success of any
  waste management system will depend upon the acceptance and participation of
  local populations. Thus, a country's policy and regulatory framework will likely
  be most effective if it reflects the needs and priorities of local populations.
  While the importance of local support might seem most obvious in developing
  countries and CEITs where significant changes in waste disposal practices may
  be required, it is also important for developed countries (Serageldin, 1994).<br>
  <br>
  The involvement of the private sector is also important. In most countries,
  the private sector has not traditionally played a major role in the design of
  regulatory or policy frameworks in the waste management sector. If enhanced
  private sector participation is desired, however, it is essential that appropriate
  legal and regulatory frameworks are put in place (ADB, 1996). Private sector
  feedback to government agencies can greatly improve the effectiveness of policies
  by identifying barriers constraining private investment. Lack of clarity in
  requirements, unclear procedures and timelines for obtaining permits or approvals,
  and overlapping jurisdictions are examples of barriers that can be addressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emphasis on public-private exchanges on regulatory and policy issues can be
  beneficial in all countries. They may be particularly valuable in CEITs and
  developing countries, however, where the private sector may be weak, the judicial
  system less developed, and relations between the private sector and the government
  more tenuous. CEITs, especially, may confront special challenges due to the
  lack of a strong private sector and the suspicion government agencies frequently
  have for private companies. In developing countries, another challenge will
  likely be how to involve the variety of private entities (including micro-enterprises
  and informal groups of individuals) that play essential roles in the waste management
  sector.<br>
  <br>
  Mitigation technologies can be encouraged in many ways through policies and
  regulations. First, governments can directly mandate certain approaches as a
  means of minimising GHG emissions or achieving other environmental benefits.
  In the United States, for example, methane emissions from landfills will be
  reduced by almost 50% by 2000 as a result of a regulatory action taken to reduce
  VOC emissions (USEPA, 1999b). Similarly, methane generation can be reduced through
  government policies or regulations for waste separation or recycling. To date,
  such policies have been motivated by the scarcity of suitable landfill capacity,
  and have had the secondary benefit of reducing GHG emissions. In 1992, for example,
  Australia adopted a National Waste Minimisation and Recycling Strategy, the
  goal of which was to reduce landfilled waste by 50 per cent between 1990 and
  2000. Governments can also modify regulations in other sectors to reduce barriers
  to the use of mitigation technologies in the waste sector. In Japan, for example,
  the national government revised existing regulations in the power sector to
  create a market for energy from waste incineration plants. This action facilitated
  rapid expansion of waste incineration, which has contributed to lower overall
  GHG emissions.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Innovative Financing Approaches</i><sup><small><a href="fn14.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(14,2); return false;"><i>2</i></a></small></sup><br>
  Waste management projects, especially large centralised landfills and wastewater
  treatment plants, can require large investments that traditionally have been
  provided by governments. This approach has limitations, however, particularly
  when financial requirements exceed a government's capabilities. Limited financing
  capacities are most severe in developing countries and CEITs, where local populations
  may lack adequate waste management services and existing infrastructure is deteriorating
  from lack of maintenance. Even in developed countries, however, the costs of
  maintaining and upgrading waste management systems can be high (Serageldin,
  1994). <br>
  <br>
  Both national and local governments are turning to the private sector in this
  era of financial shortages. Some governments are leasing concessions for solid
  waste management services, others are encouraging project finance using end-user
  fees to recoup investment costs, and still others are privatising waste disposal
  and sanitation services (World Bank, 1996). National governments may be able
  to assist municipalities in the development of innovative approaches for attracting
  private sector participation. Attracting private capital can be difficult, however,
  unless the relevant agencies have strong financial management and accounting
  practices, transparent procedures, competitive procurements, and reliable supervisory
  and monitoring capabilities (World Bank, 1996). Where financial management is
  a barrier, the national government may be able to assist municipalities in addressing
  financial weaknesses and attracting private investment. <br>
  <br>
  The municipalities that have dealt most successfully with their increased role
  in waste management have tended to be those that emphasise locally appropriate
  waste management approaches with lower financial requirements. In Badong, Indonesia,
  for instance, a sustainable recycling project employing people who had previously
  scavenged at open dumps was developed as an alternative to the more conventional
  centralised landfill model. By creating a strong recycling industry, needs for
  an expensive landfill were reduced and a variety of secondary markets in recycled
  materials were created (ICLEI, 1997). Similarly, a recent project in Cairo,
  Egypt, focused on no- and low-cost measures for wastewater treatment including
  waste minimisation, and wastewater treatment facilities were installed only
  where necessary. In addition, this project emphasised local design and manufacturing
  of facilities to ensure sustainability (Myllyla, 1995). <br>
  <br>
  If innovative financing approaches are in use for basic waste management services
  within a country, financing should be available for mitigation technologies.
  In many developed countries, mitigation technologies are frequently developed
  by the private sector, with limited direct involvement of government agencies.
  Examples include some recycling programmes and many projects that recover methane
  from landfills. Similar approaches may be replicable in developing countries
  and CEITs, particularly in middle-income cities with strong institutions. Moreover,
  successful technology transfers will likely increase emphasis on alternative
  waste management approaches, which are often very environmentally beneficial.
  It is likely that central governments will continue to underwrite some investments
  in the sector through grants, subsidies, and revenue sharing (World Bank, 1996).
  If appropriate, these government agencies could require that available mitigation
  approaches be employed as a condition of support. <br>
  <br>
  Capacity Building: Efforts to improve the institutional capacity for waste management
  are critical. Many of these activities will be initiated by government agencies,
  but in many cases the target audience may include the private sector and community
  groups. Appropriate capacity building activities are varied, but could include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Training: Training needs are likely to be extremely varied depending on
    national circumstances. For government staff, training aimed at improving
    management and administrative skills may be important, particularly where
    responsibility for waste management programmes is devolving from national
    agencies to lower levels of government. Technology transfer regarding waste
    management options, project finance, and regulatory development and enforcement
    are other examples of possible training needs. Local private companies may
    need management and technical training to assist them in establishing viable
    small enterprises that can implement locally based projects, many of which
    are very environmentally desirable. This type of training may be particularly
    valuable in CEITs and developing countries. It may also be desirable to train
    local community organisations and decision makers in both general waste management
    issues and those issues specific to the project under consideration. Such
    training can ensure that the community understands the project context, is
    committed to the project goals, and has the ability to maintain it. </li>
  <li> Local Assessments: Cooperative assessment activities involving government
    agencies, the private sector, and community representatives should be undertaken
    to determine waste management priorities. Local representatives should participate
    in the assessment and prioritisation of waste management issues, so as to
    ensure that local needs and priorities are incorporated into project design
    and also obtain the support of local populations. In addition, these representatives
    can ensure that the cost of services is in line with the benefits to the population.
    The differences in cost between basic and full waste management services can
    be substantial, for example, and it is important to determine the level of
    service communities want and are willing to pay for before developing the
    system (Serageldin, 1994).</li>
  <li> Information Exchanges: Where waste management systems are changing rapidly
    or new approaches are being piloted within a country, information exchange
    and discussion among a wide range of parties can be valuable. In addition
    to national or regional experts, the involvement of local municipal decision
    makers and administrative staff, NGOs, and community leaders can be important.
    Information exchange can occur through clearinghouses, peer networks, government
    outreach or education programmes, or other means, depending on the type of
    information being shared and the participants. </li>
</ul>
<p> <br>
  Capacity building activities are necessary for all types of waste management
  projects, including those that include mitigation technologies. Depending on
  the extent to which mitigation strategies encourage waste management approaches
  that are more innovative, use newer technologies, or involve more groups, however,
  expanded technical and institutional assistance may be needed.<br>
  <br>
  Incentives: Incentives can encourage specific activities or technologies, and
  can be employed by government to catalyse development of mitigation technologies.
  Incentives can take many forms, including tax breaks, subsidies, preferential
  financing, or expedited regulatory approvals. Incentives can be designed to
  draw attention to desired project types, and to address barriers to project
  implementation. Many incentives affecting mitigation technologies have been
  implemented, although to date few have been explicitly motivated by the desire
  to reduce GHG emissions. In the U.S., for example, methane recovery projects
  at landfills have, at various times, been eligible for tax incentives provided
  by both Federal and state governments, as well as preferential financing and
  streamlined regulatory approvals (USEPA, 1997b). For the most part, these policies
  have been designed to promote renewable energy or to diversify energy supply,
  as opposed to explicitly intending to reduce methane emissions. Similarly, the
  national government of Japan has provided subsidies to local governments for
  construction of waste incineration plants (Tanaka and Ikeguchi, 1998). The policy,
  which was motivated by extremely limited landfill capacity in Japan, has resulted
  in construction of almost 2,000 incinerators.<br>
  <br>
  Voluntary Programmes: Many of the activities described above can be incorporated
  into voluntary programmes,<br>
  which can be used to encourage wider participation in project development, to
  foster better coordination among agencies, or to encourage the consideration
  and implementation of desired technologies. Government agencies at all levels
  may undertake voluntary programmes, depending on the particular barriers to
  be addressed. Voluntary programmes promoting recycling, composting, and waste
  minimisation have also been implemented in many countries with much success.
  The U.S. EPA also uses a voluntary programme to promote methane recovery from
  landfills (USEPA, 1997b).</p>
