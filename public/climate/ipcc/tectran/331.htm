<h1> Case Study 3</h1>
<p> <b>Inner Mongolian Household Wind Electric Systems</b><br>

<p><b>Summary</b><br>
  Since the early 1980s, China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) has achieved 
  widespread local production and dissemination of stand-alone wind electric systems 
  among its rural herding population. The IMAR government has employed a combination 
  of market and state planning mechanisms to create markets, adapt foreign technologies, 
  and develop a unified system of design, manufacturing, distribution, and service. 
  By 1998, 130,000 household wind systems provided electricity to over 500,000 
  people, or one-third of the herding population, and displaced substantial GHG 
  emissions that would otherwise have been produced by coal or diesel alternatives.</p>
<p><b>Background</b><br>
  The Inner Mongolia steppe is inhabited by ethnic Mongolian livestock herders 
  earning US$120 per capita/yr. Because of low population densities (&lt; 3 persons/km2) 
  and high costs, only about 5% of the herding population is served by the regional 
  electric grid or stand-alone diesel generators. To exploit IMAR's abundant wind 
  resources, in 1980 the regional government appointed a high-level New Energy 
  Leading Group (NELG) to oversee development, issuing four guidelines: (a) serve 
  the pastoral population (b) emphasize basic household needs (c) make products 
  &quot;reliable to use, convenient to maintain, and affordable to herders&quot; 
  (d) &quot;local management is the key, with the state providing appropriate 
  support.&quot; (Byrne et al., 1998).</p>
<p><b>Approach</b><br>
  NELG-sponsored task forces and pilot projects brought together the agricultural, 
  finance, and planning ministries, universities, research institutes, factories, 
  local governments, and herders. Technical R&amp;D and economic research produced 
  four important results. First, products were developed that met herders' needs 
  and were manufacturable by local industry. Second, demonstration projects familiarised 
  herders with the technology. Third, key questions about programme implementation 
  were resolved empirically, such as the decision to emphasize private ownership 
  and individual household systems. Fourth, a unified network combining R&amp;D, 
  manufacturing, distribution, and service was created, under the leadership of 
  the IMAR New Energy Office (IMARNEO).</p>
<p>The resulting manufacturing system is diverse. Six factories produce 20 different 
  models of wind generators, from 50W to 7.5kW. The development of reliable low-cost 
  turbines under 200W is a key innovation. Eleven factories manufacture batteries, 
  inverters, and charge controllers. Water-pumping windmills and renewable energy 
  products such as electric fences and DC lights are also produced. Service centres 
  in 60 of IMAR's 88 counties, financially supported by county governments, employ 
  300 technicians who handle distribution, customer education, and service. </p>
<p>Most (&gt;90%) household systems in IMAR include a 100W wind generator, 12V 
  battery, and charge controller. They cost &yen;2000-2500 (US$250-300) and typically 
  power lights, radio, and black-and-white television. Recently, increases in 
  household income have shifted demand toward larger systems, typically including 
  a 300W wind generator and two batteries (US$500-600). New wind/PV hybrid systems 
  supply power more reliably in the summer when wind resources are lowest.</p>
<p>Sales of wind systems are supported by a government subsidy of &yen;200 (US$25) 
  per 100W of capacity, or 10% of typical system cost. Since 1986, the government 
  has provided &yen;26.5 million (US$3 million) in subsidies, peaking at &yen;4 
  million (US$500,000) in 1989 (Li, 1998). Subsidies were initially given directly 
  to households, then to local governments; in both cases, abuses occurred. Since 
  1988 factories have been given the subsidy directly, which is passed on in reduced 
  purchase prices (Lin, 1997).</p>
<p>Technology transfer has centred on local adaptation of foreign products. The 
  design of the Shangdu Livestock Machinery Factory's 100W and 300W turbines, 
  accounting for over 80,000 units in IMAR, grew from a collaboration between 
  SVIAB of Sweden and the Shangdu plant, which produced turbines for SVIAB in 
  return for the technology license. The key development was local design changes 
  that altered the power curve of Shangdu generators, increasing power output 
  at lower wind speeds. This is a crucial adaptation to the steady but low-speed 
  wind resource in IMAR.</p>
<p>Up to 85% of IMAR systems are reported operational. Common problems involve 
  batteries, blades, inverters, and charge controllers. Service centres keep statistics 
  on failure rates. A technical board determines whether frequent failures result 
  from quality defects or design flaws. Manufacturers address quality defects; 
  R&amp;D organisations such as IMAR Polytechnic University address design flaws. 
  Joint ventures with foreign wind turbine and electronics manufacturers are currently 
  being sought to improve blades and inverters.</p>
<p><b>Impacts</b><br>
  (a) The IMAR wind programme has led to dramatic changes in quality of life, 
  providing lighting, conveniences, and access to the outside world for low-income 
  inhabitants of this remote region. A common wedding gift is now a wind generator 
  or television, illustrating the extent of the technology's integration into 
  the pastoral lifestyle. (b) Wind generators displace potential carbon emissions 
  of about 10-15 ktC/yr based on an equivalent amount of electricity produced 
  with diesel generators. </p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  The IMAR programme exemplifies successful government leadership in rural energy 
  using realistic programme guidelines, adequate preparatory research, multiple-stakeholder 
  participation in goal-setting, coordinated use of plan, market, and subsidy, 
  local project control, and adaptive management. Well-targeted subsidies have 
  been effective. Technology transfer has been important, but has served as an 
  adjunct, rather than as a principal driver of the process. </p>
