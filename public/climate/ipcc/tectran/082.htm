<h3><b>4.10.2 Problems associated with equity</b></h3>

  Dealing with equity related issues is not always easy. Clearly if the key goal
  is to reduce GHG emissions, then selecting cost-effective technologies to reduce
  the most emissions with the least possible costs is a key issue. However, as
  illustrated above, such cost-effective and politically viable technology transfer
  may negatively affect some communities within a society. The challenge for the
  international community is to try and make these trade-offs in such a way that
  it also reduces existing imbalances in the society. This becomes even more complicated
  when one realises that empowering poor people, women and the generally neglected
  classes, does not immediately lead to a reduction of GHG emissions, but instead
  to an increase of the emissions as people move out of the poverty trap. This
  is why a key question is: whose development should technology transfer foster?
  Clearly, since there is a shortage of resources, the trade-off between environment
  and social issues is not an easy one.<br>
  <br>
  However, the implementation of technology transfer has been hampered because
  of four reasons (Junne, cited in Gupta, 1997). First, the low GHG emitting &quot;leap-frog
  technologies&quot; are produced in few countries (USA, Japan and Germany), and
  technology transfer schemes facilitating transfer of the best technologies would
  lead to a North-North transfer of financial resources which few other developed
  countries would find acceptable. Second, in identifying the low GHG emitting
  technologies, new conflicts may arise. For example, if France were to promote
  the expansion of nuclear technology, and other countries with advanced coal
  technologies may support the promotion of clean coal technology. Third, cost-effectiveness
  arguments may lead to the transfer of technologies to the most polluting countries
  which may also be the rapidly industrialising countries with comparatively high
  growth rates, leading to a South-South inequity by helping those who need the
  help least at the cost of helping those who need it most. Fourth, ultimately,
  &quot;leap-frog technologies&quot; aim to assist developing countries develop
  quickly, a goal that industrialised countries may also not entirely support.<br>
  <br>
  The domestic equity aspects of technology transfer, though central to the debates
  on appropriate technologies in the 1970s, have not really influenced the climate
  change technology transfer discussions since then. However, there is a good
  case to be made for learning from past mistakes and ensuring that technology
  transfer under the climate change regime enhances the sustainable development
  of the importing countries. <br>
  <br>
  Finally, one way forward is to specifically recognise that there are different
  stakeholders in a society and build assessment mechanisms to test for what could
  be described as 'best social practices'. Such an approach would recognise that
  whilst the market determines technology adoption, markets in developing countries
  are very imperfect and tend to exclude social concerns. In order to better evaluate
  these concerns, the technology can be assessed for its impacts on intended users.
  Conversely, technology could be selected as matched to previously<br>
identified needs. Experiences from different social contexts could in time lead
to general guidelines on 'best social practices' being formulated.<br>
