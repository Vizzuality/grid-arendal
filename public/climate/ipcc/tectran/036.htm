<h1>3.2 Technology Transfer and International Political Context</h1>
<p>The legal, economic and political issues surrounding technology transfer in
  general have been around for a long time. Beginning with the establishment of
  the United Nations, this topic invariably found its place in every international
  agreement that has anything to do with social, economic and environmental issues.
  With the release of the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development
  in 1987 the subject of sustainable development took centre stage in all of the
  international environmental and development initiatives. One major outcome of
  the report was the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
  (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Among other things, the UNCED conference,
  also called the Rio &quot;Earth Summit&quot;, adopted the &quot;Agenda 21&quot;,
  an &quot;action plan&quot; for sustainable development. </p>
<p>Chapter 34 of Agenda 21 addressed the issue of technology transfer, and the
  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed by many countries
  at Rio, contained more specific references in the context of climate change.
  These hard-fought instruments were based on the recognition that all countries
  needed to take action to achieve sustainable development and to address climate
  change, but that developed countries carried the responsibility to lead responses,
  and to assist developing countries towards sustainable development.</p>
<p>Consequently, Article 4.1 of the Convention, defining general commitments for
  all Parties, is complemented by Articles 4.3-4.5, which establish the financial
  responsibilities of countries in Annex II - essentially the OECD countries -
  to assist developing countries to meet their obligations under the Convention,to
  help particularly vulnerable countries to adapt to climate change, and to aid
  these countries with &quot;the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound
  technologies and know-how.&quot; Article 4.7 of FCCC underlines this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The extent to which developing country Parties will effectively implement
    their commitments under the Convention will depend on the effective implementation
    by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related
    to financial resources and transfer of technology, and will take fully into
    account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the
    first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reflected a general perception in developing countries that implementing
  the Convention commitments could mean reducing one's economic growth. In practice,
  certain climate-change-related actions can be beneficial to developing countries.
  For example, measures to improve energy efficiency could support their economic
  growth, and widen the opportunities for transferring more advanced energy technologies
  that could bring multiple benefits, while also limiting their greenhouse gas
  emissions (some developing countries are already taking significant steps in
  this area, as indicated in <a href="036.htm#b31">Box 3.1</a>, and later in this
  Report). </p>

    <td>Many developing countries have adopted legislation for energy efficiency.
      Korea introduced an Energy Use Rationalisation Law (EURL)* in the 1980s
      and has been strengthening its implementation. This EURL was introduced
      to overcome energy dependency on foreign oil after the oil crisis, but it
      also meets objectives of the climate change convention and has contributed
      to reducing the rate of emissions growth. This was possible because it was
      motivated by the economic benefit of improving energy efficiency.
      <p>In Brazil a series of innovative energy efficiency programs are aimed
	toward increasing electricity efficiency. The Brazilian government is
	working with the national electric company, Electrobras, in an innovative
	program called PROCEL, the National Program for Conservation of Electricity.
	PROCEL works with private enterprises to identify and implement options
	for reducing waste and saving power through efficient end-use technology.
	To date, PROCEL has implemented energy-saving programs involving efficient
	motors with adjustable speed drives, improved water pumps and wastewater
	systems, efficient refrigerators, and compact fluorescent lightbulbs.
	These programs allow Electrobras to defer investments that would produce
	greenhouse gas emissions in the future. </p>
      <p>A major national program of demand-side management (DSM) has been instituted
	in the Thai power sector. Coordinated by a government agency but with
	strong support from local utilities and NGOs, this program has reduced
	the rate of growth in electricity demand significantly. Consequently,
	utilities have deferred power plant construction. One of the most successful
	areas of cooperation has been in the lighting sector. The Electricity
	Generating Agency of Thailand (EGAT) has worked with local manufacturers
	and distribution channels to expand the use of &quot;thin-tube&quot; high
	efficiency fluorescent lamps as an alternative to &quot;fat-tube&quot;
	conventional lamps. The new tubes reduce power demand, save fuel, decrease
	emissions, and, because they can be manufactured in-country, place a smaller
	burden on the scarce national reserves of hard currency. In the last four
	years, the Thai DSM program has saved 1,063 gigawatt-hours (GWh), allowed
	the deferment of 242 Mwe of new power plants, and offset almost 800,000
	tons of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> in the lighting sector alone.
	The full national program (including lighting, refrigeration, air conditioning,
	electric motors and commercial building applications) has led to the deferment
	of about 300 MWe of new power plants and offset almost 1.2 million tons
	of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>.</p>

<p>The UNFCCC recognises that economic and social development and poverty eradication
  are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties of
  the Convention. All Parties have a right to, and should promote sustainable
  development. In implementing measures to address climate change and its adverse
  effects, the provision of the necessary financial resources and transfer of
  technology to developing countries is essential. Articles 4.3, 4.5, and 4.7
  of the UNFCCC embody these commitments. </p>
<p>The UNFCCC also recognises that the climate change issue can be addressed through
  emission mitigation measures and adaptation measures. However, adaptation has
  played only a marginal part in the reports produced by IPCC so far. This is
  reflected on the attention given to adaptation technology development and its
  transfer. One view is that adaptation technologies help local people adapt because
  of the perceived local impact. Emphasis has therefore been on mitigation technologies
  which are seen as contributing to the solution to the global problem of climate
  change. All this is reflected in the little attention given to activating the
  CoP1 decisions on adaptation (see also <a href="079.htm">Section 4.10</a> in
  <a href="051.htm">Chapter 4</a> for a further discussion).</p>
<p>The diversity of issues means that attention at all levels of society is relevant.
  National Environmental Education Programs emphasise public participation in
  the solutions to environmental problems. Just as in the National Innovation
  Systems and those of Environmental Impact Evaluation (which also offer possibilities
  to involve citizen participation), such programmes can identify and support
  actions related to technology transfer/climatic change, referring also to recommendations
  of Agenda 21. Article 6 of the Convention specifically addresses the role education,
  training and public awareness-raising have in addressing climate change issues.
</p>
<p>Internationally, the ISO 14000 series of environmental management standards
  can foster a greater ecological conscience in industrial sectors, and with this
  enhance the transfer and application of environmentally sound technologies (UN,
  1997). In addition, sectoral initiatives and agreements can also be relevant
  to technology transfer and global dissemination, particularly for sectors (like
  vehicles and electric power generation) in which production of leading technology
  is concentrated in relatively few global companies.</p>
