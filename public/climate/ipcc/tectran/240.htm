<h3> 12.4.2 Technology Transfer within non-Annex I Countries</h3>
<p> In the forestry sector, technology transfer within non-Annex I countries (largely
  referring to tropical countries) is crucial (<a href="238.htm#t124">Table 12.4</a>).
  Forests in most countries are largely controlled and managed by the forest departments.
  Thus, government will be the dominant actor for promoting technology transfer.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Government initiated mechanisms and measures:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li> Regulations on timber extraction companies for practicing sustainable logging</li>
  <li> Enforcing forest conservation regulations and adoption of effective monitoring
    techniques </li>
  <li> Removing subsidies for deforestation</li>
  <li> Financial incentives for adopting SFM and particularly for reduced impact
    logging practices</li>
  <li> Funding capacity building in R&amp;D institutions for technology generation
    as well as assimilation of imported technology </li>
  <li> Training in sustainable logging and management practices for forest department
    and timber logging companies</li>
  <li> Strengthening forest extension services</li>
  <li> Formation of Protected Areas</li>
  <li> Framing policies on land and product tenures to promote community participation</li>
  <li> Establishing linkage between research institutions and forest department
  </li>
  <li> Creating awareness regarding the potential for mitigation projects, costs,
    and benefits (private, local and global), sources of funding and technology
  </li>
  <li> Understanding, recording, and adopting indigenous forest conservation and
    management practices</li>
  <li> Increasing financial allocation to environmental education programmes</li>
  <li> Setting up agencies to assist local groups (NGOs, farmers' organisations,
    local forest departments and even industries) to generate forest-sector mitigation
    project proposals</li>
  <li> Creating technical capacity for monitoring of forest areas and status for
    assessing impacts of removal of subsidies to deforestation, on causes of deforestation
    and the likely effects of different measures intended to reduce it</li>
  <li> Assigning economic valuation to forest services, such as biodiversity,
    soil and water conservation, etc., and collecting carbon tax from potential
    beneficiaries such as farmers and industries.</li>
</ul>
<p> Funding for forestry research and development needs to be increased substantially,
  as usually the forestry sector competes poorly with agriculture; for example
  in Mexico, 98% of subsidies still go to promote agriculture rather than forestry
  (SEMARNAP, 1996). Licensing of logging companies or timber export organisations
  could be linked to adoption of reduced impact logging techniques. Strong forest
  conservation policies are required. India passed a Forest Conservation Act in
  1980, under which conversion of forest land is highly regulated. The area under
  forest has begun to stabilise in India, as deforestation rates have declined
  and conversion of forest land to agriculture has nearly stopped (Ravindranath
  and Hall, 1994). The result is that there is a shift in sourcing industrial
  wood from forests to private farm based plantations. Protected Areas account
  for 15% of forests globally (FAO, 1995). There is a large potential to increase
  the protected area coverage. Appropriate legislation is required to demarcate
  new Protected Areas. This would necessitate adoption of protected-area management
  practices based on experience from other protected areas. It may be possible
  to legislate to ensure that a certain percentage of newsprint is recycled even
  in developing countries, to conserve forests and in turn the C sinks. Thus,
  regulations on forest conversion, harvest of forest products and its processing
  could automatically ensure diffusion of forest conservation, sustainable forest
  management and processing technologies.<br>
  <i><br>
  Diffusion of technology from R&amp;D institutions to forest departments</i>.
  The focus of forest departments in most countries, particularly tropical countries,
  is on forest protection, afforestation and enforcing regulations. They will
  also continue to implement mitigation projects. R&amp;D, however, is a low-priority
  area in these organisations. Forest departments in most tropical countries,
  being the dominant agency involved in forest protection and afforestation, will
  require input of technology. These departments are unlikely to be driven by
  profit motive. However, to maximise returns (monetary, as well as environmental,
  such as bio-diversity conservation) forest departments could adopt efficient
  management say for Protected Areas, silvicultural for afforestation and (reduced
  impact) logging practices. The national governments, particularly ministries
  in charge of the forest department, could evolve national mechanisms to promote
  closer interaction between R&amp;D institutions (government, university and
  industry) and the local forest departments to promote technology transfer.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Private sector</i>. Linkages between industry and farmers is one of the most
  important emerging pathways for future technology transfer. The degraded farmland
  in many countries, has a large potential for forestry mitigation projects (Ravindranath
  and Hall, 1995; Sathaye and Ravindranath, 1998). Both industry and farmers are
  driven by the profit motive. The goals for promoting ''farm forestry'' and agroforestry
  could be; firstly, to grow biomass for meeting rural, urban, industrial and
  export needs to reduce pressure on forests (ultimately conserving C sinks);
  secondly, to create new sinks of C particularly in sawn timber from trees on
  farms and fruit trees on farm lands and; thirdly, to grow biomass feedstock
  for bioenergy utilities. Industry needs to have in-house R&amp;D or could access
  technology from the research institutions within the countries. The role of
  industry is crucial in facilitating technology transfer to a large number of
  small and dispersed farmers. Technology transfer could be facilitated as a part
  of a package from industry to farmers including; credit, technology and marketing
  arrangements. <br>
  <br>
  <i>Community initiated</i>. NGOs in developing countries could create public
  awareness regarding forest conservation, SFM practices, recycling and their
  local and global implications, to ensure compliance with legislation and policies
  by the government departments, industries, timber logging and exporting companies.
  Forestry extension service is very poorly developed compared to agricultural
  extension service thus NGOs could play a major role. An example of an NGO driven
  large scale revegetation programme, involving Tree Growers Cooperatives, is
  given in <a href="240.htm#b121">Box 12.1</a> (see also <a href="353.htm">Case Study 25</a>).<br>

      <p>National Tree Growers Cooperative Federation Limited (NTGCF) is an NGO
	based in India. It was established in 1988 with the main objective to
	restore the degraded and marginalised village lands. The NTGCF has been
	operating in six states of India since 1986. Professionals from forestry,
	social and economic sectors work together to achieve this goal. A participatory
	approach is adopted by the NTGCF to create self-sustaining village cooperatives
	called the Tree Growers Cooperative Society (TGCS). The TGCS works towards
	restoring the biological productivity of marginally productive and unproductive
	degraded lands, establish ecologically self-sustained fuelwood and fodder
	plantations to meet the essential needs of the villagers, and also cater
	to the urban demand for fuelwood, timber and tree based products through
	ecologically sustainable modes. The NTGCF provides financial assistance
	and organises training, extension and orientation programmes for the rural
	communities to revegetate the degraded village lands. As of March 1998,
	the NTGCF has revegetated 8911 hectares of land with a carbon sequestration
	potential of about 14258 tC. If TGCS' concept is extended to cover all
	the degraded village commons of 11.8 x 10<sup>6</sup> ha, the annual C sequestered
	could be 19 MtC. Revegetation under the growers cooperative concept will
	ultimately lead to forest C sink conservation.</p>

<p><i>
  Technology transfer with multiple actors</i>. The foregoing discussion covers
  the role of different technology transfer mechanisms separately. However, in
  practice pathways are often composed of complementary links among the actors
  (government, private sector, NGOs). An example is the social forestry programmes
  in India. During the 1980s, these programmes were exclusively promoted by the
  government forest department. From the early 1990s the programmes were promoted
  on village communal land by NGOs, such as the National Tree Growers' Cooperative
  Federation (NTGCF), and on private farms by industries, mainly for pulp (Ravindranath
  and Hall, 1995).</p>
