<p><b>Afforestation</b><br>
  Artificial establishment of forest stands on lands that previously have not
  supported forests for more than 50 years.</p>
<p><b>Agenda 21</b><br>
  Blueprint for sustainable development into the 21st Century. Its basis was agreed
  during the &quot;Earth Summit&quot; at Rio in 1992, and signed by 179 Heads
  of State and Government.</p>
<p><b>Agreement </b><br>

  embodying such a contract. The term is used to denote one of the five basic
  stages of technology transfer as defined in this Report.</p>
<p><b>Annex I Countries</b><br>
  The countries listed in the Annex I to the UN Framework Convention on Climate
  Change that, as Parties, are committed to adopt national policies and take measures
  to mitigate climate change. Annex I Parties consist of the 24 original countries
  belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
  the European Union and countries designated as Economies in Transition. </p>
<p><b>Annex II Countries </b><br>
  The countries listed in Annex II to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
  These countries have a special obligation to help developing countries with
  financial and technological resources. They include the 24 original OECD members
  plus the European Union.</p>
<p><b>Anthropogenic </b><br>
  Derived from human activities. </p>
<p><b>Assessment </b><br>
  Determination of the importance, size, or other characteristics of a country
  or entity's technology <br>
  needs, market opportunities for technology transfer. The term is used to denote
  one of the five basic stages of technology transfer as defined in this Report.</p>

  Increasing skilled personnel and technical and institutional capacity.</p>
<p><b>Carbon Dioxide </b><br>
  The greenhouse gas whose concentration is being most affected directly by human
  activities. CO<span class="subscript">2</span> also serves as the reference to compare all other greenhouse
  gases (see carbon dioxide equivalents). The major source of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions is
  fossil fuel combustion. CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions are also a product of forest clearing,
  biomass burning, and non-energy production processes such as cement production.</p>

  This family of anthropogenic compounds includes chlorofluorcarbons (CFCs), bromofluorcarbons
  (halons), methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, methyl bromide, and hydrochlorofluorcarbons
  (HCFCs). These compounds have been shown to deplete stratospheric ozone, and
  therefore are typically referred to as ozone depleting substances. The most
  ozone-depleting of these compounds are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol.</p>
<p><b>Clean Development Mechanism </b><br>
  Possible agreements between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties as defined in Article
  12 of the Kyoto Protocol to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><b>Climate Change </b><br>
  The term 'climate change' is sometimes used to refer to all forms of climatic
  inconsistency, but because the Earth's climate is never static, the term is
  more properly used to imply a significant change from one climatic condition
  to another. In some cases, 'climate change' has been used synonymously with
  the term, 'global warming'; scientists however, tend to use the term in the
  wider sense to also include natural changes in climate.</p>

  Actions conducive to mitigating climate change.</p>
<p><b>Climate Safe </b><br>
  Actions conducive to adapting to climate change.</p>
<p><b>Community Driven Pathways </b><br>

  with a high degree of collective decision-making.</p>
<p><b>Conference of the Parties </b><br>
  The Conference of the Parties (CoP) is the collection of nations which have
  ratified the Framework Convention on Climate Change, currently over 170 strong.
  The primary role of the CoP is to keep the implementation of the Convention
  under review and to take the decisions necessary for the effective implementation
  of the Convention.</p>

  group of people to others by contact.</p>
<p><b>Economic Potential </b><br>
  The portion of the technical potential for adapting to or mitigation climate
  change that could be achieved cost-effectively in the absence of market barriers.
  The achievement of the economic potential requires additional policies and measures
  to break down market barriers.</p>

  A level of emission that under law may not be exceeded.</p>
<p> <b><br>
  Environmentally Sound Technologies </b><br>
  Technologies which protect the environment, are less polluting, use all resources
  in a more sustainable manner, recycle more of their wastes and products, and
  handle residual wastes in a more acceptable manner than the technologies for
  which they were substitutes and are compatible with nationally determined socio-economic,
  cultural and environmental priorities. In this Report environmentally sound
  technologies imply mitigation and adaptation technologies. The term includes
  hard and soft technologies.</p>
<p><b>Evaluation </b><br>
  Determination by careful appraisal of the profitability and quality of a technology
  transferred, the appropriateness of the technology to a local situation, and
  other results of a project or program. The term is used to denote one of the
  five basic stages of technology transfer as defined in this Report.</p>
<p><b>Externalities </b><br>

  environment, where those impacts are not reflected in market prices. The costs
  (or benefits) associated with externalities do normally not enter standard cost
  accounting schemes.</p>

  and perfluorcarbons (PFCs).</p>
<p><b>Foreign Direct Investment </b><br>
  Capital invested for the purpose of acquiring a long term interest in an enterprise
  and of exerting a degree of influence on that enterprise's operations.</p>
<p><b>Framework Convention on Climate Change </b><br>
  The international treaty signed at the United Nations Conference on Environment
  and Development (UNCED) at Rio in 1992. The UN Framework Convention on Climate
  Change (FCCC) commits signatory countries to stabilize anthropogenic (i.e.,
  human-induced) greenhouse gas concentrations to 'levels that would prevent dangerous
  anthropogenic interference with the climate system'. The FCCC also requires
  that all signatory Parties develop and update national inventories of anthropogenic
  emissions of all greenhouse gases not otherwise controlled by the Montreal Protocol.
</p>
<p><b>Full-cost Pricing </b><br>
  The pricing of commercial goods - such as electric power - that would include
  in the final prices faced by the end user not only the private costs of inputs,
  but also the costs of the externalities created by their production and use.</p>
<p><b>General Circulation Model </b><br>
  A global, three-dimensional computer model of the climate system which can be
  used to simulate human-induced climate change. GCMs are highly complex and they
  represent the effects of such factors as reflective and absorptive properties
  of atmospheric water vapor, greenhouse gas concentrations, clouds, annual and
  daily solar heating, ocean temperatures and ice boundaries. The most recent
  GCMs include global representations of the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface.</p>
<p><b>Global Warming</b><br>
  An increase in the near surface temperature of the Earth. Global warming has
  occurred in the distant past as the result of natural influences, but the term
  is most often used to refer to the warming predicted to occur as a result of
  increased emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p><b>Global Warming Potential </b><br>

  through the Earth's atmosphere, but prevent most of the outgoing infra-red radiation
  from the surface and lower atmosphere from escaping into outer space. </p>
<p><b>Greenhouse Gas </b><br>
  Any gas that absorbs infra-red radiation in the atmosphere.</p>
<p><b>Greenhouse Gas Reduction Potential</b><br>

  hydrocarbons. Some hydrocarbon compounds are major air pollutants. </p>
<p><b>Hydrofluorocarbons </b><br>
  Chemicals (along with perfluorocarbons) introduced as alternatives to ozone
  depleting substances in serving many industrial, commercial, and personal needs.
  HFCs are emitted as by-products of industrial processes and are also used in
  manufacturing. They do not significantly deplete the stratospheric ozone layer,
  but they are powerful greenhouse gases.</p>
<p><b>Implementation</b><br>
  Carrying out; giving practical effect to and ensuring of actual fulfillment
  of technology transfer processes by concrete measures. The term is used to denote
  one of the five basic stages of technology transfer as defined in this Report.</p>
<p><b>Infra-red Radiation </b><br>
  The heat energy that is emitted from all solids, liquids, and gases. In the
  context of the greenhouse issue, the term refers to the heat energy emitted
  by the Earth's surface and its atmosphere. Greenhouse gases strongly absorb
  this radiation in the Earth's atmosphere, and reradiate some back towards the
  surface, creating the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p><b>Innovation </b><br>

  in 1988. The purpose of the IPCC is to assess information in the scientific
  and technical literature related to all significant components of the issue
  of climate change. The IPCC draws upon hundreds of the world's expert scientists
  as authors and thousands as expert reviewers. Leading experts on climate change
  and environmental, social, and economic sciences from all over the world have
  helped the IPCC to prepare periodic assessments of the scientific underpinnings
  for understanding global climate change, its consequences and potential adaptation
  and mitigation responses. </p>

<p><b>Nitrogen Oxides </b><br>
  Gases consisting of one atom of nitrogen and varying numbers of oxygen atoms.
  Nitrogen oxides are produced in the emissions of vehicle exhausts and from power
  stations. In the atmosphere, nitrogen oxides can contribute to formation of
  photochemical ozone (smog) which is a greenhouse gas. </p>
<p><b>Nitrous Oxide </b><br>

  the use of commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric
  acid production, and biomass burning.</p>
<p><b>No Regret Measures </b><br>

  developing countries as its main objective and 2) is concessional in character,
  with a grant element of at least 25 percent.</p>
<p><b>Ozone </b><br>
  Ozone consists of three atoms of oxygen bonded together in contrast to normal
  atmospheric oxygen which consists of two atoms of oxygen. Ozone is an important
  greenhouse gas found in both the stratosphere (about 90% of the total atmospheric
  loading) and the troposphere (about 10%). Ozone has other effects beyond acting
  as a greenhouse gas. In the stratosphere, ozone provides a protective layer
  shielding the Earth from ultraviolet radiation and subsequent harmful health
  effect on humans and the environment. In the troposphere, oxygen atoms in ozone
  combine with other chemicals and gases (oxidization) to cause smog.</p>
<p><b>Particulates </b><br>

  adapting to or mitigating climate change through the use of technologies and
  measures.</p>
<p><b>Private Sector Driven Pathways </b><br>
  Technology transfers primarily between commercially oriented private-sector
  entities.</p>
<p><b>Radiative Forcing </b><br>
  A change in the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infra-red
  radiation. Without any radiative forcing, solar radiation coming to the Earth
  would continue to be approximately equal to the infra-red radiation emitted
  from the Earth. The addition of greenhouse gases traps and increased fraction
  of the infra-red radiation, reradiating it back toward the surface and creating
  a warming influence (i.e., positive radiative forcing because incoming solar
  radiation will exceed outgoing infra-red radiation).</p>
<p><b>Reforestation </b><br>
  Forest stands established artificially on lands that have supported forests
  within the last 50 years.</p>
<p><b>Regulatory Measures </b><br>

  is often stored in ocean water, plants, or soils, from where it can be released
  at a later time. </p>
<p><b>Solar Radiation</b><br>
  Energy from the Sun. Also referred to as short-wave radiation. Of importance
  to the climate system, solar radiation includes ultra-violet radiation, visible
  radiation, and infra-red radiation.</p>
<p><b>Stakeholders </b><br>

  characteristics, test methods, rules for use).</p>
<p><b>Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice </b><br>
  UNFCCC committee serving as the link between the information and assessments
  provided by expert sources (such as the IPCC) on the one hand, and the policy-oriented
  needs of the CoP on the other.</p>
<p><b>Sulfur Dioxide </b><br>
  A compound composed of one sulfur and two oxygen atoms. Sulfur dioxide emitted
  into the atmosphere through natural and anthropogenic processes is changed in
  a complex series of chemical reactions in the atmosphere to sulfate aerosols.

  or practice in all applications in which it could technically be adopted, without
  consideration of its costs or practical feasibility.</p>
<p><b>Technology </b><br>
  A piece of equipment, technique, practical knowledge or skills for performing
  a particular activity.</p>
<p><b>Technology Transfer </b><br>
  The broad set of processes covering the exchange of knowledge, money and goods
  amongst different stakeholders that lead to the spreading of technology for
  adapting to or mitigating climate change. In an attempt to use the broadest
  and most inclusive concept possible, the Report uses the word 'transfer' to
  encompass both diffusion of technologies and cooperation across and within countries.</p>
<p> <br>
  <b>Volatile Organic Compound </b><br>
  The term used to describe the organic gases and vapours that are present in
  the air. They are believed to be involved in ground-level ozone formation. Some
