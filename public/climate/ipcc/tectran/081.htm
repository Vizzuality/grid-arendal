<p><i>Rural versus urban</i><br>
  Within the emission limitation context, when decisions are taken to support 
  technology transfers to reduce emissions, the application of the cost-effectiveness 
  principle tends to imply that priority is given to technologies that can reduce 
  emissions quickly and efficiently and where there is a strong vested interest. 
  Inevitably, this implies that technologies that serve urban interests may get 
  prioritised in the process. As the majority of technology transfer is from industrialised 
  to developing countries, it might benefit a minority of elite rich: industrialists 
  and investors in the advanced industrialised countries and a small group of 
  wealthy political and economic elite in the recipient countries (Leys, 1975). 
  The technology transferred is usually capital-intensive, and the products are 
  directed toward urban middle and upper class consumption. With emphasis on export-oriented 
  industrial production in many Third World countries, the development of domestic 
  markets that would imply spreading greater wealth (and purchasing power) among 
  the poorer classes is a low priority. Technology transfer in the agricultural 
  sector also tends to benefit wealthier farmers with larger land holdings, often 
  to the detriment of poorer, small landholders and landless tenants. The Green 
  Revolution, touted as one of the great successes of technological development 
  to improve agricultural production and food resources, was based on newly developed 
  grain seeds that required high amounts of chemical fertiliser that only wealthier 
  farmers could afford (Chambers, 1983; Pearse, 1980; Stewart, 1997). Even those 
  whose concerns might be broader, who work in the public sector or for NGOs, 
  have a strong urban bias. Planners, even those working on rural development 
  and natural resource issues, rarely live in rural areas. Their offices and homes 
  are in cities. Meetings and paperwork dominate their jobs. Their needs, and 
  their perspectives, are tainted by their daily urban experiences (Chambers, 
  1983). It is difficult for many urban residents to communicate with rural people. 
  The former look down upon the latter: it is easier to plan development activities 
  FOR villagers than plan WITH them. The challenge is to find ways and means to 
  ensure that technology transfers are also used to address relevant rural issues 
  effectively.<br>
  <i><br>
  Exclusion of poor social classes and ethnic minorities</i><br>
  Another bias that sometimes creeps in, is the bias against ethnic minorities. 
  The relationship between dominant ethnic groups and non-dominant ethnic minorities 
  in a country lends further complexity to the issue of technology transfer. Ethnic 
  minorities are often viewed as &quot;outsiders&quot; to the national society, 
  so little effort is made by members of the dominant ethnic group to communicate 
  effectively with the minorities. This leads to frequent miscommunication on 
  transfer of technologies with the ethnic minorities (Black, 1991). The unique 
  identities of ethnic minorities are frequently tied to their use of &quot;traditional&quot; 
  forms of technology. New technologies introduced by or through the dominant 
  culture may be seen by ethnic minorities as &quot;alien&quot; to their own culture 
  and identity (Bebbington, 1997). <br>
  <br>
  Many analysts have noted the relationship between social class and the location 
  of polluting activities, including those that emit GHGs. Many polluting activities 
  are sited where poor, politically powerless, and socially deprived groups of 
  people reside (Cable and Cable, 1995). The large thermoelectric plant in Catano 
  in Northeast Puerto Rico is an example of environmental degradation of energy 
  projects. The plant discharges toxic waste into the sea and surrounding land, 
  damages the health of nearby residents with its gas emissions, while producing 
  electricity mainly for commercial and industrial uses in distant cities (Meyn, 
  1997). Plans to build a similar plant in another corner of the island have been 
  met with extensive protests by local residents. A central authority made the 
  plans, with no consultation with the people where the plant was to have been 
  built. In 1993, after four years of protests and struggle, the local residents 
  and other island-wide environmental groups forced the government to cancel the 
  proposed thermoelectric plant. Several community organisations have since formed 
  an environmental coalition to formulate alternative energy plans, by using renewable 
  resources, through storage of excess generation during slack periods, and by 
  increasing efficiency of existing plants (Meyn, 1997). The bias of technology 
  transfer toward vested interests is reflected in transportation policies that 
  favour roads and expanded use of private vehicles over public transportation. 
  This implies that technologies transferred may often end up being sited in the 
  poorer neighbourhoods, or alternatively that poor neighbourhoods grow around 
  such technology sites and may have serious environmental impacts on the local 
  people.<br>
  <br>
  In serving certain vested interests, other interests may get neglected. Thus, 
  large dams have led to huge displacements of the local people and of animals. 
  Large-scale energy schemes and the extraction of natural resources (mining, 
  logging) are rarely planned with the consensus of the local population. Rather 
  than accruing some of the benefits to local residents, these schemes more often 
  lead to considerable destruction of local environments, dispossession of people 
  from their lands, and displacement of people. Dams and hydroelectric power stations 
  lead to displacement - the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada will affect at 
  least 100,000 people by submerging their homes with another 140,000 people to 
  be adversely affected by the canal system<sup><small><a href="fn6.htm#3" onClick="showFootnote(6,3); return false;">3</a></small></sup> 
  (Sen, 1995). Displacement and dispossession is possible when people do not offer 
  resistance, and when they have not been consulted about the problem and included 
  in the process to find a solution. <br>
  <br>
  <i>Gender bias</i><br>
  The selection of technologies often has a strong gender impact. As a result 
  of the social position of a woman in a society, her needs may be shaped in different 
  ways. Technology transfer may either lead to empowering women (Jain, 1985) by 
  meeting needs of women in their productive, reproductive and community management 
  roles, or it may lead to dis-empowering women by displacing their role in the 
  society (Mies and Shiva, 1993). Thus, technology can be an opportunity for women 
  when it provides them with greater income, reduced health risks and greater 
  security and autonomy, or it can be a threat to the livelihoods of women, when 
  the transfer of technology leads to processes in which men take over the traditional 
  work of women (Everts, 1998). This may happen if women are not fully involved 
  in the technological innovation process.<br>
  <br>
  Formal interventions in the rural energy sector in India have traditionally 
  been implemented in a manner that normally treats the actual users, i.e. local 
  communities, as either 'data sources' or as 'beneficiaries', but rarely as full 
  partners in the design, adaptation, and implementation processes. It is being 
  recognised that one of the reasons for the inconsistent performance of these 
  programmes is that the local communities and grassroots organisations are not 
  adequately involved in the planning, implementation, and follow-up aspects of 
  these programmes. The other serious shortcoming is the total absence of a role 
  for women in these processes notwithstanding the fact that the women are usually 
  the providers, users and managers of energy in rural areas (Malhotra et al., 
  1998, p. 12-13). Specific evidence that interventions may actually have perverse 
  effects is provided by the fuel-wood crisis (Agarwal, 1991). Women in South 
  Asia cook on fuel-wood which they cut from nearby forests and trees. Although 
  governments have promoted social forestry schemes, if the ownership of such 
  social forestry schemes is such that the poor women have no access to the wood, 
  such schemes may not benefit the poor households nor the environment. Once fuelwood 
  becomes part of the monetised economy, women are often excluded as men typically 
  make decisions of a financial nature (Malhotra et al., 1998). One can recommend 
  an adaptation of Everts' (1998) approach to integrating gender (see <a href="#b49">Box 
  4.9</a>).<br>

    <td> Most actors in the climate change and technology transfer debate are 
      not very familiar with gender related issues. The first step in such a process 
      is to create gender awareness in the actors involved. This implies creating 
      an understanding of how women as a social group benefit or lose from technology 
      transfer and developmental initiatives, as opposed to assuming that men 
      and women within specific social groups share the benefits and losses equally. 
      The second step calls for undertaking the Efficient Gender Analysis (EGA) 
      method. This method involves the formulation of 13 questions which aim to 
      make explicit the implicit gender-specific objectives of a particular technology 
      transfer project, to analyse the impacts on women and to formulate recommendations 
      that would facilitate the effective inclusion of women in the process. The 
      third step calls for the collection of context relevant specific gender 
      related information which can be included in the recommendations on how 
      to minimise the adverse impacts on women, and to empower them in the process 
      of transferring technologies to reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions.

Finally, one way forward is to specifically recognise that there are different 
stakeholders in a society and build assessment mechanisms to test for 'best social 
practices'. Although one acknowledges that it is the market that determines which 
technology is adopted, on the other hand, markets in developing countries are 
frequently very imperfect and tend to exclude social concerns. In order to better 
evaluate these concerns, the technology can be assessed for the community/private 
sector or government for which it is targeted. In such an approach the social 
actors are identified after the identification of the technology. Or, government/private 
sector/community needs are identified and appropriate technologies to meet those 
needs are sought out. It is important to recognise that there is a range of interest 
groups involved. Experiences from different social contexts need to be evaluated 
in order to generate generalisations of possible best social practices which can 
then be applied in relation to each individual case of technology transfer.<br>
