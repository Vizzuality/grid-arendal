<h3>12.3.3 Climate Mitigation Related Pathways </h3>
<p>A number of new mechanisms have emerged in the forestry sector for technology
  transfer, including the concept of joint implementation and emissions trading.
  With the advent of the Kyoto Protocol, the Clean Development Mechanism has also
  emerged as a multilateral entity which will significantly influence forestry
  sector technology transfer and finance (Bolin, 1998). New brokerage, as well
  as monitoring and verification institutions are also emerging associated to
  climate change institutions and mechanisms. </p>
<p>GEF. The Global Environmental Facility (GEF) is a financial mechanism that
  promotes international cooperation and fosters actions to protect the global
  environment. The grants and concessional funds disbursed, complement traditional
  development assistance by covering the additional costs (also known as 'agreed
  incremental costs') incurred when a national, regional, or global development
  project also targets global environmental objectives. Forestry does not appear
  among the operational programmes in the current phase of GEF, though it appears
  under the short-term measures. However, fossil fuel substitution through bioenergy,
  fuelwood conservation and bioelectricity systems for decentralised application
  are included in the operational programmes. In addition, the majority of biodiversity
  conservation projects also contribute to C abatement. GEF operational programme-12
  on carbon sequestration is being currently formulated. Under this programme,
  GEF can facilitate transfer of technology to near commercial forestry sector
  projects that face incremental risk, and hence justify funding the incremental
  cost of undertaking a forestry sector initiative over its relevant growth cycle.
  Furthermore, this GEF programme can address the barriers and impediments to
  widespread implementation of viable carbon sequestration opportunities, addressing
  risks and risk financing. GEF initiatives can prepare an environment for replication
  and sustainable continuation of activities. By breaking a first time barrier,
  it can pave the way for the flow of private sector resources that can be coupled
  with international initiatives.</p>
<p>AIJ/CDM/JI. At the first UN-FCCC Conference of the Parties, Berlin, 1995, the
  Parties established a pilot technology transfer programme, termed the 'Activities
  Implemented Jointly (AIJ)'. To date, over 70 countries have established government
  institutions to develop and monitor AIJ projects. Over 50 projects have been
  registered with the UN-FCCC Secretariat. The US Initiative on Joint Implementation
  (US-IJI) is the largest AIJ pilot programme, with 32 projects in 12 countries.
  US-IJI has attracted over US$160 million in private sector finance. Approximately
  one-half of the US projects are in the forestry sector. For example, private
  sector partners from the US and Bolivia are working under the AIJ pilot phase
  to establish the largest private sector national park in the world. However,
  there are uncertainties regarding the inclusion of land use change and forestry
  activities under CDM. Market-based trading of carbon credit could enhance the
  flow of resources to forestry projects worldwide. It is also not clear how this
  would affect other aspects like biodiversity and local needs, and there are
  many other uncertainties, like those associated with carbon-accounting and the
  life-time of the carbon-stock. To clarify these aspects and uncertainties the
  IPCC will issue its Special Report on Land-Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry
  in 2000 (<a href="041.htm">Sections 3.4</a> and <a href="048.htm">3.6</a> in
  <a href="033.htm">Chapter 3</a> provide more information on technology transfer
  in the Kyoto Protocol and other UNFCCC agreements).</p>
