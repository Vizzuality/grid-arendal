<h3>5.5.3 Technology Partnership Programmes</h3>
<p> Technology transfer aimed at fostering mitigation and adaptation responses
  to climate change will be most effective where it engages all key stakeholders
  in designing and implementing technology transfer actions. These key stakeholders
  include in-country and international private businesses and investors, government
  agencies, and bilateral and multilateral donor organisations. While private
  businesses play the key role in implementing most technology transfer activities,
  national governments and international donor agencies can help remove market
  barriers and set conditions to ensure effective private sector participation
  in technology transfer. Technology transfer activities will be most effective
  where businesses, governments, and donor organisations collaborate in designing
  and implementing these activities to make the most productive use of their respective
  resources and authorities.<br>
  <br>
  Since climate change is not explicitly considered in most development plans,
  climate change considerations are not fully integrated into the development
  plans that shape markets for new technologies. In many cases, consideration
  of climate change issues will only require marginal adjustment to development
  plans, but this process of adjustment and review is critical in ensuring that
  development programmes contribute to climate change goals. Therefore, it is
  important for climate change technology transfer activities to respond to developing
  country determination of what type of technology transfer will best contribute
  to their development needs while also addressing climate change. Once these
  technology transfer priorities are well understood, developing countries can
  work with the private sector and the international donor community to facilitate
  technology transfer activities to respond to these priorities. <br>
  <br>
  Technology partnerships can also be exclusively at a firm (company) level. The
  United Nations (1996, p.x) has suggested that &quot;firms in many developing
  countries--the least developed ones in particular--often do not have the funds,
  trained human resources or infrastructure to pursue a technology-based innovation
  process on their own. In such cases a level of cooperation is needed that is
  qualitatively different from that associated with traditional technology transfer.
  Technology partnership (TP) is one opportunity for participation by developing
  countries' firms in the emerging forms of technological alliances and cooperation.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The essential characteristics of technology partnerships between enterprises
  from industrial and developing countries are typically the following: (a) they
  are long-term arrangements; (b) they are mutually beneficial; (c) they contain
  an explicit commitment to cooperation; (d) they have as one of their central
  goals the learning process of both partners; (e) they occur within a technology
  system and within specific economic relations; (f) they enhance the level and
  depth of both partners' technological capabilities (UN, 1996).<br>
  <br>
  One recent example of a technology partnership programme is the Technology Cooperation
  Agreement Pilot Project by the U.S. government (see <a href="111.htm#b55">Box
  5.5</a>). Another example is the Technology Partnership Initiative, run in the
  United Kingdom by the Joint Environmental Markets Unit of the DTI and DETR.
  Joint demonstration projects of many kinds represent another form of technology
  partnership; one example is the project in Brazil by a consortium of twelve
  companies, including private and public Brazilian enterprises and multinational
  firms, to develop a biomass gasifier/gas turbine power plant designed to use
  wood chips as fuel. The consortium was created by the joint entrepreurship of
  foundations, industry associations, and government entities (Norberg-Bohm and
  Hart, 1995). And the multilateral &quot;Climate Technology Initiative&quot;
  has established a programme called &quot;Technology Cooperation Implementation
  Plans&quot; (TCIP) to carry out a number of partnerships (UNFCCC, 1999).<br>

      <p>In 1997, the U.S. Government launched the Technology Cooperation Agreement
	Pilot Project (TCAPP ) to provide a model for a collaborative approach
	to foster technology cooperation for climate change mitigation technologies.
	Under TCAPP, the Governments of Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, Mexico, and
	the Philippines are currently working with the private sector and bilateral
	and international donor organisations to attract private investment in
	clean energy technologies in their countries. Many other donor initiatives
	have also adopted similar collaborative approaches between country officials,
	businesses, and donors in fostering private investment. However, TCAPP
	is one of the few initiatives that has engaged climate change officials
	in this collaborative process to lead to actions that address both development
	needs and climate change goals. </p>
      <p>TCAPP has two basic phases of activities. In the first phase, the participating
	countries have developed technology cooperation frameworks that define
	their climate change technology cooperation priorities and the actions
	necessary to attract private investment in these priorities. These actions
	include efforts aimed at capturing immediate investment opportunities
	(e.g., issuance of investment solicitations, investment financing, business
	matchmaking and capacity building, etc.) and longer-term efforts to remove
	market barriers. In the second phase, TCAPP assists the country teams
	in securing the private sector, in-country, and donor participation and
	support necessary to successfully implement these actions. This second
	phase of activities includes two major types of activities: </p>
      <ol>
	<li> Attracting direct private investment in immediate market opportunities.
	  This includes helping the countries develop and issue investment solicitations
	  for large-scale opportunities and business matchmaking and financing
	  activities. TCAPP has established an international business network
	  to help guide the design and implementation of these activities. </li>
	<li> Securing support for actions to address market barriers. These actions
	  range from business capacity building to policy reform. This includes
	  development of domestic implementation plans for these actions and securing
	  necessary donor support to assist with implementation of these plans.
	  TCAPP assists the countries in preparing implementation plans and donor
	  proposals and in matching country needs with donor programmes. </li>
      </ol>
