<h3>7.5.1 Information and Education Programmes </h3>
<p><i>Within Countries</i><br>
  The most pervasive barrier to increased energy efficiency and environmentally
  sound practices is simply the lack of information about the impact of our decisions
  and how they can be improved. Many families do not realise what they can do
  to end (or reduce) energy waste in their own homes. Building owners and operators
  do not know how operation and maintenance and retrofit decisions can reduce
  their energy costs. Entrepreneurs do not recognise the potential market for
  new energy-saving products and services. Because of the large number and diversity
  of the decision-makers in the buildings sector, this barrier requires special
  education and information programmes and the establishment of a permanent consulting
  infrastructure. Governments can play an influential role through Best Practices
  guides, school curricula and public education campaigns. </p>
<p>There are many audiences for these programmes. Homeowner guides provide practical,
  money-saving tips. Adult training programmes teach building engineers how to
  manage and operate the new energy systems of commercial buildings. Business
  and finance classes show how to develop bankable projects. Innovative school
  curricula combine lessons on energy sources and environmental issues with how
  to read meters and calculate utility bills.</p>
<p>At a deeper level (of involvement), these programmes encounter behavioural
  barriers, such as the limited ability of individuals to deal with life cycle
  cost minimisation due to the complexity of this concept, lack of data, and the
  low priority given to energy use, which remains a relatively small fraction
  of the total costs of owning and operating buildings in many countries. Another
  behavioural barrier is a short time horizon--consumers often demand two or three
  year paybacks (<i>i.e.</i>, high implicit discount rates) even though there
  is a societal interest in accepting longer paybacks on efficient and renewable
  energy measures. To a greater or lesser degree in all countries, poverty is
  a barrier. Impoverished consumers often are forced to buy the cheapest product
  available, even if this means higher future energy, environmental and social
  costs in the long term.</p>
<p>When confronting these barriers, does the provision of free technical information
  really influence human behaviour? A recent study by the Resources for the Future
  seeks to answer this question as it applies to a private firm by modelling the
  many factors that go into a company's decisions on whether to invest in energy-efficient
  lighting. The study found that information programmes make a significant contribution
  to the transfer of efficient lighting in commercial buildings, although these
  programmes are less important than the basic price signals (Morgenstern, 1996).</p>
<p><i>Among Countries</i><br>
  International programmes offer a relatively low cost and highly important mechanism
  for exchanging information on ESTs. For example, the Centre for the Analysis
  and Dissemination of Demonstrated Energy Technologies (CADDET) of the International
  Energy Agency (IEA) provides a large and growing computer database of more than
  1,600 energy efficiency and renewable energy demonstration projects (CADDET,
  1998). CADDET also provides valuable analyses of technology applications. Designed
  to complement national programmes, CADDET is now seeking to provide information
  to persons in developing countries.</p>
<p>Although the transfer of information from developed to developing countries
  is important, a higher priority also needs to be given to the transfer of information
  about the energy-using patterns and opportunities in developing countries to
  developed countries, and the exchange of information among developing countries
  and countries with economies in transition. </p>
