<h1>Executive Summary </h1>
<p>The residential, commercial, and institutional buildings sector accounted for
  about one-third of the global energy used in 1990 and roughly one-third of the
  associated CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions. The sector's share
  of energy consumption is higher in developed countries than in developing and
  transition countries. Energy is used to heat and cool buildings, and to provide
  lighting, as well as services ranging from cooking to computers. The emissions
  from the building sector includes those from the direct use of fossil fuels
  in buildings, and emissions from the fuels used to furnish electricity and heat
  to buildings. About two-thirds of these emissions were from residences; the
  other one-third from commercial and institutional buildings (Watson et. al.
  1996a). The achievable reductions below baseline projections are estimated at
  10-15% in 2010, 15-20% in 2020, and 20-50% in 2050, relative to the IS92 scenarios.</p>
<p>To achieve these reductions requires technology transfer programmes that work
  rapidly and effectively to diffuse the best environmentally sound technologies
  (ESTs). The buildings sector is more atomistic and decentralised than the industrial,
  energy, and transportation sectors, making it more difficult to transfer technology
  and transform markets. The most successful government-driven pathways include
  (mandatory) energy and environmental standards for new buildings and equipment;
  information, education and labelling programs; and government-supported research,
  development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D) programmes. Governments also have
  a key role in creating a market environment for successful private sector-driven
  technology transfer through decisions on financing, taxes, regulations, and
  customs and duties. Governments, particularly local governments, can encourage
  successful community programmes by proactively identifying community-level needs,
  and by encouraging and responding to community initiatives.</p>
<p>In the near term, the most successful technology transfer programmes will not
  be driven by their environmentally sound benefits alone, but because they also
  meet other human needs and desires. Examples include new energy-efficient buildings
  that are more comfortable and provide more services, yet have lower energy costs
  and lower greenhouse gase (GHG) emissions. The most successful technology programmes
  focus on new products and techniques that have multiple benefits. </p>
