<h1>Case Study 29</h1>
<p> <b>ROK-5 Mangrove Rice Variety in Sierra Leone</b><br>

<p><b>Keywords</b>: Sierra Leone, Africa, mangrove rice, improved yields, intra-national
  transfer </p>
<p><b>Summary</b><br>
  The development of a new mangrove rice variety in Africa is an important case
  study of technology development and diffusion that relates to the opportunity
  for agriculture to contribute to increased output of food while at the same
  time reducing the impact of agriculture on global climate change per unit of
  food produced. This development involved both international cooperation and
  a critical commitment of local resources to be successful and has proved itself
  to be an important contributor to increasing rice production in Sierra Leone
  with important potential contributions to similar areas in Africa.</p>
<p><b>Background</b><br>
  This project developed and extended a rice variety for mangrove rice production
  that increased yield per unit of land and per unit of inputs as well as adapting
  to changes in climate that had already occurred. The diminishing rain forest
  resulted in less rainfall and in a reduction of the fresh water available to
  mangrove rice systems. Thus, a shorter-season variety to capture available seasonal
  rainfall was a logical potential adaptation. Pest resistance was also added
  which reduced energy consumption from the use of pesticides. The incentive for
  this was a national and regional concern over adequate food production. The
  path used was the development of a new rice variety to improve yields and reduce
  the level of inputs required. Stakeholders included consumers and farmers in
  Sierra Leone, Sierra Leone agricultural researchers at Rokupr, and the West
  African Rice Research Development Association (WARDA). Critical to the choice
  of this path was the farming systems research which had been carried out years
  earlier. This identified the problem, provided an understanding of mangrove
  rice farming systems, and described the parameters under which new technology
  would be successful and successfully transferred. The barriers to technology
  transfer included a civil war, a collapsed transportation system, no capital
  for investment, and the lack of government resources to mount a large-scale
  technology transfer effort.</p>
<p><b>Approach</b><br>
  Much of the success of this effort hinged on the accident of a critical mass
  of researchers at the government rice research station in Rokupr Sierra Leone
  and the interest of WARDA in this effort. WARDA provided additional resources
  to the station at Rokupr to carry out the development of a new rice variety
  to meet the changed climate conditions and improve yields above those previously
  achieved. The development and diffusion took only years to achieve, not decades.
  There were no real commercial considerations here. It is critically important
  to recognise that in agriculture a genetic improvement such as a new variety
  usually does not require an accompanying change or increase in the capital stock
  or equipment of a farming operation. </p>
<p>There were no royalties or commercial benefits involved. The Sierra Leone agricultural
  research establishment was able to demonstrate the value of their rice research
  effort to the food supply of the nation, and WARDA was able to demonstrate to
  their financial supporters their value in contributing to this new technology
  and its transfer. There was a German seed distribution project that helped with
  some seed distribution, but farmers themselves undertook most of the technology
  transfer to other farmers once the success of the new variety became apparent.</p>
<p><b>Impacts</b><br>
  The impact was an increase in rice output from mangrove rice production where
  climate change was beginning to reduce yields from this agricultural resource.
  This lead to improved conditions for farmers and more rice available beyond
  farm-family subsistence for distribution and sale to local consumers. This case
  is replicable, but the key was the existence of local research and development
  capacity such as the Rokupr rice research station with a critical mass of competent
  staff. (Due to civil war, this institution is no longer a viable operation.)
  Its viability was also a result of the willingness of WARDA to give it the marginal
  resources to do the job that the government of Sierra Leone was unwilling or
  unable to supply. </p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  For successful technology transfer there must be locally-based and supported
  institutions with a primary stake in the technology and in its successful transfer.
  There may also be instances where an international organisation can provide
  marginal resources to get the job done. However, the transfer of the technology
  by the users themselves depended upon the ease of local adaptability to the
  technology, the confidence farmers had in their local institution and its products,
  and effective demonstration of its success. The development of technology also
  depends upon a degree of civil order and investment by the local government
  in technology development and transfer. Where there are similar crops and farming
  systems in different countries there is also a natural opportunity for several
  countries to combine and pool resources for technology development and transfer.
</p>
<p>The key lesson learned is that if there is an essential need and the technology
  is good enough agriculture technology can be transferred by farmers without
  new formal technology transfer institutions or efforts. A new effort may assist
  and speed up the transfer. However, in the case of a variety or practice that
  does not require new investment and changes in basic skills, farmers will adopt
  and pass this technology on to their neighbours rapidly. </p>
<p>The international community needs to recognise that parachuting in a new technology
  from the outside often does not work and faces especially severe problems in
  technology transfer. What is key is how international resources are spent. In
  cases like this, international resources must involve and contribute to the
  national programme to ensure appropriateness and transfer based on local ownership
  and local institutions that are already trusted in technology transfer.</p>
