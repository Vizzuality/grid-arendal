<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p><b>Background</b><br>
  Article 4.5 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
  states that developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in
  Annex II &quot;shall take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance,
  as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies
  and know-how to other Parties, particularly developing country Parties, to enable
  them to implement the provisions of the Convention.&quot; The Subsidiary Body
  for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) identified at its first session
  a list of areas in which it could draw upon the assistance of the IPCC. This
  Special Report was prepared in response to this request. It addresses the technology
  transfer problem in the context of all relevant UNFCCC provisions, including
  decisions of the Conference of Parties (COP), and Chapter 34 in Agenda 21. It
  attempts to respond to recent development in the UNFCCC debate on technology
  transfer, by providing available scientific and technical information to enable
  Parties to address issues and questions identified in Decision 4/CP.4 adopted
  by COP4.</p>
<p><b>The role of technology transfer in addressing climate change</b><br>
  Achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, as formulated in Article 2<sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(1,1); return false;">1</a></small></sup>
  , will require technological innovation and the rapid and widespread transfer
  and implementation of technologies, including know-how for mitigation of greenhouse
  gas emissions. Transfer of technology for adaptation to climate change is also
  an important element of reducing vulnerability to climate change.</p>
<p>This technological innovation must occur fast enough and continue over a period
  of time to allow greenhouse gas concentrations to stabilise and reduce vulnerability
  to climate change. Technology for mitigating and adapting to climate change
  should be environmentally sound technology (EST) and should support sustainable
  development.</p>
<p>Sustainable development on a global scale will require radical technological
  and related changes in both developed and developing countries. Economic development
  is most rapid in developing countries, but it will not be sustainable if these
  countries follow the historic greenhouse gas emission trends of developed countries.
  Development with modern knowledge offers many opportunities to avoid past unsustainable
  practices and move more rapidly towards better technologies, techniques and
  associated institutions. The literature indicates that to achieve this developing
  countries require assistance with developing human capacity (knowledge, techniques
  and management skills), developing appropriate institutions and networks, and
  with acquiring and adapting specific hardware. Technology transfer, in particular
  from developed countries to developing countries, must therefore operate on
  a broad front covering these software and hardware challenges, and ideally within
  a framework of helping to find new sustainable paths for economies as a whole.
  There is, however, no simple definition of a &quot;sustainable development agenda&quot;
  for developing countries. Sustainable development is a context driven concept
  and each society may define it differently, based on Agenda 21. Technologies
  that may be suitable in each of such contexts may differ considerably. This
  makes it important to ensure that transferred technologies meet local needs
  and priorities, thus increasing the likelihood that they will be successful,
  and that there is an appropriate enabling environment for promoting environmentally
  sound technologies (ESTs).</p>
<p>The Report analyses the special challenges of transferring ESTs to address
  climate change in the context of sustainable development. The literature provides
  ample evidence of the many problems in current processes of technology transfer
  which makes it very unlikely to meet this challenge without additional actions
  for the transfer of mitigation and adaptation technologies.</p>
<p><b>What do we mean by technology transfer?</b><br>
  The Report defines the term &quot;technology transfer&quot; as a broad set of
  processes covering the flows of know-how, experience and equipment for mitigating
  and adapting to climate change amongst different stakeholders such as governments,
  private sector entities, financial institutions, NGOs and research/education
  institutions. Therefore, the treatment of technology transfer in this Report
  is much broader than that in the UNFCCC or of any particular Article of that
  Convention. The broad and inclusive term &quot;transfer&quot; encompasses diffusion
  of technologies and technology co-operation across and within countries. It
  covers technology transfer processes between developed countries, developing
  countries and countries with economies in transition, amongst developed countries,
  amongst developing countries and amongst countries with economies in transition.
  It comprises the process of learning to understand, utilise and replicate<sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(1,2); return false;">2</a></small></sup>
  the technology, including the capacity to choose it and adapt it to local conditions
  and integrate it with indigenous technologies.</p>
<p>The Report generally makes a distinction between developed and developing countries.
  Although economies in transition are included as developed countries under the
  UNFCCC, they may have characteristics in common with both developed and developing
  countries.</p>
<p><b>Trends of technology transfer</b><br>
  It is difficult to quantify how much climate-relevant hardware is successfully
  transferred annually. When software elements such as education, training and
  other capacity building activities are included, the task of quantification
  is further complicated. Financial flows, often used as proxies, allow only a
  limited comparison of technology transfer trends over time. The 1990s have seen
  broad changes in the types and magnitudes of the international financial flows
  that drive technology transfer.</p>
<p>Official Development Assistance (ODA) experienced a downward trend in the period
  of 1993 to 1997, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of funding for projects
  with significant impact on technology flows to developing countries. However,
  in 1998 there was an increase in ODA funding. ODA is still important for those
  parts of the world and sectors where private sector flows are comparatively
  low, like agriculture, forestry, human health and coastal zone management. Moreover,
  it can support the creation of enabling conditions, which may leverage larger
  flows of private finance into ESTs in the context of overall sustainable development
  goals in the recipient countries.</p>
<p>Levels of foreign direct investment (FDI), commercial lending, and equity investment
  all increased greatly in recent years. These are the dominant means by which
  the private sector makes technology-based investments in developing countries
  and economies in transition, often in the industry, energy supply and transportation
  sectors. However, private sector investment in the form of FDI in developing
  countries has favoured East and South East Asia, and Latin America.</p>
<p>These trends are altering the relative capacities and roles of different stakeholders.
  The importance of the private sector has increased substantially. However, there
  is a definite role for governments both in providing an enabling environment
  for the technology transfer process as well as participating directly in it.
  Many NGOs support technology transfer activities.</p>
<p><b>Stakeholders, pathways, stages and barriers </b><br>
  Technology transfer results from actions taken by various stakeholders. Key
  stakeholders include developers; owners; suppliers, buyers, recipients and users
  of technology (such as private firms, state enterprises, and individual consumers);
  financiers and donors; governments; international institutions; NGOs and community
  groups. Some technology is transferred directly between government agencies
  or wholly within vertically integrated firms, but increasingly technology flows
  depend also on the co-ordination of multiple organisations such as networks
  of information service providers, business consultants and financial firms.
  Although stakeholders play different roles there is a need for partnerships
  among stakeholders to create successful transfers. Governments can facilitate
  such partnerships.</p>
<p>There is a large number of pathways through which stakeholders can interact
  to transfer technologies. They vary depending on sectors, country circumstances
  and type of technology. Pathways may be different for &quot;close to market&quot;
  technologies and for technology innovations still in the development phase.
  Common pathways include government assistance programmes, direct purchases,
  licensing, foreign direct investment, joint ventures, co-operative research
  arrangements and co-production agreements, education and training, and government
  direct investment. </p>
<p>While technology transfer processes can be complex and intertwined, certain
  stages can be identified. These may include the identification of needs, choice
  of technology, assessment of conditions of transfer, agreement and implementation.
  Evaluation and adjustment to local conditions, and replication<sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(1,2); return false;">2</a></small></sup>
  are other important stages.</p>
<p>Barriers to the transfer of ESTs may arise at each stage of the process. These
  vary according to the specific context, for example from sector to sector, and
  can manifest themselves differently in developed countries, developing countries
  and countries with economies in transition. These barriers range from lack of
  information; insufficient human capabilities; political and economic barriers
  such as lack of capital, high transaction costs, lack of full cost pricing,
  and trade and policy barriers; lack of understanding of local needs; business
  limitations, such as risk aversion in financial institutions; and institutional
  limitations such as insufficient legal protection, and inadequate environmental
  codes and standards<sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#3" onClick="showFootnote(1,3); return false;">3</a></small></sup>
  . </p>
<p>There is no pre-set answer to enhancing technology transfer. The identification,
  analysis and prioritization of barriers should be country based. It is important
  to tailor action to the specific barriers, interests and influences of different
  stakeholders in order to develop effective policy tools. </p>
