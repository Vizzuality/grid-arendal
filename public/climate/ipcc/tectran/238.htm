<h1>12.4 Technology Transfer within Countries </h1>
<p>Climate mitigation projects under the bilateral and multilateral arrangements
  in the forestry sector could in some cases involve only transfer of funds from
  donor to host countries and agencies, without any external transfer of technology.
  Thus, diffusion of technology within countries becomes important, particularly
  in countries with large mitigation potential such as China, India, Indonesia
  (Sathaye and Ravindranath, 1998), Brazil (Fearnside, 1999) and Russia. The existing
  and emerging arrangements within countries need to be strengthened and reoriented.
  The current level of technology transfer in the forestry sector, particularly
  in developing countries, is marginal due to limitations of infrastructure and
  barriers in dissemination of R&amp;D outputs. This has not led to enhanced productivity
  in either the state-managed or farmer-managed plantation forestry systems (Ravindranath
  and Hall, 1995). Forestry needs to be more productive and profitable to be attractive
  to private investors under some of the climate change mitigation programmes.
  Technology transfer within countries is very crucial in the forestry sector.
  The sources of technology or management practices for in-country technology
  transfer could be:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Forest departments;</li>
  <li> Research institutions and university laboratories;</li>
  <li> Industry; paper and pulp, timber logging, and plantation companies; </li>
  <li> Indigenous communities.</li>
</ul>
<p> The main drivers or incentives for diffusing technologies, the key stakeholders,
  the potential barriers, and measures to overcome the barriers vary with technologies
  and some examples are listed in <a href="238.htm#t123">Table 12.3</a>. <br>

  Protected Area Management, d) monitoring and verification of C flows in forestry
  projects, e) efficiency improvements, f) utilisation and management of secondary
  forests, and g) traditional forest management practices adopted by indigenous
  communities. The policies and measures required for promoting technology transfer

<p>
  In many developing countries, logging of natural forests constitutes an important
  economic activity within the forestry sector (Masera, 1995). There is significant
  transfer of &quot;hardware&quot; at the timber processing stages, usually from
  industrialised countries. Barriers for sustainable logging include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Regulations that encourage short-term profit maximisation without taking
    into consideration long-term effects;</li>
  <li> Lack of appropriate forest management systems, which cause unwanted changes
    in species composition and reduction in the inventories of commercial species;</li>
  <li> Inadequate institutions and lack of funding for forestry services;</li>
  <li> Excessive regulation of local communities without taking into account the
    needs and traditional rights of local communities that leads to clandestine
    logging,</li>
  <li> Poor training of forest owners in technical aspects, and lack of financial
    resources to invest in basic infrastructure and detailed forest inventories,
    and </li>
  <li> Higher opportunity costs of alternative uses of the land (Klooster, 1996;
    Merino, 1996; Masera et al., 1997a).</li>
</ul>
  Policies and measures include increased access to funding for investment in
  basic infrastructure, technical and administrative training of local communities,
  and internalisation of &quot;environmental services&quot; to compete with alternative
  land uses.<br>
