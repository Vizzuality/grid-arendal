  <b>Summary</b><br>
  In the Ladakh region of India, government funded photovoltaic (PV) systems are 
  used for rural electrification. The system capital costs are covered by the 
  government; homeowners must pay for maintenance costs. Systems have been installed 
  by several agencies. One, an NGO called the Social Work and Research Centre 
  (SWRC), has successfully installed long lasting systems. Two contributing factors 
  to their success are the SWRC's development of a maintenance infrastructure 
  for PV systems and Indian government standards on the design and installation 
  of PV systems.<br>
  <br>
  The SWRC's success contributes to a high demand for PV among Ladakhi villagers. 
  Local policymakers have responded by allocating money for PV. However, the focus 
  is on installing new systems, not on building a maintenance infrastructure. 
  There is a danger that despite the SWRC's positive example, a large number of 
  PV systems will be installed without provision for maintenance.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Background</b><br>
  Ladakh is an isolated high desert in northern India. The 100,000 sq. km region 
  is sparsely populated by subsistence farmers and nomadic herders (pop. 170,000).<br>
  <br>
  Approximately 85% of the population has some access to electricity. Plans are 
  in place to electrify the remaining portion in the next few years, mostly using 
  PV.<br>
  <br>
  Barriers for PV electrification include mountainous terrain, bad roads, a harsh 
  winter climate, low population density, and a lack of skilled technicians and 
  managers. To date, low rural per capita income (estimated at $US 45/yr) has 
  not proven problematic, but only because of large subsidies.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Approach</b><br>
  PV electrification is funded by the Indian Government. Funds are distributed 
  to NGOs and private contractors through state and local government agencies.<br>
  <br>
  PV systems cost about $US 450, and consist of a 35 watt solar panel, a 75 Ahr 
  deep cycle battery, a charge controller with low voltage disconnect, and 2 fluorescent 
  lamps (9-11 watt). The winter solar resource in Ladakh allows for three hours 
  of lighting per day.<br>
  <br>
  PV systems are popular among villagers and policymakers. Reasons include low 
  cost per electrified family, short installation times, and a reputation for 
  reliability. Of 200 surveyed systems, 71% were fully functional, 27% were partially 
  functional, and 2% were non-functional. However, the average age of the surveyed 
  systems was only 2.4 years; more failures are likely to occur in time.<br>
  <br>
  The short-term success of the systems is in part because government standards 
  require the use of quality components.<br>
  <br>
  <b>PV System Maintenance:</b><br>
  There are two arrangements for maintaining PV systems. The most common is a 
  one year warranty on parts and labour. After one year these systems generally 
  are not properly maintained, as family incomes are low and no businesses in 
  Ladakh service PV systems or sell the appropriate components.<br>
  <br>
  Approximately 1,000 of the systems were installed by the SWRC, a local NGO in 
  the Tilonia school network in India. The SWRC has done an excellent job of developing 
  a village level maintenance infrastructure for servicing its PV systems. The 
  programme includes an extensive hands-on training programme for village technicians. 
  Homeowners pay a monthly fee ($US 0.70, covers ~50% of the post-technician training 
  maintenance cost) in exchange for a ten year maintenance contract. Many of the 
  SWRC systems still operate with their original batteries; a few of these systems 
  are ten years old.<br>
  <br>
  Unfortunately, system owners who are not in the SWRC network do not have access 
  to their maintenance programme; this is due in part to the large distances between 
  villages.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Success of PV Leads to More Installations:</b><br>
  The demand for electricity in Ladakh and the success of the SWRC's PV electrification 
  programme have created pressure on local officials to install more systems. 
  The response was to allocate funds for 2,000 systems for 1997 to 1999.<br>
  <br>
  However, most of these installations will not follow the SWRC's methodology. 
  Instead, the focus is on installing new systems; little money or time is allocated 
  to developing a maintenance infrastructure. This approach will likely result 
  in future problems, as systems that are not maintained will fail prematurely.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Impacts </b><br>
  Approximately 5,000 PV systems are installed in Ladakh; 25% of the population 
  is receiving electricity from solar energy. However, 70% of these installations 
  have occurred in the last three years, and lack of maintenance may prove problematic.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> The long life of the SWRC installed systems contributes to the positive 
    reputation of PV, but has not lead to the development of a maintenance infrastructure 
    for the larger number of PV systems installed by other agencies.</li>
  <li> Several elements contribute to the success of SWRC installations:<br>
    - Systems are installed using quality components according to government design 
    standards.<br>
    - Systems are maintained carefully by village level technicians. Spare parts 
    are available.</li>
</ul>
<p> Lack of funding is not an issue due to subsidies. Replication of this work 
  will require access to capital.<br>
