<h3>4.4.3 How participation has developed</h3>
<p>Participation received new attention as an explicit goal in development assistance
  in the late 1980s, due to increased emphasis on the sustainability of project
  benefits, institutional development and policy reform. Participation was initially
  promoted and applied mainly by NGOs and in small scale community development
  projects, then increasingly by multilateral organisations such as the FAO, ILO
  and UNRISD, as well as some bilateral agencies (OECD, 1997). Agenda 21 contained
  an innovative section on participation and responsibility which talked of the
  need for a social partnership to build environmental and economic security.
  Most of the innovations and accomplishments relating to participatory research
  and development have emerged from 'the third sector' (private organisations
  which are neither profit making nor affiliated to political parties) (Thompson,
  1998). Whilst these organisations are themselves attempting to spread and scale
  up their successes, they themselves recognise that experience is very limited:
  as Chambers points out, <i>&quot;And, as usual with concepts which gain currency,
  rhetoric has run far, far ahead of understanding let alone practice.&quot;</i>
  (Chambers, 1997). Mainstreaming of participation into operations - <i>i.e.</i>
  dialogue, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of development
  activities- is still a major task ahead for most donors. In-country, public
  sector organisations are also taking an increasing interest in participatory
  approaches, for a variety of reasons connected with political and economic challenges
  in the public sector (Thompson, 1998). Consumer oriented companies will engage
  in a quasi consultation process through various business tools such as market
  research and focus groups. And, the involvement of business groups, trade associations
  and chambers of commerce can be a valuable way of disseminating a technology
  through a business community.</p>
