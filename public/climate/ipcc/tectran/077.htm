<h3>4.9.2 Certification</h3>
&quot;Green power&quot; marketing is another way to certify the qualities of an
energy product (see <a href="077.htm#b46">Box 4.6</a>). In the wake of liberalisation
of markets, and more cross-boundary trading of electricity, certification issues
increasingly need to be resolved at supra-national levels. Utility companies have
now got an international working group which will start a pilot project, and there
is a certification scheme included in the new draft renewables directive in the
EU. <br>

    <td> Green power schemes are now operating in many developed countries including
      Australia, USA, the Netherlands, UK and Germany. The schemes were encouraged
      by government policy to encourage renewable energy but growth prospects
      are considerable as a result of liberalisation of electricity markets whereby
      the opportunity exists for power companies to exploit consumers' environmental
      values. Operating frameworks require cooperation, though not necessarily
      formal regulation, between parties. Voluntary arrangements operating so
      far have avoided possible conflicts with international trade regulation.
      If premium prices are being paid, it is essential to establish a verification
      system, which involves an independent and credible certification procedure.
      Consumers are only prepared to pay a premium if they have confidence in
      the product. <br>
      <br>
      Serious marketing issues have arisen with most schemes. How 'green' is green'?
      There has been resistance to the use of large scale hydro plants in Canada
      and Sweden. Energy recovery from incineration has been criticised for being
      classified as a renewable technology. Furthermore, schemes may not necessarily
      result in the creation of new capacity, and may merely result in the proportion
      of 'brown' power rising for the non-premium paying consumers. Plausible
      schemes are also thought to include requirements for energy efficiency advice.
      When schemes are certified, should the overall environmental performance
      of the company be assessed at the same time? Until there is general agreement,
      consumers can be confused by competing marketing information and these issues
      could delay internationalisation of these initiatives.</td>

Even where developing countries have embarked on paths to create regulatory frameworks
which will encourage the use of environmentally sound energy technologies, corruption
can reduce their impact unless there are robust systems for control in place.
Analysis of Inspection/Maintenance programmes has revealed that corruption or
&quot;bypassing&quot; constitutes the major problem for such programmes in developing
countries, and the impact of such programmes depends to a large extent on a successful
scheme to prevent corruptive behaviour. There are ways to reduce this problem,
on-road inspections are the only way to prevent all possible fraud with frequent
controls and frequent fines (Grutter, 1996).<br>
