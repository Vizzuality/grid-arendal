<h1>Case Study 17</h1>
<p> <b>CFC (ODS) Solvent Phaseout in Mexican Electronic Industries</b><br>

  within the country with potential of a South-South (S <img src="images/both_arr.gif" width="15" height="10">

  <br>
  <b>Summary</b><br>
  This industrial sector case study exemplifies the Mexican government leadership 
  and technology cooperation by multinational companies to set in place the technology 
  know-how and information necessary to rapidly eliminate CFC solvents used in 
  the Mexican electronic manufacturing industry.<br>
  <br>
  The CFCs were phased out under the Montreal Protocol by using HFCs, which are 
  regulated under the Kyoto Protocol. HFCs have much lower GWP as compared to 
  CFCs. The lesson learned from this technology transfer may be useful for similar 
  transfer under the Climate Change Convention.<br>
  <b><br>
  Background</b><br>
  In several impressive ways the Government and industry in Mexico supported the 
  stratospheric ozone layer protection and this had motivated technology cooperation. 
  Mexican leadership attracted the support of private companies and the U.S. EPA. 
  Diplomatically, Mexico supported the Montreal Protocol by advocating its passage 
  in 1987, by being the first country to sign the Protocol and by being the first 
  country to complete ratification. With the support of environmental NGOs, the 
  Mexico aerosol industry association &quot;Instituto Mexicano del Aerosol A.C.&quot; 
  (IMAAC), organised the first voluntary sectoral phaseout of CFCs by any developing 
  country, achieving the phaseout in cosmetic and pesticide products at least 
  five years faster than the European Union. This recognition caused the industry 
  association to reconsider conventional wisdom and to propose that Mexico phaseout 
  on the same schedule as developed countries rather than taking the additional 
  ten years allowed by the Protocol. At a series of industry workshops, it was 
  identified that the major barriers to phasing out ODS solvents used in Mexican 
  electronics manufacturing were information and access to alternatives, agreement 
  of foreign business partners and customers, and technical implementation. Jorge 
  Corona had been the President of IMAAC at the time of the Mexican aerosol phaseout 
  and also was an expert member of the Montreal Protocol Solvents Technical Options 
  Committee. This joint experience gave the Mexican industry associations full 
  confidence in the technical alternatives to CFC solvents and the ability to 
  help Mexico skip CFC solvents as they expanded and modernised factories, in 
  collaboration with international government and business partners.<br>
  <b><br>
  Approach</b><br>
  The partnership strategy was to fully involve Mexican factory managers and solvent 
  cleaning experts through workshops, technology study tours, and training. Nortel 
  assigned a full-time coordinator to identify barriers and work with the Mexican 
  government and industry authorities to speed technology change.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Impacts</b><br>
  The leadership of the government of Mexico in announcing a rapid CFC phaseout 
  goal motivated multinational companies to concentrate on modernising their Mexican 
  production facilities. Within three years of starting the project, AT&amp;T 
  built their first CFC-free factory in the world, demonstrating the technical 
  superiority of aqueous cleaning; Nortel built a new factory using &quot;no clean&quot; 
  soldering that eliminated the need to clean with CFCs. The technology was later 
  duplicated throughout the world. With the help of multinational companies and 
  associations, the new ozone-safe technologies were demonstrated and Mexican 
  experts were trained to implement alternatives. The project was ultimately successful 
  when the United States required products made either with or containing ozone-depleting 
  substances to be labelled. As a result of the technology cooperation, Mexican 
  industry was poised for the change when the labelling law took effect. The workshops 
  had educated Mexican experts and helped prepare the infrastructure to accept 
  new technology.<br>
  <b><br>
  Lessons Learned</b><br>
  The initial slow progress in implementing technology at Mexican factories has 
  four explanations: 1) local companies initially lacked motivation to change, 
  2) customers of Mexican products were slow to specify environmental criteria, 
  3) funds from the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol were delayed by 
  government procedures, and 4) CFC solvent suppliers discounted prices and undercut 
  market incentives.<br>
