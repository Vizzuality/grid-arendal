<h1>5.7 Conclusions </h1>
<p> ODA is still significant for the poorest developing countries. There is increasing
  recognition that ODA can best be focused on mobilising and multiplying additional
  financial resources, assist the improvement of policy frameworks and be based
  on long-term commitments to capacity-development. However, the advantages of
  public-sector finance may be offset by assistance in the form of tied aid, which
  can be detrimental to the longer-term prospects for indigenous technology development
  by preventing the establishment of the institutions to support technology choice,
  financing, and operation and management. Tied aid is more useful at targeting
  areas such as capacity building and project preparation. <br>
  <br>
  There are several channels for international public finance. Bilateral development
  aid is the largest, with very mixed records relating to technology transfer
  and sustainable development that, furthermore, varies widely between countries.
  The MDBs are another major route, and in many cases these now have more developed
  environmental criteria and sources. Agencies such as UNDP may also strongly
  influence technology transfer through their programmes. On the other hand, trade
  support, such as export credits, rarely takes account of environmental factors
  and may in many respects be biased against environmentally sound technologies.<br>
  <br>
  The choice between different international financing routes is determined by
  many factors. One major issue regarding the effective transfer of ESTs through
  public finance is the fact that foreign aid expenditure tends to be institutionally
  divorced from other powerful agencies that also have a huge influence on technology
  choice and investment patterns, such as trade ministries. It is not uncommon
  to find governments pursuing seemingly contradictory international financial
  policies, and one of the strongest recommendations in this area is for greater
  institutional coherence within donor governments.<br>
  <br>
  An important trend is the shift away from the public sector to the private sector
  as the principal source of finance. Transfers of ESTs are influenced by this
  trend, partly because the private sector requires relatively high rates of return
  and does not monetise externalities. Although the private sector has begun to
  recognise the importance of climate change, governments can enhance private
  involvement through various types of initiatives and partnerships. Private support
  for climate-friendly technology transfer may also require financial innovations
  and emphasis on different forms of finance such as micro-credit, leasing and
  venture capital.<br>
  <br>
  There is a wide variety of types of traditional private sector debt and equity
  finance available depending on the scale and type of the project. The most flexible
  way to finance debt is secured loan and leasing. The transfer of ESTs to developing
  countries will also involve increased use of innovation to structure existing
  financial products to new markets and to develop new ones as appropriate. Just
  as support for scientific and technical innovation is seen as an appropriate
  use of public funds, so is support for financial innovation. A number of worthwhile
  initiatives have been undertaken to date (such as micro-credit, project finance,
  green finance and also the use of strategic investors), and there is scope to
  replicate and extend these as well as develop new concepts. <br>
  <br>
  Although the private-sector pathway is one of the key channels for the transfer
  of EST, it should not be assumed that the search for economic gains on the part
  of individuals and firms will guarantee adoption of best-practice techniques.
  A number of obstacles that are internal to firms can retard the diffusion of
  pollution-reducing innovations even when such innovations would be profitable.
  These obstacles are not instances of &quot;market failure&quot; in the traditional
  sense, because they originate within firms rather than arising from the strategic
  interactions between firms or from the existence of externalities or public
  goods. These barriers can also retard the transfer of environmentally beneficial
  technologies between firms. Policy measures, public-private partnerships, and
  internal organisational improvements can help overcome these barriers and promote
  the interests of all stakeholders.<br>
  <br>
  Public-private partnerships are increasingly seen as an effective way in which
  the public sector can achieve public policy objectives by working with the private
  sector. For the public sector they have the potential of harnessing the efficiency
  of the private sector, as well as overcoming budget restrictions and leveraging
  limited public funds. For the private sector, they aim to help overcome some
  of the internal and external barriers which prevent appropriate technology transfer
  from taking place, and to create interesting business opportunities. There have
  been a number of examples in this area, many of them funded by the multilateral
  development banks, and the support of the GEF has been useful in many cases
  - its flexibility and adaptability has been a major strength.<br>
  <br>
  In order to overcome information barriers, technology information centres have
  been widely advocated, but existing experience and literature does not provide
  enough certainty about exactly what is required for key stakeholders at critical
  stages. The value of other forms of technology intermediaries is better established,
  such as national-level technology transfer agencies, electric utilities, and
  energy service companies. ESCOs in particular have gained widespread acceptance
  to stimulate innovative financing schemes- they address the financial, capability,
  and other institutional market issues. An ESCO is a firm that offers energy
  services to customers with performance guarantees. Typical performance contracting
  arrangements provide customers with feasible means of improving their competitiveness
  by reducing energy consumption costs. Governments and other public-sector entities
  can develop technology intermediaries through direct support and other interventions.</p>
