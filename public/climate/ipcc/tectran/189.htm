<h3> 10.2.2 Natural gas</h3>
<p>
  The most important contribution of natural gas related to carbon emission reduction
  is the substitution of gas for coal. For example, this could be very significant
  in China where natural gas is desirable for replacing direct coal combustion
  for industry and heating in urban areas, where it causes serious air pollution
  problems.<br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, natural gas transportation is always a source of potential methane
  emission. There are large opportunities to reduce methane emissions from this
  source by promoting the more widespread use of available technologies and practices
  in the production, transmission, storage and distribution of natural gas (US
  EPA, 1993). The largest emission reductions can occur from using or reinjecting
  gas associated with oil production, rather than venting or flaring this gas.
  Flaring is preferable to venting because even an inefficient flare will convert
  the majority of the methane (usually more than 98 per cent) to a less harmful
  greenhouse gas (CO<span class="subscript">2</span>). Around 5 per cent of world
  natural gas production goes to flaring and venting (80% and 20% respectively).
  A similar amount, 6 to 7 per cent of world production, is thought to be reinjected.
  Encouraging the use of natural gas and developing the infrastructure to do so
  can help reduce emissions from oil production. Estimates are that a 50 per cent
  reduction in emissions from venting and flaring is readily achievable (US EPA,
  1993). Thus, technologies are readily available to reinject gas or to efficiently
  flare when necessary. Large oil corporations could show leadership and actively
  stimulate the use and dissemination of these technologies (see <a href="104.htm">Section
  5.4</a>). <br>
  <br>
  Other measures to reduce losses during natural gas treating and transport have
  been developed. For example, the Natural Gas Star Program at the US EPA has
  documented a variety of best practices such as (US EPA, 1997):</p>
<ul>
  <li> Use of dry seals in centrifugal compressors; </li>
  <li> Detailed inspections and maintenance at compression stations; </li>
  <li> Reduction of glycol circulation in dehydrators;</li>
  <li> Vapour recovery on crude storage; and </li>
  <li> Replacement of high bleed pneumatic devices with low or no bleed devices</li>
</ul>
<p> An important issue regarding natural gas transportation is pipeline leakage.
  This is a serious problem in the Former Soviet Union (FSU), particularly in
  Russia and the Ukraine, through which passes a significant share of European
  gas from Russia, but these leakages can be mitigated (Strategic Development
  of the Russian Gas Industry, 1998). <br>
  <br>
  Another source of greenhouse gases is the CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  that is co-produced with oil or natural gas. The CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  is usually removed by amine scrubbing. Rather than release the CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  to the atmosphere, CO<span class="subscript">2</span> can be reinjected. Excess
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, extracted from natural gas, is being injected
  into a shallow underground aquifer in the Sleipner Field in offshore Norway
  (Baklid and Korbol, 1996; US DOE, 1997). In this development, 1 TgC per year
  are being re-injected.</p>
