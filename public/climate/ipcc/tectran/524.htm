<h1>3.3 Industry </h1>
<p>The industrial sector is extremely diverse and involves a wide range of activities.
  Aggregate energy use and emissions depend on the structure of industry, and
  the energy and carbon intensity of each of the activities. The structure of
  the industry may depend on the development of the economy, as well as factors
  like resource availability and historical context. In 1995, industry accounted
  for 41% of global energy use and up to 43% of global CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  emissions. Besides CO<span class="subscript">2</span> industry also emits various
  other GHGs. Although the efficiency of industrial processes has increased greatly
  during the past decades, the potentials for energy efficiency improvement in
  all processes remain large. Fundamentally new process schemes, energy and resource
  efficiency, substitution of materials, changes in design and manufacture of
  products resulting in less material use and increased recycling, can lead to
  substantial reduction in GHG emissions. </p>
<p>Technology transfer can be most effective in OECD countries if technologies
  comparable to that of efficient industrial facilities are adopted during stock
  turnover. For countries with economies in transition, technology transfer options
  are intimately tied to the economic redevelopment choices and the form that
  industrial restructuring takes. In developing countries, large potentials for
  adoption of energy efficient technologies exist as the role of industry is expanding
  in the economy. Hence, in industry, GHG emission reduction is often the result
  of investments in modern equipment, stressing the attention to sound and environmentally
  benign investment policies. </p>
<p>Barriers for technology transfer in the industrial sector include corporate
  decision-making rules, lack of information, limited capital availability, shortage
  of trained personnel (especially in small and medium sized enterprises), low
  energy prices, and the &quot;invisibility&quot; of energy savings. Developing
  countries suffer from all barriers that inhibit technology transfer in industrialised
  countries plus a multitude of other problems. </p>
<p>Global investments in industrial technology (i.e. hardware and software) are
  dominated by the private sector, although in some countries government-owned
  enterprises are still important. Foreign capital investment in the industrial
  sector is increasing (see Figure TS2). Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a
  large part of the total foreign investments. FDI is increasing, although concentrated
  on a small number of rapidly industrialising countries (see Figure TS3). Despite
  the concentration, the development in these countries may impact regional industrial
  development patterns, as seen in Southeast Asia. Private investment is increasing
  in other developing regions but still limited. Public funding (in industrialised
  and developing countries) for technology development and transfer, although
  still important, is decreasing. Funding for science and technology development
  is important to support industrial development, especially in developing countries.
  Public funding in the industrial sector, although small and declining in comparison
  to private funding, remains important for longer term development.</p>
<p>An effective process for technology transfer requires active networks among
  users, producers and developers of technology. The variety of stakeholders makes
  it necessary to have comprehensive industrial policies for technology transfer
  and co-operation, both from a technology donor and technology recipient perspective.
  Such a framework may include environmental, energy, (international) trade, taxation
  and, patent legislation, as well as a variety of well-aimed incentives. Changing
  economic and technical developments stress the need for innovative and flexible
  approaches. Instead of regulation specifying the means, policies such as voluntary
  agreements with well-defined goals for energy efficiency improvements, can be
  more successful. There is a strong need to develop the public and private capacities
  to assess and select technologies, in particular for state owned and small and
  medium sized industries. Stakeholders (policymakers, private investors, financing
  institutions) in developing countries have even more difficult access to technology
  information, stressing the need for a clearinghouse for information on climate
  change abatement technology, well integrated in the policy framework. To be
  successful, long term support for capacity building is essential to meet the
  need for public support and co-operation of technology suppliers and users.</p>
<p>Adaptation of technology to local conditions is essential, but practices vary
  widely. Countries that spend on average more on adaptation seem to be more successful
  in technology transfer. Successful technology transfer includes the development
  of technological capabilities of the user or host. This will accelerate the
  technology transfer process through assimilation, adaptation and development
  of new technologies. </p>
