<h3>3.3.4 Convention on Biological Diversity </h3>
<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was adopted at the Rio Summit
  in 1992. It addresses one of the most pressing issues of the modern era, sustainable
  management of the living resources of the planet. It also, for the first time,
  adopts a comprehensive rather than a sectoral approach to the conservation of
  the planet's biodiversity and sustainable use of its biological resources. In
  the four sessions of the COPs, the Parties developed a mechanism for the normative
  development of the Convention and its implementation. The Convention provides
  for &quot;access to and transfer of technology&quot; in Article 16. When this
  is read with Article 19 dealing with &quot;handling of biotechnology and distribution
  of its benefits&quot;, it reflects the years of North-South debate in other
  fora over the issue of technology transfer and the issue of intellectual property
  rights (Glowka <i>et al</i>., 1994). </p>
<p>The closely interlinked provisions along with Articles 16 and 19 are Articles
  12 (research and training), 17 (exchange of information), and 18 (technical
  and scientific cooperation). Together they seek to &quot;provide and/or facilitate
  access for and transfer to other Contracting Parties&quot; of: technologies
  relevant to the conservation of biological diversity, technologies relevant
  to the sustainable use of its components or technologies that make use of genetic
  resources. </p>
<p>CBD includes provisions for biodiversity-rich developing countries to regulate
  access and, eventually, to the use of these resources. This approach is now
  being carried out in access to genetic resources and benefit-sharing agreements
  around the world (Reid <i>et al</i>., 1993). A key component of the CBD supporting
  such mechanisms was the recognition of national sovereign rights over genetic
  resources. </p>
<p>The CBD specifically addresses access to and transfer of technology relevant
  to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, including biotechnology.
  Such access and transfer to developing countries should be facilitated under
  fair and favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms
  where mutually agreed and in accordance with the financial mechanism (GEF).
  The situation calls for a careful balance between technology needs, financial
  requirements, appropriate regulatory frameworks and cooperation among countries.
  In this context - and for any other international agreement with technology
  transfer provisions - national strategies to determine technological needs play
  an important role.</p>
<p>The CBD also established that transfer should be under terms which recognise
  and are consistent with intellectual property rights over these technologies.
  Since the CBD is concerned directly with access to and use of genetic resources,
  IPRs have played a more central role than seems likely in the context of climate
  change. The debate has also been highly contentious, with some developing countries
  arguing that TRIP provisions may need to be amended or set aside in the context
  of the CBD, and a number of western governments and industry groups strongly
  contesting this position (<i>e.g</i>. UNICE, 1997). Technology transfer in the
  case of technologies related to genetic resources, particularly the biotechnology
  which is largely developed by the private sector, presents certain differences
  with respect to climate change related technology transfer. </p>
