<h1>Case Study 30</h1>
<p> <b>Use of Indigenous Technologies/Community-driven Pathways in the South Pacific</b><br>

<p><b>Summary </b><br>
  The transfer of conventional coastal protection technology followed the classical 
  international aid route where the recipient developing country applied for assistance 
  and often installed unsuitable coastal protection technologies, which eventually 
  failed. An integrated system using a combination of indigenous and conventional 
  technology has now been initiated through the efforts of the local community 
  in Tuvalu. The significant feature of this case is that the benefits of an integrated 
  approach to coastal protection were apparent to the community.</p>
<p><b>Background</b><br>
  In the past, protection of coastal assets in Tuvalu was not as high a priority 
  as it is today since many of the structures were made of naturally abundant 
  renewable materials, such as coconut leaf fibres. Traditional coastal protection 
  systems focused on dealing with the effect of coastal erosion as a result of 
  wind and wave action (Seluka, 1997). However, beach mining, land reclamation 
  and imported structures have changed the nature and value of this technology. 
  The increased intensity and frequency of tropical storms and cyclones predicted 
  as a consequence of GHG emissions may also limit the utility of these approaches. 
</p>
<p><b>Approach</b><br>
  In the early 1980s, the Public Works Department of the Tuvalu government submitted 
  a request for assistance from the European Union to install a coastal protection 
  system for eroded areas of foreshore within Fongafale, Tuvalu. Conventional 
  systems such as gabion baskets, concrete blocks and concrete walls were installed 
  along the foreshore on the lagoon side. In the case of concrete walls and blocks, 
  the aggregates had to be sourced by dredging in the lagoon, causing environmental 
  problems.</p>
<p>The gabion baskets proved the most effective of these systems but only while 
  the encasing remained intact. Nevertheless, local communities could not afford 
  this type of coastal protection system because of the costs of maintenance, 
  the limited supply of large stones, and difficulty in transporting materials 
  (Seluka, 1997).</p>
<p>The Tuvaluans have detailed knowledge of seasonal, countervailing patterns 
  in lagoon currents and tidal flows. Some of the older residents can allegedly 
  predict the dispersal and concentration of sediments across the lagoon and barrier 
  reef. Traditional responses to coastal erosion include coconut leaf walls, coconut 
  fibre stone units, wooden walls and platforms, coral stone walls, fish traps, 
  trees, relocation of housing and a combination of these methods (Seluka, 1997). 
  These methods are low cost and they are effective in reducing wave energy and 
  stabilising sediments along the foreshore. </p>
<p>In the last few years, through a combination of government assistance and community 
  effort, an integrated system using a combination of indigenous and conventional 
  technology has been initiated. The Agricultural Department assists this process 
  by advising the community on the use of particular plant and tree species with 
  multiple uses (e.g., timber for houses, canoes, and soil erosion control) (Seluka, 
  1997).</p>
<p><b>Impacts</b><br>
  The potential of traditional coastal protection systems, such as those practised 
  in Tuvalu, are as yet not known for their effectiveness in addressing problems 
  of coastal erosion. The impacts of the traditional methods are, however, expected 
  to be beneficial as they involve local people in the seawall construction and 
  design. Nevertheless, difficulties of effective design and appropriate materials 
  compared to those of the popularly perceived and most easily-acquired materials 
  (see <a href="304.htm">Section 15.5.2</a>) can likely prove to be a barrier 
  to the dissemination of this technology. Furthermore, national or government 
  level decision-making may have a limited impact on the more traditional practices. 
  These impacts are significant for integrating indigenous knowledge and experience 
  in the villages. </p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  Community has a legitimate role to play in the formulation of project proposals 
  and requests for assistance. However, community cannot be simply defined in 
  advance by outsiders, but broad local participation in planning, design and 
  decision making should be encouraged in line with various ecological, social 
  and economic linkages.</p>
<p>Responses or adaptation strategies to coastal erosion in the South Pacific 
  islands need to consider more than coastal engineering solutions. The nature 
  of the problem and the exiting socio-economic, cultural and environmental situation 
  must be understood.</p>
<p>The critical mass of research and development capacity to develop technology 
  does not exist in most Pacific island nations. The more modern coastal protection 
  technologies are constrained by agreements or high costs that governments willing 
  to pay for the associated benefits. However, neither modern nor traditional 
  technologies necessarily provide a long-term solution to coastal management 
  problems. In other words, traditional coastal protection systems may be just 
  as appropriate as the more modern systems. The integration of traditional and 
  modern systems has the potential to improve the effectiveness of coastal protection 
  systems (Seluka, 1997). This gives an opportunity for the community to focus 
  on a diverse suite of coastal protection mechanisms within an integrated planning 
  scheme. </p>
