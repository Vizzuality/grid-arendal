<h1>14.3 Current Social, Economic and Technological Influences on Population Vulnerability
  to Adverse Health Impacts</h1>
<p>Despite rapid economic growth over the past few decades, inequalities in income
  have generally increased both within and between countries, in association with
  an increasingly market-driven global economy. Between 1960 and 1993, the difference
  between average per capita incomes in industrialised and in developing countries
  tripled (UNDP, 1996). Inequalities in health have also increased because, although
  the health of most populations has improved over the past half-century, these
  gains have not been shared equally. International reviews indicate that present
  trends in population growth, consumption, and economic inequality are likely
  to lead to ecologically unsustainable patterns of development that would undermine
  the basic prerequisites for good health (UNDP, 1996, 1998; UNEP, 1999).</p>
<p>There is a large and growing population that suffers the double burden of poverty
  and disease (WHO, 1995). This population, especially in developing countries
  and countries with economies in transition (CEIT), is also increasingly having
  a double disease burden, with the highest incidence of both infectious endemic
  diseases (tuberculosis, dengue, cholera, etc.) and the degenerative diseases
  typical of urban-industrial societies. The &quot;technology&quot; exists to
  prevent or control most of the world's biggest killers, because they are linked
  to factors such as inadequate: food supply, mosquito control, safe water, secure
  shelter, access to education and healthcare (WHO, 1992). The barriers that exist
  to improved public health are to a large extent the same social and political
  barriers to the elimination of poverty. </p>
<p>Assessment of the potential for adaptation is dependent on both knowledge of
  potential impacts and on the vulnerability. Vulnerability is a function of the
  extent to which a health outcome is sensitive to climate change, and on the
  capacity of the population to adapt to new climate conditions (Parry and Carter,
  1998). Thus, technologies that strengthen adaptive capacity are technologies
  that reduce vulnerability and vice versa.</p>
