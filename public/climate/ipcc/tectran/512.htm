<h1>2.1 Building capacity</h1>
<p>Capacity building is required at all stages in the process of technology transfer.
  It is a slow and complex process to which long-term commitments must be made
  for resources and to which the host country must also be committed if results
  are to bear fruit. For enhancing the transfer of ESTs, the focus should be on
  building human, organisational and information assessment capacity. Moreover,
  integrating human skills, organisational development and information networks
  is the key to effective technology transfer. Social structures and personal
  values evolve with a society's physical infrastructure, institutions, and the
  technologies embodied within them. New technological trajectories for an economy
  therefore imply new social challenges. This requires a capacity of people and
  organisations to continuously adapt to new circumstances and to acquire new
  skills. Governments can support the establishment of dynamic flexible learning
  mechanisms not only at the national level, but also at a level of sub-national
  regions. This applies both for mitigation and adaptation technologies. Comparatively
  little consideration has been given in a systematic way to what capacity building
  is required for adaptation to climate change. </p>
<p><i>Human capacity</i><br>
  There are many failures of technology transfer that result from an absence of
  human and institutional capacity. This makes adequate human capacity essential
  at every stage of every transfer process. The transfer of many ESTs demands
  a wide range of technical, business and regulatory skills. Capacity is needed
  to assess, select, import, develop and adapt appropriate technologies. Accumulated
  technology transfer experience indicates that developing countries enterprises
  are not always able to effectively exploit the diversity of available technological
  options and services. Policies aimed at ensuring the availability of these skills
  locally can enhance private international investments through which much technology
  is diffused.</p>
<p>Many ways of developing capabilities for the assessment, agreement, and implementation
  stages of technology transfer are suggested by development experience: (a) formal
  training of employees, (b) technological gatekeeping, by keeping informed of
  technical literature, forming links with other enterprises, professional and
  trade organisations, and research institutions; (c) learning by doing-operational
  experience such as through twinning arrangements with other firms.</p>
<p>Implementing such activities involves different responsibilities for developed
  and developing countries. The donor agency understanding or concepts of capacity
  building have frequently been that they can be developed or strengthened along
  the lines of management and organisational models of the donor countries. However,
  the experiences and results of over three decades of capacity and institutional
  building in sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, suggest that these assumptions
  or concepts do not necessarily hold. Developed country governments could therefore
  pay more attention to ensure that training and capacity building programmes
  they sponsor are in full co-operation with all relevant stakeholders, including
  local governments, institutions and stakeholders, NGOs, community organisations,
  commercial organisations and consumers and take into account local conditions
  under which these may be provided.</p>
<p>Developing country governments can build local capacities to gear them for
  technology transfer. Training and human resource development have been popular
  development assistance activities. Future approaches can be more effective by
  better stressing the integration of a total package of technology transfer,
  focusing less exclusively on developing technical skills and more on creating
  improved and accessible competence in associated services, organisational know-how,
  and regulatory management. The engineering and management skills required in
  acquiring the capacity to optimise and innovate are essential. Various kinds
  of high quality training are needed to embody in personnel of the receiving
  firm the skills, knowledge and expertise applicable to particular products and
  processes. </p>
<p><i>Organisational capacity </i><br>
  The historical legacy of development efforts, i.e. the failure of top-down,
  technology focused development, has provoked a reassessment of the appropriate
  roles of the community, government and private sector in development and technology
  transfer. It is now widely recognised that involvement of community institutions
  is an essential part of successful sustainable development and is therefore
  an important factor for the successful transfer of climate change mitigation
  and adaptation technologies. The involvement of local government agencies, consumer
  groups, industry associations and NGOs can help to ensure that the ESTs being
  adopted within their particular country/region are consistent with their sustainable
  development goals.</p>
<p>Besides the involvement of such community institutions, lessons from technology
  intensive economies teach that technology increasingly flows through private
  networks of information and assessment services, management consultants, financial
  firms, lawyers and accountants, and technical specialist groups. These new insights
  make it important for governments to strengthen the networks in which these
  diverse organisations can contribute to technology transfer. Although many actions
  that facilitate the growth of such networks are already underway, initiatives
  of particular importance to EST transfer include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Expansion of opportunities to develop firms for management consulting,
    accounting, energy service, law, investment and product rating, trade, publishing
    and provision of communication, access to and transfer of information, such
    as Internet services;</li>
  <li> Encouragement of industry associations, professional associations and user/consumer
    organisations;</li>
  <li> Participatory approaches to enable private actors, public agencies, NGO's
    and grassroots organisations to engage at all levels of environmental policy-making
    and project formulation;</li>
  <li> Where appropriate, decentralisation of governmental decision-making and
    authority, in relation to technology transfer, to effectively meet community
    needs.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Information assessment and monitoring capacity</i><br>
  Information access and assessment are essential to technology transfer. However,
  focussing too narrowly on information barriers while ignoring the later stages
  of the transfer process can be counter-productive. Technology information programmes
  should be demand driven and results oriented to the degree possible. Information
  is most useful when it supports an actual technology choice, investment decision,
  etc. </p>
<p>Because of its public good characteristics, technology infrastructure required
  to generate new knowledge and information may lack direct economic value to
  one firm, and thus individual firms may lack adequate incentives to build technology
  infrastructure on their own. This points to an important role for governments
  to create the necessary information assessment and monitoring capacity. However,
  the roles of governments and private actors in technology assessment are changing.
  Private information networks are proliferating through specialised consulting
  and evaluation services and over the Internet. Increasing FDI also demonstrates
  that many ESTs can diffuse rapidly without direct government action.</p>
<p>Governments in developing countries, developed countries and countries with
  economies in transition may wish to consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Developing improved indicators and collecting data on availability, quality
    and flows of ESTs to improve monitoring of implementation;</li>
  <li> Developing technology performance benchmarks for ESTs to indicate the potential
    for technological improvements; </li>
  <li> Improving information systems and linking them to international or regional
    networks, through well-defined clearing houses (such as energy efficiency
    and renewable energy centres), information speciality firms, trade publications,
    electronic media or NGOs and community groups. In order to overcome information
    barriers, technology information centres have been widely advocated, but existing
    experience and literature does not provide enough certainty about exactly
    what is required for key stakeholders at critical stages.</li>
