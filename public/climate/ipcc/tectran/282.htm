<h3>14.4.1 Health Sector </h3>
<p>Public health infrastructure is a fundamental resource. The last decade has
  witnessed the resurgence of several major diseases that were once thought to
  have been controlled. The resurgence of tuberculosis - which is both cost-effective
  to treat and curable in virtually all cases - has been caused by persistent,
  and in some cases increasing, poverty and a lack of political will to develop
  and sustain effective control programmes (WHO, 1998).</p>
<p>The recent resurgence of malaria in areas where it had previously been eradicated
  (Azerbaijan, Tajikistan) or under control (Iraq, Turkey) are the consequences
  of deteriorating malaria prevention and vector control programmes due to conflict
  and economic crises (WHO, 1997a). In the 1950s, vector control programmes in
  Madagascar led to the eradication of the main vector in the central highland
  plateau and almost total eradication of malaria (Lepers et al., 1988). Since
  then there has been a progressive increase in malaria due to the collapse of
  the spraying programme and population movements (Fontenille et al., 1990). In
  Ethiopia, indoor spraying campaigns with DDT were shown to be effective at reducing
  malaria (Fontaine et al., 1961), but over the last 20 years there has been an
  increase in cases, partly due to a breakdown in the health service due to civil
  war and forced movement of people. Similarly, towns in the highlands of Zambia
  where malaria was once rare now experience a substantial number of cases as
  a result of the cessation of vector control activities (Fisher, 1985). It is
  now also recognised that effective control of infectious disease cannot occur
  without active community support (WHO, 1997a). In the past, most disease control
  programmes were vertically structured, lacking robust, horizontal community-based
  support, but this has proven to be non-sustainable (Gubler, 1989).</p>
<p>The economic crises of the 1980s, in addition to poor policy decisions in the
  late 1960s and 1970s, have led to cuts in both government and household expenditure
  on health in many developing countries and CEIT (Evlo and Carrin, 1992). Cost-sharing
  policies recently implemented in Africa have resulted in people delaying treatment
  and disease progression to more life threatening forms (WHO, 1997a). In several
  countries, declines in health facility use of over 30% have been recorded following
  the policy of cost sharing (Waddington et al., 1989).</p>
<p>Decision-making whether at the policy, implementation or at the health-seeking
  (individual) level depends on availability of relevant, accurate, and useful
  information (Emmanuel, 1998; Sayer, 1998). The cost of data collection and analysis
  is often beyond the resources of developing countries and CEIT. Thus, decision-making
  is often delayed and this introduces uncertainty in the choice of policy and
  interventions. In Bolivia and Zimbabwe, Nugroho et al. (1997) have observed
  that malnutrition and other health problems in underprivileged communities cannot
  be tackled effectively unless attention is paid to family income, housing, water
  supply, sanitation, food and environmental safety. Communities with so many
  needs may downgrade the importance of some diseases. Thus, the additional hazards
  of climate change have to compete with existing community needs for a local
  decision-maker. </p>
<p>Human behaviour sometimes changes dramatically following well-targeted, culturally-sensitive
  dissemination of health information, especially when a change in attitude is
  first induced (as has happened with respect to exposure to passive smoke). Some
  issues relating to climate change could form the subject of effective health
  education programmes, for example to encourage the elimination of human-made
  vector breeding sites, and promote the use of mosquito nets impregnated with
  pyrethroid compounds to reduce malaria transmission, particularly among children
  and pregnant women.</p>
<p><i>Monitoring and Surveillance</i><br>
  The most elementary form of adaptation is to launch or improve health monitoring
  and surveillance systems (McMichael et al., 1996; WHO/MRC/UNEP, 1998; Stanwell-Smith,
  1998). <a href="282.htm#t145">Table 14.5</a> summarises the mechanisms for a comprehensive monitoring scheme
  for the types of potential health impact of climate change (Haines and McMichael,
  1997). </p>

</div>
<p>In the health sector, only the basic measures of public health status (e.g.,
  infant mortality) can be measured simply and uniformly around the world because
  births and deaths are monitored in most countries. However, disease (morbidity)
  surveillance varies widely depending on the locality, the country and the disease.
  Most of the least developed countries have poorly developed surveillance systems.
  Many developing country governments lack the resources and expertise for collecting
  appropriate data for effective monitoring of the impacts of climate change.
  Data sharing and capacity strengthening for local data collection and development
  of integrated early warning systems are very important. A strong public health
  infrastructure - international, national and local - along with active local
  community involvement is necessary to achieve effective response to information
  provided by the surveillance of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Reliable, continuous monitoring of cause-specific mortality in vulnerable populations
  would be invaluable. Effective infectious disease surveillance requires good
  laboratory support. In addition, low-cost data from primary care facilities
  could be collected in sentinel populations in vulnerable zones. The use of animal
  sentinel populations (including the investigation of outbreaks of diseases in
  animals) can be used to detect early changes in patterns of human disease as
  part of a comprehensive surveillance programme. For example, sentinel caged
  chicken flocks are used to monitor encephalitis virus in the US (Tsai and Mitchell,
  1989). Animal reservoirs are also used to monitor leishmaniasis (Semiao Santos
  et al., 1996; Mancianti et al., 1994). Effective surveillance demands global
  cooperation and exchange of information, as well as the modernising of monitoring
  and surveillance systems. Such initiatives should build on current successes
  like ProMED - a network for the exchange of information on outbreaks of new
  and resurgent infectious diseases (Morse, 1995).</p>
<p>Mosquito vectors of malaria are expected to increase their altitudinal range
  as the world warms, and the incidence of malaria may increase in certain highland
  areas in the tropics and subtropics. There is some indication that increases
  may already be occurring (Loevinsohn, 1994; Epstein et al., 1998) although this
  remains contentious (Reiter, 1998). To track these possible changes, new surveillance
  measures must be initiated to monitor vector populations and disease incidence
  in many highland areas that are not well served by clinical health services
  (Le Sueur et al., 1997). There is also a need for additional data that would
  enable researchers to distinguish the effect of climate change from other environmental
  factors which affect malaria distribution, e.g., deforestation.</p>
<p><i>Control of Vector-borne and Water-borne Diseases</i><br>
  In addition to the vector control and surveillance strategies discussed above,
  populations can be protected from vector-borne diseases by immunisation campaigns
  when a suitable vaccine exists. The coverage of existing vaccination programmes
  aimed at elimination of diseases such as yellow fever should be expanded. Unfortunately,
  no vaccines yet exist for some of the diseases most sensitive to climate change,
  e.g., malaria, dengue, schistosomiasis, nor for many newly emerging infections.
  While there is no vaccine for dengue currently approved for general use, there
  are vaccines at an early stage of development. Other strategies are important
  to combat diseases like malaria. For example, periodic checks may be carried
  out on parasite sensitivity to the commonly used antimalarial drugs. The use
  of insecticide-impregnated bed nets has been successful in reducing malaria
  transmission in endemic areas. However, there have been economic barriers and
  difficulties in obtaining the appropriate bed nets because of distribution problems.
</p>
<p>The control of some epidemic diseases, such as malaria, could benefit from
  the application of new technology (e.g., geographical information systems (GIS)
  and remote sensing technologies) to forecast outbreaks using meteorological
  data (e.g., Snow et al., 1996; Le Sueur et al., 1997; GCTE, 1998). For example,
  a prediction system for malaria outbreaks in the western Kenyan highlands is
  being developed (Githeko, 1998). Initial investment in such predictive modelling
  is relatively high. Once established, however, these systems become cost-effective.</p>
<p><a href="282.htm#t146">Table 14.6</a>. highlights malaria to indicate some types of adaptive strategies,
  and the level at which they operate. For example, specific products for vector
  control, malaria vaccines, and drugs are developed, around the world, under
  the guidelines of WHO. However, the local use of the products depends upon national
  policies and demand by users.</p>

<p>Populations that are vulnerable to water-borne diseases should have access
  to technology for safe drinking water. Cryptosporidium oocysts are resistant
  to chlorine and other disinfectants (Venczel et al., 1997) and have a very low
  sedimentation rate (Medema et al., 1998). Consequently boiling may be the most
  appropriate method of disinfecting water where risks of infection exist (Willcocks
  et al., 1998). The use of submicron point-of-use filters may reduce the risk
  of waterborne cryptosporidiosis (Addiss et al., 1996). In addition, a number
  of simple and cheap techniques have been found to be effective in reducing the
  risk of infection with cholera from contaminated water. A simple filtration
  procedure involving the use of domestic sari material can reduce the number
  of Vibrios attached to plankton in raw water (Huo et al., 1996). In Bolivia,
  the use of 5% calcium hypochlorite to disinfect water, and the subsequent storage
  of the treated water in a narrow-mouthed jar produced drinking water from non-potable
  sources that met the WHO standards for microbiologic quality (Quick et al.,
  1996). These examples of low cost technologies should become widely available
  to populations that are likely to be affected by contaminated water supplies,
  for example, following flooding. </p>
