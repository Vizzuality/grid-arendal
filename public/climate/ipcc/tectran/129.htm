<h1>7.1 Introduction<sup><small><a href="fn8.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(8,1); return false;">1</a></small></sup>
</h1>
<p>Those responsible for the transfer of ESTs to residential, commercial and institutional
  buildings face two challenges. First, they must find ways to advance the best
  technologies from a great range of new technologies available to the buildings
  sector. And second, they must advance them rapidly to meet international climate
  change goals. Buildings are long lasting and community development patterns
  have even longer lives. The incremental costs of the best technologies is slight
  at time of construction, compared with the cost of replacing energy-wasteful
  buildings and equipment. The technologies themselves are varied and powerful.
  The IPCC Technical Report I found an existing technical potential to meet the
  sector's global energy needs through 2050 with no increase in energy use from
  the 1990 level (Watson et.al., 1996b).</p>
<p>Yet, the transfer of these technologies poses special problems. Buildings vary
  greatly in their size, shape, function, equipment, climate, and ownership--all
  of which affects the mix of technologies needed to improve their performance.
  In some countries, the energy used in housing is &quot;free&quot; or subsidised
  to the occupants. When they do not have to pay the full cost of the energy they
  use, they have less incentive to use it wisely. Where a large portion of the
  occupants would have great difficulty paying the full costs immediately, there
  is strong political pressure to continue the subsidies. Governments and energy
  suppliers find it simpler and more predictable to invest in increasing energy
  supplies than in reducing the energy demands of millions of building owners
  and operators. </p>
<p>The nature of the buildings sector is changing. Urbanisation is having a great
  impact on development choices, particularly in developing countries, causing
  a rapid expansion of the housing and commercial building sectors. Due to an
  unmet demand for adequate housing in many countries, this trend is expected
  to continue, especially in some developing countries. Driven by these changes,
  a growing share of the GHG emissions in many countries is coming from the buildings
  sector. The related government decisions on environmentally sound land use planning
  and energy, water, and wastewater infrastructure will have long-term effects
  on population density and ecology systems.</p>

<p>The challenge is to identify and implement technologies that meet these changes
  and also lower GHG emissions. Fortunately, the same investments can achieve
  multiple goals. Investments in energy efficient buildings also lower future
  energy costs; produce more comfortable and healthy indoor environments; create
  more productive work places; achieve other environmental improvements; and acquire
  more durable, long-term investments. Successful technology transfer strategies
  link climate change goals with measures that produce these companion benefits.
  See <a href="fig771.htm">Figure 7.1</a>.</p>
<p> For each country, the desired mix of new technologies will be different, depending
  upon its unique climate, building stock, energy sources, stage of development,
  and social, economic, and political priorities. These values will be reflected
  in its assessment of its technology transfer priorities, which is the first
  stage in the technology transfer process. Following this assessment, the next
  stages will be obtaining agreement on the technology transfer programme and
  then its implementation, evaluation and adjustment, and repetition. (See also
  <a href="fig112.htm">Figure 1.2</a>, <a href="003.htm">Chapter 1</a>.) </p>
<p>This chapter will provide a brief description of ESTs to illustrate their nature
  and potential. The current technology transfer processes are described, including
  their limitations, focusing on the barriers to change, the different pathways
  for overcoming these barriers, and the roles of the different stakeholders.
  Governments play a prominent role in the buildings sector through their programmes
  and through decisions that affect private-sector stakeholders and community
  groups. The bulk of the chapter describes experiences with different technology
  transfer programmes, both national and international, analysing what has worked,
  what has not, and the lessons to be learned. </p>
<p>The primary focus of this chapter is buildings. The boundary between the buildings
  sector and the energy supply sector is the building envelope, where electricity,
  thermal energy and other energy resources are delivered to buildings. Renewable
  systems that deliver energy directly to buildings, such as photovoltaic arrays,
  are considered part of the buildings sector. When an industrial process dominates
  a building's energy consumption, it becomes part of the industrial sector.</p>
<p>While the primary emphasis is on increased efficiency, fuel switching also
  can lead to lower GHG emissions. This is particularly important in the buildings
  sector, where the choice among fuels, including renewable sources, is wider
  than in other end-use sectors. In developing countries, the energy used in the
  residential sector includes a significant share of &quot;non-commercial&quot;
  or traditional energy sources, such as fuel wood, charcoal, and other biomass,
  particularly for cooking (Ang, 1986). The changing patterns in energy sources
  and the possible mix of future sources will influence a country's selection
  of its preferred buildings sector technologies. </p>
<p>This chapter also covers some of the subjects in the chapters on Human Settlements
  in earlier IPCC reports (Watson et.al, 1996a). Because of their influence on
  building energy use, the chapter includes brief references to land use planning
  and water use topics. Significant energy savings result from water conservation
  projects, because of the large amount of energy used to heat, treat, and pump
  water. The embedded energy and the ability to recycle the construction materials
  used in buildings also are important and provide an important link to sustainable
  systems. While most of the attention is given to GHG mitigation, this chapter
  includes some adaptation measures,<i> i.e.</i>: water management, sewage systems,
  and building codes and standards.</p>
