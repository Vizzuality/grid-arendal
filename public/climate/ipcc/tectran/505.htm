<h1>1. Background</h1>
<p>Article 4.5 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
  states that developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in
  Annex II to take &quot;all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance,
  as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies
  and know-how to other Parties, particularly developing country Parties&quot;,
  and to &quot;support the development and `enhancement of endogenous capacities
  and technologies of developing country Parties&quot;, and calls on other Parties
  and organisations to assist in facilitating the transfer of such technologies.
</p>
<p>The Subsidiary Body for Scientific Technological Advice (SBSTA) identified
  at its first session a list of areas in which it could draw upon the assistance
  of the IPCC. &quot;Development and assessment of methodological and technological
  aspects of transfer of technology&quot; was included in this list as an important
  element of the Third Assessment Report and an issue that may be appropriate
  for an interim or special report. </p>
<p>This Special Report was prepared in response to this request. It addresses 
  the &quot;technology transfer&quot; problem in the context of all relevant UNFCCC 
  provisions, including decisions of the Conference of Parties (CoP), and Chapter 
  34 in Agenda 21. It attempts to respond to recent developments in the UNFCCC 
  debate on technology transfer, by providing available scientific and technical 
  information to enable Parties to address issues and questions identified in 
  Decision 4/CP.4 adopted by COP-4 (see <a href="505.htm#bts1">Box TS 1</a>). 
  The focus of the Report is on the technology transfer process rather than on 
  the assessment of technologies, which have been addressed in earlier IPCC Technical 
  Papers and Reports.</p>

	<li> What type of process is needed to develop a consensus on practical

	  to accelerate the diffusion of clean technologies in non-Annex I Party

	<li> What measures, programmes and activities can best help to create
	  an appropriate enabling environment for private sector investment?</li>

	  Parties and other interested organisations or innovative technology

	<li> How should information be compiled and synthesised on innovative
	  technology co-operation approaches? When should recommendations on such
	  approaches be forwarded to the Conference of Parties?</li>
	<li> How and when should information on projects and programmes of technology
	  co-operation which Parties believe can serve as models for improving
	  the diffusion and implementation of clean technologies internationally
	  under the Convention be provided to the secretariat?</li>
	<li> Can specific technology transfer goals be set?</li>
	<li> Can we develop indicators and accounting systems to track progress
