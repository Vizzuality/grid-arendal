<h1>2.2 Enabling environment and extra efforts to enhance technology transfer
</h1>
<p>Successful, sustainable technology transfer requires a multi-facetted enabling
  environment. An enabling environment for technology transfer includes macroeconomic
  conditions, the involvement of social organisations, national institutions for
  technology innovation, human and institutional capacities for selecting and
  managing technologies, the underpinnings of sustainable markets for environmentally
  sound technologies, national legal institutions that reduce risk and protect
  intellectual property rights, codes and standards, research and technology development,
  and the means for addressing equity issues and respecting existing property
  rights.</p>
<p>Governments can aid in establishing an environment which promotes markets by
  considering what is the set of institutions which underlie markets and what
  are appropriate public interventions to shape those institutions. They define
  the property rights, contract enforcement mechanisms, and many of the rules
  for transactions that are necessary for markets to work well. Policies that
  build or facilitate markets can have a strong influence on the characteristics
  of those markets - for example, the relative sales share of domestic vs. foreign
  products, the segments of consumers participating in the market, the ability
  of domestic producers to participate in the market, the technologies available,
  and how regulations govern market behaviour. </p>
<p>Creating such an enabling environment is especially relevant for those ESTs
  that are already in common use and that could be diffused through commercial
  channels, but whose spread is hampered by risks such as those arising from distortive
  incentives, deficiencies in legal systems and inadequate regulation. </p>
<p>Apart from close to market technologies, many technologies that can mitigate
  emissions or contribute to adaptation to climate change still lie beyond the
  commercial frontier. Improving the enabling environment will not be sufficient
  to stimulate the transfer of such ESTs. Many ESTs are still in the early stages
  of their development and have a comparatively short track record. Market actors
  will not accept the extra risks or costs involved in utilising these ESTs. Governments
  should therefore consider extra efforts to increase the demand of these ESTs
  by stimulating their development, lowering their costs and reducing the associated
  commercial risks. Such extra efforts may include increasing the means for such
  non-market EST transfers and creating new and improving existing mechanisms
  for technology transfer.</p>
<p>These extra efforts will be discussed integrated with the actions to improve
  an enabling environment in the following sections. In order to improve the enabling
  environment of the transfer of ESTs, both market and non-market transfers, governments
  could consider a number of actions. These actions have been classified according
  to actions for all governments, actions specific to governments of developed
  countries and actions which are in general more relevant for governments of
  developing countries.</p>
