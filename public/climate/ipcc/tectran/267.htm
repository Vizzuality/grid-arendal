<h1>13.6 Lessons Learned </h1>
<p>The waste management sector is an important one because of its contribution
  to global warming, and because it provides attractive opportunities to deploy
  mitigation technologies. Numerous alternative waste management strategies are
  available, many of which offer significant climate benefits. Available technologies
  can be adapted to a variety of local conditions to recover methane already generated
  and use it for energy or to avoid methane generation through recycling, composting,
  incineration, or aerobic waste decomposition processes. Moreover, the opportunities
  to reduce emissions are global. Although the waste management sector has different
  characteristics in developed, developing countries and CEITs, all regions have
  the potential to deploy mitigation technologies. </p>
<p>Many actors have important roles in encouraging the deployment of these technologies.
  Traditionally, large public agencies and public sector investment have dominated
  the sector. This situation is changing rapidly, however, and national governments
  need to find new roles as facilitators of municipal, private sector and community-based
  initiatives. In this changing environment, key roles for the national government
  will be in establishing workable policy and regulatory frameworks, strengthening
  financial management to facilitate private investment, providing technical assistance
  to improve technical and managerial effectiveness, and (where appropriate) providing
  incentives to encourage specific actions or technologies. In accomplishing these
  activities, national governments should seek opportunities to involve and partner
  with municipal and local government agencies, the private sector, and community
  organisations. Where national governments lack the resources of capacity to
  undertake these activities independently, they should seek foreign assistance.</p>
<p>Like government, the role of the private sector is also changing. Opportunities
  to participate in waste management projects are growing, and an increasing emphasis
  on deploying mitigation technologies will provide further opportunities. The
  role of the private sector will vary between regions, based on factors such
  as investment conditions and the readiness of various waste management systems
  for private sector investment. In the near-term, traditional types of private
  sector participation will likely expand most rapidly in developed countries.
  Developing countries and CEITs have the opportunity to encourage more innovative,
  untraditional private sector activities because of the myriad of small, informal
  private sector actors involved in waste management in these areas. These countries
  may need bilateral or multilateral assistance to assess the best ways of engaging
  this informal private sector, creating optimal frameworks for investment and
  developing strong, local private companies. The key challenge in these countries
  is to fully assess the range of alternative waste management approaches and
  project structures, instead of automatically pursuing the conventional integrated
  waste management systems of developed countries.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most significant developments in the waste management sector
  has been the recognition of the key role of community organisations. The importance
  of obtaining community input from the beginning, of identifying and evaluating
  community priorities, and of designing innovative systems that provide an appropriate
  level of service at reasonable cost has been well documented. Projects of all
  types should include community participation, regardless of whether they are
  undertaken by government agencies or the private sector. Community organisations
  are increasingly initiating their own projects, moreover, and seeking out private
  or government partners. This new role emphasises the importance of making climate
  protection a community activity, and also bodes well for the deployment of mitigation
  technologies. Not only are extensive networks of communities organising around
  climate protection and sustainable development issues, but many of the waste
  management alternatives pursued by communities (such as composting, recycling
  and methane recovery) are environmentally beneficial.</p>
<p>Technology transfer in the waste management sector has a long history, and
  has been extremely important in improving quality of life by providing waste
  management services to an increasing share of the world's population. The challenge
  is far from over, however, and expanded investments will be necessary just to
  keep pace with population and economic growth and urbanisation. Fortunately,
  a future in which the world's waste management needs are met with increased
  use of mitigation technologies is achievable. Meeting this goal requires the
  willingness of government agencies, private companies, and local organisations
  to expand their partnerships, consider the climate implications of waste management
  choices, and learn from the innovative project structures and alternative waste
  management approaches already being demonstrated around the world.</p>
