<h3>11.4.1 Adoption Barriers/Constraints </h3>
<p><i>Generic farm-level adoption constraints. </i><br>
  For farm-level adoption, the barriers include small farm size, credit constraints,
  risk aversion, lack of access to information, lack of human capital, inappropriate
  transportation infrastructure, inadequate incentives associated with tenurial
  arrangements, and unreliable supplies of complementary inputs. Because strategies
  for new technologies are often imposed from the top down, implementation fails
  when local people are not consulted or are treated as labourers only, or when
  local research and extension staff are not sufficiently trained in the specific
  techniques. Consequently, positive measures to improve soil and water productivity,
  for example, both through individual and communal action, should receive higher
  priority for research, extension, and training in the future. Some agricultural
  measures should also form part of an integrated biotechnical approach that provides
  appropriate expertise and equipment, seeds of improved cultivars, plant nutrients,
  and pest management, with strong social and economic incentives.</p>
<p><i>Environmental externalities and technology adoption. </i><br>
  As in the discussion of biotechnology transfer above, cooperation can also be
  on a commercial basis. Private firms are springing up to do biotechnology for
  a fee. One commercial organisation, for example, might do molecular marker work
  on contract. The firm identifies marker linkages with specified traits, or assists
  in backcrossing marker-linked traits into desired genetic backgrounds. Because
  of environmental externalities, market prices may not reflect the true social
  costs and benefits of particular technology adoption choices. Governments can
  play a role in improving environmental quality, not only by internalising externalities,
  but also by correcting market failures in the provision of information. Improved
  production techniques and management practices can improve efficiency and cut
  both waste and pollution, in effect replacing other, more polluting inputs with
  clean input information. However, information has certain aspects of a public
  good, and it is difficult for individual suppliers to restrict its use to only
  those who have paid for it. Consequently, private markets may undersupply information
  about environmentally beneficial technologies. Insufficient information can
  also constrain the adoption of new technologies by farmers. In such cases, the
  government may be able to improve efficiency by collecting and providing information
  about resource-conserving practices. </p>
