<h3>15.6.3 The Role of Stakeholders </h3>
<p>Currently, the international flow of coastal-adaptation technologies is mostly
  government-driven. As in any technology transfer, governments create and sustain
  the conditions for the successful development and delivery of coastal-adaptation
  technologies. As the primary technology source, they must support continuous
  and targeted innovation by means of investments in education, R&amp;D and scholarly
  and technical exchange programmes. Governments can take a proactive role in
  technology transfer by encouraging collaborative relations of national laboratories
  and universities with foreign-affiliated businesses, as well as the involvement
  of foreign nationals in publicly supported research. Claims that these policies
  result in the loss of knowledge assets paid for with public funds without fair
  compensation are mostly unfounded. Instead, the driving force of coastal technology
  transfer is often information sharing and, in an economic context, both parties
  benefit only when new knowledge, rather than currency or goods, is exchanged
  equally (Rollwagon, 1990).</p>
<p>For their part, universities must continue to invest and reward the conduct
  of basic research, since this is the &quot;seed corn&quot; for innovation. However,
  under the paradigm of international technology transfer they also have a responsibility
  to present new knowledge in forms that can be readily utilised by diverse audiences
  and to provide technical assistance. Since these activities do not generally
  lead to peer-reviewed publications, universities may wish to restructure reward
  systems to meet this new global social contract. Moreover, interdisciplinary
  approaches to understand systems rather than processes may benefit coastal adaptation
  and related technology transfer.</p>
<p>Although the companies that make up the coastal-technology sector generally
  have limited resources, many of the service providers in this sector can adopt
  practices that call for active participation and training of host-country users
  and joint project management. This leads to long-term relationships and potentially
  new business opportunities.</p>
<p>NGOs play a vital part in international technology transfer. They often serve
  as &quot;knowledge translators&quot; to bridge the gap between technology acceptance
  and application, and create and promote adaptive capabilities within the receiving
  country to sustain technology operation and maintenance, as well as enable repetition
  (<a href="311.htm#b154">Box 15.4</a>; see also <a href="056.htm">Section 4.4</a> on the role of NGOs in
  technology transfer).</p>

    <td> Non-governmental organisations can be used to promote new coastal-adaptation
      technologies, because they typically have close links to communities and
      individuals with a direct interest in the coast. NGO activities in the coastal
      zone are very diverse and range from environmental education, consultation,
      lobbying and campaigning to research into alternative coastal-management
      strategies (De Waal, 1994).<br>
      <br>
      Much of the coastal-adaptation technology transfer can be developed at the
      grassroots level, based on the needs as identified by communities and individuals.
      The advantage of NGOs is their ability to reach into isolated communities,
      which often have little or no experience in communicating problems and concerns
      to government representatives, to manage the important community-development
      components of technology transfer. NGOs may have their headquarters in metropolitan
      countries as well as country field offices to facilitate grassroots networks.
      These country field offices can facilitate country-specific bilateral and
      non-government funding and technical assistance. On the other hand, regional
      programmes also allow for cost-effective provision of technical assistance,
      training and management of project funds.<br>
      <br>
      The commonality of NGOs can be seen in terms of their wishing to retain
      maximum involvement of individuals in projects even when those projects
      involve institutional development for government. This approach is ideal
      for testing and introducing a range of adaptation technologies, especially
      simple ones, on a cost-effective basis. Cross-training and sharing of experiences,
      successes and lessons learnt between projects are essential features of
      the way NGOs operate. Quality control may also be enhanced for project monitoring
      and implementation by sharing tools and expertise. The success of this approach
      can be attributed to, amongst other things, the integration of individual
      needs with government programmes and cultural sensitivity.<br>
      <br>
      More visible and controversial technology-transfer initiatives could engage
      NGOs (UNEP, 1996), but only where there is a high degree of mutual trust
      and two-way learning, not merely the transfer of money (Earle, 1997). Experience
      and case studies (cf. De Waal, 1994) show that of the various reactionary
      strategies available to NGOs, extensive public awareness and education campaigns,
      dialogue with all interest groups and extensive media attention are amongst
      the most effective.<br>
      <br>
      NGOs may or may not have core-funding or an endowment source of funds to
      finance their operations. However, NGOs are often in a unique position to
      harness foreign funds for assistance and in administering development projects.
      Some NGO projects are implemented independently, other ones in cooperation
      with other NGOs, national institutions, government or grassroots organisations.<br>
      <br>
      The UK-based NGO Oxfam provides a good example of technology transfer relying
      on generating synergies. Oxfam supports grassroots communities in coastal-management
      activities such as replanting mangroves and developing artificial reefs,
      while concurrently assisting national fishery organisations that provide
      support to those communities. Links are encouraged between the two organisations
      and more specialised lobbying organisations in order to change national
      legislation (Earle, 1997).</td>
