<h1>2. Increase the flow, improve the quality</h1>
<p> The challenge of successfully transferring ESTs should be seen in the context
  of sustainable development. Sustainable development needs not restrict growth
  but can stimulate the emergence of a vibrant. industrial economy, a process
  in which technology transfer is likely to play a major role. Sustainable industrialisation
  is especially a challenge for developing countries, because their low initial
  level of development provides them with an opportunity to follow a technological
  trajectory which can be cleaner and more efficient than the path OECD countries
  have followed. </p>
<p>To enhance the sustainability of the development process, government actions
  can transform the conditions under which technology transfer takes place. The
  spread of proven ESTs that would diffuse through commercial transactions may
  be limited because of the barriers listed above. Governments can play important
  roles in facilitating the private transfer of ESTs by encouraging private sector
  trade and investment of environmentally sound technologies. Capacity building
  programmes and enabling environments that reduce the risks and restrictions
  associated with the transfer of ESTs will increase the flow of technologies
  close to the commercial margin. The key issue is thus to make the markets work
  by &quot; opening the channels&quot;. For technologies that will not yet diffuse
  commercially, it is important to go further than improving market performance
  by enacting policies that lower costs and stimulate demand in order to realise
  social and environmental benefits not adequately produced by private conduct.
  The international community could assist these extra efforts of individual countries
  by increasing available means for non-market transfers and creating new or improving
  existing mechanisms for technology transfer.</p>
<p>The Report clearly points out that there is no pre-set answer to enhancing
  technology transfer. It is important to tailor action to the specific barriers,
  interests and influences of different stakeholders in order to develop effective
  policy tools. As has been stated clearly in Agenda 21. policy tools are most
  effective if they are considered in the context of sustainable development.
  Agenda 21 provided some of the earliest recommendations for public policies
  to promote technology transfer for environmental benefits. These recommendations
  reflect not only the need for hardware, but also for building associated local
  capacities and for providing market intermediation. Strategies outlined in Agenda
  21 include: (a) information networks and clearinghouses that disseminate information
  and provide advice and training; (b) government policies creating favourable
  conditions for both public-sector and private-sector transfers; (c) institutional
  support and training for assessing, developing, and managing new technologies;
  (d) collaborative networks of technology research and demonstration centres;
  (e) international programmes for co-operation and assistance in R&amp;D and
  capacity building; (f) technology-assessment capabilities among international
  organisations; and (g) long-term collaborative arrangements between private
  businesses for foreign direct investment and joint ventures. </p>
<p>The three major dimensions of making technology transfer more effective are
  capacity building, an enabling environment and mechanisms for technology transfer,
  all of which are discussed in more detail in the subsections below.</p>
