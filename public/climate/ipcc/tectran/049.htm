<h1>3.7 Conclusions </h1>
<p>
  This chapter has surveyed the role of international agreements and legal structures
  in facilitating technology transfer. Facilitating technology transfer is an
  intrinsic part of the evolving climate regime under the UNFCCC. So far steps
  towards this have proceeded slowly. <br>
  <br>
  Government-driven technology and transfer pathways remain important, particularly
  in some regions. On the whole, however, the bulk of foreign investment is now
  through the private sector. Some relevant technologies (by no means all) are
  protected through intellectual property rights, particularly patents. The TRIP
  agreement embodies a considerable strengthening of IPRs in many developing countries.
  This may help to attract greater foreign investment (though IPRs do not appear
  to be a dominant consideration in most foreign investment decisions), and stimulate
  innovation. On the other hand, it may also impede the horizontal dissemination
  of technologies in some cases. More attention could be paid to the possibilities
  surrounding licensing (sometimes compulsory, where the TRIP procedures are followed
  and adequate justification is given). Where market-driven solutions are not
  feasible to address short-term access issues, international financial assistance
  should be considered. There may also be important roles for sector-based initiatives,
  standards and agreements. <br>
  <br>
  The combined set of positive measures established under the Montreal Protocol,
  such as the participatory approach, where the relevant stakeholders are involved
  in the decision-making process for setting up national strategies, the globally
  agreed and binding targets to phase out ODS, industry-government partnerships
  and NGO involvement, plus direct investment projects, have helped in facilitating
  technology transfer of ozone friendly technologies, and also contributed towards
  endogenous capacity-building necessary for improving the regulatory structure
  in developing countries. A major obstacle for several of these countries is
  the inadequacy of the regulatory structure to support the phaseout process.
  The weak capacity of governments to institute and/or enforce laws, regulations,
  and policies is a common problem for them.<br>
  <br>
  The Kyoto Protocol and the CoP4 decisions, including its establishment of the
  project-level crediting mechanisms, reflects significant changes and opens up
  important opportunities. Development of procedures relating to compliance could
  both highlight the performance of Annex II Parties with respect to technology
  transfer, and contribute to capacity-building in developing countries in ways
  that would also facilitate such transfer. In this context it is important to
  spell out the elements that constitute compliance with Article 4.5. These include
  agreeing on procedures to determine whether there is technology transfer, the
  expected roles of governments and the private sector, and finally on how to
  measure compliance with Article 4.5 of UNFCCC.<br>
  <br>
  Ultimately, in all these respects, it is on-the-ground activities that do much
  to determine effective technology transfer, and the international process needs
  most to support the capacities and activities of states in creating stable and
  supportive environments for such activities. The recent Technical Paper prepared
  by the UNFCCC Secretariat (1998d) points out the need for:</p>
<ul>
  <li> stable macroeconomic and environmental policies to provide framework conditions
    conducive to investment by the private sector;</li>
  <li> transparent and fair laws and public administration;</li>
  <li> open trade and investment policies;</li>
  <li> adequate infrastructure and human resources;</li>
  <li> opportunities to use national legislation to provide incentives for EST;</li>
  <li> educating and training people in the country to select, maintain and develop
    EST. </li>
</ul>
<p>All these factors are relevant in creating the local conditions not only for
  compliance with commitments on reporting, finance, etc., but also for fostering
  adequate implementation of provisions on technology transfer, and for creating
  conducive national conditions in host countries. These conditions form the subject
  of the next two chapters. </p>
