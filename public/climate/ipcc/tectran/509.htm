<h1>1.4 Trends in technology transfer</h1>
<p>Little is known about how much climate-relevant hardware is successfully &quot;transferred&quot;
  annually. When software elements such as education, training and other capacity
  building activities are included, the task of quantification is further complicated.
  Financial flows, often used as proxies, allow only a limited comparison of technology
  transfer trends over time. </p>
<p>The 1990s have seen broad changes in the types and magnitudes of the international
  financial flows that drive technology transfer, at least that occurringetween
  countries (see <a href="figts1.htm">Figure TS 1</a>). Official Development Assistance
  (ODA) experienced a downward trend in the period of 1993 to 1997, both in absolute
  terms and as a percentage of funding for projects with a significant impact
  on technology flows to developing countries. However, in 1998 there was an increase
  in ODA funding. ODA has become relatively less important to many developing
  countries given the dramatic increase in opportunities for obtaining private
  sector financing for technology acquisition.</p>
<p>Sources and amounts of development finance, some portion of which goes for
  technology transfer, vary widely from region to region. Countries in Sub-Saharan
  Africa received in 1997 an average of some US$27 per capita of foreign aid and
  US$3 per capita of foreign direct investment. By contrast, countries in Latin
  America and the Caribbean received US$13 per capita of aid and US$62 per capita
  of foreign direct investment. Recent initiatives to spur development progress
  in Africa aim to respond to these disparities.</p>
<p>Levels of foreign direct investment (FDI), commercial lending, and equity investment
  all increased dramatically during the 1990s. As a result, by 1997 private flows
  supplied more than three fourths of the total net resource flows from OECD member
  countries to developing countries compared to one third in 1990. Probable causes
  for this shift, and what it means for governments and the private sector, are
  described in detail in the Report. FDI, loans, and equity are the dominant means
  by which the private sector makes technology-based investments in developing
  countries and economies in transition, often in the industry, energy supply
  and transportation sectors. Private sector investment in the form of FDI in
  developing countries has favoured East and South East Asia, and Latin America.

<p>Total private flows to developing countries peaked in the first half of 1997
  and then fell significantly in the wake of the global financial crisis that
  started in Asia during the middle of that year. Most of the decline was due
  to reduced bank lending by the private sector, although this remained robust
  to Latin America. Foreign direct investment in developing countries is estimated
  to have increased slightly during 1998 and 1999. </p>
<p>Overall, FDI still represents a relatively small share of total investment 
  in developing countries, both in absolute values and as a share of all developing-country 
  inflows. FDI exceeded 10 percent of gross fixed capital formation in only eight 
  countries, and in most it is much less than seven percent of the total. Despite 
  the small size of inflows, FDI is still important for many of these economies. 
  Foreign direct investors are often manufacturers that occupy a dominant position 
  in the supply chain and that play a major part in the industrial sectors in 
  which they operate. In the best circumstances they bring to the host country, 
  and the firms with whom they work, state-of-the-art technologies and high standards 
  for environment, health and safety, and quality assurance. International financial 
  statistics, however, indicate only the quantity, and not the quality, of FDI. 
  <a href="509.htm#tts2">Table TS 2</a> shows the increase in net private capital 
  flows (of which FDI is a component) to low and middle income countries by country 
  group and region during the period 1990-1996. Notable is the low share received 
  by countries in Africa.</p>

<p>Grants by NGOs to developing countries have stayed fairly constant during the
  last decade, ranging between US$5 billion and US$6 billion per year since 1990.
  Despite their relatively modest amounts, many of these are directed at least
  developed countries and at capacity building efforts.</p>
<p>The general increase in the importance of private sector investment in developing 
  countries does not reduce the role of ODA. First and as noted above, private 
  sector investment has been very selective (see <a href="509.htm#tts2">Table 
  TS 2</a>). While almost all countries have benefited to some degree, a handful 
  of countries (East Asia and Latin America) have received most of the attention. 
  ODA is still critical for the poorest countries, particularly when it is aimed 
  at developing basic capacities to acquire, adapt, and use foreign technologies. 
  Second, ODA is still important for those sectors where private sector flows 
  are comparatively low, like agriculture, forestry, human health and coastal 
  zone management. Moreover it can be essential for certain activities including 
  the leveraging of funds for capacity building activities and supporting the 
  creation of enabling conditions which may leverage larger flows of private sector 
  finance into ESTs. Third, private investment, most notably foreign portfolio 
  equity investment and commercial lending, is volatile. Many developing countries 
  have found to their distress that private investment can quickly dry up if investors 
  perceive more attractive--or less risky--opportunities elsewhere.</p>
<p><i>Measuring Technology Transfer of EST</i><br>
  Because of the limited comparison of trends in technology transfer on the basis
  of financial flows, better indicators and data to quantify the level and flows
  of climate-relevant EST are needed to give governments better information on
  which to base their policy. In addition, technology performance benchmarks for
  different sectors could be compiled to give an indication about the real degree
  of implementation of EST and the potential for technological improvements. It
  would be useful to have simple and agreed upon criteria for measuring the transfer
  of ESTs. </p>
