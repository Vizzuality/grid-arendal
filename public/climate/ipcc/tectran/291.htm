<h1>Executive Summary </h1>
<p>This chapter assesses the current state of knowledge on technology transfer
  for coastal adaptation to climate change. It aims to inform coastal managers,
  planners, scientists and other interested actors of the process of technology
  transfer in coastal zones and of its importance when seeking to reduce coastal
  vulnerability to climate change. It identifies barriers to technology transfer
  as well as enabling policies, programmes and measures to overcome these barriers.</p>
<p>The five key messages of this chapter are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Adaptation to climate change in coastal zones is becoming increasingly
    important and many proven technologies are available for coastal adaptation.
    </b>Existing coastal technologies that have been used to deal with climate
    variability in coastal zones can also be applied to adapt to climate change.
    A range of opportunities exists for the application of both hard and soft
    technologies to complement economic, legal and institutional options. Available
    and effective technologies include traditional, indigenous, non-western technologies.
    They also include technologies to develop and exchange knowledge and information.
    Given that many technologies are available, extra efforts in technology transfer
    should focus on promoting and adjusting existing technologies, rather than
    on the development of new technologies.</li>
  <li> <b>Effective adaptation to climate change needs to consider the numerous
    non-climate stresses in coastal zones and be consistent with existing policy
    criteria and development objectives.</b> Adaptation in coastal zones must
    strike a balance between current pressures resulting from climate variability
    and unsustainable development, and anticipated impacts of climate change and
    associated sea-level rise. Adaptation technologies are best implemented as
    part of a broader, integrated coastal-management framework that recognises
    immediate and longer-term sectoral needs. Win-win situations could be established
    when coastal-adaptation technologies also provide benefits unrelated to climate
    change.</li>
  <li> <b>Successful coastal adaptation depends on many local factors and cannot
    be simply transferred to other vulnerable areas.</b> The purpose of technology
    application in coastal zones is to reduce risks and to increase adaptive capacity.
    The effectiveness of a particular technology depends on local circumstances,
    including the biophysical setting and economic, institutional, legal and socio-cultural
    conditions. Protection is not a feasible option for all coastlines. In many,
    particularly lesser developed places, retreat and accommodate strategies will
    be most effective. Local expertise is essential to identify and design appropriate
    coastal-adaptation technologies, as well as to implement, operate and maintain
    these.</li>
  <li><b> Pathways of technology transfer in coastal zones are predominantly driven
    by government interests.</b> The strongest and most direct incentives to adapt
    to climate change in coastal zones are with the public sector, although particularly
    tourism and marine transportation represent important private-sector interests.
    The private sector is typically not the stakeholder that drives technology
    transfer for coastal adaptation, because benefits are small or uncertain,
    and action is expected from the government to protect private-sector interests.
    In developing countries, the private sector is generally a less significant
    economic force, so again governments are expected to lead the way in coastal
    adaptation. In government-initiated coastal technology transfer, the private
    sector is often involved in the planning, design and implementation of adaptation
    technologies.</li>
  <li><b> Technology transfer in coastal zones faces a number of important barriers.</b>
    A refocus of institutions and funding priorities may be required to overcome
    these barriers. Many barriers to effective technology transfer are site-specific
    and require site-specific solutions. Four major general barriers exist: (i)
    lack of data, information and knowledge to identify adaptation needs and appropriate
    technologies, (ii) lack of local capacity and consequent dependence of customers
    on suppliers of technology for operation, maintenance and duplication, (iii)
    disconnected organisational and institutional relationships between relevant
    actors and (iv) access to financial means. Overcoming these barriers does
    not require setting up new institutions. Instead, existing activities and
    institutions need to be refocused to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
    of coastal technology transfer. Additionally, regional collaboration and a
    redirection of funds to support appropriate coastal adaptation to climate
    change are required.</li>
