<h1>3.8 Human Health </h1>
<p>There are opportunities for technology transfer in relation to the potential
  health impacts at several levels. Minimisation of the health impacts of impending,
  or unavoided future, climate change can entail:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Reduction of the exposure of local populations to climate change and its
    environmental and social consequences;</li>
  <li> Reduction of the vulnerability of local populations to those exposures;</li>
  <li> Improved care and treatment for those whose health is adversely affected.</li>
</ul>
<p>With respect to the first of those three modalities, the health of communities
  and populations depends fundamentally upon social and natural environmental
  conditions. Therefore governments should be fully aware of the potential public
  health impacts when assessing options for adaptation to climate change. </p>
<p>With respect to the second modality, population vulnerability can be reduced
  generically by improving the social and technical circumstances and by reducing
  socio-economic inequalities. Vulnerability can be reduced more specifically
  by adaptations directed at specific exposures, or susceptibility to them. For
  example, improved housing design and domestic temperature regulation can reduce
  vulnerability to thermal stress, while vaccinations and control of &quot;vector&quot;
  insects reduce the risks of various infectious diseases. The health gains from
  these specific adaptations will largely be confined to the population taking
  action. </p>
<p>With respect to the third issue, national public health infrastructure is of
  fundamental importance. The poorest countries, where impacts are likely to be
  greatest, are also least able to maintain a public health infrastructure. This
  area should therefore be a priority for technology transfer.</p>
<p><b>Monitoring and Surveillance</b><br>
  The most elementary form of adaptation is good health monitoring and surveillance
  systems. Within the health sector, only basic measures of population health
  status (e.g., life expectancy) can be measured simply and uniformly around the
  world. However, disease (morbidity) surveillance varies widely depending on
  the locality, the country and the disease. Many less developed countries have
  inadequate surveillance systems. Weather and climate forecasts should be used,
  where appropriate, in preventing deaths and injuries, and in disease prevention
  and control.</p>
<p><b>Control of infectious disease</b><br>
  The last decade has seen the resurgence of several major infectious diseases
  which were previously controlled, such as malaria. International efforts to
  control malaria - a known climate-sensitive disease - are failing because of
  drug resistance and the socio-economic, geographical and ecological conditions
  in much of today's world. The recent resurgence of malaria in areas where it
  had previously been eradicated (Azerbaijan, Tajikistan) or under control (Iraq,
  Turkey) reflects declines in malaria prevention and mosquito control programmes
  due to conflict and economic crises. In Ethiopia, indoor spraying campaigns
  with DDT were effective at reducing both malaria morbidity and mortality, but
  over the last 20 years there has been a programmatic breakdown because of civil
  war and the forced movement of people. WHO has recently launched a new initiative,
  the &quot;Roll Back Malaria&quot; programme, to be implemented in close co-operation
  with the World Bank and other international agencies.</p>
<p>The coverage of existing vaccination programmes aimed at elimination of diseases
  such as yellow fever should be expanded. Other strategies are important to combat
  diseases like malaria. For example, periodic checks should be carried out on
  parasite sensitivity to the commonly used antimalarial drugs. The use of insecticide-impregnated
  bed nets has been successful in reducing malaria transmission in endemic areas.</p>
<p>The incidence of certain water-borne and vector-borne infections can be reduced
  by several environmental measures. A broader approach to preventing water- and
  food-borne diseases would consider the interactions between climate, vegetation,
  agricultural practices and human activity. Strategies to control climate-sensitive
  disease require intersectoral collaboration between the health, forestry, environment,
  and conservation sectors.</p>
<p><b>Improve coverage of health system</b><br>
  There are many existing health inequalities between rich and poor; these inequalities
  are widest in developing country cities. Strategies to reduce poverty and improve
  access to health services in urban environments will serve to reduce vulnerability
  to climate change</p>
<p><b>Role of the UN system</b><br>
  Public policies to reduce socio-economic and environmental vulnerability will
  enhance population capacity to adapt to climate change. Conventional health
  sectors are not equipped nor empowered for this multidimensional task. International
  co-operation is required, for data collection, analysis, and policy-making to
  reduce health impacts.</p>
<p>The specialised agencies of the United Nations are primarily mandated to support
  government planning and management in Member States, by strengthening sectors
  such as industry, health and agriculture. Implementation of the following three-tier
  strategy endorsed by the Interagency Committee for the Climate Agenda (IACCA)
  is entrusted to WHO: </p>
<ul>
  <li> assistance to Member States to promote vulnerability assessment, adaptation
    strategies, and the adoption of technologies to promote health and reduce
    GHG emissions; </li>
  <li> the exchange and provision of information on the health impacts of climate
    change and of mitigation strategies, as well as effective approaches to adaptation;</li>
  <li> the promotion of research on the above topics.</li>
</ul>
