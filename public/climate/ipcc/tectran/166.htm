<h1>8.6 Lessons Learned </h1>
<p>The past experiences on the transfer of transport technologies provide some
  useful lessons, which could help future technology transactions between technology
  suppliers and technology recipients. </p>
<p>The need for government's commitment in the transfer and development of technology
  as shown in the different cases studied in this chapter is vital for the transfer
  process. This is true for both technology suppliers and technology recipients.
  Technology suppliers need to demonstrate their commitment by providing conditions
  that stimulate technology outflows, while technology recipients have to demonstrate
  their will by providing the enabling environment for the private sector's participation.
  Building indigenous technological capacities increases the technology receptivity
  of a country. This activity is extremely important for technology recipients,
  as is the improvement of their overall business environment. These attributes
  will attract foreign and local investments along with technology inflows. Establishing
  a partnership between government and the private sector can contribute to useful
  technological relationships involving transfer. High quality manpower with a
  supporting industrial infrastructure is the main factor that drives technology
  growth in a country. This provides the capacity for &quot;un-packaging&quot;
  technology imports, effective R&amp;D policy, and the drive to select vital
  technology imports for further development. The important role of government
  in the process is summarised below:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Formulating the national transport development strategies, including encouraging
    or restricting certain transport options. </li>
  <li> Providing market development support for increased investments in the transfer
    of existing environmentally sound transport technologies and fuels, and support
    for their further development.</li>
  <li> Supporting R&amp;D and demonstration projects related to the advantages
    of environmentally sound transport options.</li>
  <li> Setting and enforcing standards for improved efficiency and GHG emission
    controls</li>
  <li> Giving preferential support through fiscal and other measures for environmentally
    sounds transport modes.</li>
  <li> Promoting the expanded use of information networks to foster technology
    transfer</li>
  <li> Using regional market opportunities to stimulate closer inter-government
    interests and government-industry relationships and interactions </li>
  <li> Promoting local and external investments including co-financing programmes</li>
  <li> Providing policy and regulatory frameworks for fiscal incentives for alternative
    fuel use and distribution infrastructure, and mechanisms for internalising
    social costs of transport.</li>
  <li> Promoting international cooperation in making available necessary financial
    resources through regional and international financial institutions for programmes
    such as collaborative R&amp;D and demonstration, and information exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>A significant number of transport options exist now and will be developed in
  the future that will reduce GHG emissions significantly, but they need to be
  transferred to where they are needed once certain implementing barriers can
  be overcome. Similarly, policy and measures are available that can transfer
  some of these options using the different stakeholders. Creating an enabling
  environment for effective participation of the private sector is very important
  for both technology outflows and inflows. In addition, improving the overall
  business environment will enhance investments and technology inflows. Exploiting
  the facilitating role of multilateral agencies will assist the adoption of the
  transport options discussed. The will and political commitment of all governments
  is crucial for the process of technology transfer and development. </p>
<p>The inflexibility in the transport sector due to its fossil fuel dependency
  and entrenched interests will need to change by departing from present lifestyles
  and travel patterns, if the current growth in transport-related GHG emissions
  is to be decreased. </p>
