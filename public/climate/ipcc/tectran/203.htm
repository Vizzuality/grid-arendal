<h3>10.5.2 Programmes and Policies for Technology Transfer between Countries</h3>
<p><i>Assessment</i><br>
  In most developing countries, government used to be the major actor in the energy
  supply sector. With the emerging privatisation wave public utilities are losing
  their monopolistic advantage and opening opportunities for private entrepreneurs.
  The government is losing importance as an energy supplier, but still has an
  important role in the sector as controller, and as the responsible body for
  the definition of policies which can shape the energy market (e.g. regulation,
  market-based incentives). Government interest is the major single item able
  to define the country attitude regarding GHG emission control. For example,
  under the auspices of the US EPA Coal Bed Methane Program, technology transfer
  to other major coal mining states is being promoted. For example, Coal Bed Methane
  Centres or Clearinghouses have been set up to help overcome economic and institutional
  barriers to technology transfer in China and Russia. These centres promote information
  exchange, demonstration projects, and commercial development. Also, the Asian
  Pacific Economic Council (APEC) is starting a coal mine gas project to recover
  and utilise methane from deep coal mines in Southeast Asian countries.</p>
<p>The choice of generating technologies for capacity expansion is deeply influenced
  by the planning tools available. Energy plans rely strongly on the knowledge
  and manpower from utilities, which greatly prefer the old technologies they
  are familiar with, and often distrust new technologies. Quite often their actions
  optimise only the energy supply side and do not take demand into account. The
  integrated resource planning (IRP)<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#8" onClick="showFootnote(11,8); return false;">8</a></small></sup>
  approach is a valuable tool to examine the potential and barriers for new technology
  transfer, and thus to stimulate the analysis of the interventions governments
  could prescribe to overcome these barriers. In many industrialised countries,
  IRP is introduced by law. In Denmark, for example, the electric utilities are
  required to present such plans and to update them on a regular basis. In developing
  countries IRP is being done when required, but it also can provide substantive
  information on the technology priorities for development of the energy system.
  In China, for example, an extensive study on the energy sector development using
  the IRP approach was conducted recently. The study explored options, effects
  and costs of GHG mitigation in the energy demand versus energy supply. Hydro,
  nuclear and wind options were considered (IEA, 1997). The role of IRP is changing
  under the conditions of a liberalised market. It provides a basis for a dialog
  between companies and the government with respect to the objectives of the future
  technology development and deployment, and the policy framework necessary to
  support these objectives. The presence of the government, which is likely have
  a better and broader view of the country's requirements, is imperative when
  energy plans are under development (Greene and Hallberg,1995):</p>
<p>Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) are financing many activities necessary
  to ensure the transfer of technology. For example, they finance building institutional
  capacity, establishing research centres and funding demonstration projects.
  The World Bank funding of ESTs is estimated to be approximately US$ 2 to 3 billion
  per year. Acting as a lead investor, however, these banks have influenced a
  significantly larger proportion of the total investment in ESTs. Environmental
  loans totalled US$ 1.63 billion and MDBs leveraged another US$ 1.64 billion
  in fiscal year 1996 (United Nations, 1997). ODA has addressed about 3% (US$
  1.3 billion) of total reported bilateral energy assistance to renewable projects
  (except large hydro) between 1979 and 1991 (Kozloff and Shobowale, 1994)<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#9" onClick="showFootnote(11,9); return false;">9</a></small></sup>
  . </p>
<p>Regional organisations have an important function at this stage of technology
  transfer, since they have a number of generic strategies that can promote and/or
  facilitate the implementation of some of the emission reduction options described
  in this Report. These strategies (Von Hippel, 1996) could include, but are certainly
  not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>Provide Information and General Training to Government Officials - Getting
  initiatives such as industrial energy efficiency, and utility boiler emissions
  control programmes, and fuel switching/renewable energy initiatives off the
  ground in most developing countries (particularly China and India) will be impossible
  without top officials embracing the concept. Consequently, the advantages and
  local/international opportunities provided by the measures and technologies
  must be presented to top officials in a manner that is both forceful and forthright<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#10" onClick="showFootnote(11,10); return false;">10</a></small></sup>
  .</p>
<p>Provide Specific Information and Training to Local Actors - Training of a very
  specific and practical nature must be provided to personnel at the local level.
  Examples include workshops and courses for factory energy plant managers, and
  power plant and heating system operators; and new job classifications such as
  energy-efficiency and pollution control equipment installers, energy auditors,
  and environmental officials.</p>
<p>Encourage the Implementation and Enforcement of Energy and Environmental Standards
  - Although some countries of Northeast Asia and Latin America have general policies
  supporting energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, not all have
  a well-defined, quantitative set of standards in place to codify these general
  policies. Where standards exist, furthermore, they may not be stringent enough
  to satisfy GHG emissions reduction targets. Once standards are set, it will
  be necessary to create the capability to enforce them by recruiting and training
  enforcement personnel and supplying them with the tools necessary to do their
  job, as well as the high-level administrative support needed for credible implementation
  of sanctions. Setting up these regulations and support structures is an area
  where international assistance may be valuable for some countries.</p>
<p>Establish Programmes of Grants and Concessional Loans - Experience in China
  has shown that such a programme in itself can have a significant positive impact
  in overall sectorial energy efficiency (Liu et al., 1994). The benefits of institutionalising
  support for pollution control and energy efficiency, however, would go beyond
  those obtained through the various individual projects themselves. Creating
  government agencies or corporations with their own budgets would signal a strong
  commitment to acid gas and GHG emissions reduction on the part of the government,
  and would create a constituency within official circles for promoting EST (see
  <a href="331.htm">Case Study 3</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>). Moreover,
  by establishing a pool of funds for which government ministries, sectors, and/or
  individual enterprises could compete, it would stimulate at all levels awareness
  of the potential, methods, and technologies for reducing local, regional and
  global gas emissions (see <a href="352.htm">Case Study 24</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter
  16</a>).</p>
<p>Promote Joint Ventures and Licensing Agreements - The growth in the need for
  pollution control and energy efficient equipment could be met by domestic production
  through joint ventures and licensing agreements between governmental or private
  organisations in developing countries and foreign companies with the necessary
  expertise to produce the needed equipment. For example, a wide variety of efficient
  industrial equipment and controls - including adjustable speed drives, higher-efficiency
  electric motors, and improved industrial boilers - have already been introduced
  to China through commercial channels and are being or will be manufactured there.</p>
<p>The effort of such organisations in promoting EST cannot be neglected. The
  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) over the last two decades committed
  over US$ 400 million to energy sector activities, and funded more than 900 projects
  in energy planning, energy efficiency and conservation, conventional energy,
  electric power, nuclear energy, and new and renewable energy. Such UNDP funding
  helped energy-endowed developing countries develop their resources and train
  national staff in cost-effective and environmentally cleaner methods of producing
  and using energy resources. Despite its success, UNDP energy assistance was
  fragmented, reflecting the constantly shifting international consensus about
  what is needed (renewables in the 1970s; conservation in the 1980s and concern
  about the environment in the 1990s) (Gururaja,1995). Also, the amount of financial
  support (on average US$ 20 million/yr in the last two decades) is quite small
  to induce significant results in the energy sector<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#11" onClick="showFootnote(11,11); return false;">11</a></small></sup>
  . Most of the contribution has been in providing information on feasible projects
  (ESMAP activities), provision of small-scale lending for renewable energy (FINESSE
  initiatives) and acting as an intermediary to obtain loans from multilateral
  lenders. One of the areas most benefited by UNDP actions has been the use of
  renewable sources of energy, promoted as early as 1981 in the UN Conference
  on New and Renewable Sources of Energy in Nairobi. Another very useful contribution
  of many regional organisations has been the promotion of non-commercial energy
  technology transfer through many international conferences, employment of personnel
  through technical assistance programmes, education and training of host country's
  labour force and information databases.</p>
<p><i>Agreement and Implementation</i><br>
  Availability of capital is the major obstacle for the implementation of a selected
  technology. The gap between the foreign exchange needs of developing countries
  in the power sector and total aid flows from abroad implies that total investments
  will have to be reduced, foreign aid increased, domestic finance increased,
  or private foreign investment increased even more<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#12" onClick="showFootnote(11,12); return false;">12</a></small></sup>
  . All these options play a role in the oil sector and in the power sector expansion,
  but the last is the most likely to dominate (Barnett, 1992).</p>
<p>Oil and natural gas are being produced in many developing countries through
  one or several of the following arrangements: concession, production-sharing
  contracts, risk service contracts, service contracts, joint ventures and nationalisation.
  Excluding nationalisation, all other arrangements are made between an International
  Oil Company (IOC) and the Government, usually through the National Oil Company
  (NOC). This means that agreement and implementation procedures for technology
  transfer are well established. With the emerging privatisation wave, opportunities
  for FDI are growing (see <a href="fig994.htm">Figure 9.4</a>, <a href="168.htm">Chapter
  9</a>).</p>
<p>Laws allowing increased presence of the private sector in the oil and gas markets,
  as well as laws allowing private electric power sales, are no guarantee that
  power generation markets will develop or that EST will be used. Nevertheless,
  improvements in the efficiency of energy supply should be achieved through improving
  efficiency in oil exploration and exploitation, in power generation, transmission
  and distribution, and increased investments in system-interconnections. Through
  competition it is expected that improved efficiency will occur. Global conversion
  losses in these areas are responsible for 85 EJ or 22 per cent of global commercial
  energy used in 1990 (SAR II-B1, 1996).</p>
<p>For energy production from conventional energy sources, usually based in large
  centralised plants, FDI can be the preferred option. The investment required
  may be unavailable in the host country, so FDI can very quickly create new job
  opportunities, raise technological and educational levels of the labour force,
  transfer technical and management skills, and help the local R&amp;D institutions.
  Nevertheless, it is important to remember that through FDI various elements
  of the technology are supplied in &quot;bundled&quot; or &quot;packaged&quot;
  form (Able-Thomas, 1996). FDI enables the technology supplier to retain ownership
  and to exercise control over the new production plant which is inconvenient
  to the host country from a technology transfer viewpoint, but provides a flow
  of productive capital from one country to another (Able-Thomas, 1996). Thus,
  FDI is suitable for the energy sector where technological progress and spin-off
  opportunities are less common, as is the case of mature technologies like hydroelectricity,
  or for the manufacturing of solar cells and PV modules where technological improvements
  are occurring so fast that developing countries have little chance of recovering
  commercial investments from the technology before it becomes obsolete (Able-Thomas,
  1996).</p>
<p>Government has a significant role as a promoter of ESTs, since a large part
  of the R&amp;D money used is coming from public sources. Policies for the diffusion
  and accelerated transfer of publicly funded ESTs are available (Korea, 1998),
  and include financial incentives for their transfer to developing countries
  and promotion of the transfer of uncommercialised publicly funded R&amp;D results
  to enhance capacity building in developing countries and CEITs. For other energy
  supply technologies with small commercial markets, which are still in the development
  stage, or are publicly owned, joint ventures and licensing may be a more appropriate
  way for technology transfer. Joint ventures are dependent on a reasonable national
  partner with similar technological capabilities and complementary skills and
  resources, and necessary where relations with host-country governments and institutions
  would be difficult for foreign companies (partners) alone (Chowdhury, 1992).
  At the other extreme comes licensing, which is of value if the transfer is limited
  to product and processes that the nation is capable of producing or using at
  internationally competitive costs, or products serving purely domestic markets,
  for which neither imports or exports are an option (Able-Thomas, 1996).</p>
<p>Even considering the strong and emerging presence of the private sector in
  energy supply there are other important actors involved in technology transfer.</p>
<p>MDBs influence private financial markets to support technology transfer. At
  the macro level, this is done by encouraging financial reforms in banking, privatisation,
  and stock market development. At the micro level, influence comes through developing,
  demonstrating and transferring the innovative financial instruments needed to
  accelerate access to technology (United Nations, 1997). In the short term the
  most effective contribution of MDBs regarding GHG abatement is through the money
  used to fund and leverage other loans in the energy sector (see <a href="342.htm">Case
  Study 14</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>). MDBs have significant leadership
  in this sector, and in the period 1991 to 1995, 44% of all the external financing
  of infrastructure in developing countries has been addressed to this sector
  (United Nations, 1997). Funding has impacted GHG emission through the large
  share which financed hydroelectric plants and the share invested in promoting
  sectorial reforms in favour of competition in the developing countries' power
  sector (World Bank, 1994). These actions abated GHG through the options of switching
  to renewable sources of energy and more efficient conversion of fossil fuels
  to power and heat. Loans to thermoelectric plants and oil refineries also impacted
  GHG emission, since it is assumed that under the MDB management, projects are
  more technically appropriate to the country economy with implications on efficiency
  optimisation of plants (United Nations,1997).</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the pilot phase of the Global Environmental Facility
  (GEF)<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#13" onClick="showFootnote(11,13); return false;">13</a></small></sup>
  a total US$ 5.2 billion have been allocated to climate change activities. Of
  this sum, US$ 775 million was provided in grants from the GEF Trust Fund. An
  additional US$ 4.4 billion was contributed through co-financing (GEF, 1998).
  About one third of these projects are to enhance penetration of advanced renewable
  and cogeneration technologies in the developing countries' energy markets, such
  as PV, solar-thermal hybrid technology, micro-hydro and biomass. Another objective
  of these projects is to improve energy facilities operation, production management
  and marketing capabilities (GEF, 1997). A very interesting example is the US$
  6 million joint USAID/India and GEF project to prevent GHG emissions, which
  addresses the major market, financial and institutional barriers that hinder
  penetration of the modern energy supply technologies. The first, near-term component
  of the project aims at introducing cost-effective conversion measures and state-of-the-art
  coal technologies at the existing power plants. The second, long-term component
  promotes more efficient bagasse (sugarcane processing residue) cogeneration
  technologies based on high pressure multi-fuel boilers and high-efficiency turbines.
  This component will provide incremental cost support for six demonstration projects
  in addition to the technical assistance, training and cost-shared research grants
  for developing cane trash and other biomass fuels. (Climate Action Report, 1997).</p>
<p>In the same way as the World Bank has exhibited leadership in requiring developing
  countries' hydroelectric projects to take into account social and local environmental
  issues, MDBs have the capability to enforce international regulations on GHG
  emissions and promote the use of International Standards (ISO-series), in addition
  to their traditional role of addressing funding and verifying the feasibility
  of EST projects. One difficulty associated with these actions is the necessity
  to invest in projects based on new technologies that conflict with the traditional
  posture of most of these institutions, which are technologically risk adverse
  (ECOSOC, 1994).</p>
<p>Another multilateral source of support for transfer of climate friendly energy
  supply technologies to CEITs is the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
  (EBRD). In fact, EBRD is the first international financial institution with
  a proactive environmental mandate, having sustainable development goals among
  its highest priorities. Its objective is to foster the transition of the CEITs
  to a market driven economy and to promote entrepreneurial initiative.</p>
<p>Bilateral organisations have special programmes with technology transfer as
  an objective. For example the Japanese government provides technical assistance
  in the electric power field through studies of project development, training
  of overseas technicians, sending industry experts overseas, etc. Development
  studies consists of initial master-plan development and preliminary best-plan
  scenario development, and feasibility studies requested from partner-countries.
  Total loans from the Japanese government equal nearly &yen; 1,000 (approx. US$
  9.5) billion in 1991. Of this total, &yen; 100 (approx. US$ 0.95) billion is
  in the electric power field. Of this aid, &yen; 40 (approx. US$ 0.38) billion
  is for hydroelectric power development assistance. In the period 1959 to 1991,
  the total amount of loans the Japanese government offered in the hydropower
  field was &yen; 700 (approx. US$ 6.6) billion (Fujino, 1994). Another example
  is the Swedish government programme for biomass boiler conversion in the Baltic
  states (see <a href="346.htm">Case Study 18</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>).</p>
<p>As is well known, an important objective of many bilateral aid programmes is
  to promote donor country exports of goods and services (Kozloff and Shobowale,
  1994). Although the distinction between development assistance and export promotion
  is frequently blurred, it is no accident that bilateral donors often direct
  assistance to technologies and products in which they have a comparative advantage
  in domestic world markets (e.g. The Energy Policy Act, 1998). Under this approach,
  more sophisticated alternative technologies are being promoted in the energy
  supply sector. Most of the resources have been addressed to increasing the use
  of renewables through geothermal energy, wind resources and photovoltaic cells.
  Also, technology transfer is mostly provided through provision of equipment.
  There is little support for developing human capabilities for environmentally
  sustainable energy technology, which is strongly needed by developing countries
  (der Werff et al., 1994). </p>
<p>Considering the emerging presence of the private capital in the energy sector
  of the developing countries and the relatively small amount of incentives provided
  by the GEF, World Bank, Regional Development Organisations and Bilateral Organisations
  compared to the amount of investment needed in the energy sector, as extensively
  discussed in this section, it is necessary to recognise that incentives are
  almost non existent for the governments of these countries to stop using their
  cheap natural resource of coal and oil in favour of more expensive, imported
  ecologically-friendly fuels such as LNG or pipeline gas.</p>
<p> <i>Evaluation &amp; Adjustment</i><br>
  Adjustment is almost always needed due the difference in infrastructure, social,
  and economic system of the technology provider and recipient countries (see
  <a href="331.htm">Case Studies 3</a> and <a href="333.htm">5</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter
  16</a>). Creation of labour opportunities is a high priority in most developing
  countries. Due to the large investments in the energy supply sector, the potential
  number of job opportunities are often underestimated. Adjustment in favour of
  manpower versus automation is important. Heavy automation implies more importation
  of goods and more hard currency expenditures, which is seriously constrained
  in developing countries and CEITs.</p>
<p>Evaluation of all potential gains in the technology recipient country must
  be performed with care, including short, medium, and long-term views, checking
  all aspects considered important for the country's development by extrapolating
  the energy boundary. As an example, in the oil sector, there is already a well-established
  system for technology transfer from International Oil Companies (IOCs) and the
  Government, usually through the National Oil Companies (NOCs)<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#14" onClick="showFootnote(11,14); return false;">14</a></small></sup>
  (Barrows, 1993). Technology transfer occurs through provision of state of the
  art technology and capacity building, such as training. Most legislation or
  contracts today contain provisions obliging the IOCs to provide training of
  nationals of the host country (personnel from NOCs, the Government, and relevant
  government agencies (Barrows, 1993). Transfer of more detailed technology is
  required in some countries (such as Norway), and this necessitates a special
  agreement to assure patent protection and secrecy regarding technical processes
  (Barrows, 1993). On the other side, the combination of business and social objectives
  is a feature of the public-private partnership requiring disbursement of IOC
  money in the economic and social development of host countries (See 
  <a href="203.htm#b102">Box 10.2</a>
  and <a href="341.htm">Case Study 13</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>).
  Indirect technology transfer is induced through agreements on Preference for
  Use of Domestic Goods and Services. Generally the legislation obliges the oil
  companies to purchase domestically produced goods and services, if they are
  available at competitive terms; in particular the World Bank financed projects
  allow a cost differential of up to 15% in favour of local suppliers. Because
  of potential demand by the IOCs, the national suppliers of goods are stimulated
  to search and make arrangements for acquisition of new technologies which can
  make their products and services more competitive.</p>
<p>From the above example it is clear that technology transfer has been used by
  the recipient country as a way to get fuel, job opportunities, commercial and
  industrial activities, hard-currency savings or gains, human and institutional
  capacity building, and social and economic development. All of these gains must
  be properly evaluated by the country's society. Lessons must be derived from
  past experiences and results used for better agreements able to promote even
  more country development.</p>

<p><i>Replication </i><br>
  Opportunities for replication of the new technology are favourable in developing
  countries due the large and rapidly growing energy supply markets. Developing
  Countries now have the opportunity to promote innovative energy technologies
  that would be helpful in meeting their sustainable development objectives (Reddy
  et al., 1997). Adoption of advanced technologies not only provides increases
  in the energy supply, but can also provide opportunities to fulfil one of the
  characteristics of technology transfer. This is putting it into operation in
  its new environment, and through incremental innovation (small improvements
  in existing products and process, or relatively small extensions of the scope
  of existing applications of the product design or technology (Greene and Halberg,1995))
  producing major changes on behalf of the country's economy. Incremental innovations
  generate new business opportunities that do not require the same level of advanced
  knowledge necessary for radical innovations. Developing countries with a minimum
  level of basic education in their work force and minimum industrial experience
  may be able to capitalise on these opportunities quite successfully, often at
  lower cost than industrialised countries.</p>
<p>Trade, which is an important system for technology transfer<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#15" onClick="showFootnote(11,15); return false;">15</a></small></sup>
  , has a direct impact on the energy supply system of developing countries and
  CEITs. In general, trade liberalisation can have a positive effect on the environment,
  by helping to allocate resources more efficiently, provided effective environmental
  policies are implemented (OECD, 1994; OECD, 1995a). Since energy is an ingredient
  always present in products and services, international competition poses price
  constraints on it, stimulating more efficient use of primary fuels in the energy
  sector. However, search for lower energy prices can stimulate the use of cheap
  fuels (e.g. coal), which are intrinsically environmentally aggressive, or can
  be as such, due to the shortage of investments in end-of-pipe cleaning equipment.
  Thus the enforcement of effective environmental policies is a necessary condition
  to increase the positive and decrease the negative environmental effects of
  trade liberalisation. A quite serious problem that needs to be addressed is
  conflict between existing trade rules and environmental issues (see 
  <a href="203.htm#b103">Box10.3</a>).</p>

    <td>Trade issues became more complex when the various stages of the product's
      life cycle are at issue (i.e. processes and production methods - PPMs).
      For example, recent packaging and recycling requirements which address environmental
      issues, but which are associated with the disposal stage of the product
      life cycle, have caused some trade concerns. This is because waste reduction
      policies tend to have a national focus, and can thereby impose relatively
      higher costs on importers, amounting to de facto protection for domestic
      products (OECD, 1997). To date, trade rules have been interpreted as precluding
      policy differentiation on the basis of non-product related PPM requirements
      (the ones that do not affect product characteristics, but generate an environmental
      impact at the production stage, such as emissions). Similarly, adjusting
      the price of imported products at the border, to account for the additional
      cost incurred by domestic industry in complying with non-product related
      PPM requirements has generally been considered to be incompatible with existing
      trade rules (OECD, 1997).
      <p>An interesting case is import taxes set to a certain level for products,
	without any consideration of the implicit environmental benefits. </p>

<p>Shortage of money is a serious obstacle for any project development. This chronic
  issue in developing countries is even aggravated by the difficulty that innovative
  projects are usually undertaken by small enterprises. Larger enterprises traditionally
  finance their projects through corporate financing, where the assets of the
  corporation are used as a guarantee. Small enterprises must rely mostly on project
  finance where the guarantee for a loan is provided by the cash-flow of the project.</p>
<p>Innovative third party financing can be obtained through multilateral organisations
  (i.e. GEF), but with limited availability of funds. Joint Implementation (JI)
  and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) can be a way of directing investment
  to CEITs and developing countries. Money from the private sector may be more
  available than from government organisations depending on the incentives.</p>
<p>The participation of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) has become important
  to the growth of simple distributed energy supply facilities which have low
  energy output and relatively low capital cost. For example, an important intervention
  programme to alleviate the rural energy crisis in India has been the dissemination
  of biogas technology among rural households through which 2.5 million individual
  biogas plants were constructed up until March 1997. The diffusion of such biomass
  technology has relied on the cooperation among government agencies, private
  firms, and NGOs. Technological exchange with China led to the adaptation from
  the floating dome biogas technology to the less experienced fixed dome biogas
  technology, mainly because capital subsidy remained with the organisations -
  mainly the NGOs - which were constructing the plants. Most technological improvements
  were incremental and resulted from local innovations (Ramana and Shukla, 1998).</p>
<p>Commercialisation of new technologies is an important part of the innovation
  process, and policies to facilitate these actions are urgently needed in developing
  countries and CEITs. Although developing countries' enterprises may be developing
  renewable energy technologies and have advanced scientific and technical capabilities
  and skilled workforces, the translation of these capabilities into commercial
  products is still a major problem. The associated market-oriented skills and
  institutions to take full advantage of these technological capabilities are
  still poor.</p>
<p>In Russia these market-related deficiencies are the persistent legacy of the
  former Soviet paradigm of central economic planning and development. Central
  planning avoided the need for many market-oriented skills and created a variety
  of disincentives and structural economic conditions that stifled innovation,
  creativity, efficiency, and quality (Cooper, 1991; Nove, 1986; Martinson and
  Valdemars, 1992). Key underdeveloped capabilities are business management, finance
  systems, marketing, creative product development and innovation, quality assurance
  and economic analysis (like cost-benefit and life cycle analyses); and legal,
  contracting, and accounting skills. Quality assurance, statistical quality control,
  management for quality, and other methods common in the West are uncommon in
  Russian industries (but not in the military sector), because incentives in the
  Soviet economic system emphasised quantity over quality. Another problem is
  the excessive presence of monopolies in Russia. In Poland, the Czech Republic,
  and Hungary markets are being developed while these countries have also been
  out of the market economy for 50 years. Thus, business planning and training
  will be helpful, but only if there is a market environment to use them (Martinot,
  1999).</p>
<p>Other important aspects of commercialisation are continuous product improvement
  and cost reduction. As an example, product improvement was often intentionally
  avoided in the former Soviet economic system because enterprise incentives encouraged
  quantity over quality, and because design changes could mean changes in needed
  inputs that might not be available. For example, in the West, extensive experience
  with operating and maintaining wind turbines through commercial markets over
  the past 15 years has led to a refinement of designs and cost reductions. This
  experience has been critical to the current success of modern wind turbines.
</p>
<p>A promising process for speeding up the commercialisation of new and renewable
  sources of energy is through the acquisition of small companies with good products
  in the energy supply sector by large ones with well established positions in
  the energy market. Small companies find it difficult to commercialise their
  products worldwide, while this can be an easier process for large companies.
  Several energy multinationals are taking up the commercialisation challenge
  of renewables by drastically expanding their investments and acquisitions in
  the area of solar, biomass and wind technologies. With the exception of the
  two Japanese companies, Kyocera and Sharp, all companies with a global PV market
  share above 10% are owned by large energy companies such as Siemens, BP, Amoco
  and Enron. Shell has recently established a fifth business group under the name
  of Shell International Renewables. Although still dwarfed by the other groups
  in every respect, it signifies a strong commitment to renewables. Half a billion
  (US) dollars of investment will be spent in the first five years of operation.
  Concentrating on PV, forestry and biomass power, Shell intends to obtain a strong
  position in rural energy development by coupling biomass plantations with local
  power production. Similar trends are evident in the wind power industry. Although
  independent producers are still strong, mergers and acquisitions are increasing.
