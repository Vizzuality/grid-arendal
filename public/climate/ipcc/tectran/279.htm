<h3>14.3.3 Population Vulnerability: Technological</h3>
<p>A population's technological vulnerability necessarily reflects its economic
  conditions and cultural values. However, it refers particularly to the extent
  and quality of those of its technologies that would, intentionally or unintentionally,
  affect the health impacts of climate change. Some technologies affect basic
  community vulnerability; other technologies affect the capacity to prevent or
  treat specific injuries and diseases. The former category includes such things
  as: urban design (influencing the heat island effect); types of air-conditioning
  (domestic evaporative coolers in New Delhi, India, largely accounted for an
  outbreak of dengue in 1997); capacity and integrity of sewer systems (in various
  rapidly-expanding developing country cities, systems are seriously overloaded
  and would be unable to cope with an increase in precipitation intensity); wholesale
  and retail food storage and safety inspection facilities (could be a source
  of summer food poisoning outbreaks in warmer climate); housing design (control
  of infectious disease vectors); and coastal barriers commensurate with projected
  sea level rise and storm surges. The latter category includes such things as:
  public education systems (especially via popular media); vaccination programmes;
  health-care system capacity, accessibility and organisation; disaster response
  capacity; and food reserves and food distribution system. Current barriers to
  the implementation of public health &quot;technologies&quot; are listed in 
  <a href="279.htm#t143">Table 14.3</a>.</p>
