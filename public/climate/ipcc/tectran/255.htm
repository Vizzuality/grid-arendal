<h1>13.1 Introduction<sup><small><a href="fn14.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(14,1); return false;">1</a></small></sup>
</h1>
<p>Methane is generated from solid waste and wastewater through the anaerobic
  decomposition of the organic component of the waste stream. Each of these sources
  is believed to account for about 10% of human-induced methane emissions, although
  there are large uncertainties in the precise emission levels (IPCC 1996a, WGII,
  Section 22.4.4.1). In the future, methane emissions from these sources are expected
  to grow, with the largest increases expected in developing countries. Population
  and economic growth are the major drivers behind the rising emission levels
  of developing countries. In addition, current efforts to improve solid waste
  and wastewater management will affect future emission levels. If developing
  countries pursue solid waste disposal in large landfills and anaerobic wastewater
  treatment without including methane recovery technologies, emissions could increase
  significantly. There are a variety of technologies and approaches available
  that require less capital, use less complicated technologies and avoid GHG emissions.
  These technologies may be particularly appropriate in developing countries,
  but could also be more widely used in industrialised countries. The key challenge
  will be ensuring that the opportunities are identified and implemented.</p>
<p>Solid waste disposal sites (landfills and open dumps) are reported to emit
  about 20-40 Mt of methane (or 110-230 Mt Carbon-equivalent, based on a 100-year
  GWP of 21), with the largest share of emissions coming from Annex I countries.
  Emissions from most Annex I countries are expected to remain stable or decline
  over the next 10-20 years (IEA, 1996). A recent review of national communications
  and the Second Compilation and Synthesis report, for example, estimated that
  overall Annex I emissions from solid waste disposal sites were 24 Mt (138 MtCe)
  in 1990 and are estimated to fall slightly to 23 Mt (132 MtCe) in 2010 (USEPA,
  1999a). The principal reasons cited are increasing attention on reducing the
  amount of organic material disposed of in landfills and the expanded use of
  methane collection systems. In contrast, methane emissions from developing countries
  are expected to increase in the future (IEA, 1996). Key factors are population
  growth, additional waste generation associated with economic development, and
  the continuing priority of many developing countries to reduce unmanaged dumping
  and develop larger, solid waste disposal sites, which typically have higher
  methane emissions. If, however, the use of locally appropriate technologies
  that avoid methane generation is expanded, and those solid waste landfills that
  remain essential are modified to include methane recovery systems, then methane
  emissions could be significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Methane emissions from domestic and industrial wastewater disposal are estimated
  to be about 30-40 Mt (170-230 Mt Ce) annually (IPCC 1996a, WG II, Section 22.4.4.1).
  Industrial processes, principally food processing and pulp and paper, are the
  major contributor, accounting for up to 95% of total emissions from this source.
  Domestic and commercial wastewater emissions are believed to emit only about
  2 Mt of methane annually (USEPA, 1997a). Most countries only report domestic
  wastewater emissions in their National Communications; these emissions are expected
  to decline slightly in Annex I countries between 1990 and 2010. Emissions are
  believed to be significantly higher in developing countries, where domestic
  sewage and industrial waste streams are often unmanaged or maintained under
  anaerobic conditions without methane control. Future emissions are expected
  to grow, primarily driven by population and industrial growth. Emission levels
  are highly uncertain, however, and depend heavily on the rate at which wastewater
  infrastructure is developed. To the extent that developing countries successfully
  expand wastewater management services and reduce the proportion of their wastewater
  managed anaerobically without methane control, emissions would be lower than
  under a &quot;business as usual&quot; case.</p>
