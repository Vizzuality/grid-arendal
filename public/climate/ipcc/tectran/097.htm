<h3>5.2.2 Official Development Assistance</h3>
<p> It is increasingly recognised that ODA should not be seen as a leading source
  for investment in environmentally sound and cleaner technologies, but rather
  be used to address the fundamental determinants of development, which include
  a sound policy environment, strong investment in human capital, well-functioning
  institutions and governance systems and environmental sustainability (Killick,
  1997; OECD, 1998a). This realisation has arisen partly from the policy view
  among donors that aid should not go to sectors where the private sector can
  take the lead role, and also from the mixed experience with development aid
  programmes. The dominance of certain interests in donor governments led most
  industrialised countries to promote economic and geo-political goals - e.g.,
  contracts for their domestic firms, support for friendly political regimes -
  that often ran contrary to the fundamental development objectives. This has
  resulted in development aid and, in particular, to tied bilateral aid having
  a very mixed record. Problems range from the controversies over major projects
  such as big hydro-electricity projects, to the disappointments and failures
  of some programmes to support the transfer of smaller-scale renewable energy.
  ODA is still significant for the poorest developing countries, where it accounts
  for up to 20% of gross domestic product (GDP), with external private flows accounting
  for 3-4% on average (OECD, 1998b; see also <a href="022.htm">Section 2.2.2</a>
  in <a href="017.htm">Chapter 2</a> on ODA flows).<br>
  <br>
  The extent to which aid is tied to being donor-country supplied reveals the
  persistence of the tendency for development to be subordinated to other goals.
  Accurate estimates of the extent to which aid is tied are difficult to come
  by because of the multitude of ways it can be hidden in mixed credit financing.
  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that
  in 1996 tied aid accounted for around US$22 billion of a total of US$52 billion
  of official development assistance. Another estimate is that only half of the
  top 20 donor countries tie less than half their aid (Jain, 1996).<br>
  <br>
  Tied aid started in part because of industry pressure in donor countries. In
  the 1970s and 1980s, the effects of an overly simplistic approach to development
  through industrialisation, and the harmful effect of self-serving economic and
  political motives in the donor nations became noticeable. Increased unemployment,
  white elephant projects, rural-urban migration, foreign debts and growing technological
  dependency brought into question the appropriateness of the technology being
  transferred to developing countries (Chambers, 1997):<br>
  <br>
  Early beliefs of the 1950s and 1960s in linear and convergent development through
  stages of growth, in central planning, in unlimited growth, in industrialisation
  as the key to development, in the feasibility of a continuous improvement in
  levels of living for all- these have now been exposed as misconceived and, with
  the easy wisdom of hindsight, naive. Hundreds of millions of people are now
  worse off than twenty years ago.<br>
  <br>
  In the 1990s, the apparent absence of sustained economic and social improvement
  in many recipient countries, the end of the Cold War as a motive for providing
  aid to friendly nations, and budgetary constraints in donor countries have led
  to increased questioning of the effectiveness of overseas development assistance
  and to a sharp decline in aid flows (Graham and O'Hanlon, 1997). Funding might
  have declined even further in some countries were it not for industry in donor
  countries arguing for subsidies for exports, to protect jobs and to match subsidies
  provided by other donor nations to their firms (Morrissey, 1992), although in
  other countries there is more general public support for aid, partly based on
  its effectiveness. Thus, while aid has always been tied to some extent, the
  proportion of tied aid may have lately increased in importance<sup><small><a href="fn7.htm#3" onClick="showFootnote(7,3); return false;">3</a></small></sup>
  . <br>
  <br>
  Tied aid is less likely to promote economic growth in recipient countries than
  untied aid. Empirical studies suggest that tied aid increases costs for the
  acquiring country anywhere from 10 to 50% (Morrissey, 1992). In principle tied
  aid is better than no aid, and could be a positive sum transaction; in practice
  it often ends up that neither side benefits. The importation of more expensive,
  capital intensive, and inappropriate technologies creates a dependency for maintenance
  and spare parts. In general, the technology being imported may be a low national
  priority for the recipient country. <br>
  <br>
  The consequences of tied aid go beyond the distortion of technology choice.
  It inhibits the development of domestic capacity in selecting technology - technology
  choice becomes a matter of finding the biggest subsidy rather than the most
  appropriate technology. It can crowd out good technologies and viable business
  models. It also acts to prevent private financial institutions from becoming
  involved in supporting technology transfer and developing appropriate expertise,
  notably when tied aid finance is provided on greatly subsidised terms in order
  to [win/secure/procure exports. For example, there are few cases where aid finance
  has been useful in helping to mobilise private capital into technology transfer,
  or to support financial innovation and new forms of financing for technology
  transfer - most such work is being done by the multilateral development banks.
  The challenges of tied aid have been recognised by the donor community, and
  Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors have made important efforts to
  limit tied aid on the grounds that it limits the effectiveness of aid. Specifically,
  the &quot;OECD 1992 tied aid discipline&quot; prohibits subsidised finance (e.g.,
  to support manufacturing or power investment) to developing countries except
  the least developed countries or LDCs (OECD, 1998c). Nonetheless, there remains
  substantial scope for the abuse of tied aid. Transparency has been advocated
  as a way of reducing donor's use of tied aid, recipients' use of aid for short-term
  political and economic gains, and temptations to divert aid to private pockets
  (Lin See-Yan, 1997).<br>
  <br>
  Increasingly, there is recognition that aid can be more effective and useful
  to development if it is focused less on core financing of specific projects
  and more on areas such as capacity-building, in providing incentives for direct
  investment (public or private) or in supporting the public private partnerships
  discussed later in this chapter (OECD, 1998a):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> 
    Support for the dissemination of technological know-how must concentrate on
    developing the necessary human, scientific, technological, organisational,
    institutional and resource capabilities to underpin the long-term application
    of new technologies. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Specifically, this can include supporting development of the right policy mix,
  direct support for investment in appropriate technologies, or support for project
  preparation and development. That is to say that such support should be provided
  in the abstract - in many cases it will be more effective if linked to specific
  projects or programmes. Also, it is recognised that adapting assistance to local
  needs requires establishing working relationships among the various external
  and domestic actors involved and that coordination under the leadership of the
  host country is key (OECD, 1998a) </p>
