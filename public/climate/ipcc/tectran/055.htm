<h1>4.3 National Systems of Innovation and Technology Infrastructure </h1>
<p>Technology transfers are influenced greatly by what have been called &quot;national
  systems of innovation,&quot; which are the networks of institutions that initiate,
  modify, import and diffuse new technologies (Freeman, 1987; OECD 1999). The
  term &quot;national systems of innovation&quot; started as an analytical tool
  but has also become a mobilising concept to drive policy. The term is given
  different emphases in the literature. One definition is: &quot;the set of institutions
  to create, store and transfer the knowledge, skills and artifacts which define
  technological opportunities&quot; (Metcalfe, 1995). National systems of innovation
  reflect a complex mixture of institutions (e.g., financial; legal; scientific
  and technological; educational), public policies (regarding, e.g., taxation;
  export/import promotion; science, technology and innovation), and business and
  social relationships. </p>
<p>National systems of innovation depend upon the development of so-called technology
  infrastructure, &quot;a set of collectively supplied, specific, industry-relevant
  capabilities&quot; such as technology centres and educational and skills development
  institutions (Justman and Teubal, 1995, p. 260). &quot;Technology infrastructure
  consists of science, engineering and technical knowledge available to private
  industry. Such knowledge can be embodied in human, institutional, and facility
  forms. More specifically, technology infrastructure includes generic technologies,
  infratechnologies, technical information, and research and test facilities,
  as well as less technically-explicit areas including information relevant for
  strategic planning and market development, forums for joint industry-government
  planning and collaboration, and assignment of intellectual property rights.
  An important characteristic of technology infrastructure is that it depreciates
  slowly, but it requires considerable effort and long lead times to put in place
  and maintain.&quot; (Tassey, 1991, p.347)</p>
<p>Technology infrastructure may lack direct economic value to any one firm, and
  thus individual firms may lack adequate incentives to build technology infrastructure
  on their own. Thus policies to develop public technology infrastructure can
  build the capabilities that exist elsewhere but need to be imported, adapted,
  and absorbed in the local economy. Such policies include stimulating demand
  for technological capabilities through awareness-raising programmes and user-need
  determination; and building independent sources of such capabilities through
  learning-by-doing, training consultants and spinning off independent consulting
  services (Justman and Teubal, 1995, p.277). Institutional change and organisational
  development are critical to developing technology infrastructure, for example
  in promoting specific forms of networks through which capabilities can be acquired
  and disseminated.</p>
<p>National systems of innovation can influence a multitude of technologies simultaneously.
  But each technology may have it's own ''network(s) of agents interacting in
  each specific technology area under a particular institutional infrastructure
  for the purpose of generating, diffusing, and utilising technology'' (Carlsson
  and Stankiewicz, 1991, p.111). These networks may span across national boundaries,
  but are still subject to the influence of national culture, institutions, and
  policies (Dodgson and Bessant, 1996, p.25). &quot;Empirical work...gives strong
  support to the view that it is the overall system and the quality of interconnections
  within it which affects successful innovation&quot; (Dodgson and Bessant, 1996,
  p.54). And &quot;the pattern of technological innovation depends on much more
  than the behaviour of individual firms.&quot; (Archibugi and Michie, 1997, p.291).
  In addition, there has to be social cohesion for the process to work well, as
  Lundvall (1999) states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>today industrial and technology policies must be devised more broadly than
    has been the case- the societal framework is imperative for the effects of
    the policy. Learning is necessarily an interactive and socially-embedded process.
    Without a minimum of social cohesion the capability to master new technologies
    and new and more flexible forms of social organisation will be weak (Lundvall,
    1999, p. 19-20).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some explain this new approach in orthodox economic terms as an increased focus
  on &quot;social capital&quot;, <i>i.e.</i> a recognition that the ways in which
  actors organise themselves is important in explaining economic growth and development
  (World Bank, 1997b).</p>
<p>Policy interventions can address particular weaknesses in networks and support
  social cohesion. Policy objectives are not just to build firms' capabilities,
  but to facilitate the whole process of technological innovation by modifying
  the form or operation of networks (see <a href="055.htm#t42">Table 4.2</a>).
  This can include considerations of finance, marketing, organisation, training,
  relationships with customers and suppliers, competitive positioning as well
  as the relationship between products and processes. Thus, much of the material
  in <a href="051.htm">Chapters 4</a> and <a href="092.htm">5</a> relates indirectly
  back to the concepts of national systems of innovation discussed here.</p>

<p>Besides national-level systems of innovation, international (global) and subnational
  (regional) levels of innovation merit consideration (Freeman, 1999). One might
  think the trend towards globalisation might make national and regional systems
  of innovation less significant, but there is a complex interplay between these
  levels. New information technologies act as a powerful vehicle for the diffusion
  of information across distant communities. However, the process of generating
  and diffusing new technologies has been moulded and strengthened by flows of
  information and capital. Technology has facilitated globalisation and vice versa;
  technological change is both a factor in globalisation and one of its most important
  outcomes (Archibugi et al., 1999). Globalisation facilitates transmission of
  best-practice techniques and is also a vehicle for the international flow of
  goods and services. Because location-specific advantages are still important
  to multinational corporations, as they seek market niches with competitive advantages,
  these corporations have a major influence on national systems of innovation.
  Globalisation is causing the integration of disparate national systems of innovation
  that are geographically dispersed and locally specialised (Cantwell, 1999).
  The role of the local business environment on the competitive advantages of
  firms was already recognised by Porter (1990).<br>
  <br>
  The significance of the sub-national level (region) as a unit for economic analysis
  has long been recognised by economic geographers and has also been adopted in
  mainstream economics (Krugman, 1991; De Zooten-Dartenset, 1999). It is at the
  regional level that informal links between key personnel are formed and maintained
  and where economic decisions are most strongly influenced (Howells, 1999). Regional
  systems of innovation have been identified not to supplant the national systems
  of innovation approach, but rather to recognise that the national unit may be
  too large to allow a complete understanding of the dynamics of a technological
  system (Howells, 1999 after Metcalfe 1995). A concept similar to regional systems
  of innovation called &quot;learning regions&quot; has been used to elaborate
  how continuous social and technological learning can be established at the level
  of sub-national regions (Asheim, 1998; see <a href="055.htm#b41">Box 4.1</a>).
  In a learning region, organisational (social) and institutional innovations
  to promote technological cooperation and learning can appear at a regional level
  rather than just at a company level. Such innovations can also serve as tools
  for regional development. In November 1999, the UK Government announced regional
  planning would identify innovative 'high-tech' cluster areas to boost business
  and encourage growth (Planning, 1999). </p>

    <td> The concept of learning regions should be looked upon as a policy framework
      or model for formulations of partnership-based development strategies. All
      definitions of the concept emphasise the role played by cooperation and
      collective learning in regional clusters and networks understood as regional
      development coalitions. By the concept &quot;development coalition&quot;
      is meant a bottom-up, horizontally based cooperation between different actors
      in a local or regional setting, such as workers and managers within firms
      or in a network of firms, but also generally the mobilisation of resources
      in a broader societal context as such, to initiate a learning-based process
      of innovation, change and improvement. <br>
      <br>
      This definition of a learning region underlines the important role of innovation,
      understood as contextualised social processes of interactive learning, which
      highlights the significance of building social capital in order to foster
      cooperation, as well as transcending the artificial divide between high
      tech and low tech industries.<br>
      The concept of learning regions has become very popular with several international
      organisations, such as the OECD, as a strategy for institutional learning
      in order to promote regional development, as it at the same time promises
      growth and employment as well as social cohesion. <br>
      <br>
      DG VI of the European Commission has launched learning regions as a policy
      instrument; and in Sweden three municipalities have been established as
      learning regions, understood as development coalitions, as a part of a bottom-up
      restructuring policy. </td>

<p>Technology transfers, both within a country and betweeen countries, are influenced
  greatly by national systems of innovation--the institutional and organisational
  structures which support technological development and innovation. Governments
  can build or strengthen scientific and technical educational institutions and
  modify the form or operation of technology networks: the interrelated organisations
  generating, diffusing, and utilising technologies. The presence of regional
  and global systems of innovation interacting with national-level systems also
  has important implications for policy makers.</p>
