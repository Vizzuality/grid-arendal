<h1>11.2 Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Technologies </h1>
<p>Sustainable agricultural development is an ongoing priority for all countries.
  While the outlook for meeting the growth rates of production required to meet
  projected food needs by 2010 to 2030 appears reasonable with wider and more
  efficient use of existing technology and technology transfer for rice and maize
  or animal production, it seems less hopeful for crops that have a high proportion
  of their area in difficult eco-regions, that is, wheat, barley, sorghum, and
  millet (Oram and Hojjati, 1995). The challenges to adaptation will be significantly
  affected by the manner in which climate change effects are experienced. A slow
  change in climate over decades, without a significant change in variation and
  weather extremes, will facilitate adaptation by farmers themselves, and may
  demand little new technology transfer in itself. If the future effects include
  an increase in short-term weather extremes, the ability of farmers to adapt
  will be severely challenged, and improved technology transfer, such as more
  reliable long-term weather forecasting, will become critical to their ability
  to adapt.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that a changed climate will increase agricultural production
  in some regions. However, more effective technology transfer to developing countries
  and improved prices of grains could encourage farmers to adopt known adaptation
  and mitigation technology more widely than the present very low levels or, in
  some countries, to expand the area cropped. </p>
<p>The Green Revolution technologies and associated policies have played a major
  role in bringing about a rapid increase in crop yields. These technologies involve
  the use of high-yielding varieties, fertilisers, irrigation, and plant protection
  materials. In spite of yield improvements at a global level, crop yields vary
  considerably among regions and countries. For example, wheat yield varied between
  1.5 tonnes per hectare in Africa and 4.8 tonnes per hectare in Europe. Similarly,
  rice yields also varied between 2.0 tonnes per hectare in Africa and 7.4 tonnes
  per hectare in Oceania. These differences indicate that the available technologies
  are not equally adapted to all economic, cultural, or environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The large variations in crop yields among different countries and gaps between
  farmers' yields and experimental-station yields suggest that a considerable
  untapped potential exists to increase crop yields in developing countries and
  countries with economies in transition (CEITs). However, the realisation of
  this untapped potential depends on the existence of a stable and conducive policy
  environment. Technology transfer should be a high priority. </p>
