<h1>5.1 Introduction</h1>
<p> Finance is a critical aspect of technology transfer. This chapter reviews
  various funding sources and financial mechanisms for conducting EST transfers,
  and the types of partnerships and stakeholder relationships that can support
  technology transfers. The chapter looks at the practical issues involved and
  explores a range of mechanisms and approaches. As discussed in <a href="051.htm">Chapter
  4</a>, greater emphasis is being placed on more participatory models of technology
  transfer and creation of &quot;social infrastructure.&quot; This chapter continues
  this discussion with a review of different forms of public-private partnerships.
  <br>
  <br>
  Introduction of a new technology into a country usually requires investment,
  as does the diffusion of existing technologies within a country. Technology
  adaptation may also require substantial investments in design and/or production.
  Financing is also often required (and particularly difficult to obtain) in the
  early (developmental) phases of a technology transfer project or business. Without
  financing, very little technology investment or transfer takes place. The provision
  of financing depends upon those who have financial resources--whether governments
  or the private sector--being convinced that projects and the businesses that
  run them will justify the financial support or investment. And investment in
  ESTs and businesses will depend upon governments and private investors being
  convinced that these will justify--by whichever criteria they apply--the expenditure.
  This is the financial reality that underpins all technology investment and transfer
  processes. However, financing perspectives may differ enormously not only according
  to the project, technology and business, but according to the investor. Thus
  governments may offer a range of financing possibilities that differ radically
  from the private sector--and each contains enormous diversity itself.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="094.htm#t51">Table 5.1</a> summarises the policy tools available related
  to financing and partnerships, and the barriers these are designed to overcome.
  The chapter begins by considering the role and scope of participatory techniques
  to help promote stakeholder dialogues and partnership. The chapter then considers
  the investment decisions made by private firms that bear on climate-change mitigation
  and technology transfer for private-sector-driven pathways. Public-sector finance
  and investment, which is of key significance for many forms of transfer, is
  considered in terms of direct government finance, official development assistance,
  and multilateral development bank lending. The section on private-sector finance
  and investment, which is becoming increasingly important in both the national
  and international diffusion of technology, discusses a broad range of financial
  mechanisms and modalities for finance within the private sector. Because the
  relationship between the public and private sectors has already changed markedly
  in recent years in many countries, public-private partnerships are discussed.
  Public-private partnerships can combine the positive attributes of both sectors
  and provide increasingly important opportunities to promote technology transfer.
  Finally, technology intermediaries are discussed as important mechanisms to
  overcome barriers associated with information, management, technology, and financing.
