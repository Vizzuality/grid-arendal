<h3>15.6.4 Barriers to Transnational Technology Transfer</h3>
<p>Traditional barriers to technology transfer between countries, such as concerns
  by national governments about issues of national defence or economic competition,
  are generally not applicable to the transfer of coastal-adaptation technologies.
  However, government investment in R&amp;D is primarily mission-oriented and
  focuses on needs and capacities within the home country. Consequently, many
  technology transactions across countries tend to be driven by (the desire to
  sell) technology rather than by the needs and special requirements of the host
  country. On the other hand, host countries often lack the necessary infrastructure
  for developing a market for the technology. In addition, government officials
  may lack technology awareness, while the workforce may lack technical skills
  and expertise (BCSD, 1992).</p>
<p>As noted before, ODA-funded projects have traditionally been directed towards
  costly infrastructure projects, which may be maladaptive. This suggests that
  the principal financial barrier to technology transfer for coastal adaptation
  is not a shortage of funds, but the preference of donors as well as recipients
  to underwrite projects involving hard technologies developed in industrialised
  countries. Financial means for coastal adaptation to climate change have been
  limited thus far. For example, the GEF has only funded activities to plan for
  adaptation (i.e., information development), rather than supporting actual adaptation
  activities. Two successful GEF-funded projects to help Pacific and Caribbean
  countries to plan adaptation to global climate change are the Pacific Islands
  Climate Change Assistance Programme (PICCAP) and the Caribbean Planning for
  Adaptation to Climate Change (CPACC). <a href="348.htm">Case Study 20</a> provides
  a summary of relevant technology-transfer issues in CPACC.</p>
<p>Barriers of distance and culture must be overcome in all international transactions.
  These difficulties are multiplied if markets, information sources and the means
  of matching potential partners are poorly developed.</p>
