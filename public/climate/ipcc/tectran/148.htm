<h1>7.7 Role of Community Groups in Technology Transfer<sup><small><a href="fn8.htm#5" onClick="showFootnote(8,5); return false;">5</a></small></sup>
</h1>
<p><i>Within Countries</i><br>
  Technology transfer strategies are recognising alternatives to the old paradigm
  that envisioned all change as being mandated by top-down directives. The pervasive
  influence of community programmes has been recognised; these programmes often
  involve a vibrant mix of stakeholders, representing international, national,
  regional, city and community organisations (See <a href="fig773.htm">Figure
  7.3</a>). With increasing frequency, programme responsibilities are being delegated
  by national governments to regional and local governments and community organisations.
  In Russia, for example, the 89 regional governments are moving toward a federal
  structure with a more flexible fiscal system that is more responsive to the
  country's changing needs (Wallich, 1994). In Columbia, municipalities are developing
  the capacity needed to take control of responsibilities formerly belonging to
  the national government (World Bank, 1995). The city of Curitba has </p>

<p>earned the nickname, &quot;Ecology Capital of Brazil&quot;, through its innovative
  public transportation system, garbage recycling programme, and large number
  of trees, parks and green spaces (Dobbs, 1995; Fiszbein, 1999). </p>
<p>Within this context, there is an increased recognition of the role of communities
  where citizens' organisations, such as villages, neighbourhoods, and grassroots
  organisations, are the initiators in defining the need for new technologies
  through a high degree of collective decision-making (See <a href="003.htm">Chapter
  1</a>). The development of the Jiko cookstove, mentioned above, is an example
  of a community-driven pathway (<a href="329.htm">Case Study 1</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter
  16</a>). Many other examples are reported in a growing Best Practices Database
  maintained by the Together Foundation, an NGO, and the United Nations Centre
  for Human Settlements (UNCHS)-Habitat (Together Foundation, 1999). </p>
<p>Some of these examples: </p>
<ul>
  <li> In Benavides, a small Argentine village north of Buenos Aires, a non-profit
    civic association created a 173-home neighbourhood at 40 per cent of the cost
    of private real estate developers; </li>
  <li> In El-Tadamon Village in upper Egypt, the inhabitants of two villages destroyed
    by floods-one Moslem and one Christian-were relocated into a new village on
    higher ground. The new inhabitants worked together to build 102 houses, using
    a new &quot;healthy house&quot; design, and a textile and handcraft; </li>
  <li> In Rajasthan, India, the Academy for a Better World, by the Brahman Kumaris,
    constructed a new village for 800 people on barren land. The complex is using
    renewable energy and recycling its water to reforest the adjoining land.</li>
</ul>
<p> An analysis by the Inter-American Development Bank of the role that community
  organisations have played in alleviating poverty throughout Latin American suggests
  that governments could recognise the potential of such organisations (Navarro,
  1994). The objective of most community-driven initiatives has been to alleviate
  poverty, which often includes improved housing. However, community leaders have
  also shown a sensitivity to environmental issues (Tietenberg and Wheeler, 1998).
  The community-driven pathway appears open to playing a larger role in the diffusion
  of ESTs. <br>
  <i><br>
  Among Countries</i><br>
  Government-to-government programmes can empower community-driven technology
  transfer in two ways. The first is by simply informing communities about what
  other communities have done and how they did it. NGOs, such as the Together
  Foundation, can provide this information exchange, as it does through its Best
  Practices Database. Through their support for the Together Foundation, the UNCHS-Habitat
  and the European Union make this information exchange possible (Together Foundation,
  1999). Other international NGOs also are recognizsing the potential of the community-driven
  pathway, such as the International Institute for Energy Conservation, Alliance
  to Save Energy, Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense Fund,
  and Habitat for Humanity. <br>
  <br>
  The second way to empower these community-based initiatives is to recognise
  their potential role in the design of international programmes. The multinational
  development banks and multilateral assistance agencies are starting to do this
  in many of their analyses (Bamberger and Aziz, 1993; World Bank, 1994, 1995;
  Fiszbein, 1999; Navarro, 1994). The challenge now is to work with developing
  and transitioning countries to incorporate these insights into their lending
  and technology assistance programmes. </p>
