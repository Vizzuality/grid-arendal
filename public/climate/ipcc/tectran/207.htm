<h1>Executive Summary </h1>
<p>Agriculture is a worldwide critical strategic resource expected to double its
  production in 30 years to feed the world. Yet, agriculture is most directly
  affected by climate change through increased variability as well as temperature
  and moisture changes. Agriculture's adaptation to climate change will require
  new genetic stocks, improved irrigation efficiency, improved nutrient use efficiency,
  and improved risk management and production management techniques. </p>
<p>Agriculture can contribute modestly to mitigation through carbon sequestration
  in soils and in other ways. Emissions from manure can be turned into methane
  (CH<span class="subscript">4</span>) fuel. Methane from ruminants can be reduced
  through straw ammoniation and increased feed efficiency, and methane from rice
  paddies can be mitigated. Better nutrient management can reduce emissions of
  nitrous oxide (NO<span class="subscript">x</span>).</p>
<p>Adaptation to uncertainty such as climate change requires assembling a diverse
  portfolio of technologies, and keeping the flexibility to transfer and adopt
  needed technology. However, small farms and related businesses are risk-averse.
  Lack of information, financial and human capital, and transportation; as well
  as temporary (land) tenure and unreliable equipment and supplies discourage
  transfer of technology. These hindrances can rarely be surmounted unless the
  transferred technology profitably has high chances of quickly solving an evident
  problem. </p>
<p>The effectiveness of technology transfer in the agricultural sector in the
  context of climate change response strategies would depend to a great extent
  on the suitability of transferred technologies to the socio-economic and cultural
  context of the recipients, considering development, equity, and sustainability
  issues. This is particularly relevant when applied to North-South technology
  transfers in this sector.</p>
<p>Governments can facilitate transfer with incentives by regulating and by improving
  institutions. For example, farmers need stronger incentives to adapt to a changing
  environment. However, if subsidies and distortions of markets make farmers less
  susceptible to fluctuations in yield and price, they will also tone down signals
  of climate change, and thus slowing technology transfer. For example, cereal
  prices have been almost exempt of the 5 to 6 times rise of prices for almost
  everything in the course of the 55 years post wartime period.</p>
<p>The success of a response to an actual climate demonstrates that necessary
  technology can be developed, transferred and adopted. A new rice variety was
  developed in Sierra Leone to exploit seasonal rain and require less pesticide.
  Once success of the variety became apparent, farmers themselves transferred
  it to others. This transfer demonstrates the success of a policy that responds
  to present need, concentrates researchers, devises cheap technology, and promptly
  benefits farmers.</p>
<p>Some technologies will not be so easily transferred. Irrigation, a pre-eminent
  adaptation to climate, costs millions and requires communities to take up unfamiliar
  crops and methods. Nations must deal with scarce water and environmental impacts,
  marshal capital to construct the dams and canals and assist in the marketing
  of new crops. On the other hand, new crops (e.g., oil seeds), may require new
  processing plants located near the production site, or else they require considerable
  transportation to existing processing plants. To facilitate the transfer, banks
  could extend credit to farmers and research and training could turn to irrigation
  design, new crops, water use efficiency and prevention of salinity. Only an
  integrated national effort that extends to the farm level succeeds.<br>
  <br>
  Centuries of experience, much of it governmental, have demonstrated the value
  of new plants and the useful genes of established ones. Breeding, testing and
  demonstrating in the diverse locales and climates where farmers must cope with
  drought, pests, and different lengths of season have had a high payoff and are
  essential for adaptation to climate change.</p>
<p>Trade free of barriers facilitates technology transfer. Trade has exploited
  comparative advantages among climates and will continue to do so if climate
  changes. Free movement of innovations, knowledge and trained work forceswill
  speed technology transfer. This was demonstrated in th past, during the Green
  Revolution which showed the power of free movement of money, technicians, genes
  and information. As governments and donors have economised, business has stepped
  forward in research and innovation, but merely focusing on profitable areas.
</p>
<p>Education lies at the heart of technological transfer. The public role in education
  is pre-eminent and must be supported. Policies of practical demonstration have
  proven the most helpful form of education. Private business can announce technology
  in advertisements or demonstrate it at fairs. Governments have a role in monitoring
  claims and educating broadly. For example, the &quot;training and visit&quot;
  transfer requires both training technicians and getting them into the field
  to educate farmers.</p>
<p>Although the transfer of new varieties proceeds quickly and easily, transferring
  systems of management requires persistence. For example, America established
  the Conservation Technology Information Center in 1982 to encourage conservation
  tillage. Great progress has been made, but after 17 years, adoption is still
  ongoing.</p>
<p>Uncertainties cloud the favourable outlook for the transfer of agricultural
  technology. Because people transfer technology most readily to solve a problem
  that is serious, certain and imminent, the uncertainty of climate change hinders
  transfer. When, for example, climatologists assessing the climate for the next
  few years cannot agree whether it will be wetter or drier, no farmer will pay
  to mitigate emissions or invest in irrigation or drainage.</p>
<p>The growing role of private business and intellectual property rights introduces
  unfamiliar rules. At the same time, slowing public research adds to the problem.
  While the annual financial growth of the up-to-now-successful international
  research establishment (CGIAR), which stimulated and initiated yearly crop yield
  increases and aided in outgrowing the additional demand by the rising world
  population, has fallen from 14% to near 0%, it has spread its activities over
  new areas. Growth of national establishments has also slowed. </p>
<p>Despite uncertainties, past successes, established by embattled researchers
  and trainers, and the incentive of feeding the world encourage hope. The aim
  is reliable and adequate agricultural growth with less emission and more storage
  of greenhouse gases (GHGs).</p>
