<h3>2.3.2 Core Technologies and Strategic Partnerships</h3>
<p>International collaboration in energy R&amp;D involving national governments,
  the private sector, and university research communities has been cited as important
  in creating energy technology options for the future and facilitating technology
  transfer (IEA, 1997, UNEP, 1998; see also <a href="055.htm">Section 4.3</a>,
  <a href="086.htm">4.12</a> and <a href="116.htm">5.6</a> on the role of technology
  partnerships). A survey of 50 energy research institutions conducted for the
  Climate Technology Initiative found that respondents typically conducted less
  than 25 per cent of their climate change relevant research under international
  collaborative arrangements. Such efforts were focused on the planning and research
  stages rather than on development and deployment of technologies, possibly because
  governments were the funding source. The study identified a lack of collaboration
  between OECD countries and countries in Asia and Africa as a gap worth bridging.
  Furthermore, a feasibility study conducted by the Republic of Korea as part
  of the work programme of the Commission on Sustainable Development (Chung, 1998
  and UNCSD, 1998) notes that there is little coordination of public R&amp;D policies
  and ODA policies in most donor governments, and that partnership arrangements
  could yield significant results.</p>
<p>Looking beyond the energy sector, UNCTAD (1998) notes that the number of strategic
  R&amp;D partnerships in core technologies, such as information technology and
  biotechnology, has also been rising steadily since 1990. Developing-country
  companies assumed a bigger role in strategic partnerships (three per cent in
  1989 to 13 per cent in 1995), suggesting that these companies may have attained
  sufficient technological sophistication and capacity to make them worth having
  as partners (UNCTAD, 1998). Additionally, the OECD notes that R&amp;D by foreign
  affiliates represented more than 12 per cent of total industrial R&amp;D spending
  of the 15 OECD countries that account for 95 per cent of industrial R&amp;D
  undertaken by Member countries (OECD, 1998b). Most of this, however, occurs
  in a few industrial sectors, among them the computer, pharmaceuticals, electronics,
  chemicals, and car industries. Parent companies often enter into contracts with
  their affiliates to carry out specific research, and vice versa. Public financing
  of the R&amp;D of foreign affiliates is minimal in part because &quot;restrictions
  remain on foreign participation in government-funded R&amp;D and technology
  programmes&quot; (OECD, 1999b).</p>
