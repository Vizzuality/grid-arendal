<h1>Executive Summary </h1>
<p>In the forestry sector technology transfer has a broad definition, which includes
  sustainable forest management practices, forest conservation and Protected Area
  management systems, silvicultural practices for afforestation and reforestation
  programmes, genetically superior planting material, efficient harvesting, processing,
  end-use technologies and indigenous knowledge of forest conservation. Some of
  the potential roles for Governments to promote environmentally sound technology
  (EST) transfer in the forestry sector are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li> In the forestry sector, governments could provide targeted financial and
    technical support through multilateral agencies (such as GEF, World Bank,
    FAO, UNDP, UNEP), CGIAR institutions (such as CIFOR, ICRAF) and ODA for: capacity
    building (institutional and human), to adopt sustainable forest management
    practices, forest certification, reduced impact logging practices, high yielding
    silvicultural practices, bioenergy technologies, and forest area and status
    monitoring techniques, and so on.</li>
  <li> Governments could play a critical role in developing and enforcing the
    regulations to adopt sustainable forest management, timber certification,
    recycling, reduced impact logging practices, etc. through financial incentives
    and regulatory measures.</li>
  <li> Governments could promote the participation of communities, institutions
    and NGOs in implementing forestry projects and in enforcing regulations.</li>
  <li> The forestry sector is highly regulated in many regions and Governments
    could create conditions to enable participation of industry and farmers --
    with adequate guidelines to ensure biodiversity conservation and interests
    of local communities, and to enable the private sector to have an increasing
    role in developing and transferring technologies through commercial mechanisms
    between countries. Relaxing government ownership and control to include private
    and community ownership and mid-term to long-term leasing may enhance technology
    transfer.</li>
  <li> One of the most important approaches that governments along with multilateral
    agencies can do to promote forestry mitigation technologies and projects is
    to develop and transfer methodologies for monitoring, measuring and verifying
    carbon mitigation and forest area changes to enhance the credibility of forestry
    mitigation projects. </li>
  <li> The governments and private sector in Annex I and non-Annex I countries,
    as well as multilateral agencies, have a critical role in establishing and
    operationalising financial and regulatory mechanisms, monitoring, verification
    and certification arrangements, and capacity building for technology development,
    transfer and assimilation. Governments could prepare guidelines and set up
    institutional mechanisms to process, evaluate, sanction, and monitor forest-sector
    mitigation and adaptation projects.</li>
  <li> The role of private sector funding of projects needs to be promoted under
    the new initiatives, including the proposed flexible mechanisms under the
    Kyoto Protocol. GEF could fund projects that actively promote technology transfer
    and capacity building in addition to the mitigation aspects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Appropriately designed forestry mitigation and adaptation projects contribute
  to other environmental impacts as biodiversity conservation, watershed protection,
  and socio-economic benefits to urban and rural populations through access to
  forest products and creation of jobs, especially in rural areas ultimately promoting
  sustainable development. </p>
