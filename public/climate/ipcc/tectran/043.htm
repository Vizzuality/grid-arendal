<h3>3.4.2 Technology Transfer in the Kyoto Protocol and Buenos Aires Decisions
</h3>
<p>The wording on technology transfer in the Kyoto Protocol, compared to the UNFCCC,
  does lay greater emphasis upon the role of private investment and of actions
  by and in the developing countries themselves. The opening sentence in Article
  10(c) of the Kyoto Protocol states that Parties should &quot;Cooperate in ..&quot;
  contrasts with the Convention's onus upon developed country Parties only to
  &quot;take all practicable steps&quot;. It also expands on similar language
  in the Convention by adding the general catch-all on &quot;practices and processes
  pertinent to climate change&quot;. Perhaps most significantly, it formally recognises
  the role of the private sector and the need for an &quot;enabling environment.&quot;
  All this reflects a significant evolution of thinking, but is very limited in
  terms of specific commitments (see <a href="043.htm#b35">Box 3.5</a>).</p>

      countries, including the formulation of policies and programmes for the
      effective transfer of environmentally sound technologies that are publicly

      for the private sector, to promote and enhance access to, and transfer of,
      environmentally sound technologies;</i></td>

<p>In some ways, concerning technology transfer itself, the CoP4 follow-up in
  Buenos Aires was perhaps more significant than the Protocol itself. There was
  a much more focussed agreement that addressed the roles of all Parties. It called
  for Annex II Parties (largely OECD countries) to provide lists of environmentally
  sound technologies that were publicly owned, and for developing countries to
  submit prioritised technology needs, especially related to key technologies
  for addressing climate change. All Parties were urged to create an enabling
  environment to stimulate private sector investment, and to identify projects
  and programmes on cooperative approaches to technology transfer. Most importantly,
  the agreement called for a consultative process to be established to consider
  a list of 19 specific issues and associated questions, set out in an Annex (referred
  to in <a href="003.htm">Chapter 1</a>). One interpretation is that the Kyoto
  and subsequent Buenos Aires agreements on technology transfer 'embodied a considerable
  change of attitude in which the previous impasse has eased in favour of an approach
  which recognises that there are real problems that require real creative solutions
  to achieve global dissemination of environmentally sustainable technologies'
  (Grubb<i> et al</i>., 1999). </p>
