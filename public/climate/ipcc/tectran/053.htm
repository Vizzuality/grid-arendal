<h1>4.1 Introduction </h1>
<p>As discussed in <a href="017.htm">Chapter 2</a>, international financial flows
  have strongly influenced technology transfers between countries. Since UNCED
  in 1992, three major trends in finance for sustainable development have occurred.
  First, there has been increasing interest and activity in developing innovative
  domestic and international financial mechanisms. Second, both official development
  assistance and domestic resource mobilisation have fallen short of the commitments
  made. Third, private flows of financial resources from developed to developing
  countries have expanded enormously (Lin See Yan, 1997). </p>
<p>To improve the quality and efficacy of the transfer of environmentally sound
  technologies for the purposes of the UNFCCC, these trends need to be set in
  a broader context. That context-for promoting successful, sustainable technology
  transfer-implies multi-facetted enabling environments in both developed and
  developing countries. Enabling environments for technology transfer include
  national institutions for technology innovation, the involvement of social organisations,
  human and institutional capacities for selecting and managing technologies,
  macroeconomic policy frameworks, the underpinnings of sustainable markets for
  environmentally sound technologies, national legal institutions that reduce
  risk and protect intellectual property rights, codes and standards, research
  and technology development, and the means for addressing equity issues and respecting
  existing property rights. Enabling environments are inclusive, with all stakeholders
  potentially affected - governments, research institutions, national NGOs, technology
  developers and businesses. And actions to promote enabling environments are
  required in both developed and developing countries.</p>
<p>Any discussion of enabling environments inevitably conjures up the long-standing
  debate about &quot;good government.&quot; Good government has been increasingly
  recognised as essential for promoting the environment and development agenda.
  Yet sharp disagreements have existed about what good government means; a wide
  range of actions have taken place in response to &quot;simultaneously too much
  state and too little state&quot; (Merquior, 1993). In both developed and developing
  countries in the 1980s and early 1990s, many governments committed themselves
  to market-oriented approaches for generating economic growth as a response to
  &quot;too much state.&quot; Economic and political pressure forced governments
  to limit or eliminate economic interventions. This response to decades of &quot;too
  much state&quot; reduced the size, expenditures, and responsibilities of public
  sectors (Grindle, 1997). Reform priorities turned to the stabilisation of macroeconomic
  conditions, liberalisation of domestic and international trade, privatisation,
  and the reduction of state bureaucracies. </p>
<p>Over time it became clear to many that government also had to be strengthened
  to make it efficient, effective and responsive. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The most significant obstacle to the pursuit of social objectives is what
    may be described as the crisis of governance. The crisis of governance includes
    an excessive degree of centralisation; overburdening and rigidity of the government
    machinery; the absence of local participation which can provide the requisite
    attention to detail; deterioration in the professionalism, competence and
    integrity of public functionaries and the weakening of judicial and quasi-judicial
    institutions (Banuri et al., 1997, p. 9). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Governments not only had to have the capacity to manage macroeconomic policy
  but also had to be able to actively regulate market behaviour. So the trend
  towards market-oriented economic policy inevitably led to new (or rediscovered)
  roles for the state (Naim, 1995). In addition, reformers began to recognise
  that well-defined and functioning institutions of governance were important
  for the stability and legitimacy of new modes of public and community participation.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>By the mid 1990s, good government had been added to the development agenda
    precisely because of greater awareness that neither markets nor democracies
    could function well--or perhaps function at all--unless governments were able
    to design and implement appropriate public policies, administer resources
    equitably, transparently and efficiently, and respond to the social welfare
    and economic claims of citizens. Although a general consensus developed on
    the imperative for good government, how to get good government has not been
    clearly understood (Grindle, 1997, p. 5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Past experience with technology transfer in a variety of sectors can be used
  to suggest policy tools for providing enabling environments for the transfer
  of technologies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change that is supportive
  and sustainable. Evidence exists both of barriers and ways in which barriers
  can be avoided and overcome. Experience also shows that technology transfer
  offers many opportunities for sustainable economic and social development. Perceptions
  of the role of technology transfer in development have been transformed in the
  past twenty years, as the focus has switched from externally supplied hardware
  to people, processes, and the importance of local knowledge. Experience also
  has shown that technology transfer can be made more sustainable by ensuring
  that long-term learning and adaptation takes place, that conditions for market
  sustainability exist, that stakeholders continue to be involved, and that replicable
  financing mechanisms continue to function.</p>
<p>The sustainable use of environmentally sound technologies (ESTs) for climate
  change has to fulfill not only social but also economic and development objectives
  through a complex process of technological change. <a href="051.htm">Chapters
  4</a> and <a href="092.htm">5</a> explore what enabling conditions government
  can establish to facilitate this change in support of the Climate Change Convention,
  and how other stakeholders in the private sector, lending institutions, multilateral
  agencies, and non-governmental organisations can perform within this framework.
  This chapter identifies the key elements and broad relationships and <a href="092.htm">Chapter
  5</a> focuses on the crucial financial partnerships needed.</p>
