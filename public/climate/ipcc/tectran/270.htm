<h1>Executive Summary </h1>
<p>Climate change is anticipated to have wide-ranging consequences for human population
  health. Public health depends particularly on sufficiency of food, safe drinking
  water, secure community settlement and family shelter, and the environmental
  and social control of various infectious diseases. These health determinants
  can be affected by climate. Technological actions taken to reduce greenhouse
  gas (GHG) emissions or to reduce the health (or other) impacts of climate change
  can themselves affect population health. Therefore, the evaluation and full-cost
  accounting of technologies introduced to mitigate climate change must include
  an assessment of the health impacts of those technologies. </p>
<p>The uncertainty about future local and regional health impacts of climate change
  means that intervention strategies that also produce current public health benefit
  are more acceptable. For example, reductions in fossil fuel combustion and changes
  in transport policy have the potential to achieve prompt reductions in mortality
  and morbidity. Since these &quot;secondary&quot; health benefits of mitigation
  occur primarily within local populations, Clean Development Mechanism projects
  that entail bilateral investment in GHG mitigation strategies can achieve immediate
  and substantial health gains in low-income countries.</p>
<p>A population's vulnerability to adverse health impacts of climate change is
  usually amplified by socio-economic deprivation. Social policies that reduce
  socio-economic and environmental vulnerability will therefore mitigate the effects
  of climate change. Maintaining and strengthening national public health infrastructure
  is therefore fundamental to effective adaptation to climate change. Adaptation
  strategies should be undertaken principally via public agencies. To facilitate
  the process, the public policies and institutional arrangements that currently
  impede adaptation to environmental conditions should be identified.</p>
<p>Both the existing and the future-potential environmental health problems share
  many underlying causes, relating to poverty, inequality and social and economic
  practices. Reducing levels of resource consumption in Annex I countries and
  slowing down population growth in other countries will help to mitigate greenhouse
  gas emissions and their consequent climate-mediated health impacts, while also
  bringing early public health benefits. The protection and improvement of population
  health must be recognised as a central goal of environmentally sustainable development.</p>
