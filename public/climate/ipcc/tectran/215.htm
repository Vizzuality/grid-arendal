<h1>11.3 Magnitude of Current and Future Technology Transfer</h1>
<h3>11.3.1 Global System for Agricultural Technology Transfer Already in Place</h3>
<p>The agricultural sector is unique in that a global network of research, development
  and technology transfer has already been in place for a number of decades. Before
  World War II, little cooperation existed between countries in agricultural research
  or technology transfer. Most countries developed agricultural technologies in
  relative isolation. That is no longer the case. Today major elements of what
  can be described as a global agricultural research system are in place, where
  any country can link its research efforts to the international system to help
  solve important problems.</p>
<p>The global system is made up of three major players: NARSs (National Agricultural
  Research Systems) of developing countries, IARCs (International Agricultural
  Research Centers), and advanced laboratories and institutions in developed countries.
  These players interact in a variety of ways, including bilateral agreements,
  multilateral agreements, contracts, and research networks. The global system,
  being informal, depends largely on the meshing of perceived needs of numerous
  research organisations. With its growth and development, it has become the world's
  largest and most collaborative scientific enterprise. Almost every country is
  involved in some way and has invested some of its own funds, mostly at home,
  to participate. The community-driven technology transfers often proceed in the
  system.</p>
<p>Since the 1960s the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research
  (CGIAR) has established 16 IARCs. The initial centres focused their research
  on the major food crops grown in developing countries - rice, wheat, maize,
  potatoes and cassava. These were joined in the 1970s by centres focussing on
  livestock production, animal disease and genetic resources, on arid and semiarid
  areas, food policy and the capacity of the national research system. During
  1990 to 1992, five new centres were added to the CGIAR system, focussing on
  areas such as irrigation management, agro-forestry and aquatic research. This
  expansion was not accompanied by an expansion of the resources available to
  the system. In contrast with expanded missions and increasing worldwide demand
  for agricultural technology, support for the CGIAR system has actually declined
  in real terms. </p>
