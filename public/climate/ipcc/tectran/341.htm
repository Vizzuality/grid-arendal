  <b>Summary</b><br>
  This case study, for the energy sector, highlights the technology cooperation 
  between Arun Natural Gas Field (northern Sumatra), Mobil Oil Corporation, and 
  Pertamina, the Indonesian national oil company. The natural gas is produced, 
  liquefied, and shipped to Japan and Korea for use in power plants, displacing 
  the alternative use of coal or heavy oil. Mobil has utilised the best available 
  technology and upgrades it continuously. The development of Arun Natural Gas 
  Field is an example of both technology transfer and capacity building. The project 
  has the potential for replication under similar operations worldwide.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Background</b><br>
  In 1971, Mobil discovered the Arun Natural Gas Field in rural Indonesia. This 
  is one of the biggest and most important finds both for Indonesia and Mobil. 
  The Operation at the Arun Field was the processing of liquefied natural gas 
  (LNG) for exportation to Japan and Korea as well as for use in Indonesia. The 
  Arun Field was located in a rural area that lacked industrial infrastructure. 
  There was no competent work force available to operate. The project not only 
  had to provide that infrastructure, but it also had to provide a competent indigenous 
  workforce to operate these facilities. The project also faced political and 
  cultural barriers. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Approach</b><br>
  The project is a cooperative effort between Mobil Oil Corporation and Pertamina, 
  the Indonesian national oil company. Mobile Oil Indonesia (MOI) was incorporated 
  as a production-sharing contractor for Pertamina in 1967. Although the development 
  of Arun Gas Field and its associated P.T. Arun LNG plant required a significant 
  financial investment, its operating costs were relatively low and its profitability 
  high. Hence, it was considered a low finance risk for MOI. <br>
  <br>
  Mobil encouraged Indonesian participation through training and capacity building. 
  In 1998, 96% of MOI's more than 1,100 employees were Indonesian. At the P.T. 
  Arun LNG plant, only twelve of the nearly 1,750 employees were non-Indonesian. 
  To achieve this high rate of Indonesian participation in the workforce, Mobil 
  conducted an extensive series of training courses. In 1993, Mobil expanded its 
  training effort to Pertamina to train 100 Pertamina professionals over a two-year 
  period in the latest environmental, health and safety technology. <br>
  <b><br>
  Impacts</b><br>
  Since the first deliveries of Arun in 1977, the growth in sales from Arun has 
  been quite remarkable. In addition to long LNG sales contracts with Japan and 
  Korea, Pertamina has been able to provide incremental cargoes of LNG from Arun 
  to satisfy additional short-term market demands. Both Indonesia and Mobil continue 
  to share significant economic benefits from this operation. The gas produced 
  at Arun has opened the way for new commercial activities in North Sumatra, thus 
  helping to build a strong local economy.<br>
  <br>
  At Arun, there were five discrete areas and four hydrocarbon producing clusters. 
  This cluster approach had minimised the use of cultivated land, centralised 
  process equipment and reduced the distance that high-pressure gas had to be 
  transported. The field also supplied gas to two fertiliser plants and a local 
  paper mill, creating additional job opportunities. The success at Arun is due 
  to a very competent Indonesian workforce and the application of technology improvements 
  to increase the plant throughput and field production, providing for the continued 
  growth in LNG and gas liquids sales. <br>
  <br>
  The project provided significant economic benefits both to Indonesia and Mobil. 
  The continued operation demonstrates the success of technical cooperation for 
  environmental issues. <br>
  <br>
  In addition, the technology transfer and capacity building have made a significant 
  contribution to the people of Indonesia. Mobil assisted the development of the 
  country's infrastructure and workforce. In other local projects, Mobil had drilled 
  water wells, built and repaired roads and bridges, and assisted in the construction 
  of schools and mosques <br>
  <b><br>
  Lessons Learned</b><br>
  Gas development at Arun has been a success both technically and economically. 
  This success can be attributed to several factors, the most pertinent of which 
  is the close working partnership between Pertamina, the LNG buyers and the production 
  sharing contractor, Mobil. The mutual commitment assuring the best technology 
  and a competent workforce was the key to the success of this operation.<br>
