<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>
  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly established
  by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment
  Programme (UNEP) to asses available information on the science, impacts and
  the economics of climate change and of mitigation options to address it. It
  provides also, on request, scientific/technical/ socio-economic advice to the
  Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on
  Climate Change (UNFCCC). Since its inception the IPCC has produced a series
  of Assessment Reports, Special Reports, Technical Papers, methodologies and
  other products which have become standard works of reference, widely used by
  policymakers, scientists and other experts.</p>
<p> This Special Report has been prepared by IPCC Working Group III in response
  to a request by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice
  (SBSTA) to the UNFCC. Innovation and enhanced efforts to transfer environmentally
  sound tech-nology to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to climate
  change will be required to meet the objective of the Climate Convention and
  to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts. The report addresses the
  technology transfer problem in the con-text of climate change while emphasizing
  the sustainable devel-opment perspective. Technology transfer is defined as
  the broad set of processes covering the flows of know-how, experience and equipment
  and is the result of many day-to-day decisions of the different stakeholders
  involved. A number of social, economic, political, legal, and technological
  factors influence the flow and quality of technology transfer. Essential elements
  of successful transfers include consumer and business awareness, access to information,
  availability of a wide range of technical, business, management and regulatory
  skills locally, and sound economic policy and regulatory frameworks. Technology
  transfers that meet local needs and priorities are more likely to be successful.
  But there is no pre-set answer to enhancing technology transfer. Interactions
  and barriers vary according to sector, type of tech-nology and country, and
  recent trends in international financial flows that drive technology transfer
  are altering the relative capacities and roles of different stakeholders. Policy
  actions therefore need to be tailored to the specific context and interests.
  The report elaborates on what governments can do to facilitate and enhance the
  transfer of Environmentally Sound Technologies, but it also aims at reaching
  decision makers in the private sector, lending institutions, multilateral agencies,
  non-governmental organizations, and the interested public.</p>
<p> As usual in the IPCC, success in producing this report has depend-ed first
  and foremost on the enthusiasm and cooperation of sci-entists and other experts
  worldwide. These individuals have devoted enormous time and effort to producing
  this report and we are extremely grateful for their commitment to the IPCC process.</p>
<p> We would like to express our sincere thanks to:</p>
