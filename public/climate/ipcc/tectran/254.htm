<h1>Executive Summary </h1>
<p>Methane is generated from solid waste and wastewater through anaerobic decomposition.
  Together, solid waste and wastewater disposal and treatment represent about
  20 per cent of human-induced methane emissions. Emissions are expected to grow
  in the future, with the largest increases coming from developing countries.</p>
<p>Methane emissions can be reduced in many ways, including reducing waste generation
  (source reduction), diverting waste away from disposal sites (i.e., through
  composting, recycling, or incineration), recovering methane generated from the
  waste, or ensuring that waste does not decompose in an anaerobic environment.
  In general, any technique or technology that reduces methane generation or converts
  methane into carbon dioxide through combustion will reduce greenhouse gases
  (GHGs). The most effective mitigation approaches are those that either reduce
  overall methane generation (because methane collection efficiencies rarely approach
  100%) or ensure that the combusted methane is substituted for fossil-based energy.</p>
<p>Extensive technology transfer aimed at improving waste management is underway
  both within and between countries, although most activities have been, and will
  likely continue to be, domestic in nature. In many regions, large investments
  are still required to provide adequate waste management services. In the past,
  the climate-related impacts of waste management choices were not routinely considered.
  Mitigation technologies can be readily deployed in this sector, however, and
  provide benefits beyond the reduction of GHG emissions, such as reduced landfill
  space requirements or additional energy generation through methane recovery.</p>
<p>Technology transfer in the waste management sector occurs predominately along
  government driven pathways, with several levels of government (from the national
  to the municipal level), participating. Key government priorities are establishing
  appropriate policy/regulatory frameworks, supporting the expansion of private
  sector participation, participating in technical assistance and capacity building
  activities, particularly with community groups, and in some cases providing
  incentives to catalyze desirable actions. This is discussed in more detail in
  <a href="095.htm">Section 5.2</a>.</p>
<p>Historically, the private sector (including both domestic and multinational
  companies, as well as more informal local enterprises) and community-based organisations
  have been somewhat limited participants in government-driven technology transfer.
  The private sector has an increasingly important role, however, because meeting
  future waste management needs depends on expanded private investment. Private
  sector driven pathways are already used routinely for some types of investments
  (such as methane recovery at landfills), and efforts are underway to expand
  private sector participation across the full range of waste management services
  and technologies. The involvement of community organisations is also increasing
  as the link between community support and project sustainability has become
  clear. Soliciting local input and providing local training are two ways of ensuring
  sustainability. In many areas, locally developed and implemented projects are
  also being used to quickly address serious local concerns.</p>
<p>This review of the waste management sector reveals several key findings. This
  sector can contribute to greenhouse gas mitigation in ways that are economically
  viable and meet many social priorities. Already, extensive technology transfer
  is underway, and it will continue due to the continuing need to provide and
  improve waste management services for the world's population. In the past, the
  government driven pathway has dominated this sector, and it will likely dominate
  in the future as well. However, additional levels of government are becoming
  involved, as national government agencies devolve responsibilities for waste
  management to regional and municipal agencies. Private sector and community
  driven pathways are also becoming more important in this sector. Regardless
  of the pathway, it is important that projects emphasise the deployment of locally
  appropriate technologies, and minimise the development of conventional large,
  integrated waste management systems (with their attendant financial, institutional
  and technical requirements) in situations where lower cost, simpler alternative
  waste management technologies can be used. </p>
