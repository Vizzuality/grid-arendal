<h1>1.6 The Innovation System and Pathways: A Framework for Analysis </h1>

  </tr>

<p>The theme of technology transfer is highly interdisciplinary and has been approached
  from a variety of perspectives, including: business, law, finance, microeconomics,
  international trade, international political economy, the environment, geography,
  anthropology, education, communication, and labour studies. Although there are
  numerous frameworks and models put forth to cover different aspects of technology
  transfer, there are no corresponding overarching theories (Martinot et al.,
  1997; Reddy and Zhao, 1990). This Report employs the technology transfer/innovation
  system as a framework for analysis. In this system (see <a href="fig111.htm">Figure 1.1</a>),
  technology is transferred as knowledge, money (investment)
  and goods (trade) flow among different stakeholders: governments, private-sector
  entities, financial institutions, non-governmental organisations, and research/teaching
  institutions. Innovation performance depends on the way in which the different
  stakeholders of the &quot;innovation system&quot; - businesses, universities
  and other research bodies - interact with one another at the local, national
  and international levels. It also depends on the innovation promotion policies
  of governments.</p>
<p>There are a large number of pathways through which the various stakeholders
  can interact to transfer technologies. The most common include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>direct purchases</li>
  <li> licensing</li>
  <li> franchising</li>
  <li> foreign direct investment</li>
  <li> sale of turn-key plants</li>
  <li> joint ventures</li>
  <li> subcontracting</li>
  <li> cooperative research arrangements and co-production agreements</li>
  <li> export of products and capital goods</li>
  <li> exchange of scientific and technical personnel</li>
  <li> science and technology conferences, trade shows and exhibits</li>
  <li> education and training (of nationals and foreigners)</li>
  <li> commercial visits</li>
  <li> open literature (journals, magazines, books, and articles)</li>
  <li> government assistance programmes.</li>
</ul>
<p> Other pathways require little or no interaction among the principal stakeholders,
  because they involve the acquisition of technology without the consent of the
  provider. Among these are:</p>
<ol>
  <li> industrial espionage</li>
  <li> end-user or third country diversions</li>
  <li> reverse engineering.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each pathway represents different types of flows of knowledge, money, goods
  and services among different sets of stakeholders (see also <a href="016.htm">Annex 1-3</a>). Each
  pathway has very different implications for the learning that occurs and ultimately
  the degree of technology-as-knowledge transfer that takes place beyond simple
  hardware transfers.</p>
<p>The following framework classifies pathways into three primary types: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Government-driven pathways are technology transfers initiated by government
    to fulfil specific policy objectives;</li>
  <li> Private-sector-driven pathways primarily involve transfers between commercially
    oriented private-sector entities, and have become the dominant mode of technology
    transfer;</li>
  <li> Community-driven pathways are those technology transfers involving community
    organisations with a high degree of collective decision-making. </li>
</ol>

<p>Some observers have suggested that along any pathway, technology transfer follows
  five &quot;stages&quot;: assessment (including identification of needs), agreement,
  implementation, evaluation and adjustment, and replication (<a href="fig112.htm">Figure 1.2</a>). The
  stakeholders involved and the specific decisions and actions taken at each stage
  differ greatly depending upon the pathway. By analysing the interests and influences
  of different stakeholders at each stage it is possible to determine how various
  barriers to technology transfer might be overcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much has been written about why multinational corporations choose one pathway
  over another. Some of the key issues are summarised in <a href="009.htm#t12">Table 1.2</a>. While wholly
  owned subsidiaries have been the dominant modes of foreign direct investment
  (except where joint ventures have been specifically targeted by national policies,
  such as in India), international joint ventures have been growing in number
  since the 1980s. Various theories have been advanced to explain this change.
  Datta (1988) suggests that: (a) host governments are increasingly requiring
  foreign investors to form joint ventures, (b) multinational corporations have
  realised that the knowledge of complex and often volatile local business environments
  by local partners can be a significant asset, and (c) there is a growing trend
  to internationalise business to reduce costs. Contractor (1991) sees transaction
  costs as determinants of a firm's choice of the mode of transfer. Kogut (1988)
  explains joint ventures in terms of transaction costs, strategic behaviour,
  and transfer of organisational knowledge and learning. Kogut further suggests
  that some forms of tacit knowledge can only be transferred through a joint venture,
  because the knowledge is organisationally embedded and not conducive to licensing
  or other forms of transfer. On the other hand, increasing global competition
  may deter technology transfer, especially at the cutting edge.</p>
