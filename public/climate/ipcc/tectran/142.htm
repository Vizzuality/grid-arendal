<h3>7.5.6 Research, Development and Demonstration</h3>
<p><i>Within Countries</i><br>
  Government and private sector research programmes play a critical role by developing
  and demonstrating advanced technologies that meet human needs more effectively,
  at lower costs and with fewer adverse environmental impacts. The technologies
  that are making a difference now are the results of past research. While this
  Report focuses on existing and near-term technologies, it is important to recognise
  the role that today's RD&amp;D programmes will have in developing the ESTs for
  the technology transfer programmes of the future. </p>
<p>For example, the U.S. Department of Energy played a key RD&amp;D role in the
  introduction--among other new products--of low-emissivity windows, electronic
  ballasts, and high efficiency supermarket refrigeration systems. These three
  technologies, alone, have provided U.S. manufacturers with US$3.5 billion in
  cumulative sales and are delivering 250 Tbtu (264x1015 J) /yr of primary energy
  savings worth US$1.5 billion a year (Alliance to Save Energy, 1997).</p>
<p>Although not often recognised, a high degree of scientific skill is also required
  to develop improved products in developing countries, such as the Jiko cookstove
  in Kenya (See <a href="329.htm">Case Study 1</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter
  16</a>). In sub-Saharan Africa, where household cooking accounts for more than
  60 per cent of total energy use in some countries, this is a high priority.
  Inefficient combustion of traditional fuels has also resulted in high concentrations
  of pollutants and acute respiratory infections. For 20 years, international
  aid organisations have tried to develop improved cookstoves, but have encountered
  a complex tangle of combustion, convection, conduction, cost, and acceptance
  problems. The Jiko cookstove is a collaboration between scientists, local craftspeople,
  and potential users. Today, hundreds of local craftspeople manufacture some
  20,000 stoves a month and more than 1 million are in use throughout Kenya. Each
  stove cost roughly US$2 , uses 1,300 pounds less fuel per month, and saves urban
  households as much as US$65 a year (one-fifth of the average annual income)
  (Kammen and Dove, 1997). Another example is in Senegal where the butane cookstove
  was re-engineered to meet local conditions (See <a href="335.htm">Case Study
  7</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>). </p>
<p>The demonstration component of RD&amp;D can be important in countries with
  little experience in the application of technologies used elsewhere. This is
  the situation in Russia and other transition countries with limited experience
  in modern space heating technologies. Space and hot water heating dominate the
  energy use of the building sector in Russia, accounting for two-thirds to three-fourths
  of total residential energy consumption. Most of the space heating is provided
  to multifamily buildings supplied by district heating systems. The buildings
  suffer from high energy losses due to heating intensities--the energy required
  for indoor comfort adjusted to different climate conditions--that are one to
  two times higher than in Western countries (Martinot, 1997). In typical apartment
  units, if households paid the actual cost of the space heat and hot water they
  receive, this would represent 40% of their monthly wages. National and municipal
  governments face the challenge of addressing this problem, which requires a
  combination of technical, financial, institutional and social measures. The
  challenges include forming homeowners associations, developing consumption-based
  metering, creating utility regulations that encourage energy efficiency investments,
  providing long-term financing, and increasing the number and capabilities of
  local design and construction firms.</p>
<p><i>Among Countries</i><br>
  Research activities among countries fall into two categories. The first area
  is multilateral and bilateral RD&amp;D programmes that can give countries access
  to research advances at a lower cost than through separate national programmes
  and enlarges the pool of researchers, which can lead to more creative approaches
  and more significant results. An example is the collaborative energy RD&amp;D
  programme of the International Energy Agency.</p>
<p>A second area is adaptive RD&amp;D, which examines how the advances in one
  country might be adapted to the needs of another. For example, the RD&amp;D
  in a developed country might lead to the commercial introduction of a highly
  efficient 20-cubic-foot refrigerator. In other countries, there may be little
  interest in such a refrigerator. However, the technologies embedded in the refrigerator--the
  advanced insulation, seals, compressor, and controls--may be adapted to different
  refrigerator models for a wide variety of different international markets.</p>
