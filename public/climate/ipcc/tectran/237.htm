<h3>12.3.4 Generic Barriers to Technology Transfer</h3>
<p>The current and emerging pathways and mechanisms have several limitations to
  promote climate mitigation technologies, namely, (i) limited financial resources,
  (ii) inadequate information on the costs and potential benefits, (iii) limited
  technical capacity, (iii) absence of policies and institutions to process, evaluate
  and clear mitigation projects, (iv) uncertainty regarding quantity of carbon
  abated and its permanence, (v) a longer period to realise carbon benefits (eg.
  hardwood timber plantations), (vi) low economic returns for some technologies,
  and (vii) absence of consideration of the economic value of environmental benefits.
  In addition, the forestry sector faces land use regulation and other macroeconomic
  policies that usually favour conversion to other land uses such as agriculture
  and cattle ranching. Insecure land tenure regimes and tenure rights, and subsidies
  favouring agriculture or livestock are among the most important barriers for
  ensuring sustainable management of forests as well as sustainability of C abatement.</p>
<p>In many tropical countries, the national and state forest departments play
  a predominant role in all aspects of forest protection, regeneration and management.
  Currently lack of funding and technical capabilities in most tropical countries
  limit generation of information required for planning and implementation of
  forestry mitigation projects. Apart from a few exceptions, developing countries
  do not have adequate capacity to participate in international research projects,
  and to adapt and transfer results of the research to the local level. Research
  on forests has not only suffered from a lack of resources; it has not been sufficiently
  interdisciplinary to provide an integrated view of forestry (FAO, 1997). However,
  the majority of the forestry research institutions in developing countries do
  not function as R&amp;D laboratories on the patterns of research institutions
  in industrialised countries. Unlike in the energy or transportation sectors,
  the technologies or even the management systems are going to be forest type
  or country specific. Complimentary to R&amp;D activities of research institutes,
  special information transfer and extension services are desirable.</p>
<p>Forestry-sector GHG mitigation activities and joint implementation projects
  generally face a wide range of technical issues that challenge their credibility.
  The twin objectives of using forestry to mitigate climate change and managing
  forests sustainably do pose a challenge in monitoring and verifying benefits
  from carbon offset projects in the sector (Andrasko, 1997). The emergence of
  improved monitoring methods could force reappraisal of the relative credibility
  of activities to manage carbon sinks. Monitoring and verification are key elements
  in gaining the credibility needed to capture the potential benefits of forestry
  sector response options, particularly in reducing deforestation (Fearnside,
  1997). While this is a generic barrier to deforestation reduction initiatives,
  it also represents an opportunity for transferring the technologies needed to
  monitor land-use change, and carbon stocks and flows. Among the mitigation options,
  there is quite a high degree of certainty about reforestation/afforestation,
  less on forest management and even less on forest conservation. </p>
