<h3>3.3.3 The Montreal Protocol </h3>
<p>The Montreal Protocol (MP) on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is one
  of the more successful amongst international treaties related to global environmental
  problems (see also <a href="115.htm">Section 5.5.7</a> in <a href="092.htm">Chapter
  5</a>). It provides a good example of an international agreement that has been
  continuously amended in response to new scientific and technical assessments.
</p>
<p>Signed by only 24 (mostly developed) countries in 1987, it has grown to almost
  global participation, thanks to a judicious combination of trade measures, with
  positive measures of financial and technology transfer provisions (Vossenaar
  and Jha, 1998). The overall commitments acquired by the international community
  to phase out ozone depleting substances (ODS) sent a &quot;strong signal&quot;
  to governments and enterprises to take actions to lower production and consumption
  of these chemicals and to search for adequate substitutes. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the initial reduction schedules were agreed to before adequate
  substitutes were in the marketplace. Therefore, the MP could be seen as speeding
  up the technological innovation and as a competitive process among leading enterprises.
  In this regard, the MP has created a broad range of business opportunities all
  around the world, and helped many developing countries create political and
  economic conditions that are more favourable to technology transfer. </p>
<p>However, the large scale of illegal trade in controlled chemicals to the US
  and the EU is an issue that threatens the Montreal Protocol achievements to
  protect the ozone layer (Environmental Investigation Agency, 1998). A number
  of authors have called for stronger intelligence and enforcement measures to
  prevent and eliminate smuggling of these substances. <br>
  <br>
  <i>The Multilateral Fund </i><br>
  The treaty established a Multilateral Fund (1998) to assist developing countries
  to comply with its commitments. Notwithstanding the fact that there are few
  formal technology transfer agreements under MP operations (as outlined in <a href="017.htm">Chapter
  2</a>, the Fund has been a key factor that has facilitated technology transfer
  to developing countries.</p>
<p>The Fund operates under the authority of the Parties that appointed an Executive
  Committee (ExCom) that has to &quot;develop and monitor the implementation of
  specific operational policies, guidelines and administrative arrangements, including
  the disbursement of resources, for the purpose of achieving the objectives of
  the Multilateral Fund (1998)&quot;. ExCom has 14 members divided equally between
  developed and developing countries, with annual renewal. The way that the ExCom
  works has allowed a wide participation of developing countries on an equitable
  basis, encouraging adoption of balanced decisions on many controversial and
  difficult issues. The practical operation and disbursement of the Fund to date
  has been summarised in <a href="017.htm">Chapter 2</a> (<a href="023.htm#b21">Box
  2.1</a>). </p>
<p>The activities approved by the ExCom have helped developing countries in areas
  which can be called &quot;hard technology transfer&quot;, carried out mainly
  by the World Bank, UNDP and UNIDO, and &quot;soft technology transfer&quot;,
  directed mainly by UNEP. UNEP's activities provide various types of support
  including information exchange, networking, institutional strengthening, capacity-building
  and training (Shende &amp; Gorman, 1997). The World Bank, UNDP and UNIDO have
  focussed mainly on investment projects and country programme assistance. The
  implementing agencies have assisted developing countries in identifying projects,
  assessing national plans and policies, providing adequate technical support,
  and assistance for project development and implementation. At the same time
  the implementing agencies played a crucial role in assisting the members of
  the ExCom of the Multilateral Fund (1998) in solving difficult issues, through
  policy and technical papers.</p>
<p>In addition, the Multilateral Fund (1998) has funded and mandated UNEP to facilitate
  networks of National Ozone Units (NOUs), which enhance governments' abilities
  to manage ODS issues, and facilitate cooperative work among the implementing
  agencies, countries, technology suppliers and potential project proponents.
  Currently, there are eight regional networks consisting of 90 NOUs which meet
  regularly in their own region. Regional networking provides government ODS officers
  with a means of sharing their knowledge with their peers in developing and developed
  countries. Such networking has helped the countries to set up enabling environment
  and policy settings for favourable technology transfer. Furthermore, the establishment
  of NOUs responsible for implementing the Montreal Protocol activities at country
  level have proved to be of critical importance to develop and promote the necessary
  changes to phase out ODS in developing countries.<br>
  <br>
  A study requested by the Parties to evaluate the effectiveness of the Multilateral
  Fund (1998) indicates that the use of workshops as a primary mechanism to identify
  projects, even before a national plan is set-up and the decision to give priority
  to projects with high cost effectiveness, has favoured larger enterprises in
  developing countries (COWI, 1995). The facts that large conversion projects
  are becoming scarce and small, and medium size enterprises (SMEs) absorb most
  of the labour force in developing countries have made SMEs one of the main issues
  of the MP discussion, due to the fear that SMEs could become primary consumers
  of ODS in the medium term. </p>
<p><i>The problem of cost effectiveness</i><br>
  The main objective of the MP was to phase out as much ODS as possible in a minimum
  time frame. The cost effectiveness index reveals both the incremental costs
  (operating and capital costs) covered by the Fund versus equivalent tons of
  ODS phased out, and does not constitute a measurement of the full costs to developing
  country societies of avoiding the use of ODS. Therefore, the costs of eliminating
  ODS are borne jointly by the Fund, the enterprises and consumers (COWI, 1995).
  It should be recognised that developing countries are not merely receiving the
  funds to eliminate ODS. They are active partners by contributing their own financial
  and technical resources to meet the overall responsibilities. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the role and application of cost-effectiveness thresholds continue
  to evolve as the Executive Committee takes decisions on new concepts of investment
  projects to better assist SMEs. </p>
