<h3>9.3.3 Role of Research and Development</h3>
<p>Scientific and technical capability are crucial to the economic and industrial
  development of developing countries (Rama Rao, 1997; Song, 1997; Suttmeier,
  1997; also <a href="028.htm">Section 2.3</a> in <a href="017.htm">Chapter 2</a>
  and <a href="055.htm">Sections 4.3</a> and <a href="086.htm">4.12</a> in <a href="051.htm">Chapter
  4</a> discuss the role of R&amp;D). Technology transfer is defined as the transfer
  and development of &quot;hardware&quot; and &quot;software&quot;. The &quot;software&quot;
  may include scientific and engineering knowledge as well as managerial and operational
  skills. Direct investment in industrial R&amp;D may be included in the investment
  figures discussed above. In industrialised countries the private sector is often
  the largest investor in R&amp;D. However, in developing and transitional countries,
  the public sector is the largest contributor, e.g. in China (Song, 1997), the
  Czech Republic (Moldan, 1997) and India (Rama Rao, 1997; Tripathy, 1997). Although
  difficult to estimate, the R&amp;D funds allocated to environmental technology
  are only a small part of the total industrial technology R&amp;D budget. Energy
  R&amp;D budgets of OECD countries have declined in past decades (Williams and
  Goldemberg, 1995). Less than 6% of the total energy R&amp;D budget in IEA countries
  was spent on energy efficiency (incl. industrial technology), whereas most is
  allocated to nuclear technology R&amp;D (IEA, 1994). Scientific knowledge and
  R&amp;D are getting more and more internationally oriented, as evidenced by
  foreign direct investment in R&amp;D. It is estimated that foreign corporation
  spending in the U.S. in 1994 amounted to 15 B$, or 15% of total industrial R&amp;D
  spending (Florida, 1997). Generally, FDI in R&amp;D is comparatively small,
  mostly directed to support local industry. However, FDI in R&amp;D is growing
  rapidly, particularly in the U.S., and also the focus is changing to developing
  new products, obtaining information on local scientific developments and access
  to local human capital (Florida, 1997). International R&amp;D collaboration
  can be an effective means of technology transfer (see, for example, <a href="332.htm">Case
  Study 4</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>), and recent initiatives like
  the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI) can enhance this collaboration. Preliminary
  analysis seems to suggest that newly industrialised countries seem to increase
  the generation of scientific and technological knowledge within their countries,
  although the majority of knowledge is still generated in the industrialised
  world (Amsden and Mourshed, 1997). The type of scientific output and knowledge
  may vary by country. In India, in 1994 to 1995, total research expenditure is
  estimated to have been 0.8% of GDP (Rama Rao, 1997) and in China it was estimated
  at 0.5% in 1995 (Song, 1997), while total spending in science and technology
  development was estimated at 1.5% of GDP. The figures are slightly lower than
  the years before. However, no accurate information is available on the global
  role of and investments in scientific knowledge in developing countries.</p>
