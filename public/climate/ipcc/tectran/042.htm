<h3>3.4.1 Follow-up to the Convention commitments on Technology Transfer </h3>
<p>The first Conference of the Parties in Decision 13/CP.1 (UNFCCC, 1995) requested
  the Convention secretariat to prepare an itemised progress report on concrete
  measures taken by the Annex II Parties to fulfill their commitments related
  to the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and of the know-how necessary
  to mitigate and facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change. It also urged
  Parties listed in Annex II to include this information in their national communications
  in order to enable the Convention secretariat to compile, analyse, and submit
  the documents to each session of the Conference of the Parties. </p>
<p><a href="042.htm#b34">Box 3.4</a> outlines the subsequent development of these
  issues in successive meetings of the SBSTA. It was evident from early discussions
  in SBSTA and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) that while information
  from Annex II Parties is vital, the Parties recognised the complementarity of
  the roles of public and private sectors with technology transfer. From here
  on the emphasis was not just on Annex II Parties, but on urging all Parties
  to improve the enabling environment for private sector participation, and to
  support and promote the development of endogenous capacities and appropriate
  technology relevant to the objectives of the Convention (UNFCCC, 1996d). The
  work programme of the secretariat, in addition to its work on the technology
  inventory database, included collecting information on: technology information
  centres; technology information needs; adaptation technology; terms of transfer
  of technology and know-how; and also private sector technology transfer. COP2
  took note of the progress made in implementing Decision 13/CP.1 by reviewing
  the Convention secretariat's documents on the subject, and expressed its concern
  at the slow progress in obtaining relevant information on this matter (Decision
  7/CP.1 (UNFCCC, 1996e). The Decision also requested Annex II Parties to submit
  information so as to help Parties make informed decisions.</p>

    <td>The secretariat, after reviewing information from 21 Annex II Parties
      in the aftermath of CoP1, organised information around multilateral, bilateral,
      and private sector cooperation (UNFCCC, 1996c). It found that four parties
      did not report on activities related to transfer of technology (most of
      these communications were submitted prior to the CoP1 decision). The secretariat
      found that the Annex II Parties submitted their communications as per the
      guidelines, which did not require the kind of detail sought by Decision
      13/CP.1. Additionally, the secretariat's document points out that the part
      dealing with technology transfer could easily be subject to different interpretations
      by the Parties. The in-depth review process revealed that much more information
      is available than has been provided in the communications, leading the secretariat
      to the conclusion that a comprehensive picture of technology transfer activities
      was not available at that stage.
      <p>The secretariat prepared a report on the basis of 31 responses received
	to its request for information and supplied the same to the Subsidiary
	Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) (UNFCCC, 1996a).
	It was difficult for the secretariat to draw specific conclusions based
	on these responses. There was, however, a feeling that if more time were
	to be available to the Parties and intergovernmental organisations, the
	many other valuable reports and information sources could be reviewed
	to help with the development of a long-term work programme. In response
	to a decision by SBSTA at its second session, Annex II Parties submitted
	information on technology inventory databases (UNFCCC, 1996 a and b)*.</p>
      <p>The subsidiary bodies at their fourth and fifth sessions noted the progress
	made by the secretariat, and requested it to intensify and accelerate
	its efforts, and at the same time noted that the information provided
	by Annex II Parties differed considerably in format, comprehensiveness
	and level of detail. They urged the completion of an itemised progress
	report by its seventh session on access to, and the transfer of, environmentally
	sound technology, based on the national communications (UNFCCC, 1997a).
	By the time they met for the sixth session, the scope of work by the secretariat
	was enlarged to include specifically work with the World Bank, OECD, and
	the possibility of establishing intergovernmental technical advisory panels
	(ITAPs) at its seventh session. Moreover, there was support shown for
	the secretariat's plans to prepare reports on the role of the private
	sector, and on barriers and enabling activities of governments related
	to the transfer of technology.</p>
      <p>The secretariat in preparation for the seventh session of the subsidiary
	bodies commissioned a number of papers and presented the key findings
	in its progress report on the topic (UNFCCC, 1997c). While the summaries
	are helpful in identifying the relative roles of different types of technologies
	and centres and networks, one should look elsewhere to find the results
	of the review of national communications of Annex II Parties (UNFCCC,
	1997b). Reviewing these documents the SBSTA/SBI joint working group took
	note of the need for better information with respect to finance and transfer
	of technology, and agreed to consider at its ninth session what, if any,
	additions and/or amendments to the revised guidelines for the preparation
	of national communications by Annex II Parties would be required.</p>
      <p>Decision 9/CP.3 (UNFCCC, 1998a) requested the secretariat to continue
	its work, consult with the Global Environment Facility and other relevant
	international organisations on international technology information centres
	and exploring the possibilities of funding the same. It urges Parties
	to create an enabling environment for the private sector to play its due
	role, as well as improve the reporting by Annex II Parties in their national
	communications. </p>
      <p>In preparation for the eighth session of the subsidiary bodies, the secretariat
	produced another progress report (UNFCCC, 1998b). While this report touched
	on all of the various aspects of prior decisions, i.e. technology-information
	needs survey, adaptation technology, centres and networks, it could not
	say anything more on actions within Annex II, since any comment on this
	issue will need to come from a review of national communications and a
	review of available communications was already carried out earlier on.</p>

<p>At Buenos Aires, Decision 4/CP.4 (UNFCCC, 1999a) recommended a series of practical
  steps to promote, facilitate and finance the transfer of, and access to, environmentally
  sound technologies and know-how. It outlined the importance of supporting the
  development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing
  country Parties, and identified areas where assistance in facilitating the transfer
  of environmentally sound technologies and know-how is required. It is addressed
  to all of the Parties in light of various provisions of the Convention (Articles
  4.1, 4.3, 4.5, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and Articles 9.2, 11.1, 11.5). It asked Annex II
  Parties to provide a list of environmentally sound technologies and know-how
  related to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change that are publicly
  owned, and to report in their national communications steps taken to implement
  Article 4.5 of the Convention. It asked non-Annex I Parties to submit their
  prioritised technology needs. It invites all Parties and interested actors to
  identify projects and programmes that can serve as models for improving the
  diffusion and implementation of clean technologies under the Convention.</p>
<p>This survey illustrates the fact that technology transfer has been on the agenda
  of every session of SBSTA. Despite all of the discussions within and various
  papers produced by the secretariat, there has been limited progress on determining
  what constitutes technology transfer, the roles of the governments and private
  sector, and how compliance with Article 4.5 should be measured. As a note by
  the secretariat (UNFCCC, 1998c) pointed out, reaching agreement on these issues
  is of fundamental importance. It is vital that there be simple and agreed upon
  criteria for measuring whether Annex II Parties have met their commitments;
  the guidelines for national communications should clearly identify formats for
  reporting financial information (as an indication of the amount of technology
  transferred). In other words, as the secretariat pointed out, developing and
  reaching an agreement on what constitutes &quot;success&quot; might be an important
  issue for the Parties to consider.</p>
<p>Outside of formal discussions within UNFCCC, other initiatives on technology
  transfer are notable. Stemming from initiatives by Japan and Germany, the Climate
  Technology Initiative (CTI) was developed through the International Energy Agency
  (IEA). The CTI is still in evolution, but its activities include a variety of
  voluntary actions by IEA member states: setting up national advice and technological
  development plans; offering prizes for technological development; enhancing
  markets for emerging technologies; and promoting collaboration between states
  on technology research and development. In addition, the CTI has also established
  regional seminars on climate change related technology, and has worked in collaboration
  with the SBSTA.</p>
<p>In 1997, the IEA announced that it would increase its work with the CTI and
  seek new collaboration with existing bodies like the ISO. A new Global Remedy
  for the Environment and Energy Use (GREEN) initiative was also established,
  aiming to enhance the use of climate change mitigating technology in ODA and
  private investment.</p>
<p>However, the impacts of these official attempts to generate technology transfer
  are as yet unclear, and in terms of total investment are relatively limited
  compared with mainstream investment flows. Other complementary approaches have
  thus also been proposed. P. du Pont et al. (1997) highlight that industrialised
  countries, at the same time as calling for stronger action in developing countries,
  frequently export to them second-hand equipment that is old, inefficient and
  polluting. Citing examples from vehicles, and from the pulp and paper industry,
  they note that facilities (cars or industrial plants) are exported that are
  essentially obsolete and no longer meet standards in industrialised countries.
  They suggest that such exports should be discouraged, for example, by using
  a tax credit in developed countries to accelerate equipment renewal (perhaps
  granted only if the obsolete technology is not exported) or by &quot;negative
  emission credits&quot; for export of second-hand technologies that increase
  greenhouse gas emissions compared with state-of-the-art technology (du Pont.
  et. al., 1997). Procedures requiring &quot;prior informed consent&quot; from
  recipient countries, analogous to those in the international agreements on hazardous
  wastes and chemicals, might offer a &quot;softer&quot; alternative. </p>
<p>Overall, the need to better engage the private sector and to harness private
  investment, and much learning since the UNFCCC (including experience with AIJ
  projects summarised elsewhere in this Report), has implied rethinking the ways
  in which the UNFCCC has approached technology transfer. This has become clearer
  in the Kyoto Protocol and subsequent decisions. </p>
