<h1>10.1 Introduction<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(11,1); return false;">1</a></small></sup>
</h1>
<p>
  The purpose of this chapter is to provide information about methodological and
  technological issues in climate friendly technology transfer for the energy
  supply sector. The discussion is restricted to technologies for climate change
  mitigation, since technologies for adaptation to climate change (so-called climate
  safe) in the energy supply sector are not yet discussed in the literature and
  have little potential for the nearby future. <br>
  <br>
  The total primary energy supply including non-commercial biomass reached 398
  EJ<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(11,2); return false;">2</a></small></sup>
  in 1996, of which renewables (excluding hydro) represent 10.9% (43.4 EJ) and
  total final consumption reached 283 EJ (IEA, 1998). According to other authors
  (Craig and Overend, 1996) total primary energy supply should be higher (around
  435 EJ), since non-commercial biomass supply is probably near to 80 EJ. Global
  annual energy consumption has grown at an average amount of 2% for almost two
  centuries (SAR II B1, 1996; SPM, 1996). According to five notable global energy
  scenarios exercises (IPCC, 1992; WEC/IIASA, 1995; Kassler, 1994; Shell, 1995;
  IPCC, 1996) forecasts are quite different, ranging by a factor of 2, which means
  an average growth of 1.96% per year for the most energy intensive scenario to
  0.73% per year for the lowest one. The large difference is due to assumptions
  regarding improvements in energy efficiency, change in user habits, change in
  the profile of available energy sources and the capacity for development of
  different regions of the globe. Even so, a significant conclusion is that there
  are opportunities to improve the standard of living of the world's population
  with an increase of energy needs below the historical trend. <br>
  <br>
  Energy related CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions are projected to increase at a slower rate than
  energy consumption. Historically, CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emission intensity of both economic and
  energy activities has been decreasing by 1.3%/year since the mid 1800s (1% decline
  in energy intensity per unit of economic value added and 0.3%/year due the replacement
  of fuels with high carbon content (e.g. coal) by those with lower carbon content
  (e.g. natural gas) or those with zero carbon content (e.g. nuclear power; sustainable
  biomass) (Nakicenovic et al., 1993; Nakicenovic et al., 1996). This is a trend
  with no inducement from environmental concerns. However, with environmental
  issues gaining momentum, CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emission intensity should decline at a faster rate.
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emission in the IPCC - IS 92 scenarios from the energy sector moves from
  the 2.3 GtC/year value of 1990 to 2.3-4.1 GtC/year in 2020 and 1.6-6.4 GtC/year
  in 2050 (IPCC TP1, 1996). <br>
  <br>
  The energy supply sector is also responsible for substantial methane (CH4) emissions.
  Out of a total of 535 TgC CH4 emissions per year 100 TgC or roughly 20% is related
  to fossil fuel use (Prather et al.,1994). Of the fossil fuel related part, two
  thirds originates in the oil and gas industry (pipe and compressor leakages,
  venting and flaring) and the remaining in the coal industry (mine leakages and
  incomplete combustion) (IEA, 1997b; IEA, 1996).<br>
  <br>
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions caused by the energy supply sector can be reduced with the use
  of some or all of the following options (SAR II, 1996; SPM, 1996):</p>
<ul>
  <li> More Efficient Conversion of Fossil Fuels;</li>
  <li> Switching to Low-Carbon Fossil Fuels;</li>
  <li> Decarbonisation of Flue Gases and Fuels, and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> Storage and Sequestering;</li>
  <li> Switching to Nuclear Power; and</li>
  <li> Switching to Renewable Sources of Energy.</li>
</ul>
<p> <br>
  A recent IPCC publication (SAR II, 1996) provides a complete discussion of the
  many available technologies for each option, while another one (IPCC TP-1, 1996)
  makes an effort to quantify the amount of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> abated for each option. <a href="186.htm#t101">Table
  10.1</a> lists the technical CO<span class="subscript">2</span> reduction potential for six different mitigation
  technologies, by the year 2020. According to <a href="186.htm#t101">Table 10.1</a> CO<span class="subscript">2</span> abatements of more
  than 10% can be obtained (a more precise figure is difficult to quote since
  the mitigation potential of the individual options identified are not additive,
  because the realisation of some option is mutually exclusive or may involve
  double-counting). The technical potential of each mitigation strategy, in the
  long term, is much higher. Only replacement of coal by natural gas can reduce
  overall emission per unit of electricity generated in the range of 50%. The
  main question is how far CO<span class="subscript">2</span> abatement in the energy supply sector is cost effective
  when compared with other possible actions able to achieve the same reduction.
  A global evaluation of the optimal mixture of options for 2.4 GtC emission reduction
  concludes half of it should be performed through increasing carbon sinks (forestry),
  and a fraction of the other 25% should be obtained by improvements in energy
  conservation (Jepma and Lee, 1995). Major constraints considered in the figures
  of <a href="186.htm#t101">Table 10.1</a> are the long average life of energy conversion plants, and the
  rate of technology transfer. Most of the growth in the energy sector will occur
  in the developing countries and these usually are the last to adopt new technologies,
  due a number of issues, but particularly the absence of binding commitments
  regarding GHG emissions.<br>
