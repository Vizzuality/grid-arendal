<h1>Case Study 28</h1>
<p> Medicinal Plants vs. Pharmaceuticals for<br>
  Tropical Rural Health Care<br>
  Thomas J. Carlson,<br>
  Department of Integrative Biology,<br>
  University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-3050 </p>
<p><b>Keywords</b>:Medicinal plants, pharmaceuticals, biodiversity, ethnolinguistic
  diversity, tropical countries, USA, Europe</p>
<p><b>Summary</b><br>
  Tropical rural communities may receive treatment from locally available traditional
  botanical medicines and/or modern pharmaceuticals. Assessment of these two medical
  systems generates interesting comparisons when evaluating local indigenous versus
  external control, access, availability, affordability, long term sustainability
  and ability to safely and effectively use each medical system. Each medical
  system maintains a characteristic capital flow between North and South and rural
  and urban. Traditional botanical medicine is based on local indigenous resources
  and knowledge. Climate change and ecosystem damage diminish the local biological
  resources available to tropical rural communities to contribute to their health
  care needs. </p>
<p><b>Background</b><br>
  While pharmaceutical companies conduct advertising campaigns in tropical countries
  to increase consumption of pharmaceuticals in urban areas, most people living
  in rural areas have limited access to or can not afford these drugs. The World
  Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that 80% of people in the world use medicinal
  plants as their primary health care medicines. Research on the bioactivity of
  tropical medicinal plants has demonstrated that most are safe and effective
  therapies. Unfortunately, tropical public health programmes do not usually recognise
  the therapeutic value of traditional medicine and instead encourage widespread
  use of pharmaceuticals to treat diseases already adequately managed by locally
  available traditional botanical medicines. </p>
<p>Due to the research, development, formulation, packaging, distribution, and
  refrigeration costs, pharmaceuticals are capital and energy intensive forms
  of medicine that are under external urban and/or Northern control resulting
  in capital flow from rural to urban and South to North. These capital and energy
  inputs make the cost of pharmaceuticals high and reduce access for tropical
  rural communities. If pharmaceuticals reach these communities there is often
  not a continuous supply or available refrigeration. If refrigeration is available
  it requires a high capital input and energy consumption. Many donated pharmaceuticals
  have exceeded their expiration date and are often for ailments that are rare
  or not present in the recipient communities. When pharmaceuticals are used by
  rural populations, they are often given inappropriately (wrong dose and/or for
  wrong disease) because modern medical professionals are seldom present to correctly
  administer these medicines.</p>
<p><b>Approach</b><br>
  Locally available medicinal plants can contribute to health care needs and generate
  economic benefits for tropical rural communities. The WHO Traditional Medicine
  Programme and other research programmes have conducted research on tropical
  medicinal plants that have demonstrated safety and efficacy for the treatment
  of common tropical diseases including malaria and infections of the skin, lungs,
  and gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>Collaborative agreements may be established that enable tropical rural communities
  to harvest botanical medicines from their local ecosystems and sell them to
  northern or tropical urban areas as herbal medicines or for the extraction of
  pharmaceuticals. Twenty five per cent of modern medical drug prescriptions written
  in the United States are pharmaceuticals derived from plant species. In compliance
  with the Convention on Biological Diversity, these collaborative relationships
  between rural communities and research institutions can include agreements that
  will entitle communities to receive long term benefits if marketable pharmaceuticals
  or herbal medicines are derived from their botanical resources. </p>
<p><b>Impacts (Achieved Benefits)</b><br>
  Tropical rural traditional medicines under local indigenous control are more
  affordable, available, and sustainable forms of medicine because they do not
  require the capital and energy inputs needed for pharmaceuticals. These botanical
  medicines are typically more therapeutic and safe because the medicine source
  is locally harvested and knowledge of its medicinal use is known by the local
  ethnolinguistic group. Use of ethnobotanical knowledge can also generate economic
  benefits that result in capital flow from urban to rural and North to South
  enabling local communities to use these resources to establish land demarcation,
  community-based medicinal plant reserves, traditional medicine hospitals, infrastructure
  support for a traditional healers' union, supplies for schools, and clean water
  systems. These health care and economic benefits derived from ethnobotanical
  knowledge generate incentives for tropical rural communities to conserve their
  biological and ethnolinguistic diversity. <br>

<p>
  First, as demonstrated in <a href="356.htm#t161">Table 16.1</a>, many barriers exist to safe, effective,
  affordable, and sustainable use of modern medicines in tropical rural communities.
  Tropical botanical medicines under local rural indigenous control are more affordable,
  available, therapeutically beneficial, and sustainable for these communities.
</p>
<p>Second, modern medical health care programmes should work to complement rather
  than replace the local traditional botanical medical systems. The use of modern
  pharmaceuticals at the local rural level should be reserved to only treat those
  diseases not well managed by the local botanical medicines. When pharmaceuticals
  are used for specific ailments, there should be careful monitoring of the treatment
  by modern medical professionals to make sure the correct dose is given and the
  appropriate disease is being treated. </p>
<p>Third, the local traditional medical systems should be included as integral
  components of tropical health care programmes. </p>
<p>Fourth, use of ethnobotanical knowledge and harvesting of non-timber medicinal
  plant products from their local ecosystems can generate economic benefits for
  rural communities.</p>
<p>Fifth, the health and economic benefits of botanical medicines can establish
  incentives for rural tropical peoples to conserve their ecosystems, ethnobotanical
  knowledge, and languages.</p>
<p>Sixth, and perhaps most relevant to the climate change issue, all of these
  efforts to encourage the use of indigenous, ethnobotanical and local resources
  can help to preserve these areas, and thereby contribute to the mitigation of
  climate change.</p>
