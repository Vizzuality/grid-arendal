<h1>Case Study 23</h1>
<p> <b>CFC-free Refrigerators in Thailand</b><br>

  <br>
  <b>Summary</b><br>
  This case study is for the industrial sector and the stakeholders are Government 
  of Thailand, Hitachi, Matsushita, Mitsubishi Electric, Toshiba of Japan, and 
  the Japan Electrical Manufacturers Association (JEMA). The government of Thailand 
  and the multinational companies decided to speed the phase-out of ozone depleting 
  substances (ODSs) through a voluntary pledge. The technical challenge of achieving 
  this environmental objective for the manufacture of ODS-free domestic refrigerators 
  required an unprecedented degree of technical cooperation between fierce competitors 
  in Thailand and Japan.<br>
  <br>
  The CFCs were phased out under the Montreal Protocol by using HFCs, which are 
  regulated under the Kyoto Protocol. HFCs have much lower GWP as compared to 
  CFCs. The lesson learned from this technology transfer may be useful for similar 
  transfer under Climate Change Convention.<br>
  <b><br>
  Background</b><br>
  In a 1990 seminar conducted for the Association of South-East Asian Nations 
  (ASEAN), it was reported that electronics and refrigerator enterprises from 
  Japan, the United States and Europe were primarily responsible for dramatic 
  rates of increase in CFC consumption in Thailand. This case study considers 
  the technology cooperation undertaken to halt the use of CFCs in refrigerators. 
  Seven Japanese companies and their joint ventures in Thailand produced household 
  refrigerators in Thailand. Three of these companies imported all the critical 
  parts necessary to complete the phaseout but the other four companies used compressors 
  supplied by a single Thai company. It was therefore crucial that the Thai compressor 
  manufacturer redesign their products to use CFC alternatives, and that they 
  manufacture reliable compressors. <br>
  <b><br>
  Approach</b><br>
  The government of Thailand announced its target date for eliminating CFCs from 
  Thai household refrigerators as the end of 1996. This phaseout date for CFCs 
  used as the refrigerant and as the blowing agent for insulating foam in domestic 
  refrigerators was particularly aggressive. The first option was to keep to the 
  phaseout schedule by getting compressors from manufacturers other than the local 
  companies. This option was rejected because Japanese companies had pledged to 
  help Thailand to build local manufacturing capability. The second option was 
  to postpone the phaseout and wait for a supply of reliable compressors from 
  the local companies. This option was also rejected, because the Thai government 
  was eager to keep the phase-out on schedule. The only other option required 
  additional technology cooperation with the local compressor company. The refrigerator 
  parent companies that were buying compressors in Thailand, i.e. Hitachi, Matsushita, 
  Mitsubishi Electric, Toshiba of Japan, and the Japan Electrical Manufacturers 
  Association (JEMA) launched a voluntary emergency joint project to assist the 
  local companies to improve reliability and to help with its implementation. 
  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency attended follow-up meetings in Thailand 
  and encouraged the Thai compressor manufacturers' parent companies in the United 
  States to promote their participation in the technical support project.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Impacts</b><br>
  As a result of the corporate leadership by multinational companies, ambitious 
  goals were announced that ultimately required unprecedented technical cooperation 
  to achieve. The seven Japanese refrigerator companies and their joint ventures 
  all achieved the complete CFC phaseout by the end of 1996, the first phaseout 
  of CFCs used in domestic refrigerators by any developing country in the world.<br>
  <br>
  Because the Thai Government realised the importance of phasing out of CFCs, 
  they took measures to prohibit the manufacture or import of foreign CFC-based 
  refrigerators after 1996. This leadership action and support by the Thai government 
  encouraged the Thai refrigerator manufacturers to work hard to achieve the CFC 
  phaseout. It also created a strong motivation to phase out CFCs in refrigerators 
  manufactured in other developing countries. It is worth noting that the Japanese 
  companies, which helped the Thai companies in developing HFC-134a compressors, 
  were in direct competition to supply the other three refrigerator manufacturers 
  in Thailand. <br>
  <b><br>
  Lessons Learned</b><br>
  There are three crucial aspects to the successful achievement of global environmental 
  objectives: global leadership and commitment to cooperation for global environmental 
  protection, an early action plan from industry, and cooperation between government 
  and industry. <br>
  <br>
  This extraordinary technical cooperation can only be replicated when all of 
  these aspects can be orchestrated and when there is a strong commitment from 
  corporate management and national governments.<br>
