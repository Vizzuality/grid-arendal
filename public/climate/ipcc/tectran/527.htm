<h1>3.6 Forestry Sector </h1>
<p>Technology transfer in the forest sector provides a significant opportunity
  to help mitigate climate change and adapt to potential changes in the climate.
  Apart from reducing GHG emissions or enhancing the carbon sinks, technology
  transfer strategies in the forest sector have the potential to provide tangible
  socio-economic and local and global environmental benefits, contributing to
  sustainable development. However, existing financial and institutional mechanisms
  are inadequate and thus new policies, measures and institutions are required
  to promote technology transfer in the forest sector. </p>
<p>The forest sector includes a wide variety of environmentally sound technologies
  and practices such as genetically superior planting material, improved silvicultural
  practices, sustainable harvest and management practices, protected area management
  systems, substitution of fossil fuels with bioenergy, incorporation of indigenous
  knowledge in forest management, efficient processing and use of forest products,
  and monitoring of area and vegetation status of forests, particularly under
  afforestation and reforestation activities. </p>
<p>Forestry mitigation technologies often involve minimal technology transfer
  and are strongly linked to other environmental factors such as biodiversity.
  They also possess features which are unique to the forestry sector and need
  careful consideration in the planning of technology transfer. Such features
  include: long gestation periods, linkage to subsistence economy, vulnerability
  to natural calamities, variation with climate and location, and state control
  of forests. </p>
<p>In Annex-I countries, significant research and development (R &amp; D) and
  technology transfer occurs in the private sector, for instance through increased
  participation of timber companies and industries (paper mills). In non-Annex-I
  countries a substantial part of technology transfer in the forest sector is
  driven by forest departments, local communities and NGOs. This is particularly
  true for forest conservation practices, agroforestry systems, and systems for
  harvesting of non-timber and other subsistence products. Currently, there is
  a marginal role for private sector or industry participation in technology transfer.
</p>
<p>The existing institutional mechanisms are dominated by state forest departments,
  government ministries and multilateral institutions. . These institutions have
  several limitations to promote climate mitigation technologies, namely, limited
  resources and an absence of policies and institutions to process, evaluate and
  approve mitigation projects and activities. </p>
<p><i>Emerging technology transfer mechanisms</i><br>
  In the face of limitations of existing institutions, a number of climate mitigation
  related mechanisms have emerged in the forest sector for technology transfer,
  including the concept of joint implementation, GEF, Activities Implemented Jointly
  (AIJ), and Clean Development Mechanism (if approved under the Kyoto protocol).
</p>
<p><i>Barriers</i><br>
  The generic barriers to the current and emerging pathways of technology transfer
  mechanisms are: limited financial resources, inadequate information on the costs
  and potential benefits, limited technical capacity, absence of policies and
  institutions to process, evaluate and clear mitigation projects, uncertain additionality
  of the mitigation and its sustainability and long gestation periods for several
  options. In addition, the forest sector faces land use regulation, unclear property
  rights, and other macro-economic policies which favour conversion of forest
  lands to other land uses such as agriculture and cattle ranching. Lack of methods
  and capability for monitoring and verification need to be overcome in order
  to gain the credibility needed to capture the potential benefits of forest sector
  response options, particularly in reducing deforestation.</p>
<p><i>Technology transfer within countries </i><br>
  Technology transfer within countries is crucial in the forest sector. The sources
  of technology and management practices for in-country technology transfer are
  the forest departments of local and national governments; research institutions
  and university laboratories; paper, pulp, timber logging and plantation industries;
  and indigenous communities. Th transfer can be stimulated through funding, regulations
  and awareness raising programmes.</p>
<p><i>Technology transfer within Annex-1 countries </i><br>
  For technology transfer within Annex-I countries, the policies in timber importing
  countries are critical to ensure environmentally sound technology transfer within
  timber exporting countries. Governments can play a role in timber certification
  or labelling, levying of import or customs duty on non-certified timber, provision
  of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) principles, investment in forestry R
  &amp; D, preference for SFM-certified wood for public construction, recycling
  of paper through financial incentives and promotion of public awareness. NGOs
  can create awareness in consumers to promote the use of certified timber and
  recycled paper. The private sector in Annex-I countries could play a role in
  the development of criteria and indicators for SFM, development of certification
  schemes and their adaptation to the national/regional level. </p>
<p><i>Technology transfer within non Annex-1 countries</i><br>
  Within non-Annex-I countries, the government's role includes regulations on
  timber extraction companies, enforcement of forest conservation, removal of
  subsidies to deforestation, financial incentives for adopting SFM and creating
  technical capacity for monitoring of forest areas and promotion of research
  on causes of deforestation and their impacts. The important emerging role for
  the private sector includes linkages between industry and farmers for future
  technology transfer. The role of industry is crucial in facilitating technology
  transfer to a large number of small and dispersed farmers. Technology transfer
  could be facilitated as part of a package from industry to farmers including
  credit, technology and marketing arrangements. NGOs could create public awareness
  regarding forest conservation, SFM practices and recycling, and ensure compliance
  with legislation and policies by the government departments, industries and
  timber logging.</p>
<p><i>Technology transfer between Annex-I and non-Annex-I countries</i><br>
  For technology transfer between Annex-I and non-Annex-I countries, the government
  roles could include promoting the multilateral and bilateral agencies to (1)
  support funding of forest-sector mitigation projects and programmes through
  grants and low interest loans for SFM practices, industrial plantations, protected
  areas, and forest restoration programmes, (2) setting up forest monitoring and
  verification programmes in non-Annex-I countries, and (3) providing funding
  for institution and human capacity building. In the private sector, timber companies
  could import technologies and transfer them to farmers, co-operatives and forest
  departments. NGOs and dedicated international institutions could contribute
  to international verification and monitoring programmes on sustainable logging
  practices. </p>
<p><i>Technology transfer among the Annex-I and among non-Annex-I countries:</i><br>
  Technology transfer among the Annex-I countries is largely private sector driven.
  Mechanisms such as timber certification and financial incentives for sustainably
  logged timber could facilitate adoption of sustainable practices. So far the
  technology transfer among the non-Annex-I countries has been marginal. But it
  is important as there are ecological and socio-economic similarities among these
  mostly tropical countries. Currently the level of technology transfer among
  non-Annex 1 countries is increasing.</p>
<p><i>Adaptation</i><br>
  Countries where forest vegetation is likely to be adversely affected by climate
  change may have to set up institutions to assess the impacts of projected climate
  change in their region and to develop adaptation strategies as a first step
  towards developing strategies for increasing forest resilience. Any adverse
  impact of climate change will affect forest ecosystems and the local communities
  and economies, which depend on them. Thus, the major responsibility for developing
  and adopting technologies to minimise the adverse impacts and to increase forest
  resilience, will rest with the government. Multilateral institutions such as
  FAO, CGIAR institutions and World Bank will have to play a critical role in
  developing, transferring and implementing adaptation technologies, as the adaptation
  technologies may be similar for a given forest type, within the tropical or
  temperate forest regions. </p>
<p>The existing institutional mechanisms may be inadequate, and in many countries
  there are no significant incentives for the local governments and local communities
  to protect and manage forests as carbon sinks. Adoption of mechanisms to promote
  technology transfer in the forestry sector requires strengthening of existing
  institutions as well as the creation of new institutions. The majority of the
  new institutions are likely to be set-up in non-Annex-I countries. It is very
  important to establish internationally acceptable monitoring and verification
  procedures and institutions. The existing and emerging financial mechanisms
  may also have to be strengthened and reoriented to promote forestry mitigation
  projects. The role of the private sector is increasing in the forest sector
  technology transfer. Governments will have to create policy environments to
  facilitate private sector participation in technology transfer programmes, as
  in many countries forests are still largely controlled by the state forest departments.
