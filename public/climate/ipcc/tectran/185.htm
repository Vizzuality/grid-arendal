<h1>Executive Summary </h1>
<p><i>General</i><br>
  Major objectives of the current energy supply sector are economic development
  and international competitiveness. Climate change objectives, particularly the
  reduction of carbon dioxide (CO<span class="subscript">2</span>) emissions,
  do not play a significant role. Nevertheless, significant opportunities exist
  to reduce CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions (see <a href="186.htm#t101">Table
  10.1</a>) as well as other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.</p>
<p>Technology transfer in the oil, natural gas and electricity sectors is mainly
  driven by the private sector. On the other hand, coal, nuclear and renewable
  energy sources are often dependent on government to preserve or increase their
  presence in the market. Technology transfer, as presently understood, is a relatively
  new process since historically it was used as a euphemism for large-scale power
  projects financed by multilateral banks, or for limited knowledge transfer from
  the international oil and gas companies to national industries. The oil crises
  in the 1970s changed the contractual terms in the oil and gas sectors and enabled
  powerful national oil companies to negotiate technology transfer on terms that
  were more favourable to them. In the early 1990s, the process of market globalisation
  and the availability of private capital on a global scale triggered investments,
  and hence technology transfer opportunities in the electricity sector also.
  The private sector is now playing a bigger role in electric power generation
  in concert with a new set of regulations and standards. </p>
<p>In the energy supply sector, technology transfer comes with investment. One
  of the keys to the transfer of technology is to promote investment through an
  appropriate economic and institutional framework. For some clean energy supply
  alternatives technology improvement is necessary for large-scale commercialisation.
  In general, economic and institutional barriers rather than technology availability
  are more apt to be the cause of failure to transfer technology. In all energy
  sectors, the role of government in facilitating technology transfer is critical.
  Annex II countries could develop more effective policies to stimulate and finance
  private investments in clean energy sources in developing countries and countries
  with economies in transition (CEITs). Governments could initiate policies for
  liberalising the energy supply market, fostering and ensuring conditions to
  allow international financing, promoting infrastructure development, eliminating
  unnecessary regulatory and trade barriers, educating and training local workforces,
  protecting intellectual property rights, and for strengthening local research
  and development (R&amp;D) and environmental management regimes. <a href="197.htm#t102">Table
  10.2</a> lists for each major technology group the existing barriers preventing
  their transfer, as well as the possible policies to overcome such barriers.</p>
<p>It is expected that markets will respond to whatever regulatory policies are
  adopted to promote GHG emissions reduction. Technology transfer will be stimulated
  as investments are made in response to the price signals when uncertainties
  on policies to secure environmental goals are settled.</p>
<p><i>Fossil Fuel and Nuclear</i><br>
  Technology transfer in the fossil fuel sector is mature, and well-established
  mechanisms are in place. Technology is readily available from a wide variety
  of sources, such as the oil, gas, and coal industries, engineering contractors,
  equipment vendors, etc. Barriers to technology transfer, therefore, are primarily
  economic and institutional.</p>
<p>Technology transfer in the nuclear power sector for water-cooled and water
  moderated reactors is mature and has well-established mechanisms. To further
  promote the successful transfer of nuclear technology, major government involvement
  is needed. The large capital costs, public acceptance, availability of cheap
  domestic fossil fuel, and safety and waste disposal concerns provide significant
  barriers to the use of nuclear energy. In many cases, nuclear proliferation
  issues are also a major problem to be addressed by governments and other international
  institutions.</p>
<p>Specific measures and policies could include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create and/or enlarge the market for clean energy technologies by, for
    example: </li>
  <li> using high efficiency technology and procedures in electric power generation;</li>
  <li> switching to lower carbon fuels (eg. substituting natural gas for coal);</li>
  <li> using combined heating (cooling) and power generation where feasible;</li>
  <li> using sequestration of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> where feasible; and</li>
  <li> using high efficiency in electric power generation.</li>
  <li> Enhance regional cooperation in development and transportation of natural
    gas and electricity across national boundaries.</li>
  <li> Increase efficiency by promoting dissemination of best practices.</li>
  <li> Educate the public on the benefits and risks of nuclear power.</li>
  <li> Develop infrastructure and trained personnel required to insure the highest
    possible level of nuclear safety.</li>
</ul>
<p> <br>
  <i>Renewables</i><br>
  In the renewables sector, with the exception of large scale hydropower, technology
  transfer has been constrained by the lack of investment and high costs. Investment
  has been generally limited to niche (such as solar photovoltaics (PV) or wind
  power) or protected markets because of technical, institutional and economic
  barriers. Governments could promote the development of improved and more cost
  effective renewable technologies, provide incentives for investment and remove
  policies which hinder the application of renewable energy.<br>
  <br>
  Measures to improve renewable technologies could include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <i>Biomass</i> - Promote RD&amp;D on biomass crop selection, conversion
    technology, and integrated systems.</li>
  <li> <i>Solar</i> - Promote RD&amp;D on PV integrated systems.</li>
  <li> <i>Wind</i> - Develop performance standards for wind turbines.</li>
  <li><i> Hydro</i> - Promote development of hydropower consistent with environmentally
    and socially sustainable development.</li>
</ul>
<p> <br>
  Measures to promote investment and broaden the market for renewables could include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <i>General</i></li>
  <li> Create political and regulatory frameworks to allow full cost pricing,
    and recognize the indirect benefits of renewables such as the creation of
    more local jobs, improvement of the environment, balance of trade, etc.</li>
  <li> Develop human and institutional capacities.</li>
  <li> Foster joint research and technology development.</li>
  <li> Promote assessment of the potential of renewables in appropriate countries.
  </li>
  <li> Involve local communities, mainly in small size energy supply projects.</li>
  <li> <i>Biomass</i> - Develop biomass resource assessment (including agricultural
    residues) for countries with biomass potential.</li>
  <li> <i>Solar</i> - Promote market development through government procurement
    and low cost financing and in-country technology transfer.</li>
  <li><i> Wind</i> - Develop resource assessment to allow market to judge potential.</li>
</ul>
