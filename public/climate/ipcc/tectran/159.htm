<h1>8.3 Technology Transfer Pathways </h1>
<p>In general, the transfer of transport technology goes through the five different
  stages outlined in <a href="003.htm">Chapter 1</a> (assessment, agreement, implementation,
  evaluation and adjustment, and repetition). Also, the pathways for technology
  transfer involves the three main pathways (government driven, private sector
  driven, and community driven) mentioned in the first chapter; however, government
  and private sector driven pathways are more dominant than community driven pathways.
  In addition, the transfer of transport technologies can either be market-oriented,
  including recent trends such as globalisation and liberalisation, international
  production networks, and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A); occur via regional
  networks; or be non-market-oriented. In general, the path of transfer differs
  according to the type of technology. Market-oriented private sector pathways
  are used on transactions involving vehicle and fuel technologies while bilateral
  and multilateral treaties are common for transport infrastructure that are government
  driven pathways. The relatively more recent introduction of privatisation in
  infrastructure development and maintenance is attracting market transactions
  such as joint ventures, management contracting and concession arrangements in
  such transactions. More recently, technology licensing has become a preferred
  strategy for market oriented pathways, because of its capacity to be a component
  of a technology-based global product strategy, especially for more matured technologies.</p>
<p>In the transport sector, significant technology is being transferred through
  M&amp;A and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows. More recently, growth in
  inter-firm technology agreements has had an impact in the transport sector.
  FDI has being growing substantially for the past seven years, surpassing growth
  in ODA, and the transport sector has been part of that growth, especially among
  major transport MNCs in both industrialised and developing countries. Cross-border
  M&amp;A in the automobile industry such as General Motors (GM) acquiring Isuzu
  and Suzuki of Japan, Vauxhall from the U.K and Opel from Germany is an example
  of transport technology transaction across countries. Two-way inter-firm technology
  partnerships, which involve joint research and development agreements and the
  creation of joint R&amp;D ventures with specific research programmes, are increasing,
  and the automobile industry is the third largest with such type agreements (UNCTAD,
  1998). This creates a major pathway for transferring technology across firms,
  because as R&amp;D become more knowledge intensive firms tend to concentrate
  their efforts to remain competitive. Hence, concentration of R&amp;D efforts
  may increase in the future. </p>
