<h1>3.4 Energy Supply </h1>
<p>Major objectives of the current energy supply sector are economic development 
  and international competitiveness. Climate change objectives, particularly the 
  reduction of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions, do not play a significant 
  role. Nevertheless, significant opportunities exist to reduce CO<span class="subscript">2</span> 
  emissions (see <a href="522.htm#tts5">Table TS5</a>) as well as other GHG emissions.</p>
<p>Technology transfer in the energy sector is mainly driven by the private-sector
  in oil, natural gas and electricity supply. On the other hand, coal, nuclear
  and renewable sources are often dependent on government to preserve or increase
  their presence in the market. Technology transfer, as presently understood,
  is a relatively new process since historically it was used as an euphemism for
  large-scale power projects financed by multilateral banks or for limited knowledge
  transfer from the international oil and gas companies to national industries.
  The oil crises in the 1970's changed the contractual terms in the oil and gas
  sector when powerful national oil companies were able to negotiate technology
  transfer on more favourable terms. In the early 1990's, the process of market
  globalisation and the availability of private capital on a global scale triggered
  investments and hence technology transfer opportunities in the electric sector
  also. The private sector is now playing a bigger role in electric power generation
  in concert with a new set of regulations and standards. </p>
<p>In the energy supply sector, technology transfer comes with investment. One
  of the keys to the transfer of technology is to promote investment through an
  appropriate economic and institutional framework. For some, the high initial
  costs of clean energy supply technologies is a major barrier for their transfer.
  In general, economic and institutional barriers rather than technology availability
  are more apt to be the cause of failure to transfer technology. In all energy
  sectors, the role of government in facilitating technology transfer is critical.
  Annex II countries could develop more effective policies to stimulate and finance
  private investments in clean energy sources in developing countries and CEITs.
  Developing countries and CEIT governments should have policies in place for
  liberalising the energy supply market, fostering and ensuring conditions to
  allow international financing, promoting infrastructure development, eliminating
  unnecessary regulatory and trade barriers, educating and training local workforce,
  protecting intellectual property rights and strengthening local R&amp;D and
  environmental management regimes</p>
<p><b>Barriers</b><br>
  General barriers for technology transfer in the energy sector are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Lack of incentive for the major utilities: electric utilities sell electricity
    through a regulatory review process that allows the utility to recover all
    operating expenses, including taxes and a fair return for its pendent investments.
    This means that independent of the quality of the service they will be reimbursed
    by the operational costs;</li>
  <li> Lack of human qualifications in developing countries. Without investment
    in capacity building the existing electric service is of lower quality compared
    with industrialised countries, information gathering is not a priority and
    new technologies, which may be less costly or more environmentally friendly,
    are not even taken into account;</li>
  <li> Although many countries are revising their trade policies in order to liberalise
    markets, substantial tariff barriers for imports of foreign technologies including
    energy supply equipment remain in many cases. This limits exposure to energy
    efficiency improvement pressures from foreign competition on domestic suppliers
    and prevents early introduction of sustainable energy innovations from abroad;</li>
  <li> Political interference and corruption caused by powerful construction groups
    which prefers the installation of more generation capacity based on conventional
    technologies;</li>
  <li> Institutional and administrative difficulties to develop technology transfer
    contracts, which can be a necessity to qualify regional construction companies
    as potential partners of the entrepreneurship. There is a need for greater
    regional co-operation among developing countries both in R&amp;D work and
    in the international commercial contracting network;</li>
  <li> Poor access to information. It is one thing to recognise that the information
    and technology desired are available, but it is quite another issue to gain
    access to them. That will require that developing countries strengthen their
    linkages with the rest of the world by investing in the infrastructure needed
    to receive and transfer information;</li>
  <li> A major requirement for successful agreement in technology transfer is
    the guarantee of intellectual property rights ( IPR). In the energy sector,
    a well-developed mechanism exists for sharing IPR. It is the production-sharing
    contract. Under this agreement, private firms contract with local parties,
    usually state-owned companies or governments, to share technology with them
    in return for a share of the products produced. This practice has proven very
    successful in the international oil and gas sector and could be a model for
    other energy supply areas;</li>
  <li> Needs of the developing countries are quite different to these of the developed
    countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Policies</b><br>
  It is expected that markets will respond to whatever regulatory policies are
  adopted to promote the reduction of GHG emissions. This will stimulate technology
  transfer as investments are made in response to the price signals when uncertainties
  on policies to secure environmental goals are settled. A number of generic strategies
  can promote and/or facilitate the implementation of some of the emission reduction
  options in the energy sector. These strategies could include (but are certainly
  not limited to):</p>
<ul>
  <li> Creating political and regulatory framework to allow full cost pricing
    and recognise the indirect benefits of renewables such as the creation of
    more local jobs, improvement of the environment, balance of trade, etc.</li>
  <li> Providing information and general training to government officials -The
    advantages and local/international opportunities provided by the measures
    and technologies must be presented to top officials in a manner that is both
    forceful and forthright; top officials embracing the concept;</li>
  <li> Providing specific information and training to local actors - Training
    of a very specific and practical nature must be provided to personnel at the
    local level;</li>
  <li> Encouraging the implementation and enforcement of energy and environmental
    standards - Standards require the capability to enforce them by recruiting
    and training enforcement personnel and supplying them with the necessary tools
    and high-level administrative support needed for credible implementation of
    sanctions. Setting up these regulations and support structures is an area
    where international assistance may be valuable for some countries;</li>
</ul>
<p>Governments play a special role in the creation of markets for ESTs. This can
  be done by governments through procurement of new technologies for public missions
  like energy production and distribution, and provision of incentives for its
  development, including grants, low interest loans, import duty exemption, income
  tax exemption, tradable permits and competitively determined subsidies. Grants
  are a very common incentive used to stimulate adoption of a new technology in
  developed countries (e.g. The Clean Coal Program in US) An example of the use
  of income tax exemption is the Green Funds scheme in The Netherlands. Also in
  the Netherlands a pilot a trading mechanism for Green Certificates (including
  a spot and forward market) has been established for renewably generated electricity,
  which makes it feasible to reach quantified targets for renewable energy introduction
  efficiently. Competitively determined subsidies have been employed such as the
  Non-Fossil-Fuel Obligation (NFFO) in UK, and the electricity feed law (EFL)
  in other parts of Europe.</p>
<p><b>Fossil Fuel </b><br>
  Technology transfer in the fossil fuel sector is mature, and well-established
  mechanisms are in place. Technology is readily available from a wide variety
  of sources, such as the oil, gas, and coal industries, engineering contractors,
  equipment vendors, etc. Barriers to technology transfer are primarily economic
  and institutional. Specific measures and policies could include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Creating and/or enlarging the market for clean energy technologies like:
    <ul>
      <li> switch to lower carbon fuels such as the substitution of natural gas
	for coal</li>
      <li> using of combined heating (cooling) and power generation where feasible</li>
      <li> using sequestration of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> where feasible use of high efficiency in
	electric power generation</li>
      <li> using of high efficiency in electric power generation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Enhancing regional co-operation in development and transportation of natural
    gas and electricity across national boundaries.</li>
  <li> Increasing efficiency by promoting dissemination of best practices.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Nuclear</b><br>
  Technology transfer in the nuclear power sector for water-cooled and water moderated
  reactors is also mature and has well-established mechanisms. Because of the
  unique safety, ecological and proliferation risks involved, successful transfer
  of nuclear technology requires major government involvement and careful consideration
  of the costs and benefits involved. The large capital costs, lack of public
  acceptance, availability of cheap domestic fossil fuel and the resolution of
  safety and waste disposal provide significant barriers to the use of nuclear
  energy. In many cases, nuclear proliferation issues are also a major problem
  to be addressed by governments and other international institutions. Developing
  infrastructure and trained personnel is required to insure the highest possible
  level of nuclear safety.</p>
<p><b>Renewables</b><br>
  In the renewable sector technology transfer has been constrained by the lack
  of investment and high costs. Investment has been generally limited to niche
  or protected markets, because of technical, institutional and economic barriers.
  Governments need to provide incentives for investment and to remove policies
  that hinder the application of renewable energy as described in the general
  policy measures above. They also need to promote the development of improved
  and more cost effective renewable technologies amongst others by:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Developing human and institutional capacities;</li>
  <li> Fostering joint research and technology development;</li>
  <li> Promoting assessment of the potential of renewables;</li>
  <li> Involving local communities, mainly in small size energy supply projects.</li>
</ul>
