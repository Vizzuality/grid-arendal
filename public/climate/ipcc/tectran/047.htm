<h3>3.5.2 Private Investment and Intellectual Property Rights </h3>
<p>As illustrated in the previous chapter, the private sector plays an increasingly
  important role in international investment and technology development. This
  growing role has been supported by various domestic and international developments,
  including liberalisation of markets, development of stronger domestic legal
  and financial systems, and tariff reductions under the Uruguay Round of the
  GATT. In the context of technology transfer, a particularly important - and
  complex - set of issues are those relating to intellectual property rights (IPRs).
  IPRs may play an important role in ensuring economic returns to investors (including
  R&amp;D resources they have devoted to developing and improving technologies),
  and to an extent enabling the transfer of and availability of protected technologies
  (see <a href="047.htm#b36">Box 3.6</a>). </p>

    <td>In very general terms, intellectual property rights protect human innovation
      and intellectual effort. IPRs include patents (utility patents, design patents,
      plant patents), plant breeder rights, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights.
      Patents are specific rights granted by governments to inventors which enable
      the right holder - the inventor - to exclude third parties from utilising
      or exploiting or commercialising the protected invention in the countries
      where these are registered. To be protected under patent law, inventions
      need to be new, have an inventive step and industrial application.
      <p>From an economic perspective, IPRs enable entrepreneurs to cover research
	and development expenses and ensure some profit from the use of the protected
	idea or invention returns to the innovator. From a sociological or anthr
	opological perspective, IPRs serve to reflect those ideas most valued
	by a culture, although certainly this should not imply that IPR protected
	innovations are necessarily those most valuable to society.</p>
      <p>The standard economic justification for granting property rights over
	intellectual property is that this furnishes incentives for creative work.
	IPR regimes are premised on the belief that prospective financial returns
	in fact drive private creators of intellectual property. They do not necessarily
	guarantee that innovation takes place at least social cost, which will
	depend among other things upon the extent to which creators may borrow
	ideas or concepts from earlier work.</p>
      <p>From a societal perspective, one economic objective of an IPR regime
	could be to maintain a proper balance between creating and disseminating
	intellectual property. If innovations are not widely used, the net society
	benefits may be less than in a case where fewer resources are employed
	in creativity but the intellectual property is more widely disseminated.
	This focuses attention on the appropriate scope of protection: the optimal
	duration of IPR protection, and the optimal trade-off between the duration
	and breadth of IPR protection. </p>
      <p>Another way of looking at this is that a lack of IPR protection will
	enable everyone to access a technology, but this comes at a dynamic cost
	of deterring further innovation, and thus may stifle (positive) development.
      </p>
      <p>These interests may differ between developed and developing countries.
	Hence, it is unavoidable that there are disputes over the appropriate
	degree of protection when it comes to international transfers. These issues
	were debated very widely in the context of the GATT debates that led ultimately
	to the TRIP agreement. </p>

<p><i>International development of IPRs and the TRIP agreement</i><br>
  IPRs were originally regulated exclusively at the national level and subject
  to national legislation. Regimes for IPR tended to vary widely, especially between
  developed and developing countries, due to differing interests, cultures and
  administrative capacities. Industrialised countries tend to see IPRs as a primary
  means for promoting technology development by offering inventors protection
  to reap profits from their labours. Developing countries tended to be more concerned
  to access existing technologies at affordable costs, and to make them more widely
  available. Not surprisingly, developing countries tended to have far weaker
  IPR laws than industrialised countries. The World Intellectual Property Organisation
  (WIPO) sought to foster and harmonise IPR protection and disseminate information.
  Its mandate includes, subject to the competence of other organisations, promoting
  creative intellectual activity and facilitating the transfer of technology related
  to industrial property.</p>
<p>Continuing differences in IPR treatment became a source of considerable international
  dispute in the 1980s, and the US especially threatened some developing countries
  with retaliatory trade action if they did not improve IPRs protection (Doane,
  1994). At the same time, developing countries began to believe that stronger
  IPRs regulation could help them to attract more foreign technology and to develop
  stronger markets (Kwon, 1995). These developments have led to more common international
  standards for IPR protection during the 1990s. </p>
<p>In particular, the 1994 Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual
  Property (TRIP), negotiated in the context of the Uruguay Round, is leading
  to increased homogeneity of laws around the world in accordance with minimum
  standards. According to Worthy (1994) the agreement &quot;is a major breakthrough
  in the international protection of intellectual property rights, because of
  its substance and because of the wide measure of international acceptance it
  achieved&quot;. TRIP was adopted in the context of a trade negotiation and therefore
  was accepted as part of a &quot;package&quot;. The main provisions are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li> The establishment of minimum standards for the protection and enforcement
      of a wide variety of intellectual property rights, including the extension
      of copyright principles to computer code and certain kinds of databases;
    </li>
    <li> A principle of &quot;national treatment&quot;, preventing IPR discrimination
      in favour of domestic industries;</li>
    <li> A principle of &quot;most favoured nation&quot;, preventing IPR discrimination
      between investors from different signatories to the TRIP agreement.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The TRIP regime on patents is particularly relevant to technology transfer;
  it sets a minimum of 20 years for patent protection, it sets minimums for patentable
  subject matter, and it sets minimum standards as to the conditions that must
  be met for patents to be issued. It also establishes agreement on procedures
  that must be followed before countries can grant compulsory licences. </p>
<p>The TRIP agreement allowed developing countries four years (from January 1996)
  in which to make necessary changes, with an additional five years for least
  developed countries or others facing serious implementation difficulties. </p>
<p><i>Effects of stronger IPR protection</i><br>
  The benefits that may derive from legal systems having strong intellectual property
  rights include the following: an increase in innovation due to the incentive
  and reward that IPRs provide; fair treatment of innovators who can own the creative
  &quot;sweat of the brow&quot; and exert influence over how their technology
  is used; public disclosures of patented technologies, sharing of secrets under
  confidentiality agreements; ease of purchase, sale, or license; and enhanced
  investment due to the assurance that investors can recapture their investment
  in a technology subject to such protection. </p>
<p>Great IPR protection should give greater confidence for R&amp;D investment
  in new technologies and processes. It should also lead to greater investment,
  including with new technology by western companies in developing countries,
  although empirical research suggests this may not be as significant as hoped
  for (Kwon, 1995). Trebilcock and Howse (1995), in a survey of foreign investors,
  note that intellectual property protection was rated the least important of
  five factors affecting investment decisions in Thailand. Certainly, although
  in theory strong IPR systems should promote foreign investment, in the case
  of certain technologies it is not enough to have these systems in place. There
  is a need for the planning of technological development and better identification
  of technological needs. Furthermore, all countries do not necessarily need cutting
  edge technology to satisfy specific needs, particularly with respect to clean
  technologies.</p>
<p>In other respects, stronger IPR systems can impede technology development and
  transfer. The World Bank's 1998 World Development Report cautions that &quot;there
  is now a risk of excessively strict IPRs adversely affecting follow-on innovations
  and actually slowing down the pace (of technological development)&quot;. The
  report goes on to identify patents which cover &quot;not just products but broad
  areas of technology&quot; as a particular concern. Concerning international
  transfer, a country that seeks to obtain a beneficial new technology for its
  inhabitants may find that the owner of the technology is unwilling to provide
  it on terms that the country (or host companies involved) can afford, whether
  or not there is IPR protection. </p>
<p>Thus, there is no absolute &quot;right&quot; degree of IPR protection, and
  notwithstanding the TRIP agreement, IPR regimes differ according to national
  circumstances and the agreements that governments have entered into, the technologies
  involved, and their national objectives. In addition, the appropriate response
  might be to negotiate specific guarantees with investors, rather than increasing
  intellectual property protection across the board (Trebilcock and Howse, 1995).
  In certain sectors and markets, including some energy and environmental sectors,
  the main advantages to investors may accrue simply from continued technological
  innovation and managerial expertise, in which case IPR issues may not be very
  important to them, and rigorous application of IPR may simply impede valuable
  technology transfer with little compensating benefit (Trumpy, 1997). In other
  cases, the reverse may be true. </p>
<p>International law recognises the right of a country to take legislative measures
  to provide for the granting of compulsory licenses to prevent the abuses that
  might result from the exercise of the exclusive rights conferred by the patent.
  While the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 1883,
  and WTO through TRIP referred above deal with the subject broadly, the North
  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) of 1993 and OECD's proposal for a Multinational
  Agreement on Investments (MAI) severely restrict the use of compulsory licensing
  of patents. This issue has been addressed in several international fora, including
  UNCTAD, the Rio Summit, UNGASS and discussions within CSD. A survey conducted
  in 1999 indicated that a number of countries both among the Annex I and non
  - Annex I countries have legislation listing the circumstances under which provisions
  for compulsory licensing could be invoked (Health Care and IP, 1999). </p>
<p><i>IPRs and developing countries</i><br>
  As noted in the context of TRIP negotiations, developing countries have particular
  concerns about IPRs. The great majority of patents are owned and continue to
  be generated from the industrialised world; developing countries and their companies
  tend to have fewer resources to purchase licences and fear that stronger IPRs
  impede their access to such technologies. Indigenous companies or communities
  may find that traditional approaches are not familiar to investors, and will
  have difficulty competing with larger companies that have extensive experience
  obtaining and dealing with IPRs. The culture of competition may also make it
  difficult to obtain relevant data in the short term.In other words, it is probable
  that stronger IPR protection may to some degree enhance vertical technology
  transfer through foreign investment, but may in some circumstances impede horizontal
  dissemination of protected technologies through developing country societies.
  Forsyth (1999) emphasises this distinction, but argues that the climate change
  debate on technology transfer has tended to undervalue the potential contribution
  of vertical technology investment in its own right. Besides, international financial
  assistance could be made available where market-driven licensing is not feasible.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the impediments in any single case must be weighed against the
  overall societal advantages of IPR in promoting investment and innovation. Technology
  transfer is necessary to reach certain development goals, but developing countries
  argue that the balance of IPR weighs to the advantage of developed countries.
  In practice the incentive effects of IPR, weighed against the impediments they
  may raise to technology transfer, will differ according to the technology, sector,
  and country. While trade theory provides little basis for mandating uniform
  standards of intellectual property protection across all countries, intellectual
  property rights is an issue that is here to stay on the international trade
  agenda (Trebilcock and Howse, 1995).</p>
<p>Finally, in some circumstances, inadequate access or abuse of IPRs may be addressed
  through compulsory licensing procedures. Under Articles 30 and 31 of TRIP, member
  countries may provide for compulsory licensing of patented inventions, i.e.
  use of the invention without permission. Generally, compulsory licensing programmes
  require the user first to seek a license, and if no license is given, then a
  limited non-exclusive right to practice the invention domestically may be awarded
  by the government, with an obligation to pay reasonable compensation to the
  patent owner.</p>
<p><i>IPRs and the promotion of ESTs </i><br>
  The importance of IPRs needs to be set in context. Many of the technologies
  for addressing climate change may not be protected anyway. This may apply both
  to &quot;soft&quot; technologies, such as better energy management or agricultural
  practices, and &quot;hard&quot; technologies such as building insulation. Where
  there is no patent in force in the country seeking to acquire technology, the
  main barriers to technology transfer will be (1) inadequate technical expertise
  and know-how in the country, (2) the absence of professionals in the country
  able to negotiate a suitable transfer agreement, and (3) the willingness of
  the technology owner to transfer the technology. Training and education are
  necessary to overcome the first two barriers. The third barrier may be overcome
  with financial support and encouragement by the technology owner's country,
  the technology recipient's country, or through bilateral or multilateral arrangements
  (<i>e.g.</i> the GEF). </p>
<p>In other cases, relevant technologies may indeed be protected. What steps can
  governments take to use IPRs to improve transfer and development of ESTs? IPR
  systems can be harnessed specifically towards environmental objectives in some
  circumstances (Gollin, 1991). Patents on environmentally friendly technologies
  have been increasingly common since before the main environmental statutes were
  implemented in the 1970s. In the US, patent regulations were amended in 1982
  (37 C.F.R. q.102-c) to provide for faster processing of environmental patents
  there. The practical impact of such provisions is uncertain. </p>
<p>In certain circumstances, existing patents may affect ability to comply with
  domestic regulations. The US Clean Air Act of 1970 (42 USC 7608) permits compulsory
  licensing in such circumstances: if the Attorney General identifies that a patented
  technology is needed by others to comply and there are not reasonable alternatives,
  then the US Courts are authorised to order licensing, &quot;on such reasonable
  terms and conditions as the courts, after hearing, may determine.&quot;</p>
<p>For some developing countries seeking access to patented technologies in connection
  with international environmental treaties, one option might be for license fees
  to be paid for by an international funding source such as the GEF and/or through
  bilateral or multilateral arrangements. </p>
<p>Another way a country may address the concern for an unlicensed patent is to
  charge increasing annual maintenance fees. If the fee becomes high enough by
  5 to 10 years after patent issuance, the owner will let an uncommercialised
  patent lapse (Sherwood, 1990). It will then become part of public domain.</p>
<p>Trademarks for environmental products can be crucial to their success and help
  facilitate widespread acceptance of a product. So-called &quot;green labelling&quot;
  programmes employ trademark or related principles (e.g. A not-for-profit organisation
  allows a vendor to use an environmental seal of approval if certain requirements
  are satisfied).</p>
<p>This section has highlighted the complexity and specificity of the issues,
  so that generalisations may not be helpful. Governments can support the exchange
  of public domain information. And governments can provide incentives for private
  parties to implement technology transfer programmes or joint ventures. Under
  extraordinary cases of IPR abuse, compulsory licensing can be considered.</p>
<p>Quite apart from legal and IPR issues, cooperation plays a critical role in
  promoting technology transfer. Likewise, national planning and specifically
  identifying national needs becomes a pre-condition to any IPR-related discussion
  as it is only when the type of technology or expertise needed has been identified
  and the specific circumstance assessed that the IPR question becomes relevant.</p>
<p>Finally, while IPR and other developments have helped to facilitate combined
  foreign investment, they have not generally oriented such investment particularly
  towards sustainable development or environmentally sound technologies. That
  is the function of other international agreements. </p>
<p><i>IPRs and Restrictive Business Practices</i><br>
  In reviewing the actual practice of IPR, the issue of Restrictive Business Practice
  (RBP) of the private sector deserves adequate attention and analysis. Various
  types of RBPs ranging from refusal of licensing to attaching restrictive or
  even prohibitive conditions for royalty and equipment sales to maximise the
  monopolistic rent were reported. These RBPs are more often practiced in the
  initial stage of the innovation where there are not yet many other competitors.
  After the initial stage, other competitors may enter with similar technologies
  leading to the abolishment of RBP.. Companies often quickly change their behaviour,
  and try to sell and license their own technology in order to maximise its market
  share. Businesses management theory identifies strategies for &quot;competitive
  advantage&quot; whereby companies will manipulate the market in any manner that
  can suit their global strategies (Porter, 1980; 1990; Porter <i>et al.,</i>
  1995).</p>
<p>In order to maintain monopoly or competitive advantage, companies go after
  their potential competitors in other countries and register their patents to
  block similar technology development, and dump their products to drive out new
  competitors with similar technologies from the market. Several studies have
  been done that verify this strategy of using intellectual property rights as
  a market advantage and as a strategy to control markets, as well as dominate
  innovation within industrial sectors (Narin et al., 1998, Mowery and Oxley,
  1995; and Teece <i>et al.,</i> 1994) </p>
<p>According to a case study (UNCTAD, 1997a) on the experience of Korean companies
  importing foreign ESTs, the types of restrictive conditions are: non-exclusive
  basis, restriction on export, prohibition of consigning to a third party, sharing
  of improved technology, restriction on the licensee for dealing in competitive
  products or technologies. Among 523 technologies introduced in 1994, 122 (23.3%)
  were accompanied with restrictive conditions. </p>
<p>According to Korean firms and R&amp;D institutions, there were cases where
  the private firms and even public institutions of industrialised countries refuse
  to license such ESTs like HFC-134a, fuel cell and IGCC (Integrated Gasification
  Combined Cycle). Some private firms sell their equipment under the condition
  that the buyer cannot disassemble the equipment. </p>
<p>These RBPs have not been widely reported and sufficiently analysed. However,
  there are some cases of RBPs related to HFC-134a, fuel cell, and IGCC technologies
  that were identified in Korea. </p>
<p>The case of HFC-134a technology draws particular attention. In the initial
  stage of HFC-134a technology introduction, companies with HFC technologies refused
  to license or sell the technology. When Korea launched its programme to develop
  HFC-134a technology, a (foreign) company already having this technology registered
  40 process patents in Korea in 1993 in an attempt to block the development of
  similar technology. As Korea neared completion of its own HFC-134a technology
  development, this company changed its policy and approached a Korean company
  to sell its HFC-134a technology. </p>
<p>The experience is not confined to CFC technology. Among 168 Japanese technologies
  introduced to Korea in 1994, 15 (8.9%) were not allowed to be consigned to a
  third party, and, respectively, 13 (7.7%) were granted on a non-exclusive basis
  and on condition that improved technologies should be shared between two parties
  during the contract period. Seven (4.2%) were prohibited to be used for export
  products and 3 (1.8%) were granted on condition that the licensee cannot deal
  in competitive products or technologies. Among the 209 US technologies introduced
  to Korea in the same year, 10 (4.8%) were not allowed to be consigned to a third
  party, and 28 (13.4%) were granted on a non-exclusive basis and on condition
  that improved technologies should be shared (12 or 5.7% and 16 or 7.7% respectively).
  As suggested in the above statistics, Japan seems to impose more unfavourable
  conditions on technological transfer than the US (UNCTAD, 1997a).</p>
<p>Even though at the time of writing this Report there were not many published
  reports or articles on such business practices (RBP), evidence is mounting.
  The case of Korea is only one among many. Some scholars have noted the problems
  at the company level Lundvall, 1993), while others have documented how companies
  have prevented the introduction of new technologies into the marketplace (Shaynneran,
  1996) in order to advance and retain their current own technological advantages
  (Clark and Paolucci, 1997a &amp; b; and The Economist, 1999a and b). For a comprehensive
  economic historical overview of the problem, see Reinert (1995) on the abuses
  of the technological change and international competitiveness. More recent studies,
  including those reported in the business management literature begin to question
  such competitive strategies (Saxenian, 1994; Reinert, 1995 and Clark and Paolucci,
  1997 a &amp; b).</p>
<p>RBPs for other technologies could be simply regarded as the exercise of the
  intrinsic monopolistic power recognised by the patent system. But if these RBPs
  are exercised for ESTs in general and on the issue of EST transfer to developing
  countries, which would both have local as well as global environmental implications,
  then the implications of RBPs in hindering technology transfer deserve research
  and analysis. </p>
