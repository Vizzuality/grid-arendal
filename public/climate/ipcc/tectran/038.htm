<h3>3.3.2 Technology Transfer as a &quot;Positive Measure&quot; in Multilateral
  Environmental Agreements </h3>
<p>The literature on global participation in Multilateral Environmental Agreements
  (MEAs) has increasingly emphasised the need to balance measures of enforcement
  with those of facilitation. Weak capacity can itself impede effective participation
  by developing countries in MEAs (including difficulties with the adoption and
  effective implementation of some kinds of commitments) There are a wide variety
  of instruments available for both enforcement and facilitation. The term &quot;positive
  measures&quot; is increasingly used for non-trade measures that facilitate participation
  in MEAs (UNCTAD, 1997b). </p>
<p>Osakwe (1998) presents a categorisation of such measures (<a href="038.htm#t31">Table
  3.1</a>) in which technology transfer is first on the list of such positive
  measures. He summarises the results of several years of work in the WTO Trade
  and Environment Committee, at UNCTAD, and elsewhere, illustrating the role of
  technology transfer while cautioning against simplistic treatment of &quot;positive
  measures&quot;: </p>
<p>Positive measures tend to be considered as second order supplementary measures,
  offered as compromises only to weaker countries and firms lacking in capacity.
  Although developing countries may, on balance, need these non-restrictive measures
  more, this reasoning is incomplete. Positive measures are also required by developed
  countries and firms. </p>
<p>UNCTAD has proposed an agenda for positive measures and offers suggestions
  for implementing positive measures. UNCTAD also highlights three difficulties
  that hinder the implementation of positive measures. First, compared to trade
  measures, there are no implications which arise from the abandonment of commitments
  to positive measures [for the country abandoning them]. Second, the viewpoint
  expressed at several Conferences of Parties is restated: that exclusive rights
  granted under Intellectual Property Rights regimes could increase the cost of
  acquiring technologies authorized by MEAs. Third, apart from provisions for
  financial mechanisms in some MEAs, there are no explicit references to mechanisms
  for technology transfer, for instance, through the purchase of equipment, licensing,
  foreign investment, application of scientific research results in the public
  domain.</p>
<p> Balanced views should always be presented. For example, rebating energy taxes
  on weaker industries have produced unintended effects of increasing pollution
  levels . Also, long grace periods for adjustment by developing countries and
  weak producers have downsides. They could lead to high dependence, high phase-out
  costs for the developing countries, and the likelihood of the migration of environmentally
  harmful industries in the application of positive measures the &quot;guilty&quot;
  - polluters - should never be rewarded, weak capacities notwithstanding.</p>

<p>During the 1990s financial mechanisms in MEAs have become more widespread.
  The Global Environment Facility, obviously, has become a central actor for climate
  change and other agreements. Other specific experience of technology transfer
  and other positive measures in MEAs is limited to date, but growing. </p>
<p>Two major examples of MEAs, in addition to the UNFCCC, with strong components
  relating to technology transfer are the <i>Montreal Protocol and the Convention
  on Biological Diversity.</i> </p>
