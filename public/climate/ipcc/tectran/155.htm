<h3>8.2.1 Vehicle Technology Improvements </h3>
<p>Vehicle technology improvements normally involve proper maintenance, improving
  the engine or vehicle body, or reducing inertia with the main aim of reducing
  the energy intensity (energy use per useful product) and so reducing carbon
  emissions. Regular servicing, including regular tire and oil checks, and engine
  tuning can lead to fuel savings of 2-10% (Davidson, 1992; Pischinger and Hausberger,
  1993). Use of three-way catalytic converters along with electronic fuel injecting
  systems can result in reduction of ozone precursors (unburned HC, CO, NO<span class="subscript">x</span>)
  emitted from gasoline cars and heavy-duty vehicles, but the effect on global
  warming is uncertain because the impact of fuel consumption is also uncertain
  (IPCC, 1996). Improved combustion by use of gas turbines and low-heat-rejection
  engines can potentially result in higher efficiency and, thus, in lower emissions,
  but there will be a need for high temperature materials along with compatible
  high temperature lubricating systems. Also, direct-ignition stratified-charge
  engines can be more efficient because of their ignition enhancing qualities.
  Details of these potential reductions are given in <a href="155.htm#t82">Table
  8.2</a>. The potential exists for increasing vehicle mileage and, therefore,
  energy intensity by reducing the aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance leading
  to improved efficiency and, thereby, reducing the emissions (ETSU, 1994; DeCicco
  and Ross, 1993). Similarly, through size reduction, material substitution or
  component redesign, the inertia can be reduced and so lower the fuel consumption
  (DeCicco and Ross, 1993). Improving the transmission system to electronically
  allow for optimal speed and load conditions can result in energy savings and
  reduced emissions (Tanja<i> et al.,</i> 1992; NRC, 1992). More details of these
  potential reductions are summarised in <a href="155.htm#t83">Table 8.3</a>.

<p>Trends show that if priorities shift among manufacturers and users, improvements
  of 10-25% in energy intensity may be achievable on cars by 2020 at a higher
  cost, but the potential for commercial vehicles will be smaller. However, fuel
  savings and environmental gains may be offset by the increase in number of vehicles
  and driving (Wootton and Poulton, 1993).</p>
<p>The trend in buses for higher level of comfort and safety, and more powerful
  engines has tended to increase fuel consumption per seat compared with old buses,
  but this can be reduced by using advanced composite materials and turbo-compound
  diesel engines. Electric buses are in use as minibuses in urban areas, but they
  have higher GHG emissions than diesel buses when the primary emissions than
  diesel buses when the primary energy used is from fossil sources. Hybrid buses
  (diesel/electric) are now being tested because they can save up to 30% in energy
  if the motor/generator efficiency is about 85%. Alternative fuels (CNG, alcohol
  fuels and vegetable oils) are used in buses and when rapeseed methyl ester is
  used as substitute for diesel, life-cycle GHG emissions can be reduced by 25-50%
  (IEA/OECD, 1994). Use of turbo-charging and charge cooling in engines of trucks
  improves the fuel economy and so reduces GHG emissions, but retarding fuel injection
  worsens the fuel economy. Potential exists for improvement in fuel economy based
  on developments of new engine materials (IEA/OECD, 1993). Fuel economy can also
  be improved in the design of trains. About 5-10% savings is possible in diesel
  locomotives and up to 30% if a regenerative braking system is used in urban
  metro systems; 15% savings could be realised in suburban train systems and 5-10%
  for inter-city systems.</p>
<p>Energy intensity in aircraft can be improved with engine modifications and
  new engine designs. Future improved supersonic engines that are expected after
  2010 may lead to an increase in energy efficiency and lower emissions, but this
  improvement could lead to increase traffic movements (Balashov and Smith, 1992).
</p>
<p>Energy intensity for boats can be improved by modifying marine engines by making
  improvements in the hull and propeller designs that could yield to higher energy
  gains. The use of vertical-axis turbines as sails can assist the engine and
  result in energy savings (CEC, 1992). </p>
