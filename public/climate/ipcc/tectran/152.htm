<h1>Executive Summary </h1>
<p>Transport-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the second-fastest growing
  worldwide, but the transport sector is the least flexible to change due to its
  almost complete dependence on petroleum-based fuels and current entrenched travel
  lifestyles. Transportation is growing worldwide, and so are carbon emissions.
  Over 65% of the growth is by Annex I countries, but the share by non-Annex I
  countries will increase faster in the future as they satisfy their development
  needs (IPCC, 1995). The overall expected growth in transport-related GHG emissions
  will be huge and reducing it to meet the demands of the climate convention will
  require major changes because of the limits of technology changes and entrenched
  lifestyles. Significant change in current use patterns and lifestyles people
  in the transport sector of developed countries are needed, and efforts should
  be made to avoid repetition in developing countries. These changes are very
  challenging for the transport sector. </p>
<p>Efforts mainly driven by other concerns than climate change have led to technological
  options (improved technology design and maintenance, alternative fuels, vehicle
  use change, and modal shifts) and non-technical options (transport reduction,
  and improved management systems) that can reduce GHG emissions significantly.
  Similarly, there are non-transport options such as urban planning, and transport
  substitution such as tele-matics and improved telecommunications. Some options
  are low cost such as vehicle and aircraft maintenance, stringent enforceable
  regulatory systems along with inspection and testing, improved driving, fleet
  control, improved signalling, and better road signs. Others that involve changes
  in infrastructure such as modal change, dedicated lanes for different systems,
  and convenient walkways can be expensive and have long lead times. Greater use
  of light and heavy rail transport for both passenger and freight transport can
  result in reduction of GHGs, but initial cost can be high. Reducing transport
  intensities such as more use of public transport modes, re-organisation of local
  markets, regionalisation of production, and use of new logistics systems for
  freight travel can lead to substantial GHG reductions, but may require change
  in lifestyles. Disparities in technological conditions, socio-economic and historical
  factors necessitate the transfer of these options through market and non-market
  oriented paths within and between countries. </p>
<p>Significant barriers exist in the transfer of these options such as lack of
  a suitable business environment and technological capacities in technology recipient
  countries; in addition, there is a lack of a stimulating environment for transfer
  in technology supplier countries. However, policies such as promoting co-operative
  technology agreements between companies of different countries can result in
  joint R&amp;D and other activities leading to transfer of some of these transport
  options and overcome some implementing barriers. Similarly, joint information
  networks can lead to transfer of improved technical and management skills. Creating
  an enabling environment in countries worldwide will stimulate technology outflows,
  and increase technology inflows to and from these countries with greater participation
  of the private sector. In addition, specialised-training programmes through
  technical assistance can enhance local technical capacities in technology recipient
  countries. Adoption of appropriate standards and regulations can stimulate and
  facilitate technology transfer within and between countries. Partnership between
  government and the private sector and among countries can also help promote
  technology transfer within and between countries. </p>
