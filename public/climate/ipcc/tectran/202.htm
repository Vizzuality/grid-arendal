<h3> 10.5.1 Barriers to Technology Transfer between Countries</h3>
<p>
  Many barriers exist for technology transfer between countries:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Access to capital is limited. The capital costs of ESTs are generally higher
    than those of conventional technologies. Also, owing to the risks perceived
    for new technologies, financing costs will tend to be higher. Moreover, the
    availability of FDI is limited and unevenly distributed around the world.</li>
  <li> Although many countries are revising their trade policies in order to liberalise
    markets, substantial tariff barriers remain in many cases for imports of foreign
    technologies including energy supply equipment. This limits exposure to energy
    efficiency improvement pressures from foreign competition on domestic suppliers
    and prevents early introduction of sustainable energy innovations from abroad.
    Where foreign exchange limitations and public revenue considerations make
    across-the-board tariff removal difficult, preferential treatment of ESTs
    could be a realistic option. </li>
  <li> National interest groups such as powerful extraction and construction companies
    can influence technology choices in favour of conventional technologies.</li>
  <li> Institutional and administrative difficulties exist to develop technology
    transfer contracts, which can be a necessity to qualify regional construction
    companies as potential partners of the entrepreneurship. There is a need for
    greater regional cooperation among developing countries, both in R&amp;D work
    and in the international commercial contracting network.</li>
  <li> Developing countries have in general poor access to information. It is
    one thing to recognise that the information and technology desired are available,
    but is quite another issue to gain access to them. That will require that
    developing countries strengthen their linkages with the rest of the world
    by investing in the infrastructure needed to receive and transfer information.
    In this undertaking, partnerships are key: between research institution in
    developed and developing countries, between domestic and foreign firms, and
    between research institutions and the private sector. A modern information
    and communication infrastructure provides up-to-date technical information
    and publications, and allows instant communication among scientists around
    the world. Technical information services linked to worldwide information
    networks distribute knowledge quickly and cheaply to the producing sector.
    Thanks to satellites, the developing world can leapfrog immediately to advanced
    telecommunications capabilities, by passing the long road already travelled
    by the industrialised countries (Greene and Hallberg, 1995).</li>
  <li> A major requirement for successful agreement in technology transfer is
    the guarantee of intellectual property rights (IPR). Without an IPR law that
    is effectively enforced, there is little incentive for private companies to
    share their technology. The cost of IPR is usually quite small when compared
    to the capital investments and risks that are involved. In the energy sector,
    a well-developed mechanism exists for sharing IPR. It is the production-sharing
    contract. Under this agreement, private firms contract with local parties,
    usually state-owned companies or governments, to invest and share technology
    with them in return for a share of the products produced. This practice has
    proven very successful in the international oil and gas sectors, and could
    be a model for other energy supply areas (see <a href="045.htm">Section 3.5</a>
    in <a href="033.htm">Chapter 3</a> for an elaborative treatment of IPRs).</li>
  <li> Needs of the developing countries are quite different to those of the developed
    countries. Developing countries are generally still focused on large capacities
    of cheap, reliable power with low technical risk, and have new technologies
    as a lower priority. Industrialised countries have the infrastructure to assimilate
    riskier new technologies, whereas developing countries do not. However, this
    approach prevents developing countries from technological leapfrogging.</li>
  <li> Economic incentives for donors are weak mainly when energy demand is scarce
    and scattered. This barrier can be minimised by the additional potential value
    gained through JI/CDM schemes.</li>
</ul>
