<h3>15.6.5 Enabling Policies, Programmes and Measures</h3>
<p>Several critical factors, which may be part of pathways within countries to
  varying degrees, are suggested to be integral components of any international
  coastal-adaptation technology transfer (BCSD, 1992):</p>
<ul>
  <li> Technologies must be adjusted, oriented and made appropriate for local
    conditions in the host country. For example, the Japanese government designed
    and constructed a seawall to protect the shoreline fronting Nuku'alofa, the
    capital of Tonga, against erosion (Mimura and Pelesikoti, 1997). Despite the
    superior design and effectiveness of the structure, the project was not extended
    and duplicated because the host government had neither the funds, the physical
    capacity to produce the necessary raw materials nor the technological expertise
    to build another such seawall. Another example involves the copying of a Northern
    European harbour design, including a device to reduce ice pressure, which
    was installed in its entirety in a tropical country (UNFCCC, 1999).</li>
  <li> Technology transfer must involve long-term partnerships and be linked to
    training and human-resource development. In the case of the first application
    of CoreLoc (<a href="349.htm">Case Study 21</a>), the researchers were not
    involved in planning and construction of the breakwater units. Results were
    more satisfactory in subsequent deployments when the researchers were able
    to work with local operators during project implementation. Furthermore, engaging
    local operators in the development of technology generates skills necessary
    to provide feedback required to continue the innovation process.</li>
  <li> Institutional regional or global networks are powerful mechanisms for fostering
    all aspects of coastal-adaptation technology transfer, including assessment
    of needs, information exchange, training and technical assistance, capacity
    building and technology development. Examples are the above-mentioned GEF-funded
    projects (PICCAP and CPACC) as well as the training and outreach activities
    of the Coastal Resources Center of the University of Rhode Island (USA).</li>
</ul>
<p> In addition, Kozmetsky (1990) and Heaton et al. (1994) have identified a number
  of mechanisms that would be particularly important in the development and implementation
  of science and technology policies to be responsive to global economic trends.
  All of these are applicable to enabling and accelerating coastal-adaptation
  technology transfer:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the creation of strategic alliances;</li>
  <li> the development of innovative financial arrangements;</li>
  <li> leveraging international standards on environmental management;</li>
  <li> establishing technology &quot;intermediaries&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p> The creation of new strategic alliances is a way to leverage scientific and
  technical talent, share financial resources and risks and extend access and
  delivery of new knowledge and technologies to other countries. These alliances
  may be intra- or intersectoral, but work best when participants share similar
  strategic goals, mutually understand and respect their respective cultures,
  and understand short- and long-term expectations. The PICCAP approach, for example,
  involves the appointment of a national coordinator and country teams in each
  of the ten participating countries. This strategy helps to ensure that technical
  support is provided in a socially and culturally sensitive manner, that project
  outputs are compatible with regional environmental and development strategies
  and priorities and that regional institutions are strengthened for future activities
  (Sem, 1998).<br>
  <br>
  Development of innovative financial mechanisms may include linking ODA to foreign
  direct investment (BCSD, 1992), tax incentives for joint ventures in technology
  development and tax exemptions of income derived from technology transfer (Midlock,
  1990). <a href="092.htm">Chapter 5</a> presents a comprehensive overview of
  opportunities to overcome financial barriers to climate-related technology transfer.<br>
  <br>
  Private-sector demand for adaptation technologies could be enhanced and refocused
  by international standards on coastal management. International standards allow
  companies to measure environmental performance, establish best practices across
  industries and establish a degree of accountability through certification, thus
  improving a company's worldwide competitive advantage (Heaton et al., 1994).
  For example, the ISO 14000 Series Standards Environmental Management System
  (EMS) provides a framework that responds to the short-term changes in coastal
  environments brought about by development pressures as well as the long-term
  changes resulting from natural forces. Adoption by countries could provide mechanisms
  necessary to integrate vulnerability assessment with existing coastal-adaptation
  practices.<br>
  <br>
  As stated, NGOs can play an important part as intermediaries and knowledge translators
  in the technology-transfer process. As intermediaries, they can identify sources
  of currently available and emerging technologies, facilitate investment arrangements,
  and provide management, technical and other assistance to developing countries.
  As knowledge translators, NGOs can ensure that technology transfer is designed
  to create adaptive capabilities within the receiving country to adapt technology
  rather than simply to encourage its passive acceptance after transfer. NGOs
  can provide the foundation for the long-term relationship needed to replace
  casual or short-term connections between technology providers and users. Finally,
  they are particularly suited to link technology transfer to training and human-resource
  development and to public awareness raising.</p>
