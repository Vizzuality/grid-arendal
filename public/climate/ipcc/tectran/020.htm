<h1>2.2 Technology Transfer Quantified </h1>
<p>Measuring technology transfer is difficult given the diverse and complex ways
  in which transfers occur. It would be so even if the task were confined to quantifying
  the transfer of hardware. When &quot;software&quot; elements such as education
  and training are included in a broad definition of technology transfer (as is
  done in <a href="003.htm">Chapter 1</a> and then used throughout this Report),
  the task is further complicated; it becomes almost impossible if some judgement
  about effectiveness is also demanded. &quot;How much effective technology transfer
  related to climate change mitigation or adaptation takes place between countries
  each year?&quot; is an interesting question, but one that cannot be answered
  with any confidence. Data are simply not collected and analysed in a manner
  that informs policy makers interested in the issue. In commenting on the effect
  that changing patterns of international finance have on the environment, one
  observer has noted that &quot;aggregate data on international financial flows
  obscure important variations across all relevant variables thereby failing to
  provide much guidance for strategic planning related to particular environmental
  issues or geographic areas of interest&quot; (World Resources Institute, 1998).
</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties it is possible to draw some general conclusions
  about global technology flows based on information in the literature. Various
  organisations collect, analyse, and present data on international trade, development
  assistance, foreign direct and portfolio investment, foreign lending, and related
  topics. One problem is that none of these corresponds directly to the government,
  private sector, or community dominated pathways for technology transfer used
  roughly as the organising scheme for analysis elsewhere in this Report, although
  different stakeholders generally favour different delivery mechanisms. Used
  with some caution and an understanding of their limitations, however, such data
  can give a crude indication about levels of international technology transfer,
  and how these levels are changing over time. </p>
