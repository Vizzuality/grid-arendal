<h3>7.5.2 Energy Pricing </h3>
<p><i>Within Countries</i><br>
  For the market to stimulate investments in energy efficiency, energy prices
  must reflect the full cost of providing energy to end users. While this is true
  for all end-use sectors, it is particularly relevant in the buildings sector,
  because of the political interest in keeping energy prices low to homeowners
  in countries with administered price systems. Where energy prices are subsidised,
  homeowners and commercial building owners and managers receive muted signals
  on the benefits of investing in efficiency, undercutting the potential market
  for energy-efficient products. In countries with administered price systems,
  the industrial sector often subsidises the housing sector. These cross-sector
  subsidizes can make industries less competitive. If the housing subsidies were
  paid by governments, taxes would need to be increased or funds diverted from
  other public services, such as education or health care. </p>
<p>A World Bank study of the effect of energy price increases in six countries--Columbia,
  Ghana, Indonesia, Malaysia, Turkey and Zimbabwe--found that eliminating subsidies
  does not cause disproportionate hardship for the poor, lower economic growth,
  create inflation or reduce industrial competitiveness, but does improve public
  revenues (Hope, 1995). The consumption of commercial fuel increases greatly
  with income, according to the study, so energy subsidies largely benefit non-poor,
  urban households. A study of subsidised household energy prices in transition
  economies also concluded that they benefited the rich more than the poor (Freund,
  1995). One approach is a staged removal of energy subsidies, which creates a
  market for investments in energy-saving products and services.</p>
<p>The landlord-tenant relationship can create problems unique to the buildings
  sector when the landlord pays the energy costs, but has little control over
  the energy-using practices of the tenant. For tenants, if energy services are
  free, there is no incentive to use energy wisely. Technical problems may also
  make it difficult to make homeowners and tenants responsible for the energy
  they use. In many high-rise multifamily buildings, heat is delivered to apartments
  through vertical pipes, making it difficult and costly to try to measure the
  energy used by each individual apartment unit. In new buildings, this problem
  can be addressed by building codes that require that heating systems be designed
  to serve individual, metered apartment units.</p>
<p>Even in market economies, energy prices rarely include the full societal costs
  of related environmental externalities. These costs are reflected in adverse
  health impacts and environmental degradation. If the market mechanism is to
  exercise its full potential for achieving environmental goals, the price of
  energy needs to incorporate these environmental externalities. </p>
<p><i>Among Countries</i><br>
  The lessons learned from in-country technology transfer programmes also need
  to be recognised in international programmes. This is particularly important
  for countries moving toward market economies. During this transition, it is
  often useful to ask: Who is paying the energy costs?. Someone is. It may be
  municipalities through subsidies, industries through cross-sector subsidises,
  or energy supply industries through unrecovered costs. Whoever is paying these
  costs will have an interest in reforms. It is also useful to track the flow
  of energy from source to end use, to identify the changes in ownership, to metre
  the quantity of energy in each transaction, to measure the performance of each
  owner, and to move toward a system of rewards and penalties that improves the
  overall efficiency of the energy delivery system. </p>
<p>Multilateral and bilateral assistance programmes can encourage the movement
  to full-cost energy pricing by ensuring that any projects that are supported
  incorporate progress toward market reforms. The Russian Enterprise Housing Divestiture
  Project of the World Bank exemplifies this approach. The Bank is providing loans
  of US$300 million for basic energy efficiency measures in a total of 3,500 residential
  apartment buildings in six Russian cities. The participating cities are undertaking
  policy reforms designed to reduce housing maintenance and utility costs. The
  World Bank is also initiating a similar project in Lithuania. </p>
