<h1>9.6 Lessons Learned </h1>
<p>The industrial sector is extremely diverse and involves a wide range of activities
  including the extraction of natural resources, conversion into raw materials,
  and manufacture of finished products. Due to the wide variety in activities,
  energy demand and GHG emissions vary widely. Hence, the aggregate energy use
  and emissions depend on the structure (or specific set of activities) of industry,
  and the energy and carbon intensity of each of the activities. The structure
  of industry may depend on the phase of the economy, as well as many other factors
  like resource availability and historical factors. Industrial production and
  GHG emissions are still dominated by industrialised countries, but the role
  of developing countries in world industrial production, especially Southeast
  Asia, is increasing. Cost-effective potentials and opportunities for GHG emission
  abatement exist in all regions and industrial sectors. A wide variety of practices
  and technologies to reduce GHG emissions are available (see <a href="171.htm#t92">Table 9.2)</a>, 
  often with high paybacks. </p>
<p>In industry, energy efficiency is often the result of investments in modern
  equipment, stressing the attention to sound and environmentally benign investment
  policies. Investments in technology (including hardware and software) in the
  industrial sector are dominated by the private sector. Recent trends in globalisation
  of industry seem to affect the international transfer of investments and technology.
  Foreign direct investment (FDI) is rapidly increasing, although concentrated
  on a small number of rapidly industrialising countries. These countries may
  have an impact on regional industrial development patterns, as seen in Asia.
  Private investment in other developing regions is still limited, although increasing.
  FDI is dominated by transnational companies, while SMEs in industrialised, developing
  countries and CEITs have less access to (international) financial markets and
  technologies. Although difficult to measure, domestic investments in developing
  countries are still larger than FDI. Official development assistance, although
  earmarked for low to medium income countries, is also concentrated on a few
  countries. Public funding (in industrialised, developing countries and CEITs)
  for technology development and transfer, although still important, is decreasing.
  Funding for science and technology development is important to support industrial
  development, especially in developing countries. Public funding in the industrial
  sector, although small in comparison to private funding, remains important but
  its future role may be changing. Regular evaluation of the goals of public funding
  is needed for industrial development with respect to the role of cleaner technologies
  and with respect to the role of private funds.</p>
<p>Barriers limit the uptake of more efficient technologies. These barriers may
  include the (un)willingness to invest in (new) technologies, the level of information
  and transaction costs, the lack of effective financing (e.g. lack of sufficient
  funds, high interest), the lack of skilled personnel and a variety of other
  barriers, e.g. the &quot;invisibility&quot; of energy and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emission savings
  and the lack of inclusion of external costs. Developing countries and CEITs
  suffer from all of these factors that inhibit market acceptance of technologies
  plus a multitude of other market problems. Consumers often have no knowledge
  of energy efficiency (technologies) or cannot afford increases in equipment
  costs, due to a limited ability to pay increased initial costs, limited foreign
  currency and high inflation rates. A well developed banking system and existence
  of appropriate financing mechanisms are essential for the uptake of efficient
  and cleaner technologies in industry.</p>
<p>Traditionally, technology transfer is seen as a private transaction between
  two enterprises. However, innovation and technology transfer is an interactive
  and iterative process, involving many different parties. An effective process
  for technology transfer will require interactivity between various users, producers
  and adaptors of technology. The variety of stakeholders makes it necessary to
  have a clear policy framework as part of an industrial policy for technology
  transfer and cooperation, both for a technology donor and recipient or user.
  Such a framework may include environmental, energy, (international) trade, taxation
  and patent legislation, as well as a variety of well-aimed incentives. The framework
  may help to give the right signals to all parties, as well as help to develop
  innovative concepts for technology assessment, financing, procurement, adaptation,
  repetition and development. Policymakers are responsible for developing such
  a comprehensive framework. The interactive and dynamic character of technology
  transfer stresses the need for innovative and flexible approaches, through (long-term)
  partnerships between various stakeholders, including public-private partnerships.</p>
<p>The case studies and the literature demonstrate clearly that there is a strong
  need to develop the capacity to assess and select technologies. Stakeholders
  (policymakers, private investors, financing institutions) in developing countries
  and CEITs have even more difficult access to technology information, stressing
  the need for a clearinghouse for information on climate abatement technology.
  Various innovative policy concepts, including networking and joint research
  and information organisations, were found to be successful. To increase the
  likelihood of success, long term support for capacity building is essential,
  stressing the need for public support for capacity building and cooperation
  of technology suppliers and users. </p>
<p>Adaptation of technology to local conditions is essential, but practices vary
  widely. Countries that spend on average more on adaptation seem to be more successful
  in technology transfer. As countries industrialise the technological capabilities
  increase rapidly, accelerating the speed of technology diffusion and development.
  This demonstrates that successful technology transfer includes transfer of technological
  capabilities, which may be beneficial to both the supplier and user. Technology
  users, suppliers as well as financial institutions and governments could give
  attention to adaptation as an essential and integral part of technology procurement.
</p>
<p>The introduction and diffusion of clean or low-GHG technologies in the industrial
  sector needs a sound environmental and economic policy, stressing the need for
  long term goals and commitment by policymakers. This also means that technology
  transfer needs to be incorporated in R&amp;D strategies, as many (public) environmental
  sound technologies &quot;remain on the shelves&quot; and are not brought into
  the market as rapidly as may be expected. Several countries and equipment suppliers
  envisage that environmentally sound product development can enhance the future
  competitive position of domestic suppliers, making technology transfer (through
  strengthening local capacity and demonstration of technology) a way to open
  new export markets. Subsequently, policies to support the development of new
  technologies and markets could be used in these countries as part of economic
  and trade policies.</p>
