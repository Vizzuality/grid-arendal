<p> <b>Coastal Zone Management for Cyprus: Trans-national Technology Transfer

  <br>
  <b>Summary</b><br>
  In 1993 the Government of Cyprus and Delft Hydraulics jointly started the Study
  &quot;Coastal Zone Management for Cyprus&quot; under the framework of the European
  Union programme MEDSPA (MEDiterranean Strategy and Plan Action). The contract
  involved transfer of technology and know-how on shoreline management and erosion
  control technologies from the Dutch Consultants to the staff of the Coastal
  Unit of the Public Works Department of Cyprus.<br>
  The major objectives were:</p>
<ul>
  <li> capacity building and development of local expertise within the Coastal
    Unit through transfer of technology and on-the-job training</li>
  <li> development of proper methods to protect the coastline and improve the
    quality of the beach where necessary, without any serious consequences to
    the environment</li>
</ul>
<p> The outcome of the study formed the basis for further work on Shoreline Management
  in Cyprus, which is currently being conducted by the Coastal Unit.<br>
  <b><br>
  Background</b><br>
  Cyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean. The Coastal zone is
  of vital economic importance for the island and is under increasing pressure
  mainly due to tourism development. During the late 1970s and 1980s, erosion
  of the coastline and shortage of fine sandy beaches led to a sectoral approach
  to managing the receding coastlines. This included construction of coastal defence
  structures without considering any long-term effects. This approach resulted
  in a series of problems such as erosion of neighbouring areas, water quality
  problems, disruption of the ecological balance in the areas with coastal structures,
  etc. In light of these problems and considering the coasts as a natural resource,
  the Government of Cyprus recognised an immediate need for an integrated approach
  for managing the coastal zone.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Approach</b><br>
  The Study was co-financed by the Government of Cyprus (50% of the funding) and
  the European Union through the MEDSPA programme. The free coastline of Cyprus
  was divided into 12 littoral cells. A monitoring system was set up in order
  to generate scientific data concerning morphology and dynamics of the coastal
  zone. Numerical models were used to analyse and process the data in order to
  identify and describe the natural system components. <br>
  <br>
  The technical committee appointed to oversee the operations included scientists
  from eight governmental departments. The committee also sought active participation
  of the local authorities and private sector though a series of workshops and
  meetings. The study resulted in the preparation of Shoreline Management plans
  for three selected coastal areas. Furthermore, environmental impact studies
  were carried out for the proposed coastal structures.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Impacts</b><br>
  The technologies proposed by the Study to combat erosion included: 1) retreat
  management in areas with no coastal development and 2) beach nourishment supported
  by the construction of low-crested offshore breakwaters, and demolition of the
  existing vertical groynes in highly developed coastal areas. All stakeholders
  accepted the proposals. However, the implementation process was constrained
  by specific barriers. For instance, budget allocation took three years of negotiations
  with the involvement of the Council of Ministers. The recent decision (in 1998)
  on this matter defines that coastal protection work is going to be co-financed
  by the Government and the local authorities. However, since some local authorities
  have financial problems with their contribution, the implementation of the study
  is still partly pending.<br>
  <br>
  The task pertaining to defining specific set-back lines for each coastal area
  is still pending due to lack of funding for the study and limited number of
  scientific personnel.<br>
  <br>
  Lack of borrow material to proceed with beach nourishment. The seabed from the
  coastline up to 20 m depth is protected by the Barcelona Convention (protection
  of Posedonia Meadows), thus making dredging a difficult option. Detailed investigation
  around the coasts of Cyprus revealed that the entire seabed in waters deeper
  than 15 m consists of extremely fine sediment, which is unsuitable for beach
  nourishment. The investigation of land borrow pits was also unsuccessful. The
  option of importing sediment from neighbouring countries was rejected due to
  the extremely high costs and other ecological considerations. Based on the above,
  it was decided that beach nourishment was not feasible as a solution for general
  application in Cyprus. A small-scale pilot project has monitored the coastal
  area the last three years and the results support this decision (Famagusta Nautical
  Club, Limassol). The stakeholders accepted this proposal and new plans for combating
  erosion are now under implementation.<br>
  <b><br>
  Lessons Learned</b><br>
  It is very important to have Shoreline Management plans for coastal areas under
  rapid development. Over the last three years, these plans helped Cyprus to control
  coastal development. However, decisions on implementing appropriate technological
  solutions can take time. Knowledge of local conditions proved important. Thus,
  setting up an efficient monitoring system is necessary. This case study also
  illustrates the importance of using local expertise for decisions on appropriate
  solutions. The approach adopted in this case involved all stakeholders in the
  process of decision making which proved to be very efficient and flexible. <br>
