<h3>14.5.1 Role of International Agencies</h3>
<p>Awareness of the multisectoral interactions that influence human health has
  recently induced many international agencies to address health issues, in addition
  to the World Health Organization, UNICEF and other UN agencies that have an
  explicit health mandate. The World Bank has taken a leading role in international
  health policy through providing loans for health sector reform in developing
  countries and CEIT (Walt, 1994, 1998; World Bank, 1993). There are also many
  health and welfare-related NGOs that operate at the international level. Many
  international agencies play an important role in disaster and humanitarian relief,
  such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,
  the UN High Commission for Refugees, WHO, and international disaster relief
  agencies. UNESCO supports the education sector in member states and has an important
  role in supporting climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>
<p>The specialised agencies of the United Nations are primarily mandated to support
  government planning and management in Member States, by strengthening sectors
  such as industry, health and agriculture. These agencies also play an important
  role in assisting countries to apply internationally-agreed rules and regulations,
  and quality standards. Accordingly, these agencies consider that technology
  transfer, as it is broadly defined, should principally serve the needs of Member
  States regarding selection and implementation of mitigation and adaptive measures
  for the impacts of global climate change. </p>
<p>A collaborative programme on climate and human health, tentatively defined
  by WHO, WMO and UNEP, has been approved by the Interagency Committee for the
  Climate Agenda (IACCA). Execution of this programme is entrusted to WHO as part
  of its newly defined programme on Sustainable Development and Healthy Environments
  (SDE). Depending on the availability of resources, it is foreseen that WHO in
  collaboration with UNEP and WMO will: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
    <li> assist capacity building in Member States, in order to promote vulnerability
      assessment, adaptation strategies, and the adoption of technologies to promote
      health and reduce GHG emissions; </li>
    <li> exchange and provide information on the health impacts of climate change
      and variability and of mitigation strategies, as well as effective approaches
      to adaptation;</li>
    <li> promote research on the above topics.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Nations have both abilities and responsibilities, resources and needs. There
  will be benefit in sharing and networking, and in working within the framework
  provided by WHO and other international agencies.</p>
