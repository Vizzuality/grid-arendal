<h1>Case Study 24</h1>
<p> <b>Financing Micro-hydro Energy Dissemination in Per&uacute;</b><br>

  <b>Keywords</b>: Peru, micro-hydro, financial mechanisms, dissemination, clean
  energy, replication potential<br>
  <br>
  <b>Summary</b><br>
  This case study describes an experience of dissemination of micro-hydro plants
  in isolated rural areas in Peru, based on the provision of soft loans plus technical
  assistance. A total of 15 plants are being installed and a Revolving Fund has
  been established. The micro-hydro plants replace fossil fuel-based energy generation,
  and have an expected life of 25 years.<br>
  <b><br>
  Background</b><br>
  Only about 5 % of the rural population in Per&uacute; has access to electricity.
  For the remaining 95 % the main alternative -if available- is the use of diesel
  stand-alone generators that are usually unreliable and very dirty. There are
  no financial mechanisms available to facilitate or promote the investment in
  small renewable energy schemes in the rural areas. Local technology on small
  hydro energy has also had a poor reputation and considered to be expensive.
  ITDG, an international technical NGO, has been promoting the dissemination of
  micro-hydro energy in Peru during the last 20 years. For this purpose an integrated
  approach has been developed, including technology development, training, pilot
  projects, research on institutional issues and advocacy work. One of the elements
  of this approach was the creation, with support of the IDB, of a financial mechanism
  to facilitate access to funds for small micro-hydro plants to the rural population.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Approach</b><br>
  The IDB provided US$ 520,000 as a loan to ITDG. This loan had two components:</p>
<ol>
  <li> US$ 400,000 to be allocated as small credits up to US$ 30,000 at an interest
    rate of 8 % annually and maximum 5 years payback time. Clients should be rural
    entrepreneurs or local institutions (municipalities, communities, cooperatives)</li>
  <li> US$ 120,000 as a grant, for the provision of technical support, including
    promotion, technical and financial assistance, beneficiary organisation and
    implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p> A small local consultant group was hired for financial studies, preparation
  of credit instruments, control of expenditures during the implementation time
  and recovery of loans. Technical assistance (introducing low-cost technologies),
  promotion of credits and training of the users were the responsibility of ITDG.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Impacts</b><br>
  15 small hydro plants were installed by late 1997, allocating US$ 465,000. In
  addition to this sum, US$ 1.4 million co-funding has been raised for the same
  purpose from various sources, the most important ones being the regional government
  and the national poverty-focused programme FONCODES. Loans repayment is going
  well with an average delay of 2.5%. The 15 plants provide access to electricity
  for about 1,800 people; lead to the creation of small industries such as carpentry,
  welding, battery charging; and improve basic services such as light for evening
  education, health posts, communication services, etc. The project provided an
  alternative to the diesel option, reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
  Total installed power of 602 kW will be added to the national power capacity.
  The expected life of each plant is 25 years. Currently this is the only existing
  scheme of this type in Per&uacute;.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  It is possible to disseminate the option of clean micro-hydro electricity for
  isolated rural populations using appropriately designed financial mechanisms.
  A combination of credit, subsidised promotion and technical assistance seems
  necessary. Also, very close contact with the population in order to promote
  and market the scheme is required. Significant cost reduction can be obtained
  using less expensive but reliable technology.<br>
