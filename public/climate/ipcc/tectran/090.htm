<h1>4.13 Conclusions</h1>
<p> The discussion in this chapter on an enabling environment for technology transfer
  has produced several conclusions:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Governments can review whether their combination of laws concerning foreign
    investment, taxes, potential market growth and corruption would induce a firm
    to risk investment. Bureaucratic screening procedures, performance requirements
    and asset insecurity also act as barriers to foreign investment and could
    be addressed by policy changes that aim to attract foreign capital and technology.</li>
  <li> Governments can devise participatory mechanisms and adopt processes which
    can harness the networks, skills and knowledge of community groups and non-governmental
    organisations to better meet user needs, avoid delays and achieve greater
    success with technology transfer.</li>
  <li> Capacity-building is required at all stages in the process of technology
    transfer. It is a slow and complex process to which long-term commitments
    must be made for resources and to which the host country must also be committed
    if results are to bear fruit. Fundamental change requires an autonomous capacity
    to innovate, acquire and adapt technologies. Specific needs are for additional
    resources at the assessment and repetition stages: (a) to ensure there is
    a broad national commitment to environmentally sound technologies and that
    those most appropriate for national circumstances are selected; and (b) to
    ensure that indigenous capacity for ongoing innovation is developed to encourage
    North-North, South-North and South-South flows. For adaptation there is a
    need to strengthen scientific expertise and institutions capable of undertaking
    the relevant assessments; to promote linkages with this infrastructure to
    other parts of the public and private sectors; and to identify relevant tools
    and techniques to produce outputs for nationally determined priorities. </li>
  <li> Fundamental social structures and personal values (i.e., social factors)
    evolve along with a society's physical infrastructure, private and public
    institutions, and the technologies embodied within them. New (climate friendlier)
    technological trajectories for an economy can provide great opportunities.
    Governments can support the establishment of dynamic flexible learning mechanisms
    within the private sector and with the rest of civil society, not only at
    national level -- national systems of innovation, but also at a level of sub-national
    region -'the learning region.' </li>
  <li> A market transformation approach promotes replicable, ongoing technology
    transfers rather than one-time transfers. In such an approach, public policy
    can consider what are the set of institutions which underlie markets and what
    are appropriate public interventions to shape those institutions. It is useful
    to consider a broad brush of measures within a market transformation approach
    such as: technology adaptation, the need for enterprise-technological capability,
    subsidies, consumer education, and marketing.</li>
  <li> To reduce contract risk, property risk, and regulatory risks, particularly
    in private-sector-driven pathways, governments can strengthen national legal
    institutions for intellectual property protection; strengthen administrative
    and law processes to assure transparency, participation in regulatory policy-making,
    and independent review; and strengthen legal institutions to reduce risks.</li>
  <li> Governments can work with the private sector and establish codes, standards
    and labels. This provides a framework which can work to the benefit of industry
    and consumers. This route can help build markets for dispersed, small-scale
    technologies where technologies are diverse, vendors are many, and consumers
    face high risks in evaluating and selecting technologies and suppliers. Codes
    and standards also provide a means for representing the interests (i.e., to
    cost-effective levels of efficiency) of end-users who are absent from purchasing
    or construction decisions. Standards also allow consumers to be less knowledgeable
    about the equipment they are purchasing. </li>
  <li> The principle of cost-effective reduction should not be uncritically applied
    in all cases, but rather each technology transfer case, whether government
    to government, private sector to private sector or community to community
    should be examined on a case by case basis to see what the social impacts
    will be and whether these are unavoidable or can be reduced. Governments may
    wish to develop criteria for ensuring that technology transfer projects do
    not disempower or negatively influence weaker social groups in a society.
    Such guidelines could draw from guidelines on integrating gender issues in
    technology development .</li>
  <li> The experience in agriculture, forestry, and use of other natural resources
    has shown that the successful introduction of new technologies or modification
    of resource use often depends on a recognition of the existing forms of property
    rights, or on taking steps to create an optimal property rights regime. With
    an understanding of the existing - legal and actual - forms of property rights,
    technologies or modified resource uses can be adapted to fit the property
    relations. If property issues are taken into account, those introducing new
    technologies or proposing modifications in land or resource use can be more
    assured of the support of the target populations or groups.</li>
  <li> Governments have been investing for three decades in RTD for environmentally
    sound energy technologies in the energy sector, often working with the private
    sector. There may be a case for seeing whether results from these processes
    have been used and disseminated sufficiently. Developing countries' RTD efforts
    are often adaptive, following externally developed technology, suggesting
    the need for additional resources to develop indigenous innovative capacity.
    RTD and the process of innovation are closely linked, but innovation has been
    found to fail at the level of capability-the ability to focus specific sets
    of resources in a particular way (<i>e.g.,</i> financial management, marketing,
    understanding user needs, <i>etc.</i>)-rather than because of inadequate resources
    or hardware. The process of dissemination depends closely on influencing key
    opinion formers, at government-departmental level, industry level, firm level
    or community level. </li>
