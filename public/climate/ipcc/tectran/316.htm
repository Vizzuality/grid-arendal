<h3> 15.7.2 Possible Approaches to Promote Technology Transfer</h3>

<p>The barriers identified above will not be overcome overnight. Many relate to
  fundamental and intrinsic characteristics and principles of today's society.
  Adjusting the process of technology transfer to accommodate societal imperfections
  will be easier to accomplish than the reverse. There are a number of important
  opportunities to promote technology transfer for coastal adaptation. All relevant
  stakeholders identified in this chapter have important responsibilities to seize
  these opportunities. Each of them has specific roles in technology transfer,
  but generally, neither of them can trigger all steps involved. It is therefore
  essential that there is true collaboration and interaction amongst all stakeholders.
  All stakeholders' interests must be known and considered to prevent the transfer
  of inappropriate technology, including technology that is culturally or socially
  unacceptable or cannot be operated or maintained using local expertise. Already
  in the project-formulation stage, it is crucial to consult and involve local
  experts.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="003.htm">Chapter 1</a> provided four questions that reinterpret the
  issues raised by the fourth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations
  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC CoP-4) in the Annex to its Decision
  4/CP.4 (see <a href="007.htm#b11">Box 1.1</a> in <a href="003.htm">Chapter 1</a> for all questions). The
  four questions can be summarised as:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> How can a receptive environment for technology transfer be created?</li>
  <li> What additional bilateral and multilateral efforts are needed, if any?</li>
  <li> What steps can be taken by Annex II Parties?</li>
  <li> What additional role can the private sector play?</li>
</ul>
<p> The number and magnitude of ongoing coastal infrastructural projects suggest
  that coastal planners and managers are already receptive to technology transfer
  of a particular kind. However, there is a need to proceed from single transactions
  involving only hardware to long-term partnerships that also concentrate on enhancing
  human capacity by providing technical assistance and in-situ training. Moreover,
  awareness that protection is often not the most appropriate strategy to adapt
  to climate change is growing, but it remains difficult for coastal planners
  to oversee the entire spectrum of available options. The establishment of a
  clearinghouse for coastal-adaptation technologies could facilitate the task
  of technology selection and evaluation. Such a clearinghouse would develop and
  hold an extensive catalogue of available technologies, including information
  on their costs, performance, owner (if not publicly owned), availability, implementation
  requirements and other relevant issues.<br>
  <br>
  Addressing the prevalent barriers does not require setting up new bilateral
  and multilateral institutions or mechanisms. Instead, existing activities and
  institutions need to be refocused to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
  of coastal technology transfer, taking climate change into account. Technology
  transfer will be served by regional collaboration, especially when it concerns
  countries that do not have the necessary human or financial resources to develop
  or manage large projects independently. Examples of successful projects involving
  technology transfer that are the result of regional collaborations are PICCAP
  and CPACC. Primarily aimed at information development, these projects recognise
  that effective coastal adaptation and related technology transfer require a
  better understanding of local adaptation needs.<br>
  <br>
  Annex II Parties have an important responsibility to facilitate coastal adaptation
  in vulnerable countries. Many donors have traditionally attached a higher priority
  to projects aimed at mitigating climate change than to adaptation projects.
  The UNFCCC CoP-4, however, decided that activities directed at the preparation
  of adaptation activities are now eligible for funding by the GEF. This decision,
  along with the pressing need for adaptation, may stimulate other donors to revisit
  their priorities. For most locations, there is no need to invest in the development
  of new technologies. Rather, the evaluation, adjustment and repetition of existing
  technologies need to be stimulated. Annex II Parties may also promote the establishment
  of collaborative mechanisms for technology transfer.<br>
  <br>
  The private sector may be able to extend its role in technology transfer when
  provided with the right incentives. These incentives would tend to increase
  the profitability of socially desirable technology-transfer projects and could
  include subsidies for investment and tax exemptions of income. The role of the
  private sector may also be extended by regulation. In transnational technology
  transfer, for example, the home company could be required to involve a partner
  company in the host country. Finally, professional organisations can stimulate
  private-sector involvement by lobbying and engaging in relevant networks.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, in a Special Report that discusses the methodological and technological
  issues involved in technology transfer one might lose sight of the fact that
  technology by itself is not a panacea. Coastal-adaptation technologies can provide
  an important contribution to the sustainable development in coastal zones, but
  their effectiveness depends strongly on the economic, institutional, legal and
  socio-cultural contexts in which they are implemented. Furthermore, climate
  change is but one of the many interacting stresses in coastal zones. The importance
  of controlling non-climate stresses in the quest to reduce coastal vulnerability
  to climate change must not be underestimated. </p>
