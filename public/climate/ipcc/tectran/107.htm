<h3>5.4.3 Small- and Medium-Size Enterprises</h3>
<p> Many of the incentives to embody best practice (in both capital equipment
  and in the products produced) that exist in multinational corporations also
  exist in small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). Indeed, SMEs can be highly
  innovative and competitive. But organisational difficulties and the lack of
  scale economies can diminish the ability of SMEs to make the best economic and
  environmental decisions (Lin See-Yan, 1997). Even if an SME in a developing
  country understands (or receives a policy signal) that it would be a good choice
  to invest in environmentally sound technology, it may still fail to do so simply
  because of a lack of information, skilled personnel or financial resources (see
  <a href="107.htm#b54a">Box 5.4a</a> for the example of SMEs in China and <a href="107.htm#b54b">Box
  5.4b</a> for Thailand). <br>
  <br>
  SMEs may also face additional barriers to technology adoption because of language
  differences or a lack of scientific and technical training on the part of their
  personnel. Even though much of the current stock of technical knowledge is available
  in the open scientific and engineering literature, this literature is not easily
  accessible in all parts of the world.<br>
  <br>
  This last possibility illustrates that SMEs may be handicapped by the lack of
  infrastructure. The emission-reducing benefits of cogeneration in manufacturing
  cannot be obtained if there is no hook-up to the electrical grid, or if the
  scope and stability of the grid is limited so that there is no steady demand
  for cogenerated power. Absence of adequate infrastructure may place an additional
  constraint on technology choice that leads to less energy-efficient methods
  being chosen, as when, for example, production techniques have to be designed
  to work around the likelihood of power outages or brownouts.<br>

      <p>Small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) in China consist of community
	enterprises (mainly owned by townships and villages), multiple cooperative
	enterprises, joint ventures, and individual and private enterprises. SMEs
	produce a significant share of China's GDP in a number of industrial sectors.
	In 1995, there were about 22 million SMEs in China employing 129 million
	people. SMEs in China face a number of constraints to engaging in technology
	transfer, such as for producing more energy-efficient products or investing
	in more-energy-efficient processes, including:</p>
      <p><i>Information.</i> SMEs lack contact with technology manufacturers and
	customers so information about technology availability and customer demands
	is lacking. The evolution of industrial SMEs from non-sector-specific
	commune-based enterprises made SME rely on low-grade technologies and
	gave them little access to formal information and training channels. SMEs
	learn largely by visiting and copying other firms in the same sector.
	This constraint on information acquisition is especially true of what
	might be called organisational technologies such as project analysis,
	financial methods, or studies of market developments and factor price
	forecasts. SMEs have limited interchange with government ministries that
	might be in a position to advise them on technology choices. </p>
      <p><i>Rural customer demand.</i> Rural customers show little appreciation
	for product quality (such as energy-efficiency). Competition is based
	solely on price and regulatory initiatives to promote product quality
	do not exist. In cases where some product quality standards do exist (i.e.,
	minimum heat efficiency of bricks), they are usually not enforced. Even
	when customers do appreciate quality, they are often not able to pay for
	higher up-front capital expenditures because of severe capital constraints.
	And there are usually few marketing activities or product labelling initiatives
	to better inform customers, and encourage them to distinguish between
	higher quality products and lower quality products.</p>
      <p><i>Financing.</i> SMEs do not possess the financial means to invest in
	more advanced technologies. On the other end, technology manufacturers
	are not in the position and other intermediaries do not exist to provide
	financial mechanisms encouraging technology supply push. Financial institutions
	are reluctant to lend for such investments to SMEs.</p>
      <p><i>Market competition:</i> SMEs face little competitive pressure in their
	rural markets. All local producers operate under the control of the SMEs
	and local markets are highly segregated. SMEs are integrated into a spatial
	network of enterprises supplying largely to local markets and not in a
	product oriented network. For this reason, inter-local distribution networks
	are weak or not existing, and opportunities to exploit existing economics
	of scale in production are limited. Product pricing is somewhat arbitrary
	and an SME is not driven out of the market when its profitability is too
	low. So far, SMEs have no experience with market/competition based regulation.</p>

      <p>SMEs are the real backbone of the Thai economy. A major barrier in transferring
	environmentally sound technologies to SMEs is insufficient financial resources.
	However, the difficulty in improving technology transfer capacity is not
	merely a financial problem. To prop up Thailand's industrial strength
	in the long run, Thailand has to modernise SME management and international
	marketing, and enhance industrial science and technology capability and
	labour skills.This means that:</p>
      <p>(1) Government policies for restructuring Thai industries, including
	SMEs, need to be spelled out more clearly. Even though SME assistance
	programmes have been launched recently, resource allocation and priorities
	are not well managed and cannot efficiently meet the needs of SMEs.</p>
      <p>(2) SMEs' pool of skilled personnel and ability to attract skilled R&amp;D
	staff are still comparatively weak and must be strengthened. Academia-industry
	linkages that target SMEs would be one potential remedy.<br>
	<br>
	(3) The application of voluntary environmental management in SMEs is urgently
	needed. Good examples are the implementation of ISO 14000 standards for
	medium-scale industries and the promotion of cleaner production to enhance
	competitiveness and environmental sustainability. It is necessary that
	the adoption of the environmentally sound technology transfer be on a
	&quot;willingness to accept&quot; basis.</p>
