<h3>5.6.3 Energy Service Companies</h3>
<p> Energy service companies (ESCOs) are a specific form of technology intermediary
  that has gained widespread acceptance in developed and developing countries
  and countries in transition. Due to the previously discussed barriers to conventional
  financing, innovative financing schemes are needed. A financing scheme is a
  particular institutional arrangement that determines who pays what to whom and
  who bears the risks of the transaction(s). An energy service company &quot;ESCO&quot;
  addresses the financial capability, and other institutional market issues. An
  ESCO is a company that offers energy services to customers with performance
  guarantees. Typical performance contracting arrangements provide customers with
  feasible means of improving their competitiveness by reducing energy consumption
  costs. Additionally, companies' cash flows are enhanced, which add value to
  their financial worth. <br>
  <br>
  Historically, ESCOs evolved in three broad categories as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Technology based (technology suppliers).</li>
  <li> Financial and legally based, with sub-contracting for the technical aspects
    of projects</li>
  <li> Technically based such as engineering consultancy firms</li>
</ul>
<p> Two common ESCO approaches in the United States are guaranteed savings and
  shared savings approaches. In the guaranteed savings structure, the end-user
  finances the project's initial investment costs from a third financier and,
  in turn, the ESCO guarantees that the energy savings will at least cover the
  debt services. Then the ESCO receives a share of the net savings after debt
  services and the operations and maintenance costs. However, if the savings fall
  short of the customer's financial obligations as stated in the performance contract
  the ESCO assumes the shortfall. In this respect, the ESCO assumes all the risks
  associated with the project's performance and the third party financier assumes
  the end-user's credit risk. In the second approach, the shared savings structure,
  the ESCO finances the project's initial investment costs, usually by borrowing
  from a third party financier. In turn, the ESCO is compensated by a higher share
  of the project savings. Given the current market situation in most of the developing
  countries, ESCOs are most likely to evolve in one of the following forms:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Local engineering consultancy firms expanding their portfolio of services
    to include energy efficiency as one of their activities.</li>
  <li> Local engineering consultancy firms entering into joint ventures with foreign
    technical partners.</li>
  <li> Local equipment suppliers expanding their services to include energy efficiency
    services.</li>
  <li> Financial and legal firms creating specific companies for this purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p> ESCOs have been successful in many developed countries, in particular the
  United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia and Brazil. However,
  the risks and the absence of clear success in developing countries are still
  issues. While there have been one or two successes in the former communist countries
  with specific injection of bilateral grant funds, the ESCO concept is still
  emerging. Nevertheless, energy service companies are operating or being formed
  in several developing countries and countries in transition, including Brazil,
  Mexico, China, Thailand, India, Russia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic (see
  <a href="318.htm">Case Studies, Chapter 16</a>). With assistance from USAID, two
  or three ESCOs are now operating in India, with efforts underway to increase
  the number of operations as well as to sensitise the consumers to take advantage
  of the services provided by the ESCOs. A pilot project by the World Bank and
  the Global Environment Facility is pioneering parastatal ESCOs in China by developing
  standard contractual models, providing financing and technical assistance to
  a group of pilot government-owned ESCOs (which may be privatised over time),
  and disseminating information about energy efficiency measures to industry (World
  Bank, 1998).<br>
  <br>
  Energy service business associations have been recently formed in Egypt and
  Brazil. They represent groups of private companies offering energy efficiency
  products and services. Their members share the common goal of providing solutions
  that reduce energy costs, improve productivity, and enhance operating conditions
  of energy users. The associations will address current market barriers facing
  the energy service business community, and will provide a forum for energy efficiency
  development. Members of the associations include companies providing turn-key
  services as energy service companies (ESCOs), equipment vendors and service
  suppliers, support vendors such as legal firms and consultants, and other interested
  organisations.</p>
