<h1>2.3 Mechanisms for technology transfer </h1>
<h3>2.3.1 National systems of innovation</h3>
<p>In recent years it has become clear that technology intermediation is needed 
  to reduce barriers to technology transfer associated with information, management, 
  technology, and financing. Research on technology innovation also highlights 
  the role of intermediaries in the innovation process. They operate between users 
  and suppliers of technology and help to create the links within networks and 
  systems through bridging between institutions, encouraging interaction within 
  the system and assisting with undertaking search, evaluation and dissemination 
  tasks. They ensure that technological know-how is broadly dispersed within the 
  system and can provide a compensating mechanism for weaknesses or &quot;holes&quot; 
  in the system. The high value of technology intermediation is illustrated by 
  many of the case studies presented throughout the Report (see for instance <a href="514.htm#bts2">Box 
  TS2</a>).</p>
<p>Examples of technology intermediaries include specialised government agencies,
  energy-service companies, non-governmental organisations, university liaison
  departments, regional technology centres, research and technology organisations,
  electric power utilities, and cross-national networks. Non-governmental organisations
  in particular are playing a greater role in technology intermediation; for example,
  there are many cases where technology intermediation by non-governmental organisations
  played a key role in the success of particular technology transfer efforts for
  renewable energy.</p>
<p>The key lesson which can be learnt from the literature on technology intermediaries,
  is the importance of mechanisms in which actions are integrated to make them
  more effective. Technology transfers are influenced greatly by what have been
  called national systems of innovation--the institutional and organisational
  structures which support technological development and innovation. Governments
  can build or strengthen scientific and technical educational institutions and
  modify the form or operation of technology networks-the interrelated organisations
  generating, diffusing, and utilising technologies.</p>
<p>National systems of innovation (NSI) integrate the elements of capacity building,
  access to information and an enabling environment into a mechanism for EST transfer
  that adds up to more than the individual components. Subsystems and the quality
  of interconnections within them can successfully influence technology transfer.
  NSIs can be enhanced through partnerships sponsored by international consortia.
  Partnerships would be system oriented, encompass all stages of the transfer
  process, and ensure the participation of private and public stakeholders, including
  business, legal, financial and other service providers from developed and developing
  countries. </p>
<p>NSI activities may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Targeted capacity building, information access and training for public
    and private stakeholders and support for project preparation;</li>
  <li> Strengthening scientific and technical educational institutions in the
    context of technology needs;</li>
  <li> Collection and assessment of specific technical, commercial, financial
    and legal information;</li>
  <li> Identification and development of solutions to technical, financial, legal,
    policy and other barriers to wide deployment of ESTs;</li>
  <li> Technology assessment, promotion of prototypes, demonstration projects
    and extension services through linkages between manufacturers, producers and
    end users;</li>
  <li> Innovative financial mechanisms such as public/private sector partnerships
    and specialised credit facilities;</li>
  <li> Local and regional partnerships between different stakeholders for the 
    transfer, evaluation and adaptation to local conditions of ESTs (see for instance 
    the TCAPP example in <a href="517.htm#bts3">Box TS3</a>);</li>
  <li> Market intermediary organisations, such as Energy Service Companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>NSI offer a new solution to the challenge of technology transfer and offer
  a cost effective, flexible way of enhancing technology transfer. Governments
  and multinational organisations should consider developing programmes to support
  NSI activities, either individually or jointly.</p>
<p>Comprehensive approaches to technology transfer which incorporate many of the
  elements listed above are beginning to emerge on both a bilateral and multilateral
  basis. One such activity being conducted on a bilateral basis by the United
  States is the Technology Cooperation Agreement Pilot Project, known as TCAPP.
  A similar multilateral approach is being pursued by the Climate Technology Initiative
  (CTI), an activity undertaken by 23 developed country Parties and the European
  Commission in support of the UNFCCC. Both approaches utilize a bottom-up, collaborative
  process under which all relevant stakeholders are engaged to jointly determine
  the technology selection/practices and implementation path consistent with that
  country's/region's sustainable development goals for one or more sectors. These
  approaches require a mutual commitment to explore actions which focus on achieving
  climate and development benefits to the host country, with active participation
  of relevant government, non-government, community, and industry groups. Since
  the goal is to translate sectoral needs into functioning projects, consideration
  is given to how the projects might be best structured to encourage private sector
  investment, including the need for regulatory or other change within the country
  to foster an enabling environment.</p>

      <p>In 1997, the U.S. Government launched the Technology Co-operation Agreement
	Pilot Project (TCAPP) to provide a model for a collaborative approach
	to foster technology co-operation for climate change mitigation technologies.
	Under TCAPP, the Governments of Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, Mexico, and
	the Philippines are currently working with the private sector and bilateral
	and international donor organisations to attract private investment in
	clean energy technologies in their countries. Many other donor initiatives
	have also adopted similar collaborative approaches between country officials,
	businesses, and donors in fostering private investment. However, TCAPP
	is one of the few initiatives that has engaged climate change officials
	in this collaborative process to lead to actions that address both development
	needs and climate change goals. </p>
      <p>TCAPP has two basic phases of activities. In the first phase, the participating
	countries have developed technology co-operation frameworks that define
	their climate change technology co-operation priorities and the actions
	necessary to attract private investment in these priorities. These actions
	include efforts aimed at capturing immediate investment opportunities
	(e.g. issuance of investment solicitations, investment financing, business
	matchmaking and capacity building, etc.) and longer-term efforts to remove
	market barriers. In the second phase, TCAPP assists the country teams
	in securing the private sector, in-country, and donor participation and
	support necessary to successfully implement these actions. This second
	phase of activities includes two major types of activities: </p>
      <p>(1) Attracting direct private investment in immediate market opportunities.
	This includes helping the countries develop and issue investment solicitations
	for large-scale opportunities and business matchmaking and financing activities.
	TCAPP has established an international business network to help guide
	the design and implementation of these activities. </p>
      <p>(2) Securing support for actions to address market barriers. These actions
	range from business capacity building to policy reform. This includes
	development of domestic implementation plans for these actions and securing
	necessary donor support to assist with implementation of these plans.
	TCAPP assists the countries in preparing implementation plans and donor
	proposals and in matching country needs with donor programmes. </p>
