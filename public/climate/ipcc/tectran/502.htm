<h1>2. Increase the Flow; Improve the Quality </h1>
<p>Government actions can transform the conditions under which technology transfer
  takes place. The spread of proven ESTs that would diffuse through commercial
  transactions may be limited because of the barriers listed above. </p>
<p>The three major dimensions of making technology transfer more effective are
  capacity building, an enabling environment and mechanisms for technology transfer,
  all of which are discussed in more detail in the subsections below.</p>
<p><b>Building capacity </b><br>
  Capacity building is required at all stages in the process of technology transfer.
  Social structures and personal values evolve with a society's physical infrastructure,
  institutions, and the technologies embodied within them. New technological trajectories
  for an economy therefore imply new social challenges. This requires a capacity
  of people and organisations to continuously adapt to new circumstances and to
  acquire new skills. This applies both for mitigation and adaptation technologies.
  Comparatively little consideration has been given in a systematic way to what
  capacity building is required for adaptation to climate change. </p>
<p><i>Human capacity</i><br>
  Adequate human capacity is essential at every stage of every transfer process.
  The transfer of many ESTs demands a wide range of technical, business, management
  and regulatory skills. The availability of these skills locally can enhance
  the flow of international capital, helping to promote technology transfer.<br>
  <br>
  Developed country governments in particular can ensure that training and capacity
  building programmes they sponsor consider the full range of information, financial,
  legal, and business consulting and engineering services that technology transfer
  requires, as well as the local conditions under which these may be provided.
  This requires co-operation with local governments, institutions and stakeholders,
  commercial organisations and consumers/ users.</p>
<p>Developing country governments can build local capacities to gear them for
  technology transfer. Training and human resource development have been popular
  development assistance activities. Future approaches can be more effective by
  better stressing the integration of a total package of technology transfer,
  focusing less exclusively on developing technical skills and more on creating
  improved and accessible competence in associated services, organisational know-how,
  and regulatory management.</p>
<p><i>Organisational capacity</i><br>
  It is important to recognise the need for participatory approaches and to strengthen
  the networks in which diverse organisations contribute to technology transfer.
  In technology intensive economies, technology increasingly flows through private
  networks of information and assessment services, management consultants, financial
  firms, lawyers and accountants, and technical specialist groups. Local government
  agencies, consumer groups, industry associations and NGOs may ensure that technology
  meets local needs and demand. This organisational infrastructure can help reduce
  but will not eliminate risks arising from deficiencies in legal systems. Although
  many actions that facilitate the growth of such networks are already underway,
  initiatives of particular importance to EST transfer include: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Expansion of opportunities to develop firms for management consulting,
    accounting, energy service, law, investment and product rating, trade, publishing
    and provision for communication, access to and transfer of information, such
    as Internet services;</li>
  <li> Encouragement of industry associations, professional associations and user/consumer
    organisations;</li>
  <li> Participatory approaches to enable private actors, public agencies, NGOs
    and grassroots organisations to engage at all levels of environmental policy-making
    and project formulation;</li>
  <li> Where appropriate, decentralisation of governmental decision-making and
    authority, in relation to technology transfer, to effectively meet community
    needs.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Information assessment and monitoring capacity</i><br>
  Information access and assessment are essential to technology transfer. However,
  focussing too narrowly on information barriers while ignoring the later stages
  of the transfer process can be less productive. The roles of governments and
  private actors in technology assessment are changing. Private information networks
  are proliferating through specialised consulting and evaluation services and
  over the Internet. Increasing FDI also demonstrates that many ESTs can diffuse
  rapidly without direct government action. Governments in developing countries,
  developed countries, and countries with economies in transition may wish to
  consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Developing improved indicators and collecting data on availability, quality
    and flows of ESTs to improve monitoring of implementation;</li>
  <li> Developing technology performance benchmarks for ESTs to indicate the potential
    for technological improvements;</li>
  <li> Improving information systems and linking them to international or regional
    networks, through well-defined clearing houses (such as energy efficiency
    and renewable energy centres), information speciality firms, trade publications,
    electronic media, or NGOs and community groups.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Enabling environment and extra effort to enhance technology transfer</b><br>
  Governments, through inter alia sound economic policy and regulatory frameworks,
  transparency and political stability, can create an enabling environment for
  private and public sector technology transfers. Although many ESTs are in common
  use and could be diffused through commercial channels, their spread is hampered
  by risks such as those arising from weak legal protection and inadequate regulation
  in developed countries, developing countries and countries with economies in
  transition. But many technologies that can mitigate emissions or contribute
  to adaptation to climate change are not as yet commercially viable. Beyond an
  enabling environment, it will take extra efforts to develop and enhance the
  transfer of those potentially viable ESTs. The following actions could increase
  the flow of ESTs and improve its quality. </p>
<p>All governments may therefore wish to consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Enacting measures, including well-enforced regulations, taxes, codes, standards
    and removal of subsidies, to internalise the externalities to capture the
    environmental and social costs, and assist the replication of ESTs;</li>
  <li> Reforming legal systems. Uncertain, slow and expensive enforcement of contracts
    by national courts or international arbitration and insecure property rights
    can discourage investment. Reforming administrative law to reduce regulatory
    risk and ensuring that public regulation is accessible to stakeholders and
    subject to independent review;</li>
  <li> Protecting intellectual property rights and licenses in such a way that
    innovation is fostered, while avoiding misapplication, which may impede diffusion
    of ESTs;</li>
  <li> Encouraging financial reforms, competitive and open national capital markets,
    and international capital flows that support foreign direct investment. Governments
    can expand financial lending for ESTs through regulation that allows the design
    of specialised credit instruments, capital pools, and energy service companies;</li>
  <li> Simplifying and making transparent programme and project approval procedures
    and public procurement requirements;</li>
  <li> Promoting competitive and open markets for ESTs;</li>
  <li> Stimulating national markets for ESTs to facilitate economy of scale and
    other cost reducing practices;</li>
  <li> Encouraging multinational companies to show leadership and use the same
    standards for environmental performance wherever they operate;</li>
  <li> Creating awareness about products, processes and services that use ESTs
    through means such as eco-labelling, product standards, industry codes, and
    community education;</li>
  <li> Using legislation, enhancing transparency, and increasing participation
    by civil society to reduce corruption in conformity with international conventions.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Governments of developed countries and countries with economies in transitions
  may wish to consider: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Stimulating fair competition in EST markets by discouraging restrictive
    business practices;</li>
  <li> Reforming export credit, political risk insurance and other subsidies for
    the export of products or production processes to encourage foreign direct
    investment in ESTs;</li>
  <li> Developing environmental guidelines for export credit agencies to avoid
    a bias against, and promote the transfer of ESTs, and discourage the transfer
    of obsolete technologies;</li>
  <li> Reducing the use, as trade policy measures applied to ESTs, of tied aid;</li>
  <li> Developing modalities and/or policies to improve the transfer of ESTs that
    are in the public domain; </li>
  <li> Increasing public funding for R&amp;D in cleaner technologies to reflect
    the high rate of social return, and wherever possible, enhancing the flows
    of ESTs arising from their publicly funded R&amp;D programmes by entering
    into co-operation with developing countries in R&amp;D partnerships and international
    research institutions; </li>
  <li> Increasing flows of national and multilateral assistance, including funding,
    especially in programmes targeted to environmental technologies, including
    patent licensing of ESTs where appropriate. Attention should also be paid
    to supporting pathways for transfer of ESTs among developing countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Governments of developing countries may wish to consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Ensuring assessment of local technology needs and social impact of technologies
    so that transfer of and investment in ESTs meet local demands;</li>
  <li> Expanding R&amp;D programmes, aiming at development of ESTs particularly
    appropriate in developing countries and adaptations to local conditions; promoting
    complementary policies for ESTs;</li>
  <li> Improving pathways for technology transfer among developing countries through
    information regarding the performance of ESTs in developing countries, joint
    R&amp;D, demonstration programmes, and opening markets for ESTs;</li>
  <li> Developing physical and communications infrastructure to support private
    investments in ESTs and the operations of intermediary organisations providing
    information services;</li>
  <li> Improving the identification of specific barriers, needs and steps towards
    introduction of ESTs by consulting with priority stakeholders;</li>
  <li> Continuing to improve macro-economic stability to facilitate ESTs to be
    transferred.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Mechanisms for technology transfer</b><i><br>
  National Systems of Innovation</i><br>
  The literature shows that National Systems of Innovation (NSIs) which integrate
  the elements of capacity building, access to information and an enabling environment
  into comprehensive approaches to EST transfer add up to more than the individual
  components and support the creation of an innovation culture. Subsystems and
  the quality of interconnections within them can successfully influence technology
  transfer. The concept of NSIs can be enhanced through partnerships with international
  consortia. Partnerships would be system oriented, encompass all stages of the
  transfer process, and ensure the participation of private and public stakeholders,
  including business, legal, financial and other service providers from developed
  and developing countries. </p>
<p><i>NSI activities may include:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li> Targeted capacity building, information access, and training for public
    and private stakeholders and support for project preparation;</li>
  <li> Strengthening scientific and technical educational institutions in the
    context of technology needs;</li>
  <li> Collection and assessment of specific technical, commercial, financial
    and legal information;</li>
  <li> Identification and development of solutions to technical, financial, legal,
    policy and other barriers to wide deployment of ESTs;</li>
  <li> Technology assessment, promotion of prototypes, demonstration projects
    and extension services through linkages between manufacturers, producers and
    end users;</li>
  <li> Innovative financial mechanisms such as public/private sector partnerships
    and specialised credit facilities;</li>
  <li> Local and regional partnerships between different stakeholders for the
    transfer, evaluation and adaptation to local conditions of ESTs;</li>
  <li> Market intermediary organisations such as Energy Service Companies.</li>
</ul>
<p> <i>Official Development Assistance (ODA)</i><br>
  Official Development Assistance (ODA) is still significant for developing countries
  and successful transfers of ESTs. ODA can also assist the improvement of policy
  frameworks and take on long-term capacity building. There is increasing recognition
  that ODA can best be focused on mobilizing and multiplying additional financial
  resources.</p>
<p><i>Global Environment Facility</i><br>
  The Global Environment Facility, an operating entity of the UNFCCC Financial
  Mechanism, is a key multilateral institution for transfers of ESTs. Compared
  to the magnitude of the technology transfer challenge, these efforts are of
  modest scale, even when added to the contributions from bilateral development
  assistance. The GEF currently targets incremental, one-time investments in mitigation
  projects that test and demonstrate a variety of financing and institutional
  models for promoting technology diffusion thus contributing to a host country's
  ability to understand, absorb and diffuse technologies. GEF also supports capacity
  building projects for adaptation consistent with limitations currently imposed
  by Convention guidance. Continued effectiveness of GEF project funding for technology
  transfer may depend on factors such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Sustainability of market development and policy impacts achieved through
    GEF projects;</li>
  <li> Duplication of successful technology transfer models;</li>
  <li> Enhanced links with multilateral-bank and other financing of ESTs;</li>
  <li> Funding for development and licensing of ESTs;</li>
  <li> Co-ordination with other activities that support national systems of innovation
    and international technology partnerships; </li>
  <li> Attention to technology transfer among developing countries.</li>
</ul>
<p> <i>Multilateral Development Banks</i><br>
  Governments may use their leverage to direct the activities of multilateral
  development banks (MDBs) through their respective Boards and Councils in order
  to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Strengthen MDB programmes to account for the environmental consequences
    of their lending;</li>
  <li> Develop programmatic approaches to lending that remove institutional barriers
    and create enabling environments for private technology transfers;</li>
  <li> Encourage MDBs to participate in NSI partnerships.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>The Kyoto Protocol Mechanisms and the UNFCCC</i><br>
  The analysis of the literature on the Kyoto Protocol Mechanisms, based on the
  preliminary stage of development of the rules for these, suggests that if they
  are implemented, the Mechanisms may have potential to affect the transfer of
  ESTs. </p>
<p>The extent to which Article 4.5 of the UNFCCC has been implemented is being
  reviewed by the UNFCCC. Given this evolving process, the IPCC has not been able
  to assess this matter.</p>
