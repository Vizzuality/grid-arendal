<h3><b>5.5.5 Fiscal Measures: Tax Incentives and Guarantees</b></h3>
<p> Governments can take a number of fiscal actions to encourage the uptake of
  environmental technology. While these can be highly effective, it should be
  noted that in many cases these may be second best alternatives to more consistent
  measures to internalise environmental costs or remove subsidies, which may not
  be politically acceptable (essentially offsetting one subsidy with another).
  In other cases they may be useful to initiate a market, but should not become
  permanent features.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Investor tax incentives.</b> Governments can seek to encourage investment
  by supplying tax incentives for investors in certain types of companies or investments.
  One example is in the UK where private investors buying venture capital funds
  and new shares in unlisted businesses (not necessarily environmental) can partially
  offset the investment against income thus reducing tax liabilities. This has
  helped to encourage investors to put capital out into new technologies, although
  it has proved difficult to ensure that investors back the kind of risky investment
  the schemes are aimed at (rather than creatively packed less risky alternatives).
  An alternative approach has been taken in the Netherlands where the Government
  has given a tax-free status to returns on investments in approved environmental
  funds. These have succeeded in attracting substantial amounts of capital and
  in reducing the cost of finance for appropriate environmental projects. Perhaps
  most importantly they have helped encourage financial institutions to find and
  help develop new &quot;green projects&quot;. However, they do not provide risk
  capital, and there have been problems of definition. While such projects normally
  support domestic businesses and ventures, the Dutch government recently extended
  its investor tax incentives to the selected projects in developing countries,
  with the potential to support technology transfer. In theory, the sort of tax
  support given to domestic venture capital could also be extended to selective
  venture capital opportunities in developing countries which might be an effective
  way of encouraging appropriate technology transfer. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Capital expenditure tax incentives.</b> An effective way to encourage the
  uptake of new technology is by providing accelerated capital depreciation on
  certain equipment - in extreme cases all in the first year, or alternatively
  on a faster schedule than normally used. This has been used in a number of markets
  to help accelerate the uptake of renewable energy (California, India) and is
  currently being used in the Netherlands to encourage businesses to install certain
  types of environmental technology. One advantage of accelerated capital allowances
  is that they can usually be combined with leasing to provide an accessible and
  flexible sort of financing.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Loan guarantee schemes.</b> In order to help support new business development,
  a number of governments have introduced loan guarantee schemes to support domestic
  small business development. They consist of the central government guaranteeing
  loans made by domestic banks to the small business sector to encourage the development
  of that sector. In most cases only a partial guarantee is provided so the participating
  private sector banks have an incentive to lend prudently. Other organisations
  have introduced schemes more specifically targeted at lending for environmental
  projects (<i>e.g.,</i> the European Investment Bank). Such loan guarantees do
  depend on the existence of a strong, independent financial system.</p>
