<h1>Case Study 21</h1>
<p> <b>Concrete Armouring for the Coast - Government to Private Sector Technology
  Transfer</b><br>

  <b>Keywords</b>: breakwater concrete armouring, coastal protection, licensing,<br>
  <br>
  <b>Summary</b><br>
  In 1993, two researchers at a United States federal laboratory, the U.S. Army
  Engineers Waterways Experiment Station (WES), developed and patented a new design
  for breakwater concrete armouring. The transfer of this innovative technology
  followed the classical pathway by which national government-sponsored research
  and development may be adopted and applied by the international private sector.
  The significant features of this case were new government policy, which provided
  additional incentives for the government laboratory and the inventors to pursue
  commercialisation of their innovation, and the presence of a global market.
  <br>
  <b><br>
  Geographical Focus</b><br>
  The transfer pathway included government-to-government transfer within the U.S.
  Army Corps of Engineers (COE), but has focused intensively on transfer from
  government to the international private sector. Five companies are now permanent
  regional licensees covering North America, South America, Europe, Asia, the
  Far East, Japan, South Africa, and the Middle East. <br>
  <b><br>
  Background</b><br>
  The COE research programme established to investigate new design methods for
  concrete armour units funded the initial development and testing of this technology.
  This innovation has wide-ranging potential application, as there are sites worldwide
  in need of coastal protection for land, property, and life. However, for some,
  the cost of this type of technology is a prohibitive factor. While this technology
  has been shown to potentially cost less and be more reliable than other armouring
  technologies, the initial investment is still a consideration, especially for
  those countries with limited resources. Altogether, this innovative technology
  seems to hold great promise, while the case study provides an excellent example
  of a product, market, and policy coming together to provide an opportunity for
  the transfer of technology.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Approach</b><br>
  Research and development funding was provided exclusively by the Corps. Once
  testing was completed, technical presentations were made at coastal engineering
  conferences in Japan, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Spain, and local
  seminars were used to introduce the technology to prospective users. A U.S.
  patent was awarded in 1995, but the international patents were significantly
  more difficult for the patentees to obtain. By retaining an experienced international
  patent attorney, this obstacle was overcome. In the United States, the Federal
  Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA) made technology transfer a responsibility
  of all federal laboratory scientists, allowed laboratories to enter into CRADAs
  and negotiate licensing agreements, and established principles for royalty sharing
  for federal inventors and other incentives for the laboratories. The developers
  and WES took advantage of the FTTA and entered into a CRADA with a South African
  firm interested in using the armouring units for a project. Difficulties in
  construction and the substantial time required administering the agreements
  provided WES with the incentive to establish permanent licenses with a few select
  experienced private companies. The patentees continued to promote the technology
  during licensing negotiations and provided technical support to another CRADA
  partner as well as subsequent licensee projects. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Impacts</b><br>
  The application and promotion of the technology resulted in the unit being proposed
  and used worldwide very early in its patent life, which is particularly uncharacteristic
  for coastal protection structures. A significant feature in gaining the quick
  acceptance of this new civil engineering technology was that the researchers
  addressed their clients' anxiety risk by streamlining the usual &quot;chain-of-command&quot;
  responses, as provided by the FTTA. At this time, WES involvement in projects
  is limited, as the licensees have begun to actively promote the technology,
  conduct their own research, and administer all projects. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  It is important to note that much of the early technology transfer was done
  without specific government funding and was accomplished beyond the normal duties
  of the government researchers. However, the incentives provided by the FTTA
  have resulted in nearly US$1 million in engineering revenue, license fees, and
  royalties for the WES. In addition, the FTTA allowed the government inventors
  to share the royalty revenue. This provided motivation for the researchers to
  commit a great deal of personal time and energy to develop the product and an
  associated construction technique, and implement the technology transfer. It
  also provided incentive for WES to allow the researchers to perform this work.
  Without these types of incentives, technology transfer of this type would be
  much more difficult, or might require a completely different type of transfer
  pathway. <br>
