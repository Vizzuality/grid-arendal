<h3>9.4.2 Programmes and Policies for Technology Transfer </h3>
<p>In this section we will follow the steps in the transfer process, using experiences
  reported in the literature, as well as case studies (see <a href="178.htm#t93">Table 9.3</a>). 
  The steps
  we follow are assessment, agreement, implementation, evaluation and adaptation,
  and repetition. Various programmes try to lower the barriers simultaneously
  in some steps. A wide array of policies to increase the implementation rate
  of new technologies has been used and tested in the industrial sector in industrialised
  countries (Worrell et al., 1997), with varying success rates. We will not discuss
  general programmes and policies (e.g. taxation, subsidies, integrated resource
  planning, regulation and guidelines, voluntary programmes and information programmes;
  see <a href="051.htm">Chapter 4</a>), but rather concentrate on specific examples
  in the industrial sector, with an emphasis on developing countries' experiences.
  With respect to technology diffusion policies there is no single instrument
  to reduce barriers; instead, an integrated policy accounting for the characteristics
  of technologies, stakeholders and countries addressed is needed. Technology
  diffusion is also influenced by many parameters, including capital costs, resources,
  productivity and resource efficiency.</p>
<p><i>Assessment</i><br>
  Selection of technology is a crucial step in any technology transfer. Information
  programmes are designed to assist energy consumers in understanding and employing
  technologies and practices to use energy more efficiently. These programmes
  aim to increase consumers' awareness, acceptance, and use of particular technologies
  or utility energy conservation programmes. Examples of information programmes
  include educational brochures, hotlines, videos, audits, and design?assistance,
  energy use feedback and labelling programmes. Information needs are strongly
  determined by the situation of the actor. Therefore, successful programmes should
  be tailored to meet these needs. Surveys in Germany (Gruber and Brand, 1991)
  and the Netherlands (Velthuijsen, 1995) showed that trade literature, personal
  information from equipment manufacturers and exchange between colleagues are
  important information sources. In the United Kingdom, the &quot;Best Practice&quot;
  programme aims to improve information on energy efficient technologies, by demonstration
  projects, demonstrating technologies in various industrial environments and
  conditions, information dissemination and benchmarking (see <a href="116.htm">Section
  5.6</a> in <a href="092.htm">Chapter 5</a> on information dissemination through
  intermediaries). The programme has been effective in achieving cost-effective
  energy savings, and is now replicated in various countries (Collingwood and
  Goult, 1998). In developing countries and CEITs technology information is more
  difficult to obtain. The case studies in India (TERI,1997; Van Berkel,1998a),
  see <a href="178.htm#t93">Table 9.3</a>, show various efforts to organise technology
  users and to collect and distribute data. These efforts seem to be successful,
  and have even lead to the establishment of visions on technology development
  (TERI, 1997). In China, visions on technology needs have also been developed.

      <p>Information and methods to identify and assess opportunities for greenhouse
	gas emission abatement and energy efficiency are essential steps in the
	successful implementation of these practices and technologies. Energy
	audits for industries have been used as a tool to bridge this information
	gap. In India, energy audits for industry had a bad history, as historically
	these were often subsidised and provided at almost no cost. Often the
	quality of the audits was very low. Consequently, recommendations were
	seldom implemented by the recipient. The cooperation between Tata Energy
	Research Institute (TERI, New Delhi), India, and the German organisation
	for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) aims to strengthen the capabilities of
	the TERI Bangalore Centre, to provide energy audits for industry and to
	strengthen the capabilities to offer high quality advise to industry.
	The Indo-German project provided various forms of training, established
	an energy information centre, provided improved measuring instruments
	for energy audits, helped to re-organise the institution by building specialized
	teams for the various industrial sectors, and helped to establish South-South
	cooperation. The energy audit centre in Bangalore has established itself,
	now has nine years of experience in providing energy audits to industry
	in India, and has expanded from having eight to more than 25 energy experts.
	This has provided the critical mass for the success of the project. It
	is planned to replicate this process in other parts of India and other
	countries. Currently the Jordan-German Rational Use of Energy Project
	is an attempt to replicate the positive experiences from India, by twinning
	the Jordan RSS Institute with TERI (Menke, 1998).</p>

<p>Energy audit programmes are a more targeted type of information transaction
  than simple advertising. Industrial customers that received audits reduced their
  electricity use by an average of 2 to 8%, with the higher savings rates achieved
  when utilities followed up their initial recommendations with strong marketing,
  repeated follow?up visits, and financial incentives to implement the recommended
  measures (Nadel, 1990; Nadel, 1991; Oshima, 1998). Energy audit programmes exist
  in numerous developing countries, and an evaluation of programmes in 11 different
  countries found that on average 56% of the recommended measures were implemented
  by audit recipients (Nadel et al., 1991). The Indo-German energy audit project
  (see <a href="178.htm#b91">Box 9.1</a>) in Indian industries (Menke, 1998) confirms that 50-60% of the
  recommendations were implemented, resulting in energy savings of 5-15%. Moreover,
  energy auditing proved to be a viable self-sustaining business opportunity,
  as the Indian partner was well equipped and motivated.</p>
<p><i>Agreement and Implementation</i><br>
  Actual implementation of technologies and practices depends on the motivation
  of management and personnel, external driving forces, e.g. legislation and standard
  setting, economics (i.e. profitability), availability of financial and human
  resources, and other external driving forces (e.g. voluntary agreements). Environmental
  legislation can be a driving force in the adoption of new technologies, as evidenced
  by the case studies for India (TERI, 1997) and the process for uptake of environmental
  technologies in the U.S. (Clark, 1997). Energy prices often do not reflect the
  full costs of energy production. Higher energy prices can increase the implementation
  rate of efficient practices, as evidenced by the Russian case study (Avdiushin
  et al., 1997). Market deregulation can lead to higher energy prices in developing
  countries and CEITs (Worrell et al., 1997), although efficiency gains may lead
  to lower prices for some consumers. Small energy or carbon taxes have been implemented
  for small energy users (incl. industry) in Denmark and the Netherlands, but
  it is too early to evaluate the effect on GHG emissions. Energy intensive industries
  operating in export-oriented markets are often exempted from such taxation schemes.
  The Czech case study shows a scheme, somewhat similar to a &quot;feebate&quot;,
  where funds from pollution fines are used to finance pollution prevention projects
  (Marousek et al., 1998). </p>
<p>Direct subsidies and tax credits or other favourable tax treatments (to raise
  end-use energy efficiency) have been a traditional approach for promoting activities
  that are thought to be socially desirable. Incentive programmes need to be carefully
  justified to assure that social benefits exceed cost. Direct subsidies might
  also suffer from the &quot;free rider&quot; problem, where subsidies are used
  for investments that would be made anyway. Estimates of the share of &quot;free
  riders&quot; in Europe range from 50 to 80% (Farla and Blok, 1995), although
  evaluation is often difficult. An example of a financial incentive programme
  that has had a very large impact on energy efficiency is the energy conservation
  loan programme that China instituted in 1980. </p>
<p>This loan programme is the largest energy efficiency investment programme ever
  undertaken by any developing country, and currently commits 7% to 8% of total
  energy investment to efficiency, primarily in heavy industry. The programme
  not only funded projects that on average had a cost of conserved energy well
  below the cost of new supply, it also stimulated widespread adoption of efficient
  technologies beyond the relatively small pool of project fund recipients (Levine
  and Liu, 1990; Liu et al., 1994). The programme contributed to the remarkable
  decline in the energy intensity of China's economy. Since 1980 energy consumption
  has grown at an average rate of 4.8% per year (compared to 7.5% in the 1970s)
  while GDP has grown twice as fast (9.5% per year), mainly due to falling industrial
  sector energy intensity. Of the apparent intensity drop in industry in the 1980s,
  about 10% can be attributed directly to the efficiency investment programme
  (Sinton and Levine, 1994), and a larger amount from unsubsidised efficiency
  investments, efficiency improvements incidental to other investments, and housekeeping
  measures. Economic reforms in many countries opened China's economy, which has
  favoured growth of light industries over heavy industries. The industrial structure
  has thus changed remarkably, in favour of less energy intensive sectors (World
  Bank, 1997b).</p>
<p>New approaches to industrial energy efficiency improvement in industrialised
  countries include voluntary agreements (VA). A VA generally is a contract between
  the government (or another regulating agency) and a private company, association
  of companies, or other institution (VA and other forms of public-private partnerships
  are also discussed in <a href="108.htm">Section 5.5</a> of <a href="092.htm">Chapter
  5</a>). The content of the agreement may vary. The private partners may promise
  to attain a certain degree of energy efficiency improvement, emission reduction
  target, or at least try to do so. The government partner may promise to financially
  support this endeavour, or promise to refrain from other regulating activities.
  Various countries have adopted VAs directed at energy efficiency improvement
  (IEA, 1997). No thorough evaluations of VA schemes have been published yet.
  Experiences with early environmental VAs varied strongly - from successful actions
  to very limited impacts (Worrell et al., 1997). In some cases the result of
  a voluntary agreement may come close to those of regulation. Voluntary agreements
  can have some apparent advantages above regulation, in that they may be easier
  and faster to implement, and may lead to more cost-effective solutions. Some
  NICs, e.g. Korea, also consider the use of VAs (Kim, 1998), while the Global
  Semiconductor Partnership is an example of an international voluntary agreement
  by TNCs to reduce PFC emissions, to avoid regulation (Andersen, 1998a).</p>
<p><i>Evaluation and Adaptation</i><br>
  Every industrial facility is unique in the process equipment used, lay-out,
  resources used, and organisation. Translation from a generic technology level
  into practical solutions within a country, sector or individual plant is needed.
  In UNIDO's National Cleaner Production Programme, it was found that investors
  only accepted the results of a technology demonstration if these are generated
  in a situation similar to theirs (Van Berkel, 1998b). Among other activities,
  the &quot;Best Practice&quot; programme in the UK (and replicated in China (Dadi
  et al., 1997), Brazil, Australia and New Zealand) demonstrates a technology
  in different industrial applications. Various countries have subsidy programmes
  under which new applications of technologies are eligible. Unless the capacity
  to adapt technology to the specific circumstances is developed, either in industry
  or technical assistance providers, investments in clean and energy efficient
  technology will not be successful. </p>
<p><i>Repetition</i><br>
  Research and development can have various goals, depending on the barriers to
  be tackled to implement a technology. Blok et al. (1995) differentiate between
  technical development of a technology, improving the technology to reduce costs,
  and exploration and alleviation of barriers to the implementation of a technology.
  The challenge of climate change is to achieve substantial GHG emission reductions
  over time, which can only be reached by building (technological) capacity through
  sustained RD&amp;D efforts. Large potential efficiency improvements do exist
  in the long term (Blok et al., 1995). A recent US study (DOE, 1995) quotes many
  successes of energy RD&amp;D. There is consensus among economists that R&amp;D
  has a payback that is higher than many other investments, and the success of
  R&amp;D has been shown in fields like civilian aerospace, agriculture and electronics
  (Nelson, 1982). Still the private sector has a propensity to under invest in
  RD&amp;D, because it cannot appropriate the full benefits of RD&amp;D investments,
  due to &quot;free riders&quot; (Cohen and Noll, 1994). Companies will also under
  invest in RD&amp;D that reduces costs not reflected in market prices (Williams
  and Goldemberg, 1995), such as air pollution damages and climate change. The
  example of the Waste Minimisation Cycles in India (Van Berkel, 1998a) demonstrates
  further development of technologies to improve performance, through a network
  of industries from the same industry sector to reduce some of the barriers.
  The Brazilian Alcohol programme is an example of indigenous technology development.
  Although seen as expensive due to lower oil prices since 1986 (Oliveira, 1991;
  Weiss, 1990), it is seen as a success in the field of technology development.
  Development has decreased the production costs of alcohol considerably (Goldemberg
  and Macedo, 1994; Macedo, 1998). Copersucar, a cooperative of sugar and alcohol
  producers, operates a (leading) joint research centre for agricultural and technology
  development (Macedo, 1998), as well as training. The centre also maintains a
  benchmarking programme to monitor and improve performance among members.</p>
