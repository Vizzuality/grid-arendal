<h1>3.6 Technology Transfer and Kyoto Mechanisms </h1>
<p>The area in which the Kyoto Protocol itself may have greatest implications
  for technology transfer is in its establishment of the project based mechanisms,
  Joint Implementation (JI) (Article 6) and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
  (Article 12). These allow investments in projects that reduce or avoid emissions
  to generate emission credits (ERUs or CERs respectively), which may be used
  to contribute towards compliance by an Annex I Party. Features that distinguish
  these mechanisms from emissions trading are summarised in <a href="048.htm#t32">Table
  3.2</a>. This creates an incentive towards climate-friendly investments. In
  addition, the CDM specifies that a part of the proceeds shall be used to assist
  vulnerable developing countries adapt to the effects of climate change. In these
  respects, such mechanisms may offer significant contributions towards technology
  transfer. </p>

<p>The CDM, if well structured, could be a vehicle for transferring ESTs. Though
  no specific provision makes reference to technology transfer, a number of features
  make the CDM unique. First, the clean development mechanism invites Annex I
  Parties to work with developing countries to further sustainable development
  and the overall objectives of the Climate Convention. This is possible largely
  only by the transfer of ESTs. Assisting Annex I Parties to achieve their emission
  reduction obligations through a transfer of &quot;credits&quot; is another objective
  of the CDM.<br>
  Secondly, the CDM is project based. Certified emission reductions may be generated
  through the investment in concrete projects and based on measurable, certifiable
  emission performance. </p>
<p>Thirdly, the provisions for governance of the CDM are more specific than for
  the other mechanisms. The CDM is to be supervised by an executive board, which
  is likely to be a sub-group of Parties to the Protocol, perhaps with inputs
  from other constituencies. This will provide oversight and guidance to the implementation
  of the CDM. The Protocol also calls for independent auditing and verification
  of project activities. These provisions reveal an effort to ensure transparency
  and credibility in the final results, and the need for agreement on standardised
  procedures of performance on which to base certification. They make the design
  of the mechanism clearly multilateral in nature, involving decisions and consensus
  among multiple Parties.</p>
<p>Some initial ideas on the CDM are starting to emerge from a variety of new
  literature and exchanges that have taken place since Kyoto (Aslam 1998 a &amp;
  b; OECD, 1998a; 1999, Goldemberg, 1998, TERI 1998):</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>The CDM is a means to build trust and strengthen capacity.</b> It should
    strengthen working relations and understanding among partners, the private
    sector, non-governmental organisations, and governments at various levels
    to enhance technology cooperation. Project-based crediting should lead to
    tangible investments and development of local capacity to maintain the performance
    of these investments. These projects should incrementally assist developing
    countries to achieve multiple sustainable development objectives (economic
    development, improvement of local environmental quality, minimisation of risk
    to human health from local pollutants, and reduction of greenhouse gases).
    Careful project screening and selection, including host community decision-makers,
    will assist in multiple benefits for all participants. </li>
  <li> T<b>he need to design simple, unambiguous rules that ensure environmental
    performance in the context of sustainable development while also favouring
    investment.</b> The multilateral oversight and governance provisions of the
    mechanism, and the project basis of transactions, will raise the transaction
    costs of investment in CDM projects as compared to mitigation reduction through
    other more conventional means (e.g. local options or even within other Annex
    I countries). This increases the complexity of the transaction and removes
    a portion of the economic benefit that might otherwise be attained. Critical
    questions under this heading have to do with how to determine the emissions
    additionality of proposed projects as well as the baseline against which to
    assess performance and establish transferable &quot;credits&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p> <br>
  Much about the design and governance of the CDM remains to be resolved. One
  important distinction is between &quot;bilateral&quot; or &quot;portfolio&quot;
  approaches (<a href="048.htm#t33">Table 3.3</a>). The bilateral approach is
  closest to joint implementation programmes where the host country negotiates
  directly with the investor about the terms of the contract. The portfolio approach
  would allow host (developing) countries to advance bundles of possible projects
  that fit with their own sustainable development objectives. Some authors (Siniscalco,
  1998; Grubb <i>et. al.,</i> 1999) argue that both models will be needed, depending
  on the type of project involved. <br>

<p>
  A practical understanding of one way the CDM may relate to technology transfer
  may be found in looking at progress made to date by some countries in establishing
  technology priorities for investments likely to emerge under the Convention
  and the Protocol. The Indian government, for example, has identified three different
  types of technologies as priorities for CDM investment (TERI, 1998): grid-connected
  photovoltaics; advanced fuel cells; and biomass for power generation. With respect
  to baselines, the Indian government has also identified three types: increases
  in energy efficiency, renovation and modernisation; introduction of new technologies;
  and projects that are currently subject to government incentives and subsidies
  (hence additional). <br>
  <br>
  Presumably once a host country has its own vision of what sustainable development
  entails given its own national circumstances, it could develop broad guidance
  on types of CDM projects that would be acceptable to it. Such guidance could
  vary from country to country and possibly by region within a country, depending
  on a variety of different parameters (e.g. resource endowment, natural environment,
  geography, industrialisation, urbanisation and demographic trends).<br>
  <br>
  This guidance might resemble a national &quot;technology needs assessment,&quot;
  one of the ideas that has begun to emerge from discussions under the Convention
  on technology transfer (UNFCCC, 1998a and van Berkel et al., 1998). Once a country
  has established a vision of its needs for sustainable development and technology,
  practical guidance on project types could be developed to fit these objectives.
  A portfolio of projects could be offered to international investors, giving
  more control to host countries to ensure the value of CDM projects over time
  (Yamin, 1998).<br>
  <br>
  An international gathering hosted by the OECD offered some interesting perspectives
  and words of caution with respect to the CDM (OECD, 1999): Participants highlighted
  the potential role of the clean development mechanism for fostering climate-friendly
  technology cooperation and urged greater clarity on these issues. They also
  cautioned against the mechanism being used by investors to compete for the cheapest
  abatement projects, which could lead to uncoordinated and ultimately counter-productive
  efforts (OECD, 1998b).</p>
