<h1>3.5 Agriculture </h1>
<p>Agriculture is a world-wide critical strategic resource expected to double
  its production in 30 years to feed the world. Yet, agriculture is most directly
  affected by climate change through increased variability as well as temperature
  and moisture changes. Agriculture's adaptation to climate change will require
  new genetic stocks, improved irrigation efficiency, improved nutrient use efficiency
  and improved risk management and production management techniques. </p>
<p>Agriculture can contribute modestly to mitigation through carbon sequestration
  in soils. Emissions from manure can be turned into methane fuel. Methane from
  ruminants can be reduced through straw ammoniation and increased feed efficiency,
  and methane from rice paddies can be mitigated. Better nutrient management can
  reduce emissions of nitrous oxide. Agricultural soils can be managed to increase
  soil organic matter through improved tillage practices, and tillage agriculture
  can be concentrated on better soils, allowing marginal soils to be converted
  to grasslands or forests. Each of these mitigation opportunities, however, requires
  farmers to change existing practices, creating the need for technology transfer.</p>
<p>Adaptation to uncertainty such as climate change requires assembling a diverse
  portfolio of technologies and keeping the flexibility to transfer and adopt
  needed technology. However, small farms and related businesses are risk-averse
  and transfer of technology is also discouraged through lack of information;
  financial and human capital, transportation; temporary tenure; and unreliable
  equipment and supplies. These hindrances can rarely be surmounted unless it
  is evident that the transferred technology profitably solves a clearly identified
  problem.</p>
<p>Even though adaptation and mitigation options are clear, integrated options
  need consideration in technology transfer. These will meet the following criteria:
  based on development needs: operating at a desired capacity and adapting the
  technologies to local conditions. For example, technology transfer of fertiliser
  use, as a main source of GHG, is focused upon and must therefore be balanced
  by productivity needs and by abatement of GHG emissions.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of technology transfer in the agricultural sector in the
  context of climate change response strategies would depend to a great extent
  on the suitability of transferred technologies to the socio-economic and cultural
  context of the recipients, and on considering development, equity, and sustainability
  issues. This is particularly relevant when applied to North-South technology
  transfers in this sector.</p>
<p>Governments can create incentives for technology transfer through regulation
  and improving institutions, in particular if those incentives are directly influencing
  farmers. The following actions would make sense in this context:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Reducing and eliminating subsidies and market distortions that mask climate
    variability and climate change signals</li>
  <li> Improving or developing national agricultural information systems to produce
    to disseminate information on available state-of-the-art technologies and
    assist users in identifying their needs;</li>
  <li> Expansion of credit and savings schemes, to assist rural people to manage
    the increased variability in their environment;</li>
  <li> Encouraging free movement of knowledge and trained workers in order to
    expose farmers to innovative practices and taking action to make new patented
    technologies available to small farmers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The worry about the absence of protection for intellectual property might be
  the key barrier to more private sector involvement in Technology Transfer. So
  it is important to adopt stricter IPRs to encourage greater private investment
  in agricultural R&amp;D, and greater involvement in technology transfer to increase
  agricultural research funding. Many (particularly developed) countries have
  adopted stricter intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes for agrochemicals,
  agricultural machinery and biological innovations. A rationale for adopting
  stricter IPRs is to increase private appropriability of research benefits and
  to encourage greater private sector investment in agricultural R&amp;D and greater
  involvement in technology transfer. Although evidence from the United States
  suggests that increased plant variety protection has stimulated private R&amp;D
  and adoption of improved crop varieties, the issue of IPRs for genetic resources
  remains controversial. Particular areas of controversy are farmer and research
  exemptions to IPR protection, and whether and to what extent IPRs should be
  extended to developing countries. Recent theoretical literature suggests that
  there may be limits to how far IPRs should be extended internationally.</p>
<p>The success of a response to an actual climate demonstrates that necessary
  technology can be developed, transferred and adopted. A new rice variety was
  developed in Sierra Leone to exploit seasonal rain and require less pesticide.
  Once success of the variety became apparent, farmers themselves transferred
  it to others. This transfer demonstrates the success of a policy that responds
  to present needs, concentrates researchers, devises cheap technology, and promptly
  benefits farmers.</p>
<p>Some technologies will not be so easily transferred. Irrigation, a pre-eminent
  adaptation to climate, costs millions and requires communities to adopt unfamiliar
  crops and methods. Nations must deal with scarce water and environmental impacts,
  marshal capital to construct the dams and canals and assist in the marketing
  of new crops. Banks must extend credit to farmers. Research and training must
  be turned to irrigation design, new crops, water use efficiency and prevention
  of salinity. Only an integrated national effort that extends to the farm level
  succeeds.<br>
  <br>
  Centuries of experience, much of it governmental, have demonstrated the value
  of new plants and useful genes of established ones. Breeding, testing and demonstrating
  in the diverse locales and climates where farmers must cope with drought, pests,
  and different lengths of season have had high payoff and are essential for adaptation
  to climate change.</p>
<p>Education lies at the heart of technological transfer. The public role is pre-eminent
  and must be supported. Policies and programmes that rely on practical demonstration
  have proven the most effective. Private business can inform about technology
  in advertisements or demonstrate it at fairs. Governments have a role in monitoring
  claims and educating broadly. For example the &quot;training and visit&quot;
  transfer requires both training technicians and getting them into the field
  to educate farmers.</p>
<p>Although the transfer of new varieties proceeds quickly and easily, transferring
  systems of management requires persistence. For example, the United States established
  the Conservation Technology Information Center in 1982 to encourage conservation
  tillage. Great progress has been made, but after 17 years, adoption is still
  ongoing.</p>
<p>Uncertainties cloud the outlook for the transfer of agricultural technology.
  Because people transfer technology most readily to solve evident problems, the
  uncertainty of climate change hinders transfer. When, for example, climatologists
  assessing the climate for the next few years cannot agree whether it will be
  wetter or drier, no farmer is likely to invest in irrigation or drainage.</p>
<p><br>
  The main flow of technology transfer is from developed to developing countries
  dealing with climate change, which was emphasised by UNFCCC and The Kyoto Protocol.
  Some cases of existing agricultural technology transfer among developing countries,
  such as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
  and other multilateral systems, can be most helpful in assisting countries meet
  climate change if they are strengthened. International organisations and relevant
  developed countries can make great contributions by encouraging and supporting
  the technology transfer among developing countries. </p>
<p>Efforts to transfer technologies that address the following needs are important
  in addressing climate change:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Increase crop output per litre of irrigation water drawn;</li>
  <li> Increase demand for appropriate technology with incentives and awareness
    raising and insures the provision of reliable supplies and equipment that
    meet local situations and needs;</li>
  <li> Provide crops suited to warmer temperatures</li>
</ul>
