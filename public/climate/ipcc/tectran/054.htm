<h1>4.2 Policy Tools for Technology Transfer </h1>
<p>Policy tools for technology transfer can be used to overcome a variety of barriers
  to technology transfer. The United Nations (UNCTAD, 1990) saw the lack of indigenous
  technological capabilities, infrastructure and institutions as key barriers
  to developing countries conducting technology transfer:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[Developing countries] lack the strong knowledge base, integrated physical
    infrastructure and diversified economy required to weather shocks and recombine
    existing resources in new ways to adjust to what has become a continuous process
    of change. They also lack the institutional mechanisms and capabilities to
    perceive opportunities and constraints, and to translate these into effective
    policies for change. The financing and skills needed to innovate, to adapt
    and to diversify are also exceedingly rare in these countries. (p.3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many have recognised that barriers to technology transfer depend very much
  on the specific context in question:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The limiting factors for technological transformation are not primarily technological
    but are instead part of the social, economic, political, and cultural milieus
    in which technologies are developed, diffused, and used. Market incentives,
    the structure of regulations, the content and quality of research and education,
    and social values and preferences all determine technological trajectories.
    (Heaton et al., 1991, p. 21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Governments and international agencies have a variety of policy tools for overcoming
  key barriers to technology transfer (see <a href="054.htm#t41">Table 4.1</a>). Many of the barriers and
  tools are discussed broadly in this chapter and in <a href="092.htm">Chapter
  5</a>, while barriers and policy tools more specific to individual sectors are
  discussed in Section II of this report. In addition, direct government financial
  support for technology transfer (such as grants, subsidies, loans, provision
  of equipment or services, and loan guarantees), as well as indirect financial
  support for private-sector innovation, are discussed further in <a href="092.htm">Chapter
  5</a>.</p>
<p>Agenda 21, adopted in 1992, provided some of the earliest recommendations for
  public policies to promote technology transfer for environmental benefits (UN,
  1993). These recommendations reflect not only the need for hardware, but also
  for building associated local capacities and for providing market intermediation.
  Strategies outlined in Agenda 21 include: (a) information networks and clearinghouses
  that disseminate information and provide advice and training; (b) government
  policies creating favourable conditions for both public-sector and private-sector
  transfers; (c) institutional support and training for assessing, developing,
  and managing new technologies; (d) collaborative networks of technology research
  and demonstration centres; (e) international programmes for cooperation and
  assistance in R&amp;D and capacity building; (f) technology-assessment capabilities
  among international organisations; and (g) long-term collaborative arrangements
  between private businesses for foreign direct investment and joint ventures.
</p>
<p>In view of the considerable opportunities for action, some have argued for
  nothing less than a technological &quot;transformation&quot; towards more environmentally
  sustainable technologies (Heaton <i>et al.,</i> 1991). To promote such a transformation,
  successful technology transfer policies must make available financial resources,
  must reduce or eliminate barriers to technology transfer, must promote capacity
  building within developing countries, and must promote new forms of technology
  intermediation or &quot;technology brokering.&quot; Capacity building should
  target technology acquisition, skills development, and local policies and institutions
  to support the technology transfer process. Market intermediation should include
  matching technologies with applications, brokering partnerships, and facilitating
  negotiations and financing packages. </p>
<p>A new role for Governments has been identified where they play an integrating
  role in managing knowledge on an economy-wide basis by making technology and
  innovation policy an integral part of overall economic policy (OECD, 1999).
  It should be recognised that fundamental social structures and personal values
  (<i>i.e.,</i> social factors) evolve along with a society's physical infrastructure,
  private and public institutions, and the technologies embodied within them.
  New (climate friendlier) technological trajectories for an economy can provide
  great opportunities. Governments can support the establishment of dynamic flexible
  learning mechanisms within the private sector and with the rest of civil society.
  Private companies can create greater environmental awareness. Greater participation
  across society in the charting of technological trajectories, and in the use
  of the products of goods and services they generate go hand in hand with raising
  awareness through education and the media. </p>
