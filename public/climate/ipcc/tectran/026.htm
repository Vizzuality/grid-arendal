<h3>2.2.6 Foreign Portfolio Equity Investment and Venture Capital</h3>
<p><i>Issues</i><br>
  Foreign portfolio equity investment (FPEI) is distinguished from foreign direct
  investment by the investor's degree of management control (UNCTAD, 1998). Portfolio
  investors typically purchase shares in a company, often through a fund, without
  any intention of influencing management decisions. The investment horizon of
  portfolio investors is typically shorter, and the type of investor is more often
  a financial institution, institutional investor, or insurance company interested
  in the financial returns. Venture capital is a special type of long-term, high-risk
  finance with returns usually taken in the form of capital gains and fees rather
  than dividends (see <a href="103.htm">Section 5.3.3</a>). Venture capital is
  often focused on early-stage investment in technology-based companies. FPEI
  and venture capital primarily involve the private sector, although institutions
  such as the International Finance Corporation, Commonwealth Development Corporation,
  and U.S.-backed Overseas Private Investment Corporation have promoted venture
  capital funds in developing countries in an effort to &quot;improve the access
  of small and medium-sized companies to equity finance and management expertise&quot;
  (UNCTAD, 1998). FPEI's links to technology transfer are that it makes money
  available to companies in developing countries, which they in turn can use to
  purchase equipment and training.</p>
<p><i>FPEI and Venture Capital Trends</i><br>
  According to UNCTAD (1998), the capitalisation of stock markets in developing
  countries grew more than tenfold during the period 1986 to 1995, from $171 billion
  to more than $1.9 trillion (compared to US$13.2 trillion for the industrial
  economies). Much of the increase came from FPEI flowing into emerging markets
  in Latin America and Asia, although as with FDI the inward flows were concentrated
  on relatively few countries. The major factors behind the increased inflows
  were the liberalisation of stock markets in upper middle-income and large low-income
  developing countries, the globalisation of financial markets, and the concentration
  of financial resources in the hands of institutional investors, such as mutual
  and pension funds and insurance companies.</p>
<p>Overall, FPEI flows to developing countries have fluctuated more widely than
  FDI flows during the period 1986 to 1995 (UNCTAD, 1998), consistent with the
  shorter investment horizon of equity investors. After a steep rise, FPEI declined
  in 1998 because of the financial crisis in Asia, and because high returns in
  the U.S. market offered a more attractive alternative for many investors. Equity
  investment in developing countries in that year was US$12 billion, down from
  $38 billion in 1997 (OECD, 1999c). Foreign portfolio equity investment has provided
  large sums of money for the expansion of industry in a select group of developing
  countries, but its volatility suggests that it should be treated with caution
  when looked to for consistent, stable funding of technology transfer.</p>
<p>Venture capital is more common in the United States than in other OECD member
  countries. OECD governments invest an estimate $3 billion of risk finance per
  year in small, technology-based companies, while the private sector venture
  capital supply was estimated at US$100 billion in 1997 (OECD 1997c). It is not
  clear how much of this is directed at developing countries or climate-relevant
  technologies.</p>

    <td>Economic difficulties experienced by a number of Asian countries since
      mid-1997 initially caused great concern that they might spread throughout
      the world's financial system, leading in the worst scenarios to a global
      depression. In early 1998, the International Chamber of Commerce and the
      UNCTAD conducted a study of multinational corporations to determine what
      impacts the Asian financial crisis had had on their investment plans in
      that region. The survey covered 500 companies, including the world's largest
      MNCs in terms of foreign assets; the largest MNCs with origins in developing
      countries; and additional businesses with significant operations in Asia.
      Banking and finance companies were not surveyed. A total of 198 companies
      (40 per cent) responded.
      <p>What emerged from the survey is that foreign companies investing in Asia
	if anything saw the crisis as an opportunity to increase their investment
	in the region; their confidence in the region remained unchanged despite
	the turmoil. ICC and UNCTAD noted &quot;... most MNCs typically take a
	long-term view with respect to their locational decisions and, given the
	region's past performance and solid fundamentals in a number of respects,
	this leads them to remain bullish about FDI in Asia. ... Indeed, in the
	longer-term, the attractiveness of the region is likely to be enhanced
	as Asian countries overcome their problems and reassert their economic
	dynamism on the basis of improved fundamental strengths&quot; (ICC, 1998;
	OECD, 1998a).</p>
