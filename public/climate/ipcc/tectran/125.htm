<h1>6.3 Chapter Outline and Content</h1>
<p>The sectoral chapters in this section follow a common outline to the extent
  that this was feasible given the material that was reviewed for each chapter.
  The common outline is shown in <a href="125.htm#b61">Box 6.1</a>. The substantive material in each chapter
  will include a discussion of the relevant mitigation and adaptation technologies,
  but since the mitigation technologies, policies and measures are already discussed
  in the IPCC, 1996b report, and the adaptation technologies were addressed in
  the IPCC, 1996a report, the focus of this report will be on the barriers to
  the transfer of technologies within a country and between countries. To the
  extent technologies are not addressed in these IPCC reports, they are addressed
  in respective chapters. In addition, each chapter will discuss the policies,
  programmes, and measures that might be used to overcome these barriers.</p>

	<li><i> Executive summary</i> - Focuses on the role of governments and
	  UNFCC mechanisms to foster technology transfer. Highlights roles of
	  other essential actors.</li>
	<li> <i>Introduction </i>- Discusses current development patterns as a
	  context.</li>
	<li> <i>Climate mitigation and adaptation technologies</i> - This section
	  lists and describes technologies that are climate friendly and climate
	  safe with a near-term time horizon in the subjective chapter. To the
	  extent possible, it provides the costs and potential for reducing GHG
	  emissions when compared with baseline technologies (See IPCC Technical
	  Paper 1 (TP1) for list, description and GHG impacts (Watson et al.,
	  1996b); see also UNFCCC paper on adaptation for initial description.
	</li>
	<li> <i>Magnitude of current and future technology transfer using various
	  systems (pathway, process, stakeholder) and their limitations.</i> Estimates
	  the extent to which each transfer is comprised of mitigation and adaptation
	  technologies.</li>
	<li><i> Technology transfer within a country (includes a discussion of
	  barriers, evaluates with respect to criteria in 2 above, and draws on
	  case studies)</i> The primary focus of this section is on barriers and
	  the policies, programmes and measures to overcome them (see Section
	  1 for a list of generic barriers and policy tools). The discussion is
	  built around drivers/incentives, pathways, and stakeholders/actors.
	</li>
	<li> Technology transfer between countries (includes a discussion of barriers,
	  evaluates with respect to criteria in 2 above, and draws on case studies)
	  - The primary focus of this section is on barriers and the policies,
	  programmes and measures to overcome them. The discussion is built around
	  drivers/incentives, pathways, and stakeholders/actors. </li>
	<li> Lessons learnt from 5 and 6 above - This section discusses changes
	  in future technology transfer systems regarding interventions suggested
	  in 5 and 6. It also analyses options available to different actors to
	  change the current trajectory of technology transfer discussed in 4
	  above. It is organised by actors such as national governments, international
	  governmental organisations, non-governmental organisations, industry,
	  community organisations, etc.</li>

<p>The discussion in each chapter is to be organised primarily by barriers and
  policy tools, because these are felt to be common to each sector and are not
  expected to vary by each technology within a sector. Since the audience for
  each chapter will be the many actors engaged in influencing the discussions
  on climate change, each chapter concludes its discussion by organising the material
  by the roles that these actors could play in fostering the spread of technology.
  The material is then condensed in an executive summary focused towards government
  experts providing information or themselves engaged in the negotiations on climate
  change.</p>
<p>Some of the substantive material spans across sectoral boundaries. Bioenergy,
  for instance, gets treated in both the energy supply and forestry chapters from
  different perspectives. In the energy supply chapter, the focus is on the technologies
  used to convert biomass into energy, while that in forestry is more towards
  the growing of biomass for use in generating energy. Likewise, the spread of
  cook-stove technologies that use biomass is covered in the buildings chapter.
  Technology transfer for rural energy use is treated separately in the buildings
  chapter.</p>
<p>Another topic is the manufacture of mass-produced goods, such as refrigerators
  and motor vehicles, which could belong in the industry chapter or in the buildings
  and transportation chapters respectively. The literature on improving energy
  efficiency of refrigerators or motor vehicles, however, is largely in the buildings
  and transportation sectors, and thus it is appropriate to treat the material
  in the two respective chapters.</p>
