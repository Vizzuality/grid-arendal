<h3>8.2.4 Infrastructure and System Changes</h3>
<p>Travel trips and choice, and freight volume and modal choice can be affected
  by several factors such as urban density, transport infrastructure and the design
  of transport systems. Recent major innovations in infrastructure design such
  as linking urban transport to land-use patterns, zoning, increase access to
  jobs and shops, comprehensive and integrated planning strategies have lead to
  reduction of urban pollution with possible climate change benefits as they reduce
  the reliance on car (Newman and Kenworthy, 1989). Designing clusters under the
  mixed land model, where homes, jobs and stores are together reduces the trips
  significantly (ECMT/OECD, 1995). However, designing infrastructure to suit transport
  demands is difficult because of the multiple needs of the different transport
  modes. Also, an integrated strategy requires coordination between many stakeholders
  which is not always easy (Gakenheimer, 1993). </p>
<p>Traffic and fleet management aimed at reducing road congestion and increasing
  traffic flows for different modes is gaining prominence because energy savings
  up to 10% in urban areas can be achieved, resulting in reduction of GHG emissions.
  Advanced Traffic Control Systems (ATCS), which include well-designed and coordinated
  control systems, have led to improvements in many cities of developed countries
  such as Cambridge in UK, and Oslo and Bergen in Norway (OECD, 1995). Singapore
  is one of the few countries that have instituted several demand management measures
  aimed at reducing demand for cars and restraining car use. These include fitting
  smart cards on vehicles as a means of paying tolls and use of road sensors (Pezoa,
  1995), vehicle quota system based on traffic and electronic road pricing to
  reduce traffic jams in peak hours (Ang, 1996a) and the area licensing scheme
  that is continuously being reviewed (Ang, 1996b; see <a href="158.htm#b83">Box
  8.3</a>). Modal shifts from road to rail can yield energy savings of 0-50% resulting
  in GHG reductions and even higher in non-fossil fuel electricity powered electric
  trains, but these savings vary among regions and current trends of moving from
  rail to road travel can negate such benefits. </p>

    <td colspan="5">Many cities in fast developing countries are adversely affected
      by serious traffic congestion leading to increased travel time and fuel
      consumption, environmental degradation and productivity losses. Singapore
      is one of the few countries in the world that has adopted measures to moderate
      demand for cars and to restrain their use.
      <p>Singapore, a small and densely populated state, has being going through
	rapid economic development in the past 30 years resulting in significant
	increases in road transportation. The country embarked on land transport
	policy with technical, regulatory and policy measures to control transport
	growth. A recent white paper on transportation clearly identified two
	demand management measures that are aimed at reducing demand and use of
	cars. These are a vehicle quota system and a road pricing system. </p>
      <p>The vehicle quota system (VQS) was introduced in May 1, 1990 after several
	fiscal measures such as import duties, registration fees, and road taxes
	had been tried with very little success. As an example, purchase price
	of new cars increased by almost 200% in real terms between 1974 and 1990,
	but the car population doubled in the same period. Rising incomes was
	believed to have accounted for this growth and there was no indication
	that it will slow down by further increase in taxes. Hence, the VQS was
	designed to link vehicle population to road capacity. Vehicle registration
	is fixed by the government based on current traffic conditions and the
	market determines the vehicle price. It was applied to all vehicles except
	scheduled buses and school buses. New vehicles are put on a tender that
	is held in specific periods and cars can be used for a limited time without
	further taxes. Although the system is constantly under review to reduce
	its weaknesses, some changes have been achieved as shown in Table below.

    <td colspan="5">The Area Licensing Scheme (ALS) was introduced in 1975 to
      reduce traffic congestion in designated restricted zones in the city centre
      during peak hours. The scheme included components such as car-pooling and
      park-and-ride for weekdays. Special public buses for commuters and car parks
      were introduced for commuters, Area licenses were made available in convenient
      public outlets, and compliance was enforced. As a result of this scheme,
      the number of vehicles entering the restricted areas fell by a third and
      cars by 61%. In addition, commuters changed trip times and modal shift was
      observed with car owners moving to buses. Noise and air pollution was also
      reduced. Between 1975 and 1989, employment in the restricted zones grew
      by a third in size. With the introduction of the rail-based Rapid Transit,
      all vehicles had to pay ALS fees except public buses, motorcycles and essential
      vehicles; car pool exemption was banned; and evening ALS was introduced.
      Also in 1994, a whole ALS system was introduced that led to a reduction
      of traffic by about 9% and increase in traffic speed.
      <p>The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system was introduced to replace the
	ALS, which was a manual pricing system that had limited coverage after
	a lengthy process of design and evaluation, as this was the first such
	system in the world. In 1993, the government offered three multinational
	consortia to develop a prototype, which they did for about a year. After
	modifications and improvements on the designs, the ERP started in late
	1997. The system uses a smart card that is slotted into a unit attached
	to the windscreen. A detector automatically deducts charges when a gantry
	is crossed. Vehicles without cards or with cards of insufficient value
	are photo-recorded. These cards can also be used for phone calls and supermarket
	purchases.</p>
      <p>On the whole, no doubt thanks to the introduction of these systems, Singapore
	car ownership is 11 per 100 people, which is very low compared with other
	countries with the same economic output. In 1995, the average road transport
	fuel consumption was 0.34 tonne of oil equivalent per capita resulting
	in 0.29 tonne of carbon emission per capita which is also low in comparison.
	Also, over 80% of the cars are less than 1600 cc and are well maintained,
	with an efficiency of 9 litres of gasoline per 100 km. </p>

<p>Increasing occupancy of travel trips by promoting mass public transport systems
  can result in substantial energy savings and GHG reductions because the emissions
  per passenger are lower especially with well organised routing and stops. Energy
  efficiencies in passenger-km for such systems can be up to 4 times better than
  private cars (Hilling, 1996). Potential reduction in emissions from using such
  systems in comparison to personal transport can be up to 99% in HC, 97% in CO,
  85% in NO<span class="subscript">x</span>, 46% in SO<span class="subscript">x</span>, and 27% in PM (Hilling, 1996). Also, public transport
  systems especially well co-ordinated bus systems can prove very effective as
  shown in the case of Curitiba (see <a href="158.htm#b84">Box 8.4</a>). Urban
  rail systems can prove beneficial in reduction of GHG emissions but experience
  shows that they are expensive especially for cities with less than 5 million
  people. The number of tracks also seriously affects its viability (PTRC, 1991)</p>

      <p>Curitiba, a Brazilian city of 1.6 million people, underwent a major restructuring
	of its bus system in order to reduce congestion and save journey time.
	This restructuring is a good example of the integration of transport with
	land-use planning. The main features of restructuring are the reserved
	bus lanes, the priority of buses over other models at intersections, a
	hierarchy of frequency, interconnecting routes, an easy ticketing system
	to avoid time wastage, and shelters at bus stops. Besides those features,
	various innovations, such as level boarding tubes, assure the speed of
	bus loading and unloading, therefore allowing the buses to operate like
	a surface subway. Feeder buses provide services to the five main corridors
	from more outlying areas. As a result, the use of buses in Curitiba has
	increased significantly.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, three factors made Curitiba a unique case: 1) a continued
	local policy, supported for many years, and favourable to the use of a
	public transport; 2) an urban plan compatible to the solution of public
	transport; and finally 3) an implementation of an integrated net transport.</p>
      <p>The implementation of the integrated net was facilitated mainly by the
	interest of the Volvo Manufacturing Company, which was already established
	in that region, and the geographic characteristics of the city that allow
	the elaboration of an urban plan suitable to the net.</p>
      <p>The rationalisation of the integrated transport system, the land-use
	legislation, and the fact of meeting human needs were seen as the driving
	forces for this system. However, this system is yet to be repeated elsewhere.

<p>With a well-developed communication system, use of telephones and telecommuting
  can assist to reduce travel trips leading to reduction in GHG emissions (Davidson,
  1994). As satellite-based communication systems develops, more comprehensive
  routing of different modes will be possible leading to reduction in GHG emissions.
