<h3> 12.5.6 Technology Transfer among non-Annex I Countries</h3>
Technology transfer among tropical countries, and in general among developing
countries is crucial, given the similarities of forest types, silvicultural practices,
socio-economic and resource conditions. There is a relatively less prominent but
increasing technology transfer among non-Annex I countries. The government initiated
programmes are either on a bilateral basis or through regional cooperation arrangements
such as the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) or Southern African
Development Community (SADC) with collaboration in areas likely to enhance technology
transfer, including natural resource management, trade and investment. For example,
during the 1997 forest fires in Indonesia, there was an extensive regional collaboration
and exchange of techniques on fire suppression and subsequent fire prevention
measures. Regional community networks, involved in conservation and climate-friendly
activities, have been used to exchange techniques among developing countries.
Private sector driven technology transfer has not been as prominent but is likely
to increase due to economic liberalisation and globalisation in non-Annex I countries.
Technology transfer among developing countries in the forestry sector has mainly
been through capacity building and exchange of key needs such as genetically improved
species (e.g., Mexico and Brazil) and procurement of provenance-relevant seeds.
For example, in 1998 the political party subsequently elected to the state government
in Acre, Brazil sent a resource manager to Costa Rica to learn from the experiences
of that country about applicable conservation techniques. Inadequate technology
transfer among non-Annex I countries is primarily due to lack of targeted funding.
This could be addressed by the multilateral and bilateral mechanisms under the
convention.<br>
<br>
South-South technology transfer is increasing in scale and has potential for being
highly cost-effective. Examples in the climate change context include the Costa
Rican Joint Implementation Office assistance to other Latin countries in establishing
programmes to evaluate JI projects; sharing of carbon accounting and monitoring
experience and tools from ECOSUR in Chiapas, Mexico, with other institutes and
NGOs throughout Mexico and other Latin countries, including Brazil; and Malaysian
reduced impact logging technicians training Indonesians (Tipper and de Jong, 1998;
Jones, 1996). <br>
