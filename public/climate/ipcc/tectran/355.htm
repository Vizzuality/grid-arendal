<h1>Case Study 27</h1>
<p> <b>Technology Information Assessment and Dissemination in India</b><br>

  <b>Keywords</b>: Institutional framework, technology development, information
  system, forecasting<br>
  <br>
  <b>Summary</b><br>
  The Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), established
  as an information clearinghouse by Government of India, is playing a significant
  role in technology development of the country. TIFAC can serve as a role model
  institutional infrastructure in a developing country for technology information
  flows, analysis and technology development.<br>
  <b><br>
  Background</b><br>
  Established in 1988, during a period of transition when India was moving from
  a state-regulated economy to a market driven system, TIFAC is an autonomous
  organisation under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
  of India (GoI). Its mission is to undertake technology assessment and forecasting
  studies in key areas of the national economy, keep track of global trends in
  technology and formulate preferred options for India, and establish a nationally
  accessible technology information system. Though it does not explicitly state
  protecting the global environment as one of its objectives, TIFAC was chosen
  for this case study because it represents a developing country's effort to promote
  technology assessment and forecasting that are vital for a successful realisation
  of the initiatives under the Climate Change Convention.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Approach</b><br>
  Activities at TIFAC include information dissemination, studies on technology-linked
  business opportunities, technology sourcing, commercialisation of technology
  projects, and extending patent information service to scientists from academic
  institutions. TIFAC's mandate includes functioning as a clearinghouse on information,
  and is facilitated through a technology information system aimed to disseminate
  techno-commercial information and business opportunities, especially to entrepreneurs
  and business planners. At the macro level, TIFAC has produced a series of documents
  on India's efforts in science and technology development in all sectors (government,
  private and public, etc.). TIFAC disseminates information through newsletters,
  participation in national and international technology expositions, industry
  meetings, and one-to-one mail campaigns. TIFAC provides assistance in technology
  sourcing worldwide. There is a Patent Facilitating Cell, with the support of
  a panel of attorneys, to assist scientists patent their inventions by providing
  financial and technical support. In addition, the functions include information
  dissemination to create awareness about intellectual property rights while keeping
  abreast of global developments and to facilitate the use of patent information
  as inputs to R&amp;D programmes. In order to be in line with global developments,
  TIFAC has international linkages with institutions/organisations including the
  Association of South East Asian Nations, the United Nations Industrial Development
  Organisation, the World Association of Industrial and Technological Research
  Organisation, the International Association of Technology Assessment and Forecasting
  Institutions, the National Science and Technology Board (Singapore), and the
  National Technical Information Service (US Department of Commerce).<br>
  <br>
  <b>Impacts</b><br>
  About 170 studies have been undertaken encompassing a broad spectrum on materials,
  chemicals, energy, environment, and information technology. Studies aimed at
  establishing the technology status in the country vis-&agrave;-vis emerging
  global trends based on 'market-pull' and 'technology-push'. The results have
  been used for investment risk evaluation by financial institutions, and have
  been instrumental in planning the technology development efforts of many government
  departments. To prepare the technology vision for the country, 5000 experts
  from the industry and government, R&amp;D, and academic institutions were brought
  together in a span of two years to identify the focal areas of the country.
  TIFAC's technology sourcing database contains more than 4,000 technology offers
  and business opportunities. It has also established several national centres
  of excellence for joint technology promotion and development in areas like leather,
  aerospace, and chemical technology.<br>
  <b><br>
  Lessons Learned</b><br>
  There are three lessons from this experience:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Access to information is the first step in a programme which aims at 'technology
    development'. This includes creating awareness among the user groups of the
    existence of an information clearinghouse.</li>
  <li> The importance to evolve the objectives/activities of institutions to suit
    the needs of users/stakeholders.</li>
  <li> The extent of involvement of the stakeholders determines the success of
    the venture. </li>
</ul>
