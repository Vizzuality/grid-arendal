<h1>1.5 Stakeholders, Decisions and Policies</h1>
<p>Technology transfer is embodied in the actions taken by individuals and organisations.
  The investment and trade decisions made by firms, acquisition of knowledge and
  skills by individuals through formal education and on-the-job experience, purchase
  of patent rights and licenses, assimilating the published results of public
  or private research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) activity, and
  migration of skilled personnel with knowledge of particular technologies, all
  represent different forms of technology transfer. Technology transfer can also
  be influenced by government aid and financing programs, and by multilateral
  bank lending. Governments can implement policies that promote R&amp;D programmes
  that address global climate change concerns in sectors such as energy, forestry,
  and transportation. The role of governments is especially important for those
  climate-related technologies, which are not immediately viable and profitable.
  An overview of how environmental policies influence technology development and
  diffusion in OECD countries describes public-private partnerships for developing
  environmental technologies and policies aiming at diffusing them (OECD, 1999,
  see also <a href="116.htm">Section 5.6</a> for a more elaborate treatment of
  public-private partnerships).<br>
  <br>
  The rate of technology transfer is affected both by motivations that induce
  more rapid adoption of new techniques and by barriers that impede such transfers.
  Both types of factors can be influenced by policy. <a href="008.htm#t11">Table
  1.1</a> shows a typology of different types of stakeholders, their motivations,
  and the kinds of decisions or policies they can adopt that relate to technology
  transfer. The taxonomy of stakeholders is further described in <a href="014.htm">Annex
  1-1</a>, which could be a useful reference for policymakers to consult. Motivations
  of the various stakeholders can differ markedly:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Transnational or multinational corporations are major sources of technology.
    They seek international sales, market share, and cheaper production costs
    through equipment transfers and foreign direct investment. Corporations are
    primarily concerned about profits, acceptable risks and ensuring protection
    of intellectual property.</li>
  <li> Recipient-country firms are also motivated to transfer technology to minimise
    costs, just as with transnational corporations. But other motivations may
    be quite different from those of supplier firms, such as: (a) technical capabilities,
    quality, or cost reductions that they cannot achieve on their own; (b) the
    higher perceived status of &quot;international level&quot; technologies; (c)
    access to managerial and marketing expertise and sources of capital; (d) access
    to export markets; and (e) access to new distribution networks.</li>
  <li> Recipient governments may seek to increase capabilities for domestic technology-development
    and promote foreign investment in their country. At the local level, communities
    and community organisations need to be reached by information networks, get
    organised and participate in decision-making processes to improve local living
    standards and the quality of the environment via appropriate technologies.</li>
  <li> Provider or donor governments may set up policies to encourage technology
    transfer and fund transfers of research and expertise via Official Development
    Assistance (ODA) to support development and political goals, but more often
    are interested in policies that expand foreign markets for their national
    firms and increase exports. </li>
  <li> Multilateral agencies with development goals, such as the World Bank, the
    United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Regional Development Banks and
    Regional Organisations, pursue technology transfer to support development
    and as an instrument for achieving desired economic and policy reforms.</li>
  <li> Multilateral agencies with environmental goals, such as the Global Environment
    Facility (GEF), have the transfer of ESTs as an explicit objective, and explore
    new and effective means to accomplish these objectives, by catalysing sustainable
    markets and enabling private sector involvement in the transfer of these technologies
    (see <a href="099.htm#b52">Box 5.2</a> for further reference on the GEF).</li>
  <li> Non-governmental organisations have been at the forefront of concerns about
    technology choice and the &quot;appropriateness&quot; of technologies transferred
    through development assistance and commercial channels, the social and cultural
    impacts of such transfers, and the needs for technology adaptation to suit
    local conditions and minimise unwanted impacts. </li>
</ul>
<p>The decisions and policies shown in <a href="008.htm#t11">Table 1.1</a> represent 
  another point of departure for thinking about barriers to technology transfer 
  and interventions for overcoming such barriers. Each of these decisions and 
  policies will face a set of barriers that will limit their realisation. We see 
  throughout this Report how interventions affect the decisions and policies presented 
  in <a href="008.htm#t11">Table 1.1</a>. (For further reference on the link between 
  relevant policy tools with barriers see <a href="054.htm#t41">Table 4.1</a> 
  and <a href="094.htm#t51">5.1</a> which also indicate the relevant sectors).</p>
<p>The relevant aspects of the capacity for technology choice - a true measure
  of the capacity to make independent decisions on sustainable development - are
  a separate issue, and are taken up in Chapters <a href="033.htm">3</a>-<a href="092.htm">5</a>,
  while the criteria for the effectiveness of technology transfer are elaborated
  upon in <a href="015.htm">Annex 1-2</a> and briefly in <a href="122.htm">Chapter
  6</a>.</p>
