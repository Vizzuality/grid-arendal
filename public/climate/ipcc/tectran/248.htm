<h3>12.5.8 Financial Mechanisms<sup><small><a href="fn13.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(13,2); return false;">2</a></small></sup></h3>
<p> The existing and emerging financial mechanisms may have to be strengthened
  and reoriented to promote forestry mitigation projects. The traditional funding
  sources for forestry are domestic official, multilateral, external developmental
  assistance and commercial (private). In developing countries, large domestic
  financial gaps will make increasing internal funding for the forestry sector
  difficult, and alternate sources will be required (FAO, 1997). Post-UNCED international
  opinion is that forests warrant preferential allocation of funds. Estimates
  suggest that forestry accounts for only 1.6% of combined 1993 official and private
  funding transfers to developing countries. In 1993 bilateral aid accounted for
  60% of developmental assistance flows to the forestry sector followed by multilateral
  banks (27%). An FAO survey revealed that 60% of responding countries relied
  on foreign sources for the greater part of their forestry sector funding (FAO,
  1997). Thus, external funding is critical to the forestry sector. The private
  sector is increasingly becoming an important source of such funding. There are
  a number of domestic sources of funding to the forestry sector, particularly
  industries and farmers. Multilateral and private agencies may prefer funding
  private sector institutions in developing countries. However, bilateral developmental
  assistance may largely concentrate on forest conservation and protected areas
  that come under the control of state forest departments. Significant additional
  investment is required for R&amp;D institutions in developing countries as currently,
  only 5% of developmental assistance is channelled to forestry research compared
  with about 10% to agriculture.<br>
  <br>
  <i>GEF.</i> GEF is an institutional arrangement for supporting climate change
  mitigation programmes through providing incremental costs and supporting capacity
  building programmes. GEF needs to re-orient its operational programmes to incorporate
  forestry mitigation, which is being currently attempted through the new operational
  programme-12 and adaptation programmes. GEF could reorient and intensify support
  to programmes for capacity building (as suggested by FCCC/CP/1998/ADD1) for:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Implementing adaptation measures through environmentally sound technologies</li>
  <li> Assessing technology needs and identifying the sources and suppliers of
    technologies and the modalities for the acquisition and absorption in developing
    countries</li>
  <li> Designing, formulating, evaluating, implementing and managing mitigation
    and adaptation projects</li>
  <li> Facilitating national/regional access to information generated by international
    centres and networks and for disseminating information services and transfer
    of environmentally sound technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p> The new operational programme, which is currently being finalised, is likely
  to facilitate a systematic and widespread implementation of viable carbon sequestration
  opportunities. It may finance information and advisory and capacity building
  services to public or private decision-makers, provide exposure to policy and
  business concepts, provide access to mainstream sources of financing. Furthermore,
  GEF may consider investment financing and risk management services through various
  forms of innovative financing including contingent financing or risk guarantee
  schemes. Investment in the majority of climate mitigation projects in the forestry
  sector also leads to conservation of biodiversity, a major area of concern to
  GEF. <br>
  <br>
  <i>Flexibility mechanisms.</i> CDM, if approved by the UNFCCC inclusive of forestry
  activities, along with JI, could be viewed as potential investment opportunities
  when they become operational. The Kyoto Protocol restricts JI to activities
  between Annex B countries. Some forestry sector JI projects may be undertaken
  between the present members of <a href="362.htm">Annex B</a>, such as two projects
  now underway between the US and Russia, but the potential might increase substantially
  if some developing countries in tropical forest areas join <a href="362.htm">Annex
  B</a> in the future. The lessons from JI-like projects begun in tropical countries
  under such programmes as the US initiative on Joint Implementation (US-IJI)
  could be valuable both in the context of possible future JI activities if more
  countries join Annex B, and, potentially, for similar activities under the CDM.
  If some tropical countries join Annex B, the potential for emissions trading
  under Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol would offer substantial opportunities
  for these countries to capture carbon benefits by reducing their emissions from
  deforestation. Because such trading is based on national-level carbon accounts,
  these benefits are not affected by problems of leakage and boundary definition
  that are common in project-based initiatives such as those under JI and the
  CDM. Decisions by the governments of these countries on policies that affect
  deforestation would require reliable scenarios to predict the results of possible
  policy changes on deforestation and other measures. This could often benefit
  from technology transfer of analytical tools and experience from elsewhere.
  A good example of using a mix of financial incentives for forest conservation
  and reforestation programmes is Costa Rica (Castro and Arias, 1998). </p>
