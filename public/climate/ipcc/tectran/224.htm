<h3>11.5.2 Transferred Technologies </h3>
<p> 
  <b>Adaptation </b><br>
  Adaptation to climate change is likely; the extent depends on the affordability
  of adaptive measures mentioned in <a href="214.htm#t114">Table 11.4</a>, access
  to technology and biophysical constrains such as water resource availability,
  soil characteristics, genetic diversity, crop breeding, and topography. National
  studies have shown incremental additional costs of agricultural production under
  climate change which could create a serious burden for some developing countries
  (IPCC, 1996). <br>
  <br>
  Nearly all agricultural impact studies conducted over the past 5 years have
  considered some technological options for adapting to climate change (IPCC,
  1996). Technology transfer and diffusion of new technologies could in particular
  focus on improvement of irrigation technology and alternative species and varieties.<br>
  <b><i><br>
  Improving irrigation technology. </i></b><br>
  Changes in temperature and precipitation levels will alter the hydrological
  cycle and water supplies. In general, the IPCC (1996) notes that estimated precipitation
  increases in high latitude regions may lead to runoff increase; runoff will
  tend to decrease in lower latitudes due to combined temperature increase and
  precipitation decrease. Increased rainfall intensity would increase soil erosion,
  while in other regions agriculture could be affected by drought. Rind et al.
  (1990) use GCM results to calculate that for many mid-latitude locations (e.g.,
  USA) the incidence of severe droughts that currently occur only 5% of the time
  could rise to a 50% frequency by 2050, based on the difference between precipitation
  and potential evapotranspiration. Such a change would constitute a severe natural
  disaster for agricultural production.<br>
  <br>
  About 253 million hectares, 17% of the world's crop land, are irrigated. This
  land produces more than one-third of the world's food (Geijer et al., 1996).
  Irrigation is therefore increasingly important for adapting to the effects of
  climate change on agricultural production. Almost three-quarters of the world's
  irrigated area is in developing countries. To mitigate the negative effects
  of climate change on agriculture, developing countries should improve their
  existing irrigation efficiency through adoption of drip irrigation systems and
  other water-conserving technologies (FAO 1989, 1990a). An alternative is to
  import technologies and equipment from developed countries that have advanced
  irrigation technologies. See <a href="224.htm#b116">Box 11.6</a> for a discussion 
  of the main barriers involved. <br>

    <td>
      <p>The main flow of irrigation technology transfer is from developed to
	developing countries. The primary barrier encountered by the importing
	developing countries is that they cannot afford the high cost of patents
	and equipment. The second barrier is that the importers do not have enough
	money to build the auxiliary equipment for the introduced technology,
	because developing countries, in many cases, only buy key equipment due
	to their limited financial resources. The third barrier for irrigation
	technology transfer between countries is that the importing developing
	countries are not clearly aware of what technologies fit their conditions
	and where they can find the suitable ones. The importers do not always
	receive satisfactory service when there are problems with their imported
	equipment or scientific instrument. </p>

  <i>
  New species and varieties adapted to changing climate. </i><br>
  For most major crops, varieties exist with a wide range of maturities and climatic
  tolerances. For example, Matthews et al. (1994) identified wide genetic variability
  among rice varieties as a reasonably uncomplicated response to spikelet sterility
  in rice that occurred in simulations for South and Southeast Asia. Studies in
  Australia showed that responses to climate change are strongly cultivar dependent
  (Wang et al., 1992). The genetic base is broad for most crops but limited for
  some (e.g., kiwi fruit). A study by Easterling et al. (1993) explored how hypothetical
  new varieties would respond to climate change (also reported in McKenney et
  al., 1992). Heat, drought, and pest resistance, salt tolerance, and general
  improvements in crop yield and quality would be beneficial for crop adaptation
  (Smit, 1993). See <a href="224.htm#b117">Box 11.7</a>. <br>

      <p>The development of a new mangrove rice variety in Africa is an important
	case study of technology development and transfer. Much of the success
	of this effort hinged on the accident of a critical mass of researchers
	at the government rice research station in Rokupr Sierra Leone and the
	interest of the West African Rice Research Development Association (WARDA)
	in this effort. WARDA provided additional resources to the station at
	Rokupr to carry out the development of a new rice variety to meet the
	changed climate conditions, and improve yields above those previously
	achieved. The Sierra Leone agricultural research establishment was able
	to demonstrate the value of their rice research effort to the food supply
	of the nation and WARDA was able to demonstrate to their financial supporters
	their value in contributing to this new technology and its transfer. There
	was a German seed distribution project that helped with some seed distribution,
	but farmers themselves undertook most of the technology transfer to other
	farmers once the success of the new variety became apparent (Prahah-Asante
	et al., 1982, 1986; Spencer, 1975; Spencer et al., 1979; Tre et al., 1998;
	WARDA, 1987; Zinnah, 1992; Zinnah et al., 1993).</p>

<p> <b>Mitigation</b><br>
  Most developing countries depend heavily on agriculture. Developing countries
  are barely able to adopt the mitigation technologies mentioned in <a href="214.htm#t113">Table
  11.3</a> to mitigate the GHG emissions in agricultural systems, because of barriers
  mentioned in <a href="214.htm#t114">Table 11.4</a>. If advanced technologies
  are transferred to them with demonstration projects, as well as technical assistance
  and financial support, GHG emissions will be reduced. <br>
  <br>
  <i>Improvement of the efficiency of nitrogen fertiliser. </i><br>
  Nitrogen fertiliser efficiency decreased with increased nitrogen fertiliser
  input. So farmers need additional information such as soil testing data, as
  well as educational support to interpret the data. They can also gain experience
  by participating in demonstration projects. Extension personnel are needed to
  provide on-farm technical assistance with new practices to increase N efficiency.
  Availability of application machinery and technologies must be transferred simultaneously
  to be effective. <br>
  <i><br>
  Reducing methane emission from rice fields. </i><br>
  Feasible mitigation strategies that have been verified to significantly reduce
  methane emission from rice fields are temporary midseason aeration of the soil,
  using fermented instead of fresh organic manure, applying sulfate containing
  fertiliser, and planting/breeding rice cultivars with low emission capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Reducing methane emission from animal waste. </i><br>
  Biogas digesters can provide clean energy and high quality fertiliser, and can
  be an important option for reducing methane emission from livestock manure.
  This technology is widely recognised as an EST and has been widely accepted
  all over the world, especially in China and India. </p>
