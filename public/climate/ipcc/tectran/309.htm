<h3>15.6.1 Incentives for Transnational Technology Transfer </h3>
<p>Similar to in-country technology transfer, the incentives for the international
  transfer and diffusion of coastal-adaptation technologies are not predominantly
  commercial. Amongst the stakeholders, the goals of the international business
  community are increased global market share for their products and hence, increased
  profits. However, as stated before, the coastal-technology sector is fragmented
  and consists mostly of small companies that lack the resources to initiate technology
  transfer. Scientists need to be aware of new scientific advances so that their
  own accomplishments do not re-invent already published work, and that their
  research both builds on complimentary work and identifies other leading researchers.
  To fulfil their missions, government organisations must have access to the best
  available technologies and latest information. Therefore, national governments
  are the primary investors in and sources of coastal-adaptation technologies,
  and governments at all levels comprise the predominant market.</p>
<p>Coastal adaptation to climate change is a transnational issue-it cannot be
  addressed within the borders of one country, no matter how effective and creative
  the decision-makers, innovative the academic relationships and dynamic the private
  sector are in advancing the deployment of appropriate technologies. Alliances
  for technology transfer between countries are a way to leverage shortages or
  complement the skills of local scientists and engineers, share financial and
  other resources and develop and extend access of technical assistance and capacity
  building to strategic locations around the world (Kozmetsky, 1990). An example
  is the EU Marine and Science Technology (MAST) programme, which requires partnerships
  of at least two non-affiliated partners from two member states or from one member
  state and an associated state. The EU International Co-operation with Developing
  Countries (INCO-DC) and ASEAN Environment Programme (ASEP) are two examples
  of many programmes supporting scientific cooperation between industrialised
  and developing countries to stimulate collaborative research and broaden knowledge
  of all partners.</p>
<p>An example of effective multinational, cross-institutional cooperation is the
  development of airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) technology for shoreline
  topography and bathymetry surveying (Lillycrop and Estep, 1995). The technology
  offers a significant advance in capabilities for collecting, analysing, using
  and retaining critical data for coastal management. One airborne lidar system
  for bathymetry surveying was developed by a small Canadian company, with financial
  support from the Canadian government. In 1988, the United States' Army Corps
  of Engineers and the Canadian government began a shared-cost programme for the
  design, construction and field verification of the lidar technology. The original
  Canadian private-sector developer provided technical-design support, an American
  surveying company provided evaluation services, and both governments provided
  financial and operational support. Lidar is now operational and has been applied
  in a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The
  Netherlands and Australia.</p>
