<h3>8.5.1 Barriers to Technology Transfer between Countries</h3>
<p>The barriers to technology transfer of transport options between countries
  discussed above can be categorised into technological, financial, institutional,
  information and social. These should be seen along with the generic barriers
  already discussed in <a href="092.htm">Chapter 5</a> of this report. In the
  transport sector, an overriding barrier that require emphasis is the lack of
  an enabling business environment for both technology supplier and technology
  recipient countries to promote technology transfer. Industrialised countries,
  which are mostly technology suppliers, can institute economic and fiscal measures
  and regulations with the necessary compliance regimes that can stimulate the
  private sector to transfer transport technologies. Technology recipients, which
  are mostly developing countries, need to create the enabling environment that
  is receptive to transport technologies (UNEP, 1998). Lack of a suitable enabling
  environment is particularly absent in low-income and capital constrained countries.
  In general, technology recipient countries need to build an effective business
  environment to attract involvement of the private sector, which is now increasing
  its role in transport technology flows, especially in transport infrastructure.
</p>
<p>An important technical barrier to technology inflows to any country is lack
  of the necessary manufacturing capabilities, especially in technology recipient
  countries. Additionally, a lack of companies to undertake sub-contracting, as
  may be required by large transport companies, and the absence of suitable facilities
  for training and RD&amp;D can create serious problems for technology development
  and transfer. An important financial barrier is access to capital, because most
  of the transport options are very expensive and involve long lead times such
  as building or modifying highways and bridges. These activities may involve
  significant capital outlay and many institutions with different interests. Harmonising
  and optimising these interests can prove to be challenging (Pacudan, 1999).
  Also, implementing some non-motorised measures such as wider use of cycling
  can be expensive, because of the need for dedicated lanes and other support
  infrastructure, which would be a barrier for many countries. Lack of compliance
  and arbitration institutions can be a barrier for effective private sector participation.
  Lack of knowledge of the existence and development of environmentally friendly
  transport options, including their weaknesses and benefits, will be a major
  barrier in adopting them. This is common among technology recipients. Differences
  in social and cultural systems among countries can be a barrier, because some
  transport options are sensitive to these differences. Adopting cycling may require
  certain lifestyle change as well as some other non-motorised systems. Similarly,
  adoption of recently smaller and more fuel-efficient cars that is being manufactured
  by many of the major manufacturers may not be acceptable to many countries because
  of their transport needs. Political will by respective governments for technology
  transfer is needed and so can be a major obstacle if absent. </p>
