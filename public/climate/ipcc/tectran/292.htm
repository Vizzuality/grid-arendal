<h1>5.1 Introduction</h1>
<p> A variety of coastal systems produce a large number of goods and services
  that are valuable to society. This has attracted many people and major investments
  to coastal zones, even to places that are susceptible to hazards such as storm
  surges and coastal erosion. In many places, technology has been instrumental
  in reducing society's vulnerability to coastal hazards, in three basic ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <i>Protect</i>--reduce the risk of the event by decreasing its probability
    of occurrence;</li>
  <li><i> Retreat</i>--reduce the risk of the event by limiting its potential
    effects;</li>
  <li><i> Accommodate</i>--increase society's ability to cope with the effects
    of the event.</li>
</ul>
<p> Extensive research has shown that climate change will increase the hazard
  potential for many coastal zones. The same three strategies of protect, retreat
  and accommodate can be followed to reduce vulnerability to climate change, including
  application of the same range of hard and soft technologies as are used today.
  However, many of the world's vulnerable coastal countries currently do not have
  access to appropriate adaptation technologies, nor to the knowledge or resources
  that are required to develop or implement these. Effective coastal adaptation
  by these countries could benefit from increasing current efforts of technology
  transfer.<br>
  <br>
  This chapter uses the term &quot;technology&quot; in its broadest possible sense,
  including knowledge. A technology is considered appropriate when it is environmentally
  sound, economically viable and culturally and socially acceptable, amongst other
  criteria. The extent to which a technology meets these criteria differs from
  one location to another, suggesting that the appropriateness of a technology
  is not universal but-at least in part-determined by local factors. Technology
  transfer, as explained in <a href="003.htm">Chapter 1</a>, is the broad set
  of processes covering the exchange of knowledge, money and goods amongst different
  stakeholders that lead to the spreading of technology for adapting to or mitigating
  climate change.<br>
  <br>
  Coastal adaptation to climate change must be seen as part of a broader coastal-management
  policy, which includes consideration of numerous non-climatic issues (Harvey
  et al., 1999). It typically follows a continuous and iterative cycle involving
  four main steps: (i) information development and awareness raising, (ii) planning
  and design, (iii) implementation and (iv) monitoring and evaluation (Klein et
  al., 1999). To date, technology transfer for coastal adaptation has focused
  primarily on the implementation stage: the actual hardware that can be employed
  to protect or, to a lesser extent, retreat or accommodate. As argued by Klein
  et al. (1999), coastal adaptation should also aim at increasing the extent to
  which mechanisms are in place and technologies, expertise and other resources
  are available to assist the other three steps.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="296.htm">Section 15.3</a> therefore identifies available technologies
  for each of the four steps of adaptation, with <a href="301.htm">Section 15.4</a>
  assessing current and future trends in the transfer of these technologies. <a href="302.htm">Sections
  15.5</a> and <a href="308.htm">15.6</a> analyses important barriers and opportunities
  for coastal-technology transfer in light of economic, institutional, legal and
  socio-cultural aspects, within and between countries respectively. <a href="314.htm">Section
  15.7</a> summarises the lessons learnt and suggests future actions. First, however,
  <a href="293.htm">Section 15.2</a> gives an overview of anticipated coastal
  impacts of climate change and concurrent non-climate stresses affecting coastal-adaptation
  needs.</p>
