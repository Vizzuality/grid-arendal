<p><b>Summary</b><br>
  The energy derived from bio-mass in this case is from a renewable &quot;clean&quot; 
  source. The National Alcohol Programme (PROALCOOL), was launched in Brazil to 
  substitute the motor vehicle fuel (imported) gasoline with locally produced 
  alcohol. This involved cooperation between the Brazilian government, farmers, 
  alcohol producers and the car manufacturers. There is a significant scope for 
  replication in other developing and developed countries.</p>
<p><b>Background</b><br>
  The programme was launched in November 1975. Its objectives were to guarantee 
  the steady supply of fuel in the country, to substitute a motor vehicle fuel 
  from a renewable energy source for imported gasoline, and to encourage technological 
  development in connection with the production of sugar cane and alcohol. </p>
<p>Until 1979, the first phase of the Programme, alcohol production concentrated 
  on anhydrous alcohol (99.33% ethanol) for blending with gasoline. The second 
  phase, which began with the second oil crisis (1979), focused on hydrated alcohol 
  used in pure form as car fuel. </p>
<p><b>Approach</b><br>
  The first cars run solely on fuel alcohol were produced in 1979. By December 
  1984, the number of cars run on pure hydrated alcohol reached 1 800 000, i.e., 
  17% of the country's car fleet. A protocol between the car manufacturers and 
  the Brazilian Federal Government was then signed. Independent and autonomous 
  distilleries, outfitted exclusively for producing alcohol directly from sugar 
  cane syrup were constructed. Since its inauguration in 1975, the programme has 
  yielded positive results, though it has suffered a prolonged crisis since 1989.</p>
<p><b>Impacts</b><br>
  Fuel alcohol is a &quot;clean&quot; fuel because alcohol-run vehicles emit less 
  carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and sulphur. Furthermore, as an additive to gasoline, 
  alcohol replaces the hazardous tetraethyl lead used to increase the gasoline 
  octane level. The Brazilian Fuel Alcohol Programme may prove to be an important 
  alternative that helps stabilise the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The energy potential of sugar cane bagasse, if fully used as a substitute for 
  fuel oil, for the use of the production units proper as well as for the larger 
  network, would help bring down CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions further. The carbon emitted through 
  the combustion of motor fuel is reabsorbed by the sugar cane, rendering net 
  emissions practically to zero. </p>
<p>A possibility for increasing Brazilian alcohol competitiveness is its export 
  for use as an additive to gasoline in developed countries since its cost in 
  Brazil is competitive with the USA and Europe. The export of alcohol is currently 
  hindered by commercial barriers aimed to protect U.S. and European agriculture. 
  Developed countries could finance alcohol production in developing countries 
  at lower cost to CO<span class="subscript">2</span> abatement than in developed countries proper. Both sides 
  may find the arrangement advantageous, as this entails the implementation of 
  international commercial relationships and increased employment in the developing 
  countries due to the labour intensive production of sugar cane. </p>
<p>The main obstacle to practical agreements on concrete projects with high potential 
  for large-scale abatement such as fuel alcohol is the mistrust resulting from 
  the historical tradition of zero-sum relations between North and South. </p>
<p>The advantages of fuel alcohol as a renewable energy source posing fewer hazards 
  to the environment and reducing local atmospheric pollution are significant. 
  The major and indisputable contribution of fuel alcohol is its potential for 
  reducing CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions, considered a key factor in the intensification of the 
  greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>The UN Convention on Climate Change contemplates measures for controlling CO<span class="subscript">2</span> 
  emissions in the mid and long term. Reducing the uses of fossil fuels is an 
  important item on the agenda. This, together with considerations on the possible 
  increase in petroleum prices, has prompted European countries and the United 
  States to look seriously into the question of restricting the use of fossil 
  fuels. In this context, Brazil may have a head start in the employment of a 
  &quot;clean&quot; energy source such as fuel alcohol and sugar cane bagasse. 
  In addition to the country's contribution to the transnational efforts for controlling 
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions, Brazil will also benefit from reduced local pollution levels, 
  greater employment and the securing of a national energy source. </p>
<p> <b><br>
  Lessons Learned </b><br>
  The following are to be avoided: (1) The transfer of old technologies, even 
  if they are more efficient than the host country's prevalent technology. (2) 
  The transfer of heavy, energy intensive industry. (3) The transfer of credits 
  for low cost emissions abatement now, at the price of high cost abatement in 
  the future. (4) The transaction cost of the additionality issue. </p>
<p>The following are desirable: (1) Global emissions will be lower with technology 
  transfer than without it. (2) The technology will slow the rate of growth in 
  GHG emissions of developing countries. (3) Projects will support national development 
  priorities in the host countries. </p>
