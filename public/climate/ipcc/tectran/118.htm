<h3>5.6.2 Information Clearinghouses and Technology Transfer Agencies</h3>
<p> In order for technology transfer transactions to take place, parties must
  know about each other and understand the costs and benefits of different technology
  transfer pathways. Often projects, particularly to introduce the new energy
  technologies, are conceived without proper understanding of the needs and priorities
  of the targeted users (Mapako, 1997). Consumers or purchasers must be aware
  that technologies exist, must know their performance characteristics, reliability,
  capital costs, operating costs, and economic benefits, and must know how to
  maintain and service technologies or know of firms who can. While in most of
  the developed countries there are a multitude of information sources, the same
  is not the situation in the developing countries. Interviews with more than
  a hundred negotiators and policymakers in developing countries can be summed
  up in the words of one interviewee: &quot;we do not know what is available and
  what we really need&quot; (Gupta, 1997, p.89).<br>
  <br>
  Information clearinghouses and technology transfer agencies are specific forms
  of technology intermediaries that have been proposed by UN and other public
  agencies. These agencies point out that numerous public and private environmental
  information systems already exist. Improving these existing systems and linking
  them through clearinghouses can be a first step towards establishing an international
  network of technological information. A number of international information
  networks and databases that specifically address climate-mitigation technologies
  already exist (UN, 1997). <br>
  <br>
  Although governments commonly set up information centres, in some countries,
  national or sector specific industry associations have also set up information
  centres. The information centres are of two types: information of a highly technical
  nature, required by larger energy consumers, and general information as would
  be required by households and small commercial establishments. Traditionally,
  schools and colleges, science centres, and museums have also been common vehicles
  for providing general information.<br>
  <br>
  But beyond the simple supply of information, more sophisticated technology transfer
  agencies can actively promote knowledge transfer through a number of activities:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> conducting workshops, seminars, and conferences</li>
  <li> assisting technology producers in marketing their technology and understanding
    markets</li>
  <li> providing training and assistance in preparing business plans</li>
  <li> matching potential joint venture partners</li>
  <li> securing intellectual property rights and assisting in creating licensing
    agreements</li>
  <li> educating financiers about specific technologies and channelling investment
    proposals</li>
</ul>
<p> Notwithstanding the UN initiatives in this direction, many countries in the
  developing world and CEITs have initiated systems to provide information on
  different technologies. In a recent climate technology and technology-information-needs
  survey among developing countries under the auspices of the Subsidiary Body
  of Scientific and Technology Advice, 60% of the respondents pinpointed to national
  technology information centres as an important vehicle for dissemination of
  climate relevant technologies and practices. In over 75% of these respondents'
  home countries at least two such technology information centres exist (van Berkel
  &amp; Arkesteijn, 1998). Successful energy-efficiency centres in several economies
  in transition (China, Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, and the Czech Republic) are
  good examples of technology intermediaries that have been established with international
  assistance (Chandler et al., 1996). As another example, <a href="118.htm#b56">Box 5.6</a> describes national-level
  technology intermediaries in India for energy efficiency and renewable energy
  technologies.<br>
  <br>
  Most developing countries have a large proportion of small and medium scale
  industrial concerns whose outputs constitute a significant portion of the GDP
  of these countries. The technology information needs of these enterprises may
  not be the same as that of big MNCs operating in these countries. Nevertheless
  the technology information centres springing up in developing countries do or
  can not serve MNCs. While the private sector has often been disdainful of such
  information programmes, many representatives of developing countries report
  that they find vendor information biased and confusing and need help to evaluate
  competing vendor claims. Such technology information centres can provide such
  help. The small and medium scale industries are generally short in management
  and technological capabilities, and can make effective use of information clearinghouses
  on ESTs. Having said that one should also realise that the small-scale industries
  or the so-called informal sector are far removed from such initiatives, thus
  it is desirable that agencies use intermediaries to reach them with this information.<br>
  <br>
  Regulating electric power utilities to perform so-called Demand-Side Management
  (DSM) is a form of technology intermediation that became well established in
  the United States in the 1980s (see <a href="118.htm#b57">Box 5.7</a>). Utilities
  in Germany, Denmark, Canada and other developing countries have followed. Now
  DSM programmes are being taken up in Thailand, the Philippines, Mexico, Jamaica,
  Brazil and other developing countries as well (see also <a href="338.htm">Case
  studies 10</a> and <a href="351.htm">23</a> in <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>).<br>

      <p>National-level government agencies acting as intermediaries can also
	be important in creating incentives and facilitating a market for cleaner
	technologies. The Energy Management Centre (EMC), an autonomous agency,
	under the Ministry of Power, Government of India, is an example of a technology
	intermediary for energy efficiency. EMC has been carrying out a number
	of initiatives to promote energy conservation and efficiency in India.
	To begin with, EMC set up and trained 25 agencies (public, private, NGOs),
	to provide specialised energy auditing and management to consumers in
	India. Each of these agencies are carrying out an average of 10-12 energy
	audits annually, and the feedback from the industry is that there is an
	urgent need for many more such professional agencies to be able to serve
	the consumers in the country. EMC also carried out a number of studies
	in the area of technologies for energy efficiency, issues relating to
	standards and labelling, as well as implementing a nation-wide energy
	conservation awareness project. EMC annually organises, through industry
	associations, about 20-25 training programmes and workshops for wider
	dissemination of information on energy conservation in the country. To
	date, it is reported that over 5000 professionals have been provided training
	in different aspects of energy efficiency. Regular feedback carried out
	indicated that the participants have actually implemented energy efficiency
	projects in their organisations. EMC was the executing agency for international
	cooperation projects with Germany, the European Union, and the Department
	of Energy (USA), among others. </p>
      <p>The initiatives of the Indian Government implemented through the EMC
	have resulted in a significant rise in the exposure and awareness on energy
	conservation technologies. It is reported that there are proposals to
	introduce standards for appliance and energy consuming devices and these
	would be mandatory. Penalties for non-compliance would be enforced once
	the law is passed by the Indian parliament. Under a collaborative programme
	with the EU, EMC has set up an Information Service on Energy Efficiency
	(ISEE), jointly with a national industry association. The database established
	is expected to contain information on technologies, guide books, manuals,
	best practice programmes, a list of manufacturers, etc. and is expected
	to fill the gap in information for energy consumers.</p>
      <p>The Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC)
	in India was established as an autonomous organisation of the Indian Department
	of Science and Technology, and has been particularly successful in making
	the public-private sector linkages, providing information on patent issues,
	and supporting start-up ventures. Each of these activities provides important
	examples for other similar, knowledge-based technology transfer policy
	offices.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources (MNES) in the nodal ministry
	responsible for providing the overall thrust and direction for increased
	adoption and installation of renewable energy devices in the country.
	MNES implements the programmes through the state governments and through
	state energy nodal agencies. MNES has separate programmes for biogas,
	solar thermal, solar PV, biomass gasifier, and for new technologies.</p>

      <p>The key role played by electric utilities as technology intermediaries
	in promoting energy efficiency has been well established in scientific
	literature. Historically, utilities in the US began offering energy efficiency
	or demand side management (DSM) programmes to consumers after regulators
	made this a policy goal. The utilities were compensated by the utility
	commissions for any loss of revenue that may have occurred in this process,
	after accounting for other savings due to reduced fuel costs, etc. Investment
	on DSM is reported to exceed US $2 billion, and this is expected to account
	for about 14% of the new investment in the power sector in the US in 1994.
	Utilities in Germany, Denmark, Canada and other countries followed. Now
	DSM programmes are being taken up in Thailand, the Philippines, Mexico,
	Jamaica, Brazil and other developing countries as well (see <a href="338.htm">Case
	Study 10</a> and <a href="351.htm">23</a> on DSM in Chapter 16). These
	programmes are in their early phase, and they account for a small portion
	of the activities on energy efficiency in these countries. Utilities are
	essentially playing the role of information provider to start with; then
	they assist consumers to achieve energy efficiency at the consumers' premises.
	Several utilities have set up independent companies, 100% owned by the
	utility, which are outside the control of the regulator, since energy
	efficiency business was essentially unregulated.</p>
