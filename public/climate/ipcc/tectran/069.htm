<h3>4.5.6 Capacity Building: Current issues </h3>
<p>
  The centrality and significance of the 'capacity-building' agenda has become
  recognised by the G77 and China group within the UNFCCC, which sponsored a decision
  for consideration at CoP5 (FCCC/SB/1999/CRP.9), which related to all the CoP4
  decisions and was agreed with some modifications. If action follows at CoP6,
  and there is now a parallel text covering the countries with economies in transition
  (CEITs), it will provide an integrated framework on capacity building covering
  all dimensions of the Convention, not just technology transfer. The focus of
  required action is within the developing countries suggesting: the strengthening
  of national (and regional) focal points to cover training and human resources
  development; research activities; expertise on specialised aspects such as information
  technology; and a networking system between these components. The concept effectively
  is to develop National Systems of Innovation identified in <a href="055.htm">Section
  4.3</a>.<br>
  <br>
  The need to place emphasis on strengthening capacity within developing countries
  to their agenda has been recognised by the OECD (1995).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> ... Capacity issues in all states including those in the Southern countries
    are embedded in political, cultural, and social dynamics of enormous complexity,
    a good number of which are likely to be beyond the understanding of the donor
    community. Raising the environmental performance of organisations and institutions
    in any society is a daunting task even for its own citizens. Assuming this
    can be done easily by outside interveners may be the first mistake in any
    capacity development programme (OECD, 1995, p.10).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Capacity-building is required at all stages in the process of technology transfer.
  It is a slow and complex process to which long-term commitments must be made
  for resources and to which the host country must also be committed if results
  are to bear fruit. Fundamental change requires an autonomous capacity to innovate,
  acquire and adapt technologies. For the mitigation agenda, there are specific
  needs for additional resources at the assessment and repetition stages: (a)
  to ensure there is a broad national commitment to ESTs and that those most appropriate
  for national circumstances are selected; and (b) to ensure that indigenous capacity
  for ongoing innovation is developed to encourage North-north, South-North and
  South-South flows. For adaptation there is a need a) to strengthen scientific
  expertise and institutions capable of undertaking the relevant assessments and
  to promote linkages with this infrastructure with other parts of the public
  and private sectors; and b) to identify relevant tools and techniques to produce
  outputs for nationally determined priorities.</p>
