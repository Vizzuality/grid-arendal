<h1>Case Study 19</h1>
<p> <b>Dissemination of Biogas Digester Technology</b><br>

  <br>
  <b>Summary</b><br>
  Small-scale biogas digesters have been reasonably successful in China and India 
  for providing clean energy and high quality fertilisers in rural areas. The 
  Asia-Pacific Region Biogas Research and Training Centre (BRTC), founded primarily 
  to facilitate diffusion of biogas digester technology, has contributed significantly 
  to promoting the development of biogas digester technology in developing countries. 
  This case is a unique example of a South-South technology transfer.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Background</b><br>
  Global methane emissions from livestock manure were estimated to be 20-30 Tg/yr. 
  Manure management systems that store manure under anaerobic conditions contribute 
  about 60% to this source. Biogas digesters have a proven record as an environmentally 
  sound technology and find considerable acceptability in China and India. These 
  digesters are designed to enhance the anaerobic decomposition of organic material 
  and to maximise methane production and recovery. Moreover, this technology has 
  proven to be suitable for temperate as well as tropical climatic conditions. 
  In addition to reducing methane emissions from livestock manure, anaerobic digesters 
  are very well suited to meeting rural energy requirements. This technology also 
  reduces the demand for commercial fertilisers and, thus, helps protect the environment 
  and improve human health.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Approach</b><br>
  The BRTC was established in 1981 in Chengdu, China, to spread the use of the 
  technology in other countries. BRTC has since been responsible for training 
  technical engineers in countries from Africa and the Asia-Pacific region. The 
  parties involved in setting up this centre were the United Nations Development 
  Programme (UNDP), the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
  Relations and Trade in China. The Chinese government was interested in the project 
  because it provided a good opportunity to publicise biogas digesters in developing 
  countries at a reasonably low cost. However, one of the major barriers to initiating 
  this project was the financial resource needed to support trainees from developing 
  countries. Furthermore, small farmers found it difficult to raise enough financial 
  resources to cover the initial costs of constructing a biogas digester. <br>
  During the first six years of its operation, the centre received financial support 
  from UNDP. Subsequently, the Chinese government undertook the financial responsibility 
  for training engineers. Since the time of its inception, the centre has conducted 
  21 training workshops with over 270 participants from over 71 countries. During 
  the period 1980 to 1990, this centre assisted the construction of over 70 digesters 
  in 22 developing countries.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Impacts</b><br>
  Most participants of the programme acquired the skills to construct, operate 
  and maintain small-scale biogas digesters in their countries. The centre proved 
  to be a valuable tool in demonstrating the usefulness of capacity building in 
  transferring technology. In addition to sequestering methane emissions, the 
  technology provided clean and convenient ways of energy generation.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  Important lessons from this case are:<br>
  Technology transfer from one developing country to another works remarkably 
  well.<br>
  Technology transfers among developing countries are limited because most advanced 
  technologies are developed and owned by industrialised countries. <br>
  Greater emphasis on joint development of technology is likely to increase developing 
  country participation. <br>
  In a technology transfer case between developing countries, financing can become 
  an issue.<br>
