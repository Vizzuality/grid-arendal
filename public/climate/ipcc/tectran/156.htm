<h3>8.2.2 Fuel Technology Improvements </h3>
<p>Gasoline and diesel can be improved by chemical reformulation that can lead
  to decrease in ozone-forming pollutants and carbon monoxide emissions per km
  travelled, but will be greater for non-catalyst controlled vehicles (IEA/OECD,
  1998). Performance problems, cold-start ability, smooth operation and avoidance
  of vapour lock are disadvantages of using reformulated fuels. Alternative fuels
  to petroleum include compressed natural gas (CNG); liquefied petroleum gas (LPG);
  methanol from natural gas, coal or biomass; ethanol from biomass; electricity
  and hydrogen. The use of these options in reducing GHGs will depend on ease
  of use, performance and cost, however, CNG, LPG and ethanol are now used in
  niche markets (high mileage and urban travel) in both developed and developing
  countries (Sanwar et al., 1999). On a full-cycle basis, use of LPG can result
  in 20-25% reduction in GHG emissions as compared to petrol, while emission benefits
  from CNG are smaller - about 15%. Although CNG emits less CO than petrol, gains
  from CNG depend on the amount of associated methane emissions from gas recovery,
  transmission, distribution, and use. Life cycle GHG emissions from alcohol fuels,
  such as methanol and ethanol, depend on the source and conversion technology
  (DeLuchi, 1993; IEA, 1993). GHG emissions from methanol made from coal will
  be double that of petrol, whereas methanol from natural gas will be the same,
  and from wood will be lower. Ethanol from maize, wheat and sugar beet will result
  in GHG emissions of 20-110% of that of petrol depending on fertiliser inputs
  and fuel used for conversion. Ethanol from sugar yields 80% GHG emission benefits
  in comparison to petrol, and almost 100% if baggase is used instead of coal
  in conversion (Goldemberg and Macedo, 1994). The use of ethanol and CNG as transport
  fuel is shown in <a href="156.htm#b81">Boxes 8.1</a> and <a href="156.htm#b82">8.2</a>.

    <td colspan="5">Compressed natural gas (CNG) can be an attractive alternative
      transport fuel to gasoline because of its environmental benefits including
      reduction of GHGs. It is more useful for countries with natural gas resources
      and a relatively good gas distribution system. The use of CNG as a transport
      fuel started in the 1930s but failed to increase its share because, as with
      most alternatives, petroleum was a preferred fuel due to cost advantages.
      However, the current threat of climate change has increased the focus on
      alternative transport fuels including CNG. Countries with programmes on
      the use of CNG as a transport fuel include the USA, Canada, UK, Thailand,
      New Zealand, Argentina and Pakistan. CNG is used in both private vehicles
      and transport fleets. It is estimated that about 250 million vehicles are
      using this fuel worldwide, and its use is on the increase, representing
      2% of total global transport fuel use. The advantages to using CNG, beyond
      environmental ones, include reduced engine maintenance cost, and improved
      engine and fuel efficiency. Disadvantages include power loss, limited range
      of storage (100-150 km), and high cost of conversion. The environmental
      benefits relating to climate change are given in the Table below:</td>

    <td colspan="5">A case is given below to illustrate transfer of CNG technology
      between Pakistan and New Zealand. <br>
      <br>
      Pakistan has proven reserves of natural gas in excess of approximately 850
      billion m3 (90% methane, sp. gr. of 0.56, and octane of 130). The country
      embarked on using CNG as a transport fuel in 1980 with officials of the
      Hydrocarbon Development Institute of Pakistan (HDIP) visiting Italy and
      New Zealand for two years to gain experience with CNG technology. A pilot
      phase was first introduced in 1982 in Karachi, and all the compressors and
      conversion equipment was purchased in Italy and New Zealand. In 1992, the
      government, through the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources, promulgated
      the CNG Rules of 1992 that have commercialised CNG as a transport fuel in
      Pakistan. Six years later, 25 CNG stations became operational and another
      25 were at various stages of completion. Along with the Rules of 1992, the
      Gazette of Pakistan Extra of July 28, 1992 provided guidelines for the safe
      practices of CNG relating to storage, filing and distribution. Under a UNDP/ESCAP
      programme in 1991, HDIP in collaboration with Liquid Fuels Management Group
      (LFMG) of New Zealand undertook a detailed six-month field test of completely
      retrofitted buses, partially converted buses and diesel buses. The results
      revealed that CNG is environmentally better, because it was lead free, had
      no particulate matter, and very low smoke density, but the levels of CO
      and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emitted were higher than that of diesel. It was found that CNG is
      more economically and technically suitable for conversion from spark ignition
      engines, but will require major modifications for high compression diesel
      engines. Originally, all conversions were done in New Zealand, but now Pakistan
      only receives kits from there and the conversions are done by local technicians.
      Though the cost differential between CNG and gasoline is small, it is estimated
      that about 25,000 gasoline vehicles have been converted to CNG. Source:

      <p>Ethanol can be important in helping to reduce GHG emissions. The energy
	derived from biomass, and in this case, from a renewable, &quot;clean&quot;
	source, i.e., from sugar cane, has the unquestionable advantage of permitting
	the almost complete re-absorption of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emitted through the combustion
	of ethanol. This closed cycle allows, in principle, to increase the global
	energy supply, essential for sustained economic growth, without creating
	hazards for the environment. The relevance of fuel alcohol in connection
	with the global efforts for reducing CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions is singled out as one
	of the major contributors to the reduction of the greenhouse effect. It
	is important to note that, with technological advances and research, the
	price of alcohol can be made competitive with gasoline in the long run,
	but with the added advantage of providing a clean and renewable source
	of energy. </p>
      <p><b><i>Ethanol in Brazil</i></b><br>
	The National Alcohol Programme (PROALCOOL), launched in November 1975,
	in Brazil, appeared to be the answer to the dangers of oil shortages.
	The programme's objectives were to guarantee the steady supply of fuel
	in the country; substitute a motor vehicle fuel from a renewable energy
	source for imported gasoline; use the sugar cane production to its full
	potential, especially in view of the drop in the world sugar prices; diminish
	regional inequalities and promote greater rural employment; and to encourage
	technological development in connection with the production of sugar cane
	and alcohol.</p>
      <p>The programme benefited from a combination of favourable circumstances:
	the availability of adequate technology for the production of alcohol;
	the ability of the sugar sector to adjust quickly to the production of
	alcohol; the expansion of the distilleries; and the low international
	price for sugar, due to the general crisis of the sector, in part caused
	by overproduction.</p>
      <p>Until 1979, the first phase of the Programme, alcohol production concentrated
	on anhydrous alcohol (99.33% ethanol) for blending with gasoline. The
	proportions of the mixtures varied. During this period, the programme
	benefited greatly from the expanded installed capacity of the distilleries
	annexed to the sugar mills. The second phase began with the second oil
	crisis (1979), placing considerably more ambitious goals before PROALCOOL.
	A change occurred, resulting in the predominance of hydrated alcohol,
	used in pure form as car fuel. The car factories in Brazil began to design
	vehicles using fuel alcohol exclusively. The industry appeared to welcome
	the new fuel and invested in research and development of alcohol-run cars;
	given the high oil prices, fuel alcohol would permit increasing production.
	The first cars run solely on fuel alcohol were produced in 1979. By December
	1984, the number of cars run on pure hydrated alcohol reached 1,800,000,
	i.e., 17% of the country's car fleet. </p>
      <p>Fuel alcohol is a &quot;clean&quot; fuel because the local effects of
	gas emissions are less damaging to the environment, generally speaking.
	On the average, alcohol-run vehicles emit less carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons
	and sulphur. Another advantage of alcohol over gasoline is that alcohol
	replaces tetraethyl lead, which is hazardous to health and the environment,
	and is used as an additive to increase gasoline octane level. In fact,
	in the United States, alcohol is added to gasoline to diminish the high
	index of environmental pollution.<br>
	<br>
	<b><i>Ethanol in Zimbabwe</i></b><br>
	Zimbabwe, in Southern Africa, also operates an ethanol plant that was
	locally planned and is producing 40 million litres annually. As a lot
	of other developing countries, Zimbabwe had energy security problems in
	the 1970s. Petroleum products accounted for 14% of energy consumption
	and besides that the country was an exporter of sugar. At that time the
	international price of sugar was very low, so the conversion of sugar
	to ethanol was both economic and strategic.</p>
      <p>In 1975, The Triangle, a private enterprise, decided to use surplus molasses
	from up to 40,000 tonnes of sugar for ethanol production and started production
	in 1979. The German Company Gebr. Hermman supplied the plant design and
	was willing to provide a &quot;turn-key&quot; project. The Zimbabwean
	firm only purchased the plants (at a reduced price) while the German firm
	supervised its activities. Adaptation was necessary and involved discarding
	many automatic controls in favour of manual operation to suit the capabilities
	of the local workforce. Local material was utilized up to 60%, substituting
	stainless steel used in the distillation columns with approval of and
	supervision by the German firm. The final cost was US$ 6.4 million for
	a plant capable of 40 million litres a year.</p>
      <p>The ethanol produced is sold to National Oil Corporation of Zimbabwe
	and they resell it to various oil companies. Ethanol as a fuel with 13%
	blend was the only petrol available for a long period in Zimbabwe, with
	very few modifications. The plant has been operating for over 18 years
	with a lot of environmental benefits, skill transfer and technological
	adaptation as well.</p>

<p>Electric vehicles have the potential of having significant life-cycle GHG reductions
  depending on the primary energy source; the vehicle technology and method of
  use (DeLuchi, 1993; ETSU, 1994; Martin and Michaelis, 1992). Its widespread
  use will depend on battery charge/discharge efficiencies at high current, motor
  and controller efficiencies at high load, and improvements in vehicle design.
  Also, electric powered systems can be costly and inflexible. Hydrogen is a clean
  transport fuel but requires high energy input and has serious storage and cost
  problems. Development of alternative aviation fuel, such as liquefied natural
  gas (LNG) and liquid hydrogen, is going on and can result in up to 20% lower
  carbon emissions than kerosene for LNG, but is not expected to be commercial
  in the next 10 years. Details of alternative fuels are in <a href="156.htm#t84">Table 8.4</a>.</p>

<p>Recent increasing interest in the development of hybrid vehicles (combination
  of gasoline engine and battery-motor system) is yielding positive results that
  can have a positive impact on GHG reduction. Making optimum use of the different
  power supply system to suit the demand, and with an engine switch-off system
  during short breaks, up to 30% fuel efficiency gains can be achieved, as has
  been shown for models by Mitsubishi and Toyota (Tsuchiya, 1997). However, there
  are some disadvantages such as higher weight and slightly higher cost, but current
  declining cost could assist its commercial success. Use of hybrid vehicles with
  fuel cells and batteries is actively being considered by many manufacturers,
  but the cost is still very high for commercial application and may be in market
  early next century (OECD, 1997).</p>
