<h3>10.3.2 Stakeholders and pathways for energy supply technology transfer</h3>
<p> <i>Efficiency improvement</i><br>
  The actors involved in the four sectors listed under efficiency improvements
  in <a href="197.htm#t102">Table 10.2</a> are diverse and require different approaches
  for purposes of technology transfer policy. Yet problems of energy efficiency
  improvement in developing and transitional economies share some basic characteristics
  with efficiency improvements in other areas of resource use. Few technologies
  are operated at design specifications right from the start, and their performance
  generally tends to diminish as time goes by. This observation is particularly
  relevant for advanced technology with low operational tolerance levels. The
  reasons have to do with system-wide deficiencies such as inadequate maintenance
  discipline and lack of spare parts. They are not unique for certain technologies.
  A brief outline of the actors and pathways involved in the four areas of potential
  efficiency gain follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The oil and gas sector is a mature, globally oriented industry involving
    not only the large multinationals, but also a complex network of specialised
    suppliers of equipment and services. In many developing and transitional economies
    local companies are tied into this network. The preferred pathway for technology
    transfer is clearly through private sector contracts in many forms, from licensing
    to foreign direct investment. The government role is primarily limited to
    enabling actions having to do with establishing a stable and competitive economic
    climate. Given the huge investments in oil and gas production, refineries
    and pipelines, geopolitical considerations play a major role and the risks
    of not recovering investments is potentially high. Major gains in efficiency
    improvement are possible given the right incentive structure for private firms.</li>
  <li> In contrast to the oil and gas industry, coal industries, with some notable
    exceptions, are more nationally oriented even in Europe, and technology transfer
    flows primarily through government driven pathways. The industry also has
    a long historical record in some key developing countries, particularly in
    India and China. Indeed, where the lack of vested interests may hamper efficiency
    improvement in the oil and gas sector, the opposite may be the case where
    coal is concerned. The position of domestic firms in emerging economies is
    strong, but investments in conversion efficiency improvements and technological
    innovation are insufficient to reach internationally accepted standards of
    performance. In those economies large efficiency gains throughout the chain
    from mining and bulk transportation to steam and power generation are potentially
    available. Sector restructuring is in many cases necessary to create competitive
    conditions and improve performance. Incentives for domestic mining companies
    and equipment manufacturers to actively seek cooperation with foreign firms
    are needed. Local coal R&amp;D activities form a necessary component of technology
    transfer policies. Stimulation of joint ventures and foreign direct investment
    would involve better protection of proprietary information, support for licensing
    agreements, removal of import restrictions, and adequate enforcement of environmental
    standards. </li>
  <li> Like the coal industry, power generation has been an almost exclusively
    domestic affair in most countries for a long time. The past decade has seen
    a major change in the orientation of this sector because of a global wave
    of liberalisation and privatisation. At the same time electricity demand growth
    in the OECD has been slow (Price et al., 1998). These factors have led to
    an increasing international orientation of the major players in the industry,
    ranging from equipment suppliers to former public utilities. On the other
    hand, electricity supply (both in terms of total load and reliability) in
    most developing countries cannot keep up with demand, and this is becoming
    a major constraint on economic development. The gradual decoupling of public
    policies and political interests from utility regulation and electricity markets
    will have a profound impact on the future performance of the sector. The initial
    drive in this process must come from the government. Restructured national
    utilities whether in private or public hands can then involve the private
    sector through independent power producers or other forms of partnerships
    in efforts to improve efficiencies in generation, transport and distribution.
  </li>
  <li> Cogeneration (combined heat and power application) has had a major impact
    on energy efficiency improvements in many OECD countries (IEA, 1997). Without
    a proper regulatory framework and special tariff constructions, cogeneration
    will be difficult to implement in many cases. Although cogeneration projects
    are based on private sector initiatives and pathways, the public sector has
    to play a major enabling role.</li>
</ul>
<p> <i>Switching to low-carbon fuels</i><br>
  The major option for switching to low-carbon fuels is replacing coal or oil
  with natural gas. The natural gas sector is dominated by the oil and gas multinationals,
  global pipeline construction companies and major gas equipment manufacturers.
  It is a mature industry characterised by gradual technological innovation in
  the last decade primarily on the production and conversion ends of the resource
  flow (off-shore operations and gas turbine technology). Core technologies in
  this chain are typically R&amp;D intensive and logistically complex, and thus
  not easily transferred to domestic firms. There are, however, substantial opportunities
  for peripheral supplies during construction, and once installed operation and
  maintenance can be transferred relatively easily. The projects involved are
  politically highly visible and of the front page news type. This makes a stable
  gas market regime essential for attracting capital at reasonable conditions.
  Besides technical skills of construction and operation such projects require
  entrepreneurial and bargaining skills at the recipient end to balance interests
  competently. Natural gas markets and applications are a relatively new phenomenon
  in most developing countries, and thus need considerable policy attention when
  it comes to building up required skills and supplier industries. Regional cooperation
  is an essential element of success in transnational gas ventures, because a
  large part of the supply costs are in infrastructural investments with high
  risks of recovery.<br>
  <i><br>
  Decarbonisation of Fuels or Flue Gases, and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> Storage</i><br>
  The actors involved in CO<span class="subscript">2</span> removal and storage
  will first be oil and gas companies and perhaps later electric utilities. Because
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> becomes available in pure form in some petrochemical
  complexes (hydrogen, methanol and ammonia production), and because CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  stripping from natural gas fields is necessary to meet commercial fuel specifications,
  oil and gas companies are facing just the costs of storage. If, in addition,
  the injected CO<span class="subscript">2</span> improves recovery rates in production
  from natural gas and coal beds, niche applications can even be attractive when
  carbon emission taxes are low. Removing CO<span class="subscript">2</span> from
  natural gas (e.g. steam reforming) or from flue gas in power plants is an expensive
  add-on technology, while new integrated technologies like coal gasification
  or synfuels with undiluted CO<span class="subscript">2</span> flows are not
  commercial. Technology transfer concerning this option could involve both North-North
  and North-South partnerships. At the same time large-scale CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  storage arrangements without commercial benefits will require government-driven
  technology transfer pathways. <br>
  <br>
  <i>Nuclear power</i><br>
  Nuclear planned capacity additions in the past few years were located primarily
  in Asia. Moreover, considerations of operational safety and waste management
  have led to considerable involvement of industrial countries in nuclear power
  plant upgrading in transitionary economies. From the point of view of technology
  transfer these developments cannot be ignored. Governmental organisations at
  the national and international level are the most important stakeholders in
  this respect, as are the major engineering and construction companies involved
  in nuclear energy. In general, nuclear power requires an elaborate national
  regulatory and technical infrastructure, and affects key international political
  issues. The major pathways for technology transfer in this area are thus strongly
  government-driven and embedded in international agreements. With respect to
  operation of existing nuclear power plants, measures to strengthen and improve
  technology transfer in the areas of plant safety, personnel training, and the
  nuclear fuel cycle are needed.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Biomass</i><br>
  Biomass technology for energy generation or fuel production is the most complex
  cluster of the six major options listed in <a href="197.htm#t102">Table 10.2</a>.
  First of all, biomass technology is still evolving, which makes it difficult
  to decide what exactly should be transferred in terms of knowledge and techniques.
  Secondly, biomass technology requires an interconnecting series of difficult
  technological choices concerning biomass sources and production, biomass handling
  and transportation, and biomass conversion and end use. These choices are to
  a large degree area-specific and cannot realistically be addressed on a generic
  level. Finally, there are a multitude of actors who potentially could become
  crucial players in global markets. Nevertheless, at least for some developing
  countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, biomass energy may become the most
  important opportunity on a community level for economic development in an environmentally
  conscious world. The Brazilian alcohol programme (see <a href="336.htm">Case
  Study 8</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>) testifies to this observation
  despite its present economic difficulties (Moreira and Goldemberg, 1999). Biomass
  technology transfer under current conditions is mostly dependent on government
  driven pathways, such as active involvement in R&amp;D activities, demonstration
  projects financed locally or internationally, and government sponsored programmes
  to determine the resource availability. An example is the joint USA-China effort
  to develop a biomass resource database (Zhu, 1998). Such efforts are necessary
  to prepare the ground for large-scale involvement at a later stage<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#4" onClick="showFootnote(11,4); return false;">4</a></small></sup>
  . The development of biomass energy options can also promote incremental carbon
  sequestration. <br>
  <br>
  <i>Hydroelectricity </i><br>
  Hydroelectricity is the largest source of renewable energy now being used. Technology
  transfer is occurring as shown by the intensive programme of hydro plant construction
  in several developing countries. Unfortunately, local impacts due to the use
  of rivers for other purposes, and the social problems related with population
  displacement for water storage are making it difficult to justify large-scale
  hydroelectricity as environmentally sustainable, unless several complementary
  measures are added to the projects (Liebenthal et al., 1996). Hydroelectricity
  generation, like most renewable energy technologies, is capital intensive which
  can be an important financial barrier. The electric sector is, however, now
  searching for low cost alternatives because of economic pressures due to de-regulation
  or to privatisation. Run-of-the-river, small-scale hydro and pumped-storage
  hydros are being considered as more sustainable alternatives to the use of large
  scale hydroelectricity, despite reducing significantly the available economic
  potential (Moreira and Poole, 1993).<br>
  <br>
  <i>Small-scale renewables</i><br>
  Small-scale sources for renewable electricity based on wind or PV have been
  popular items of technology transfer programmes since the early 1970s. Only
  in recent years have these led to impressive success stories such as the penetration
  of wind parks in India and Mongolia (see <a href="331.htm">Case Study 3</a>,
  <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>) or the penetration of solar home systems in
  Kenya (see <a href="333.htm">Case Study 5</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>).
  These technologies are to a large extent dependent on specific niche markets
  created through government intervention, combined with the entrepreneurial spirit
  of the involved communities. Yet they hold great potential for the immediate
  future. In general, the main actors in the world market are equipment manufacturers
  from industrialised countries, who try to penetrate worldwide through a variety
  of cooperative agreements with counterparts in developing countries and strong
  reliance on international aid funds. Their role is increasingly challenged by
  domestic manufacturers. Because these technologies are generally purchased by
  end users rather than power producers, arrangements with respect to marketing,
  financing, and after-sales services on the local community level are just as
  important as technical performance and manufacturing capability. Without competent
  intermediaries the chances of successful market penetration are low no matter
  the origin and performance of the product. The necessary involvement of a large
  number of people distributed over a large area makes technology transfer for
  renewable electricity difficult and requires continuous government intervention
  to increase awareness and institutional commitment, and to stimulate appropriate
  education and technical facilities. <br>
