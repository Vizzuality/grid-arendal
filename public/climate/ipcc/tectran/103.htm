<h3>5.3.3 Potential Financial Solutions</h3>
<p> Slow diffusion together with the consideration of cost and availability of
  finance suggest that there is potential for innovation and focus to help support
  and accelerate the transfer of environmentally sound technology. In particular,
  certain types of finance appear to offer particular potential for helping to
  finance the transfer of technology, although they may require adaptation to
  the specific issue; it is worth considering these in more detail. (Mansely et
  al., 1997a and b).The public-private partnerships discussed in <a href="116.htm">Section
  5.6</a> can play a role in developing and implementing these solutions.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Project finance.</b> Project finance is the packaging of investment into
  specific, stand-alone projects. Notably there is only limited recourse to other
  parties (e.g., the promoters and financiers) if the project runs into difficulties,
  so the project has to stand on its own merits. Of particular relevance to climate
  change are energy projects, which are frequently financed this way. Project
  finance uses a range of finance instruments and typically consists of a mixture
  of debt (normally secured loans) and equity (strategic investors and institutions).
  Project finance aims to reduce risks and thus financing costs through a series
  of robust contracts, notably to charge for the services provided (e.g., power).
  Negotiating these contracts can be difficult and time consuming. Often there
  can be some flexibility over ownership of the facility - such as build-operate-transfer
  (BOT) structures. One key issue for climate change technologies is the need
  to achieve a certain scale. To justify the transaction costs involved, project
  finance normally requires sums of US$20 million and above. This can restrict
  its applicability in many areas such as renewable energy and energy efficiency
  where only few projects in certain sectors reach this size. Project finance
  is particularly relevant to government-driven pathways, and to the transport,
  energy, solid waste and coastal zone adaptation sectors.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Leasing.</b> Leasing is a highly flexible form of finance used throughout
  business to finance everything from photocopiers to aircraft. In 1994 over US$350
  billion of new equipment, machinery and vehicles were financed through leasing,
  and some US$44 billion in developing economies. It is often packaged as a form
  of sales financing - i.e., it helps customers of a company buy that company's
  equipment. Despite higher spreads than conventional lending, leasing offers
  several advantages such as simplified security arrangements, convenience and
  speed, flexibility, low transaction costs and frequently tax advantages. The
  principle constraint on the development of leasing has been access to local
  currency medium-term lending. MDBs, notably the IFC, have been active in promoting
  leasing businesses and have found it to be a successful form of investment (Carter,
  1996). Leasing offers potential to be a major source of finance for the transfer
  of EST, particularly to the business community (private-sector-driven pathways).
  Leasing has been used to buy various types of environmental technology from
  monitoring equipment to wind turbines, although it has not been possible to
  identify any leasing company focusing specifically on environmental technology.
  There is scope to encourage leasing companies to support the transfer of EST
  through selective tax incentives, information sharing and bringing together
  environmental entrepreneurs and leasing companies. Leasing is particularly relevant
  to the private-sector-driven pathways, although it can be used by governments,
  and especially the industrial sector, although it can be used in several other
  sectors. <br>
  <br>
  An example of an established and successful leasing company that focuses specifically
  on environmental technology is Towarzystwo Inwestycyjno-Leasingowe Ekoleasing
  S.A. (joint stock company Investment and Leasing Society Ekoleasing) in Poland.
  It was established in 1993. Currently the share capital is almost US$1 million.
  Over 40% of the total value of PLZ 33 million (about US$9 million) of contracts
  concluded in 1998 was leasing of specifically environmental technologies.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Private equity from strategic investors.</b> Strategic investors, often in
  the form of multinational corporations, have the potential to be major investors
  in technology transfer. As large organisations they have ready access to finance.
  As well as using capital internally they can also act as external investors,
  investing in projects or businesses. They look for a financial return but also
  usually expect other business benefits, such as a role as supplier to a project
  or investing in a joint venture as a way to gain access to new markets. They
  frequently bring additional skills and expertise as well as finance. They are
  major suppliers of equity to many energy projects already, and with many major
  companies becoming increasingly interested in climate change (such as Enron,
  BP and Shell) are increasingly investing in renewable and clean energy internationally.
  This type of investor is also the most interested in the flexibility mechanisms
  of the Kyoto Protocol, as indicated by their participation in the various precursor
  instruments such as joint implementation and the Carbon Investment Fund, probably
  because they can see benefits beyond the strictly financial ones.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Portfolio investment.</b> For listed companies in developing countries, issuing
  new stock is an option for raising capital that can be attractive. Doing so
  enables risk capital to be raised, without involving loss of control, for example
  to overseas partners, and enables investment in several needed areas, which
  may include energy efficiency or environmental technologies, without changes
  to management or business structure. However, the vast majority of portfolio
  investors will place little direct importance on the investment in environmental
  technologies, and will instead consider more general aspects of the firm and
  management's track record when deciding to purchase the new shares. Furthermore,
  the ability to raise such capital cannot be guaranteed, and depends on market
  conditions and on the company's performance at the time.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Venture capital.</b> Venture capital is particularly relevant to the development
  and transfer of new technologies. Venture capitalists are prepared to back risky
  investments in return for high returns and will invest in small companies, such
  as those who have developed new technology, and/or have difficulties raising
  capital from most other investors. Venture capitalists have a relatively long-term
  focus, aiming to hold companies for several years before selling them, and have
  a more active approach than most other types of investors, in terms of participating
  in management of the company. This means they can play an active role in supporting
  technology transfer if it forms part of the business development plans of their
  investee companies. Venture capital is largest in the US but has grown recently
  in the rest of the world, including in developing countries where multilateral
  institutions have provided substantial support. Venture capitalists have tended
  to focus on high-return sectors such as computer software and biotechnology,
  and to date only a relatively small amount of finance has gone into environmental
  business, and only a few funds focus on environmental ventures. Indeed, the
  environmental sector has had a very mixed track record in delivering returns
  to investors. However, there is growing interest in venture capital funds with
  an environmental focus and a number are expected to be launched in coming years.
  Venture capital is predominantly relevant to private-sector-driven pathways,
  and especially important in the industrial sector, with some relevance in the
  transport and energy sectors. It does require a relatively sophisticated financial
  infrastructure.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Micro-credit. </b>Micro-credit is the provision of small amounts of finance
  to individuals. While the basic concept is the same as traditional banking,
  the attitude to risk is radically different, because micro-credit institutions
  are prepared to lend to those ignored by conventional financial institutions
  - those on low incomes or with no assets. A particular emphasis is on enabling
  access. It is often provided by non-conventional financial intermediaries such
  as cooperatives, farmers' associations and distributors. Micro-credit has been
  successful in many areas now and is receiving increasing attention from Multilateral
  Financial Institutions as a way of encouraging development (Ledgerwood, 1999).
  Many believe there is substantial scope for adapting and focusing micro-credit
  to finance the uptake of ESTs at the household level. However, others have argued
  that micro-credit is generally not suitable for environmental technologies.
  because the credit is usually short-term (less than 1 year), comes with high
  interest rates, is limited to small amounts (US$100, whereas a solar home system
  might cost US$600) and is not granted for capital investments (van Berkel and
  Bouma, 1999).</p>
