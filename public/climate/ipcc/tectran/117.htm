<h3>5.6.1 The Value of Technology Intermediaries</h3>
<p> The need for intermediation to overcome transaction barriers is often discussed
  in the context of technology development, both internationally and in purely
  domestic contexts. The World Resources Institute (Heaton et al., 1994) has proposed
  sector-specific intermediation as an important policy goal for greater international
  technology transfer, development and cooperation:<br>
  <br>
  In intermediation, third parties create linkages, transmit knowledge, and expedite
  other transactions for the principals. The greater the barriers that separate
  parties who could create relationships of mutual benefit, the greater the need
  for intermediation. In technology development, the value of intermediation is
  well recognised. (p.20)<br>
  <br>
  Evidence to-date with institutions that perform some intermediary functions
  shows that sector-specific intermediaries have advantages over broad, general-purpose
  intermediaries, because the technologies and applications involved are simply
  too diverse. A consequence is that intermediaries for energy efficiency and
  renewable energy should to some extent be specialised. In this view, many or
  most or the actors are already in existence and working, but communication and
  new, and more specific, problem-solving capacities are required.<br>
  <br>
  Others have called technology intermediaries bridging institutions. Dodgson
  and Bessant (1996) highlight the importance of the intermediaries that operate
  between users and suppliers of technology and which help to create the links
  within networks and systems. They say that &quot;bridging institutions...encourage
  interaction within the system, assisting with undertaking search, evaluation
  and dissemination tasks. They ensure that technological know-how is broadly
  dispersed within the system and can provide a compensating mechanism for weaknesses
  or 'holes' in the system&quot; (p. 26). Innovation agents are another name for
  intermediaries(Dodgson and Bessant, 1996, p.186).<br>
  <br>
  The high value of technology intermediation is illustrated by many of the case
  studies presented throughout this report. In the Baltic States, the Swedish
  government aid agency NUTEK promoted conversion of heating boilers to biomass
  by bringing boiler operators and manufacturers of conversion equipment together,
  by providing financing for the conversions, and by providing assistance to boiler
  operators in financial and technical analysis, competitive procurement, and
  contracting (see <a href="346.htm">Case Study 18</a>). In Mexico, the national
  electric utility played an intermediary role by marketing and selling efficient
  lighting through its offices, and by reducing the retail price through bulk
  procurement (see <a href="096.htm">Section 5.2.1</a>). In East Africa, the promotion
  and dissemination of improved efficiency cookstoves was facilitated by small-scale
  informal-sector entrepreneurs providing sales and service (see <a href="329.htm">Case
  Study 1</a>). <br>
  <br>
  In countries with economies in transition (CEITs), technology intermediaries
  are important ways to overcome the lack of business, financing and marketing
  skills among firms whose managers never learned these skills in the centrally
  planned economy (because these skills were not needed). In particular, energy
  service companies, financial intermediaries and information centres have been
  playing important technology intermediation roles for climate-friendly technologies
  in many CEITs (discussed in more detail in the sections below). In CEITs, because
  of generally well developed technical skills among enterprises, intermediaries
  can focus on business, information, and financing services (Evans and Legro,
  1997; Martinot <i>et al.,</i> 1997; Martinot, 1998; Marousek <i>et al.,</i>
  1998).<br>
  <br>
  In many rural photovoltaic programmes, a local or foreign intermediary provides 
  critical marketing activities, education, financing or leasing mechanisms, sales 
  and service infrastructure that helps to create a market. In the Dominican Republic, 
  an innovative leasing programme by SOLUZ has successfully transferred PV technology. 
  In Kenya, a network of dealers, along with education and training programmes 
  have resulted in 80,000 solar home systems in use (see <a href="333.htm">Case 
  Study 5</a>). In Bangladesh, the Grameen bank has successfully provided micro-credit 
  for solar photovoltaic home systems (see <a href="102.htm#b53">Box 5.3</a>). 
  The World Bank and GEF have recently incorporated innovative intermediary mechanisms 
  into solar PV home system projects in China, Indonesia, and Argentina, reflecting 
  the World Bank's increased focus on rural energy for development (World Bank, 
  1997).<br>
  <br>
  Technology intermediaries also can play an important role in strengthening the
  enabling environments for technology transfer discussed in <a href="051.htm">Chapter
  4</a>. In particular, they can help to establish codes and standards locally
  or nationally, they can help facilitate programmes that create sustainable markets
  for environmentally sound technologies, and they can influence regulatory conditions
  and macroeconomic policies.</p>
