<h3>2.2.5 Commercial Sales</h3>
<p><i>Issues</i><br>
  The OECD has estimated that three quarters of international technology transfer
  arises from trade. Certainly much private sector technology transfer takes place
  on a commercial basis, with companies investing in new, upgraded, or expanded
  facilities purchasing the requisite technology from either domestic or foreign
  suppliers. Although funds for the purchase of equipment and training in its
  use can come from many of the sources described earlier, they may also come
  from retained earnings, commercial loans from banks in the same country, and
  other non-international sources. Such funding is particularly relevant to small
  and medium-sized companies that do not have access to international finance.
  Related private sector flows of an international commercial nature result from
  payments for intellectual property rights, related specialised services (such
  as consulting services), and payments arising from strategic partnerships between
  unaffiliated companies (UNCTAD, 1998; WBCSD, 1998).</p>
<p><i>Trends</i><br>
  It is difficult to assemble a comprehensive picture about international trade
  and technology transfer. Most government export promotion programmes are not
  transparent, and it is difficult to gather information about the projects they
  support (and often make possible). The World Bank assembles data on high technology
  exports for its World Development Index, but admits that the methodology &quot;rests
  on a somewhat unrealistic assumption&quot; (World Bank, 1998a). Not surprisingly,
  the data show that the OECD and &quot;Asian Tiger&quot; countries dominate the
  export of high technology goods, both in absolute amounts and as a percentage
  of total exports. Data on importing countries is not provided. UNCTAD (1998)
  notes, however, that imports of capital goods have consistently represented
  between 20 per cent and 40 per cent of gross domestic investment in Asian newly
  industrialising economies, although the percentage relevant to climate change
  cannot be determined.</p>
<p>Better data exist about payments for foreign royalty and license fees. As reported
  by the IMF in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook, (World Bank, 1998c),
  developing countries and CEITs made payments in excess of US$7.3 billion and
  received in turn US$1.2 billion in royalty and license fees in 1997. This category
  covers patents, copyrights, trademarks, industrial processes, and franchises,
  and for the use, through licensing agreements, of products made from prototypes,
  such as manuscripts and films. Some of these, but not all, are presumed to be
  related to the transfer of technology. </p>
