  <b>Summary</b><br>
  A Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) project to decrease greenhouse emissions was 
  taken up by Innoprise Corporation in the forest of Sabah, Malaysia, with financial 
  aid from a US utility. Malaysian foresters were trained for RIL operations, 
  and an independent team monitored and verified project activities. The associated 
  reduction in carbon emissions was estimated at 65tC/ha over the logging cycle 
  of the coupe at an estimated cost of US$4/tC. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background</b><br>
  The carbon-offset project for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through RIL 
  was initiated by Innoprise Corporation (ICSB, Malaysia) in August 1992 with 
  financial aid from the US-based New England Electric System (NEES). RIL, in 
  contrast to conventional logging, maintains the capacity of forests to sequester 
  carbon because of the reduced number of trees logged. This reduces biomass losses 
  and decreases carbon emissions from the decay of logging debris.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective</b><br>
  This project aimed at demonstrating reductions in carbon emissions from logging 
  activities. The project also included field studies for quantifying carbon storage 
  and fluxes; development of a model to simulate changes in biomass and carbon 
  pools following logging and a simple projection model to generate an estimate 
  of the carbon benefit. <br>
  <b><br>
  Approach</b><br>
  Training in RIL techniques: Traditionally, Malaysian forest rangers are trained 
  in mensuration and inventory methods, with limited expertise in harvesting techniques. 
  Sawyers and bulldozer drivers receive no explicit training although they are 
  apprenticed for several years. The RIL project sponsored training at several 
  levels in the forest department. One of the first project activities was a visit 
  by senior Innoprise staff and logging contractors to areas managed by the Queensland 
  Forest Service in Australia. Several of the Australian foresters who trained 
  the logging contractors then visited Sabah as advisors for implementing RIL 
  guidelines. Ten tractor drivers and 15 ICSB field staff worked with experienced 
  Australian foresters for three weeks. During this training period, timber in 
  a logging block of approximately 50 ha was harvested. During two five-day training 
  programmes, sawyers were trained by a Swedish specialist in directional felling.<br>
  Monitoring: Compliance with the RIL guidelines and verification of reduction 
  in logging damage was assessed by an independent team comprised of NEES, ICSB 
  and the Center for International Forestry Research. The team conducted site 
  inspections and met the ground staff, and verified the records and calculations 
  of the logging damage studies and of the carbon offsets. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Impacts</b><br>
  The associated reduction in carbon emissions and enhanced sequestration is estimated 
  at 65 tC/ha over the logging cycle of the coupe, at an estimated cost of less 
  than US$4/tC. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  The pilot project brought together NEES, ICSB and the Queensland Forest Service. 
  NEES gained the capacity to plan and implement international carbon-offset projects 
  in anticipation of US legal requirements to control emissions from its coal-based 
  power plants. NEES financing enabled the transfer of RIL expertise and technology 
  from the Queensland Forest Service to ICSB. ICSB gained funds to train staff; 
  the opportunity to improve harvesting practices in a part of their 1 million-hectare, 
  99-year concession; and the increase in value of residual forest in the project 
  area. The financing paid the costs of training operators and implementing improved 
  harvesting practices. However, the sustainability of RIL is not guaranteed because 
  of the lack of continuing financial incentives. The expansion of RIL is likely 
  to depend on acceptance of the Clean Development Mechanism by both developed 
  and developing countries. However, RIL is not easy to classify under the three 
  defined activities (reforestation, afforestation and deforestation) currently 
  allowed under the Kyoto Protocol in the Land Use Change and Forestry Sector.<br>
  <br>
  The people most responsible for the RIL success were the ICSB forest rangers. 
  The rangers participated in all the RIL activities. They not only consistently 
  used good judgement in implementing the guidelines, but also suggested a number 
  of innovations that were incorporated into the project, including excellent 
  methods for record keeping. The trained forest rangers may serve as future instructors, 
  a situation that can offer considerable advantage in effectiveness, cost and 
  ease of implementation.<br>
