<h3>4.5.5 Capacity building for adaptation</h3>
  Increasing attention has been paid to the need to develop measures to cope with
  the climate change already contained within systems. How far such measures will
  need to go depends on: the magnitude and extent of climate change; the rates
  of accumulation of greenhouse gases; and, the level of stabilisation of the
  atmosphere to be achieved. Experiences with recent climate variability have
  given urgency to the adaptation agenda as it moves to its second stage in the
  FCCC process, particularly for the least developed countries and the small island
  states (SIS) amongst them because of their vulnerability. The SIS called for
  an acceleration of efforts at the UNGASS in October 1999. Few developing countries
  (or developed countries) have yet fully assessed their vulnerability to climate
  change and developed adaptation strategies. <br>
  <br>
  Comparatively little consideration has been given in a systematic way to what
  capacity building is required for Annex II countries for adaptation. There are
  well developed methodologies as to how to assess the impacts from and potential
  adaptations to climate change (see, for example, Parry and Carter, 1998) but
  these may not be appropriate as a basis for assessing priorities for action
  by national governments of developing countries without modification and interpretation.
  The methods were originally developed for assessments of discrete climate impacts,
  not how to cope with future climate change at the local to regional level. And,
  the perspective of a national policymaker with limited resources, seeking to
  set priorities for research and then action, is inadequately covered. Existing
  approaches for evaluating adaptation often are methods and models designed for
  specific sectors or complex integrated assessment models (see, for example,
  UNEP and IVM, 1998). Skills, time and resources may not be available to apply
  such techniques and they may not produce required outputs. There may be too
  many players in 'traditional' studies: sponsors, researchers and the target
  community to produce an integrated package without coordination. Capacity-building,
  including substantive changes to social structures or planning paradigms, is
  often ignored in favour of evaluating discrete options, such as the cost-effectiveness
  of a higher sea wall. Weaknesses of these approaches have already been recognised
  in some national initiatives such as the UK Climate Impacts Programme, where
  emphasis is placed on facilitating stakeholder engagement to ensure policymakers
  get useful outputs.<br>
  <br>
The Programmes sponsored in host countries, such as the US Country studies programme,
the UNEP/GEF Country case studies on Climate Change Impacts and Adaptations Assessment
and the Netherlands Climate Change Assistance Programme have started work with
many countries on impacts and adaptation assessment and in the case of the US
Country studies programme, already provided significant capacity building for
professionals and institutions (Dixon, 1998). In addition, UNDP's Support Programme
for National Communications is starting work on vulnerability and adaptation assessments.
In recognition of the gaps that exist, the SBSTA has asked the UNFCCC Secretariat
to continue to develop its website relating to decision tools, models and methodologies
to evaluate impacts and adaptation strategies (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.12). Within the
adaptation rather than mitigation agenda, it would seem there is particular need
for more support to ensure the scientific datasets, tools and skills are readily
available in-country, for the undertaking of impact assessments, particularly
climatological data and regional climate models. Impact studies are the basic
building blocks for the identification of vulnerability and to enable the formulation
of adaptation options. There may also be a need to establish internationally agreed
approaches if funds are to be disbursed in the future on the basis of vulnerability
indices.<br>
