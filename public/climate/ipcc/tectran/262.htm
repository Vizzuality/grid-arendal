<h3> 13.4.1 Barriers </h3>

<p>In recent years, attention has focused on the limitations of past waste management
  investments and the identification of more effective means of technology transfer.
  The principal barriers to technology transfer in the waste management sector
  have been discussed more fully elsewhere (see, for example, IPCC, 1996b WGII,
  TP1; Bartone, 1997; Serageldin, 1994). Briefly, the principal barriers within
  countries include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Limited financing: Developing basic infrastructure to collect and treat
    solid waste and wastewater can be extremely expensive. Frequently, those regions
    where the lack of waste management is felt most severely are also some of
    the poorest and fastest growing. Local governments often find that they cannot
    generate the investment required, and availability of private financing for
    these types of projects can be limited, particularly if the recipient governments
    are not considered &quot;credit-worthy.&quot; <a href="347.htm">Case Study
    19</a>, in <a href="318.htm">Section III</a>, gives an example of a financial
    barrier.</li>
  <li> Limited Institutional Capabilities: Waste management systems require well
    developed institutional frameworks to ensure that waste is collected as expected,
    disposal and treatment facilities are operated and maintained effectively,
    and revenues collected. </li>
  <li> Jurisdictional complexity: Effective waste management involves different
    levels of government (local, state or provincial, and national), as well as
    different departments within a jurisdiction. Conflicting and competing priorities
    can impede the efficient development and implementation of systems.</li>
  <li> Need for Community Involvement: Ultimately, the success of a waste management
    system depends upon the willingness of the public to use it. Unfortunately,
    many waste management projects have historically focused on large, centralised
    infrastructure investments and have either ignored the role of the community
    or included it too late in the process. The results of such investments have
    been poorly designed or ill-suited projects lacking public support. Indeed,
    reviews of waste management projects have indicated that sustainability and
    performance improve to the degree that end-users are involved in the design
    and financing of the project (Serageldin, 1994). </li>
</ul>
<p> <br>
  Mitigation projects can be successfully integrated into larger waste management
  efforts provided they are able to meet the needs and priorities of end-users,
  decision-makers, and financial supporters. However, mitigation projects may
  confront additional barriers, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Lack of familiarity with the potential to reduce methane generation or
    capture the methane emissions associated with waste management; </li>
  <li> Unwillingness or inability to commit additional human or financial resources
    to investigating and addressing the climactic implications of the waste management
    project; and</li>
  <li> Additional institutional complexity when new groups, representing issues
    such as energy generation or byproduct marketing, are incorporated into the
    project.</li>
</ul>
