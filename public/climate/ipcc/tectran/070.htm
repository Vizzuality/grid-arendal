<h1> 4.6 Macroeconomic Policy Framework</h1>
<p>
  Barriers to technology transfer resulting from macroeconomic conditions include
  lack of access to capital, a poorly developed banking sector, lack of available
  long-term capital, high or uncertain inflation or interest rates, subsidised
  or average-cost (rather than marginal-cost) prices for energy, high import duties,
  uncertain stability of tax and tariff policies, investment risk (real and perceived),
  and risk of expropriation. Policy tools related to macroeconomic conditions
  to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) and access to technology can include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Macroeconomic stability, such as low inflation and stable and realistic
    currency</li>
  <li> Deregulation of the investment regime, and free movement of private capital</li>
  <li> Foreign exchange convertibility and liberalisation of exchange restrictions</li>
  <li> Removal of (often prohibitive) restrictions on repatriation of profits
    and of capital</li>
  <li> Reduction of risk of expropriation</li>
  <li> Reduction of the role of the public sector in directly productive sectors,
    through privatisation of state enterprises and overall reduction of the share
    of stateenterprises in total investment, by opening up the public utility
    sector and other public monopolies to private sector participation and foreign
    investment </li>
  <li> Provisions for the settlement of disputes ranging from direct negotiation
    among the disputing parties to third party arbitration (World Bank, 1997a)</li>
  <li> Removal of mandated local ownership requirements </li>
  <li> Promotion of the development of domestic institutional investors to assuage
    public fears about excessive foreign presence and to reduce the vulnerability
    of domestic capital markets to foreign investor herding. The presence of domestic
    institutional investors also reassures foreign investors about the host country's
    respect for corporate governance and property rights (World Bank 1997a)<br>
  </li>
  <li> Reform of opaque regulations that leave much administrative discretion
    and scope for corruption which discourages investment flows (Shang-Jin Wei
    1997).</li>
  <li> Streamlining and reduction of tax rates to competitive levels. Low tax
    rates have been found associated with high levels of direct foreign investment
    (Hines and Rice, 1994).</li>
  <li> Mobilisation of domestic resources through the gradual reduction of environmentally
    damaging subsidies (Panayotou, 1997).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For the buildings, industrial, and energy sectors, the low price of conventional
  energy is a barrier that deters investment in alternatives. Different forms
  of levy to 'internalise' the environmental costs of fossil fuel use are now
  being tried to improve the competitiveness of the cleaner energy sources (Dale
  1995), but this may increase perceived policy vulnerability. If the new technology
  is saving on scarce inputs or substitutes for dirty fuels which are subsidised,
  the technology may not be locally attractive even if it is globally preferable.
  Pricing of both the new technology and its complements and substitutes is just
  as important . The channels may be open but effective demand may be lacking
  because of inefficient pricing or other domestic distortions (Dale 1995). <br>
  <br>
  The lack of financing for technology transfer can reflect the lack of capacity
  on the part of the financial sector in developing countries (Manas 1990). Further
  efforts are needed to convince banks and other lending institutions of the profitability
  of financing environmentally sound technologies and projects. Innovative financing
  mechanisms that allow reduced risks to lenders but allow profitable investments
  in environmentally sound technologies are one of the main impediments for greater
  energy efficiency in most of the developing countries (Pachauri and Bhandari,
  1994). Most lending activities in developing countries are geared to corporate
  finance, not project finance.<br>
  <br>
  The banking system plays a dominant role in the allocation of capital, and its
  health largely determines whether a country will be able to exploit the benefits
  of financial integration, including access to and transfer of technology. Banking
  systems in many countries exhibit characteristics that can adversely affect
  long-term investment, imports<br>
  of capital goods and technology transfer, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Excessive banking regulation or inadequate banking supervision</li>
  <li> Incentives for banks that are distorted against risk taking</li>
  <li> Banks that are poorly capitalised</li>
  <li> Inadequate regulation and oversight</li>
  <li> Incentive distortions (e.g. excessive insurance)</li>
  <li> Surges in capital flows that expose the banking system to risk and vulnerability
  </li>
</ul>
<p>These problems can be addressed through macroeconomic policies, increased reserve
  requirements and/or adoption of risk-weighted capital adequacy requirements
  (World Bank 1997a). It is necessary to build shock absorbers into the financial
  system and develop mechanisms to respond to instability by:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Maintaining international reserves at levels commensurate with the variation
    of capital account; the lower the confidence of foreign investors, the larger
    the reserves need to be; they could also be</li>
  <li> Buttressed through contingent lines of credit (e.g. Argentina)</li>
  <li> Maintaining fiscal flexibility</li>
  <li> Building cushions in the banking system by using periods of credit booms
    to increase bank capitalisation.</li>
</ul>
<p> Most modern economies comprise a mix between government and private sector
  investments which varies according to the nature of the economic system and
  circumstances, and it has varied over time. Traditionally governments, as well
  as their role in social infrastructure (education, health) have dominated investment
  in physical infrastructure and large-scale technology development (Rama 1997).
  In mixed economies, government finance has dominated where the benefits are
  not readily in the form of financial returns, or where such returns are likely
  to be very long term (as with technology development) (World Bank 1997a). In
  addition governments have traditionally been heavily involved in sectors that
  are perceived as central to national economic security and development - such
  as the provision of energy. Private sector finance has been more readily involved
  in businesses and projects that provide a ready financial return over shorter
  timescales than would be required for government investment (Jacobson and Tarr,
  1995).<br>
  <br>
  The relationship between government and private finance has however changed
  considerably in recent years in many countries. Most relevant to climate change,
  this has been particularly clear in the energy sector. Faced with the rising
  costs and inadequate performance of state-funded energy developments, many governments
  around the world have privatised energy industries, are in the process of doing
  so, or are seeking to involve private finance even where energy systems remain
  primarily government owned (Dailami and Klein, 1998). For example, governments
  may set out terms of access to independent power generators. This has profound
  implications for financing the development and international transfer of clean
  energy technologies, and makes it all the more important to understand the operation
  of private finance and its relationship to the public sector in the funding
  of technology transfer (Blomstrom et al., 1995).</p>
