<h3>2.2.3 Foreign Lending </h3>
<p><i>Issues</i><br>
  Foreign loans for technology acquisition are provided by both governments (partly
  through multilateral lending institutions) and private sector financial institutions,
  with loan recipients falling into both categories as well<sup><small>
  <a href="fn4.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(4,1); return false;">1</a></small></sup>. 
  Loans come with an obligation to repay interest and principal. If loan principal
  and interest are not repaid on schedule the credit worthiness of the borrower
  can be downgraded, making access to new capital difficult. Unless hedged, loans
  also create foreign currency exposure, with its attendant risks (WBCSD, 1998).
  Historically, much of MDB lending has gone for large projects, including those
  in the energy sector or with some other link to climate change (more on MDB
  in <a href="099.htm">Section 5.2.4</a>).</p>

<p><i>Lending Trends</i><br>
  Lending by multilateral development banks to climate change relevant sectors
  has declined during the past decade. Loans for industrial development, for instance,
  decreased from US$8 billion in 1990 to US$4 billion in 1994 (UNIDO, 1997) due
  to the reduced emphasis on project lending by these banks and better access
  by developing countries to international capital markets. After a steep rise
  in the 1990s, the financial crisis in East and Southeast Asia brought about
  a sharp decrease in private external capital flows to most developing countries
  in that region. Net private foreign bank lending turned negative for the group
  of countries most affected by the crisis (ICC, 1998), and total global international
  bank lending to developing countries went from US$86 billion in 1996 to US$12
  billion in 1997 to negative US$65 billion in 1998 (OECD, 1999c). Lending from
  multilateral development banks, however, did not change significantly during
  the same period. Bond lending to the same countries, which had increased rapidly
  in the 1990s, fell as well, dropping from US$83 billion in 1997 to US$37 billion
  a year later (OECD, 1999c).</p>
<p>World Bank Group lending for energy investments is about one-fifth to one-sixth
  of the Group's total commitments, or an average of $3 billion per year during
  1995 to 1999 (World Bank, 1999). Over roughly the same period, World Bank lending
  for renewable energy (excluding large-scale hydropower and traditional geothermal)
  was $275 million in loans, credits and grants, or less than 10 per cent of the
  sector total. The trend, however, is more encouraging. During a period where
  lending for energy projects generally decreased, the Bank's commitments for
  energy efficiency and renewable energy increased. The number of projects that
  can be considered climate-friendly is projected to increase from 80 during the
  period 1996 to 1998 ($1.9 billion) to 160 during the period 1999 to 2001 ($2.3
  billion), as shown in <a href="023.htm#t22">Table 2.2</a> (World Bank, 1998b
  and 1999).</p>

<p>The World Bank Group's lending commitments in the renewable energy and energy
  efficiency areas have risen concomitantly with financing provided through the
  Global Environment Facility (GEF, 1998b) (see <a href="023.htm#b21">Box 2.1</a>
  and also <a href="099.htm">Section 5.2.4</a> and <a href="099.htm#b52">Box 5.2</a>).
  The financing trends provide strong evidence that GEF funds have not displaced
  or substituted for World Bank financing, but may instead have helped redirect
  it. New renewable and energy efficiency projects are still very few in number
  and to a large extent can be traced to programmes supported by donor governments
  in specific countries, mostly in South and East Asia. The need to bring these
  types of projects into the mainstream is recognised in the World Bank's new
  energy strategy. </p>
<p>Apart from the IBRD and regional development banks, other multilateral development-finance
  institutions lend for projects in areas related to climate change issues. The
  OPEC Fund for International Development, an example of a South-South lending-development-finance
  institution, has committed loans and grants totalling US$5.1 billion since it
  was founded in 1976 (OPEC, 1999). Almost 50 per cent of loans have gone for
  projects in the energy, industry, and transportation sectors. The Fund also
  provides grants to support technical assistance, research, and similar activities,
  and has a focus on the least developed and other low-income countries.</p>

      <p>Two multilateral funding mechanisms promote the transfer of technologies
	to developing countries in order to address global environmental problems:
	the Global Environment Facility and the Montreal Protocol Multilateral
	Fund<sup><small><a href="fn4.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(4,2); return false;">2</a></small></sup>
	(see also <a href="099.htm">Section 5.2.4</a> and <a href="099.htm#b52">Box 5.2</a> for GEF and
	<a href="039.htm">Section 3.3.3</a> for the Montreal Protocol).</p>
      <p>The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has since 1992 promoted technology
	transfer of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies to developing
	countries<sup><small><a href="fn4.htm#3" onClick="showFootnote(4,3); return false;">3</a></small></sup>
	. The early focus was on government-driven efforts, but the aim of current
	GEF programmes is to catalyse sustainable markets and enable the private
	sector to transfer technologies. An initial three-year pilot phase focused
	on cost-effectiveness of greenhouse-gas emissions reductions. Following
	the pilot phase, the GEF in 1996 adopted specific operational programmes
	for promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies by reducing
	barriers, implementation costs, and long-term technology costs (GEF 1996,
	1997). Additional programmes for energy-efficient transport and carbon
	sequestration are being developed.</p>
      <p>From 1991 to 1999 the GEF approved $700 million for 80 energy efficiency
	and renewable energy projects in 40 countries (GEF 1999). The total cost
	of these projects is $5.0 billion, as the GEF has leveraged financing
	through loans and other resources from governments, other donor agencies,
	the private sector, and the three GEF project-implementing agencies. An
	additional $200 million in grant financing has been provided for enabling
	activities and short term response measures; the total number of recipient
	countries is 120.</p>
      <p>GEF projects are testing and demonstrating a variety of financing and
	institutional models for promoting technology transfer (GEF, 1999 and
	GEF, 1998a). Fourteen projects diffuse photovoltaic technologies in rural
	areas through local community organisations, financial intermediaries,
	local photovoltaic dealers/entrepreneurs, and rural energy-service concessions.
	Several projects assist public and private project developers to install
	grid-based wind, biomass and geothermal technologies. For energy-efficiency
	technologies, projects promote technology diffusion through energy-service
	companies, utility-based demand-side management, private-sector sales
	of efficient lighting products, regulatory frameworks for municipal heating
	markets, and development and marketing of more efficient refrigerators
	and industrial boilers through foreign technology transfer.</p>
      <p>The Multilateral Fund helps developing countries eliminate their use
	of ozone-depleting substances. Since the Fund was established in 1991,
	over $775 million has been approved for 2,565 projects in developing countries
	that are Parties to the Protocol. Some 85 per cent of the total (over
	US$660 million) has been used for investment projects, in which ODS-based
	technologies have been replaced by more environmentally benign alternatives,
	or is directly related to investment project preparation (<a href="fig222.htm">Figure
	2.2</a>).</p>
      <p>The Fund has also supported a variety of non-investment projects, including
	the preparation of country programmes, demonstration projects involving
	ODS-alternative technologies or best practices to reduce ODS emissions,
	strengthening of national institutions, technical assistance, and training.
	Total funds approved for the 825 projects in the non-investment category
	have amounted to US$113 million since the Fund's inception.</p>
      <p>A UNEP survey of Implementing Agencies conducted in 1997 (UNEP, 1997)
	determined that of 863 investment projects approved through mid-1997,
	only 10 per cent had any sort of formal technology transfer agreement.
	Although all funded projects involved technology transfer in some form,
	much of the technology transferred was well established and in the public
	domain. Most projects did not require a private contractual agreement
	to proceed because they either involved unpatented technology or the patent
	had expired (Multilateral Fund Secretariat, 1998)</p>
