<h3>4.4.1 The growth of NGOs<sup><small><a href="fn6.htm#3" onClick="showFootnote(6,1); return false;">1</a></small></sup></h3>
<p>Three stages of development in southern community environmental movements have
  been identified (Doyle and McEachern, 1998). In the sixties' &quot;development&quot;
  decade the pervasive optimism meant that there was little movement opposition
  within the countries of the South. In the seventies, some key environmental
  movements emerged such as the Green Belt Movement in Kenya, the Environment
  Liaison Centre International, Environment and Development Action in the Third
  World, and Sahabat Alam Malaysia. These movements fought for &quot;people's&quot;
  development but did not oppose northern development ideology. More recently,
  a gap has opened between those groups that work with government and international
  agencies, and more radical environmental protest movements. These latter movements
  criticise northern science and technology, the industrial practices of MNCs,
  national and northern governments and international aid agencies (Doyle and
  McEachern, 1998). </p>
<p>There is now a vast range and number of NGOs. On one count there were 530 NGOs
  in 45 countries in the African Environmental Network; 6,000 NGOs in Latin America
  and the Caribbean; about 12,000 development NGOs in India; 10,000 NGOs in Bangladesh
  and 18,000 in the Philippines (Princen and Finger, 1994). </p>
<p>In the environmental sphere, NGOs have varying tools and techniques for influencing
  the processes of development. Where they operate within a corporatist approach,
  they negotiate and undertake advocacy work for change. Where there is accountability,
  political leverage can be brought to bear. For example, commercial groups whose
  policies impact adversely on the environment can be vulnerable to consumer boycotts
  organised by NGOs (Potter and Taylor, 1996). In some cases, particularly in
  Latin America, groups are working on problems such as urban air pollution and
  have conducted successful consumer focused campaigns (Oviedo and Bossano, 1996).
  There may also be direct confrontation and opposition which can lead to projects
  being abandoned (Hirsch and Lohman, 1989). And there can also be negotiation
  to reach a consensus after confrontation. However, despite their increased roles
  and visibility, non-specialised NGOs are commonly thought to suffer from four
  sets of weaknesses: limited technical capacity, limited scale, limited strategic
  capacity, and limited managerial capacity, so that capacity strengthening may
  be required (Chen, 1996).</p>
<p>Around the climate change issue, there is an increasing momentum for the development
  of organisations of &quot;business&quot; NGOs, that is groupings of businesses
  that support action in support of climate change and see commercial advantages
  in being there first. Two umbrella business groups have already started to develop
  networks. The Business Council for Sustainable Energy is working with partners
  in Latin America and Asia, while the Business Council for Sustainable Development
  is operating in Latin America (BCSD-LA) in <a href="057.htm#b42">Box 4.2</a>).</p>

    <td> <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Box 4.2 The Business Council for Sustainable
      Development - Latin America (BCSD-LA) (Source: September 1999- Monthly newsletter
      published by the BCSD-LA Eco-Efficiency Programme)</b></font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
    <td> The BCSD-LA has been operating for one year and has already compiled
      a book: &quot;Global Climate Change - Foundations for Business and Strategy
      and Practice in Latin America&quot;. It includes a Latin American position
      towards the climate change problem, with the support of 410 companies. The
      document has support from 15 country organisations within the BCSD-LA network.
      <br>
      <br>
      &quot;This book also presents a collection of case studies documenting strategies
      implemented by Latin American industry for minimising the effects of climate
      change. This is proof that the commitment taken on by the Latin American
      private sector in 1998 is already providing real, tangible results. With
      this the Latin American private sector is once again setting a new and important
      precedent in the world, by showing its leadership and response strategy
      to the tremendous challenge presented by climate change, without waiting
      for the FCCC to require it.&quot;</td>
