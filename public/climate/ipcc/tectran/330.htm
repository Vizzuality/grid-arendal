<h1> Case Study 2</h1>
<p> <b>Public Promotion of Private Investment in Efficient Lighting</b><br>

<p><b>Keywords</b>: CFLs; Green Lights; PELP</p>
<p><b>Summary</b><br>
  Governments and multilateral agencies have promoted efficient lighting markets
  as a means to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs). Lessons learned from the Poland
  Efficient Lighting Project (PELP) and Green Lights (GL) have inspired similar
  efforts in developing countries. </p>
<p><b>Background</b><br>
  In 1991, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), established Green
  Lights (GL) to encourage Partners to systematically consider efficient lighting
  investments. Furthermore, it empowers facilities managers to internally advocate
  for lighting efficiency upgrades.</p>
<p>PELP is a US$5 million initiative (1995 to 1998) funded by the Global Environment
  Facility (GEF) and executed by the IFC to reduce GHGs by increasing sales of
  compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). PELP reduces price and consumer awareness
  barriers through financial incentives and public education.</p>
<p><b>Approach</b><br>
  GL is a voluntary programme that encourages public and private institutions
  to enter into Memoranda of Understanding with U.S. EPA. Partners agree to invest
  in 90% of profitable lighting efficiency upgrades within five years. Partners
  appoint implementation managers and submit annual progress reports. GL also
  recruits utilities and lighting companies to become certified Allies. </p>
<p>U.S. EPA agrees to provide both Partners and Allies with efficient lighting
  technology workshops, objective information about efficient lighting technology
  and financing, and assistance publicising Partners' successes.</p>
<p>PELP selected a manufacturer wholesale price reduction approach because it
  promised the largest increase in CFL sales at the lowest cost. When the subsidy
  is given to the manufacturer, the sales tax and distribution chain markups are
  also proportionately reduced. Careful monitoring ensured that subsidies passed
  down the distribution chain to the retail level. Five Poland-based manufacturers
  competed to deliver the largest reduction in electricity use for the smallest
  subsidy (World Bank, 1996).<br>
  <br>
  The subsidy programme was accompanied by an extensive public education component
  using media, school programmes, environmental fairs and energy efficiency competitions.
  A PELP logo, along with the allowable retail price, was placed on subsidised
  products. </p>
<p>Through a competitive process, IFC selected the Netherlands Energy Company
  (NECO), a Dutch utility entity, to administer PELP. Among others, NECO drew
  upon services from the Polish Foundation for Energy Efficiency and the International
  Institute for Energy Conservation. The project also included a pilot CFL-based
  demand-side management (DSM) programme.</p>
<p><b>Impacts </b><br>
  GL has over 1,600 Partners (85% corporate, 15% government) and 594 Allies (41%
  manufacturers, 25% distributors, 21% lighting management companies, and 14%
  utilities). GL upgrades completed by 1997 reduced U.S. GHG emissions by 0.1%
  and U.S. EPA projects that this will rise to 0.4% by 2000. </p>
<p>GL does not provide direct subsidies to Partners; however, through 1997, the
  total administrative budget has been US$90 million and Partners received US$184
  million in utility DSM rebates. Through 1997, the private internal rate of return
  (IRR) for Partners averaged 50%. The social IRR (counting GL programme costs
  as expenses and excluding DSM transfers from benefits) is still robust at approximately
  35%. </p>
<p>In 1995, U.S. EPA launched the Energy Star Buildings programme that employs
  a similar voluntary approach to encourage efficiency in all aspects of building
  energy use. GL also inspired a related China Green Lights programme. While U.S.
  EPA supports international replication of the GL model, programmes must be carefully
  tailored to country-specific barriers. Moreover, multilaterals and NGOs may
  prove better positioned to propagate the lessons from this programme given political
  constraints on U.S. EPA investment in international programmes.</p>
<p>With PELP, US$2.6 million in GEF-funded direct subsidies leveraged US$7.5 million
  to reduce the cost of 1.2 million CFLs. Thus, US$2.10 of GEF wholesale subsidy
  per CFL yielded a US$5.90 retail price decrease, a 20% discount. These CFLs
  will save approximately 725 GWh of electricity and eliminate 206,000 tons of
  carbon. Public education activities raised consumer awareness of CFLs. Roughly
  50% of first-time CFL purchasers learned about CFLs through PELP and 80% said
  they intend to buy more CFLs. </p>
<p>PELP appears to have achieved the desired market transformation. Polish CFL
  prices have stabilised and even dropped after the programme ended. This can
  be attributed to the economies of scale possible in the now-expanded Polish
  CFL market. GEF recently approved a US$15 million Efficient Lighting Initiative
  to promote similar programmes in other transitional and developing countries.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  Principle lessons include: engaging the private sector through manufacturer
  subsidies or voluntary agreements can reduce barriers to efficient lighting
  markets; governments can also help transform energy efficient lighting markets
  by providing credible public information; evaluating programmes like PELP and
  GL poses analytic challenges; for PELP, the use of respected local companies
  and NGOs was key to navigating legal and economic obstacles, lowering project
  costs and promoting capacity for implementing similar projects in the future.
</p>
<p>The fundamental programme evaluation obstacle is determining what would have
  happened had the programme never existed. Free riders and drivers underlie this
  baseline problem. The free rider effect is the percentage of participants who
  would have purchased efficient lighting had GL or PELP never existed. The free
  driver effect refers to non-participants that invest in upgrades due to indirect
  effects such as spillover of information and price reductions. Duke and Kammen
  (1999) show that GL has decreased the price of electronic ballasts by approximately
  1-2%. This induces additional demand for efficient lighting products. </p>
