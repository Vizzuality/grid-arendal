<p> <b>The Commercial Dissemination of Photovoltaic Systems in Kenya</b><br>

<p><b>Summary</b><br>
  The commercial market for solar photovoltaic (PV) home systems has been active 
  in Kenya for over 10 years. Over 80,000 solar home systems (SHSs) have been 
  sold, providing power to over 1% of the rural population of roughly 25 million 
  people. The total installed capacity is over two megawatts (MWp), with typical 
  individual systems from 10 - 40 Wp (Wp = peak watts), and costs per system between 
  US$250 and US$1,000. By contrast, the national Rural Electrification Programme 
  has connected less than 2% of the rural households to grid-connected power supply. 
  The Kenyan PV market evolved without subsidies or significant government or 
  multinational agency support, although the activities of several private and 
  volunteer organisations helped to disseminate information on photovoltaics and 
  provide opportunities. Today dozens of companies are active in the PV industry 
  in east Africa, and annual sales may exceed 20,000 - 30,000 individual systems 
  and over 300 kWp (Msinga et al., 1997). USAID, GTZ, Care and Bellerive foundations 
  were instrumental in the development and dissemination process of cookstoves.</p>
<p><b>Background</b><br>
  Today nearly two billion people worldwide remain without electricity or the 
  immediate prospect of grid electrification. While over 1.2 billion people have 
  gained access to grid-connected electricity services over the past 20 years, 
  this has not kept pace with the population that has grown by over 1.5 billion 
  during the same time span. In Africa, grid extension has been the slowest of 
  all the major regions of the 'South'; only half of urban residents and a mere 
  eight per cent of the rural population are served by a grid-based power supply. 
  Meeting the growing demand for power over the next decades will be exceedingly 
  difficult in itself, and will be compounded by the challenge of doing so without 
  massive increases in GHG emissions.</p>
<p>Until the late 1980s PV electrification in east Africa was largely confined 
  to the affluent and to donor projects that often powered wells and bore holes, 
  schools, refrigerators in rural health clinics, and missions (Acker and Kammen, 
  1996). These systems generally arrived as complete packages, often imported 
  directly from overseas via a local agent, distributor, or development group. 
  Falling prices of crystalline and amorphous panels, increased awareness of the 
  services that photovoltiacs can provide, and recognition of the potential to 
  commercialise PV systems all increased activity in the local market. </p>
<p><b>Approach</b><br>
  A key aspect of the dissemination process for photovoltaics in Kenya is the 
  degree that it has been market driven, and thus the 'approach' taken is best 
  described as 'market realism'. Initially, most systems were relatively large, 
  and, as noted above, either donated or purchased by rural elites. A recent survey 
  of over 400 households (Msinga et al., 1997) found that while the mean income 
  was US$108/month, three-fourths of the system owners earned less than US$100/month, 
  which is close to the national average. Recently the average system size had 
  decreased from over 40 Wp to about 20 Wp, including the sales of large numbers 
  of 12-14 Wp packaged systems. </p>
<p>Expanding interest in SHSs in the late 1980s and early 1990s was accompanied 
  by a change in the retail network and the development of a diverse regional 
  network of assembly, sales, installation, and maintenance businesses. While 
  solar panels are still imported, local companies now manufacture batteries for 
  use in PV systems, and the 'balance-of-system' (electronics, charge controllers, 
  lights and outlets, and other components) is assembled or manufactured in Kenya. 
  Local agents now sell over half of all modules, and three-fourths of the PV 
  batteries. Sales of SHSs in Kenya have been increasing at 10 - 18% per year, 
  and this trend is expected to continue.</p>
<p><b>Impacts</b><br>
  PV systems have had a significant impact in Kenya and East Africa. Surveys indicate 
  that most of the systems (&gt; 60%) were performing well, with the majority 
  of the remaining systems not in use because the battery had no charge (Acker 
  and Kammen, 1996; Msinga et al., 1997). Most users purchased PV for the combined 
  services of lighting, TV, and radio, and were pleased with the systems and would 
  recommend them to others. In many locations the PV systems are simply cheaper 
  than the kerosene, diesel or other alternatives, and in virtually every case 
  the service provided by the SHS is superior in quality and reliability to these 
  alternatives.</p>
<p>The PV experience in Kenya has also proved to be an important model for SHS 
  introduction efforts in other developing nations (Cabraal et al., 1995), and 
  Kenya as well as a number of other nations are now the target for international 
  aid and development funding to expand the markets for rural PV in developing 
  nations. Kenya has also become the focus for a regional PV market that extends 
  into neighbouring nations, as well as to other regions of Africa.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  A variety of lessons emerge from the Kenya experience. First, a relatively small 
  set of organisations and individuals providing training and support services 
  can provide a critical infrastructure for an emerging technology. Second, subsidies 
  are not necessarily needed to promote technology transfer, although logistical 
  support, training courses, and performance standards all have central roles 
  that require policy attention and commitments of resources. Critical to the 
  sustainability of the PV industry has been the diversity of commercial interests. 
  The role for government and international policy action is also significant, 
  and includes setting policies that promote independent power producers, limit 
  or remove taxes and tariffs on desirable clean energy alternatives, and provide 
  credit or financing to both companies and end-users.</p>
