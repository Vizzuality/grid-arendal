<h3>10.4.2 Programmes and Policies for Technology Transfer</h3>
<p> 
  <i>Assessment</i><br>
  Assessment of the most efficient technology to abate GHG emissions while requiring
  the minimum amount of investment is an important aspect of the technology transfer
  mechanism.<br>
  <br>
  Traditionally government participation in the innovation process has occurred
  as a main promoter of R&amp;D and buyer of new technologies. It is important
  to note that government's role is also important in the area of information,
  regulation, and in the definition of market-based initiatives (see <a href="051.htm">Chapter
  4</a> on the role of enabling environments for technology transfer).<br>
  <br>
  Information and education programmes can be conceived as efforts for increasing
  public awareness regarding the availability of climate-friendly investments
  and also directed to reeducate experts who are trained in conventional technologies
  and procedures. Programmes directed to both of these purposes can be very effective.
  In Brazil hydroelectricity has been almost the only source of electricity generation
  for many decades, and most of the population were not aware of other alternatives
  which could bring many advantages (low initial cost, short implantation time,
  few social issues, etc.), as well as many difficulties (GHG emissions, electricity
  cost dependence on oil prices, etc.). Information and education programmes were
  mostly carried out with knowledge acquired abroad through non-financial technology
  transfer services (intelligence gathering and dissemination, technical assistance,
  independent validation and testing, and brokering activities performed by economic
  development agencies, and non-governmental organisations), and diffused later
  on through the same mechanism.<br>
  <br>
  The fact that some ESTs are in the public domain<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#5" onClick="showFootnote(11,5); return false;">5</a></small></sup>
  provides opportunities for the countries which want to develop them locally
  (Korea, 1998). Hence, the priority task is to maximise the diffusion of information
  on these technologies. Increasing the use of computers and all their presently
  available associated software for communication (the Internet) can provide a
  very good opportunity for most countries. Better education is seen as an opportunity
  for developing countries to have the required trained human resources for developing
  and utilising these technologies, as well as to absorb and take advantage of
  the ones available from IC by any possible transfer mechanism (Davidson et al.,
  1991). <br>
  Regulation, such as setting minimum efficiency requirements for the energy supply
  sector, could be important for inducing use of more efficient technology.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Agreement and Implementation</i><br>
  Once assessment of the technology is completed it is important to examine how
  the technology transfer can evolve to its next step, which is the agreement
  between parties and project implementation.<br>
  <br>
  Market availability is a very important condition for the success of a new technology
  (OTA, 1995a; Rothwell, 1974; Langrish et al., 1972). Market pull is important
  since private entrepreneurs with short-term interests will be resistant to investments
  in new technologies unless a market exists and uncertainties are low. Usually
  this market is initiated by pilot projects, government investments or acquisitions,
  importation of products and services from abroad (FCCC, 1998), or consumers
  willing to pay a premium price. As they gain acceptance rising public interest,
  private investors from the country or abroad will understand that a potential
  market is available, and through actions on maintenance services and on better
  prices it can be enlarged. The creation of a market has been a responsibility
  assumed quite often by the government through procurement of new technologies
  for public missions like energy production and distribution, and provision of
  incentives for its development, including grants, low interest loans, import
  duty exemption, income tax exemption, and competitively determined subsidies.
  Grants are a very common incentive used to stimulate adoption of a new technology
  in industrialised countries (e.g. The Clean Coal Program in US - see the Compendium
  on Clean Coal - <a target="_top" href="http://www.lanl.gov/projects/cctc/">http://www.lanl.gov/projects/cctc/</a>;
  The Salix Consortium - Biomass for Rural Development (<a target="_top" href="http://www.eren.doe.gov/biopower/newyork.html">http://www.eren.doe.gov/biopower/newyork.html</a>)
  and in developing countries (see <a href="200.htm#b101">Box 10-1</a>, and <a href="334.htm">Case Study
  6</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>). An example of the use of income tax
  exemption is discussed for The Netherlands (see below). Competitively determined
  subsidies have been employed in industrialised countries - the Non-Fossil-Fuel
  Obligation (NFFO) in the UK, and the electricity feed law (EFL) in Europe (Grubb
  and Vigotti, 1997; Brower et al., 1997; Mitchell, 1995).<br>

  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
    <td>India has a history of policy driven technology promotion for emerging
      technologies. Prior to the economic reforms initiated early this decade,
      the new and renewable energy technologies were promoted in the initial stages
      through the target-oriented-supply-push approach. Government agencies identified
      the investors as well as suppliers and fixed the technology price. Financial
      support was limited to target capacity without any price signal since market
      had no role.
      <p>Policies in the post-economic reform have allowed a greater role for
	the market. Project promoters accessed the financial incentives in addition
	to their own investments. The government provides tax concession through
	accelerated depreciation of capital equipment. Under the market dynamics,
	the technology transfer occurred via the market, as companies competed
	to provide the technology. The success of this pathway is evident in the
	rising deployment of wind power in India in past five years (Ramana and
	Shukla, 1998).</p>
    </td>

<p> <br>
  Market-based incentives set up by the government are useful approaches that
  are helping renewables to be commercialised in small niches. Three examples
  of this approach - the Government of India's effort to promote wind power technology
  (see <a href="200.htm#b101">Box 10.1</a>), fiscal support for renewables in the 
  Netherlands and the carbon tax in Norway (see below) are presented.</p>
<ul>
  <li> In the Netherlands the government actively supports renewable energy through
    various financial measures. Fiscal policies allow accelerated depreciation
    and investment cost allowances for companies investing in renewables. The
    generated income of private investors in so-called Green Funds are tax-exempt.
    In addition, the distributing utilities are allowed to retain the standard
    regulatory energy tax to support renewable energy producers and may also sell
    Green Electricity at a premium price to environmentally conscious customers.
    In a pilot market scheme for Green Certificates, a trading mechanism (spot
    and forward market) has been established for renewably generated electricity,
    which makes it feasible to efficiently reach quantified targets for renewable
    energy introduction. </li>
  <li> Natural gas industry investments in most of the industrialised countries
    are essentially done by the private sector. But the presence of the government
    is important to create an enabling environment for private-sector driven technology.
    CO<span class="subscript">2</span> extracted from natural gas wells and injected
    into a shallow acquifer (see <a href="190.htm">10.2.2</a>) has turned economically
    feasible in Norway due the existence of a carbon tax. The factors that make
    this development different from the already practical injection of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
    for improved oil recovery is the shallow depth and low injection pressure,
    the wet CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and the need for the system to
    dispose of available CO<span class="subscript">2</span> at any time. By publishing
    the results of this development, the technology is made available to anyone
    who wishes to sequester CO<span class="subscript">2</span> in an aquifer under
    similar geological and operating conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p> 
  A mix of policy instruments appears effective in many countries in promoting
  renewables. In Germany, for example, the success in promoting renewable energy
  in the last few years is attributed to a large extent to the Electricity Feed
  Law, which requires utilities to buy electricity from renewable sources at premium
  rate, and to direct subsidies for renewables, which amounted to DM 55 (approx.
  US$ 29<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#6" onClick="showFootnote(11,6); return false;">6</a></small></sup>)
  million in 1995/1996. The most remarkable aspect is the success of wind energy
  in Germany, whose capacity increased from 61 MW in 1990 to about 1,545 MW at
  the end of 1996. The process has been supplemented by an aggressive information
  campaign, which helps to disseminate information on current application and
  the most recent research available on renewable energy (IEA, 1997).<br>
  <br>
  Technology implementation is facilitated if it fits in with country capital-labour
  mix. Under this vision, the GHG abatement option of increasing the use of renewable
  energy is welcome, because of the large number of permanent jobs created. Considering
  this measure, biomass-based electricity combined with heat production is the
  most favourable option, followed by PV. Hydro and mini-hydro plants also create
  a large number of jobs; yet only during the construction period (Moreira and
  Poole, 1993). The Brazilian Alcohol Program has survived during the first half
  of the 1990s with arguments based strongly on the large number of permanent
  jobs created, and the synergism between the low qualification requirement of
  the cane harvester and the large number of low-literacy workers. This particular
  match was an important factor for the rapid diffusion of ethanol production
  in Brazil (Moreira and Goldemberg, 1999). A similar situation is occurring in
  the United States where the creation of numerous work opportunities for corn
  farmers are used as an important argument for the promotion of this liquid fuel
  (Evans, 1997).<br>
  <br>
  Another way to guarantee the implementation of technologies is the use of the
  legal structure. The Brazilian Alcohol Program was introduced in such way. A
  law was passed to strengthen the national sugar industry, thereby reducing hard
  currency expenditures on oil imports. Thus, the Program was motivated by potential
  economic benefits and not to meet GHG abatement targets. Another opportunity
  for energy technology transfer is the recognition by decision makers that availability
  of power, even in small amounts, provides a significant improvement in the quality
  of life (see <a href="331.htm">Case Study 3</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>).
  This is pushing the market for small PV units. International experience has
  shown a positive correlation between access to energy and electricity services
  and educational attainment and literacy among both the rural and urban poor.
  Families lacking adequate energy supplies will tend to limit children's time
  spent on schoolwork and reading; in extreme cases, families may withdraw children
  from the school systems to spend time on firewood and dung collection. Worldwide,
  female children are disproportionately affected.<br>
  <br>
  In stand-alone applications, remote from the electrical grid (for lighting,
  water pumping and refrigeration), PV has been competitive for several years
  (IPCC, 1996). In such applications, PV systems are often competitive with presently
  used kerosene, candles and dry-cell batteries (assuming that low cost money
  is available), but typically there is no infrastructures to provide people with
  access to this technology (see <a href="333.htm">Case Study 5</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter
  16</a>).<br>
  <br>
  <i>Evaluation &amp; Adjustment</i><br>
  Even considering that the energy industry is quite homogeneous throughout the
  world, several opportunities for evaluation and adjustment of technologies exist
  in particular countries or regions. The operation efficiency of the electricity
  generating equipment in developing countries - with some notable exceptions
  - is often substantially below that achieved in the industrialised countries,
  despite the fact that the basic technology is the same (Maya and Churie, 1996).
  Thermal efficiency and forced outage rate, which are important measures of maintenance
  efficiency, should improve (OTA, 1992). Over the past two decades, the cost
  effectiveness of generation system rehabilitation has become recognised in the
  United States and Europe, where a great deal of attention has been placed on
  what has become known as &quot;life extension&quot; or &quot;life optimisation&quot;
  (OTA, 1992). Efforts of this type require hard and soft technologies, since
  most of the technological barriers leading to such poor performance are credited
  to inadequate training.<br>
  <br>
  One of the adjustment processes is on-the-job training. Successful innovations
  require that entrepreneurs assemble a team of well trained scientists, engineers,
  technicians, managers and marketers who develop new technologies and incorporate
  them into products; manufacture them in a way that is timely, cost effective,
  and responsive to the market; and sell them. Training workers with these diverse
  skills is the responsibility of different institutions, both public and private
  (OTA, 1995a). In many universities, graduates often receive little training
  in manufacturing processes, product design and teamwork. Nevertheless, workplace
  education supplements formal education, as workers learn through experience
  and formal training programmes. For emerging technologies in particular, many
  of the skills needed for commercial success are not available in the formal
  education systems, but are developed instead by companies engaged in proprietary
  R&amp;D programmes (OTA, 1995). Labour force skills are expanded through industry
  conferences, technical committees, and trade publications and technical journals,
  which provide an opportunity for industry participants to exchange ideas and
  share knowledge.<br>
  <br>
  In the case of biomass technologies the issue of adjustment is magnified. Biomass
  yields are sensitive to climate and soil characteristics, and any successful
  project in one site has to be properly adapted to provide similar results in
  new sites<sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#7" onClick="showFootnote(11,7); return false;">7</a></small></sup>
  . This is exemplified in the discussion of a <a href="336.htm">Case Study 8</a>, <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Replication </i><br>
  Even in the developed world R&amp;D represent only a small fraction, 10 to 15%,
  of the resources required to bring to market a new product that incorporates
  substantially new technology. The other 85-90% is so-called downstream investment:
  design, manufacturing, applications engineering, and human resource development
  (OTA, 1995). Developing a highly qualified human infrastructure in the downstream
  investment sector, will facilitate in dealing with one of the two faces of technology
  development -- &quot;problems in search of solutions&quot; -- which is what
  industry, society, and design engineers encounter in practice. Even with poor
  investments in the second face of technology development -- &quot;solutions
  in search of problems&quot; -- a country can reach a high level of technological
  development (Greene and Hallberg, 1995).<br>
  <br>
  Assuming R&amp;D conducted at universities and research centres is sufficient,
  it is very important to establish linkages between networks of research laboratories
  and the private sector to facilitate the transfer of technologies to industry,
  and for the users of technology to channel their feedback to the generators
  of knowledge. In the USA, since the 1980s, Congress and the executive branch
  began to supplement this approach within a series of programmatic efforts aimed
  at helping specific industries. Some of these efforts encourage government and
  private industry to (OTA,1995a;DOE, 1999):</p>
<ol>
  <li> share the cost of strengthening the supplier base of some important industries</li>
  <li> share the cost of pre-competitive research projects, and,</li>
  <li> disseminate best-practices to manufacturing firms, many of which are unfamiliar
    with the most advanced manufacturing technologies and practices.</li>
</ol>
<p> <br>
  The US Government is committed to ensuring the full implementation of technology
  transfer policies and legislation in all federal agencies. For the DOE technology
  transfer is a priority mission at all levels of department management. The EPA
  and Department of Commerce also have made significant improvements in their
  technology transfer programmes (National Energy Strategy, 1991). This attention
  on technology transfer builds in a strong base of legislative and policy mandates.
  In recent years, the US Congress and the Administration have cooperated on legislation
  specifically directed towards increasing the transfer of federally developed
  technology to US entities (National Energy Strategy, 1991). States have also
  funded RD&amp;D. California funds certain public interest RD&amp;D projects
  to &quot;advance science or technology not adequately provided by competitive
  or regulated markets&quot;. A surcharge on electric rates is the source of funds.
  Focus areas include renewables, efficiency, advanced power generation, power
  system reliability, and environmental research (Tanton, 1998; <a target="_top" href="http://www.energy.ca.gov">http://www.energy.ca.gov</a>).
  <br>
  <br>
  Clusters of research-production-marketing activities, such as applied research
  parks or university-industry parks will facilitate the connection of research
  to production and the marketing of the results. Rather than dispersing assets,
  the parks offer a synergistic concentration of knowledge, workers, and facilities
  (Greene and Hallberg, 1995).<br>
  <br>
  Although there is a consensus among economists that over the long-run innovation
  is the single most important source of long-term economic growth, and that returns
  on investment in research and development are several time as high as the returns
  on other forms of investment, private firms generally tend to underinvest in
  research and development (Cohen and Nell, 1991). Overall, government support
  for energy research and development in International Energy Agency member countries
  fell by 1/3 in absolute terms and by half a percentage of GDP in the decade
  ending in 1992 (see <a href="094.htm#t51">Table 5.1</a>; Reddy et al., 1997).
  Not only has overall energy research and development spending been declining,
  but also only a modest fraction of R&amp;D spending has been committed to the
  sustainable energy technologies.</p>
