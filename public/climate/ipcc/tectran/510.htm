<h1>1.5 Barriers to the transfer of Environmentally Sound Technologies </h1>
<p>The spread of proven ESTs that would diffuse through commercial transactions 
  may be limited because of existing barriers. Barriers to the transfer of ESTs 
  arise at each stage of the process. Thesevary according to the specific context, 
  for example from sector to sector and can manifest themselves differently in 
  developed countries, developing countries and countries with economies in transition. 
  . The Report provides an extensive overview of the most important barriers in 
  developed, developing and transition economies that could impede the transfer 
  of ESTs to mitigate and adapt to climate change (see <a href="510.htm#tts3">Table 
  TS 3</a> and <a href="510.htm#tts4">TS 4</a> for further reference). Governments 
  can promote technology transfer by reducing the barriers that are associated 
  with each of these elements of an enabling environment.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Lack of full-cost pricing, which internalises environmental and social
    costs;</li>
  <li> Poor macroeconomic conditions, which could include underdeveloped financial
    sector, high import duties, high or uncertain inflation or interest rates,
    uncertain stability of tax and tariff policies, investment risk;</li>
  <li> Low private sector involvement because of lack of access to capital, in
    particular inadequate financial strength of smaller firms;</li>
  <li> Lack of financial institutions or systems to ensure initial investments
    for the utilisation and extended use of transferred technologies;</li>
  <li> Low, often subsidised conventional energy prices resulting in negative
    incentives to adopt energy saving measures and renewable energy technologies;</li>
  <li> Lack of markets for ESTs because of lack of confidence in economic, commercial
    or technical viability, lack of manufacturers, lack of consumer awareness
    and acceptance of technologies;</li>
  <li> Lack of supporting legal institutions and frameworks, including codes and
    standards for the evaluation and implementation of environmentally sound technologies;
  </li>
  <li> Lack of understanding of the role of developed and developing countries
    and international institutions in the failures and successes of past technology
    cooperation.;</li>
  <li> General lack of support for an open and transparent international banking
    and trading system;</li>
  <li> Institutional corruption in both developed and developing countries;</li>
  <li> Reluctance to identify and make available ESTs that are in the public domain;
  </li>
  <li> Insufficient human and institutional capabilities;</li>
  <li> Inadequate vision about and understanding of local needs and demands;</li>
  <li> Inability to assess, select, import, develop and adapt appropriate technologies;</li>
  <li> Lack of data, information, knowledge and awareness, especially on &quot;emerging&quot;
    technologies; </li>
  <li> Lack of confidence in unproven technologies;</li>
  <li> Risk aversion and business practices that favour large projects in financial
    institutions including MDBs; </li>
  <li> Lack of science, engineering and technical knowledge available to private
    industry;</li>
  <li> Insufficient R&amp;D because of lack of investments in R&amp;D and inadequate
    science and educational infrastructure;</li>
  <li> Inadequate resources for project implementation;</li>
  <li> High transaction costs;</li>
  <li> Lack of access to relevant and credible information on potential partners
    to allow for the timely formation of effective relationships which could enhance
    the spread of ESTs.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no pre-set answer to enhancing technology transfer. The identification,
  analysis and prioritisation of barriers should be country based. It is important
  to tailor action to the specific barriers, interests and influences of different
  stakeholders in order to develop effective policy tools. </p>
