<h3>5.5.7 The Case of the Montreal Protocol</h3>
<p> The possibilities for partnerships and financing for climate change mitigation
  can be better understood through an examination of the historical experience
  in phasing out ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) under the Montreal Protocol
  on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (see also <a href="039.htm">Section
  3.3.3</a> in <a href="033.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Evaluations of the economics
  of the phaseout process that have been made since the Protocol was signed in
  1987 have concluded that the speed of the phaseout has been faster, and the
  cost lower, than had been anticipated when the Protocol was negotiated (Hammitt,
  1997; Cook, 1996; Economic Options Committee, 1991, 1994, 1998). This happy
  surprise is attributable largely to the unusual and unexpected channels for
  technology transfer that emerged once the Protocol was in place.<br>
  <br>
  The signing of the Montreal Protocol meant that significant cutbacks in ozone-depleting
  substances had become a strategic business necessity. Industrial leaders' recognition
  of this fact may in part have been simply an acknowledgement of the legal reality
  of the Protocol, but there is ample reason to believe that their support of
  the Protocol was based on an understanding of the science as well. Given the
  existence of this sort of consensus, undertaking the kind of organisational
  changes needed to eliminate ODSs followed. Participation in the ozone protection
  effort became a basis for career advancement and a source of personal pride
  for individuals within companies. Firms found that by redesigning processes
  to reduce their need for ODSs, they could realise previously unforeseen productivity
  gains, as when it was discovered that printed circuit boards could be manufactured
  without having to clean off soldering residues with a CFC solvent (Iman and
  Lichtenberg, 1993; Wexler, 1996a). <br>
  <br>
  A variety of cooperative arrangements evolved under the umbrella of the Montreal
  Protocol that facilitated technology transfer. Soon after the Protocol was signed,
  a number of large corporations with major electronics interests formed ICOLP,
  the Industry Cooperative for Ozone Layer Protection, to share information, discoveries,
  and procedures for eliminating ODSs in their manufacturing processes. A similar
  consortium was founded in Japan, the JICOP (Japan Industrial Conference for
  Ozone Layer Protection). Company-to-company deals, multifaceted agreements involving
  both companies and governments, and both formal and informal information exchanges
  characterised the process. Examples include the trilateral agreement between
  Thailand, Japan MITI, and the U.S. EPA (see Case <a href="351.htm">Study 23</a>)
  and the cooperation between the Government of Mexico, Camara Nacional de la
  Industria de la Transformacion, the Canadian telecommunication company Nortel
  (Northern Telecom), the International Cooperative for Ozone Layer Protection,
  and the U.S. EPA. (Economic Options Committee 1994; also see <a href="345.htm">Case
  Study 17</a>)). <br>
  <br>
  Governments played a supportive role in the formation of information-exchange
  networks. In the United States, for example, a vital clearinghouse role was
  filled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Stratospheric Ozone Protection
  Division. The U.S. EPA, along with the industry-based Alliance for Responsible
  Atmospheric Policy (formerly the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy), Environment
  Canada, and the United Nations Environment Programme, co-sponsored an annual
  meeting in which industry practitioners presented papers detailing the progress
  they had made in eliminating ODSs in their own operations. The culture of this
  well-attended meeting was akin to a scientific symposium or a scholarly conference,
  with an emphasis on free exchange of ideas. Part of the conference space was
  devoted to a trade fair, in which the most recent advances in technology to
  replace ODSs were on display. By 1998 the conference had evolved into the &quot;Earth
  Technologies Forum&quot; covering climate protection technologies as well as
  ODS elimination. <br>
  <br>
  The Multilateral Fund, set up under the Montreal Protocol to assist developing
  countries in defraying the &quot;incremental costs&quot; of compliance with
  the Montreal Protocol, also played an important role. The Fund has financed
  projects ranging from the development of individual country ODS-elimination
  programmes to the building of large-scale industrial facilities that use alternate
  technologies. In some respects, the Fund may be seen as a precursor and proving
  ground for the functioning and organisation of the Global Environmental Facility
  (see <a href="099.htm#b52">Box 5.2</a> on the GEF). It has been the objective
  of this Multilateral Fund to provide development assistance that is &quot;additional&quot;
  to other aid funds. Through establishment of the Multilateral Fund, the Parties
  to the Montreal Protocol have addressed the equity concerns that for a time
  retarded full participation in the ozone protection process by all the key countries
  (neither China nor India signed the Montreal Protocol until the Multilateral
  Fund was established at the London meeting of the Parties in 1990).<br>
  <br>
  Government policies were able to exert a positive influence on technology development
  in other ways. A major stumbling block to the elimination of ODSs in electronics
  manufacture was removed when the U.S. Department of Defense changed its requirement
  that CFC-113 be used to clean soldered electronic assemblies to a performance
  standard (Wexler, 1996b). Governments have helped to develop standards for recycling
  CFCs, and have supported the establishment of Halon &quot;banks&quot; to get
  full use from the stock of ODSs that have already been produced (Economic Options
  Committee, 1994). The United States imposed both an excise tax on 'new' ODSs
  and a 'floor tax' on inventories beginning in 1990. The effect of such taxes
  is to make new chemicals and technologies more attractive, and to encourage
  reclamation and recycling (Economic Options Committee, 1994). The Ninth Meeting
  of the Parties in Montreal, 1997, decided to require Parties to the Protocol
  to establish licensing systems to control the import and export of new, used,
  recycled and reclaimed substances, in order to reduce and eventually eliminate
  illegal trade in controlled ODSs (Economic Options Committee, 1998). </p>
