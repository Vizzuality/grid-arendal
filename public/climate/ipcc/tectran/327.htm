<h1>16.5 Key Findings and Lessons from Technology Cooperation</h1>
<p>Just as policies and policy instruments have varying effects on the marketability
  of a technology, they also tend to affect different aspects of the use and operation
  of the new technology. The salient lessons emerging from cases listed in this
  chapter include the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Technology cooperation can work remarkably well. The global economy has
    emerged with advanced communication and information access, experts trained
    internationally, and strong incentives for cooperation. Cooperation is particularly
    powerful in helping entrepreneurs choose new investments. At the local level,
    programmes spur local innovation and competition, when supported by broader
    cooperative networks that pool resources.</li>
  <li> Technology cooperation for global environmental protection has proved to
    be successful in a large number of cases. There is a global concern for environmental
    protection that is shared by citizens, corporations, and governments in every
    country. This concern has motivated unprecedented actions including global
    environmental treaties and accords (e.g. the Kyoto and Montreal Protocols,
    the Law of the Sea, and regional standard-setting measures for emissions such
    as SO<span class="subscript">2</span> over Europe).</li>
  <li> Technology cooperation can be win-win. In addition to being environmentally
    beneficial, technology cooperation can have additional benefits for participants.
    Companies gain reputation and access to national technology leaders and markets;
    engineers are challenged, motivated, and empowered; suppliers find capable
    customers to help introduce new technology; and end-users save money and improve
    their quality of life. The financial savings from efficient technologies,
    reduction of waste, and improved worker productivity often are greater than
    the costs of cooperative implementation. Nevertheless, win-win scenarios can
    be complex and multifaceted. In some cases nations or industries can be coerced
    or induced to adopt ESTs even if they do not initially perceive the benefits.
    An example is cogeneration of power in India where governmental regulation
    forced a change that, despite significant industry objections, has proved
    to have benefits to both the state through added power resources, and to the
    companies through additional sales and energy security.</li>
  <li> Funding is critical to technology cooperation. At a minimum, adequate funding
    is necessary for organising and managing projects, providing expert consultants,
    communication, and reporting. In some of the most successful examples of technology
    cooperation, funds are also available for the incremental costs of the environmentally
    superior technology (e.g. Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund, see <a href="039.htm">Section
    3.3.3</a> in <a href="033.htm">Chapter 3</a> and <a href="115.htm">5.5.7</a>
    in <a href="092.htm">Chapter 5</a>).</li>
  <li> Technology cooperation requires clear goals and motivation as a precondition
    for success. </li>
  <li> Corporate and government leadership accelerates progress by creating momentum,
    jointly overcoming market barriers and by promoting market incentives. Corporations
    are particularly influential in encouraging suppliers to improve environmental
    performance. Governments are often successful in streamlining regulatory approvals.
  </li>
  <li> Funding institutions as opposed to projects supports institutional capacity
    and local sustainability. Numerous cases point to an inability on the part
    of technology recipients to pursue locally appropriate technological solutions
    (e.g. dispersed renewable energy systems), because international support was
    only available for technology and not human and institutional resources and
    capacity.</li>
  <li> Failure to seek participation from users or local people in technological
    adaptations can lead to sub-optimal utilisation or even a complete failure
    in the use of the technology.</li>
  <li> Almost every successful technology cooperation results from the commitment
    of individual &quot;champions&quot; who motivate, persuade, and manage the
    technological, political and economic process that leads to eventual dissemination
    or commercialisation.</li>
  <li> Failure to recognise issues of intellectual property rights and proprietary
    R&amp;D produce significant bottlenecks to greater private-sector involvement
    in many technology transfer efforts that are environmentally and socially
    beneficial.</li>
  <li> Restructuring of markets for energy, recycled and re-used materials, and
    property rights for natural resources create opportunities for EST adoption.
    However, structural changes also create major challenges that require institutional
    solutions to make ESTs competitive or less costly than more resource-intensive
    technologies.</li>
  <li> National and international action and, in many cases, cooperation and policy
    initiatives are needed to attach appropriate prices to natural resources.
    If instituted, many of these policies could significantly reduce the wasteful
    use and pollution of limited global resources.</li>
