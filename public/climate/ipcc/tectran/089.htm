<h3>4.12.3 RTD and the innovation process</h3>
<p> The private sector in developed countries invests substantial sums in RTD,
  and this figure is growing in developing countries as well. Thus, an understanding
  of firms' decisions to invest in RTD and the process through which decisions
  about new technologies are made are crucial given the importance of new technologies
  to improving productivity of labour and capital in organisations (Bolwijn and
  Kumpe, 1990).<br>
  <br>
  The majority of traditional RTD innovation policies have been directed at closing
  the &quot;resource&quot; gap of firms -- that is, their available skills, investment
  capital, and science and technology base. But research has suggested that innovation
  fails at the level of capability -- the ability to focus specific sets of resources
  in a particular way (<i>e.g.,</i> financial management, marketing, understanding
  user needs, <i>etc.</i>) -- rather than because of inadequate resources. <br>
  <br>
  The available literature available on the subject indicates that the degree
  of competitiveness of the industry the firm is in, and the extent to which a
  particular technology would enhance their competitive position or advantage
  determines the choice of technology the firm decides to produce (Baum, 1995).
  Georghiou (1998) argues along similar lines by suggesting that this process
  of technology choice by producers emphasises sources of competitive differentiation
  explicitly, and tries to organise efficient communication circles including
  all stakeholders who provide complementary knowledge. Early users of emerging
  technologies are identified. Reliable signals for value engineering and for
  technology evaluation and selection are transmitted back to the R&amp;D community.
  Technology producers obviously require good R&amp;D departments with the requisite
  expert staff. This is also determined by the relationship between public sector
  research institutions and innovating firms. Baum further suggests that choice
  of technology to produce be based on the enterprise model of user needs.<br>
  Such a model involves taking complete inventory of technology and the evaluation
  of technologies according to what best fits the current system of the firm.
  This is closely related to the changes in the way firms manage and organise
  R&amp;D (Tschirky, 1994; Gerybadze, 1994). The current approach to R&amp;D management
  plays a crucial role in the choice of technology. Gerybadze (1994) suggests
  three areas where R&amp;D management plays such a crucial role, namely: <i>(i)</i>
  formulation and implementation of R&amp;D strategy are considered as integral
  and vital elements of corporate strategy; <i>(ii)</i> balancing basic research
  and generic technologies with applied developments and with the needs of different
  business units; and <i>(iii)</i> implementation of a corporate-wide process
  of information exchange, strategy formulation and implementation.<br>
  <br>
  The process of choice of technology by the user or recipient, on the other hand,
  depends to a large extent on the category of the recipient. Technology receiver/recipient
  may be a private company, a state-owned enterprise or local personnel in developing
  countries and will also include foreign affiliate (wholly or majority owned
  or joint venture) as well as supplier, customer and competitor enterprises.
  For foreign affiliates, technology choice is made through a parent organisation
  structure through its R&amp;D or technology acquisition process, all with the
  explicit aim of improving its competitive position in foreign markets (Young
  and Lan, 1997). The experiences of Asian New Industrialising countries (NIC)
  showed the importance of accessing technology from abroad and utilising indigenous
  capacities to exploit the benefits of foreign technologies (Tolentino, 1993).
  State-owned enterprises normally go through a government-centralised bureaucracy
  to acquire technology. The choice is often made through a competitive bidding
  process. The local private sector, on the other hand, relies more on information
  about different technologies, and also with due recognition of the firm's organisational
  capacity to absorb and utilise the technology in question; an ability to determine
  the content of the technology in question is necessary to complement the existing
  capability of the recipient organisation (Lado and Vozikis, 1996).<br>
  From developing countries' standpoint, the willingness to obtain foreign technology
  also depends on the motives of the local firm or partner (in the case of partnership
  or joint venture), receiver's capabilities and ability to select from available
  technologies, market imported technologies and introduce a degree of novelty
  in products or processes (Young and Lan, 1997). The assimilation and adoption
  of outside technologies heavily depend on the development of in-house technological
  capabilities (Young and Lan, 1997; Lado and Vozikis, 1996). The role of government
  is critical to ensure sound management of the macro-economy, and also implementing
  policies on technology, trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), education and
  training and infrastructure development, and, finally, providing an enabling
  environment for technology acquisition to thrive (Dunning, 1992). The literature
  in technology transfer finds significant evidence of complementarity between
  imports of foreign technology and domestic R&amp;D. Most R&amp;D by developing
  countries' firms are adaptive in nature, i.e., it adapts the foreign technology
  to the local conditions.<br>
  <br>
  Governments have been investing for three decades in RTD for environmentally
  sound energy technologies in the energy sector, often working with the private
  sector. There may be a case for seeing whether results from these processes
  have been used and disseminated sufficiently. Developing countries' RTD efforts
  are often adaptive, following externally developed technology, suggesting the
  need for additional resources to develop indigenous innovative capacity. RTD
  and the process of innovation are closely linked, but innovation has been found
  to fail at the level of capability-the ability to focus specific sets of resources
  in a particular way (<i>e.g.,</i> financial management, marketing, understanding
  user needs, <i>etc.</i>)-rather than because of inadequate resources or hardware.
  The process of dissemination depends closely on influencing key opinion formers
  at government departmental level, industry level, firm level or community level.
