<h1>Executive Summary </h1>
<p>The 1990s have seen broad changes in the types and magnitudes of the international
  financial flows that drive technology transfer, at least that occurring between
  countries. Official Development Assistance (ODA) from donor governments has
  become relatively less important to many developing countries given the dramatic
  increase in opportunities for obtaining private sector financing for technology
  acquisition. The same is true of Official Assistance provided to Countries with
  Economies in Transition (CEITs). Levels of foreign direct investment, commercial
  lending, and equity investment all increased dramatically during the 1990s,
  to the point where ODA became less than one quarter of the total foreign finance
  available to developing countries by mid-decade. During this time many developing
  countries instituted policy changes that made them more attractive to private
  investors, often with the assistance of bilateral and multilateral donors; many
  governments now see their main role in the transfer of technology as facilitating
  the role of the private sector.<br>
  However, the general increase in the importance of private sector investment
  in developing countries masks two points. First, private sector investment has
  been very selective. While almost all countries have benefited to some degree,
  a handful of countries have received most of the attention. ODA is still critical
  for the poorest countries, particularly when it is aimed at developing capacities
  to acquire, adapt, and use foreign technologies. Second, private investment,
  most notably foreign portfolio equity investment and commercial lending, is
  often fickle. Many developing countries have found to their distress that private
  investment can quickly dry up if investors perceive more attractive--or less
  risky--opportunities elsewhere.</p>
<p>A notable characteristic of technology transfer is the difficulty with which
  it is actually measured and little is actually known about how much climate-relevant
  technology is successfully transferred each year. It is reasonable to assume
  that there exists a relationship between international financial flows and international
  technology transfer, but the results of existing efforts of data collection
  and statistical interpretation do not make this relationship clear. Greater
  attention paid to quantifying types of technology transferred and interpretation
  of trends would give governments better information on which to base policies.</p>
