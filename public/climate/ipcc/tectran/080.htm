<h3> 4.10.1 Equity and the Technology Transfer issue</h3>
<p>The selection of technology for the purposes of transfer may have a serious 
  impact on distribution issues: <br>
  <br>
  <i>Allocation of Emission entitlements</i><br>
  The climate change issue can be explained as the issue of how the rights to 
  use and pollute resources will be shared among countries and people. The allocation 
  of emission entitlements/targets is thus a crucial issue and will have an impact 
  on technology choices. The initial distribution of rights both nationally and 
  internationally may be a major bottleneck to the technology transfer process. 
  Theoretically, a 'fair' allocation of emission allowances to all countries would 
  allow the 'underusers' of such allowances to sell their allowances to 'overusers' 
  of such allowances. Such an instrument would thus provide an incentive to 'overusers' 
  to reduce their emission levels and help to redistribute resources to 'underusers' 
  who generally would be the poorer countries. By allowing the market to function, 
  the cheapest way of reducing the necessary global reductions in emissions can 
  be achieved (UNCTAD, 1995; Agarwal and Narain, 1992). However, the critical 
  issue is how should the initial allocations of emission allowances be undertaken? 
  The recent literature indicates a proliferation of articles that discuss the 
  definition of equity. These include allocation based rules which include, in 
  addition to per capita principles, the principles of equal rights to pollute, 
  the polluter pays principle, the basic needs approach, outcome-based rules such 
  as equal abatement costs, equal percentage net GDP loss, compensation to net 
  losers, etc. (Banuri et al., 1996; Metz, 1999). Both legal precedent and the 
  scientific literature do not point towards an optimum approach. Whatever agreements 
  are made on modalities at the international level and on the decisions about 
  approaches, these are likely to affect the outcomes of technology transfer within 
  countries. The way the allocations of emission allowances are distributed would 
  help to determine the potential for financing technology cooperation between 
  countries (in terms of demand for CDM and JI, for example).<br>
  <i><br>
  Adaptation versus mitigation</i><br>
  The climate change issue can be addressed through emission limitation measures 
  and adaptation measures. Since available funds are limited, the issue of prioritising 
  technology becomes central. Adaptation technologies tend to help local people 
  adapt and may be seen as a local impact, and, until now the emphasis has been 
  on limitation technologies which are seen as contributing to the solution to 
  the global problem of climate change. Bodansky (1993) explains &quot;adaptation 
  measures generate primarily local benefits, so that developed countries have 
  little incentive to fund adaptation measures&quot;. Until recently (see <a href="063.htm">section 
  4.5</a>), little attention had been given to activating the CoP1 decisions on 
  adaptation and has adaptation played only a marginal part in the reports produced 
  by IPCC. This reflects the limited attention given to adaptation by scientists 
  as well as policy-makers worldwide. In his elaborate review of the Working Group 
  II volume of the IPCC Second Assessment Report, Kates (1997) suggested the reason 
  for this lies in the existence of two distinct schools of thought about climate 
  change, both of which have chosen not to encourage adaptation research and planning.<br>
  <br>
  The &quot;preventionist&quot; school argues that the ongoing increase of atmospheric 
  greenhouse-gas concentrations could be catastrophic, and that drastic action 
  is required to reduce emissions. Preventionists fear that increased emphasis 
  on adaptation will weaken society's willingness to reduce emissions and thus 
  delay or diminish mitigation efforts. The &quot;adaptationist&quot; school, 
  on the other hand, sees no need to focus on neither adaptation nor mitigation. 
  They argue that both natural and human systems have a long history of adapting 
  naturally to changing circumstances and that active adaptation will bring with 
  it high social costs (Kates, 1997).<br>
  <br>
  The increasing awareness of climate change not as a theoretical phenomenon but 
  as a genuine threat has led to the emergence of a third school of thought, which 
  Klein and MacIver (in press) have labelled the &quot;realist&quot; school. The 
  realist school regards climate change as a fact, but acknowledges that impacts 
  are still uncertain. Further, realists appreciate that the planning and implementation 
  of effective adaptation options takes time. Therefore, they understand that 
  a process must be set in motion to consider adaptation as a crucial and realistic 
  response option along with mitigation (<i>e.g.,</i> Parry <i>et al.,</i> 1998; 
  Pielke, 1998).<br>
  <br>
  The least developing countries, and particularly the small island states, are 
  putting increased emphasis on this side of the issue. Vulnerability indices 
  are being developed, for example, by SPREP and UNEP. Adaptation technologies 
  which involve institutional infrastructures (for example in agriculture, health 
  and human settlement planning) could be integrated with other parts of efforts 
  to alleviate poverty and promote development, but it is not yet clear if there 
  is much joined-up thinking in evidence at the donor level.</p>
