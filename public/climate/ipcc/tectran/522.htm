<h1>3. Technology Transfer: A Sectoral Analysis</h1>
<p>Domestic actions, and those taken in co-operation with other countries, will
  require an increased penetration of environmentally sound technologies, many
  of which are particularly important in their application to each sector. What
  is the potential for the penetration of mitigation and adaptation technologies?
  What barriers exist to the increased penetration of such technologies? Can these
  be overcome through the implementation of a mix of judicious policies, programmes
  and other measures? What can we learn from past experience in promoting these,
  or similar, technologies? Is it better to intervene at the R&amp;D stage or
  during the end-use of fuels and technology? The chapters in this section address
  these questions using examples specific to each sector. Technology transfer
  activities may be evaluated at three levels - macro or national, sector-specific
  and project-specific. Many of the options explored are at the latter two levels.
</p>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions from some sectors described are larger than those 
  from other sectors, and the importance of each greenhouse gas varies across 
  sectors and countries as well. Methane, for instance, is a much bigger contributor 
  to emissions from agricultural activity than, for instance, from the industry 
  sector. <a href="522.htm#tts5">Table TS5</a> shows the carbon emissions from 
  energy use in 1995. Emissions from electricity generation are allocated to the 
  respective consuming sector. Carbon emissions from the industrial sector clearly 
  constitute the largest share, while those derived from agricultural energy use 
  have the smallest share. In terms of growth rates of carbon emissions, however, 
  the fastest growing sector is transport and buildings. With rapid urbanisation 
  promoting increased use of fossil fuels for habitation and mobility, the two 
  sectors are likely to continue to grow faster than others in the future. Carbon 
  emissions from fossil fuels used to generate electricity amounted to 1,762 Mt 
  C of the total for all sectors in <a href="522.htm#tts5">Table TS5</a>. </p>

  <p align="left"><br>
    Technology transfer includes steps within and across countries by actors who
    are engaged in promoting the use of a particular technology along one or more
    pathways. The market penetration of a technology proceeds from research, development,
    and demonstration (RD&amp;D) to adoption, adaptation, replication and development.
    At a project-specific level, the elements of the pathway are different, and
    may proceed from project formulation, feasibility studies, loan appraisals,
    implementation, monitoring and evaluation and verification of carbon benefits.
  </p>
</div>
<p>The pathways that differ from sector to sector usually include many actors,
  starting with laboratories for RD&amp;D, manufacturers, financiers and project
  developers, and eventually the customer whose production capacity or welfare
  is hopefully enhanced through their use. This presumption needs to be carefully
  established through an assessment of technology needs of the customer. A poor
  needs assessment can result in ineffective technology transfer that could have
  been avoided had the assessment fully captured the social, and other attributes
  of the technology. The actors may make specific types of arrangements - joint
  ventures, public-private parnerships, licensing, etc., that are mutually beneficial.
  These arrangements will define the particular pathway chosen for technology
  transfer. </p>
<p>The spread of a technology may occur through transfer within a country and
  then transfer to other countries, both may occur simultaneously, or transfer
  across countries may precede that within a country. Generally, the spread of
  a technology is more likely to proceed along the first option rather than the
  other two, since the transfer of technologies to markets within a country is
  likely to be less expensive given the proximity to the market, and lower barriers
  to the penetration of that technology in the indigenous markets. Transfer of
  technology from one country to another will generally face trade and other barriers
  both in the initiating and recipient country, which may dissuade manufacturers
  and suppliers from implementing such transfer.</p>
<p>Many market barriers prevent the adoption of cost-effective mitigation options 
  in developing countries. Market barriers can be divided in more common barriers 
  which are more or less relevant for all sectors (see the above section on &quot;Barriers 
  to the transfer of ESTs and <a href="510.htm#tts3">Table TS3</a> and <a href="510.htm#tts4">TS4</a>) 
  and barriers specific for each sector. For example, the presence of subsidies 
  for electricity and fuels are highly relevant for ESTs in the energy sector, 
  but also affects the transfers of ESTs in the transport sector (through subsidised 
  fuel costs), the building and industry sector (the viability of energy efficient 
  technologies), waste sector (electricity generation from waste) and even in 
  agriculture and forestry (it affects the demand for biomass fuels such as agricultural 
  waste and wood). On the other hand, barriers like the risks of drought, fire 
  and pests are very sector-specific and mostly affect the forestry and agriculture 
  sectors.</p>
<p>What conditions and policies are necessary to overcome these barriers and successfully
  put in place technologies for mitigation and adaptation? There is no pre-set
  answer to enhancing technology transfer. The combination of barriers and actors
  in each country creates a unique set of conditions, requiring &quot;custom&quot;
  implementation strategies. Each of the sector specific chapters discusses the
  barriers that are particularly important to a sector, such as fuel and electricity
  price subsidies, weak institutional and legal frameworks, lack of trained personnel,
  etc. Each chapter also provides examples and case studies to highlight the barriers,
  and policies, programmes and measures that were used, or could be developed,
  to overcome them.</p>
<p><i>Adaptation technologies</i><br>
  The general dynamics of technology transfer apply to the transfer of climate
  mitigation and adaptation technologies. Nevertheless, it is important to note
  the special characteristics of adaptation technologies that distinguish them
  from mitigation technologies.</p>
<p>Many impacts of climate change will impinge on collective goods and systems,
  such as food and water security, biodiversity and human health and safety. These
  impacts could affect commercial interests indirectly, but usually the strongest
  and most direct incentives to adapt are with the public sector. The use and
  transfer of many adaptation technologies world-wide has occurred because of
  societal interventions, not as a result of market forces. Examples of such interventions
  include direct governmental expenditures, regulations and policies and public
  choices.</p>
<p>Apart from the government being a dominant stakeholder in technology transfer
  for adaptation, four more characteristics often distinguish adaptation from
  mitigation to climate change. Each of these characteristics also represents
  a barrier to adaptation and associated technology transfer:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Uncertainty concerning the role of greenhouse gases in causing climate
    change has been reduced, but uncertainty about the location, rate and magnitude
    of impacts is still considerable, which could hamper effective anticipatory
    adaptation.</li>
  <li> Adaptation technologies will often address site-specific issues, and will
    therefore have to be designed and implemented keeping local considerations
    in mind. This could hamper large-scale technology repetition.</li>
  <li> As opposed to benefits of mitigation, which are global (reduced atmospheric
    greenhouse-gas concentrations), benefits of adaptation are primarily local.
    For this reason, adaptation projects thus far have attracted limited interest
    from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and other donors.</li>
  <li> The implementation of mitigation technologies can contribute to the development
    of a country's energy-consuming sectors, while adaptation technologies are
    primarily aimed at preventing or reducing impacts on these and other sectors.
    As such, adaptation is often not considered a development objective.</li>
</ul>
<p>In spite of adaptation often not being considered a development objective,
  governments have a number of clear incentives and opportunities to start planning
  for adaptation. For example, many adaptation technologies do not only reduce
  vulnerability to anticipated impacts of climate change but also to contemporary
  hazards associated with climate variability. It could be considered &quot;no-regret&quot;
  adaptation or &quot;climate safe development&quot;, having utility both now
  and in the future, even if climate change were not to occur. In addition, adaptation
  options need to be designed keeping site-specific natural and socio-cultural
  circumstances in mind. Strengthening technological, institutional, legal and
  economic capacities as well as raising awareness are important for effective
  adaptation and technology transfer, for no adaptation option will be successful
  when it is implemented in an environment that is not ready, willing or able
  to receive the option.</p>
