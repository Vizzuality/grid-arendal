<h3><b>5.4.2 Incentives and Barriers to Energy-Saving Investments</b></h3>
<p> At one level, it may seen sensible for a private firm to invest in GHG reductions
  only if there is an obvious financial benefit. But for many firms, greenhouse
  gas reductions can result from corporate decisions that are taken in response
  to direct economic incentives--like reduced costs, increased profits, and increased
  market share. For example, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development
  is promoting the view that corporate efforts for eco-efficiency are a sign of
  management competence, and hence will increase shareholder value (<i>e.g.,</i>
  ease raising of equity) as well as credit-worthiness (<i>e.g.,</i> ease raising
  of debt financing) (Schmidheiny and Zorraquin, 1996). A &quot;green&quot; corporate
  image can become a corporate asset, and some preliminary research in the United
  States has shown that better environmental management systems and environmental
  performance tend to reduce firms' risk profile (controlling for other factors),
  with the expectation of a positive impact on the stock price of the greener
  firms because of their reduced risk (Feldman <i>et al.,</i> 1997). The value
  of a company's equity ultimately is determined by the present value of the entire
  expected future stream of earnings (suitably discounted), so long-run concerns
  including environmental performance should have an effect on the market evaluation
  of a firm's net worth.<br>
  <br>
  Internal barriers are often overlooked, partly because economic models typically
  make the simplifying assumption that all market agents are fully maximising
  their objectives. Yet several strands of recent research have shown that private
  sector firms do not take full advantage of all the cost-effective investments
  in energy efficiency and other cleaner energy technologies that are available.
  This evidence comes from &quot;bottom-up&quot; studies (Interlaboratory Working
  Group, 1997; Energy Innovations 1997; National Laboratory Directors 1997; IPCC,
  1996, Table 9.8 and the studies cited therein), statistical tests of the maximisation
  hypothesis (DeCanio and Watkins, 1998a; DeCanio, 1998), and theoretical and
  empirical studies (Koomey, 1990; Ayers, 1993; Lovins and Lovins, 1991; Jaffe
  and Stavins, 1993; Koomey et al., 1996; DeCanio and Watkins 1998b; Porter and
  van der Linde, 1995a, 1995b). <br>
  <br>
  A number of specific intra-firm barriers to the adoption and diffusion of profitable
  energy saving and other cleaner energy technologies have been identified. In
  addition to the long-recognised tension between the goals of shareholders and
  management, managers at different levels within a firm may have conflicting
  incentives. It is often the case that data that could be used for energy auditing
  and control either is not available or is scattered through the organisation
  in such a way as to make cost-saving investments in energy efficiency more difficult.
  Capital budgeting procedures that are put in place to control principal/agent
  problems within the organisation may have the unintended side effect of screening
  out profitable energy-saving investments. Managers can be inappropriately risk
  averse because of the way their performance is evaluated, and their incentives
  to pursue energy efficiency blunted by frequent turnover or switching of positions
  within the company. Managers rarely have incentives to make the long-run decisions
  that will benefit their successors at the expense of their own performance in
  the short run (DeCanio, 1993, 1994). <br>
  <br>
  Furthermore, many firms in NIS countries (mainly Russia and Ukraine) operate
  under perverse microeconomic conditions that encourage them to under-report
  or hide revenues, expenses, and profits. Barter transactions, which make up
  a substantial percentage of economic activity in these countries, along with
  corruption in many forms, complicate matters further. Under these conditions,
  judging the financial condition of enterprises become problematic, and adds
  risk and uncertainty to energy efficiency and other types of otherwise profitable
  investments. In general, issues of corporate governance in non-monetary, distorted
  economies of some large NIS countries can represent significant barriers to
  environmentally sound technology transfer (OECD, 1997; EBRD, 1998; Commander
  and Mumssen, 1998). <br>
  <br>
  Firms are not unitary entities having a mind and will of their own. Instead,
  they are made up of a multitude of individuals, each of whom has their own individual
  interests and objectives. The decisions of firms are thus the result of collective
  action, and it has long been understood that collective action may not yield
  optimal outcomes, even if all the individuals taking part in the decision-making
  process are perfectly rational (Olson, 1965). This problem can manifest itself
  in the operation of for-profit firms just as it does in voting models of group
  choice. In both cases, the (possibly divergent) interests of individuals have
  to be 'aggregated' into organisational decisions.<sup><small><a href="fn7.htm#5" onClick="showFootnote(7,5); return false;">5</a></small></sup>
  The task of management is to bring about as much correspondence as possible
  between the interests of the individuals making up the organisation and its
  formal goals, and this task is neither straightforward nor simple. The modern
  theory of the firm is based on an exploration of the multitude of ways in which
  agency problems, asymmetric information, and incentive incompatibility can create
  a gulf between the formal objectives of the firm (maximisation of profits or
  of stock value) and the behaviour of its employees. It should come as no surprise
  that perfect maximisation is rarely achieved, and in particular that it is not
  realised in the realm of energy efficiency. <br>
