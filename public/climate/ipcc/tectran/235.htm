<h3>12.3.2 Emerging Pathways </h3>
<p>In the face of limitations of existing institutions, new mechanisms are emerging.
  Recent developments indicate an increased importance ascribed to environmental
  functions of forests and their integral role in sustainable forest management.
  These efforts include attempts to manage forests as ecological systems (taking
  into consideration forests' protective functions and their role in the conservation
  of biological diversity); adoption of reduced-impact logging systems and development
  of codes of harvesting practice; and restrictions placed on timber harvesting
  in forests in North America and some tropical Asian and Pacific countries. Environmental
  concerns have also led to certification schemes and export controls for forest
  products. The trend towards increased involvement of nearby communities in forest
  management, particularly in developing countries, allows for greater consideration
  to be given to local environmental concerns and to the social benefits derived
  locally from forests (FAO, 1997). Many Governments have regulations to promote
  adoption of sustainable forest management practices, and prevention of damage
  to forests for short-term benefits to timber companies.</p>
<p>A majority of these efforts have emerged independently of the climate change-related
  debates. Many efforts, governmental and non-governmental, national, regional
  and international, have been made to promote sustainable forest management.
  Major international initiatives include: the International Tropical Timber Organization's
  Year 2000 Objective, in which producer member countries have committed themselves
  to having all their internationally-traded tropical timber come from sustainably-managed
  forests by the year 2000; and national and regional efforts to define criteria
  and indicators for sustainable forest management, and to determine means of
  assessing progress towards achieving it. The latter involves a number of regional
  initiatives, most of which have been launched since 1995, focusing on: humid
  tropical forests in ITTO producer countries; boreal, temperate and Mediterranean
  forests in Europe (the Helsinki Process); temperate and boreal forests outside
  Europe (Montreal Process); Amazon basin forests (the Tarapoto Proposal); and
  forests in dry zone sub-Saharan Africa (the UNEP/FAO Dry-Zone Africa initiative);
  in the Near East region (FAO/UNEP Expert Meeting for the Near East); and in
  Central America (FAO/CCAD Expert Meeting on Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable
  Forest Management in Central America) and &quot;towards a sustainable paper
  cycle&quot; (World Business Council for Sustainable Development).</p>
<p>Some of the non-climate-related trends and mechanisms, which have implications
  for climate mitigation programmes, are: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Timber Certification. This activity promotes the sustainable management
    of forests by issuing &quot;green certificates&quot; according to a set of
    standard social, economic and environmental criteria. There are several certification
    schemes being developed at the regional and international levels. The most
    important of them are FSC-certification and the ISO-certification. Currently
    there are a little more than 10.3 x 10<sup>6</sup> ha in 1997 (which has increased to
    16.2 x 10<sup>6</sup> ha) of forests certified, through entities accredited, by the Forest
    Stewardship Council worldwide (FSC, 1997). The slow growth of markets for
    certified timber is still one of the main barriers for a wider and faster
    dissemination of this particular form of technology transfer.</li>
  <li> Increased forest product recycling. </li>
  <li> Adoption of reduced impact-logging practices.</li>
  <li> Substitution of fossil fuels by biofuels.</li>
</ul>
