<h1>Case Study 12</h1>

  <br>
  <b>Summary</b><br>
  The US IJI was launched in 1993 to facilitate private sector AIJ projects between 
  the United States (US) and foreign partners in developing countries and economies 
  in transition. Of the 110 proposals that were submitted to the Initiative until 
  July 1998, only 30 met the additionality and sustainability criteria for IJI 
  approval. Finally, only 13 were fully financed. The experience underscores the 
  need for clear and widely understood goals and procedures; as well as for increased 
  project financing. Transaction costs in the process were often substantial. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background</b><br>
  The first Conference of the Parties (CoP) to the Climate Change Convention authorised 
  a five year pilot phase of activities implemented jointly (AIJ) to learn more 
  about the operation of inter-country climate mitigation projects in which the 
  carbon emissions reductions were transferred from the host country to the investor 
  country. The AIJ phase sought to build confidence in the approach and to develop 
  a framework for the international implementation of such projects. The US government 
  established the US Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI) in 1993 to facilitate 
  US based private investors to finance climate mitigation projects in developing 
  countries and CEITs.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective</b><br>
  The USIJI encourages private investment in climate change mitigation projects 
  in developing and transitional economies, and enables the development and promotion 
  of a broad range of projects to test and evaluate methodologies for measuring, 
  tracking and verifying costs and benefits. The USIJI experience will contribute 
  towards the formulation of international criteria for joint implementation projects.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Approach</b><br>
  The USIJI developed a set of criteria for accepting projects. These criteria 
  include the requirements set out in the decision of the CoP (which include additionality 
  in financing and in emissions reductions), as well as other criteria that help 
  document the emissions reductions and other non-GHG benefits. By July 1998, 
  110 proposals had been submitted. Of these, 30 were approved as having met the 
  established criteria after seven rounds of proposal reviews. Finally, 13 of 
  the accepted proposals were fully financed. These projects are currently at 
  various stages of implementation. The results of project evaluations will be 
  released soon.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Impacts</b><br>
  The coal bed methane recovery project in Poland launched in October 1994 with 
  an investment of US$ 7.5 million for a commercial scale plant is estimated to 
  reduce net GHG emissions by the equivalent of more than 450 kilotons of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>. 
  Similarly the fuel switching/cogeneration in the Czech Republic was commissioned 
  in September 1996. USIJI estimates that over the 25 year lifespan of the project, 
  GHG emissions will be reduced by the equivalent of more than 600 kilotons of 
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span>. While it is still too early to assess the level of carbon emission reduction 
  and their cost effectiveness, the process has had a major impact on the design 
  of processes to promote inter-country carbon emission reduction projects. Provisions 
  establishing the CDM in the Kyoto Protocol reflect some of the experiences of 
  the Initiative.<br>
  <b><br>
  Lessons Learned</b><br>
  In the early cases, transaction costs in establishing the projects were substantial. 
  While the nature of transaction costs changed over time, they still remain somewhat 
  considerable. Project proponents regard USIJI acceptance as a major hurdle that 
  illustrates the need for clear and widely understood goals and procedures for 
  investor country approval. Some USIJI projects also became entangled in the 
  kinds of problems that bedevil other transactions in developing and transitional 
  economies, reflecting the importance of the economic and legal context of the 
  host country in project finalisation. The lack of adequate project financing 
  remains the ultimate challenge even after projects meet the approval criteria. 
  This lack of demand for GHG reduction projects needs to be urgently addressed.<br>
