<p><b>Summary</b><br>
  This case study highlights the transfer mechanisms leading to municipally and 
  cooperatively owned energy efficiency investments at the end user level in public 
  or residential buildings in Kiev. The transfer has been managed by the Agency 
  for Rational Energy Use and Ecology (ARENA-ECO, 1998) Kiev, supported by the 
  bilateral cooperation agencies of the US and Switzerland. The cooperation has 
  strengthened the capacity for implementing larger multilateral assistance projects.</p>
<p><b>Background</b><br>
  In Kiev as in many other Central and Eastern European cities, the energy for 
  heating and warm water is supplied to buildings through district heating systems 
  with high transmission/distribution losses and low energy efficiency at the 
  end user level. The supplied heat is produced on the basis of natural gas imported 
  mostly from the Russian Federation - the consumption is paid by public, commercial 
  and private building owners in local currency. With the goal of economic transformation, 
  energy pricing and related government policies are in a painful process of restructuring 
  to make prices reflect market realities at a politically acceptable social cost. 
  The energy pricing reform is interlinked with investments increasing the efficiency 
  in generation, distribution and use of the energy. A loan agreement to upgrade 
  the district heating supply infrastructure and to strengthen capacity in consumption-based 
  billing was signed between the World Bank and Kiev Energo in 1998. The US Dept. 
  of Energy (DoE) and the Swiss Agency for Cooperation and Development (SDC) as 
  bilateral donors have since 1996 supported the development of transfer models 
  for demand side management in selected public and residential buildings in cooperation 
  with the local private agency ARENA-ECO. ARENA-ECO was in charge of project 
  implementation and institutional networking. At the micro level the Swiss sponsored 
  residential building project investigated the social acceptability of DSM investments 
  at soft loan terms. The U.S. sponsored project focused on feasibility of cost-effective 
  efficiency improvements in public buildings and financing arrangements that 
  involved Ukrainian budgetary organisations and international financial institutions.</p>
<p><b>Approach</b><br>
  Both bilateral projects have demonstrated the feasibility of DSM investments 
  (regulated building substations with energy meters, building energy conservation 
  of short payback below 3 years) and software innovations in demonstration projects 
  at four schools and two cooperatively owned apartment buildings in one district 
  of Kiev.</p>
<p>Prior to investment in the residential buildings (which was pre-financed jointly 
  by the local district authorities and the Swiss agency) the cooperatives had 
  to sign a repayment agreement based on a monthly rate of 75% of the estimated 
  reduction in the energy bill. If energy prices are increased the monthly rate 
  increases in proportion. The repayments establish a fund at the level of the 
  district authorities.</p>
<p>Investments in public buildings are financed jointly from the municipal budget 
  and a World Bank loan, and the loan agreement requires ratification of sovereign 
  guarantees by the Ukrainian Parliament. The investments are repaid by reducing 
  budgetary expenditures for heat supply.</p>
<p><b>Impacts</b><br>
  By spreading information and raising awareness about the potential for energy 
  saving in the buildings sector, the two projects increase acceptability of the 
  transfer model among end-users and policymakers. The projects also help develop 
  energy service infrastructure, create new job and business opportunities and 
  improve the situation for investing public and private money in energy efficiency, 
  making the effort replicable and self-sustainable. By reducing energy consumption 
  at the end-user level by 15-25%, suggested efficiency measures reduce fuel consumption 
  by generating facilities lowering emissions of GHG and other combustion-related 
  pollutants and reducing reliance on imported fuel supplies.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  A key barrier to energy efficiency in residential or public buildings for economies 
  in transition is not the technology itself, but the policy framework for the 
  transfer mechanism needed to catalyse investments. An entirely market-based 
  technology transfer approach is not socially or politically acceptable. There 
  should be financial facilities providing softer financing, as well as mechanisms 
  encouraging investments in energy efficiency and support at the district and 
  municipal levels. Projects will only be self-sustainable if soft public finance 
  remains available.</p>
<p>Bilateral donors have played an important role in enhancing the policy dialogue 
  with stakeholders involved at the local level, in capacity-building and in facilitating 
  institutional learning.</p>
