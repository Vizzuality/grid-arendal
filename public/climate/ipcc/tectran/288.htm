<h1>14.6 Lessons learned</h1>
<p>The reduction of population vulnerability is, in general, the most cost-effective
  strategy to deal with the health impacts of climate change. In the lowest-income
  countries, where impacts are likely to be greatest, strengthening the public
  health infrastructure should be a priority. There has been a widespread decline
  in public health training, facilities, and programmes over the past decade (McCally
  et al., 1998).</p>
<p>Equally important, the health of communities will be improved by social-economic
  development that promotes income redistribution and the reduction in health
  inequalities. Impoverished populations are at greater risk of adverse health
  outcomes (such as those due to exposure to infectious agents, vulnerability
  to thermal extremes, and marginal nutritional status) because they have fewer
  choices. For populations whose health status is already compromised, the consequences
  of climate change will often be a critical further stress upon health.</p>
<p>Population health vulnerability would also be reduced by taking specific steps
  to lessen the health impacts of climate change. Examples include improved urban
  and housing design, vaccination programmes, upgraded wastewater and refuse disposal
  systems, and public education and early-warning programmes. Improved understanding
  by the public and policymakers of the potential health impacts of climate change
  is a prerequisite to reducing the impacts. This can be achieved by:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Encouragement of research institutions to pursue long-term, multidisciplinary
    research.</li>
  <li> Dissemination and public discussion of research results and risk assessments.</li>
  <li> Monitoring of, and quantification of, any early health outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>With respect to the mitigation of climate change, awareness of potential health
  impacts should be a central consideration in the public discourse. The social
  incentives for GHG mitigation would be further enhanced by market mechanisms,
  particularly pricing, that take account of human health costs. </p>
<p>With respect to the capacity of populations to adapt to climate change, public
  policies to reduce socio-economic and physical-environmental vulnerability are
  necessary. Health sector institutions and processes, however, are not able to
  deal effectively with health problems on their own. The task is multi-sectoral.
  A structured approach for cross-sectoral strategies and international cooperation
  is therefore required, entailing explicit reference to environmental health
  impact assessment of all policies. Low-income countries are unable to afford
  many of the basic health protection measures without international assistance.
  Overall, intergovernmental agreements are needed for national policy making
  and funding, and for coordinated research and monitoring to reduce the health
  impacts of climate change.</p>
