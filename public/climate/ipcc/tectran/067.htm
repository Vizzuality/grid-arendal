<h3>4.5.4 Capacity building: the needs in both developed and developing countries</h3>
<p>
  While there is general agreement that capacity building is important, the record
  of capacity building in practice so far is mixed. There are many examples of
  attempts at capacity building that have failed (UNDP/HIID, 1996; UNDP, 1997;
  ODA, 1994), and fewer successes to chronicle (for some successful examples see
  for example <a href="318.htm">Chapter 16</a> <a href="333.htm">Case Study 5</a> &quot;PV
  Solar Home Systems in Kenya&quot; and <a href="344.htm">Case study 16</a> &quot;the
  Baltic Biomass Boilers&quot;. Part of the problem is that capacity building
  is neither easy nor quick: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There is a great deal of uncertainty about precisely what capacities are
    needed and how they are developed.... Unfortunately, experience suggests that
    the necessary competencies can, at best, only be improved slowly, and that
    many of the requirements are cumulative, and involve tacit and uncodified
    knowledge that is difficult to purchase on the international market (Barnett,
    1995, pp.15-16).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> More often the donor agency's understanding or concepts of capacity development/building
  have frequently been understood to be that institutional and human capacity
  changes can be induced, that these capacities are weak and the human and institutional
  capacities can be developed or strengthened along the lines of management and
  organisational models of the donor countries. The experiences and results of
  over three decades of capacity and institutional building in sub-Saharan Africa,
  for instance, suggest that these assumptions or concepts do not necessarily
  hold (Berg, 1993). Increasingly, there is a consensus amongst both analysts
  and participants that: local involvement, in the form of traditional institutions,
  local organisations and individuals is critical to increasing national capacity.
  Further, less controlled styles of governing are required; central institutions
  need to be reorganised with attention given to creating space for them; and,
  local NGOs need institutional development (OECD, 1995). There is a need for
  extensive exchanges of experiences by the collaborating agencies. New relationships
  between donors and local actors are required (OECD, 1995). <br>
  <br>
  Because much of donor understanding about institutional issues comes from <b><i>the
  lessons of failure</i></b> over the last three decades rather than success,
  more investment needs to be made in upgrading donor understanding of capacity
  development issues (OECD, 1995). Capacity strengthening is thus needed in developed
  countries. Due to low success rates in transfer of technology, implementation
  of programmes and sustainability, some donor and MDB programmes have undertaken
  capacity-strengthening in their own organisation to develop a more participative
  and less traditional approach (Wight, 1997). &quot;Given the entrenched institutional
  bureaucracy and resistance to change in donor organisation, however, this (process
  facilitation) would require a major orientation and concerted change effort&quot;
  (Wight, 1997). Local staff recruitment for projects in particular has been identified
  as a major issue (Gray, 1997)</p>
