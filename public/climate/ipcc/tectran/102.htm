<h3>5.3.2 Initiatives within the Private Financial Sector</h3>
<p> While on one level the private financial sector has no special reason to consider
  environmental issues, many are beginning to realise, like much of the rest of
  business, that environment is a strategic issue for them, and a particular focus
  has been climate change. It is with adaptation to the impacts of climate change
  that progress has been most rapid as financial institutions recognise that climate
  change could directly affect their business. Insurance companies are increasingly
  aware that climate change could increase their losses on property and general
  insurance (e.g. from increased sea level rises and storm damage). Banks could
  also see the undermining of the security behind much of their lending. As a
  result, some insurance companies have become increasingly active, and have been
  working with others to develop and transfer technology in this area. Measures
  taken have included: adjusting premiums to reflect risks (where they are permitted
  to do so), thus sending a clearer signal about the dangers of climate change
  to owners and developers; working with local authorities on preventative measures
  such as enforcing building codes and zoning; and developing disaster recovery
  measures such as improved telephone support.<br>
  <br>
  In the other areas of climate change the mainstream financial industry has had
  a less direct impact, and to date most financial institutions have made only
  a modest commitment to supporting the development and use of mitigation technologies,
  and particularly to overcoming some of the barriers identified in <a href="094.htm">Section
  5.1</a> as preventing greater investment. However, progress has been made in
  some areas - for example, bankers no longer regard wind energy technologies
  as being a particularly high risk.<br>
  <br>
  Certain financial institutions have been prepared to innovate and show leadership
  in finance related to the environment. For example, some banks have also been
  active in working with smaller businesses to improve their environmental impact,
  often with a focus on energy efficiency, through providing advice and information.
  In doing this they hope to improve the credit standing of their clients, as
  well as secure general environmental benefits. Some banks have also instituted
  lending programmes with more favourable terms than in ordinary lending for businesses
  seeking to reduce their environmental impact.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Other initiatives within the private financial sector include:</i><br>
  <br>
  <b>Green financial institutions.</b> While most mainstream financial institutions
  have paid only modest attention to the environment, a number of smaller organisations
  or groups within organisation have made it a major feature of their activities.
  These &quot;green financiers&quot; are usually driven by, firstly, the growing
  number of investors with concerns about the environment and a desire to see
  their money invested to take account of these concerns and, secondly, a high
  level of personal commitment by the professionals involved. These green financial
  organisation are much more prepared to work to overcome some of the problems
  identified earlier, either independently or in conjunction with the public sector.
  Many of these &quot;green&quot; financiers are involved in some of the activities
  above. They include: </p>
<ul>
  <li> a number of Ecological or Social Banks (typically very small, although
    growing) that focus on providing fairly low cost lending for environmental
    and other worthy projects, and have strong links to the micro-credit movement
    (see <a href="102.htm#b53">Box 5.3</a>); </li>
  <li> environmental equity funds which invest in listed &quot;green&quot; companies
    (many billions of dollars are now invested in such funds, but they are limited
    in the extent to which they can provide money to new ventures);</li>
  <li> a few environmental venture funds and specialist corporate financiers which
    provide support to new environmental businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p> While these green financiers are still small as a proportion of the overall
  financial markets, they are providing a very useful pathfinder role in developing
  new concepts and ideas. There appears to be substantial merit in the public
  sector finding ways to support them and work with them to encourage their work.<br>

      <p>An example of a successful green financial institution is the Polish
	Environmental Protection Bank. Established at the beginning of the 1990s,
	it has received substantial equity investments from the Polish National
	Fund for Environmental Protection. Share capital has also been raised
	several times from strategic investors and from the private sector. The
	bank was listed on the Warsaw stock exchange in 1997 and became the world's
	first publicly traded bank specialising in environmental protection financing.
	In 1997, the bank granted over 27,000 individual credits and loans worth
	PLZ 1,431 million (363 million Euros). The bank lends primarily to businesses
	(54 %), municipalities and other public-sector entities (26 %) and individuals.Specific
	environmental investments make up two thirds of the bank's portfolio.
	The bank held a one-per cent share of the banking market in Poland (in
	terms of total assets of all commercial banks), and it has built up a
	good reputation for quality of services as well as for financial performance.</p>

  <b>Collective initiatives and organisations.</b> In recent years a number of
  initiatives and organisations have been created to bring together industry participants
  to look at environmental issues as a collective basis. The most notable have
  been the UNEP initiatives, where banks and insurance companies have signed a
  statement on the environment, and subsequently the signatories have formed organisations
  to develop further activities. Other organisations have developed, mostly at
  a national level, to further the cause of environmental investment, such as
  the Social Investment Forum (US), UK Social Investment Forum, VfU (Verein fur
  Umweltmanagement in Banken und Versicherung) in Germany/Switzerland and the
  Social Venture Network (US). These organisations provide forums for networking,
  information gathering and sharing experiences. They also have been involved
  in lobbying for change and encouraging investment and green finance.</p>
