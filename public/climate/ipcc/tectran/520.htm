<h3>2.3.4 Multilateral Development Banks</h3>
<p>The Multilateral Development Banks (MDB) have seen technology transfer as part
  of their mission to encourage development. More recently they started to focus
  on the challenges of the environment and the specific problems involved in transferring
  environmental technology. In response many have started to develop a range of
  initiatives and activities.</p>
<p>In particular, development banks have become aware of the role they can play
  in helping to mobilise private capital to help meet the needs of sustainable
  development and the environment, and of the potential to use financial innovation
  to encourage environmental projects and initiatives. While much of the earlier
  work they did was sporadic, the private sector arms of the Multilateral Development
  Banks are now seeking to identify ways they can work with international private
  capital to help address environmental and developmental needs.</p>
<p>The World Bank, including its affiliate the International Finance Corporation,
  has developed a number of initiatives with the potential to support environmental
  technology transfer. These include financing a number of environmental lending
  programmes at domestic financial institutions, meant for local industries. An
  important new initiative is the Carbon Investment Fund. This is a vehicle which
  will provide additional finance for CO<span class="subscript">2</span> mitigating
  projects in return for carbon offsets, i.e. the right to transfer the credit
  for the CO<span class="subscript">2</span> saved to the investor. It is expected
  to have a substantial private sector component.</p>
<p>The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), is the only one
  to have sustainable development incorporated in its charter. It is also quite
  active in working with the private sector . Thus it is not surprising that it
  has shown a fair amount of leadership in helping to encourage technology transfer.
  Examples of its initiatives include working with intermediary banks to educate
  them on environmental issues and the potential of clean technology, and activities
  to support the development of Energy Service Companies.</p>
<p>Other MDBs, such as the regional development banks (African Development Bank,
  AfDB, Asian Development Bank, ADB, Inter-American Development Bank , IDB) all
  play an important role in regional investment, and most have given some attention
  to issues of sustainable development, in varied ways. The European Investment
  Bank is also a huge investor, internationally particularly to the Asia-Pacific-Caribbean
  countries under the Lom&eacute; Convention; its investment programmes however
  have not generally been co-ordinated with the EU's goals on sustainable development
  and climate change. </p>
<p>Governments can use their leverage to direct the activities of multilateral
  development banks through their respective Boards and Councils in order to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Strengthen MDB programmes to account for the environmental consequences
    of their lending;</li>
  <li> Develop programmatic approaches to lending that remove institutional barriers
    and create enabling environments for private technology transfers;</li>
  <li> Encourage MDBs to participate in NSI partnership initiatives;</li>
  <li> Pay special attention to South-South technology transfer.</li>
</ul>
