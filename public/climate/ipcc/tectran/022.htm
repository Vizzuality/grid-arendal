<h3>2.2.2 Official Development Assistance and Official Aid</h3>
<p><i>Issues</i><br>
  ODA/OA remains the main conduit for government supported technology transfer
  efforts, particularly those aimed at the poorest developing countries. By definition,
  support to a developing country counted as Official Development Assistance must
  be both developmental and concessional. ODA statistics are collected from members
  of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC), which consists of 21 OECD
  member governments (of 29 total) and the Commission of the European Communities
  (see also <a href="097.htm">Section 5.2.2</a> on ODA). </p>
<p>DAC statistics describe aid flows (grants and loans) to recipients by major
  category of expenditure. In addition to ODA/OA, data are collected on other
  official flows, private market transactions, and assistance from non-governmental
  organisations to each recipient country and recipient countries combined. The
  OECD also reports on development assistance provided by other groups (OECD,
  1998a).</p>
<p>ODA involves much more than technology transfer and looking at overall ODA
  trends tells little about actual financial flows for this purpose, except to
  set an upper limit on official government transfers. The OECD's Creditor Reporting
  System (CRS) is an information system comprising more detailed data on the components
  of ODA and other lending by the official sector. Data relate to individual grant
  and loan commitments and specify their purpose, tying status, and, for loans,
  terms of repayment. The DAC Secretariat converts the amounts of the projects
  into US dollars using annual average exchange rates. Approximately 15,000 transactions
  are recorded annually. The CRS does not report details on aid flows from NGOs,
  non-DAC donors, FDI, unguaranteed bank lending, or portfolio investment (Felcke,
  1997). </p>
<p>DAC/CRS statistics on the purpose of aid cover three dimensions: the sector
  of destination, the nature or form of the aid, and the policy objectives of
  the aid. Three of 26 principal sectors (broken down into some 200 sub-sectors)
  have a plausibly stronger relationship to climate change: energy generation
  and supply, transport, and industry. In principle, the CRS can be used to identify
  how much ODA (and to a lesser degree OA) is directed to these sectors. Non-sector
  specific aid to the environment is contained within the &quot;multi-sector/cross-cutting&quot;
  category.</p>
<p>The policy objectives of aid efforts are tracked across most sectors and forms
  of aid using a &quot;marker system&quot; introduced several years ago to support
  changing DAC policy objectives. The marker system facilitates monitoring aid
  in relation to cross-cutting themes (that is, issues that can be addressed through
  aid activities across all economic sectors), such as environment. Donor governments
  are supposed to report an environment-oriented policy objective for aid if the
  activity 1) is intended to produce an improvement in the physical or biological
  environment of the recipient country, area, or target group concerned or 2)
  &quot;includes specific action to integrate environmental concerns with a range
  of development objectives through institution building and/or capacity development&quot;
  (OECD, 1997b). The marker system is not used by all donor governments. In the
  sectors of transport, energy and industry, however, the data are reasonably
  complete since 1996.</p>
<p>The DAC has recently begun a pilot study with the secretariats of the conventions
  on biological diversity, desertification, and climate change to see whether
  the marker system can be strengthened to allow tracking of developed country
  financial assistance required under those conventions. The goal is to avoid
  creating new and possibly overlapping reporting requirements for donor governments.
  If implemented fully the expanded marker system would track ODA directed to
  sectors relevant to the objectives of the UNFCCC (see section 3.4), including
  buildings, transport, industry, energy, agriculture, forestry, waste management
  and coastal adaptation. Results of the pilot study will be available in March
  2000 from the DAC Working Party on Statistics, and will be presented to SBSTA
  12 in June 2000 (UNFCCC, 1999).</p>
<p>Apart from operating various reporting systems, the DAC helps donor governments
  share information about each other's aid programmes to promote coordination
  and avoid overlap. In November 1996, the OECD Working Party on Development Assistance
  and Environment gathered basic information about donor strategies, policies
  and programmes involving what it called &quot;cleaner technology&quot; (OECD,
  1997a). In their responses to a questionnaire, about half the donors identified
  cleaner technology as a major focus of their technology cooperation activities.
  The other half of the donors responding reported minor or negligible emphasis
  on cleaner technology approaches.</p>
<p>Support for overall capacity development to use cleaner technology was the
  most important goal of activities directed towards cleaner technology. Demonstration
  projects, training, and education were the main instruments used. This highlights
  the importance of ODA/OA in leveraging funds for technology transfer, particularly
  in developing capacity to make good technology choices and use improved technologies.</p>
<p>Virtually all donors saw the private sector in developing countries as a major
  target for cleaner technology activities, with the establishment of joint ventures
  between enterprises in their countries and developing countries a primary goal.
  This blurring of the formerly distinct role of government in ODA is one characteristic
  change in recent years; many governments now view their primary role in technology
  transfer as facilitating the role of the private sector in transferring hardware
  and skills, particularly those from the donating country. The creation of networks
  between business associations in industrialised and developing countries and
  the development of new types of public-private partnerships were identified
  as areas of growing interest for donors.</p>
<p>In the majority of donor countries aid organisations are not the only agencies
  supporting the transfer of environmental technology. Environment and trade departments,
  export promotion agencies, and research and development agencies are also involved
  in ODA efforts related to cleaner technologies, pointing to the need for coordination
  within both donor and recipient governments.</p>
<p>Ten donors responding to the OECD survey reported using export promotion programmes
  to support the transfer of environmental technologies, although the promotion
  of environmental technology is not always an explicit goal of such schemes.
  Risk funds and seed funds, as well as financing for small-scale investment,
  were identified as special financing instruments to support cleaner technology.
  Financing for patent right acquisition is generally not provided.</p>
<p><i>ODA Trends</i><br>
  The OECD (1999c) reported that in 1998 ODA reversed a five year downward trend,
  rising to US$51.5 billion from US$47.6 billion in 1997, an almost nine per cent
  increase in real terms (<a href="fig221.htm">Figure 2.1</a>). Official aid to
  economies in transition amounted to some US$5.4 billion in 1998, a slight decrease
  from 1997. The technical cooperation component of ODA in 1997 was US$13 billion,
  with some US$1.3 billion spent on students and trainees.</p>
<p>The OECD's summary of 1998 ODA (OECD, 1999c) notes that the recovery in aid
  in 1998 was in part due to the timing of contributions to multilateral agencies
  and short-term measures to deal with the Asian crisis, but also reflected some
  members' commitments to maintain or increase aid flows. Fourteen of the 21 DAC
  Members reported a rise in ODA in real terms, but the percentage of GNP spent
  on ODA averaged 0.23 percent for DAC member countries; only Norway and Sweden
  maintained ODA above the United Nations target of 0.7 percent of GNP (OECD,
  1999c). </p>
<p>Looking at trends, DAC countries' ODA to transport, energy, and industry sectors
  in 1993 to 1997 amounted to US$47 billion. In comparison to their total bilateral
  ODA, aid to transport (US$24 billion) was nine per cent, aid to energy generation
  and supply (US$20 billion) eight per cent, and aid to industry (US$3.5 billion)
  one per cent. </p>
<p>Aid to transport can be further broken down to road, rail, water and air transport.
  Half of all activities were to support road transport and one-fourth to support
  rail transport. Water and air transport received 15 per cent of aid to transport
  each. On the basis of the &quot;aid to environment&quot; marker data (which
  are reasonably complete since 1996), over 60 per cent of aid activities in the
  transport sector addressed environmental concerns as a significant objective.
</p>
<p>Regarding aid to energy projects, CRS data allow a distinction between that
  directed to renewable and non-renewable sources. Roughly one-third of aid to
  energy in 1993 to 1998 was allocated to &quot;renewable sources&quot;, one-third
  to &quot;non-renewable sources&quot; and one-third to electrical transmission
  and distribution. Hydro-power is by far the largest component (75 per cent)
  in the renewable category, but aid activities in the field of geothermal, solar
  and wind power have been increasing during the last few years. Projects involving
  coal-fired power plants make up the largest component in the non-renewable energy
  generation category. Over 70 per cent of all aid activities in the energy sector,
  and 95 per cent involving coal-fired power plants, were marked against aid to
  environment as a significant objective.</p>
<p>Aid to industry has decreased during the 1990s. In particular, there has been
  a substantial drop in aid to fertiliser, chemicals and cement manufacturing,
  and to the basic metal and transport equipment industries. Industrial development
  and SME development are at present the largest sub-sectors. Approximately 40
  per cent of aid to industry are reported as having environment as a significant
  objective.</p>
<p>Finally, there has been an increase in aid flows to general environmental protection.
  This may be partly due to the revision of the DAC sector classification in 1996,
  which clarified the reporting of environment-related aid activities. The total
  for 1993 to 1997 was close to US$5 billion. Slightly over 20 per cent of this
  amount was reported to be for flood prevention/control, nine per cent for biosphere
  protection (air pollution control, ozone layer preservation and marine pollution
  control) and eight per cent for biodiversity conservation. The remainder was
  reported as aid to environmental policy/administrative management and unspecified
  environmental protection activities. </p>
<p>The sectoral data can be broken down by recipient, giving some idea about aid
  targeting by donor countries. Bilateral aid to energy, for example, has been
  highly concentrated on Asia, the region with the largest growth in CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  emissions. The ten largest Asian recipients - India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan,
  Philippines, Thailand, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh - have received
  63 per cent of DAC Members' bilateral aid to energy since 1980. The extent to
  which aid has influenced the path of energy development depends on the relative
  importance of ODA in overall energy sector finance. But as noted above, aid
  can contribute in ways that are not quantifiable, transfer of technology through
  aid projects also means transfer of knowledge, which in turn can influence developing
  countries' internal investments in energy infrastructure. The DAC's pilot study
  with the FCCC Secretariat referred to above is examining this relationship,
  as well as the targeting of aid in other climate change related sectors. </p>
<p>The OECD notes that the general decrease in ODA has occurred during a period
  in which there have been widespread improvements in the economic and budgetary
  situations of DAC Member countries. The G8 Summit leaders meeting in May 1998
  reconfirmed the commitment to mobilising resources for development, including
  a goal (among others) of promoting environmental sustainability in developing
  countries. The organisation notes that &quot;... without a renewed commitment
  to invest adequate and well targeted resources, progress cannot be expected
  and achievement of the internationally agreed goals will be jeopardised&quot;
  (OECD, 1998a).</p>
