<h1>Executive Summary </h1>
<p>Governments and international agencies have a variety of policy tools for overcoming
  key barriers and creating enabling environments for technology transfer. Barriers
  and policy tools are discussed broadly in this chapter according to ten dimensions
  of enabling environments:</p>
<ol>
  <li> <i><b>National systems of innovation.</b></i> Technology transfers are
    influenced greatly by what have been called national systems of innovation--the
    institutional and organisational structures which support technological development
    and innovation. Governments can build or strengthen scientific and technical
    educational institutions and modify the form or operation of technology networks-the
    interrelated organisations generating, diffusing, and utilising technologies.</li>
  <li> <b><i>Social infrastructure and participatory approaches.</i></b> Social
    movements, community organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs)
    contribute to the &quot;social infrastructure&quot; that plays an important
    and enabling role in many forms of technology transfer. Governments can devise
    participatory mechanisms and adopt processes to harness the networks, skills
    and knowledge of civil society, including community groups and NGOs, to better
    meet user needs, avoid delays and achieve greater success with technology
    transfer.</li>
  <li><b><i>Human and institutional capacities.</i></b> There are many failures
    of technology transfer that result from an absence of human and institutional
    capacity. Although much of the focus on capacity building has been on enhancing
    scientific and technical skills, other skills for selecting, managing, adapting,
    and financing technologies are equally important. Capacity building is a slow
    and complex process to which long-term commitments must be made. For adaptation
    there is a need: to strengthen scientific and policy institutions to enable
    the undertaking of assessments and, to access datasets, tools and techniques
    to produce outputs for nationally determined priorities. </li>
  <li> <b><i>Macroeconomic policy frameworks.</i></b> Macroeconomic policies include
    direct and indirect financial support, energy tariff policies, trade and foreign
    investment policies, and financial sector regulation and strengthening. </li>
  <li><b> <i>Sustainable markets.</i></b> Sustainable market approaches are important
    for renewable energy and energy efficiency technology transfer because these
    approaches promote replicable, ongoing technology transfers. Governments can
    conduct market transformation programmes that focus simultaneously on both
    technology supply (production technologies and product designs) and demand
    (subsidies, consumer education and marketing).</li>
  <li><b> <i>National legal institutions.</i></b> National legal institutions
    are needed to secure intellectual property rights; reduce contract, property,
    and regulatory risks; and promote good governance and eliminate corruption.
    To these ends, governments can strengthen national legal institutions for
    intellectual property protection; and strengthen administrative and law processes
    to assure transparency, participation in regulatory policy-making, and independent
    review.</li>
  <li><i><b> Codes, standards and certification.</b></i> The importance and the
    need for technical standards, codes and certification have been well recognised
    by the technical community all over the world. If standards and codes are
    absent, transaction costs can increase as each buyer must ascertain the quality
    and functionality of potential technologies individually, raising transaction
    costs.</li>
  <li><b> <i>Equity considerations.</i></b> Equity in technology transfer can
    be enhanced by devising analytical tools and providing training for social
    impact assessment, requiring social impact assessments before technology is
    selected, and creating compensatory mechanisms for 'losers'. Governments may
    also wish to develop criteria for ensuring that technology transfer projects
    do not disempower or negatively influence weaker social groups in a society.</li>
  <li> <b><i>Rights to productive resources.</i></b> Rights to productive resources
    can be affected by technology transfer, including land (agriculture, forestry),
    natural resources (forests, water, coastal areas), factories, and other productive
    resources. Successful introduction of new technologies or modification of
    resource use often depends on a recognition of the existing forms of resource
    rights, or on taking steps to create an optimal resource rights regime.</li>
  <li> <i><b>Research and technology development.</b></i> Developing countries'
    research and technology development efforts are often adaptive, following
    externally developed technology, thus suggesting the need for additional indigenous
    innovative capacity. Governments can develop science and educational infrastructure
    by building public research laboratories, providing targeted research grants,
    strengthening technical education, and directly investing in research and
    development.</li>
