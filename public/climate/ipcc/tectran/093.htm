<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p> Financing is an important dimension of environmentally sound technology transfer.
  This chapter looks at the practical issues involved in conducting technology
  transfers, and explores a wide range of mechanisms and approaches. Initiatives
  need to be carefully tailored to the relevant circumstances and objectives.
  Many environmentally sound technologies (ESTs) are essentially new - often requiring
  change and innovation in the relevant institutions to support their transfer,
  such as new partnerships, new financing mechanisms, new information distribution,
  and new models for participation.<br>
  <br>
  Public finance has a crucial role in supporting transfer of ESTs, especially
  in the absence of pricing that incorporates environmental costs. Public finance
  has different roles than private finance, which can vary by investment type
  and sector. For example, it is more important for long-term and infrastructure
  investments. Public finance remains central in the coastal zone adaptation and
  transport sectors, and still plays a large role in the energy sector despite
  growing private finance in some countries. There has been increasing interest
  in opening public infrastructure development to the private sector, for example,
  by privatising state owned companies, opening markets to competition, and opening
  projects to private finance.<br>
  <br>
  Official Development Assistance (ODA) is still significant for the economies
  of the poorest developing countries. There is increasing recognition that ODA
  can best be focused on mobilising and multiplying additional financial resources.
  ODA can also assist the improvement of policy frameworks and take on long-term
  commitments to capacity building. Donor coordination by the host country is
  key to avoiding distortions such as those induced by tied aid, which can be
  detrimental to the technology transfer process, preventing the establishment
  of the institutions to support technology choice, financing, operation and management,
  etc. More generally, trade support (<i>e.g.,</i> export credits) rarely takes
  account of environmental factors and may in many respects be biased against
  environmentally sound technologies.<br>
  <br>
  Because of the ongoing shift in many countries from the public to the private
  sector as a principal source of finance, maximising the support for technology
  transfer may require a new degree of financial innovation and an increased emphasis
  on new or different forms of finance such as microcredit, leasing and venture
  capital. While the private sector has started a number of environmental initiatives,
  there is scope for governments to enhance these mechanisms through partnerships.<br>
  <br>
  There is a need for adequate resources to enable adequate project preparation
  in the agreement stage of all pathways, yet this is precisely the area where
  funding can be most difficult to obtain, particularly for private-sector-driven
  and community-driven pathways. Project preparation needs to consider issues
  of financing and participation. There is wide scope for governments, both industrialised
  and developing, as well as multilateral organisations, to provide support directly
  for the project preparation process in private-sector-driven and community-driven
  pathways.<br>
  <br>
  Public-private partnerships are becoming increasingly important, because the
  relationship between government and private finance has changed considerably
  in recent years in many countries. These partnerships can involve a mixture
  of governments at national and local levels, private firms (companies), private
  financial institutions, and non-governmental organisations. Examples include
  voluntary agreements, technology partnerships, information dissemination to
  the financial sector and support for the development of innovative financial
  instruments. There have been a number of examples in these areas, many of them
  funded by the multilateral development banks and the Global Environment Facility
  (GEF). <br>
  <br>
  Technology intermediaries are an important form of financing and/or partnership
  that can overcome barriers associated with information, management, technology,
  and financing. Information clearinghouses are simple forms of technology intermediaries,
  but policies can create an environment that encourages more sophisticated forms
  of technology intermediaries, such as technology-specific national-level institutions,
  energy-service companies, and electric power utilities.<br>
  <br>
  There is scope for governments to more formally organise, develop and report
  on the practical initiatives they undertake in support of environmentally sound
  technology transfer. A formal programme could monitor activities, disseminate
  best practices, and develop new ideas and initiatives. These initiatives could
  encompass a variety of action-oriented interventions that support technology
  transfer, typically based on addressing specific problems, and incorporating
  both private- and public-sector involvement.</p>
