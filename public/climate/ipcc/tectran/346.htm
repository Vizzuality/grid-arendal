  <br>
  <b>Summary</b><br>
  Technology for utilising local biomass fuels in the Baltic States was transferred
  from Swedish firms to local Baltic heating enterprises. The projects were considered
  highly viable from an economic and financial perspective. In addition to providing
  financing and risk-reduction mechanisms, Sweden provided capacity building that
  emphasized new managerial and financial skills that did not exist in the formerly
  planned economies. Joint ventures in the host countries were established.<br>
  <b><br>
  Background</b><br>
  In 1993, the Swedish government, through the agency NUTEK (Swedish National
  Board for Industrial and Technical Development) began a programme to assist
  district-heat-supply companies in the Baltic region (Northwest Russia, Poland,
  Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) to convert coal-fired and oil-fired heating
  boilers to burn local biomass fuels. The technology is well-proven, having been
  used at 4,000 sites in Sweden and in several other countries over 25 years.
  The technology is compatible with many of the small boilers used in the Baltics,
  an important factor for the viability of the programme. One programme goal was
  to reduce CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, SO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emissions on a sustainable basis through cost-effective
  projects. Another goal was to encourage partnerships between Swedish and Baltic
  commercial firms and promote technology transfer of boiler conversion technology
  to the Baltic firms.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Approach</b><br>
  The programme was designed to overcome key barriers to technology transfer:
  lack of financing, project performance risks, unavailability of the technology
  in the Baltics, lack of understanding by boiler owners of the feasibility and
  economic benefits of the technology, missing management skills, and lack of
  financial analysis and competitive-bidding procurement capabilities. <br>
  <br>
  NUTEK administered financing of the boiler conversion projects with 10-year
  loans at 7-8% interest and a three-year grace period. NUTEK reduced project
  performance risk associated with future biomass fuel prices by guaranteeing
  a 15% minimum fuel-cost reduction independent of relative biomass and oil prices.
  NUTEK provided technical assistance, in the form of local consultants able to
  speak the local languages, for understanding the technical feasibility and economic
  benefits of the boiler conversions. NUTEK staff also provided technical assistance
  to boiler owners for issuing tenders, evaluating bids, selecting suppliers,
  negotiating biofuels supply contracts, and operating the converted boilers.
  Boiler owners were responsible for making decisions and applying for participation
  in the programme, and awarding equipment bids. They are also responsible for
  repaying the loan to the Swedish government. Almost SEK 300 million was spent
  on the programme, mostly as loans.<br>
  <br>
  To encourage joint ventures between Swedish and Baltic companies, the programme
  encouraged foreign firms to have a local Baltic partner when bidding on the
  projects, and to include local suppliers and service firms whenever possible.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Impacts</b><br>
  The first conversion, a 6 MW boiler in Estonia, was completed in 1993 in a six-month
  period. By 1997, about 30 boiler conversion projects had been completed. These
  projects were considered highly viable from an economic and financial perspective,
  with simple payback times of about 3 to 6 years at the beginning of the programme.
  As the prices of biomass fuels increased over time relative to conventional
  fuels, payback times increased but remained attractive.<br>
  <br>
  The programme has been successful in promoting technology transfer, capacity
  building, and institutional development in the Baltics. The programme has helped
  create a self-sustaining biomass-equipment industry, biomass-fuel markets and
  supply infrastructure, and a positive public attitude toward biomass fuels.
  A commercial biomass-fuel market did not exist in these countries prior to the
  programme, but the programme has now provided a market for industrial wood wastes.
  Two major joint ventures between Baltic and Swedish manufacturers were established,
  and a third Baltic manufacturer forged technology cooperation links with Swedish
  and Danish firms.<br>
  <br>
  <b><br>
  Lessons Learned</b><br>
  Technology transfer has been greatly facilitated by the capacities built among
  local companies--especially the managerial and financial skills that were lacking
  in the formerly planned economies. The success of the programme results from
  providing not just financing, but also technical assistance for learning how
  to make the most effective use of capital, estimate costs, conduct financial
  rate-of-return evaluations, bid and evaluate international tenders, write contracts,
  and manage the projects. Projects have had low per-ton carbon abatement costs.
  Sweden has chosen to finance projects primarily by Project financing through
  loans on favourable terms rather than grants has promoted commercial accountability
  and sustainability of the projects.<br>
