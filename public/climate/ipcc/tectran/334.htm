<h1>Case Study 6</h1>
<p> <b>Coal Power Plants in China </b></p>

<p><b>Keywords</b>: CCT, financing, low NO<span class="subscript">x</span> burners, China</p>
<p><b>Summary</b><br>
  A recent example of innovative financing of a clean coal technology (CCT) in
  a developing country is the Huaneng Power Project in China. In this case, the
  CCT manufacturer worked proactively together with export credit agencies (ECAs)
  and commercial banks to arrange financing, for the benefit of all stakeholders.
  In this example, the ECAs' contributions were a vital catalyst for the sourcing
  of funds for the utility to develop its power stations. This highlights the
  importance of ECAs, and the need for manufacturers to be proactive in arranging
  finance.</p>
<p><b>Background</b><br>
  In 1997, Huaneng Power International Inc. (HPI), a Chinese utility and a subsidiary
  of the Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP), financed three new power stations
  from funds raised by share issues on the international stock markets and by
  using export credit finance for the procurement of western equipment. From the
  CCT manufacturer's perspective, the transaction was a typical sale to an 'on
  balance sheet' purchase by a utility company in a foreign market. Because of
  the country risk for this market, the CCT manufacturer and the commercial banks
  required the involvement of ECAs.</p>
<p><b>Approach</b><br>
  HPI had a charter from MOEP to procure first-class boiler and turbine equipment
  from western suppliers. HPI financed its power station development from funds
  raised by share issues on the international stock markets and by using export
  credit finance for the procurement of western equipment. The share issues resulted
  in 25% of the company being owned by international investors. Three new power
  700MW power stations were built at Dandong, Dalian and Fuzhou. The western equipment
  was supplied by Mitsui Babcock Energy Limited (MBEL), Westinghouse and Siemens.
  MBEL supplied the boiler equipment and Westinghouse and Siemens supplied the
  steam turbine equipment. The boilers are fitted with 24 low-NO<span class="subscript">x</span> burners, a CCT
  at the commercially available stage. These burners are rated at 51.6 MWth, and
  NO<span class="subscript">x</span> is guaranteed at 300ppm (6% O<span class="subscript">2</span> dry) over a range of coals.</p>
<p>To finance the western power station equipment buyer credit facilities were
  arranged by the manufacturers. To achieve this, the manufacturers approached
  commercial banks and ECAs. The buyer credit was in the form of commercial bank
  loans for HPI, provided by a consortium of banks. Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Generale
  and Barclays Bank plc led the lending group of five major banks in these contracts.
  To enable these commercial banks to make these loans available, export credit
  backing was required. This was arranged with the ECAs from the manufacturers'
  countries: ECGD from the UK and EXIM bank from the USA. ECGD acted as loan guarantor
  to Barclays, and Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Generale and EXIM bank provided loans.
</p>
<p>The export credit financing for the western equipment can be summarised as
  follows:</p>

    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>ECG</td>
    <td>EXIM</td>

    <td>158 million US$</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fuzhou</td>
    <td>92 million US$</td>
    <td>47 million US$</td>
  </tr>

<p> In addition, for the Fuzhou project, KfW, a German ECA, supported Siemens
  in turbine financing.</p>
<p><b>Impacts</b><br>
  The low-NO<span class="subscript">x</span> burners are designed to fire a range of high ash, high volatile
  coals. There are also wide-scale plans to retrofit existing boilers with low-NO<span class="subscript">x</span>
  burners. There is a reduction of over 60% in NO<span class="subscript">x</span> emission levels compared to
  conventional burners. Emissions of NO<span class="subscript">x</span> can typically be reduced from 430-450
  g/GJ to 170 g/GJ.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  This example illustrates typical 'on balance sheet' financing for a CCT and
  demonstrates the importance of ECAs in export credit financing. The need for
  manufacturers to be proactive in arranging finance is clearly demonstrated.</p>
