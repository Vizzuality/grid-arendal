<h1>3.7 Solid Waste Management and Wastewater Treatment </h1>
<p>Methane is generated from solid waste and wastewater through anaerobic decomposition.
  Together, solid waste and wastewater disposal and treatment represent about
  20 percent of human-induced methane emissions. Emissions are expected to grow
  in the future, with the largest increases coming from developing countries.
  Methane emissions can be reduced in many ways, including reducing waste generation
  (source reduction), diverting waste away from disposal sites (i.e., through
  composting, recycling, or incineration), recovering methane generated from the
  waste, or ensuring that waste does not decompose in an anaerobic environment.
  In general, any technique or technology that reduces methane generation or converts
  methane into carbon dioxide through combustion will reduce greenhouse gases.
  The most effective mitigation approaches are those that either reduce overall
  methane generation (because methane collection efficiencies rarely approach
  100%) or ensure that the combusted methane is substituted for fossil-based energy.</p>
<p>Extensive technology transfer aimed at improving waste management is underway
  both within and between countries, although most activities have been, and will
  likely continue to be, domestic in nature. In many regions, large investments
  are still required to provide adequate waste management services. In the past,
  the climate-related impacts of waste management choices were not routinely considered.
  Mitigation technologies can be readily deployed in this sector, however, and
  provide benefits beyond the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, such as reduced
  landfill space requirements or additional energy generation through methane
  recovery. </p>
<p>Governments play a predominant role for technology transfer in the waste management
  sector , with several levels of government (from the national to the municipal
  level) participating. Key government priorities include the establishing of
  appropriate policy and regulatory frameworks, supporting the expansion of private
  sector participation, participating in technical assistance and capacity building
  activities, particularly with community groups, and in some cases providing
  incentives to catalyse desirable actions.</p>
<p>Historically, the private sector (including both domestic and multinational
  firms, as well as more informal local enterprises) and community-based organisations
  have been somewhat limited participants in government-driven technology transfer.
  The private sector has an increasingly important role, however, because meeting
  future waste management needs depends on expanded private investment. Private
  sector driven pathways are already used routinely for some types of investments
  (such as methane recovery at landfills), and efforts are underway to expand
  private sector participation across the full range of waste management services
  and technologies. The involvement of community organisations is also increasing
  as the link between community support and project sustainability has become
  clear. Soliciting local input and providing local training are two ways of ensuring
  sustainability. In many areas, locally developed and implemented projects are
  also being used to quickly address serious local concerns.</p>
<p>Technology transfer of waste management systems between countries will be confronted
  with many barriers, including limited financing, especially for South-South
  financing, limited institutional capabilities, jurisdictional complexity and
  lack of clear regulatory and investment frameworks and an overemphasis on projects
  at the expense of capacity building activities.</p>
<p>Mitigation projects can be successfully integrated into larger waste management
  efforts provided they are able to meet the needs and priorities of end-users,
  decision-makers, and financial supporters. However, mitigation projects may
  confront additional barriers, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Lack of familiarity with the potential to reduce methane generation or
    capture the methane emissions associated with waste management; </li>
  <li> Unwillingness or inability to commit additional human or financial resources
    to investigating and addressing the climactic implications of the waste management
    project; and</li>
  <li> Additional institutional complexity when new groups, representing issues
    such as energy generation or by-product marketing, are incorporated into the
    project.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><br>
  Key issues for technology transfer in solid waste management and waste water
  treatment<br>
  </b>The review of the waste management sector in the Report reveals several
  key findings. This sector can contribute to greenhouse gas mitigation in ways
  that are economically viable and meet many social priorities. Already, extensive
  technology transfer is underway, and it will continue due to the continuing
  need to provide and improve waste management services for the world's population.
  In this sector it is important that projects emphasise the deployment of locally
  appropriate technologies, and minimise the development of conventional large,
  integrated waste management systems (with their attendant financial, institutional
  and technical requirements) in situations where lower cost, simpler alternative
  waste management technologies can be used.</p>
<p><i>Policy and Regulatory Development</i><br>
  Bilateral or multilateral regulatory or policy development assistance can be
  very useful to countries seeking to develop an appropriate framework for waste
  management. Given the importance of the regulatory/policy framework for international
  private sector investment, private firms should be encouraged to participate
  in such bilateral activities. When considering technology transfer between countries
  aimed at improving regulatory or policy frameworks, it is important to recognise
  differences between host and donor countries, and to ensure that the proper
  solutions are developed. </p>
<p><i>Innovative Financing Approaches</i><br>
  The private sector can participate in technology transfer in the waste management
  sector by serving as the developer of bilateral or multilateral funded projects
  or through direct investment. Private sector opportunities for direct investment
  are emerging, however, and many countries are increasingly seeking private participation
  in waste projects. </p>
<p>Technology transfer aimed at assisting government agencies, particularly at
  the municipal level, to privatise or otherwise encourage private participation
  may be useful. Especially in developing countries, however, the structure and
  function of the existing waste management system is likely to be very different
  from the norm in developed countries. If these differences are not recognised
  and addressed, attempts to emulate developed country models can fail. </p>
<p><i>Capacity Building</i><br>
  Many bilateral technical assistance and capacity building activities are already
  underway in the waste management sector. The Report discusses several types
  of technology transfer for capacity building within countries, and many of the
  same approaches can be used between countries. Some areas of capacity building
  may be particularly appropriate for bilateral activities, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Training to facilitate public participation;</li>
  <li> Training in financial management;</li>
  <li> Training in alternative technologies;</li>
  <li> Training in formulating business plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>Existing and future capacity building activities in the waste management area
  can be readily expanded to facilitate the transfer of mitigation technologies.
  Activities could include increased emphasis on the climate impacts of various
  technologies as part of basic technical assistance programmes, developing specific
  decision tools and information for assessing climate impacts, and working with
  government counterparts on how to encourage mitigation technologies using a
  menu of voluntary, regulatory and incentive-based programmes. Expanded involvement
  of local and regional government officials from both donor and host countries
  would be beneficial, given their role in project development and implementation.
  Given the still emerging understanding of these issues, technical assistance
  activities in all directions (North-North, North-South, South-North, and South-South)
  are likely to be useful.</p>
<p><i>Incentives</i><br>
  The Kyoto Protocol will likely provide important incentives for expanded activities
  between governments to develop mitigation projects. Provisions related to both
  the Clean Development Mechanism and emissions trading could encourage expanded
  bilateral investments in projects in exchange for emission reduction units.</p>
