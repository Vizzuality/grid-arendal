<p>In 1995, the transport sector accounted for 26.5% of total final energy consumption
  and 22% of carbon emissions from energy use (OECD, 1997; IPCC, 1996). Transport
  related carbon emissions including international aviation bunkers but excluding
  marine bunkers was the fastest growing between 1990 to 1995, with an annual
  rate of 2.4%. This growth occurred globally but not evenly. In 1995, Annex II
  countries accounted for 66% of the total, though emissions from developing countries
  are increasing their share. Similarly, per capita transport emissions are uneven,
  in 1995 it was 3.33 t CO<span class="subscript">2</span>/capita in Annex II
  as compared to 0.29 t CO<span class="subscript">2</span>/capita in non-Annex
  I countries (OECD, 1997). </p>
<p>Transport activities, and thus carbon emissions, because of the almost total
  dependence (about 97%) on petroleum-based fuels, have been growing dramatically
  since 1950. This is mainly due to decline in relative travel cost while at the
  same time incomes were rising. The dominant source of these carbon emissions
  is road travel. Vehicle ownership rose from 50 million in 1950 to 770 million
  in 1997, of which 78% were cars (Philpott, 1997). Vehicles on the road are estimated
  to rise by 50 million annually leading to a billion of them within 12-15 years
  time without direct intervention (UNEP, 1998). This growth varies among the
  different regions of the world. The industrialised regions with 21% of global
  population have 60% and 80% of commercial and passenger vehicles, while developing
  countries with 79% of the world's population have 40 and 20% respectively (Hilling,
  1996). This disparity has a clear impact on their transport-related carbon emissions
  as shown in Table.8.1. Since 1970, phenomenal growth in private vehicle ownership
  is occurring worldwide as income rises; this is shown for cities of selected
  countries in <a href="fig881.htm">Figure 8.1</a>. This brings about a modal
  shift in passenger transport as can be seen for EU countries in <a href="fig882.htm">Figure
  8.2</a>. Similarly, freight travel by road is growing faster than other modes
  with a significant shift from rail to road. These changes are shown in <a href="fig883.htm">Figure
  8.3</a> for European Union (EUROSTAT, 1997). Air travel has been growing faster
  than road travel. Between 1960 and 1990, air travel (passenger-km) grew by 9.5%
  annually and airfreight by a faster rate of 11.7% annually (ICAO, 1992). Though
  in recent times the overall annual growth has been about 5-6% and there has
  been reduction in energy intensity, this growth still surpasses economic growth.
  Controlling emissions from aviation is proving difficult. </p>

<p>Emissions from rail transport have been declining mainly due to shifts in fuel
  use and modal changes in the overall activities in the transport sector. Fuel
  changes, mostly from coal to electricity and diesel, have had a significant
  impact on reducing carbon emissions. However, if emissions from the primary
  energy source of electricity are included, there may not be gains from electrified
  rail systems. Marine transport activities have been increasing steadily because
  they are dependent on world trade patterns. These activities declined in the
  late 1970s till the 1980s, but grew in the late 1980s due to the economic upturn
  in Asia, and then declined again as result of recession in that region. Emissions
  from shipping transport have followed this pattern, though not exactly because
  goods are now being moved in larger and more efficient marine vessels, especially
  dry bulk goods that form 60-70% of such movements (Michaelis, 1996). </p>
<p>Generally, growth in transport related emissions, especially from motorisation,
  has resulted in serious local and global environmental problems. Emissions from
  petroleum fuels are carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO<span class="subscript">2</span>),
  hydrocarbons (HC), sulphur oxides (SO<span class="subscript">x</span>), nitrogen oxides (NO<span class="subscript">x</span>) and particulate
  matter (PM), and many secondary pollutants such as ozone and peroxyacetyl nitrates,
  and lead (Pb) from leaded fuels (Faiz et al., 1996). Many of these are hazardous
  to human health as irritants, allergens or carcinogens causing local problems
  especially for children. On a regional scale, SO<span class="subscript">x</span> and NO<span class="subscript">x</span> can cause air, water
  and land contamination; and globally, CO<span class="subscript">2</span> contributes
  to global warming (Walsh, 1997). In addition, growing road congestion in large
  cities worldwide is causing local pollution leading to high </p>

<p>economic and social costs. The example of Santiago, Chile in which the children
  tend to have 25% higher incidence of coughing than those in other Chilean cities
  illustrates this (WRI et al., 1996). Stopping and starting of engines in congested
  traffic consumes more than three times more fuel than free-flowing traffic (Jourmad
  et al, 1990). Emissions from aircraft engines can be severe, especially CO<span class="subscript">2</span>,
  which has the same effect as that at ground level, while the effects of other
  gases may be affected by height (Michaelis, 1996). </p>
<p>Transport related carbon emissions would grow significantly unless there is
  a major change in lifestyle and travel behaviour. It has been predicted that
  global transport energy use and, thus, GHG emissions (due to their linkage with
  petroleum fuels) will grow by 2.2-2.6% yearly from 1993 to 2010 (OECD, 1996).
  Also, since 1971 the transport share of total petroleum consumption has been
  rising steadily, and will grow from 55.6% in 1993 to 60% in 2010 if energy use
  continue to grow by 2.6% as it did between 1971 to 1993 (Wohlgemuth, 1997).
  GHG emissions from this growth will be substantial, and expected gains in vehicle
  fuel economy is estimated as 1 to 2% per annum based on historical trends and
  expected technical changes (Grubler et al., 1993; IEA, 1993, Greene and Duleep,
  1993; DeCicco and Ross, 1993; Walsh, 1993). The major share of the growth is
  expected from private road transportation. Also, road transport of freight is
  expected to continue to dominate freight travel, as goods become lighter. The
  overall expected growth in transport related GHG emissions will be huge, and
  reducing it to meet the demands of the climate convention will require major
  changes because of the limits of technology changes. OECD estimated that projected
  technology improvements would only meet half of the effort required to achieve
  the demands of the UNFCCC (OECD, 1995, OECD 1997). Coping with expected transport
  growth is a challenge for the transport sector.</p>
<p>However, a number of policies and measures exist which if used while recognising
  local specificities could reduce transport related GHG emissions (IPCC, 1996).
  Similarly, good management practices are available which can moderate the growth
  in aviation fuel consumption and so reduce GHG emissions. These policies and
  measures could be transferred between and across regions if certain implementing
  barriers can be overcome. This chapter will concentrate on looking at the potential
  to transfer some of these options within and between countries. The chapter
  will largely be based on road transport due to its dominance in current and
  future GHG emissions in the transport sector.</p>
