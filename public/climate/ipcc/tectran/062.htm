<h3>4.4.6 Participation and Climate-Relevant Technology Transfer: Current discussions</h3>
<p>
  Participatory development is now widely recognised as a way of achieving technology
  transfer at all levels of development endeavour. This has grown from a perceived
  need to move from donor driven technology transfer to national needs driven
  approaches. However, such a shift in approach is hampered by a lack of international
  consensus on what actions any particular country should take; how the international
  community should share the task of providing the resources for such actions;
  and, the disconnection in some developing countries between domestic politics
  and their stance in international fora. There is also a second bottleneck: the
  gap that exists between international agreement and domestic consensus in developing
  countries that is meant to follow international agreement (Gupta, 1997). Various
  of the work tasks initiated by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological
  Advice (SBSTA) reflect the perceived need of developing country Parties to benefit
  from capacity building so they are better able to identify their needs for technology
  transfer (for example, FCCC/SBSTA/1998/INF2, INF.5). In some ways the Technology
  Cooperation Agreements of the IEA are an attempt to build collaborative working
  relationships through a participatory forum of all significant actors with a
  role in technology cooperation activities relevant to the application of ESTs
  in a particular country (OECD, 1998b).<br>
  <br>
  It has been suggested that if the FCCC wants to generate broader support, it
  may need to assist the Governments of developing countries to widen the base
  of domestic consensus among national stakeholders, investigating and responding
  to their needs (Van Berkel et al., 1997). To help address the challenges, countries
  are encouraged to engage organised stakeholders representing different societal
  interests for the priority sectors into a capacity building process. Three &quot;pillars&quot;
  are proposed: creating an enabling environment for stakeholders' participation;
  implementing and evaluating mitigation and adaptation actions; and assessing
  mitigation and adaptation needs and opportunities. These all link to a roundtable
  process which engages stakeholders who represent different societal interests
  to produce and implement, in an organised way, a prioritised national action
  plan with wide buy-in (Van Berkel and Arkesteijn, 1998). then propose that assistance
  is required for the organisation and facilitation of the participatory process
  that will result in sound proposals for climate relevant technology transfer
  and collaboration. </p>
