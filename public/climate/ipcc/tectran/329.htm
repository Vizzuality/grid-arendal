<p><b>Summary</b><br>
  The Kenya Ceramic Stove, or Jiko (KCJ), is a charcoal-burning stove that is 
  roughly 30% efficient, and if used properly can save 20 - 50% in fuel consumption 
  over simple 'unimproved' stoves or a traditional three-stone fire (Walubengo, 
  1995). The KCJ was developed after study of a Thai 'bucket' stove that was examined 
  partially through a 'South-South' dialog over stove characteristics and design.</p>
<p>The KCJ is a portable improved charcoal burning stove consisting of an hour-glass 
  shaped metal cladding with an interior ceramic liner that is perforated to permit 
  the ash to fall to the collection cavity at the base. A single pot is placed 
  on the top of the stove. There are now more than 200 businesses, artisans, and 
  micro-enterprise or informal sector manufacturers producing over 13,000 stoves 
  each month. There are over 700,000 KCJ's in use in Kenya (Walubengo, 1995). 
  The KCJ is found in over 50% of all urban homes, and roughly 16% of rural homes. 
  Stove models adapted from the KCJ are now being disseminated in many countries 
  across Africa, and wood-burning variants are being introduced and promoted in 
  rural areas as well. </p>
<p>The fuel savings of the KCJ have important economic benefits to the users, 
  who in some cases devote a quarter of family income to charcoal purchases (Kammen, 
  1995). The stoves can also reduce the pollution exposure of families using the 
  stove (see also <a href="274.htm#b141">Box 14.1</a>). The WHO reports that more 
  than two million premature deaths per year can be attributed globally to the 
  indoor air pollution caused by household solid fuels. Reducing the harmful products 
  of incomplete combustion produced by household stoves is an important benefit 
  from the development of cleaner cookstoves.</p>
<p><b>Approach</b><br>
  The KCJ is the result of research on stove design, efficiency, and patterns 
  of usage initiated in the 1970's and actively continued through the 1980s (Barnes 
  et al., 1994; Kammen, 1995). A single private sector company, Jerri International, 
  served as the initial manufacturer of the KCJ. </p>
<p>Since 1982 the Kenya Energy and Environment Organisation (KENGO) has organised 
  promotion and outreach efforts to encourage the use of the KCJ. A number of 
  NGOs and national development agencies have played important roles in the evolution 
  of the stove and the stove dissemination process, and have worked both within 
  Kenya and across sub-Saharan Africa to promote the manufacture and sales of 
  the KCJ through a network of informal-sector stove entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>A decision was made not to directly subsidise commercial stove production and 
  dissemination. Initially stoves were expensive (~ US$ 15/stove) sales were slow, 
  and quality control has been a significant problem. Continued research and refinement 
  and expanded numbers and types of manufacturers and vendors increased competition, 
  and spurred innovations in materials used and in production methods. The KCJ 
  can now be purchased in a variety of sizes and styles. Prices for KCJ models 
  have decreased to roughly US$ 1 - 3 (Walubengo, 1995). This decrease is consistent 
  with the 'learning curve' theory of price reductions through innovations that 
  result from experience gained in the manufacturing, distribution, marketing 
  and sales process. Two architects of the stove programme received an international 
  award for their work, which is an important recognition for the need for research 
  on often unheralded but important technologies.</p>
<p>The ceramic liner of the KCJ degrades over time, and needs to be replaced. 
  Street vendors of stoves, and many of the larger stove sales outlets take 'used' 
  stoves back, discounting the purchase of a new stove. The liners of the old 
  stove are then removed, the metal cladding is repaired, if needed, and the stove 
  is reassembled, repainted, and resold. This process has also served to foster 
  wider informal sector stove economy.</p>
<p><b>Impacts</b><br>
  The KCJ can reduce fuel use by 30 - 50%, although charcoal production itself 
  can have significant environmental impacts, and the attractiveness of the KCJ 
  may have increased this demand. The KCJ also reduces emissions of trace gases 
  and particulate matter, which contributes to acute respiratory infection, the 
  leading cause of illness in developing nations. Reported levels of emissions 
  reductions from KCJ range up to 50%, although this is a subject of ongoing research 
  (Barnes et al., 1994). The KCJ and the dissemination process used in Kenya has 
  now been widely disseminated (and adapted) across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b><br>
  While avoiding direct subsidies, a number of organisations provide training, 
  outreach services, publicity, and logistical support for the local commercial 
  industry. This 'soft' subsidy can be particularly effective in facilitating 
  the development and acceptance of a new technology without introducing the price 
  distortions that can be associated with some forms of subsidy.</p>
<p>The lessons for international involvement that can be drawn from the KCJ case 
  include:</p>
<p>Support for research both within developing nations and for research collaborations 
  between developing nations can lead to significant innovations in the performance 
  and commercialisation of what had been regarded by many as a simple and mature 
  technology.</p>
<p>Extended, stable, programme support is invaluable while short-lived, episodic 
  funding can lead to waste and inefficiency. There are significant technical, 
  social, cultural and economic questions that must be addressed even for technologies 
  that may appear simple. </p>
<p>Support for stove programmes need not take the form of direct subsidies. Partnerships 
  between institutional groups, including NGOs and international organisations, 
  involved in R&amp;D, promotion, and training can support commercial producers 
  and sellers if the mechanisms for feedback and cooperation are planned and developed.</p>
