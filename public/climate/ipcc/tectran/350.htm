<h1>Case Study 22</h1>
<p> <b>World Bank/GEF India Alternative Energy Project</b><br>

  <br>
  <b>Summary</b><br>
  A multilateral development project helped catalyse important technology transfers
  and market changes for wind power and solar photovoltaic systems in India. Tax
  incentives, capacity building, and new market delivery mechanisms promoted private-sector
  activity. In just a few years, 968 MW of wind farms were installed and operating
  in India, almost all commercial and privately operated. The wind industry jumped
  from three companies to 26, many of them joint ventures. Technology development
  and exports accelerated and costs declined.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Background</b><br>
  The India Alternate Energy project was started in 1991 by the World Bank and
  Global Environment Facility (GEF) to promote commercialisation of wind power
  and solar PV technologies in India. The project was designed to support existing
  government policies to promote wind power through special tax incentives.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Approach</b><br>
  The project was designed to pioneer financing and market delivery mechanisms
  based on private-sector intermediaries and suitable incentive schemes and policies
  for small independent power producers. Markets for these technologies were catalysed
  through large-scale demonstration, increased consumer confidence, and enhanced
  willingness to pay. The project strengthened the capabilities of the India Renewable
  Energy Development Agency (IREDA) to promote and finance private-sector investments,
  and channelled financing through that agency. One component of the project directly
  financed wind farm installations by private-sector developers, with a target
  of 85MW to be financed through the GEF and the International Development Association
  (IDA), and with co-financing from the Danish government and from other resources
  mobilised by IREDA. A second component provided a marketing campaign, credit
  facilities, and subsidies to rural consumers for purchasing solar PV systems.
  The project targeted 2.5 to 3.0 MWp of solar PV. The project also supported
  policies that encourage small-scale independent power producers to invest in
  wind farms and mini-hydro installations. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Impacts</b><br>
  By 1998, over 270 MW of wind power had been financed by IREDA and commissioned,
  including 41 MW commissioned with GEF and IDA financing and 10 MW commissioned
  with Danish funds. Only 0.3 MWp of PV had been commissioned, but an additional
  1.0 MWp was being prepared. In parallel with these direct project impacts, a
  total of 968 MW of wind farms were installed and operating, of which 917 MW
  were commercial and privately operated. Highly favourable investment tax policies
  strongly influenced these commercial installations. New suppliers entered the
  wind power and solar PV markets. Before the project there were three major companies
  involved in the wind industry, but by 1998 as many as 26 companies were engaged
  in the wind turbine manufacturing industry, many with foreign partners. High-technology
  wind turbine designs up to 600-kW with variable speed operation were produced
  by 14 companies. Domestic production of blades began, and exports of blades
  and synchronous generators to Europe was underway. Wind turbine exports to other
  countries also began. The installed costs of wind turbines in India declined.
  Domestic production capacity for solar modules went from 3 MWp in 1991 to 8
  MWp by 1996, and the number of companies involved in the PV industry went from
  16 in 1991 to more than 70 in 1998.<br>
  <br>
  The World Bank/GEF project indirectly helped catalyse these market changes and
  technology transfers by helping to raise awareness among investors and banking
  institutions on the viability of wind power technology and lobbying for lower
  import tariffs for both wind and solar PV systems. Many more financial institutions
  decided to offer financing for wind farms, and a wind-power loan portfolio among
  commercial banking institutions emerged (this was a key project goal). The number
  of Indian consultants capable of developing wind power investment projects increased
  dramatically, in part because of GEF-supported training and networking activities
  for consultants, technicians and private firms (a roster of consultants was
  available from IREDA for reference by investors). Promotional efforts and numerous
  business meetings organised by IREDA increased awareness of various PV applications
  among potential users. <br>
  <br>
  <b> Lessons Learned</b><br>
  Investment tax credits appear to be a powerful stimulus to technology transfer
  and market development, and have had a huge impact in a very short time. However,
  the sustainability and viability of the markets and joint ventures is uncertain
  if the credits are removed.<br>
  <br>
  There have been problems in extending credit to potential rural PV consumers.
  Evidence suggests that financial institutions perceive rural consumers as unwilling
  to repay loans and therefore have not extended credit. Also, the lack of infrastructure
  for after-sales support and service has emerged as an additional difficulty
  in rural markets.<br>
