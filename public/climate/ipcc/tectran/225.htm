<h3>11.5.3 Programmes, Policies and other Interventions for Technology Transfer
  between Countries</h3>
<p>
  Agricultural development has been strongly influenced by technology. New technology
  has been the most consistent driving force behind agricultural growth. Evenson
  (1994) estimates that it has contributed from one-half to two-thirds of output
  gains over recent decades. Thus, strengthening agricultural technology transfer
  between countries will have significant impact on the improvement of production
  capability, increased food variety, quality, and security, as well as balanced
  agricultural development, resource utilisation and conservation.<br>
  <i><br>
  Technology transfer between developed and developing countries</i><br>
  The flow of technology transfer in the agricultural sector from developed to
  developing countries dealing with climate change is going to be crucial as the
  majority of the climate mitigation and adaptation projects are going to be funded
  by investors, bilateral and multilateral assistance agencies, NGOs and foundations,
  largely based in developed countries. <br>
  <br>
  <i>Role of Governments </i><br>
  Governments are going to have an important function in the selection and adoption
  of mitigation and adaptation technologies in the agricultural sector. Governments
  can promote effective modalities for the access and transfer, in particular
  to developing countries, of ESTs by means of activities mentioned in Chapter
  34 of Agenda 21 and decisions of the CoPs (see also <a href="037.htm">Section
  3.3.1</a> in <a href="033.htm">Chapter 3</a> on Agenda 21). Some of the possible
  measures for the governments are to: (i) increase funding to mitigation and
  adaptation projects and to programmes on: preventing land degradation, improving
  water use efficiency, breeding new varieties and manufacturing agrochemicals
  to mitigate and adapt to climate change; (ii) increase funding for improving
  the capacity to develop and manage EST; (iii) increase funding for institution
  and human capacity building and for improving R&amp;D capabilities in developing
  countries; (iv) facilitate adaptation by farmers by providing incentives, by
  regulation and by improving existing or setting up new institutions; (v) promote
  research and development activities directed at technological innovation and
  technology transfer for climate-change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture;
  (vi) develop national agricultural information systems to produce reports on
  state-of-the-art technology, disseminate information on available technologies,
  their sources, their environmental risk and help users to identify their needs;
  and, (vii) purchase patent and licenses on commercial terms for their transfer
  to developing countries on non-commercial terms as part of development cooperation
  for sustainable development.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Role of International organisations </i><br>
  International organisations could (i) increase funding for institutional and
  human capacity building, and for improving R&amp;D capabilities in developing
  countries to implement the UNFCCC; (ii) provide new and additional grant and
  concessional funding to meet the agreed incremental costs of projects to achieve
  agreed global environmental benefits in climate change; (iii) increase funding
  to agricultural sector projects and programmes to mitigate and adapt to climate
  change; (vi) develop regional and international agricultural information systems
  to collect and report the state-of-the-art technologies, disseminate the information
  on available technologies and relevant information and help users to identify
  their needs; and, (vii) support central laboratories to do analytical work for
  developing countries, providing uniform methods and equipment and producing
  comparable results (as originally planned for soil and plant analysis at the
  IBSRAM in Bangkok). <br>

      <p>In the Research Programme on Methane Emissions from Rice Fields funded
	by GEF in 1993, training has been provided to the country teams working
	on the ALGAS project. In the ALGAS project, capacity has been raised through
	training over 160 national technical experts in elements of GHG inventory,
	mitigation and project identification. These experts are now providing
	input to the process of national communications and helping identify other
	climate change mitigation projects for future development.</p>

<p> <i>Role of Private sector </i><br>
  Technology generation is shared between the public and the private sectors,
  with the share of the private sector tending to be greater in more developed
  countries. Private research is attracted to subsectors where markets for research
  results exist and can be privately appropriated. Therefore, the private sector
  is going to play a critical role in the agricultural sector to deal with climate
  change. Some of the measures for the private sector to promote technology transfer
  could be to: (i) provide technical assistance to appropriate users on its new
  technologies or new varieties; (ii) promote cooperation on research and development
  activities directed at technological innovation and technology transfer for
  climate-change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture.<br>
  <i><br>
  Technology transfer among developing countries</i><br>
  Technology transfers among developing countries are limited, because most advanced
  technologies are developed and owned by industrialised countries. In technology
  transfer between developing countries, finance can become an issue. For example,
  the technology transfer of small scale biogas digesters is mainly from developing
  country to developing country and it is limited by financial problems. Thus,
  if the technology is transferred from one developing country to other developing
  countries, both provider and recipient may need new and additional financial
  resources from international organisations or developed countries. Therefore,
  international organisations and developed countries could (i) increase funding
  for institutional and human capacity building and for improving R&amp;D capabilities
  in developing countries; (ii) fund both the technology provider and technology
  recipient to promote a successful technology transfer; (iii) facilitate adaptation
  by farmers by providing incentives, by regulation and by improving existing
  or setting up new institutions. See <a href="225.htm#b119">Box 11.9</a>.<br>

      <p>The Asia-Pacific Region Biogas Research and Training Center (BRTC) has
	been contributing a lot to promote the development of biogas digester
	technology in developing countries. Since it was established, the BRTC
	has held 21 training workshops with more than 270 participants coming
	from 71 countries. Most participants of the programme acquired the skills
	to construct, operate and maintain small scale biogas digesters in their
	countries. The center proved to be a valuable tool in demonstrating the
	usefulness of capacity building in transferring a technology. During the
	period 1980 to 1990, more than 50 scientists were sent out to assist the
	construction of over 70 digesters in 22 developing countries. Biogas digester
	use has been expanded in the developing countries located in Asian, Pacific
	and African regions. This technology has provided clean and convenient
	energy for farmers. The diffusion of this technology is limited by financial
	assistance. New and additional financial resources for both providers
	and receivers of developing countries are expected to enhance the benefit
	practices for abatement of GHG (Yizhang, 1990; Zhao, 1990).</p>

<p>
  In order to improve/stimulate technology transfer in agriculture, a multi-level
  technology transfer system (global, regional, and national) can be established.
  The global system may be made up of three major players: NARSs of developing
  countries, IARCs, and advanced laboratories and institutions in developed countries.
  All of them play common and different roles within government efforts to support
  technology transfer for climate change.</p>
