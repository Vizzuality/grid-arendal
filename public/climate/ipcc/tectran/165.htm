<h3>8.5.2 Policies and Programmes for Technology Transfer between Countries </h3>
<p>Creating an enabling business environment and building suitable indigenous
  technological capability in technology recipient countries, and creating the
  enabling environment for stimulating technology outflows are basic to transport
  technology transfer. Hence, these are briefly commented on in the following
  two paragraphs before continuing with a description of specific technology transfer
  policies and measures. </p>
<p>Building the necessary human resource for technology transfer and development
  is important to the transfer process, and this may involve programmes and policies
  for an adequate S&amp;T human resource base, promotion of general S&amp;T literacy,
  ensuring active participation of the indigenous S&amp;T community and utilising
  local materials and other resources. A modern computerised system for information
  storage, retrieval and use with linkages to relevant national and global systems
  is very important. Equally important is a well-organised and co-ordinated institutional
  framework performing functions ranging from regulating, skill development, information
  development and dissemination, and to financial management. Suitable legislation
  for technology imports (choice, selection, evaluation and monitoring), foreign
  investments, and project assessment, approval and monitoring are needed, as
  well as institutions for law enforcement and arbitration (Davidson, 1998). </p>
<p>Creating a favourable business environment is important in addition to a stable
  macro-economy for technology flows. This includes having clear and well-defined
  operating guidelines for business operations, organised financial institutions,
  market information development and dissemination, and support training programmes
  and associated technologies. These capacities will not only enhance the absorption
  of technologies being transferred, but create the capacity for generating new
  technologies and so offer new transfer opportunities. As an example, these capacities
  were crucial in the transfer of technologies to the Asian countries, which have
  enjoyed significant economic progress recently (World Bank, 1996).</p>
<p>Stimulating technology flows from technology supplier countries is needed for
  the transfer of transport technologies. This will require instituting certain
  measures such as informing local companies about potential markets, financial
  support for joint ventures with companies in recipient countries, grants for
  investments with transfer-of-transport options, preferential treatment to firms
  that transfer and sponsor expertise to live and work with recipients. In addition,
  supplier countries should ensure that options for transfer have been adequately
  tested domestically to build the confidence and respect of the recipient (UNCTAD,
  1999). </p>
<p>An important specific policy for technology transfer is the will and commitment
  of governments involved in the transfer and development of transport technology.
  This was the most single important factor for the success of technology transfer
  of the automobile industry in South Korea as shown in <a href="165.htm#t86">Table
  8.6</a> (Pacudan, 1998). This commitment can be from the highest possible authority
  and be demonstrated by long-term strategic plans of technology growth, while
  linking it to other development policies and programmes. </p>

<p>Another specific policy is the promotion of R&amp;D in the transport sector.
  Globally, industrial R&amp;D in the transport sector have undergone major changes
  in the last two decades. First, there has been a substantial increase in R&amp;D
  funds by vehicle manufacturers in industrialised countries, especially in the
  US, Europe and Japan; second, a change in direction and scope of R&amp;D funding;
  and third, a change in the management and organisation (Gerybadze, 1994). R&amp;D
  management has changed from centralisation with no explicit strategies in the
  1970s, to project planning, strategic management and decentralisation in the
  1980s, and now to integration of R&amp;D strategy to corporate strategy, balancing
  between basic and applied research programmes within networks. Governments can
  institute new policies and programmes to exploit these changes, because despite
  production still being concentrated in a few companies, opportunities exist
  for technology recipients with vehicle assembly plants to encourage joint R&amp;D
  activities with the main firms. The case of increased imports of cars produced
  in Mexico by the U.S. automobile manufacturers illustrates this point. During
  the devaluation of the Mexican peso, U.S. companies easily imported high quality
  produced cars from Mexico back to the U.S. for distribution because they were
  cheaper. It shows the importance of building capabilities in recipient countries.
  Another aspect of R&amp;D programmes is to enhance local R&amp;D through promotion
  of contract R&amp;D programmes between public and private sectors within and
  between countries. This can promote relevance and stimulate interest in local
  R&amp;D, as has been the case of Malaysia where companies have been able to
  receive a 200% tax exemption for R&amp;D expenditure (Idrus, 1988). Setting
  up a revolving fund for R&amp;D promotion and commercialisation of results as
  being done in countries such as South Korea and Japan can help to promote R&amp;D.
  Due to the rapidity in innovations, and the expensive and skill demanding nature
  of modern R&amp;D globally, countries need to participate in international and
  regional R&amp;D networks. Joint R&amp;D will allow technology recipient countries
  access to very expensive equipment, laboratories, and high quality skills, which
  are normally absent in many technology recipient countries.</p>
<p>In general, technology co-operative agreements among firms can form a very
  good basis for the transfer of transport technologies. Joint ventures in equity
  and no-equity firms offer opportunities for technology transfer. In equity form,
  the recipient will be fully involved in decision-making in the capitalisation
  of technology, royalty fees and organisational arrangements, and depending on
  the capability of the recipient, significant technical skills such as procurement
  of equipment, R&amp;D, quality control and marketing skills can be transferred
  through joint programmes. Joint R&amp;D programmes could be an efficient means
  of transferring knowledge and stimulating activities especially among resource-constrained
  countries. Financial, marketing and management cooperation agreements can be
  used to access technology through non-equity joint ventures. The use of joint
  agreements in other forms can be used effectively to promote information access
  and exchange. However, in joint agreements, partners need to be prepared to
  share the risks and costs of programmes. These agreements could be used to stimulate
  the transfer of smaller and fuel-efficient cars between parent and subsidiary
  firms, hence encouraging transfer between countries.</p>
<p>Bilateral co-operative agreements between countries which could lead to twining
  or linking of cities can provide opportunities for cities with successful urban
  planning systems that had yielded GHG benefits to transfer such experiences
  to other cities. Exchange of personnel, targeted visits, joint implementation
  of programmes are some of activities which could result in the transfer of skills
  and knowledge (Figueroa et al, 1998). &quot;Integrated transport planning&quot;
  which involves a set of policies that matches the environmental and transport
  agendas using experiences worldwide can improve the local and global environment
  of many cities. This can include the harmonisation of a wide range of policy
  objectives such as wider use of public transport, new road infrastructures,
  pricing policies, and environmental quality monitoring (IIEC, 1996). </p>
<p>Technical assistance programmes can offer technology recipient countries opportunity
  to access specific skills such as technical advice on operation, maintenance,
  and quality control, but not proprietary technical information. Consultancy
  services can be used to transfer specific technical skills. Management contracts
  could be used to acquire selected skills such as organisational and technology-sourcing
  skills, but problems could arise from different perceptions of project objectives
  between the two parties, unnecessary extension of contracts, and level of involvement
  of indigenous employees. <br>
  <br>
  Promotion of standards and regulations can significantly be used to control
  emissions, especially from road vehicles as was demonstrated in the USA with
  the 'Clean Air Act'. Nearly all countries have standards for vehicle emissions,
  but many technology recipient countries have weak enforcement mechanisms, hence
  compliance is generally weak. Applying standards depends on several factors
  such as the manufacturing base of the country, capacity to enforce the standards
  and facilities to comply with the standards. Using similar standards in countries
  with assembly plants as those of the parent companies will ensure that updated
  technology will be transferred between both countries. Countries without manufacturing
  capacities can institute strict standards, but they need to have the capacity
  to enforce them such as testing and inspection facilities. Strict standards
  can also be used to control second-hand imports. </p>
<p>Policies that can promote local technology development if the basic technical
  capacities are present include discouraging imports of completely built up units,
  providing incentives to local assemblers to increase local content in production
  (tax reduction, subsidies), and regulations to ensure local content in varying
  percentages. These policies, which were instituted in the development of automobile
  manufacture in South Korea, can provide significant lessons for technology recipient
  countries in the acquisition of many GHG reduction options in the transport
  sector (see <a href="165.htm#t86">Table 8.6</a>). Some countries have embarked
  on national programmes for transport technology development, though most of
  them are for automobile promotion as was the case of South Korea and India.
  More recently, some African countries are doing the same. Nigeria and Kenya
  are examples of such moves. In the case of Nigeria the prototype has been demonstrated,
  while in the case of Kenya the prototype is yet to be adequately tested.</p>
<p>Policies and measures to promote non-motorised systems mainly involve the construction
  of the associated infrastructure such as dedicated lanes with the supporting
  signalling systems, and parking facilities for cycles. Creating local manufacturing
  facilities for bicycles to increase public access will be useful to improve
  their use by poorer members of the society. On the whole, these policies and
  measures should be integrated into the overall transport policy, as has been
  done in some European cities. </p>
<p>Multilateral agencies can be useful in facilitating the transfer of transport
  technologies through provision of specific information, support for local information
  networks, provision of technical advice and providing training programmes. Also,
  these organisations can be used to provide unbiased information regarding technology
  products and services. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) that is concerned
  with providing funds for abating GHG emissions will hopefully approve a transport
  programme soon that is aimed at funding non-motorised transport, modal shifts,
  electric and hybrid vehicles, and biomass transport fuel. GEF is expected to
  be restructured to include support for technology transfer activities (GEF,
  1999). </p>
