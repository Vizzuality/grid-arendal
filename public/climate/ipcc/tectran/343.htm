  <b>Summary</b><br>
  This industrial sector case study is on the technology for energy saving in 
  steel manufacturing, transferred from Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC) to steel 
  industries in the Peoples Republic of China (P.R. China). This project was a 
  part of the Green Aid Plan proposed by the Ministry of International Trade and 
  Industry (MITI), Japan for energy saving and environmental protection in P.R. 
  China. Two examples of actual technology transfer projects illustrate the barriers 
  encountered and countermeasures for overcoming them. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background</b><br>
  In the Peoples Republic of China, roughly three quarters of the energy consumed 
  comes from coal. The total amount of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emitted in P.R. China is the second 
  highest in the world. P.R. China produces the largest amount of crude steel 
  in the world. But the specific energy consumption for producing each tonne of 
  crude steel is higher than that of some developed countries such as Japan and 
  the US. Japan had achieved a 20% reduction in energy consumption through technology 
  upgrades as early as 1993. Japan supplies steel products to both international 
  and domestic markets with the lowest energy consumption. As a part of the Green 
  Aid Plan to promote energy savings and environmental protection in China, MITI 
  in Japan launched the &quot;Japan - China model project for blast furnace, hot 
  stove, waste heat recovery.&quot; <br>
  <b><br>
  Approach</b><br>
  The project, located in Laiwu, demonstrates and disseminates the blast furnace 
  hot stove waste heat recovery technology. The operation of the equipment started 
  in October 1995. The waste heat in the exhaust gas, at a temperature from 200 
  to 300oC, was recovered and used efficiently to preheat the combustion air and 
  the fuel gas by adopting an organic oil as a heating medium. This process technology 
  can be applied to existing hot stoves of blast furnaces, because the heat exchangers 
  are separately installed and connected with the transfer lines where the hot 
  oil is circulated by pumps. As a result, the operating index has been improved 
  significantly, reducing the fuel ratio of blast furnaces by approximately 7%. 
  Further studies in this area were done for diffusing this technology within 
  P.R. China. For successful implementation, the operating skills were developed 
  under a set of training courses for operators using the actual equipment used 
  in Japan. Through this training, the operators could get information related 
  to both operation and improvement techniques. Japanese engineers were also sent 
  to the site for the further transfer of related information.<br>
  <b><br>
  Impacts</b><br>
  Incentives and benefits applied to both NSC and P.R. China. NSC profited through 
  technology upgrade. For P.R. China, facing increasingly competitive international 
  and domestic markets, being able to reduce the cost of steel produced by saving 
  energy while reducing GHG emissions is a positive development . There were certain 
  barriers associated with technology transfer, such as the import of equipment 
  components. It will be beneficial for them to be locally made to cut down the 
  costs. However, these parts purchased domestically could cause some reliability 
  problems.<br>
  <b><br>
  Lessons Learned</b><br>
  Maintenance technology is also essential for sound operation. It is important 
  to transfer not only maintenance procedure manuals, but also maintenance skills 
  by providing actual training on-site. For most developing countries, indigenous 
  availability of parts appears to be critical for economic viability and sustainable 
  development.</p>
