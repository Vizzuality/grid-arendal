<h1>13.5 Enhanced Technology Transfer between Countries</h1>
<p> Expanding technology transfer between countries will require addressing many
  of the same barriers and undertaking activities similar to those discussed in
  the previous section. Many of these activities will occur between governments,
  although involving the private sector and community groups is important for
  success. In the waste management sector, there are opportunities for North-North,
  North-South and South-South bilateral cooperation. In fact, government-to-government
  South-South exchanges are likely to be particularly valuable, because these
  countries confront different waste management issues than developed countries
  and may gain valuable insights from working together. Moreover, information
  should also flow from the South to the North, since many developing countries
  are implementing alternative waste management strategies with untapped potential
  in developed countries. <br>
  <br>
  Traditionally, national government agencies have been the primary actors for
  donor countries, although some municipalities have developed partnerships (such
  as sister city or &quot;twinning&quot; relationships). Some of these community-based
  programmes directly promote mitigation technologies, such as the Cities for
  Climate Protection Campaign. To date, more than 180 cities worldwide have committed
  to reduce their GHG impacts as part of the programme, and almost one-quarter
  of the proposed activities will address GHG emissions from waste management
  (ICLEI, 1997). Where national governments take the lead in organising or funding
  bilateral activities, municipal governments on both sides should be involved
  since agencies at these levels are frequently responsible for basic waste management
  services. Efforts should also be made to involve the community that will be
  directly affected by the project from the earliest stages of its development.
