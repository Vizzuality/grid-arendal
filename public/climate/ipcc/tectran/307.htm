<h3>15.5.5 Enabling Policies, Programmes and Measures</h3>
<p> <br>
  Acceleration of coastal-adaptation technology transfer across organisational
  boundaries requires actions at all levels of the process by all stakeholders.
  Of the newer institutional developments evolving, the best will be those that
  are effective in fostering corporate and community collaborative efforts, while
  nurturing positive government-academic-business relationships (Kozmetsky, 1990;
  see also <a href="051.htm">Chapter 4</a> on enabling environment). Common elements
  of these new policies, programmes and measures include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> New governmental technology policies that provide increased support for
    helping users to obtain adjust and use technology. This includes major investments
    in information infrastructure, in training and education of the workforce
    and in outreach and extension services (Brooks, 1993). For example, the U.S.
    NOAA Coastal Services Center produces environmental data sets and information
    products for coastal managers, provides access to information clearinghouses
    for coastal scientists, managers and the public, and conducts technical training
    for coastal planners and managers.</li>
  <li> Decisions on technology activities at the national level that are increasingly
    made in collaboration with other levels of government and private-sector users.
    This may be accomplished by government-sponsored needs assessments (e.g.,
    via surveys, stakeholder meetings and workshops). However, it implies that
    focal points must exist and be well sited within the national government to
    be able to input user needs and capabilities into the decision process.</li>
  <li> Research universities that are becoming more deeply engaged in applied
    R&amp;D, and are expanding ways for accelerating technology diffusion to users
    at all levels of government and the private sector. Mechanisms that have proven
    to be effective include extension services, such as training and guidance
    provided by sea-grant colleges in the United States and joint university-business
    research parks to promote collective R&amp;D.</li>
  <li> New business alliances with government collaborators to leverage resources
    and capabilities. These could include joint projects with consortia of business,
    such as those fostered by the Danish Hydraulic Institute.</li>
  <li> Increased involvement of NGOs and trainers who have a sound grasp of social
    methodology, understand the concerns of target groups and are able to devise
    the most appropriate means for conveying information at the grassroots level.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Other powerful mechanisms to facilitate successful coastal adaptation and technology
  transfer are regulation, standards and insurance. For example, the Coastal Barrier
  Resources Act in the United States provides protection to coastal barriers by
  prohibiting most expenditures of federal funds in these areas, thus strongly
  discouraging development. Insurance can have a similar role, although it may
  also stimulate maladaptive practices (<a href="307.htm#b153">Box 15.3</a>). Building codes and standards
  are covered in <a href="127.htm">Chapter 7</a>, while international performance
  standards are discussed in <a href="313.htm">Section 15.6.5</a>.</p>

    <td> In countries with climate-related insurance markets, insurance can have
      a positive or a negative role in promoting adaptation to climate change
      and any associated technology transfer (Clark, 1998). This may happen directly
      via contacts with customers or indirectly as the insurance industry lobbies
      institutions. Technology underpins this interaction as improving data management
      and modelling capability give the insurance industry more detailed information
      of both the risks and opportunities that climate variability and change
      present (Crichton and Mounsey, 1997). However, as Clark (1998) argued, more
      knowledge may benefit the insurance industry, but it does not necessarily
      lead to overall societal benefits. Determining if insurance is acting in
      a negative or positive role will depend on the assessment criteria and is
      linked with the issue of distinguishing adaptation from maladaptation. Clark
      (1998) argued that a government-insurance industry partnership can benefit
      both the industry and wider society in terms of reduced exposure to both
      climate variability and climate change and maintain the long-term health
      of the insurance industry.<br>
      <br>
      At the one extreme, the insurance industry might be involved in the planning
      process by using its knowledge to discourage development in hazardous locations.
      Information technology is critical for this type of role. At the other extreme,
      the insurance industry might simply ignore the problem (i.e., use no technology)
      and promote maladaptation by repeatedly providing the resources for redevelopment.
      In the short term, this may seem sustainable, but a large natural disaster
      may promote sudden withdrawal of insurance and have serious consequences
      for coastal property values and general development.<br>
      <br>
      An intermediate approach is to link the availability of insurance to appropriate
      regulations on land use in hazardous areas. The U.S. National Flood Insurance
      Program (NFIP) offers an example of this approach. It requires information
      technology to define the hazardous zone, appropriate building technology
      and continuous monitoring of performance (Davison, 1993; OTA, 1993). Training
      and technology transfer are an integral part of the NFIP. In return for
      obeying the codes, all participating communities are eligible for flood
      insurance. Opinions on the success or failure of the NFIP differ. An NFIP
      perspective is that as the property stock is progressively replaced and
      buildings built to code increase as a proportion of the vulnerable stock,
      insured losses will decline significantly relative to a baseline without
      the NFIP. A first-order assessment of the impacts of accelerated sea-level
      rise suggests that the NFIP can be adapted to this change (FEMA, 1991).
      The major deficiency, however, is that erosion is ignored (NRC, 1990; Davison,
      1993). An alternative view is that the NFIP is a classic example of maladaptation.
      Whichever perspective is correct, the NFIP demonstrates that incentives
      and regulations enforced via insurance can promote technology transfer with
      large potential benefits.<br>
      <br>
      While the above examples are mainly focused on climate variability, with
      appropriate anticipatory measures insurance could be used to encourage adaptation
      to climate change, including the necessary technology transfer (e.g., OTA,
      1993; Berz, 1998). The insurance industry is increasingly assessing the
      potential implications of climate change and where they have a market presence,
      their opinion will be an important influence on the timing and nature of
      adaptation.</td>
