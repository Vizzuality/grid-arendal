<h1>3.3 Technology Transfer in International Environment and Development Agreements:
  An Overview </h1>
<h3>3.3.1 Technology Transfer in the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 </h3>
<p>Global efforts to foster sustainable development came together at the Rio &quot;Earth
  Summit&quot; UNCED conference in 1992. At Rio, agreement on the Rio Declaration
  and Agenda 21 sought to define principles and an &quot;action plan&quot; for
  global sustainable development. It was aimed at fostering sustainable development
  through domestic and international actions. The following are of particular
  relevance:</p>
<p>Principle 9 of the Rio Declaration specifically addresses technology transfer:
  &quot;States should cooperate to strengthen endogenous capacity-building for
  sustainable development &#133; through exchanges of scientific and technological
  knowledge, and by enhancing the development, adaptation, diffusion and transfer
  of technologies.&quot; The Declaration also stated that &quot;States should
  cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic system&quot;,
  and that &quot;States should effectively cooperate to discourage or prevent
  the relocation and transfer to other States of any activities and substances
  that cause severe environmental degradation or are found to be harmful to human
  health&quot;. Several other of the Rio Declaration principles addressed requirements
  for states to develop domestic policies supportive of sustainable development,
  including participation, environmental legislation, liability and compensation
  for environmental damage, internalisation of environmental costs, environmental
  impact assessments, and international cooperation. </p>

    <td>Environmentally sound technologies, including expertise, and related issues
      should be made available to developing countries. Developing countries,
      should have access to relevant information on technological choices, and
      the international information exchange systems and clearing houses should
      be developed. Access to and transfer of environmentally sound technology
      should be promoted &quot;on favourable terms, including on concessional
      and preferential terms, as mutually agreed, taking into account the need
      to protect intellectual property rights, as well as the special needs of
      developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21.
      <p>Specific measures should include policies and programmes to encourage
	public and private technology transfer and regulatory measures, include
	subsidies and tax policies, and appropriate mechanisms for improved access
	and transfer of relevant technologies. National capacities, particularly
	of developing countries, should be built to develop and manage environmentally
	sound technologies, including human resource development, and strengthen
	research and development capacities.</p>
      <p>The development of indigenous technology and technology assessment should
	be promoted, &quot;a collaborative network of research centres&quot; should
	be established and &quot;programmes of cooperation and assistance&quot;
	should be strengthened. The importance of technology transfer through
	business commerce is recognised, and while the availability to developing
	countries is of concern, &quot;fair incentives to innovators&quot; should
	also be provided; here the role of patent and property rights should be
	examined. Long-term partnerships between holders and users of environmentally
	sound technologies, and between companies in developed and developing
	countries as well as joint ventures should be promoted.</p>

<p>Agenda 21 supported these principles with more detailed proposals for action.
  Chapter 34 of Agenda 21 was devoted to technology transfer (<a href="037.htm#b32">Box
  3.2</a>). Unlike the two Treaties signed at Rio (UNFCCC, and the Convention
  on Biological Diversity), Agenda 21 does not carry legal force. The extent to
  which these recommendations have been implemented varies, and debate continues
  within the Commission on Sustainable Development. The rest of this section addresses
  issues of technology transfer associated with specific legally-binding multilateral
  environmental agreements.</p>
