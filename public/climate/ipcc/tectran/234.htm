<h1>12.3 Current and Emerging Pathways in Technology Transfer </h1>
<h3>12.3.1 Current Pathways</h3>
<p>Global experience in technology generation and transfer in the forestry sector
  is limited, compared to the agricultural and energy sectors. The pathways are
  complex and country-specific. The three major pathways are: government, private
  sector, and community-initiated. The existing institutions involved in technology
  transfer along with barriers to large-scale technology transfer are listed in
  <a href="234.htm#t122">Table 12.2</a>.</p>
<p>Government Initiated. One of the features of technology transfer in the forestry
  sector is the non-commercial nature of the transfer of some technologies as
  well as low levels of involvement of commercial institutions. Furthermore, the
  forests, forestry research and extension services are largely controlled by
  the governments, particularly in tropical countries. Currently technology transfer
  is largely from the government-controlled universities and research institutions
  to forest departments and farmers. Forestry research and development is largely
  restricted to university and research institutions. These are largely funded
  by the national governments and external development assistance agencies. Yet
  these developing country research institutions are inadequately funded. Nevertheless,
  in Annex I countries, significant research and development (R&amp;D) and technology
  transfer occurs in the private sector.</p>
<p>An analysis of forest research institutions and universities throughout the
  world and their staffing levels clearly shows that very few developing countries
  have capacity in forest science (in terms of numbers of institutes, staff or
  budgets). The effectiveness of the few scientists working on forestry issues
  in developing countries is frequently constrained by shortages of equipment
  and operating budgets, by limited access to scientific advances elsewhere and
  by local institutional issues (FAO, 1997). There are several international institutions
  involved in technology (including information) generation, dissemination and
  capacity building. Some examples are the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
  &quot;Centro Agron&oacute;mico Tropical para Investigaci&oacute;n y Ense&ntilde;anza&quot;(Tropical
  Agriculture Centre for Research and Education) (CATIE), Centre for International
  Forestry Research (CIFOR), (IUFRO), International Centre for Research in Agroforestry
  (ICRAF), (IFGRI) and World Conservation and Monitoring Centre (WCMC). A new
  global framework might, for example, build upon the extensive coverage of IUFRO,
  the inter-disciplinary and collaborative mechanisms of CIFOR, and the practical
  field presence and global data sources of the FAO. </p>
<p>Currently, almost all of the investment projects funded by multilateral agencies
  (World Bank, 1993) and bilateral agencies contain a technical assistance component.
  When the World Bank, the largest multilateral funding agency is considered,
  only US$5.4 billion out of US$396 billion was allocated for environmental projects,
  where forestry is only one of the components and, furthermore, only a marginal
  part of it was devoted to R&amp;D (World Bank, 1997).</p>
<p>Private Sector Dominated. Private sector timber companies and industries (paper
  mills) are increasingly participating in R&amp;D and technology transfer in
  the forestry sector. Technologies and machinery for recycling, harvesting, and
  processing are well developed and largely originate from industrialised countries.
  The private sector is likely to play a larger role in the future, even in developing
  countries (refer to <a href="234.htm#t122">Tables 12.2</a> and <a href="238.htm#t123">12.3</a>).</p>
<p>Community Initiated. A substantial part of technology transfer in the forestry
  sector within developing countries is driven by local communities and NGOs.
  This is particularly true for forest conservation practices, agroforestry systems,
  and systems for harvesting of non-timber and other subsistence products. Much
  of the transfer also takes place in the form of &quot;software&quot;, i.e.,
  training and capacity building. Local institutions, such as NGOs and grassroots
  organisations, are increasingly participating in these technology transfer programmes.
  In some countries, such as Mexico, communities with commercial forest resources
  have organised nation wide organisations of social forestry enterprises. Through
  these organisations villages receive administrative and technical training and
  financial resources.</p>
<p>The existing institutions are currently playing a limited role compared to
  the demands. Currently, there is a marginal role for private sector or industry
  participation in technology transfer. Forest departments, research institutions
  and NGOs are even more constrained by limited financial support and technical
  capability. The existing institutional mechanisms have several limitations to
  promote climate mitigation technologies, namely, limited resources and absence
  of policies and institutions to process, evaluate and approve mitigation projects
  for implementation (Sathaye et al. 1999). </p>
<p>The existing institutions and arrangements are inadequate to meet the emerging
  challenges of promoting forestry-based mitigation projects. In tropical countries,
  the state forest departments play a predominant role in all aspects of forest
  protection, regeneration and management. There are uncertainties regarding the
  areas under tropical forests, rates of deforestation, causes of deforestation
  and the C-densities in vegetation and soil of different forest categories. Such
  information is crucial for developing strategies, projects and technologies
  to reduce deforestation. Currently, the lack of funding and technical capabilities
  in tropical countries limit the generation of information on all of the above
  aspects.</p>
