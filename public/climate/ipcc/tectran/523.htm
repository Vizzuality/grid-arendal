<h1>3.1 Residential, Commercial, and Institutional Buildings Sector </h1>
<p>In the residential, commercial, and institutional building sector energy is
  used to heat and cool buildings, provide lighting, and services ranging from
  cooking to computers. The emissions from the building sector include those from
  the direct use of fossil fuels in buildings and emissions from the fuels used
  to provide electricity and heat to buildings. </p>
<p>Buildings are long lasting and community development patterns have even longer
  lives. The incremental costs of the best technologies are slight at time of
  construction, compared with the cost of replacing energy-wasteful buildings
  and equipment. The technologies themselves are varied and powerful. The IPCC
  Technical Paper I found an existing technical potential to meet the sector's
  global energy needs through 2050 with no increase in energy use from the 1990
  level. </p>
<p>Buildings vary greatly in their size, shape, function, equipment, climate,
  and ownership, all of which affects the mix of technologies needed to improve
  their performance. In some countries, the energy used in housing is &quot;free&quot;
  or subsidised to the occupants. When they don't have to pay the full cost of
  the energy they use, they have less incentive to use it wisely. Where a large
  portion of the occupants would have great difficulty paying the full costs immediately,
  there is strong political pressure to continue the subsidies. </p>
<p>In the near term, the most successful technology transfer programmes won't
  be driven by their environmentally sound benefits alone, but because they also
  meet other human needs and wants. Examples include new energy-efficient buildings
  that are more comfortable and have lower energy costs, as well as lower GHG
  emissions; and the Kenya cookstove that is cheaper and healthier to use, and
  also lowers GHG emissions. The most successful technology programmes focus on
  new products and techniques that have multiple benefits.</p>
<p>The most successful mechanisms for technology transfer include government mandated
  energy and environmental standards for new buildings and equipment; information,
  education and labelling programmes; and government-supported research, development,
  and demonstration (RD&amp;D) programmes. Governments also have a key role in
  creating a market environment for successful private sector-driven technology
  transfer through decisions on full cost pricing, financing, taxes, regulations,
  and customs and duties. Local governments can encourage successful community
  programmes by proactively identifying community-level needs and by encouraging
  and responding to community initiatives.</p>
<br>
<h1><a name="32"></a>3.2 Transport </h1>
<p>Transport- related GHG emissions are the second-fastest growing sector emissions 
  world-wide as shown in <a href="522.htm#tts5">Table TS5</a>, but the transport 
  sector is the least flexible to changes because of its almost dependence on 
  petroleum-based fuels, current entrenched travel lifestyles, and lack of political 
  will. Further, transportation is growing in all regions of the world, 3-4% annually 
  in developed countries and higher in developing countries and air transportation 
  is growing even more rapidly, about 5% annually world-wide. Controlling the 
  associated GHG emissions pose serious challenges because a departure from current 
  lifestyles and use patterns are required in addition to changes in travel movements. 
</p>
<p>However, a number of efforts such as performance gains, safety and energy intensity
  improvements have lead to the development of many technical and non-technical
  options that reduce GHG emissions. Most of these options are technically feasible
  but not all are economically feasible. The cost-effectiveness of most options
  varies among users. Resource availability, technical know-how, institutional
  capacity and local market are among the different factors that affect the cost
  of these options. </p>
<p>Improvements in vehicle technology such as improved engine design or vehicle
  body with the aim of reducing energy intensity can result in reduction of carbon
  emissions. Similarly, low cost actions such as proper maintenance and overall
  servicing of vehicles will lead to both reduction in fuel use and carbon emissions.
  The use of improved gasoline and diesel, and alternative transport fuels such
  as compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), methanol and
  ethanol can also lead to reductions in GHG emissions. Electric vehicles are
  penetrating in niche markets and hydrogen powered vehicles with the potential
  of much reduced GHG emissions could be feasible in the future. The energy intensity
  of aircrafts can be improved with engine modifications and new designs.</p>
<p>Wider use of public transport such as more comfortable and safer buses and
  non-motorised systems such as bicycles, rickshaws, and push-carts are examples
  of options with the supporting infrastructure such as dedicated lanes and improved
  signalling can result in significant environmental benefits including reduction
  of GHG emissions. Changes in transport infrastructure and systems to reduce
  travel trips improve modal choices, and increased freight volume per trip can
  result in reduction of GHG emissions. Also, the use of some non-transport options
  such as improved urban planning, and transport substitution using modern telecommunications
  options can lead to reduce trips and thus GHG reductions. </p>
<p>These options could be transferred within and across countries and regions
  of the world through different mechanisms. Options such as the manufacture and
  improvements of vehicle and aircraft, and developments in fuel technologies
  can be transferred through market oriented paths, while those related to transport
  infrastructure can be through non-market oriented paths such as bilateral and
  multilateral institutions. However, recently, private sector involvement in
  the sector is growing resulting in minimising the difference between these paths.
</p>
<p>However, there are significant technological, economic and institutional barriers
  that can prevent transferring these options within and across countries and
  regions. Lack of suitable local firms to supply components and services required
  by large firms limit technology transfer within countries. Unavailability of
  technical and business information affects penetration within and across countries.
  Local firms suffer from limited access to capital, a barrier that also affects
  many countries especially those requiring transport infrastructure. A non-supportive
  environment for technology transfer for both technology supplier and recipient
  negatively affects the transfer of transport technologies and is amongst others
  reasons due to the lack of political will to take the necessary actions such
  as instituting standards with complimentary compliance regimes.</p>
<p>Various government policies and actions can facilitate the transfer of these
  options in addition to overcoming some of these barriers. They can also provide
  non-climate related benefits such as reduction in local air pollution and road
  congestion. Transfer of technological experiences between countries can stimulate
  promotion of low cost options such as proper vehicle and aircraft maintenance;
  enforceable regulatory systems for inspection and testing of vehicles and aircrafts;
  improved traffic management; and improvements in the quality of drivers. Promotion
  of policies aimed at reduction of transport intensities for passenger systems
  such new public transport modes, local market re-organisation, comfortable walkways,
  wider use of telecommunications, and new freight systems such as dematerialisation,
  regionalisation of production networks, and use of new logistics systems can
  lead to reductions in GHG emissions. Use of environmentally friendly transport
  infrastructure aimed at reduction in travel distance, affecting modal choice,
  and use of dedicated lanes are useful, but can be expensive, time-consuming
  and may require behavioural and lifestyle changes. </p>
<p>Encouraging co-operative technology programmes between countries and enterprises
  can result in the transfer of many of these options. These programmes may include
  joint R&amp;D, design and manufacture, and information networks on management
  and specific technical skills. Encouraging sub-contracting among firms and enterprises
  will promote the transfer of technical and managerial skills. However, governments
  of technology recipients need to build further local capacities for information
  development and exchange, technology assessment and selection, negotiation abilities,
  and support infrastructure, as these will create the enabling environment for
  effective technology transfer and development.</p>
<p>The need for commitment from governments is crucial in stimulating technology
  transfer, both for technology outflows and technology inflows. Instituting policies
  that promote transport technology outflows such as special incentives for ESTs
  and build capacities to receive technology inflows through an improved business
  environment will be important in increasing the flow of ESTs in the transport
  sector. </p>
