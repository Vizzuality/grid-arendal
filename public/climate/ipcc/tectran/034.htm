<h1>
  Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The topic of technology transfer has been an important part of international
  discussions on development policy for decades. In the context of environment
  and development, technology transfer was a key element in the United Nations
  Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) agreements, including Chapter
  34 of Agenda 21 and several Articles in the UNFCCC. These agreements note that
  effective technology transfer will be essential to meet the global challenges
  and to enable collaboration between developing and developed countries for the
  transfer of technologies. This will depend both upon local initiatives and regulations
  - many of which (such as efficiency improvements) could be beneficial anyway
  - and various international agreements that bear upon the technology transfer
  process. </p>
<p>Governments effectively own some important technologies, and these will require
  government-driven pathways. For private-sector pathways, harnessing the bulk
  of international investment, intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes are
  an important consideration. Overall the literature is diverse concerning the
  relationship between IPRs and technology transfer. Stronger IPRs, particularly
  resulting from the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIP) agreement,
  may foster innovation and vertical technology transfer, but could impede horizontal
  dissemination of certain technologies through private-sector and community-driven
  pathways. Compliance with decisions reached in Agenda 21, UNGASS 1997 and other
  relevant fora is important in this regard, and the TRIP agreement allows for
  compulsory licensing as a last resort if other avenues are exhausted and with
  due compensation. A number of international mechanisms are available for bilateral
  and multilateral financial assistance including, for example, international
  financial assistance for licensing relevant technologies. This could be one
  way for the international regime to support technology transfer where market-driven,
  grants, equity investment, and joint venture solutions are not feasible. IPR
  regimes could be harnessed more widely to support innovation and dissemination
  of environmentally sound technologies (ESTs). Industry standards, including
  management standards developed through the International Standards Organization
  (ISO) and sectoral standards for some industries, could also play an important
  role in fostering global dissemination of ESTs. </p>
<p>Specific provisions on technology transfer form an important part of &quot;positive
  measures&quot; in several multilateral environmental agreements, which help
  to foster effectiveness and stability of these regimes. Apart from financial
  mechanisms, there is little empirical evidence concerning how technology transfer
  provisions have operated in practice. The most extensive experience is with
  the Montreal Protocol, where the Multilateral Fund (1998), working together
  with a multitude of supporting institutions and networks, has facilitated extensive
  technology transfer. </p>
<p>The UNFCCC itself spawned a number of technology-oriented initiatives. Attempts
  to set up Technology Assessment Panels failed primarily due to disagreements
  over representation. The Climate Technology Initiative is expanding as an important
  supporting endeavour though its impact is as yet difficult to evaluate. Ways
  of discouraging transfer of inferior technology need to be found. The text in
  the Kyoto Protocol recognises the need for cooperation and enhancement of supportive
  conditions, including for the private sector in developing countries, as well
  as the responsibilities of Annex II Parties. The project-level mechanisms of
  Joint Implementation (JI) and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could be
  important avenues for furthering international technology transfer. This, however,
  does not absolve Annex II Parties from their commitments. The COP4 decision
  on technology transfer represents an important new opportunity for furthering
  technology transfer under the Convention. Ultimately, however, it is what happens
  within countries, and companies, that will do the most to determine the pace
  and nature of technology transfer. </p>
