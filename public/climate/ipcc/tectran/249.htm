<h1>12.6 Examples of Conditions and Policies that Facilitate Technology Transfer</h1>
<p> What policies, measures and other preconditions help facilitate technology
  transfer in the forestry sector with climate change benefits? A brief review
  of the limited experience suggests that some such facilitating conditions can
  be identified. <a href="249.htm#t126">Table 12.6</a> presents a few examples of technology transfer and
  identifies policy, socio-economic, or technological conditions that helped facilitate
  the successful transfer of new practices. <br>

      capture in forest concessions, helped Innoprise open to innovations to reduce
      residual tree damage, raising profits in later harvests.Sabah State government

<p>
  The patterns and relative ease or difficulty of transfer of forestry technologies
  with climate change mitigation benefits largely have been guided by three major
  factors. The first is national government's position and policies on climate
  change, emerging in the context of the UNFCCC Convention and the proposed Kyoto
  Protocol. These have provided signals, if not clear economic or policy drivers,
  of potential future incentive, regulatory, tax, or other policies to reduce
  GHG emissions in Annex I countries, and to encourage or inhibit GHG mitigation
  activities in CEITs and developing countries. The second factor is national
  economic and forest policies, especially relating to forest concessions, timber
  production, and exports. The third factor is competitiveness of new technologies,
  in terms of offering enhanced efficiency and cost savings. <br>
  <br>
  The Energy Policy Act of 1992 in the U.S. established a voluntary programme
  for companies to report GHG emissions reduction activities. U.S. electric utility
  companies began to contract with private and NGO partners like The Nature Conservancy
  and World Resources Institute, to identify and fund pilot carbon offset projects
  (Dixon et al., 1994; Panayotou et al., 1994). It added capability to assess
  natural forest management and preserved areas, and led to the implementation
  of training and methodology development programmes in Belize (Belize, 1997)
  and Bolivia, where informal climate policies were receptive to cooperation.
  Private utilities seek cost-effective and reduced-risk delivery of tonnes of
  carbon. Dual camera aerial videography is currently being field tested or deployed
  in forest management or carbon offset projects in Ohio (USA), Indonesia, and
  Bolivia, as a means of improving the accuracy, and decreasing the costs of carbon
  estimates and monitoring.<br>
  <br>
  Examples of enabling conditions for a few selected technologies are presented
  in <a href="249.htm#t127">Table 12.7</a> (<a href="051.htm">Chapter 4</a> provides an general overview
  on the role of enabling environments for technology transfer). The selection
  of the mitigation technology to be utilised is likely to require, the presence
  of specific types of policies, measures, and economic considerations. Similarly,
  the type of mitigation activity will largely determine the kind of technologies
  likely to be transferred by private, public, or multilateral entities participating
  in the activity. <br>

  <i>
  Costs involved in Technology Transfer:</i> The cost and funding of technology
  transfer varies by technology and the biophysical, economic and policy setting
  in which it is deployed. Generally, technologies are more likely to be transferred
  if they are cost-effective relative to existing practices, if the cost savings
  benefit the technology provider directly or indirectly, and if the relative
  ease of transferal is high (e.g., Panayotou et al., 1994). The incentives for
  investor companies or governments are high whenever the forest concession or
  timber production policies, or rent capture demands of alternative forestry
  practices are likely to confer benefits (public, social welfare, environmental
  or private sector profit benefits) (Gillis,1992; Vincent and Binkley, 1992).
  Financial conditions that favour the transfer of new technologies might include
  both low initial costs but demonstrated benefits (e.g., reduced impact logging,
  if existing harvest equipment can be used; Putz and Pinard, 1993); and conditions
  where low to high initial costs are offset by high investor confidence in recovery
  of investment (e.g., more efficient milling equipment in a mill owned by a private
  investor with a secure, long-term concession or lease; Vincent and Binkley,
  1992). Technologies that are developed by public or nonprofit institutions,
  especially analytic and resource management innovations like carbon estimation
  software or methods, incorporating high intellectual but low capital inputs,
  tend to be transferred readily and early (Brown et al., 1997).</p>
