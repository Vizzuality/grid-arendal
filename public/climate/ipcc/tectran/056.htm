<h1>4.4 Social Infrastructure: the Need for Participatory Approaches </h1>
<p>As mentioned in the chapter's introduction, the re-thinking of established
  approaches to the role of the state in relation to economic and governance agendas
  (&quot;too much state&quot; vs. &quot;too little state&quot;) took a specific
  form at international and national levels in relation to development and technology
  transfer. The historical legacy of development efforts provoked a serious reassessment
  of the appropriate roles of the community, government and private sector in
  development and technology transfer.</p>
<p>Following the end of World War II and the period of decolonisation, orthodox
  views of development argued that &quot;latecomers&quot; in the development process
  should benefit from modern technologies. However, by the 1970s and 1980s, the
  effects of an overly simplistic approach to development through industrialisation,
  and the sometimes-harmful effect of economic and political motives by donor
  nations became noticeable. Increased unemployment, rural-urban migration, foreign
  debts, ineffective projects and growing technological dependency brought into
  question the appropriateness of the technology being transferred to developing
  countries. But by the 1990s, the changed geopolitical and economic environment
  finally allowed serious official attention to be given to approaches to development
  that emphasised the need for balance between state, market and civil organisations.
  This has had two consequences. First, participatory approaches have been introduced
  to mediate a better match between host country requirements and donor assistance,
  and these have a broad resonance with the development of forms of good governance
  (OECD, 1997). There has been a massive shift in thinking (but only to a lesser
  extent in priorities), from things and infrastructure (&quot;technology transfer&quot;)
  to people and capabilities (knowledge and learning; Chambers, 1997). Secondly,
  the stated development policy of governments and multilateral institutions has
  come to be dominated by what has been called a 'new Policy Agenda', where increasing
  amounts of aid are channelled to and through NGOs, rather than governments,
  in recipient countries (Edwards and Hulme, 1995).</p>
