<p>The review of recent literature on acidification impact studies given in Gr�bler
  (1998c) concludes that the impacts on human health, on economically important
  food crops, and on ecosystems are so substantial as to render any scenario with
  SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions as high as, or higher than, IS92a very unlikely. Gr�bler (1998c)
  carried out a detailed comparison of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions scenarios at the global and
  regional level. He concluded that the range of future SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions spanned
  by the previous high-demand IPCC scenarios (all IS92 scenarios except IS92c
  and IS92d) corresponded well with scenarios available in the literature that
  do not include any direct sulfur-emissions control or indirect intervention
  measures and policies (<a href="#fig318">Figure 3-18</a>). Typically, in such
  scenarios, global SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions could rise to between 130 and 250 MtS by 2100,
  and in some older scenarios (Matsuoka <i>et al</i>., 1994; Morita <i>et al</i>.,
  1994) are projected to rise above that level. Interestingly, all long-term sulfur
  scenarios published since 1995 do not judge this to be a likely (not to mention
  environmentally desirable) possibility. Representative sulfur-emissions control
  and intervention scenarios (Amann <i>et al</i>., 1995; Posch <i>et al</i>.,
  1996; Nakicenovic <i>et al</i>., 1998a) suggest instead an upper range of
  global emissions below 100 MtS by 2050 and below 120 MtS by 2100, a range covered
  in the two low variants IS92c and IS92d only. These patterns were also confirmed
  by Pepper et al. (1998) in a recent re-analysis of the previous IS92 scenarios.
  Using the same methodology as deployed in developing the IS92 scenarios, the
  revised scenarios have maximum global SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions below 142 MtS by 2020, and
  56 MtS by 2100 (EPA3 and EPA5 scenarios, respectively). The median from the
  more recent scenario literature analyzed in Gr�bler (1998c) indicates near-constant
  global SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions - 77 MtS by 2020, 68 MtS by 2060, and 57 MtS by 2100. This
  global stability, however, masks decisive regional differences (discussed above).
  Emissions in the OECD countries will continue their declining trends in line
  with their sulfur reduction policies. Emissions outside OECD will rise initially
  with increasing energy demand, but sulfur controls will be progressively phased
  in to mitigate against impacts of high unabated SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions on health, agriculture,
  ecosystems, and tourism.</p>
<p>The need to abate local air pollution, including SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions, is not only
  environmental, but also economic. For example, according to the World Bank (1997c,
  1997d) the current damage by environmental pollution is about 8% of GDP in China
  (and up to 20% of production in urban areas), while abatement costs would be
  between 1 and 2.5% of GDP. According to one World Bank (1997c) report, the costs
  are "so high under the business-as-usual scenario that it is hardly necessary
  to consider the amenity and ecosystem benefits of cleaner air to justify action."
  Therefore, it is no surprise that in several developing regions, policies are
  already being developed and implemented to abate SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions. In China, by
  1995 coal-cleaning technology had been developed, and de-sulfurizing technology
  introduced and applied (Government of People's Republic of China, 1996). The
  SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions target set by the Chinese government is 12.3 MtS by 2000 as compared
  to 11.9 MtS in 1995. Economic instruments, such as pollution charges, pricing
  policy, favorable terms of investment for environmental technology, market creation,
  and ecological compensation fees, are being introduced in China now (UNEP, 1999).
  By June 1997, some 64,000 enterprises with heavy pollutant emissions had been
  closed for refurbishment or had ceased production. As a consequence, ambient
  concentrations of sulfur have been relatively stable in medium-size and small
  cities, and they have actually decreased in large cities. This change is occurring
  at significantly lower levels of income as compared to income levels in the
  USA and Europe at the time when their sulfur abatement started.</p>
<p>In India, several sulfur policies are being introduced currently, including
  mandatory washing of coal used 500 km away from the mine mouth, a policy that
  is expected to significantly reduce SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions from coal use. Some refineries
  have already advertised their investments (and efforts) to meet this standard.
  In a landmark case on the Taj trapezium (a 10,400 km <sup>2</sup> area surrounding
  the Taj Mahal), the Supreme Court of India has ordered a limit on the sulfur
  content of diesel sold in this area to within 0.25% (Shukla, personal communication).
  The Indian government has spent US$1.34 billion to reduce the sulfur content
  in diesel from 1% to 0.25% by weight (Mr. K.P. Shahi, Advisor to the Ministry
  of Petroleum and Natural Gas, as quoted in Down to Earth, February 15, 1999,
  page 15).</p>
<p>These policies already have had an effect on emissions. Streets et al. (2000)
  analyzed the impact since 1990 of these policies and new energy and emissions
  factor data on emissions in Asia<sup><small><a href="fn4.htm#5" onClick="showFootnote(4,5); return false;">5</a></small></sup>.
  They found that emissions may have increased in Asia from 16.9 MtS in 1990 to
  only 19.3 MtS in 1995, rather than to the 26.7 MtS projected in the earlier
  studies with the RAINS-ASIA model. The authors conclude that SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in
  Asia have not grown nearly as fast as was thought likely in the early 1990s,
  with major implications for projections beyond the year 2000. It is probable
  that the emissions trajectory will be even lower as a result of increasing environmental
  awareness in many countries of Southeast Asia and East Asia, the implementation
  of China's "two-control-zone" policy, and the downturn of Southeast Asia economies
  in the late 1990s (Streets <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>In Latin America, the contribution of coal-fired power plants to total power
  generation is relatively low and consequently SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions are lower than those
  in other regions. This contribution is not expected to increase significantly
  in the future. It is expected that the rate of increase of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in
  Latin America will be reduced because environmental agencies in several Latin
  American countries are already enforcing strict SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions standards. Also,
  increases in power generation are expected to be mainly from combined cycle
  natural gas plants (La Rovere and Americano, 1998).</p>
<p>Different methodologies have been developed to assess the sulfur control scenarios
  in integrated assessment models. Gr�bler (1998c) has summarized the literature,
  and classifies three main modeling approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ecological targets, and analysis of events when critical acidification loads
    are exceeded (e.g., Amann <i>et al</i>., 1995; Foell <i>et al</i>., 1995;
    Hettelingh <i>et al</i>., 1995; Posch <i>et al</i>., 1996; Nakicenovic <i>et
    al</i>., 1997).</li>
  <li>The pollutant burden approach (e.g., Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1997).</li>
  <li>Income driven approaches (e.g., Smith <i>et al</i>., 2000).</li>
</ul>
<p>Although models differ in their analytical representation of the driving forces
  of sulfur reduction policies and also provide a range of possible futures, invariably
  all scenarios yield comparatively low future SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions. Alcamo et al. (1997)
  estimates a 95% probability that global SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions will be below 120 MtS
  by 2050 and decline thereafter. Their 50% probability level suggests emissions
  of 90 MtS by 2050 and 57 MtS by 2100, the latter being identical to the median
  from the scenario literature analyzed in <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
<p>Increasingly, energy sector and integrated assessment models are able to link
  regional acidification models with simplified climate models, which enables
  joint analysis of sulfur and climate policies and impacts. Examples include
  the IMAGE model (Posch <i>et al</i>., 1996) and the IIASA model (Rogner and
  Nakicenovic, 1996; McDonald, 1999; Riahi and Roehrl, 2000), which are linked
  with the acidification model RAINS for Europe and Asia, or the AIM (Morita <i>et
  al</i>., 1994) model for Asia. These models extend earlier energy sector models
  that dealt with a comparative costs assessment of isolated sulfur and carbon
  reductions and joint mitigation, such as the OECD GREEN model (Complainville
  and Martins, 1994) or the IIASA MESSAGE model (Gr�bler, 1998b; Nakicenovic
  <i>et al</i>., 1998a). The state of knowledge and availability of models to
  study the joint benefits of sulfur and carbon emission reductions was reviewed
  in the 1995 IPCC SAR WGIII Report (Bruce <i>et al</i>., 1996) and is expanding
  rapidly (CIRED <i>et al</i>., 1997; Nakicenovic <i>et al</i>., 1997; Gr�bler,
  1998c). </p>
