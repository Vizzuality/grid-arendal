<h3>4.4.5. Energy Intensities, Energy Demand, and Structure of Energy Use</h3>
<p>Population and GDP assumptions, along with structural change and technological
  change that affect energy efficiency and energy costs (and prices), drive the
  demand for energy services. Given the different model representations of energy
  service demands, in this section final energy use is discussed as a common measurement
  point across all SRES models and scenarios. Final energy use per unit economic
  activity, that is, energy intensity, is a frequently used measure of comparative
  efficiency of resource use, and reflects a whole range of structural, technological,
  and lifestyle factors (Schipper and Meyers, 1992).</p>

<p><a href="#fig46">Figure 4-6</a> illustrates the evolution of final energy
  intensities for the four SRES marker scenarios. Instead of time, per capita
  income is shown on the horizontal axis, to illustrate a conditional convergence
  of regional final energy intensities. Invariably, intensities are projected
  to decline with increasing income levels. As discussed in <a href="049.htm">Chapter
  3</a>, the main reason for this trend stems from the common source of economic
  growth and energy intensity improvements - technological change. All else being
  equal, the faster intensity improvements are, the faster aggregate productivity
  (per capita income) grows. An important methodologic improvement over previous
  studies is the explicit inclusion of non-commercial energy forms in some SRES
  models, drawing on estimates as reported in IPCC WGII SAR (Watson et al., 1996)
  and in Nakicenovic et al. (1998).</p>
<p>In the A1 and B1 scenarios, per capita income differences are substantially
  narrowed and convergent because of increased economic integration and rapid
  technological change. Therefore, differences in energy intensities are also
  narrowed significantly and are convergent, as shown in <a href="#fig46">Figure
  4.6</a>. The B1 storyline describes a development path to a less material-intensive
  economy. Hence, the final energy intensities in the B1 marker are lowest among
  the four SRES marker scenarios for a given per capita income level. The A2 storyline
  reflects a world with less rapid technological change, as shown by the smallest
  rate of energy intensity improvement among the four marker scenarios<a href="fn5.htm#25" onClick="showFootnote(5,25); return false;"><sup>25</sup></a>.
  Different interpretations of the four scenario storylines, as well as alternative
  rates of energy intensity improvement to the four marker scenarios, are discussed
  below.</p>
<p>Owing to methodologic differences across the six models (see <a href="#box47">Box
  4-7</a>) it is not possible to disaggregate energy intensity improvements into
  various components, such as structural change, price effects, technological
  change, etc., in a consistent way. In some models (macro-economic) price effects
  are differentiated from "everything else" (frequently labeled AEEI, or autonomous
  energy intensity improvements). As a rule, the importance of non-price factors
  is an inverse function of the time horizon considered. Over the short-term,
  the impacts of economic structural change and technology diffusion are necessarily
  low. Hence, prices assume a paramount importance in driving alternative energy
  demand patterns in short-term (to 2010-2020) scenario studies (e.g., IEA, 1998;
  EIA, 1997, 1999). Over the longer term (i.e., the time horizon considered by
  the SRES scenarios), economic structural and technological changes become more
  pronounced, as does their influence on energy intensity improvements and energy
  demand. This does not imply that prices do not matter over the long term, but
  simply that "everything else" (e.g., AEEI) is likely to outweigh the impacts
  of prices, as indeed suggested by quantitative scenario analyses performed within
  the Energy Modeling Forum EMF-14 (Weyant, 1995).</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" >
  <tr>
    <td colspan="9">
      <p><b>Box 4-7: The Role of Prices in SRES Scenarios</b></p>
      <p>The price of energy comprises many components:</p>
      <ul>
	    <li>Costs to establish and maintain the production, conversion, transport,
	  and distribution infrastructure of energy supply. </li>
        <li>Profit margins.</li>
        <li>A whole host of levies such as royalties and taxes raised at the points
	  of energy production or use. </li>
        <li>Consumers' willingness to pay for quality and convenience of energy
	  services.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Furthermore, given the importance of energy and the vast volumes traded,
	prices are influenced by a whole range of additional factors, from inevitable
	elements of speculation to geopolitical considerations, all of which can
	decouple energy price trends from any underlying physical balance between
	supply and demand. Taxes are especially significant. In a number of OECD
	countries, up to 80% of the consumer price of gasoline is taxes (OECD,
	1998), and the differences between countries are enormous. In 1997, 27%
	of the price of gasoline in the USA was taxes, compared with 78% in France.
	Taxes vary substantially even between large oil producers (and exporters).
	In Mexico taxes are 13% of gasoline prices, but in Norway they are 75%
	(OECD, 1998). </p>
      <p>Currently, no methodologies exist to project future energy prices taking
	all of above mentioned factors into account, nor were the SRES scenarios
	intended to make explicit assumptions on such factors such as future energy
	taxation. Price information enters long-term emission models either in
	the form of exogenous scenario assumptions, or it is derived internally
	in models based on simplified representations of price formation mechanisms
	usually based on (marginal) cost information. </p>
      <p>The six models used for SRES range from detailed "bottom-up" models (e.g.,
	AIM, IMAGE), through macro-economic (partial equilibrium) models (e.g.,
	MARIA, MiniCAM), to hybrid approaches (successive iteration between the
	engineering model MESSAGE with a macro-economic model, or using the Worldscan
	model with IMAGE). Each has different representations of price formation
	mechanisms and their relationship to macro-economic or sectoral energy
	demand. These are summarized in <a href="150.htm">Appendix IV</a>.
	As a rule, "bottom-up" (optimization) models calculate only (average and
	marginal) costs endogenously. As a result of their sectoral perspective
	(energy, agriculture, etc.), these models cannot determine macro-economic
	feedbacks on other sectors or the entire economy and thus are unable to
	represent a consistent picture of price formation. Conversely, price formation
	is endogenized in "top-down" models; however, these rely on the stringent
	assumption that demand and supply must be in equilibrium and in addition
	provide little sectoral detail. Over recent years this simplified modeling
	dichotomy has progressively weakened because of further advances in methodology
	and the development of "hybrid" modeling approaches. To illustrate the
	methodologies deployed in the six SRES models, two (MARIA and MESSAGE)
	are discussed here, but (for space limitations) only in terms of one scenario
	(B2). (<a href="#tbl49">Table 4-9</a> gives additional details of an inter-scenario
	comparison of energy prices for the MiniCAM and ASF models. Owing to methodologic
	differences, a comparison of prices across scenarios is only possible
	within a consistent approach (i.e. be comparing scenarios quantified with
	the same model).)</p>
      <p>The energy prices represented in MARIA (see also Mori, 2000) consist
	of energy production and energy utilization costs. Market prices are determined
	endogenously by model-calculated shadow prices (for further model details
	see Appendix IV and Mori and Takahashi, 1999). Among various parameters,
	the extraction costs of fossil fuel resources and the coefficients of
	utilization costs and their evolution over time are the most important
	determinants. For the MARIA runs, the resource estimates of Rogner (1997)
	were used as input. For the sake of simplicity, all fossil resource categories
	of Rogner (1997) were aggregated into two classes and a quadratic production
	function was used to interpolate the extraction costs of reserves and
	all other occurrences. For coal, long-term extraction costs range up to
	US$6.3 per GJ in 1990US$ prices, for gas up to US$25 per GJ, and for oil
	up to US$28 per GJ (see Appendix IV for further details). The energy cost
	coefficients (representing 16 different energy conversion technologies)
	are based on Manne and Richels (1992). For the B2 scenario quantification,
	the Manne and Richels (1992) estimates were largely retained. For instance,
	electricity generation costs range between 14 mills<a href="fn5.htm#26" onClick="showFootnote(5,26); return false;"><sup>26</sup></a>
	/kWh for gas to 51 mills/kWh for coal. (For the other scenario quantifications
	these cost values were modified to conform to the different interpretations
	of a particular scenario storyline.) Together these assumptions determined
	long-run costs and shadow prices that were set equal to energy prices
	in the macro-economic production function of MARIA. The energy prices
	were combined with assumed (low) AEEI values and potential GDP growth
	rates (the latter from the B2 marker) to calculate the resultant aggregate
	energy demand in the model. The resultant primary energy demand was (with
	exception of the REF region) within 15% of the respective B2 marker quantification
	at the regional level and within 5% of global energy demand. As a result
	of different model structures, comparable price data for the MESSAGE model
	are only available for internationally traded primary energy forms (these
	are given in <a href="102.htm#tab48">Table 4-8</a>).</p>
      <p>The bottom-up, systems engineering (optimization) model MESSAGE does
	not compute energy prices. Instead, the model is entirely based on cost
	information, but such costs are treated as dynamic. Their overall treatment
	follows the lines outlined above for the MARIA model, except that greater
	technology-specific detail is contained in the model. Altogether 19 different
	fossil resource grades are differentiated, based on the estimates of Rogner
	(1997). The resultant (levelized) extraction costs for the B2 marker are
	in the range US$1.1 to US$5.4 per GJ for coal, US$1.2 to US$5.3 per GJ
	for oil, and US$1.2 to US$5.7 per GJ for gas (range indicates costs variations
	between lowest and highest costs of the four SRES regions for 2020, 2050,
	and 2100 respectively, see <a href="150.htm">Appendix IV</a>). Technology-specific cost assumptions
	cannot be summarized here as MESSAGE contains literally hundreds of energy
	supply and end-use technologies. Examples of cost assumptions are given
	in Section <a href="105.htm">4.4.7</a> and more detail is reported in
	Riahi and Roehrl (2000). However, as in MARIA, MESSAGE also calculates
	shadow prices for internationally traded primary energy forms and therefore
	these two indicators can be compared (<a href="102.htm#tab48">Table 4-8</a>).</p>
    </td>

</table>
<p>Important feedback mechanisms between technological change and costs (and thus
  also prices) exist over the long term. These are as a rule treated endogenously
  in the models, for instance when modeling long-run resource extraction costs
  or structural changes in energy supply options (see Sections <a href="104.htm">4.4.6</a>
  and <a href="105.htm">4.4.7</a>). Energy prices are also strongly affected by
  policies (e.g., taxation), but to project these far into the future is both
  outside the capability of currently available methodologies and outside the
  general "policy neutral" stance of the SRES scenarios. Therefore, most models
  treat dynamic changes in (average and marginal) <i>costs</i> as the driving
  force for energy intensity improvements and for technology choice (see Sections
  <a href="104.htm">4.4.6</a> and <a href="105.htm">4.4.7</a>).</p>
<h4>4.4.5.1. A1 Scenarios<a name="4451"></a></h4>
<p>Improvements in energy efficiency on the demand side are assumed to be relatively
  low in the A1B marker scenario, because of low energy prices caused by rapid
  technological progress in resource availability and energy supply technologies
  (see Sections <a href="104.htm">4.4.6</a> and <a href="105.htm">4.4.7</a>).
  These low energy prices provide little incentive to improve end-use-energy efficiencies
  and high income levels encourage comfortable and convenient(and often energy
  intensive) lifestyles (especially in the household, service, and transport sectors).
  Efficient technologies are not fully introduced into the end-use side, dematerialization
  processes in the industrial sector are not well promoted, lifestyles become
  energy intensive, and private motor vehicles are used more in developing countries
  as per capita GDP increases. Conversely, fast rates of economic growth and capital
  turnover and rising incomes also enable the diffusion of more efficient technologies
  and economic structural changes, with consequent improvements in energy intensity.
  As a result, the rate of energy intensity improvement in Annex I countries is
  around 1.16% per year, and in non-Annex I countries 1.44% over the 100 years
  to 2100. Thus, final energy use for A1 is much higher than those in the A2,
  B1, and B2 scenarios, with a substantial long-term convergence in final energy
  use per capita between Annex 1 countries and non-Annex 1 countries.<br>

      <p>To achieve consistency between model-calculated energy cost dynamics
	and energy demand assumptions an iterative modeling procedure between
	MESSAGE and MACRO (a macro-economic production function model based on
	Manne and Richels, 1992) was used, on the basis of model-calculated shadow
	prices as indicators of future price dynamics. The methodology is described
	in more detail in Wene (1996). This approach requires time-intensive model
	iterations, but has the advantage that the impact of price increases can
	be separated from efficiency improvements through fuel substitution (e.g.,
	a gas-fired cook stove energy end-use efficiency is up to 10 times higher
	than a traditional cook stove fired with fuelwood) as well as from "everything
	else," i.e., the AEEI in the traditional sense). Aggregated, the impact
	of (shadow) price increases in MESSAGE's B2 scenario accounts for 8% of
	global primary energy demand by 2020, 23% by 2050, and 30% by 2100. This
	impact is calculated as a reduction in energy demand compared to a hypothetical
	scenario with constant 1990 prices (and correspondingly higher energy
	demand). The impact of price increases on future energy demand in the
	B2 scenario is thus relatively small compared to that of other factors,
	although far from negligible. This also explains why the two B2 scenario
	quantifications by MARIA and MESSAGE have quite similar energy demand
	figures, even if international trade prices may differ. First, trade prices
	are only one component of the cost-price mechanism treated in the models
	(which also includes domestic energy production, conversion, and end-use
	costs). Second, models differ in their parametrizations of the "everything
	else" (AEEI) model parameters, for which a wide range of views on applicable
	ranges exists. Therefore it is one of the model calibration parameters
	frequently used to replicate existing scenarios or to standardize inter-model
	comparison projects such as EMF-14 (Weyant, 1995).<br>
