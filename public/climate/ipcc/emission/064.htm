<h4>3.3.4.8. Development Patterns<a name="anc1"></a></h4>
<p>The key questions about how future development patterns determine GHG emissions
  thus include the following.</p>
<p><i>Material and energy content of development in industrial countries:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Will structural change toward services and increasing importance of information
    as a "raw material" reduce the energy and matter content of economic activity?</li>
  <li>Will telecommunications substitute significantly for travel or encourage
    more of it?</li>
  <li>Will growth in transportation and other energy-using activities, stimulated
    by trade liberalization, be offset by less material intensive development
    patterns?</li>
  <li>Will the tendency to saturation in some energy end-use requirements be offset
    by new energy or GHG intensive goods and services (e.g., in leisure activities)?</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Development patterns in the developing countries:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Will developing countries reproduce the development paths of industrial
    countries with respect to energy use and GHG emissions?</li>
  <li>Is there a potential for technological "leapfrogging" whereby developing
    countries bypass dirty intermediate technologies and jump straight to cleaner
    technologies?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <i> Links among energy, transport and urban planning:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Will modal choices and urban-form decisions tend toward less or greater
    energy intensity?</li>
  <li>How are significant differences within and between industrial and developing
    countries going to evolve in the future?</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Land use and human settlements:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the links between agriculture, forestry, rural-to- urban migration,
    energy use, GHG, and sulfur emissions, particularly in developing countries?</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Distribution issues:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the links between development patterns, distribution of income,
    energy use and GHG emissions?</li>
</ul>
<p><i>The informal economy:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the link between informal economic activities and GHG emissions?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The effect of development pattern assumptions in the assessment of future GHG
  emissions is greater for developing countries. As a major part of the needed
  infrastructure to meet development needs is still to be built in the developing
  countries, the spectrum of future options is considerably wider than that in
  industrial countries. The traditional approach to assume "business-as-usual"
  as the baseline is particularly meaningless in such cases; instead there is
  a need for multiple baselines for different scenarios built to cover the range
  of possible futures. It cannot be assumed that developing countries will automatically
  follow the past development paths of industrial countries. The significant transformations
  that recently intervened in the international economy and energy markets highlight
  the important dangers of such a double analogy, both in space and time. It can
  also be argued that many developing countries may have passed already any developmental
  bifurcation point, in which case developments could follow the patterns of industrialized
  countries.</p>
<p>Both the GDP structure and the physical basis on which it is to be achieved
  in developing countries have to be considered. A crucial question regards their
  share in the world production of highly energy- and pollution-intensive goods,
  such as steel and aluminum. As the recent shift of heavy industries from the
  industrial toward the developing countries ends, long-term economic output could
  come from services and other less energy-intensive activities.</p>
<p>Moreover, technological choices, both in production and consumption apparatus,
  can substantially decrease the energy demand per GDP. For instance, Chinese
  households are not bound to adopt the same model of energy-intensive refrigerators
  that have equipped American families. Similarly, future cement factories in
  developing countries should not fail to include up-to-date technological improvements,
  such as the dry process.</p>
<p>The spatial distribution of the population and its economic activities is still
  unclear, which raises the possibility of adopting urban and/or regional planning.
  Industrial policies directed at rural development and strengthening the role
  of small and medium cities would reduce the extent of rural exodus and the degree
  of demographic concentration in large cities.</p>
<p>These examples show that developing countries could adopt anticipative strategies
  to avoid, in the long-term, the problems faced today by industrial societies
  ("leapfrogging"). Such alternative development patterns highlight the technical
  feasibility of emission futures in the developing regions that can be compatible
  with national objectives. However, the barriers to a more sustainable development
  in the developing regions can hardly be underestimated, and range from financial
  constraints to cultural behaviors (in both industrial and developing countries),
  which include the lack of appropriate institutional structures.</p>
