<h2>4.1. Introduction</h2>
<p>In Chapter 4 the main characteristics of the scenarios developed for the Special
  Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES scenarios) are presented. These scenarios
  cover a wide range of driving forces from demographic to social and economic
  developments, and they encompass a wide range of future greenhouse gas (GHG)
  emissions (see <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>). Chapters <a href="034.htm">2</a>
  and <a href="049.htm">3</a> provide an overview and assessment of the scenario
  literature, the main driving forces of future GHG emissions, and their relationships.
  How the driving forces are combined to produce a set of scenarios that cover
  the ranges of GHG emissions from the literature is described in this chapter.</p>
<p>Chapters <a href="034.htm">2</a> and <a href="049.htm">3</a> demonstrate the
  large uncertainty in the literature that surrounds both future emissions and
  the possible developments of their underlying driving forces. The uncertainties
  range from inadequate scientific understanding of the problems, through data
  gaps or lack of data, to the inherent uncertainties of future events in general.
  Hence alternative scenarios are used to describe the range of possible future
  emissions.</p>
<p>The SRES approach involved the development of a set of four alternative scenario
  "families" (see <a href="023.htm">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="030.htm">Section 1.7.2</a>). Each family
  of SRES scenarios includes a descriptive part (called a "storyline") and a number
  of alternative interpretations and quantifications of each storyline developed
  by six different modeling approaches (see also <a href="025.htm#box11">Box 1-1</a>
  on terminology). Each storyline describes a demographic, social, economic, technological,
  and policy future for each of the scenario families. Within each family different
  scenarios explore variations of global and regional developments and their implications
  for GHG, ozone precursors, and sulfur emissions. Each of these scenarios is
  consistent with the broad framework specified by the storyline of the scenario
  family.</p>
<p>Each storyline is basically a short "history" of a possible future development
  expressed as a combination of key scenario characteristics. These descriptions
  are stylized and designed to facilitate specification and further interpretation
  of scenario quantifications. The storylines identify particular dynamics, visible
  in the world today, that might have important influences on future GHG emissions.
  They deliberately explore what might happen if social, economic, technical,
  and policy developments take a particular direction at the global level; they
  also pay attention to regional differences and interactions, especially between
  developing and industrialized countries.</p>

	reality, the four scenarios share a space of a much higher dimensionality
	given the numerous driving forces and other assumptions needed to define
	any given scenario in a particular modeling approach. The A1 storyline
	branches out into different groups of scenarios to illustrate that alternative
	development paths are possible within one scenario family.</td>

<p><a name="fig41"></a>The broad consensus among the SRES writing team is that the current literature
  analysis suggests the future is inherently unpredictable and so views will differ
  as to which of the storylines and representative scenarios could be more or
  less likely. Therefore, the development of a single "best guess" or "business-as-usual"
  scenario is neither desirable nor possible. Nor should the storylines and scenarios
  be taken as policy recommendations. The storylines represent the playing out
  of certain social, economic, technological, and environmental paradigms, which
  will be viewed positively by some people and negatively by others. The SRES
  writing team decided on four storylines - an even number helps to avoid the
  impression of a "central" or "most likely" case. The team wanted more than two
  storylines to help illustrate that the future depends on many different underlying
  dynamics; the team wanted no more than four to avoid complicating the process
  with too many alternatives. The scenarios cover a wide range of, but not all
  possible, futures. In particular, it was decided that possible "surprises" would
  not be considered and that there would be no "disaster" scenarios. The team
  decided to carry out sensitivity tests within some of the storylines by considering
  alternative scenarios with different fossil-fuel reserves, rates of economic
  growth, or rates of technical change. These sensitivity analyses resulted in
  groups of scenarios within a given scenario family and alternative scenario
  interpretations within a scenario group or family (see <a href="091.htm">Section
  4.2</a> below for a description of scenario terminology and taxonomy).</p>
<p>The titles of the storylines are deliberately simple - A1, A2, B1, and B2.
  There is no particular order among the storylines (they are listed alphabetically).
  <a href="#fig41">Figure 4-1</a> shows that the SRES scenarios build on the main
  driving forces of GHG emissions. Each scenario family is based on a common specification
  of the main driving forces.</p>
<p>All four storylines and scenario families describe future worlds that are generally
  more affluent compared to the current situation. They range from very rapid
  economic growth and technologic change to high levels of environmental protection,
  from low-to-high global populations, and from high-to-low GHG emissions. Perhaps
  more importantly, all the storylines describe dynamic changes and transitions
  in generally different directions. The storylines do not include specific climate-change
  policies, but they do include numerous other socio-economic developments and
  non-climate environmental policies. As time progresses, the storylines diverge
  from each other in many of their characteristic features. In this way they span
  the relevant range of GHG emissions and different combinations of their main
  sources.</p>
<p>After the basic features and driving forces for each of the four storylines
  had been determined, the team quantified the storylines into individual scenarios
  with the help of formal (computer) models. While the writing team and the modeling
  groups included experts from around the world, all six modeling groups are based
  in Europe, North America, and Japan. As indicated above, each model quantification
  of a storyline constitutes a scenario, and all scenarios of one storyline constitute
  a "scenario family." The six models are representative of different approaches
  to emissions-scenario modeling and different integrated assessment frameworks
  in the literature, and include so-called top-down and bottom-up models. The
  use of different models reflects the SRES Terms of Reference call for methodologic
  pluralism and for an open process (see <a href="146.htm">Appendix I</a>).
  The number and type of models chosen in the open process was on a voluntary
  basis. In January 1997 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working
  Group II Technical Support Unit (IPCC WGII TSU) sent letters to Governments
  asking for nominations of modeling teams to contribute to SRES and advertised
  in a number of scientific journals for modelers to participate in SRES. Six
  different modeling groups from Europe, North America, and Japan volunteered
  to participate in the formulation and development of the scenarios in response
  to the call. It is fortunate that they are from three different continents and
  also include different methodological approaches used in the literature to develop
  quantitative emissions scenarios.</p>
<div align="center">
  <p align="left">The six models have different regional aggregations. The writing
    team decided to group the various global regions into four "macro-regions"
    common to all the regional aggregations across the six models (<a href="#box41">Box
    4-1</a>).</p>

	    <p><b>Box 4-1: Four SRES World Regions </b></p>
        <p>The six modeling
	frameworks used to develop the SRES scenarios have different regional
	aggregations. The writing team decided to group the various global regions
	into four "macro-regions" common to all the different regional aggregations
	across the six models (<a href="#fig42">Figure 4.2</a>; see <a href="150.htm">Appendix
	IV</a>, <a href="150.htm#tblIV1">Table IV-1</a>). The individual scenarios were formulated with the
	respective regional aggregation of each model. Afterward, the input assumptions
	and results were summed to correspond to the four macro-regions:</p>
        <ul>
	      <li><b>OECD90</b> region groups together all member countries of the Organization
	  for Economic Cooperation and Development as of 1990, the base year of
	  the participating models, and corresponds to the Annex II countries
	  originally defined in UNFCCC (1992).</li>
          <li><b>REF</b> region consists of countries undergoing economic reform
	  and groups together the East and Central European countries and the
	  Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union; it roughly corresponds
	  to Annex I outside the Annex II countries as defined in UNFCCC (1992).</li>
          <li><b>ASIA</b> region stands for all developing (non-Annex I) countries
	  in Asia (excluding the Middle East).</li>
          <li><b>ALM</b> region stands for the rest of the world and corresponds
	  to developing (non-Annex I) countries in Africa, Latin America, and
	  Middle East</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In other words, the OECD90 and REF regions together roughly correspond
	to Annex I or industrialized (developed) countries (IND), while the ASIA
	and ALM regions together roughly correspond to the non-Annex I, or developing
	countries (DEV). Developing, or non-Annex I countries (i.e., ASIA and
	ALM), are sometimes referred to in the text as the "South" to distinguish
	them from the industrialized, or Annex I countries, of the "North" (i.e.,
	OECD90 and REF). A detailed description of each region is provided in
	<a href="149.htm">Appendix III.</a></p>

  <p align="left">In response to a number of requests from potential user groups
    within IPCC and in accordance with a decision of the IPCC Bureau in 1998 to
    release draft scenarios to climate modellers for their input in the Third
    Assessment Report, the writing team chose one model run to characterize each
    scenario family. Scenarios resulting from these runs are called "marker" scenarios
    or simply "markers." There are four marker scenarios, each considered characteristic
    for one of the four scenario families. The rationale and process for designating
    marker scenarios is discussed in more detail in <a href="096.htm#1">Section
    4.4.1</a>.</p>
  <p align="left">The SRES scenario quantifications of the main indicators (such
    as population and economic growth, characteristics of the energy system, and
    the associated GHG emissions) all fall within the range of studies published
    in the literature and scenarios documented in the SRES database (see <a href="034.htm">Chapter
    2</a>). Quantitative indicators form an important part of each scenario description.
    These indicators include gross world product, population, supply and demand
    for principal energy forms, energy resource characteristics, the breakdown
    of land use, and emissions of various GHGs. The scenarios are designed so
    that the evolution of their indicators over the 21 st century falls well within
    the range represented by scenarios from the literature and included in the
    SRES database (see <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a> and Morita and Lee, 1998;
    Nakic�enovic�, et al., 1998). More importantly, they correspond to the qualitative
    characteristics of the respective storylines. Also, they were revised iteratively
    within the six modeling approaches to achieve internal consistency on the
    basis of inputs from the entire SRES writing team and the SRES open process.</p>
  <p align="left">Each storyline was characterized initially by two quantitative
    "targets," namely global population (15, 10, and 7 billion by 2100 in scenarios
    A2, B2, and both A1 and B1, respectively) and global gross domestic product
    (GDP) by 2100 (in 1990 US dollars, US$550 trillion for A1, US$250 trillion
    for A2, US$350 trillion for B1, and US$250 trillion for B2). These quantitative
    targets guided the subsequent quantification of the SRES scenarios with different
    model approaches. Generally, the orders of magnitude of these original quantitative
    scenario "guideposts" are reflected in the final SRES scenarios (see <a href="091.htm#tbl42">Table
    4-2</a>) and have been adopted in a majority of SRES scenarios. Evidently,
    the quantitative characteristics of the four SRES scenario families comprise
    many more dimensions than this, in particular regional patterns, differences
    in resource and technology availability, land-use changes, non-carbon dioxide
    (CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>) GHGs, etc. These are discussed in the subsequent Sections.</p>
