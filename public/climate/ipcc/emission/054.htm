<p>Population aging has widely discussed implications for social planning, health
  care, labor force structural changes, and entitlement programs. As shown in
  <a href="#fig36">Figure 3-6</a>, percentage growth in the elderly age cohorts
  is predicted strongly by all projections. The figure shows the percentage of
  elderly age cohorts using the medium projection data. Importantly, it will be
  a continuous process over the entire 21<sup>st</sup> century, even though total population
  size is forecast in these cases to stabilize during the latter half of the century.</p>
<p>The detailed economic effects of such a profound and rapid change in social
  structure are not well understood (Eberstadt, 1997). The problem is considered
  below in the discussion of the impact of population dynamics on economic development.
  In short, conventional wisdom takes a more or less neutral view of the effect
  of population growth, including the impacts of aging, on the rate of economic
  growth (Hammer, 1985; Kelley, 1988; National Research Council, 1986). Lowered
  population growth rates (and concomitant aging) might have a beneficial effect
  on the economy through reduced youth dependency ratios, which result in higher
  savings rates (Higgins and Williamson, 1997). Also, population aging could reduce
  labor supply and thus reduce potential economic growth. Against this argument,
  labor scarcity induces higher wages that in turn are a powerful incentive to
  increase labor productivity. Increasing productivity (per capita economic output)
  would balance shortfalls from possible reductions in the labor force (Disney,
  1996). However, lowered fertility and mortality rates will also cause the elderly
  dependency ratio to increase, which might lead to a trend of lower savings,
  characteristic of elderly cohorts, which have a reduced incentive to save. In
  terms of public savings, without institutional reforms aging could eventually
  lead to severe strains on social security and health care programs supported
  by governments and thus to reduced governmental savings (US Council of Economic
  Advisors, 1997).</p>
<p>Interestingly, a case has been made that aging may have significant impacts
  on future CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions. The suggested mechanism for this relates to household
  formation rate (MacKellar <i>et al</i>., 1995). An aging population has a greater
  proportion of people in older age groups. Assuming age-specific household formation
  rates remain constant over time, as more people enter the older age cohorts
  the overall household formation rates will increase. This increase will be accompanied
  by a decline in the number of people per household (a process already observed
  in industrialized countries) and is related to reduced fertility rates. As small
  households consume significantly more energy per person than large households
  (Ironmonger <i>et al</i>., 1995), the various effects suggest CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions
  will increase with increased aging (MacKellar <i>et al</i>., 1995). Important
  uncertainties of this effect remain, not least because household formation rates
  of aging populations are not well understood.</p>
<h4><a name="anc4"></a>3.2.4.2. Urbanization</h4>
<p>Urbanization is also a strongly anticipated demographic trend. Since 1970,
  most urban growth has taken place in developing countries. It is caused by both
  internal increases of the existing urban population and rural-to-urban migration
  (UN, 1997b).</p>
<p>Urbanization, though, is not a rigorously modeled phenomenon within the projections.
  Essentially, future urban and rural growth and decline rates are simply assumed
  and applied to the projected population levels. Thus, the projections contain
  no explicit feedback mechanism from urbanization to population growth, even
  though urbanization is an important factor in fertility rate changes (urban
  populations generally have lower fertility rates than rural populations). Instead,
  urbanization rates are considered implicitly within the projections of future
  fertility. It is estimated that by 2010 more than half of the world's population
  will live in urban areas (UN, 1996).</p>
<p>Urbanization will lead to a rapid expansion of infrastructure and especially
  transportation uses (Wexler, 1996). In addition, urban households in developing
  countries use significantly more fossil fuels, as opposed to biofuels, than
  do rural households. However, the choice of fuel is predominantly an income
  effect rather than a function of locale (see Murthy <i>et al</i>., 1997), even
  within urban settings. Hence, urbanization exerts its influence on emissions
  primarily via higher urban incomes compared to rural ones. Generally, opportunities
  for higher income are considered an important driver of rural-to-urban migration,
  and so contribute to rising urbanization rates (HABITAT, 1996). Urbanization
  is obviously an important factor for future GHG emissions. </p>
