<h4>3.4.2.2. Industry and Agriculture<a name="anc1"></a></h4>
<p>Driving forces behind energy use and carbon emissions in the industrial sector
  include the state of economic development, consumption and trade patterns, relative
  costs of labor, capital, and energy, and availability of resources. In 1990,
  industry accounted for 42% (129 EJ) of global primary energy use. Between 1971
  and 1990, industrial energy use grew at a rate of 2.1% per year, slightly less
  than the world total energy demand growth of 2.5% per year. This growth rate
  has slowed in recent years, and was virtually flat between 1990 and 1995, primarily
  because of declines in industrial output in the REF region.</p>
<p>Energy use in the industrial sector is dominated by the industrialized countries,
  which accounted for 42% of world industrial energy use in 1990. Countries in
  the REF, ASIA, and ALM regions used 29%, 20%, and 9% of world industrial energy,
  respectively, that year. The share of industrial sector energy consumption within
  the industrialized countries declined from 40% in 1971 to 33% in 1995, which
  partly reflects the transition toward a less energy-intensive manufacturing
  base. The industrial sector dominates in the REF region, accounting for more
  than 50% of total primary energy demand, a result of the long-term policy that
  emphasized materials production and was promoted under years of central planning.
  Average annual growth in industrial energy use in this region was 2% between
  1971 and 1990, but dropped by an average of 7.3% per year between 1990 and 1995
  (IEA, 1997a; IEA, 1997b; BP, 1997).</p>
<p>The agriculture sector used only 3% of global primary commercial energy in
  1990. Unlike the other sectors, the REF region dominated agricultural energy
  use in 1990, using 34% of the total, followed by the IND (30%), ASIA (26%),
  and ALM (10%). Between 1971 and 1990, the average annual growth in primary energy
  used for agriculture was slower in the industrialized countries (2.2% per year)
  than in the three other regions, for which growth ranged between 4.5% and 4.8%
  per year. Trends in agricultural primary energy use changed significantly in
  the REF and ALM regions after 1990, with REF consumption dropping to an average
  of 10.6% per year and ALM consumption increasing to an average of 12.6% per
  year by 1995.</p>
<p>Energy use in the industrial sector is dominated by the production of a few
  major energy-intensive commodities, such as steel, paper, cement, and chemicals.
  Rapidly industrializing countries have higher demands for these infrastructure
  materials and more mature markets have declining or stable levels of consumption.
  Studies of material consumption in industrialized countries show increases in
  the initial development of society to a maximum consumption level, which then
  remains constant or even declines as infrastructure needs are met and material
  recycling increases. Absolute and per capita consumptions of some materials
  appear to have reached levels of stabilization in many industrialized countries,
  although this is not true of all materials (e.g. paper). Expressed as a function
  of unit GDP, material intensity generally declines after reaching a maximum
  (Williams <i>et al</i>., 1987; Wernick, 1996; WRI, 1997b; see also <a href="057.htm#anc1">Section
  3.3</a>). Although the use of all materials in developing countries will certainly
  grow, per capita consumption may not reach that in the industrialized countries,
  because more efficient processes and substitutes are available.</p>
<p>Carbon intensities with respect to GDP (CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions as a function of GDP)
  in the industrial sector have been relatively stable in most countries except
  for those that are rapidly industrializing (Houghton <i>et al</i>., 1995). This
  trend results from the changing economic structure, reduced energy intensity,
  and reduced carbon intensity of the fuel mix. A shift toward less carbon-intensive
  fuels took place between 1971 and 1992 in most industrialized countries, as
  well as in South Korea (Ang and Pandiyan, 1997; Schipper <i>et al</i>., 1997a).
  The industrial sector fuel mix has become more carbon-intensive in some developing
  countries, such as China and Mexico (Ang and Pandiyan, 1997; Sheinbaum and Rodriguez,
  1997), although a trend away from coal to other fuels has also occurred in some
  developing countries (Han and Chatterjee, 1997). The contribution of fuel-mix
  changes to CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions reduction has been small in most industrialized countries
  (Golove and Schipper, 1997; Schipper <i>et al</i>., 1997a).</p>
<p>Technical energy-intensity reductions of 1 to 2% per year are possible in the
  industrial sector and have occurred in the past (Ross and Steinmeyer, 1990).
  The annual change in energy intensity in the industrial sector varied between
  -0.1% and -6.6% per year for a variety of countries from the early 1970s to
  the early 1990s. Generally, electricity intensity remained constant and fuel
  intensity declined, which reflects the increasing importance of electricity
  (IEA, 1997c).</p>
