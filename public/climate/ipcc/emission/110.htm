<h3>4.4.10. Environmental Policies</h3>
<p>The SRES scenarios quantified emissions of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>, CH<sub><small>4</small></sub>, N<sub><small>2</small></sub>O, NO<sub>x</sub>, carbon
  monoxide, VOCs, SO<sub>x</sub>, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorochlorocarbons,
  hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. A detailed discussion
  of the trajectories and the most relevant driving forces is presented in <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a>. In all cases herein, future emissions of these gases are affected by
  environmental policies not related to climate-change concerns, as in the SRES
  Terms of Reference (see <a href="146.htm">Appendix I</a>). Efforts to protect
  the ozone layer will result in a significant decline in CFCs and some of their
  substitutes. Urban air quality concerns will have a significant influence on
  future emissions of indirect GHGs and of sulfate aerosols. As discussed in <a href="049.htm">Chapter
  3</a>, for sulfur emissions the SRES scenarios reflect the evaluation of the
  IS92 scenario series (Alcamo et al., 1995), the recent sulfur scenario literature
  (for a review see Grübler, 1998b), and sulfur control policies in the OECD countries
  and the beginning of similar developments in many developing countries (see
  <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Thus, a range of environmental measures is
  assumed in all four SRES scenario families, although the magnitude and timing
  differ as a function of the four different scenario storylines.</p>
<h4>4.4.10.1. A1 Scenarios<a name="44101"></a></h4>
<p>In the A1 scenario family, environmental policies are implemented as incomes
  rise and societies choose to protect environmental amenities. This first of
  all would concern water and air quality (health concerns), but also traffic
  congestion and noise, as well as land-use policies (preservation of recreational
  spaces). Economic instruments are assumed to be the preferred policy instrument
  in an A1 world. In some of the more "technology intensive" A1 scenario groups,
  cleaner energy systems and lower GHG emissions are achieved as a by-product
  of high economic growth coupled with rapid technological change.</p>
<h4>4.4.10.2. A2 Scenarios<a name="44102"></a></h4>
<p>Environmental concerns in their own right are perhaps the least important in
  the A2 world and they are mostly local in nature. For instance, no environmentally
  related barriers to nuclear energy development or environmental costs of fossil
  energy use are assumed. However, A2 scenarios include indirect control options
  for several GHGs that adversely effect local air quality. They also require
  vigorous environmental controls on pollutants that affect the availability of
  water, quality of soils, and productivity of agricultural crops to ensure food
  security is not jeopardized in a 15 billion person world. Hence, in terms of
  a number of traditional pollutants, A2 is far from an environmental "worst case"
  scenario, even if it generally has the highest GHG emissions.</p>
<h4>4.4.10.3. B1 Scenarios<a name="44103"></a></h4>
<p>The B1 scenario family assumes the most comprehensive environmental measures
  (see <a href="093.htm">Section 4.3</a>). Sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions
  decline with vigorous efficiency improvements and "dematerialization" of the
  economy. Economic structural change (toward services) and cleaner energy systems
  (electricity, gas, district heat) to improve urban air quality also result in
  lower emissions levels compared to other scenarios. Finally, additional "add-on"
  technologies, such as flue-gas desulfurization and de-nitrification equipment,
  catalytic converters, etc., bridge the transition gap before inherently clean
  energy systems (e.g. IGCC based on coal or biomass, hydrogen-powered fuel cell
  vehicles) come into use on a global scale. Environmental consciousness would
  also lead less-developed regions to take such measures earlier and at lower
  income levels than occurred in the history of presently industrialized regions
  (as indeed already actually occurs; see <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<h4>4.4.10.4. B2 Scenarios<a name="44104"></a></h4>
<p>In B2 scenarios, environmental concerns are prominent, but in contrast to the
  B1 world it is assumed that measures are implemented effectively only at local
  and regional scales. For instance, it is assumed that sulfur emissions would
  be progressively controlled and other local and regional problems concerning,
  for example, air quality, human health, and food supply would also be the focus
  of policies.</p>
