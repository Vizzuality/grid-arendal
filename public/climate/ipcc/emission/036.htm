<h1>2.2. General Overview of Scenarios</h1>
<p>The construction of scenarios to investigate alternative future developments
  under a set of assumed conditions dates far back.</p>
<p>Scenarios are one of the main tools used to address the complexity and uncertainty
  of future challenges. The first scenarios were probably designed to help plan
  military operations, often called "war games." Today, scenarios are used regularly
  by military organizations around the world for training and planning purposes.
  Military strategists and teachers often use very sophisticated computer models
  to develop scenarios for a multitude of different purposes.</p>
<p>Scenarios are also increasingly used by enterprises around the world for many
  commercial purposes. Perhaps the most famous example is that of the Shell Group
  in the wake of the so-called oil crisis, which used scenarios to plan the corporate
  response strategies (Jefferson, 1983; Schwartz, 1991). Today, the use of scenarios
  is quite widespread.. Many scenarios, particularly those developed for enterprises
  in the energy sector, are quantitative and include GHG emissions. Recently,
  the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) presented a set
  of scenarios developed in collaboration with 35 major corporations (WBCSD, 1998).
  The SRES scenario database documents a number of such scenarios that are in
  the public domain and have been published.</p>
<p>During the past three decades many global studies have used scenarios as a
  tool to assess future CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> (and in a few cases also other GHG) emissions. One
  of the first such global studies was <i>Energy in a Finite World</i>, conducted
  by the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) during the
  late 1970s (Häfele <i>et al</i>., 1981). Another influential series of scenarios
  that included the assessment of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions was developed by the World Energy
  Council (WEC, 1993). Recently, IIASA and WEC jointly presented a set of global
  and regional scenarios that were developed with a set of integrated assessment
  models and then reviewed and revised through 11 regional expert groups (Nakicenovic<i>
  et al</i>., 1998b). Another recent set of three scenarios, based on elaborate
  narrative stories that described alternative futures, was developed by the Global
  Scenario Group (Raskin <i>et al</i>., 1998) and received considerable attention.</p>
<p>Scenarios of future emissions played an important role from the beginning of
  the IPCC work. In 1990, the IPCC initiated the development of its first set
  of GHG emissions scenarios designed to serve as inputs to general circulation
  models (GCMs) and facilitate the assessments of climate-change impacts (Houghton
  <i>et al</i>., 1990). Two years later, in 1992, the IPCC approved six new emissions
  scenarios (IS92) that provided alternative emissions trajectories for the years
  1990 through 2100 for such radiatively active gases as CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> , carbon monoxide
  (CO), methane (CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>), nitrous oxide (N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), and sulfur
  dioxide (SO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) (Leggett <i>et al</i>., 1992). They were widely used by atmospheric
  and climate scientists in the preparation of scenarios of atmospheric composition
  and climate change (Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1995). In many ways, the IS92 scenarios
  were pathbreaking. They were the first global scenarios to provide estimates
  of the full suite of GHGs and at the time were the only scenarios to provide
  emissions trajectories for SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> . The IS92 scenarios are marked for reference
  in many of the illustrations herein that show the variation of emissions and
  their driving forces across the scenarios in the SRES database.</p>
<p>An important group of emissions scenarios included in this literature review
  was compiled from two international scenario and model comparison activities.
  This first group is from the IEW and involves structured comparisons of energy
  and emissions scenarios since 1981 (Manne and Schrattenholzer, 1996, 1997).
  The participating groups provide information for a standardized scenario poll
  from which the ranges and other sample statistics are reported for the main
  driving forces and emissions. The other group is the EMF (Weyant, 1993) and
  also involves regular scenario comparisons, in addition to standardized input
  assumptions, such as the international oil price or carbon emissions taxes.
  Both of these international scenario comparison activities provide a large share
  of the data for this scenario review and comparison. They include most of the
  global and regional emissions scenarios developed by formal modeling approaches.
  A large part of these activities is based on the use of scenarios for the purpose
  of climate-change research. A third scientific effort that involves scenario
  comparisons is the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme (ETSAP; Kram,
  1993) supported by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The ETSAP work involves
  scenario analysis by more than 40 scientific groups from about 20 countries
  using the same modeling approach.</p>
<p>In addition to the many scientific, governmental, and private organizations
  throughout the world engaged in scenario-building, some international governmental
  organizations regularly develop global and regional scenarios that include GHG
  emissions. For example, the IEA regularly publishes global energy scenarios
  that include CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions (IEA, 1998). Most of these scenarios are of shorter
  term and so are not suitable for the requirements of IPCC (see <a href="023.htm">Chapter
  1</a> for further details). Nevertheless, they are included in this assessment
  to facilitate a more comprehensive evaluation of emissions and their driving
  forces during the next few decades.</p>
<p>Some studies consider scenarios that involve explicit policies and measures
  to reduce emissions of GHGs or adapt to climate change. Such climate change
  intervention, control, or mitigation scenarios are an important tool for the
  assessment of policies and measures that would be required to reduce future
  GHG emissions. In this report, we use the terminology from the most recent IPCC
  evaluation of emissions scenarios (Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1995). Those scenarios
  that include some form of policy intervention are referred to as <i>intervention
  scenarios</i>, while those that do not assume any climate policy measures, such
  as the 40 SRES scenarios, are referred to as <i>non-intervention scenarios</i>.
  In some cases, intervention scenarios go even further and investigate more radical
  emissions reductions required to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of these
  gases (in accordance with Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention
  on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992)). In contrast, the SRES scenarios do not include
  any explicit additional climate policy initiatives in accordance with the Terms
  of Reference (see <a href="146.htm">Appendix I</a>).</p>
<p>The SRES writing team used a general approach to identify intervention scenarios.
  According to this approach, a scenario is identified as an intervention scenario
  if it meets one of the following two conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it incorporates specific climate change targets, which may include absolute
    or relative GHG limits, GHG concentration levels (e.g., CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> stabilization
    scenarios), or maximum allowable changes in temperature or sea level; and</li>
  <li>it includes explicit or implicit policies and/or measures of which the primary
    goal is to reduce GHG emissions (e.g., a carbon tax or a policy encouraging
    the use of renewable energy).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this classification system is only a first step, and further work
  is needed to refine this taxonomy.</p>
<p>Some scenarios in the literature are difficult to classify as intervention
  or non-intervention, such as those developed to assess sustainable development.
  These studies consider futures that require radical policy and behavioral changes
  to achieve a transition to a sustainable development path; Greenpeace formulated
  one of the first (Lazarus <i>et al</i>., 1993). This class of scenarios describes
  low emissions futures that sometimes, but not always, result from specific climate
  policy measures. Such sustainable development scenarios are also included in
  this assessment of the scenario literature. Where they do not include the explicit
  policies of the SRES criteria, they can be classified as non-intervention scenarios.
  However, there is a great deal of ambiguity as to what constitutes policies
  directed at climate change, as opposed to those directed at achieving sustainable
  development in general. Thus, some of these sustainable development scenarios
  are "non-classified" (i.e., the information available is insufficient to determine
  whether or not the scenarios included any additional climate policy initiatives).</p>
