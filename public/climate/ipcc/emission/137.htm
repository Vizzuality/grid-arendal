<h1><a name="anc2"></a>6.3. Greenhouse Gases and Sulfur Emissions</h1>
<p>The SRES scenarios generally cover the full range of GHG and sulfur emissions
  consistent with the storylines and the underlying range of driving forces from
  studies in the literature, as documented in the SRES database. This section
  summarizes the emissions of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. For simplicity, only these three
  important gases are presented separately, following the more detailed exposition
  in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5 </a>(see <a href="143.htm#tbl62b">Table 6.2b</a>
  for a summary of the ranges of emissions across the scenario groups in 2020,
  2050, and 2100).</p>

<p><a href="#fig65">Figure 6-5</a> illustrates the range of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions for
  the 40 SRES scenarios against the background of all the emissions scenarios
  in the SRES scenario database shown in <a href="029.htm#fig13">Figure 1-3</a>.
  For simplicity, only energy-related and industrial sources of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions
  are shown.</p>
<p><a href="#fig65">Figure 6-5</a> shows that the marker scenarios by themselves
  cover a large portion of the overall scenario distribution. This is one reason
  why the SRES writing team recommends the use of at least the four marker scenarios.
  Together, they cover a large range of future emissions, both with respect to
  the scenarios in the literature and the full SRES scenario set.</p>
<p>The SRES scenarios cover rather evenly the range of future emissions found
  in the literature, from high to low levels over the whole time horizon. In contrast,
  the distribution for emissions by 2100 of scenarios in the literature is very
  asymmetric. It has a structure that resembles a tri-modal frequency distribution
  - those showing emissions of more than 30 gigatons of carbon (GtC; 20 scenarios),
  those with emissions between 12 and 30 GtC (88 scenarios), and those showing
  emissions of less than 12 GtC (82 scenarios). As discussed in <a href="034.htm">Chapter
  2</a>, the lowest cluster appears to include many of the intervention scenarios;
  the second and third clusters are most likely the non-intervention cases. The
  lowest cluster may have been influenced by many analyses of stabilizing atmospheric
  concentrations. The middle cluster echoes the many analyses that took IS92a
  as a reference and is testament to the enormous influence of the IS92 series
  on emissions assessments in general.</p>
<p>The range of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> and other GHG emissions for the four marker scenarios is generally
  somewhat lower than that of the six IS92 scenarios.<sup><small><a href="fn7.htm#3" onClick="showFootnote(7,3); return false;">3</a></small></sup>
  However, the IS92 scenarios do not cover the "middle" range of emissions where
  the median and the average of all scenarios in the literature are situated.
  Adding the other 36 scenarios to the four SRES markers increases the covered
  emissions range beyond the IS92 series at the high end of the distribution but
  not at the low end. SRES scenarios stop short of the lower literature emissions
  because they are scenarios without additional climate initiatives (as per the
  Terms of References, see <a href="146.htm">Appendix I</a>).</p>
<p><a href="137.htm#fig66">Figure 6-6</a> illustrates the range of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions
  of the SRES scenarios against the background of all the IS92 scenarios and other
  emissions scenarios from the literature documented in the SRES scenario database.
  The shaded areas depict the range of the scenarios in the database that exceeds
  the SRES emissions range. The range of future emissions is very large so that
  the highest scenarios envisage more than a sevenfold increase of global emissions
  by 2100, while the lowest have emissions lower than today.</p>
<p>The literature includes scenarios with additional climate initiatives and policies,
  which are also referred to as mitigation or intervention scenarios. As shown
  in <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a>, many ambiguities are associated with the
  classification of emissions scenarios into those that include additional climate
  initiatives and those that do not. Many cannot be classified in this way on
  basis of the information available from the SRES scenario database and the published
  literature.</p>

	  increases to those that curve through a maximum and then decline. The
	  colored vertical bars indicate the range of the four SRES scenario families

	  on a subjective evaluation of the scenarios in the database by the members
	  of the writing team and is explained in <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a>.
	  It was not possible to develop an equivalent classification for land-use
	  emissions scenarios. Three vertical bars in Figure 6-6b indicate the
	  range of IS92 land-use emissions in 2025, 2050 and 2100. Classification
	  of land-use change emission scenarios similar to that for energy and

<p><a href="6-6.htm"><b><a name="fig66"></a></b></a><a href="137.htm#fig66">Figure 6-6a</a> indicates the ranges of emissions from
  energy and industry in 2100 from scenarios that apparently include additional
  climate initiatives (designated as intervention emissions range), those that
  do not (non-intervention), and those that cannot be assigned to either of these
  two categories (non-classified). This classification is based on the subjective
  evaluation of the scenarios in the database by the members of the writing team
  and is explained in <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a>. The range of the whole
  sample of scenarios has significant overlap with the range of those that cannot
  be classified and they share virtually the same median (15.7 and 15.2 GtC in
  2100, respectively), but the non-classified scenarios do not cover the high
  part of the range. Also, the range of the scenarios that apparently do not include
  climate polices (non-intervention) has considerable overlap with the other two
  ranges (lower bound is slightly higher), but with a significantly higher median
  (of 21.3 GtC in 2100).</p>
<p>The median of all energy and industry emissions scenarios from the literature
  is 15.7 GtC by 2100. This is lower than the median of the IS92 set and is lower
  than the IS92a scenario often (inappropriately) considered as the "central"
  scenario. Again, the distribution of emissions is asymmetric (see the emissions
  histogram in <a href="#fig65">Figure 6-5</a>) and the thin tail that extends above 30 GtC includes
  only a few scenarios.</p>
<p><a href="137.htm#fig66">Figure 6-6</a> shows the range of emissions of the
  four families (vertical bars next to each of the four marker scenarios), which
  illustrate that the scenarios groups by themselves cover a large portion of
  the overall scenario distribution. Together, they cover much of the range of
  future emissions, both with respect to the scenarios in the literature and all
  SRES scenarios. Adding all other scenarios increases the covered range. For
  example, the SRES scenarios span jointly from the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile to just above
  the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of the distribution of energy and industry emissions scenarios
  from the literature. This illustrates again that they only exclude the most
  extreme emissions scenarios found in the literature, which are situated out
  in the tails of the distribution. What is perhaps more important is that each
  of the four scenario families covers a substantial part of this distribution.
  This leads to a substantial overlap in the emissions ranges of the four scenario
  families. In other words, a similar quantification of driving forces can lead
  to a wide range of future emissions and a given level of future emissions can
  result from different combinations of driving forces. This result is of fundamental
  importance for the assessments of climate change impacts and possible mitigation
  and adaptation strategies. Thus, it warrants some further discussion.</p>
<p>Another interpretation is that a given combination of the main driving forces,
  such as population and economic growth, is not sufficient to determine the future
  emissions paths. Different modeling approaches and different specifications
  of other scenario assumptions overshadow the influence of the main driving forces.
  A particular combination of driving forces, such as specified in the A1 scenario
  family, is associated with a whole range of possible emission paths for energy
  and industry. The nature of climate change impacts and adaptation and mitigation
  strategies would be fundamentally different depending on whether emissions are
  high or low, given a particular combination of scenario driving forces. Thus,
  the implication is that the whole range needs to be considered in the assessments
  of climate change, from high emissions and driving forces to low ones.</p>
<p><br>
  The A1 scenario family explored variations in energy systems most explicitly
  and hence covers the largest part of the scenario distribution shown in Figures
  <a href="137.htm#fig65">6-5</a> and <a href="#fig66">6-6a</a>, from the 95th
  to just above the 10th percentile. The A1 scenario family includes different
  groups of scenarios that explore different structures of future energy systems,
  from carbon-intensive development paths to high rates of decarbonization. All
  groups otherwise share the same assumptions about the main driving forces (see
  <a href="135.htm#anc1">Section 6.2.3</a> and, for further detail, Chapters <a href="089.htm">4</a>
  and <a href="114.htm">5</a>). This indicates that different structures of the
  energy system can lead to basically the same variation in future emissions as
  generated by different combinations of the other main driving forces - population,
  economic activities, and energy consumption levels. The implication is that
  decarbonization of energy systems - the shift from carbon-intensive to less
  carbon-intensive and carbon-free sources of energy - is of similar importance
  in determining the future emissions paths as other driving forces. Sustained
  decarbonization requires the development and successful diffusion of new technologies.
  Thus investments in new technologies during the coming decades might have the
  same order of influence on future emissions as population growth, economic development,
  and levels of energy consumption taken together.</p>
<p><a href="#fig66">Figure 6-6b</a> shows that CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from deforestation
  peak in many SRES scenarios after several decades and subsequently gradually
  decline. This pattern is consistent with many scenarios in the literature and
  can be associated with slowing population growth and increasing agricultural
  productivity. These allow a reversal of current deforestation trends, leading
  to eventual CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> sequestration. Emissions decline fastest in the B1 family. Only
  in the A2 family do net anthropogenic CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from land use remain positive
  through to 2100. As was the case for energy-related emissions, CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions
  related to land-use in the A1 family cover the widest range. The range of land-use
  emissions across the IS92 scenarios is narrower in comparison.</p>
