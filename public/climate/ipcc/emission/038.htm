<h1><a name="anc1"></a>2.4. Analysis of Literature</h1>
<p>Individual scenarios are considered independent entities in the database. Clearly,
  in practice, individual scenarios are often related to each other and are not
  always developed independently. Some are simply variants of others generated
  for a particular purpose. Many "new" scenarios are designed to track existing
  benchmark scenarios. A good example is the set of IS92 scenarios, especially
  the "central" IS92a scenario, which was often used as a reference from which
  to develop other scenarios. A further consideration is that not all scenarios
  are created in an equal fashion. Some are the result of elaborate effort, which
  includes extensive reviews and revisions; others are simply the outcome of input
  assumptions without much significant reflection. Some are based on extensive
  formal models, while others are generated using simple spreadsheets or even
  without any formal tools at all.</p>
<p>Numerous factors influence future emissions paths in the scenarios. Clearly,
  demographic and economic developments play a crucial role in determining emissions.
  However, many other factors are involved also, from human resources, such as
  education, institutional frameworks, and lifestyles, to natural resource endowments,
  technologic change, and international trade. Many of these important factors
  are not documented in the database, and sometimes not even in the respective
  scenario reports and publications. Some are neither quantified in the scenarios
  nor explicitly assumed in a narrative form.</p>
<p>For this analysis, a simple scheme is used to decompose the main driving forces
  of GHG emissions. This scheme is based on the Kaya identity (Kaya, 1990; Yamaji
  <i>et al</i>., 1991), which gives the main emissions driving forces as multiplicative
  factors on one side of the identity and total CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> (or GHG) emissions on the
  other. It multiplies population growth, per capita value added (i.e., per capita
  gross world product), energy consumption per unit value added, and emissions
  per unit energy on one side of the identity, and total CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions on the
  other side (Yamaji <i>et al</i>., 1991)<sup><small><a href="fn3.htm#3" onClick="showFootnote(3,3); return false;">3</a></small></sup>;
  it is a specific application of a frequently used approach to organize discussion
  of the drivers of emissions through the so-called IPAT identity that relates
  impacts (I) to population (P) multiplied by affluence (A) and technology (T),
  (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a> for a more detailed discussion). The same
  approach can be used for other emissions such as SO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. However, the driving
  forces might be different for some species of anthropogenic emissions. </p>
<p>Apart from its simplicity, an advantage of analysis that uses the Kaya identity
  to decompose emissions into four main driving forces is that it facilitates
  at least some standardization in the comparison and analysis of many diverse
  emissions scenarios. This decomposition is very useful because it indicates
  where to seek differences in scenario assumptions that may account for differences
  in the resultant GHG emissions (Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1995). However, the identity
  is not used here to suggest causality. An important caveat is that these driving
  forces are not independent of each other; in many scenarios they explicitly
  depend on each other. For example, scenario builders often assume that high
  rates of economic growth lead to high capital turnover. This favors more advanced
  and more efficient technologies, which result in lower energy intensities. Sometimes
  a weak inverse relationship is assumed between population and economic growth.
  Thus, the scenario ranges for these main driving forces are not (necessarily)
  independent of each other. (See also the discussion of the relationships between
  the main scenario driving forces in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>.)</p>
<p>
  In the following sections, scenario ranges are presented for each of the four
  factors in the Kaya identity that represent the main (energy-related) emissions
  driving forces: population, gross world product, energy consumption, energy
  intensity (energy per unit of gross world product) and carbon intensity (CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>
  emissions per unit of energy). The ranges for CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions are presented
  first because they represent the "dependent variable" in the Kaya identity.
  These are followed by scenario ranges for the other factors in the decomposition
  that represent the "independent variables" (main emissions scenario driving
  forces) in the identity. This sequence was chosen to present the main scenario
  driving forces because it corresponds to their representation in the Kaya identity;
  it does not imply a priori any causal relationships among the driving forces
  themselves or between the driving forces and CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions.</p>
<p>Four complementary methods of analysis are used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>charts that show the distributions of scenarios in terms of their main characteristics
    and driving forces, including CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions, population growth, global GDP,
    energy consumption, energy intensity, and carbon intensity;</li>
  <li>histograms that show the range of values of main scenario driving forces,
    together with associated statistics such as the mean, minimum, and maximum
    values;</li>
  <li>"snowflake" diagrams, in which each of the axes represents the range of
    one of the key driving forces; and</li>
  <li>analysis of the relationships among the main driving forces of energy-related
    CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main findings of this scenario analysis are reported in Nakicenovic <i>et
  al</i>. (1998a).</p>
