<h3>4.4.6. Resource Availability</h3>
<p><a href="066.htm">Section 3.4</a> in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a> reviews energy resources and technologies. Here existing
  reserves (identified quantities recoverable at today's prices and with today's
  technologies), resources that have yet to be discovered or that need foreseeable
  techno-economic progress to become available in the future, and other occurrences
  of hydrocarbons in the Earth's crust are considered. Oil, gas, and uranium occur
  in deposits that need to be located, and the exploration for new resources is
  related to the needs for production over the next few decades rather than to
  a need to define what might ultimately be available for exploitation. Thus the
  ultimate resource base is uncertain. Coal, on the other hand, occurs in seams
  over wide areas and very little exploration is needed to give an estimate of
  potentially available resources. Whether or not they could be mined with given
  technologies and economics remains the most important uncertainty. Finally,
  new renewable sources of energy are dependent on ongoing technological development
  and cost reductions.</p>
<p>The conventional oil industry is relatively mature and the question is at what
  point in the 21<sup>st</sup> century will the current reserves start to run out. However,
  unconventional resources are also available - shale oil, bitumen, and heavy
  oil. These are starting to be exploited and they will extend current conventional
  oil reserves. The gas industry is less mature and much more remains to be discovered,
  particularly in areas that do not currently have the infrastructure to utilize
  gas and consequently exploration has been unattractive. Additionally, large
  amounts of unconventional gas have been identified, some of which are already
  in commercial production (e.g., in the US). Also, huge quantities of natural
  gas are believed to exist as methane hydrates on the ocean floor (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter
  3</a>) and it is possible that technology to exploit these will be developed
  at some stage. For uranium and thorium, the amount of exploration to date has
  been very limited, and hence the possibilities of discovering new deposits are
  enormous. It is likely that even a major expansion of the nuclear industry will
  not be limited by the amount of available uranium or thorium. With coal, the
  question is not one of discovery but one of economics, accessibility, and environmental
  acceptability.</p>
<p>To consider future resource availability as a dynamic process, however, does
  not resolve the inherent uncertainties in terms of future success rates of hydrocarbon
  exploration, technology development for either non-conventional fossil resources
  or non-fossil alternatives, or future energy prices. Therefore, these uncertainties
  are explored by adopting different scenario assumptions that range from low
  to (very) high resource availability (see <a href="097.htm#tbl44">Table 4-4</a>),
  consistent with the interpretation of the various scenario storylines presented
  in <a href="093.htm">Section 4.3</a>. This scenario approach is especially important
  given that hydrocarbon occurrences are the largest storage of carbon. IPCC WGII
  SAR (Watson et al., 1996) estimates the size of the total carbon "pool" in the
  form of hydrocarbon occurrences to be up to 25,000 GtC. How much of this eventually
  could become atmospheric emissions is at present unknown, and depends on the
  future evolution of technology, prices, and other incentives for future hydrocarbon
  use and their alternatives.</p>
<p>Given that long-term emission scenarios invariably rely on quantification by
  formal models, an important distinction needs to be made between assumptions
  concerning the ultimate resource base and projected actual resource use. Typically,
  assumptions on the ultimate resource base enter models as exogenously specified
  constraints - cumulative future production simply cannot exceed values specified
  as the resource base. Actual resource use, or what is frequently termed the
  "call on resources" conversely depends on numerous other factors represented
  in models, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Future price levels (either assumed as exogenous inputs or determined endogenously
    in the model).</li>
  <li>Assumptions on future technology improvements that either enable unconventional
    hydrocarbons to be "mined" economically or, conversely, that draw on non-fossil
    alternatives and/or non-climate environmental and social constraints (e.g.,
    limits on particulates and sulfur emissions or on land degradation and mining
    accidents).</li>
</ul>
<p>Their complex interplay results in scenarios of future cumulative resource
  use being the most appropriate indicator, as opposed to exogenously pre-specified
  resource-base constraints, especially in view of the multi-model approach adopted
  to develop the SRES scenarios. <a href="104.htm#tab410">Table 4-10</a> and Figures <a href="#fig48">4-8</a>
  to <a href="#fig410">4-10</a> summarize the results for the four SRES marker
  scenarios and of the ensemble of SRES scenarios for their respective scenario
  families and scenario groups (in the case of the A1 scenario family). It is
  evident that, in the absence of climate policies, none of the SRES scenarios
  depicts a premature end to the fossil-fuel age. Invariably, cumulative fossil-fuel
  use to 2050 (not to mention 2100) exceeds the quantities of fossil fuels extracted
  since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, even though the "call on" fossil
  resources differs significantly across the four marker scenarios. This increase
  is higher in the scenarios that explore a wider domain of uncertainty on future
  fossil-resource availability.</p>
<p>For non-fossil resources, like uranium and renewable energies, future resource
  potentials are primarily a function of the assumed rates of technological change,
  energy prices, and other factors such as safety and risk considerations for
  nuclear power generation. Generally, absolute resource constraints do not become
  binding in the marker scenarios or other scenarios. The contribution of these
  resources is substantially below the physical flows identified in <a href="066.htm#anc1">Section
  3.4</a>, and therefore results mainly from scenario-specific assumptions concerning
  technology availability, performance, and costs. These are summarized in <a href="105.htm">Section
  4.4.7</a>.</p>
<h4>4.4.6.1. A1 Scenarios<a name="4461"></a></h4>
<p>Energy resources are taken to be plentiful by assuming a large future availability
  of coal, unconventional oil, and gas as well as high levels of improvement in
  the efficiency of energy exploitation technologies, energy conversion technologies,
  and transport technologies. The grades of energy resources used in the model
  differ on the basis of extraction costs. When combined with the level of improvement
  in efficiency of exploitation technology (expressed as the rate of improvement
  in marginal production costs), the graded costs of energy-resource exploitation
  determine the energy production costs (prices) and hence the ultimate resource
  extraction quantities. For A1, large amounts of unconventional oil and natural
  gas availability were assumed. Cumulative (1990 to 2100) extraction of oil ranges
  between 15 and 30 ZJ in the A1 scenarios (A1B marker, 17 ZJ); for gas the range
  is between 23 and 48 ZJ (A1B marker, 36 ZJ) and for coal the range is between
  8 and 50 ZJ (A1B marker, 12 ZJ). Resource availability and reliance uncertainties
  are also explored through additional scenario groups. Three of these (A1C, A1G,
  and A1T) explore more extreme patterns of reliance on particular resources and
  technologies compared to the more "balanced" tendencies described in the A1B
  scenarios, including the A1B marker. As discussed in <a href="049.htm">Chapter
  3</a> and <a href="093.htm#1">Section 4.3.1</a>, this characteristic of the
  A1 scenario family stems from the interpretation of technological change and
  resource availability as being cumulative and path dependent.<br>

<h4><br>
  4.4.6.2. A1 Scenario Groups<a name="4462"></a></h4>
<p>Besides the A1B marker scenario group, alternative pathways unfold within the
  A1 family, according to diverging technology and resource assumptions (<a href="104.htm#fig48">Figures
  4-8</a> to <a href="104.htm#fig410">4-10</a>). Two of these groups (A1C and A1G) were merged into one fossil-intensive
  group (A1FI) in the SPM. The more detailed information on these two groups is
  presented here, in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a> and <a href="164.htm">Appendix
  VII</a> (see also <a href="fn5.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(5,1); return false;">footnote
  1</a>).</p>
<p>The coal-intensive scenario group A1C is restricted mainly to conventional
  oil and gas, which results in the lowest cumulative oil and gas use (15 to 19
  ZJ) of all scenarios; it is even slightly lower than in the B2 scenario, which
  has much lower energy demand. As such, the scenario illustrates the long-term
  GHG emission implications of quickly "running out of conventional oil and gas"
  combined with rapid technological progress in developing coal resources and
  clean coal winning and conversion technologies. As a result, cumulative coal
  use is very high - between 48 and 62 ZJ (median, 60 ZJ) between 1990 and 2100.</p>
<p>Conversely, oil and gas resources are assumed to be plentiful in the world
  of scenario group A1G because of the assumed development of economic extraction
  methods for unconventional oil and gas, including methane clathrates. Cumulative
  oil and gas extraction amounts to 76 to 88 ZJ, about twice as high as in the
  A1C scenario group. Mainly this reflects current perceptions that radical technological
  change needs to occur to translate a more significant portion of the resource
  base of unconventional oil and gas into potentially recoverable reserves, a
  development evidently also cross-checked by possible developments in non-fossil
  alternatives. Cumulative coal extraction in A1G is relatively low at 15 to 38
  ZJ (median, 19 ZJ) across the scenarios of this scenario group.</p>
<p>As a result of fast technological progress in post-fossil alternatives in the
  technology-dynamic A1T scenario group, the call on oil and gas resources is
  comparatively modest - cumulative extraction to 2100 ranges between 36 and 46
  ZJ, quite similar to the A1C scenario group. The main difference is that because
  of the improvements in non-fossil alternatives the call on coal resources remains
  modest - cumulative coal use of 4 to 12 ZJ (median: 10 ZJ) in A1T is the lowest
  of all the scenarios.</p>

<p><b><a name="fig48"></a></b>Resource availability assumptions for the A2-ASF world are generally rather
  conservative, essentially that current conventional estimates of petroleum resource
  availability are not expanded<a href="fn5.htm#29" onClick="showFootnote(5,29); return false;"><sup>29</sup></a>.
  Unconventional hydrocarbons, such as methane clathrates and heavy oils, do not
  come into large-scale use. As a result, coal resource use is the highest among
  the SRES marker scenarios. The ASF marker scenario quantification of oil, natural
  gas, and coal resource availability reflects the Rogner (1997) estimates for
  conventional oil and coal resource availability and the recent IGU (1997) estimates
  for conventional gas reserves (optimistic scenario, see <a href="049.htm">Chapter
  3</a>). Resource extraction costs in the ASF depend on the resource "grade"
  and vary from US$2.6 to 5.2 per GJ for oil (in 1990 dollars), from US$1.2 to
  4.6 per GJ for gas, and US$0.7 to 6.0 per GJ for coal.</p>
<h4><a name="4464"></a>4.4.6.4. Harmonized and Other A2 Scenarios
</h4>
<p>The primary energy structure of the A2 family scenarios is also reflected in
  the cumulative fossil fuel resource use, characterized by an increasing reliance
  on coal resources (see <a href="#fig48">Figures 4-8</a> to <a href="#fig410">4-10</a>). The cumulative
  oil use varies by a factor of two across the A2-family, between 11 and 24 ZJ
  (median, 18 ZJ; A2 marker, 17 ZJ). Cumulative gas use ranges between 20 and
  ZJ 36 (median, 23 ZJ; A2 marker, 25 ZJ). The higher end of the range of gas
  resource use occurs in the A2G-IMAGE scenarios, which explored the scenario
  sensitivity to assuming that a significant fraction of methane hydrate occurrences
  become technically and economically recoverable in an A2 world. Given the regional
  orientation of the A2 scenario storyline and the resultant quest for energy
  independence, the possibility of tapping even currently "exotic" fossil resources
  certainly merits such a scenario sensitivity analysis. The opposite end of the
  resource availability spectrum is explored in the MiniCAM scenarios of the A2
  scenario family. First, methane clathrates are assumed not to become available.
  As a result, the call on resources focuses on coal (A2-MiniCAM) or, in a scenario
  sensitivity analysis, more on unconventional oil and gas (A2-A1-MiniCAM). The
  range of reliance on coal resources is thus an inverse image of the range of
  oil and gas resource availability. Cumulative coal extraction varies between
  22 and 53 ZJ (median, 35 ZJ; A2 marker, 47 ZJ) across the scenarios of the A2
  scenario family. This picture mainly represents what used to be termed "conventional
  wisdom" in much of the scenario literature (including the previous IS92 scenario
  series). Importantly, while the probabilities of alternative developments of
  fossil and non-fossil resource availability cannot be assessed at present, the
  multi-model, multi-scenario approach described here demonstrates that the uncertainties
  in fossil resource availability might be much larger than assumed a decade ago.
  This finding also reflects the results of IPCC WGII SAR (Watson et al., 1996).</p>
<h4>4.4.6.5. B1 Scenarios<a name="4465"></a></h4>
<p> Assumptions on the fossil fuel resource-base used in the B1 marker scenario
  quantification are based on the estimates of ultimately recoverable conventional
  and unconventional fossil resources described in Rogner (1997). The capital
  output ratio of resource exploitation is assumed to rise with progressive resource
  depletion, but this is counteracted by learning curve effects in the marker
  scenario quantification provided by the IMAGE model. Regional estimates of the
  exploitation costs of conventional and unconventional resources of Rogner (1997)
  were used to construct long-term supply cost curves as of 1971. These values,
  rather than absolute upper bounds on resource base availability, define future
  resource availability in the IMAGE model. The supposed availability of huge
  non-conventional occurrences of oil and natural gas, with a geographic distribution
  markedly different from the distribution of conventional oil and gas, has significant
  implications for fuel supply and trade patterns in the long term. For coal resources,
  Rogner's (1997) estimates were also adopted; of the total of 262 ZJ, 58 ZJ belong
  to the categories of proved recoverable, additional recoverable, and additional
  identified coal resources. The production costs of coal were assumed to rise
  with increasing depth and rising labor wages, but these costs are largely offset
  by mechanization (in underground mining) and economies of scale (in surface
  mining).</p>
<h4>4.4.6.6. Harmonized and Other B1 Scenarios<a name="4466"></a></h4>
<p>The call on oil resources in the scenarios that comprise the B1 scenario family
  ranges between 11 and 20 ZJ, with a median of 17 ZJ (B1 marker, 20 ZJ). For
  gas the range is 15 to 33 ZJ (median, 20 ZJ; B1 marker, 15 ZJ), and for coal
  the corresponding range is between 3 and 27 ZJ (median, 11 ZJ; B1 marker, 13
  ZJ). An overview is given in <a href="#fig48">Figures 4-8 to 4- 10</a>.</p>
<h4>4.4.6.7. B2 Scenarios<a name="4467"></a></h4>
<p>The availability of fossil energy resources in the B2 marker scenario is assumed
  to be conservative, in line with the gradual, incremental change philosophy
  of the B2 scenario storyline. Consequently, oil and gas availability expands
  only gradually while coal continues to be abundant. Assumed oil and gas resource
  availability does not extend much beyond current conventional and unconventional
  reserves. Through gradual improvements in technology, a larger share of unconventional
  reserves and some additional resource categories are assumed to become available
  at improved costs over the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The availability of oil and gas, in
  particular, is limited compared to the estimated magnitude of global fossil
  resources and occurrences (Watson et al., 1996). This translates into relatively
  limited energy options in general and extends also to non-fossil energy options.</p>
<h4><a name="4468"></a>4.4.6.8. Harmonized and Other B2 Scenarios</h4>
<p>Alternative B2 scenario implementations assumed similar order of magnitudes
  of resource availability as the B2-marker scenario, except for B2 High-MiniCAM.
  The resultant cumulative resource use (1990-2100) ranged between 9 and 23 ZJ
  (median, 17 ZJ; B2 marker, 19 ZJ) for oil, between 18 and 27 ZJ (median, 21
  ZJ; B2 marker, 27 ZJ) for gas, and between 12 and 55 ZJ (median, 21 ZJ; B2 marker,
  13 ZJ) for coal (see <a href="#fig48">Figures 4-8</a> to <a href="#fig410">4-10</a>). The largest
  uncertainties relate to different interpretations of the more gradual changes
  under a "dynamics-as-usual" philosophy that characterizes the B2 scenario storyline.
  One group of scenarios (including the B2 marker) assumed a gradual expansion
  in the availability of conventional and unconventional oil and gas, whereas
  another group of scenarios adopted more conservative assumptions (akin to the
  A2 and B1 scenario families)<a href="fn5.htm#30" onClick="showFootnote(5,30); return false;"><sup>30</sup></a>.
  All else being equal, lower resource-availability assumptions for oil and natural
  gas lead to a higher reliance on coal and non-fossil alternatives and explain,
  together with technology assumptions, the differences in emissions between alternative
  B2 scenario quantifications discussed in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
