<h3><a name="anc1"></a>6.3.4. Nitrogen Oxides and Volatile Organic Compounds</h3>
<h4><a name="anc2"></a>6.3.4.1. Nitrogen Oxides Emissions</h4>
<p>The 1990 NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in the six SRES models range between 26.5 and 34.2 MtN,
  but not all the models provide a comprehensive description of NO<sub>x</sub> missions.
  Some models do not estimate NO<sub>x</sub> emissions at all (MARIA, MiniCAM), whereas others
  only include energy-related sources (MESSAGE) and have adopted other sources
  of emissions from corresponding scenarios derived from other models (i.e. MESSAGE
  uses corresponding AIM scenarios). Standardized (see <a href="115.htm#box51">Box
  5-1</a> on Standardization) 1990 NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in the SRES scenarios, measured
  as nitrogen, amount to 31 MtN (<a href="125.htm#fig59">Figure 5-9</a> in <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a>).</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a>, the volume of fossil fuels
  used for various energy purposes varies widely in the SRES scenario families.
  In addition, the level and timing of emission controls, inspired by local air
  quality concerns, is assumed to differ. As a result the spread of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions
  is largest within the A1 scenario family (28-151 MtN by 2100), almost as large
  as the range across all 40 SRES scenarios (see <a href="143.htm#tbl62b">Table
  6-2b</a>). Only in the highest emission scenarios (the fossil fuel intensive
  A1C and A1G scenario groups within the A1 scenario family and the high population,
  coal intensive A2 scenario family) do emissions rise continuously throughout
  the 21 st century. In the A1 ("balanced") scenario group and in the B2 scenario
  family, NO<sub>x</sub> emission levels rise less. NO<sub>x</sub> emissions tend to increase up to
  2050 and stabilize thereafter, the result of a gradual substitution of fossil
  fuels by alternatives as well as of the increasing diffusion of NO<sub>x</sub> control
  technologies. Low emission futures are described by various B1 family scenarios,
  as well as in the A1T scenario group that describe futures in which NO<sub>x</sub> emissions
  are controlled because of either local air quality concerns or rapid technological
  change away from conventional fossil technologies. Overall, the SRES scenarios
  describe a similar upper range of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions as the previous IS92 scenarios
  (151 MtN versus 134 MtN, respectively, by 2100), but extend the IS92 uncertainty
  range toward lower emission levels (16 versus 54 MtN by 2100 in the SRES and
  IS92 scenarios, respectively).</p>
<h4><a name="anc3"></a>6.3.4.2. Volatile Organic Compounds, Excluding Methane</h4>
<p>Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) arise from fossil fuel combustion
  (as with NO<sub>x</sub> , wide ranges of emission factors are typical for internal combustion
  engines), and also from industrial processes, fuel storage (fugitive emissions),
  use of solvents (e.g., in paint and cleaners), and a variety of other activities.
  As chemical reactivities of the various substances grouped under the NMVOCs
  category are very different, so are their roles in ozone formation and the (potential)
  health hazards associated with them. In this report, NMVOCs are discussed as
  one group. In 1990, the estimated emissions range was between 83 and 178 Mt
  NMVOC, which after standardization (see <a href="115.htm#box51">Box 5-1</a>)
  translates into 140 Mt NMVOC. As for NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, not all models include this
  emissions category or all of its sources; the most detailed treatment of NMVOC
  emissions is given in the ASF model.</p>
<p>A relatively robust trend across all 40 scenarios (see <a href="125.htm#fig510">Figure
  5-10</a> in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>) is a gradual increase in NMVOC emissions up to about
  2050, with a range of between 190 and 260 Mt. Beyond 2050, uncertainties increase
  with respect to both emission levels and trends. By 2100, the range is between
  58 and 552 Mt, which extends the IS92 scenario range of 136 to 403 Mt by 2100
  toward both higher and lower emissions (see <a href="143.htm#tbl62b">Table 6-2b</a>).
  As for NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, the upper bounds of NMVOC emissions are formed by fossil
  fuel intensive scenario groups within the A1 scenario family (A1C, A1G, combined
  into one fossil intensive scenario group A1FI in the Summary for Policymakers,
  see also <a href="fn7.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(7,2); return false;">footnote
  2</a>), and the lower bounds by the scenarios within the B1 scenario family.
  Characteristic ranges are between 60 and 90 Mt NMVOC by 2100 in the low emissions
  cluster and between 370 and 550 Mt NMVOC in the high emissions cluster. All
  other scenario families and individual scenarios fall between these two emissions
  clusters; the B2 marker scenario (B2-MESSAGE) closely tracks the median of global
  NMVOC emissions from all the SRES scenarios (see <a href="125.htm#fig510">Figure
  5-10</a> in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<h4>6.3.4.3. Carbon Monoxide</h4>
<p>CO emissions in 1990 are estimated to range between 752 and 984 Mt CO (880
  Mt CO after standardization) across the models used to derive the SRES scenarios.
  The same caveats as for NO<sub>x</sub> and NMVOC emissions also apply to CO emissions -
  the number of models that represent all the emission source categories is limited
  and modeling and data uncertainties, such as emission factors, are considerable.
  As a result, CO emission estimates across scenarios are highly model specific
  and future emission levels overlap considerably between the four SRES scenario
  families (see <a href="143.htm#tbl62b">Table 6-2b</a>). By 2100, emissions range
  between 363 and 3766 Mt CO, a considerably larger uncertainty range, particularly
  toward higher emissions, than in IS92, for which the 2100 emission range was
  between 450 and 929 Mt CO (see<a href="143.htm#tbl62b"> Table 6-2b</a>).</p>
<p>As for the NO<sub>x</sub> and NMVOC emissions discussed above, the highest CO emission
  levels are associated with the high-growth fossil fuel intensive scenarios (A1C
  and A1G scenario groups, combined into one fossil intensive scenario group A1FI
  in the Summary for Policymakers; see also <a href="fn7.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(7,2); return false;">footnote
  2</a>) within the A1 scenario family, and the lowest emission levels are generally
  associated with the B1 and B2 scenario families. However, inter-model variability
  is considerable, which indicates that uncertainties are equally large with respect
  to scenario driving forces (such as energy demand and supply growth) and other
  factors that influence CO emissions (such as local air quality concerns or technological
  change).</p>
