<h3>3.3.5. Conclusion<a name="anc1"></a></h3>
<p>The process of economic and social development depends both on the ability
  of the current lead countries in productivity to maintain their technological
  and institutional creativity, and on the ability of other countries to adopt
  leading-edge technologies and institutions or to develop their own. The crucial
  issues of "how much" and "what kind" of productivity growth can be addressed
  only by describing alternative scenarios of future development. To develop alternative
  scenarios it is necessary to recall the important qualitative relationship between
  demographic transition and social and economic development. Causality links
  could be in either direction, but the importance of the relationship is recognized
  in both theoretical and empirical studies. Hence, as summarized in <a href="051.htm#anc1">Section
  3.2</a>, this relationship should be incorporated into the SRES scenarios. Scenarios
  of accelerated rates of economic and social development should therefore be
  the scenarios with an accelerated demographic transition. This corresponds to
  a linking of high per capita development with comparatively low population levels.</p>
<p>There is a need to explore in particular pathways that close the development
  gap (see Parikh, 1992; Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1995). As the likelihood of zero
  or even negative productivity growth in the developed countries is low, closure
  of the development gap requires accelerated rates of productivity growth and
  the need to overcome or avoid setbacks in per capita income growth in many developing
  countries. Scenarios that explore this possibility will necessarily extend beyond
  the range of futures spanned by the IS92 scenarios, as well as beyond the range
  of the majority of the "conventional wisdom" scenario literature on the future
  of developing countries.</p>
<p>As a major part of the needed infrastructure to meet development needs still
  has to be built, the spectrum of future options is considerably wider in developing
  than in industrial countries. For instance, the technical possibilities for
  low emission futures in the developing countries are many. The extent of the
  spectrum of future options depends on the changes discussed in Sections <a href="051.htm#anc1">3.2</a>
  and <a href="057.htm#anc1">3.3</a>, but also on the outcome of crucial issues.
  These include political power structure, national governance and institutional
  structure; income distribution; cultural attitudes and consumption patterns
  (diets, housing, etc.), development of and access to modern technologies (energy,
  production, distribution, etc.), and the geographic distribution of activities
  (land use, urban settlement, transportation needs, etc.).</p>
<p>Particular sets of technological and behavioral options can be clustered into
  alternative, internally consistent packages to represent different choices over
  time and so define different development paths for any economy. Such clusters
  can give rise to self-reinforcing loops between technical choice, consumer demand,
  and geographic distribution, which create "lock-in" effects and foreclosures
  of options in technology and socio-institutional innovations. The time-dependent
  nature of these choices gives rise to bifurcations and irreversibilities in
  which the shift from one development path to another entails important economic
  and political costs.</p>
<p>Globalization of markets, technologies, and information networks may help accelerate
  productivity growth in the future. However, both economic and social losers
  could result from the globalization process. The financial instability during
  1998 has cast further doubt on the inevitability of global convergence as a
  standard model of political economy. Hence, a further important dimension of
  uncertainty to be explored in the scenarios is the degree of globalization or
  regionalization in economic, social, and technological development.</p>
<p>
  The various perspectives on economic history discussed in <a href="060.htm">Section 3.3.4</a> reveal
  several possible options for the future:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Perhaps the most extreme view may be that the development process is nearing
    completion in Europe, North America, and Australasia, so that the main prospect
    for growth is through the diffusion of existing best-practice technologies
    to the rest of the world.</li>
  <li>The nature of economic development may have changed significantly in high-income
    countries, with a new emphasis on services, quality, and information. Such
    development is hard to measure in material terms. Many writers refer to "dematerialization"
    and the emergence of the "knowledge-based" economy.</li>
  <li>The start of a new "Kondratiev wave" may be underway, to be revealed in
    the early 21<sup>st</sup> century in a surge of economic growth, with the massive development
    of high-technology industries leading to new products of increasing value
    and renewed opportunities for fast developmental catch-up.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, scenarios can span from low dematerialization to high dematerialization
  futures associated with a wide range of income levels. In the former, the shift
  toward more value-added products in industry would be compensated by rising
  labor productivity and hence lower product costs. Economic production remains
  material oriented. It may be a world with huge underground cities, air-conditioned
  tourist resort areas with indoor beaches, a significant fraction of people in
  low-density regions may fly their own airplanes, and robots may do housework
  in most homes. In the latter, much of the money flow would be associated with
  exchange of information and services. Industrial value added would be, to a
  large extent, generated from R&D and know-how, and less from increasing productivity
  in traditional industries. Educational, childcare, and medical services would
  make up a large part of personal expenditures. Already, all kinds of artistic
  and handicraft work have become part of the formal monetary economy, partly
  because of the booming world tourist industry. Much "economic growth" may revolve
  around the (re)distribution of scarce, positional goods such as space and valuable
  artworks.</p>
<p>Therefore, the task of future scenario development entails more than just the
  adoption of alternative quantitative assumptions. The overall context within
  which alternative assumptions on productivity growth or energy and materials
  intensity take place needs to be made explicit. This is simply because many
  key influencing factors (e.g., institutions) cannot be assessed quantitatively,
  or the relationship between factors is known only qualitatively. The development
  of alternative qualitative scenario "storylines" (see <a href="089.htm">Chapter
  4</a>) is therefore an important advance over previous IPCC scenario methodologies.</p>
