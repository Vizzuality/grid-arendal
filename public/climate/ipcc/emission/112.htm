<h2>4.6. A Roadmap to the SRES Scenarios</h2>
<p>In the preceding sections the characteristics of the SRES scenarios are summarized
  in terms of scenario driving forces such as population, economic development,
  resources, technology, land-use changes, and other factors. The scenarios were
  designed in such a way as to deliberately span a wide range, reflecting uncertainties
  of the future, but not cover the very extremes from the scenario literature
  concerning driving forces. A distinguishing feature of the SRES scenarios is
  that various driving-force variables are not combined numerically (or arbitrarily),
  but instead try to reflect current understanding of the interrelationships between
  important scenario driving forces. For instance, according to the literature
  review of <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a> it would be rather inconsistent to
  develop scenarios of rapid technological change in a macro-economic and social
  context of low labor productivity and stagnant income per capita. Scenario storylines
  were the method developed within SRES to help guide the scenario quantifications
  and to assure scenario consistency in terms of the main relationships between
  scenario driving forces.</p>
<p>The different quantifications discussed in the previous sections demonstrate
  that even if scenarios share important main input assumptions in terms of population
  and GDP growth, considerable uncertainty and scenario variability remains. For
  instance, features of technological and land-use changes can be interpreted
  quite differently within the framework of different models, even if they conform
  to the overall conceptual description and "scenario logic" described in a particular
  scenario family. In some instances the broad outlines of scenario driving forces
  were not followed entirely in particular scenario quantifications, but alternative
  scenario interpretations were submitted. These highlight important scenario
  uncertainties or express scientific disagreements within the writing team, as
  for future labor productivity growth and economic "catch-up" possibilities of
  currently developing countries. These alternative scenario interpretations and
  different model quantifications are presented here to reflect the SRES Terms
  of Reference for an open process and the use of multiple modeling approaches,
  even if this necessarily increases complexity and reduces simplicity and transparency
  in discussion of a large number of scenario quantifications.<br>

      <p><b>Box 4-10<a name="box410"></a>: Spatial Distributions of Economic Activities
	Based on Nighttime Satellite Imagery Data. </b></p>
      <p>Spatially explicit data on socio-economic activity is sparse. The reason
	arises mainly in that Systems of National Accounts and similar socio-economic
	statistics are available only at high levels of spatial aggregations defined
	by administrative boundaries (countries, provinces, or regions). As a
	result, gridded emission inventories largely rely on estimations of current
	population density distributions (e.g. Olivier et al., 1996) and modeling
	approaches to date have also relied exclusively on rescaling future socio-economic
	activities (economic output, energy use, etc.) based on current or future
	population density distribution patterns (see e.g., Sørensen and Meibom,
	1998; Sørensen et al., 1999). Population density is, however, not necessarily
	a good indicator for spatial patterns of socio-economic activities (Sutton
	et al., 1997). At higher levels of spatial aggregation, it is estimated
	that about two billion people remain outside the formal economy, most
	of them in rural areas of developing countries (UNDP, 1997). At lower
	levels of spatial aggregations, locations such as airports, industrial
	zones, and commercial centers have low resident population densities,
	but high levels of economic activity. Also, with increasing urbanization
	future population distribution will be markedly different from present
	ones (HABITAT, 1996). </p>
      <p>Night satellite imagery from the US Air Force Defense Meteorological
	Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) offers an interesting
	alternative based on direct observations. Early nighttime lights data
	were analyzed from analog film strips (Croft, 1978, 1979; Foster, 1983;
	Sullivan, 1989). Digital DMSP-OLS data have recently become available
	with global coverage (Elvidge et al., 1997a, 1997b, 1999). Nocturnal lighting
	can be regarded as one of the defining features of concentrated human
	activity, such as flaring of natural gas in oil fields (Croft, 1973),
	fishing fleets, or urban settlements (Tobler, 1969; Lo and Welch, 1977;
	Foster, 1983; Gallo et al., 1995; Elvidge et al., 1997c). Consequently,
	extent and brightness of nocturnal lighting correlate highly with indicators
	of city size and socio-economic activities such as GDP, and energy and
	electricity use (Welch, 1980; Gallo et al.; 1995; Elvidge et al., 1997a).</p>
      <p> <a href="112.htm#fig413">Figure 4-13</a> (bottom panel) shows a 1995/1996 night-luminosity map of
	the world developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
	National Geophysical Data Center. The map was derived from composites
	of cloud-free visible band observations made by the DMSP-OLS (see Elvidge
	et al., 1997b; Imhoff et al., 1997). The DMSP-OLS is an oscillating scan
	radiometer that generates images with a swath width of 3000 km. The DMSP-OLS
	is unique in its capability to perform low-light imaging of the entire
	earth on a nightly basis. With 14 orbits per day, the polar orbiting DMSP-OLS
	is able to generate global daytime and nighttime coverage of the Earth
	every 24 hours. The "visible" bandpass straddles the visible and near-infrared
	(VNIR) portion of the spectrum. The thermal infrared channel has a bandpass
	that covers 10<sup>-13</sup> µm of the spectrum. Satellite altitude is
	stabilized using four gyroscopes (three-axis stabilization), a starmapper,
	Earth limb sensor, and a solar detector. Image time series analysis is
	used to distinguish lights produced by cities, towns, and industrial facilities
	from sensor noise and ephemeral lights that arise from fires and lightning.
	The time series approach is required to ensure that each land area is
	covered with sufficient cloud-free observations to determine the presence
	or absence of VNIR emission sources.</p>
      <p>Dietz et al. (2000) performed illustrative simulations of possible future
	light patterns. Considering the high correlation between observed radiance-calibrated
	night satellite imagery data and economic activity variables like GDP,
	these simulations indicate future spatial patterns of economic activity.
	As a basis of the simulation, Dietz et al. (2000) rescaled present night
	luminosity patterns using global and regional GDP growth patterns of the
	preliminary A1B marker scenario reported in the SRES open-process web
	site combined with a simple stochastic model of spatial evolution and
	interaction. An illustrative simulation for the year 2070 is given in
	<a href="112.htm#fig413">Figure 4-13</a> (top panel). The resultant changes in spatial light patterns
	indicate socio-economic activities and provide useful information for
	infrastructure planning, such as expansion of gas and electricity networks.
	When combined with topographical information, like latitude, the data
	can also be used as input to climate impact and vulnerability assessments
	(e.g., extent of socio-economic activities that may be affected by sea-level
	rise).</p>

<p>To guide readers through the different driving-force assumptions that characterize
  the various scenarios, <a href="091.htm#tbl42">Tables 4-2</a> and <a href="096.htm#tab43">4-3</a>
  give an overview of the SRES scenario set. They classify scenarios that share
  important input assumptions (harmonized scenarios share global population and
  GDP assumptions) from scenarios that offer alternative quantifications. <a href="097.htm#tbl44">Table
  4-4</a> summarizes the main quantitative scenario descriptors for each of the
  four SRES scenario families of the "harmonized" scenario category. Here an attempt
  is made to link this information with the resultant scenario outcomes (emissions)
  that are discussed in more detail in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>, an additional, complementary scenario classification
  scheme to that used in this chapter is presented and focuses on driving forces.
  Scenarios are classified according to their cumulative carbon emissions (1990
  to 2100, all sources), the best single quantitative indicator available to compare
  emission scenarios that portray widely different dynamics and different combinations
  and magnitude of a variety of emission categories. Four categories of cumulative
  emissions, Low (<1000 GtC), Medium-Low (1100 to 1450 GtC), Medium-High (1450
  to 1800 GtC), and High (>1800 GtC) are presented. Table 4-20 links the scenario
  overview from <a href="091.htm#tbl42">Tables 4-2</a> and <a href="096.htm#tab43">4-3</a>
  with this information to guide readers through the differences in scenarios.</p>

  <a href="112.htm#tbl420">Table 4-20</a> indicates that in most cases there is an easily discernable direct
  connection between main scenario characteristics of a particular scenario family
  or scenario group and the resultant outcomes in terms of cumulative emissions.
  For instance, in the high GDP, high energy demand scenario family A1, all scenarios
  within the two scenario groups that are fossil fuel and technologies intensive
  (A1C and A1G combined into A1FI in the SPM) result in high cumulative carbon
  emissions. Conversely, cumulative emissions of the "efficiency and dematerialization"
  (without additional climate initiatives) scenario family B1 are generally in
  the "low" emissions category, but two model quantifications indicate medium-low
  emissions. For the scenario family B2, outcomes in terms of cumulative carbon
  emissions can also be related clearly to scenario characteristics. One group
  of scenarios (which includes the B2 marker) adopts an incrementalist perspective
  of technological change ("dynamics as usual") applied to medium levels of population
  and GDP (and resultant energy demand) and results in medium-low cumulative carbon
  emissions. Another group of scenarios explored the sensitivity of a gradual
  return to coal-based technologies (B2C-MARIA, B2-ASF), in one case combined
  with higher energy demand than in the other scenarios (B2High-MiniCAM); and
  results in higher cumulative emissions (Medium-High category in <a href="112.htm#tbl420">Table 4-20</a>).</p>
<p>Equally discernable in <a href="112.htm#tbl420">Table 4-20</a> is the wide range in cumulative carbon emissions
  that characterize the various scenario groups within the A1 scenario family.
  By design, the different scenario groups within this family explored the implications
  of different directions of technological change, ranging from carbon-intensive
  developments (A1C and A1G, combined into A1FI in the SPM) to decarbonization
  (A1T), with the "balanced" technology development scenario group taking an intermediary
  position. Different developments concerning fossil or non-fossil resource and
  technology availability in a less populated but affluent and thus high energy
  demand world (such as A1) can lead to widely different outcomes in terms of
  cumulative emissions, with a range as wide as that spanned by all four scenario
  families together. Technology can thus be as important a driving force as population
  and GDP growth combined. In other words, very different emissions outcomes are
  possible for future worlds that otherwise share similar developments of main
  driving forces such as population and economic growth and high rates of technological
  change.</p>
<p>However, areas of overlap and uncertainties of scenario outcomes (cumulative
  emissions) occur even for scenario quantifications that share otherwise similar
  assumptions for the main scenario drivers. Not surprisingly, differences in
  quantifications are largest within the A1 "balanced" technological progress
  scenario group, which includes the A1B marker scenario. Most model interpretations
  result in cumulative carbon emissions within the Medium-High category (1450-1800
  GtC). However, there are also scenario quantifications in which technological
  change tilts more in the direction of the A1C (A1-ASF) or A1T (A1-MARIA) scenario
  groups that favor fossil (coal) or post-fossil (nuclear, renewables, and biomass)
  technologies, respectively. This leads to very wide differences in cumulative
  emissions, from the Medium-Low through to the High categories. A similar range
  of scenario outcomes between Medium-High to High categories also characterizes
  the A2 scenario family that otherwise describes an entirely different world
  (high population and comparatively low per capita income compared to low population
  with high per capita income for the A1 scenario family; see <a href="097.htm#tbl44">Table 4-4</a>). Departing
  from the main scenario characteristics of the A2 scenario family in terms of
  population and income in direction of lower values (such as in the A2-A1-MiniCAM
  scenario) could even yield emissions in the Medium-Low category. Thus, the A2
  scenario family also indicates that a wide range of emissions outcomes is possible
  for any given development path of main scenario driving forces, such as population
  and income per capita.</p>
<p>Finally, the categorization of scenarios in terms of their (cumulative carbon)
  emission outcomes illustrates that similar emission outcomes could arise from
  very different developments of main scenario drivers. For instance, High category
  cumulative emissions could arise from scenarios of low population growth, combined
  with high incomes (and energy use) and globalized technological developments
  that favor accessibility and economics of fossil fuels (coal, unconventional
  oil and gas; e.g., A1C and A1G scenario groups). Alternatively, similar High
  category cumulative emissions could also arise from scenarios of high population
  growth combined with slower per capita income growth and more regionally oriented
  technology development trends (scenario family A2). A comparison of the B1 and
  A1T scenario groups (see <a href="#tbl420">Table 4-20</a>) also confirms this conclusion. Both scenarios
  explore pathways that reduce current income disparities between regions. They
  indicate that such a tendency does not necessarily lead to high emissions, but
  could be achieved with Low to Medium-Low category cumulative emissions (as scenario
  groups A1C and A1G also indicate that High category emission pathways are possible).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important conclusion from the SRES multi-model, open process,
  and the large number of scenarios it has generated is the recognition that there
  is no simple, linear relationship between scenario driving forces and outcomes
  or between emission outcomes and scenario driving forces. High or low population
  scenarios need not automatically lead to high or low emissions; similar statements
  also hold for economic growth and for closing regional income gaps.</p>
