<h4><b><a name="fig64"></a></b>6.2.3.2. Land-use Patterns<a name="anc1"></a></h4>
<p><a href="#fig64">Figure 6-4</a> illustrates that the land-use patterns diverge
  over time. It shows the main land-use categories - the percentages of total
  land area use that constitute the forests, the joint shares of cropland and
  energy biomass, and all other categories including grasslands. As for the energy
  triangle in <a href="135.htm#fig63">Figure 6-3</a>, in <a href="#fig64">Figure
  6-4</a> each corner corresponds to a hypothetical situation in which land use
  is dedicated to a much greater extent than today to two of the three land-use
  categories: 40% to cropland and energy biomass and 20% to forests at the top,
  60% to forests and 40% to other categories (including grasslands) to the left,
  and 80% to other categories (including grasslands) to the right.</p>
<p>In most scenarios, the current trend of shrinking forests is eventually reversed
  because of slower population growth and increased agricultural productivity.
  Reversals of deforestation trends are strongest in the B1 and A1 families. In
  the B1 family pasture lands decrease significantly because of increased productivity
  in livestock management and dietary shifts away from meat, thus illustrating
  the importance of both technological and social developments.</p>
<p>The main driving forces for land-use changes are related to increasing demands
  for food because of a growing population and changing diets. In addition, numerous
  other social, economic, and institutional factors govern land-use changes such
  as deforestation, expansion of cropland areas, or their reconversion back to
  forest cover (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Global food production can
  be increased, either through intensification (by multi-cropping, raising cropping
  intensity, applying fertilizers, new seeds, improved farming technology) or
  through land expansion (cultivating land, converting forests). Especially in
  developing countries, there are many examples of the potential to intensify
  food production in a more or less ecologic way (e.g. multi-cropping; agroforestry)
  that may not lead to higher GHG emissions.</p>
<p>Different assumptions on these processes translate into alternative scenarios
  of future land-use changes and GHG emissions, most notably C2, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>
  and N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O. A distinguishing characteristic of several
  models (e.g., AIM, IMAGE, MARIA, and MiniCAM) used in SRES is the explicit modeling
  of land-use changes caused by expanding biomass uses and hence exploration of
  possible land-use conflicts between energy and agricultural sectors. The corresponding
  scenarios of land-use changes are illustrated in <a href="#fig64">Figure 6-4</a>
  for all SRES scenarios. In some contrast to the structural changes in energy
  systems shown in <a href="135.htm#fig63">Figure 6-3</a>, different land-use
  scenarios in <a href="#fig64">Figure 6-4</a> appear to be rather model specific,
  following the general trends as indicated by the respective marker scenario
  developed with a particular model.</p>
