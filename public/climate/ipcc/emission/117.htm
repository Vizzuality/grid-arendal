<h4>5.3.1.1. A1 Scenario Family</h4>
<p>Rapid economic growth in the A1 family scenario leads to high energy demand
  and hence to a steep increase in CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions in the first decades of the 
  21<sup>st</sup> century. Structural changes in the energy supply become effective only in
  the longer term because of the inertia caused by long periods of capital turnover.
  With respect to alternative energy supply technologies, the A1B scenario group
  assumes a "balanced" approach, in which none of these technologies gain an overwhelming
  advantage. This scenario group includes the A1B marker scenario developed using
  the AIM model (Jiang et al., 2000). In addition to the A1 scenario group, variations
  that assumed fast advancements in specific energy supply sectors were explored
  (renewables, A1T; oil and gas, A1G; coal, A1C) (see <a href="089.htm">Chapter
  4</a>).</p>

<p>In the A1B-AIM marker scenario, the global average per capita final energy
  demand grows from 54 GJ in 1990 to 115 GJ in 2050 and to 247 GJ in 2100. Meanwhile,
  the final energy carbon intensity declines relatively slowly until 2050 (from
  the current 21 tC per TJ of final energy to 16 tC per TJ), which results in
  a steep increase in CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions in the first decades of the 21 st century.
  After 2050, when structural changes in the energy sector take effect, carbon
  intensity declines rapidly to reach 7.5 tC per TJ. This more than offsets growing
  energy demand from a contracting but increasingly prosperous population, so
  that carbon emissions decline between the years 2050 and 2100. Emissions peak
  around 2050 at a level 2.7 times (16 GtC) that of 1990 and fall to around 13
  GtC by 2100, which is about twice the current level (<a href="#fig53a">Figure 5-3a</a>). The total,
  cumulative 1990 to 2100 carbon emissions<a href="fn6.htm#4" onClick="showFootnote(6,4); return false;"><sup>4</sup></a>
  in the A1B-AIM scenario equal 1499 GtC (cumulative emissions from energy and
  industry only amount to 1437 GtC).</p>
<p>Energy-related carbon emissions vary widely across alternative A1 group scenarios.
  The smallest differences with respect to the A1B marker scenario (A1B-AIM) are
  in the A1B-MESSAGE (Roehrl and Riahi, 2000) scenario, which used harmonized
  input assumptions for population, GDP, and final energy use at the level of
  the four regions (see <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Resultant energy-related
  carbon emissions in A1B-MESSAGE closely match those of the A1B-AIM scenario,
  reaching 13.8 GtC by 2100, which indicates that energy supply technologies agree
  well between the AIM and MESSAGE models.</p>
<p>While still adhering to the "balanced" supply-mix assumption (see <a href="093.htm#1">Section
  4.3.1</a>), other scenarios within the A1 balanced group span a larger range
  of future emissions around the A1B-AIM scenario. In part this results from different
  assumptions on global and regional GDP growth and energy-intensity improvements,
  but also from alternative interpretations of how to translate the concept of
  a "balanced" pathway of technological change (as described in the A1 scenario
  storyline) into model-specific technology assumptions.</p>
<p>Two alternative A1 scenario groups, A1G (oil and gas) and A1C (coal), explore
  high-fossil futures and one group, A1T, explores advanced technology futures.
  A1G and A1C have been combined into one fossil intensive scenario group A1FI
  in the SPM (see also <a href="fn6.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(6,2); return false;">footnote
	2</a>). Energy-related carbon emissions vary widely
  across these scenario groups in conjunction with the scenario assumptions as
  to roles of different energy sources (<a href="#fig53a">Figure 5-3a</a>). The high fossil scenarios
  explore worlds that consume vast amounts of coal, or oil and gas, while with
  the advanced technology assumptions the role of fossil fuel declines strongly
  as nuclear and/or renewable sources are favored to supply the reduced final
  energy demand.</p>
<p>The A1 fossil scenarios have essentially the same population, GDP, and final
  energy demand as the A1B marker, but have a primary energy system that relies
  mainly on fossil fuels. Based on cumulative CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions, scenarios from the
  A1 fossil groups (A1G and A1C) fall within the high emissions category, with
  A1G-MiniCAM falling roughly in the middle of the range spanned by the six A1
  fossil scenarios (<a href="115.htm#tbl52">Table 5-2</a>). The primary energy
  system in the A1G-MiniCAM scenario emerges as a result of rapid increases in
  the efficiency with which fossil resources can be recovered, especially in the
  most expensive grades of these resources; unconventional resources play an increasingly
  important role toward the end of the 21st century.</p>
<p>These rapid technical changes, as well as relatively low rates of growth in
  the productivity of biomass and other non-fossil sources, imply a world that
  is heavily reliant on oil and gas. The three coal-based scenarios in this group
  (A1C-MESSAGE, A1C-MiniCAM, and A1C-AIM) assume rapid increases in the efficiency
  of synthetic fuel production, as well as relatively limited oil and gas resources.</p>
<p>Three advanced technology or A1T scenarios fall in either the "low" or the
  "medium-low" cumulative emissions categories (<a href="115.htm#tbl52">Table
  5-2</a>). The A1T-MARIA scenario (Mori, 2000) achieves very low carbon emissions
  through the combination of a low final energy use (54% of that in A1B-AIM) and
  a rapid increase in the importance of non-fossil energy technologies in the
  primary energy system (81% by 2100).</p>
<p>The resultant CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions range of all the A1 family scenarios is so wide
  that most of the remaining SRES scenarios fall within its bandwidth, from 4.3
  to 37 GtC in 2100. The total cumulative carbon emissions of the A1 family scenarios
  also span a very wide range, from around 1000 GtC to more than 2500 GtC (<a href="115.htm#fig51">Figure
  5-1</a>, <a href="115.htm#tbl52">Table 5-2</a>).</p>

<p>In the A2 scenario family, alternative energy technologies develop relatively
  slowly and fossil fuels maintain their dominant position in the energy supply
  mix. As oil and gas resources become scarcer and non-fossil alternatives remain
  underdeveloped, coal gains the leading role. Its share in the energy mix ranges
  from 45% to 52% in the harmonized scenarios (A2-ASF, A2-MESSAGE) and in other
  scenarios with similar input assumptions (A2-MiniCAM and A2-AIM).</p>
<p>Global CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions in the A2 marker scenario implemented using the ASF model
  (Sankovski et al., 2000) increase by more than fourfold over their 1990 level,
  to reach 29 GtC by 2100 (<a href="#fig53b">Figure 5.3b</a>). Total cumulative carbon emissions from
  the A2- ASF scenario amount to 1860 GtC by 2100.</p>
<p>In other A2 scenarios, CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions range from 17 GtC (A2G-IMAGE<a href="fn6.htm#5" onClick="showFootnote(6,5); return false;"><sup>5</sup></a>)
  to 33 GtC (A2-AIM) by 2100. The harmonized A2-MESSAGE scenario and the A2-MiniCAM
  scenario have very similar global CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions as compared to the marker. Slightly
  higher emissions, primarily caused by higher primary energy use, are generated
  in the A2-AIM scenario. Unlike the rest of the A2 family scenarios, the A2G-IMAGE
  scenario yields constant emissions after 2050. This emission trajectory is explained
  by the combination of a lower energy demand and a larger share of natural gas
  in the energy supply mix (see <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a> for more details).
  Total cumulative carbon emissions in the A2 scenario group range between 1710
  and 1860 GtC by 2100.</p>
<p>A variant of the A2 storyline, developed with the MiniCAM model (A2-A1-MiniCAM),
  explores a world in which economic growth and population follow a "hybrid" trajectory,
  which have traits of both the A2 and A1 storylines. As described in <a href="101.htm#box46">Box
  4-6</a>, A2-A1-MiniCAM has a lower population than other scenarios of the A2
  family, and a slower rate of economic growth in the first half of the 21st century.
  These in turn limit the growth in final energy demand until after the onset
  of rapid economic growth around 2050. Emissions also rise rapidly during the
  post-2050 period, as the large growth in energy consumption results mostly from
  coal, oil, and gas.</p>
<p>Two out of the six A2-family scenarios, A2-ASF and A2-AIM, fall into the "high"
  cumulative CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions category. Three scenarios, A2-MESSAGE, A2-IMAGE, and
  A2-MiniCAM, belong to the "medium-high" category, and only the A2-A1- MiniCAM
  scenario with its drastically different assumptions about key driving forces
  falls in the "medium-low" category.</p>
