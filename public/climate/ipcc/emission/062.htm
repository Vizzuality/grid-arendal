<h4><a name="anc1"></a>3.3.4.6. Do the Poor Get Richer and the Rich Slow Down?</h4>
<p>Neoclassic growth theory suggests that different capital and labor productivities
  across countries lead to differential productivity growth rates and hence to
  conditional convergence across different economies. Rostow (1990) coined the
  term that the "poor get richer and the rich slow down." The convergence theorem
  of neoclassic theory arises from diminishing returns on capital. Economies that
  tend to have less capital per worker tend to have higher rates of return and
  hence higher growth rates (see Abramovitz, 1986). Conversely, economies with
  high capital intensity (which, because of the relationship between capital intensity
  and productivity, are closer to or at the productivity frontier) tend to have
  lower growth rates. Evidently, economies differ in more respects than their
  capital intensities, and hence even neoclassic theory only postulates conditional
  convergence (after accounting for all other factors).</p>
<p>The neoclassic concept of capital is usefully extended to include also human
  capital in the form of education, experience, and health (see, e.g., Lucas,
  1988; Barro and Sala-I- Martin, 1995). Thus, additional convergence potentials
  accrue for economies with a proportionally higher ratio of human-to-physical
  capital. Equally, the generation and adoption of new technologies is facilitated
  by high human capital. Yet, even with the inclusion of human capital, long-term
  per capita growth must eventually cease in the absence of continuous improvements
  in technology. This cessation, however, mostly affects economies at the productivity
  frontier and not those that lag behind. For the latter, both theory and empirical
  evidence seem, all else being equal, to indicate conditional convergence (i.e.,
  "the poor can get richer."). The ceteris paribus condition is an important qualifier
  for the convergence theorem. Evidently, the potential for conditional convergence
  and economic catch-up cannot be realized in an economy struck by civil war,
  poor institutions, or even low savings rates (related to the demographic transition
  discussed in <a href="051.htm#anc1">Section 3.2</a>). The recent Asian financial
  crisis also demonstrated that differential capital productivity indeed can lead
  to vast influxes of capital into developing economies, and appropriate assimilative
  capacities (banking systems, functioning legal system, institutions, etc.) need
  to be in place to use such capital flows productively (World Bank, 1998b).</p>

<p>In terms of a functional relationship, therefore, per capita GDP growth rates
  are expected to be higher for economies with low per capita GDP levels. Notwithstanding
  many frustrating setbacks, such as the recent "lost decade" for economic catch-up
  in Africa and Latin America, empirical data indicate that the convergence theorem
  holds. <a href="#fig311">Figure 3-11</a> illustrates some empirical evidence
  put forward by Barro (1997) based on the experiences of some 100 countries in
  the period 1960 to 1985.</p>
<p>Similar convergence trends have also been identified <i>within</i> economies.
  For instance, Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995) find significant convergence trends
  across individual states in the USA, between prefectures in Japan, and between
  different regions in Europe. Barro (1997) concludes in his analysis that the
  conditional convergence rates across these countries is statistically highly
  significant, and proceeds rather slowly at 2-3% per year. It may take an economy
  27 years to reach 50% of steady-state levels (the productivity frontier) and
  some 90 years to achieve 90% of that level. Based on this convergence criterion
  alone, it may well take a century (given all other factors set favorably) for
  a poor economy to catch-up to levels that prevail in the industrial countries
  today, never mind the levels that might prevail in affluent countries 100 years
  in the future. Barro's analysis indicates a threshold GDP per capita level at
  approximately US$3000 per year. Below that level, additional productivity growth
  potentials result from catch-up; beyond that level, higher per capita GDP levels
  make further productivity growth ever more difficult to achieve (as indicated
  by the negative values of the residual GDP per capita growth rates in <a href="#fig311">Figure
  3-11</a>).</p>
<p>Given the wide range in historical experiences and the slow rates of convergence
  suggested by neoclassic growth theory, it is not surprising that the available
  scenario literature takes a cautious view on economic catch-up. Whereas convergence
  tendencies are generally evident in scenario assumptions (see the significantly
  higher GDP per capita growth rates for currently developing countries compared
  to industrial countries in <a href="059.htm#fig310">Figure 3-10</a>), long-term
  convergence rates are low. For instance, from all six IS92 scenarios only one
  (IS92e) assumes that developing countries outside China may eventually reach
  present OECD income levels, and even in this most optimistic scenario it is
  assumed to occur only after 2080 (Pepper et al., 1992). Even in this convergence
  scenario per capita income differences remain large - a factor of five by the
  end of the simulation horizon (US$31,000 per capita GDP per year in developing
  countries outside China versus US$150,000 OECD average). In an influential critique
  Parikh (1992) referred to the IS92 scenario series as being "unfair to the South,"
  a point also taken up in the evaluation of the IS92 scenarios. Alcamo et al.
  (1995) concluded that new IPCC scenarios "will be needed for exploring a wide
  variety of economic development pathways, for example, a closing of the income
  gap between industrial and developing countries." With a few notable exceptions
  (e.g., the scenario developed by Lazarus <i>et al</i>. (1993) and the Case C
  scenarios presented in IIASA-World Energy Conference (WEC) (IIASA-WEC, 1995)
  and Nakic´enovic´ <i>et al</i>. (1998a)), the challenge to explore conditions
  and pathways that close the income gap between developing and industrial regions
  appears to have been insufficiently taken up in the scenario literature, a gap
  this report aims to begin to fill. <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a> describes
  two scenarios in which the ratios between regions of GDP/capita decline and
  the absolute differences increase.</p>
