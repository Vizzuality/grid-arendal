<h3>4.3.2. A2 Storyline and Scenario Family</h3>
<p>The A2 scenario family represents a differentiated world. Compared to the A1
  storyline it is characterized by lower trade flows, relatively slow capital
  stock turnover, and slower technological change. The A2 world "consolidates"
  into a series of economic regions. Self-reliance in terms of resources and less
  emphasis on economic, social, and cultural interactions between regions are
  characteristic for this future. Economic growth is uneven and the income gap
  between now-industrialized and developing parts of the world does not narrow,
  unlike in the A1 and B1 scenario families.</p>
<p>The A2 world has less international cooperation than the A1 or B1 worlds. People,
  ideas, and capital are less mobile so that technology diffuses more slowly than
  in the other scenario families. International disparities in productivity, and
  hence income per capita, are largely maintained or increased in absolute terms.
  With the emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline relatively
  slowly, which makes the A2 population the largest among the storylines (15 billion
  by 2100). Global average per capita income in A2 is low relative to other storylines
  (especially A1 and B1), reaching about US$7200 per capita by 2050 and US$16,000
  in 2100. By 2100 the global GDP reaches about US$250 trillion. Technological
  change in the A2 scenario world is also more heterogeneous than that in A1.
  It is more rapid than average in some regions and slower in others, as industry
  adjusts to local resource endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions
  with abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource-intensive economies,
  while those poor in resources place a very high priority on minimizing import
  dependence through technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and
  make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions is determined
  primarily by resource availability. High-income but resource-poor regions shift
  toward advanced post-fossil technologies (renewables or nuclear), while low-income
  resource-rich regions generally rely on older fossil technologies. Final energy
  intensities in A2 decline with a pace of 0.5 to 0.7% per year.</p>
<p>In the A2 world, social and political structures diversify; some regions move
  toward stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others
  move toward "leaner" government and more heterogeneous income distributions.
  With substantial food requirements, agricultural productivity in the A2 world
  is one of the main focus areas for innovation and research, development, and
  deployment (RD&D) efforts, and environmental concerns. Initial high levels of
  soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through the local development
  of more sustainable high-yield agriculture. Although attention is given to potential
  local and regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. Global
  environmental concerns are relatively weak, although attempts are made to bring
  regional and local pollution under control and to maintain environmental amenities.</p>
<p>As in other SRES storylines, the intention in this storyline is not to imply
  that the underlying dynamics of A2 are either good or bad. The literature suggests
  that such a world could have many positive aspects from the current perspective,
  such as the increasing tendency toward cultural pluralism with mutual acceptance
  of diversity and fundamental differences. Various scenarios from the literature
  may be grouped under this scenario family. For example, "New Empires" by Schwartz
  (1991) is an example of a society in which most nations protect their threatened
  cultural identities. Some regions might achieve relative stability while others
  suffer under civil disorders (Schwartz, 1996). In "European Renaissance" (de
  Jong and Zalm, 1991; CPB, 1992), economic growth slows down because of a strengthening
  of protectionist trade blocks. In "Imperial Harmonization" (Lawrence et al.,
  1997), major economic blocs impose standards and regulations on smaller countries.
  The Shell scenario "Global Mercantilism" (1989, see Schwartz, 1991) explores
  the possibility of regional spheres of influence, whereas "Barricades" (Shell,
  1993) reflects resistance to globalization and liberalization of markets. Noting
  the tensions that arise as societies adopt western technology without western
  culture, Huntington (1996) suggests that conflicts between civilizations rather
  than globalizing economies may determine the geo-political future of the world.</p>
<h3><a name="1"></a>4.3.3. B1 Storyline and Scenario Family</h3>
<p>The central elements of the B1 future are a high level of environmental and
  social consciousness combined with a globally coherent approach to a more sustainable
  development. Heightened environmental consciousness might be brought about by
  clear evidence that impacts of natural resource use, such as deforestation,
  soil depletion, over-fishing, and global and regional pollution, pose a serious
  threat to the continuation of human life on Earth. In the B1 storyline, governments,
  businesses, the media, and the public pay increased attention to the environmental
  and social aspects of development. Technological change plays an important role.
  At the same time, however, the storyline does not include any climate policies,
  to reflect the SRES terms of reference. Nevertheless, such a possible future
  cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>The "Conventional Worlds-Policy Reform" scenario by Gallopin et al. (1997)
  is a good example of such a future, although it includes climate policies. In
  "Ecotopia," Wilkerson (1995) describes a reaction to early decades of crime
  and chaos, in which community values triumph over individualist ones and lead
  to resource-friendly lifestyles based on clean and light technologies. This
  scenario includes a voluntary embrace of cohesion, cooperation, and reduced
  consumption, backed by legislation and even corporate policies (Wilkerson, 1995).
  In the normative "Human Development Success" (Glenn and Gordon, 1997), the world
  achieves an environmentally sustainable economy by 2050, primarily through education
  to develop human potential. In "Balanced Future" (de Jong and Zalm, 1991; CPB,
  1992), economic equilibrium and innovation lead to sustainable development.
  The "Ecologically Driven" scenarios by WEC (1993) and IIASA-WEC (Nakic�enovic�
  et al., 1998) - with accelerated efficiency improvements in resource use - share
  several of the characteristics of the B1 type of future, as does the egalitarian
  utopia scenario in the TARGETS approach (Rotmans and de Vries, 1997).</p>
<p>Many additional scenarios in the literature could be seen as examples of this
  family, but may describe the changes as more fundamental than those of B1. The
  "Transformed World" of Hammond (1998), based on the "Great Transitions" scenario
  of Gallopin et al. (1997), stresses the role of global technological innovation
  in addition to enlightened corporate actions, government policies, and empowerment
  of local groups. In "Shared Space" by the Millennium Institute (Glenn and Gordon,
  1997), resources are shared more equitably to the benefit of all and the greater
  safety of humanity. The Shell scenario "Sustainable World" (1989, see Schwartz,
  1991) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development scenarios (WBCSD,
  1998), "Geopolity" and "Jazz," examine sustainable futures.</p>
<p>Economic development in B1 is balanced, and efforts to achieve equitable income
  distribution are effective. As in A1, the B1 storyline describes a fast-changing
  and convergent world, but the priorities differ. Whereas the A1 world invests
  its gains from increased productivity and know-how primarily in further economic
  growth, the B1 world invests a large part of its gains in improved efficiency
  of resource use ("dematerialization"), equity, social institutions, and environmental
  protection.</p>
<p>A strong welfare net prevents social exclusion on the basis of poverty. However,
  counter-currents may develop and in some places people may not conform to the
  main social and environmental intentions of the mainstream in this scenario
  family. Massive income redistribution and presumably high taxation levels may
  adversely affect the economic efficiency and functioning of world markets.</p>
<p>Particular effort is devoted to increases in resource efficiency to achieve
  the goals stated above. Incentive systems, combined with advances in international
  institutions, permit the rapid diffusion of cleaner technology. To this end,
  R&D is also enhanced, together with education and the capacity building for
  clean and equitable development. Organizational measures are adopted to reduce
  material wastage by maximizing reuse and recycling. The combination of technical
  and organizational change yields high levels of material and energy saving,
  as well as reductions in pollution. Labor productivity also improves as a by-product
  of these efforts. Alternative scenarios considered within the B1 family include
  different rates of GDP growth and dematerialization (e.g., decline in energy
  and material intensities).</p>
<p>The demographic transition to low mortality and fertility occurs at the same
  rate as in A1, but for different reasons as it is motivated partly by social
  and environmental concerns. Global population reaches nine billion by 2050 and
  declines to about seven billion by 2100. This is a world with high levels of
  economic activity (a global GDP of around US$350 trillion by 2100) and significant
  and deliberate progress toward international and national income equality. Global
  income per capita in 2050 averages US$13,000, one-third lower than in A1. A
  higher proportion of this income is spent on services rather than on material
  goods, and on quality rather than quantity, because the emphasis on material
  goods is less and also resource prices are increased by environmental taxation.</p>
<p>The B1 storyline sees a relatively smooth transition to alternative energy
  systems as conventional oil and gas resources decline. There is extensive use
  of conventional and unconventional gas as the cleanest fossil resource during
  the transition, but the major push is toward post-fossil technologies, driven
  in large part by environmental concerns.</p>
<p>Given the high environmental consciousness and institutional effectiveness
  in the B1 storyline, environmental quality is high, as most potentially negative
  environmental aspects of rapid development are anticipated and effectively dealt
  with locally, nationally, and internationally. For example, transboundary air
  pollution (acid rain) is basically eliminated in the long term. Land use is
  managed carefully to counteract the impacts of activities potentially damaging
  to the environment. Cities are compact and designed for public and non-motorized
  transport, with suburban developments tightly controlled. Strong incentives
  for low-input, low-impact agriculture, along with maintenance of large areas
  of wilderness, contribute to high food prices with much lower levels of meat
  consumption than those in A1. These proactive local and regional environmental
  measures and policies also lead to relatively low GHG emissions, even in the
  absence of explicit interventions to mitigate climate change.</p>
