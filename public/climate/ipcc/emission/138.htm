<h4>6.3.1.2. Four Categories of Cumulative Emissions<a name="anc1"></a></h4>
<p>This comparison of some of the SRES scenario characteristics implies that similar
  future emissions can result from very different socio-economic developments,
  and similar developments of driving forces can result in different future emissions.
  Uncertainties in the future development of key emission driving forces create
  large uncertainties in future emissions, even within the same socio-economic
  development paths. Therefore, emissions from each scenario family overlap substantially
  with emissions from other scenario families. <a href="137.htm#fig66">Figure 6-6</a>
  shows this for CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions. For example, comparison of the A1B and B2 marker
  scenarios indicates that they have similar emissions of about 13.5 and 13.7
  GtC by 2100, respectively. The dynamics of the paths, however, are different
  so that they have different cumulative CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions and different emissions
  of other GHG gases and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> .</p>
<p>To facilitate comparisons of emissions and their driving forces across the
  scenarios, the writing team grouped them into four categories of cumulative
  emissions between 1990 and 2100. However, any categorization of scenarios based
  on emissions of multiple gases is quite difficult. <a href="#fig67">Figure
  6-7</a> shows total CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from all sources (from <a href="137.htm#fig66">Figures
  6-6a and b</a>). Most of the scenarios are shown aggregated into seven groups,
  the four A1 groups and the other three families. The scenarios that remain outside
  the seven groups adopted alternative interpretations of the four scenario storylines.
  The emission trajectories ("bands") of the seven groups display different dynamics,
  from monotonic increases to non-linear trajectories in which there is a subsequent
  decline from a maximum. The dynamics of the individual scenarios are also different
  across gasses, sectors, or world regions. This particularly diminishes the significance
  of focusing scenario categorization on any given year, such as 2100. In addition,
  all gases that contribute to radiative forcing should be considered, but methods
  of combining gases such as the use of global warming potentials (GWP) are appropriate
  only for near-term GHG inventories<sup><small><a href="fn7.htm#4" onClick="showFootnote(7,4); return false;">4</a></small></sup>.
  In light of these difficulties, the classification approach presented here uses
  cumulative CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions between 1990 and 2100. CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> is the dominant GHG and
  cumulative CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions are expected to be roughly proportional to CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> radiative
  forcing over the time scale of a century. According to the IPCC SAR, "any eventual
  stabilised concentration is governed more by the accumulated anthropogenic CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>
  emissions from now until the time of stabilisation than by the way emissions
  change over the period" (Houghton <i>et al</i>., 1996). Therefore, the writing
  team also grouped the scenarios according to their cumulative emissions (see
  <a href="#fig68">Figure 6.8</a>).</p>

	  one marker scenario plus alternatives that lead to comparable cumulative

<p>This categorization can guide comparisons using either scenarios with different
  driving forces yet similar emissions, or scenarios with similar driving forces
  but different emissions. This characteristic of SRES scenarios also has very
  important implications for the assessment of climate-change impacts, mitigation,
  and adaptation strategies. Two future worlds with fundamentally different characteristic
  features, such as the A1 and B2 marker scenarios, also have different cumulative
  CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions, but very similar CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions in 2100. In contrast, scenarios
  that are in the same category of cumulative emissions can have fundamentally
  different driving forces and different CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions in 2100, but very similar
  cumulative emissions. Presumably, adverse impacts and effective adaptation measures
  would vary among the scenarios from different families that share similar cumulative
  emissions, but have different demographic, socio-economic, and technological
  driving forces. This is another reason for considering the entire range of emissions
  in future assessments of climate change.</p>
<p><a href="#fig69">Figure 6-9</a> shows the histogram of cumulative CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>
  emissions from 1990 to 2100 for the SRES scenarios subdivided into the four
  emissions categories. Relative positions of the four marker scenarios, and the
  ranges of the four families and the six IS92 scenarios, are marked. The SRES
  scenarios have a bimodal structure similar to the distribution of cumulative
  emissions from the scenarios in the literature. The groups of SRES scenarios
  span the whole range of cumulative emissions from the scenarios in the literature.
  The range of the four markers is from 1000 to 1900 GtC. In comparison, the IS92
  cumulative emissions range from 700 GtC for IS92c to 2140 GtC for IS92e.</p>
<p>The SRES emissions scenarios encompass emissions of other GHGs and chemically
  active species such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane volatile
  organic compounds. The emissions of other gases follow dynamic patterns much
  like those shown in Figures <a href="137.htm#fig65">6-5</a> and <a href="137.htm#fig66">6-6</a>
  for CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions. Further details of GHG emissions are given in <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a>.<br>
