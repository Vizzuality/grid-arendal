<h3><a name="anc1"></a>1.7.2. Narrative Storylines and Scenario Quantifications
</h3>
<p>Given these large ranges of future emissions and their driving forces, there
  are an infinite number of possible alternative futures to explore. The SRES
  scenarios cover a finite, albeit a very wide, range of future emissions. To
  facilitate the process of identifying alternative future developments, the writing
  team decided to describe their scenarios coherently by narrative storylines.
  The storylines describe developments in many different economic, technical,
  environmental and social dimensions. The main reasons for formulating storylines
  are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>help the writing team to think more coherently about the complex interplay
    between scenario driving forces within each and across alternative scenarios;</li>
  <li>make it easier to explain the scenarios to the various user communities
    by providing a narrative description of alternative futures that goes beyond
    quantitative scenario features;</li>
  <li>make the scenarios more useful, in particular to analysts who contribute
    to IPCC WGII and WGIII; the social, political and technological context described
    in the scenario storylines is all-important in analyzing the effects of policies
    either to adapt to climate change or to reduce GHG emissions; and</li>
  <li>provide a guide for additional assumptions to be made in detailed climate
    impact and mitigation analyses, because at present no single model or scenario
    can possibly respond to the wide variety of informational and data needs of
    the different user communities of long-term emissions scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>The writing team consciously applied the principle of Occam's Razor (i.e.,
  the economy of thought, Eatwell <i>et al</i>., 1998). They sought the minimum
  number of scenarios that could still serve as an adequate basis to assess climate
  change and that would still challenge policy makers to test possible response
  strategies against a significant range of plausible futures. The team decided
  on four storylines, as an even number helps to avoid the impression that there
  is a "central" or "most likely" case. The writing team wanted more than two
  storylines to help to illustrate that the future depends on many different underlying
  dynamics; the team did not want more than four, as it wanted to avoid complicating
  the process by too many alternatives. The scenarios would cover a wide range
  of - but not all possible - futures. In particular, there would be no "disaster"
  scenarios. None of the scenarios include new explicit climate policies. The
  team decided to carry out sensitivity tests within some of the storylines by
  considering alternative scenarios with different fossil-fuel reserves, rates
  of economic growth, or rates of technical change.</p>
<p>The storylines describe developments in many different social, economic, technological,
  environmental and policy dimensions. The titles of the storylines have been
  kept simple: A1, A2, B1 and B2. There is no particular order among the storylines;
  they are listed in the alphabetic and numeric order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very rapid
    economic growth, low population growth, and the rapid introduction of new
    and more efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are convergence among
    regions, capacity building and increased cultural and social interactions,
    with a substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita income.
    The A1 scenario family develops into four groups that describe alternative
    directions of technological change in the energy system <sup><small><a href="fn2.htm#8" onClick="showFootnote(2,8); return false;">8</a></small></sup></li>
  <li>The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world.
    The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local identities.
    Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which results in high
    population growth. Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and
    per capita economic growth and technological change are more fragmented and
    slower than in other storylines.</li>
  <li>The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with the
    same low population growth as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid changes
    in economic structures toward a service and information economy, with reductions
    in material intensity, and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient
    technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social, and
    environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without additional
    climate initiatives.</li>
  <li>The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis
    is on local solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability.
    It is a world with moderate population growth, intermediate levels of economic
    development, and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in
    the B1 and A1 storylines. While the scenario is also oriented toward environmental
    protection and social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels.</li>

<p><a href="#fig14">Figure 1-4</a> schematically illustrates the SRES scenarios.
  It shows that the scenarios build on the main driving forces of GHG emissions.
  Each scenario family is based on a common specification of the main driving
  forces. The four scenario families are illustrated, very simplistically, as
  branches of a two-dimensional tree. The two dimensions indicate global and regional
  scenario orientation and development and environmental orientation, respectively.
  In reality, the four scenarios share a space of a much higher dimensionality
  given the numerous driving forces and other assumptions needed to define any
  given scenario in a particular modeling approach..</p>
<p>After determining the basic features and driving forces for each of the four
  storylines, the teams began to model and quantify them. This resulted in 40
  scenarios, each constituting an alternative interpretation and quantification
  of a storyline. All the interpretations and quantifications associated with
  a single storyline are called a scenario "family" (see also <a href="031.htm#box12">Box
  1-2</a> on terminology and <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a> for further details).</p>
<p>In all, six models were used to generate the 40 scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Asian Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) from the National Institute of Environmental
    Studies in Japan (Morita <i>et al</i>., 1994);</li>
  <li>Atmospheric Stabilization Framework Model (ASF) from ICF Consulting in the
    USA (Lashof and Tirpak, 1990; Pepper <i>et al</i>., 1992, 1998; Sankovski
    <i>et al</i>., 2000);</li>
  <li>Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect (IMAGE) from the National
    Institute for Public Health and Environmental Hygiene (RIVM) (Alcamo <i>et
    al</i>., 1998; de Vries <i>et al</i>., 1994, 1999, 2000), used in connection
    with the Dutch Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB) WorldScan model (de
    Jong and Zalm, 1991), the Netherlands;</li>
  <li>Multiregional Approach for Resource and Industry Allocation (MARIA) from
    the Science University of Tokyo in Japan (Mori and Takahashi, 1999; Mori,
    2000);</li>
  <li>Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and their General Environmental
    Impact (MESSAGE) from the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis
    (IIASA) in Austria (Messner and Strubegger, 1995; Riahi and Roehrl, 2000);
    and the</li>
  <li>Mini Climate Assessment Model (MiniCAM) from the Pacific Northwest National
    Laboratory (PNNL) in the USA (Edmonds <i>et al</i>., 1994, 1996a, 1996b).</li>
</ul>
<p>These six models are representative of emissions scenario modeling approaches
  and different IA frameworks in the literature and include so-called top-down
  and bottom-up models.</p>
<p>The six models have different regional aggregations. The writing team decided
  to group the various global regions into four "macro-regions" common to all
  different regional aggregations across the six models. The four macro-regions
  (see <a href="149.htm">Appendix III</a>) are broadly consistent with the
  allocation of the countries in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
  Change (UNFCCC, 1997), although the correspondence is not exact because of changes
  in the countries listed in Annex I of the UNFCCC:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The OECD90 region groups together all countries that belong to the OECD
    as of 1990, the base year of the participating models, and corresponds to
    Annex II countries under UNFCCC (1992).</li>
  <li>The REF region comprises those countries undergoing economic reform and
    groups together the East European countries and the Newly Independent States
    of the former Soviet Union. It includes Annex I countries outside Annex II
    as defined in UNFCCC (1992).</li>
  <li>The ASIA region stands for all developing (non-Annex I) countries in Asia.</li>
  <li>The ALM region stands for rest of the world and includes all developing
    (non-Annex I) countries in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the OECD90 and REF regions together correspond to the developed
  (i.e., industrialized) countries while the ASIA and ALM regions together correspond
  to the developing countries. The OECD90 and REF regions are consistent with
  the Annex I countries in the Framework Convention on Climate Change, while the
  ASIA and ALM regions correspond to the non-Annex I countries.</p>
