	<p><b>Box SPM-1: The Main Characteristics of the Four SRES Storylines
	  and Scenario Families.</b></p>
	<p align="center"><a name="spm1"></a><img src="images/spm1.gif" width="600" height="399" border="0"></p>
	<p align="left"><b>Figure SPM-1: </b>Schematic illustration
	  of SRES scenarios. Four qualitative storylines yield four sets of scenarios
	  called "families": A1, A2, B1, and B2. Altogether 40 SRES scenarios
	  have been developed by six modeling teams. All are equally valid with
	  no assigned probabilities of occurrence. The set of scenarios consists
	  of six scenario groups drawn from the four families: one group each
	  in A2, B1, B2, and three groups within the A1 family, characterizing
	  alternative developments of energy technologies: A1FI (fossil fuel intensive),
	  A1B (balanced), and A1T (predominantly non-fossil fuel). Within each
	  family and group of scenarios, some share "harmonized" assumptions on
	  global population, gross world product, and final energy. These are
	  marked as "HS" for harmonized scenarios. "OS" denotes scenarios that
	  explore uncertainties in driving forces beyond those of the harmonized
	  scenarios. The number of scenarios developed within each category is
	  shown. For each of the six scenario groups an illustrative scenario
	  (which is always harmonized) is provided. Four illustrative marker scenarios,
	  one for each scenario family, were used in draft form in the 1998 SRES
	  open process and are included in revised form in this report. Two additional
	  illustrative scenarios for the groups A1FI and A1T are also provided
	  and complete a set of six that illustrate all scenario groups. All are
	  equally sound.</p>
	<p align="left">By 2100 the world will have changed in ways that are difficult
	  to imagine - as difficult as it would have been at the end of the 19th
	  century to imagine the changes of the 100 years since. Each storyline
	  assumes a distinctly different direction for future developments, such
	  that the four storylines differ in increasingly irreversible ways. Together
	  they describe divergent futures that encompass a significant portion
	  of the underlying uncertainties in the main driving forces. They cover
	  a wide range of key "future" characteristics such as demographic change,
	  economic development, and technological change. For this reason, their
	  plausibility or feasibility should not be considered solely on the basis
	  of an extrapolation of current economic, technological, and social trends.</p>
      </div>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <div align="left">The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future
	    world of very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks
	    in mid-century and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction
	    of new and more efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are
	    convergence among regions, capacity building, and increased cultural
	    and social interactions, with a substantial reduction in regional
	    differences in per capita income. The A1 scenario family develops
	    into three groups that describe alternative directions of technological
	    change in the energy system. The three A1 groups are distinguished
	    by their technological emphasis: fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil
	    energy sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources (A1B)<sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#3" onClick="showFootnote(1,3); return false;">3</a></small></sup>
	    .</div>
	</li>
	<li>The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous
	  world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local
	  identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly,
	  which results in continuously increasing global population. Economic
	  development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic
	  growth and technological change are more fragmented and slower than
	  in other storylines.</li>
	<li>The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world
	  with the same global population that peaks in mid-century and declines
	  thereafter, as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid changes in economic
	  structures toward a service and information economy, with reductions
	  in material intensity, and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient
	  technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social,
	  and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without
	  additional climate initiatives.</li>
	<li>The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the
	  emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social, and environmental
	  sustainability. It is a world with continuously increasing global population
	  at a rate lower than A2, intermediate levels of economic development,
	  and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in the B1
	  and A1 storylines. While the scenario is also oriented toward environmental
	  protection and social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels.</li>

<p><i>Within each scenario family two main types of scenarios were developed -
  those with harmonized assumptions about global population, economic growth,
  and final energy use and those with alternative quantification of the storyline.</i>
  Together, 26 scenarios were harmonized by adopting common assumptions on global
  population and gross domestic product (GDP) development. Thus, the harmonized
  scenarios in each family are not independent of each other. The remaining 14
  scenarios adopted alternative interpretations of the four scenario storylines
  to explore additional scenario uncertainties beyond differences in methodologic
  approaches. They are also related to each other within each family, even though
  they do not share common assumptions about some of the driving forces.</p>
<p><i>There are six scenario groups that should be considered equally sound that
  span a wide range of uncertainty, as required by the Terms of Reference</i>.
  These encompass four combinations of demographic change, social and economic
  development, and broad technological developments, corresponding to the four
  families (A1, A2, B1, B2), each with an illustrative "marker" scenario. Two
  of the scenario groups of the A1 family (A1FI, A1T) explicitly explore alternative
  energy technology developments, holding the other driving forces constant, each
  with an illustrative scenario. Rapid growth leads to high capital turnover rates,
  which means that early small differences among scenarios can lead to a large
  divergence by 2100. Therefore the A1 family, which has the highest rates of
  technological change and economic development, was selected to show this effect.</p>
<p><i>In accordance with a decision of the IPCC Bureau in 1998 to release draft
  scenarios to climate modelers for their input in the Third Assessment Report,
  and subsequently to solicit comments during the open process, one marker scenario
  was chosen from each of four of the scenario groups based on the storylines.
  </i>The choice of the markers was based on which of the initial quantifications
  best reflected the storyline, and features of specific models. Marker scenarios
  are no more or less likely than any other scenarios, but are considered by the
  SRES writing team as illustrative of a particular storyline. These scenarios
  have received the closest scrutiny of the entire writing team and via the SRES
  open process. Scenarios have also been selected to illustrate the other two
  scenario groups. Hence, this report has an illustrative scenario for each of
  the six scenario groups.</p>
