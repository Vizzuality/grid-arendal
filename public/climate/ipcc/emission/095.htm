<h3>4.3.4. B2 Storyline and Scenario Family</h3>
<p>The B2 world is one of increased concern for environmental and social sustainability
  compared to the A2 storyline. Increasingly, government policies and business
  strategies at the national and local levels are influenced by environmentally
  aware citizens, with a trend toward local self-reliance and stronger communities.
  International institutions decline in importance, with a shift toward local
  and regional decision-making structures and institutions. Human welfare, equality,
  and environmental protection all have high priority, and they are addressed
  through community-based social solutions in addition to technical solutions,
  although implementation rates vary across regions.</p>
<p>Like the other scenario families, the B2 scenario family includes futures that
  can be seen as positive or negative. While the B2 storyline is basically neutral,
  Kinsman (1990) in his "Caring Autonomy" scenario clearly paints a positive world
  with emphasis on decentralized governments and strong interpersonal relationships.
  In the "New Civics" scenario by Wilkerson (1995), values are only shared within
  small competing groups, which results in a decentralized world of tribes, clans,
  families, networks, and gangs. The IIASA-WEC "Middle Course" scenario (Nakic´enovic´
  et al., 1998), with slow removal of trade barriers, may also be grouped in this
  family. On the positive side, this storyline appears to be consistent with current
  institutional frameworks in the world and with the current technology dynamics.
  On the negative side is the relatively slow rate of development in general,
  but particularly in the currently developing parts of the world.</p>
<p>Education and welfare programs are pursued widely, which reduces mortality
  and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about 10 billion
  people by 2100, consistent with both the UN and IIASA median projections. Income
  per capita grows at an intermediate rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By
  2100 the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion. International
  income differences decrease, although not as rapidly as in storylines of higher
  global convergence. Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development
  of stronger community-support networks.</p>
<p>Generally, high educational levels promote both development and environmental
  protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few truly international
  common priorities that remain in B2. However, strategies to address global environmental
  challenges are not of a central priority and are thus less successful compared
  to local and regional environmental response strategies. The governments have
  difficulty designing and implementing agreements that combine global environmental
  protection, even when this could be associated with mutual economic benefits.</p>
<p>The B2 storyline presents a particularly favorable climate for community initiative
  and social innovation, especially in view of the high educational levels. Technological
  frontiers are pushed less than they are in A1 and B1, and innovations are also
  regionally more heterogeneous. Globally, investment in energy R&D continues
  its current declining trend (EIA, 1997, 1999), and mechanisms for international
  diffusion of technology and know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and
  B1 (but higher than in A2). Some regions with rapid economic development and
  limited natural resources place particular emphasis on technology development
  and bilateral cooperation. Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy
  intensity of GDP declines at about 1% per year, in line with the average historical
  experience since 1800.</p>
<p>Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level in the B2
  world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a particular focus of community
  innovation, and contributes to a low level of car dependence and less urban
  sprawl. An emphasis on food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary
  patterns toward local products, with relatively low meat consumption in countries
  with high population densities.</p>
<p>Energy systems differ from region to region, depending on the availability
  of natural resources. The need to use energy and other resources more efficiently
  spurs the development of less carbon-intensive technology in some regions. Environment
  policy cooperation at the regional level leads to success in the management
  of some transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification caused by
  sulfur dioxide (SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> ), especially to sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural
  production. Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of nitrogen
  oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which reduce the incidence
  of elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy system remains
  predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, a gradual transition occurs away from
  the current share of fossil resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding
  reduction in carbon intensity.</p>
