<h3>3.2.5. Relationships<a name="anc1"></a></h3>
<h4>3.2.5.1. Introduction<a name="anc2"></a></h4>
<p>Within the caveats in <a href="050.htm#anc1">Section 3.1</a>, a number of demographic
  studies show that population change does exert a strong first-order scaling
  effect on CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions models (O'Neill, 1996; Gaffin and O'Neill, 1997; O'Neill
  <i>et al</i>., 2000; Wexler, 1996). These studies support the notion that population
  growth and the policies that affect it are key factors for future emissions.
  Balanced against this, however, are other studies that take a more skeptical
  view (Kolsrud and Torrey, 1992; Birdsall, 1994; Preston, 1996). A full review
  of model results that address this question is given in O'Neill (1996) and Gaffin
  and O'Neill (1997) and is not be reproduced here because of space limitations
  (for a review see Gaffin, 1998). In essence, the controversy is one of the relationships
  between population growth and economic development, as well as other salient
  factors that influence emissions. These relationships were first discussed within
  the context of IPCC emissions scenarios by Alcamo et al. (1995) and are discussed
  in more detail in the following sections.</p>

<p><a href="#fig37">Figure 3-7</a> shows the long-established negative correlation
  between fertility rates and per capita income. Clearly, richer countries uniformly
  have a relatively low fertility rate. Poorer countries, on average, have a higher
  fertility rate. Lower fertility, however, does exist in some poor countries
  or regions, which illustrates the importance of social and institutional structures.</p>
<p>Barro (1997) reports a statistically significant correlation between per capita
  GDP growth and the variables life expectancy and fertility in his analysis of
  post-1960 growth performance of 100 countries. Other things being equal, growth
  rates correlate positively (higher) with increasing life expectancy and negatively
  (lower) with high fertility, which confirms the view that the affluent live
  longer and have fewer children.</p>
<p><a href="#fig37">Figure 3-7</a>, a snapshot of many countries passing through
  the "demographic fertility transition" can be explained from both economic and
  socio-demographic points of view (Easterlin, 1978). Economically, <a href="#fig37">Figure
  3-7</a> can be interpreted as a reflection of the substitution that families
  make - away from having children and toward consuming more goods and services.
  With greater wealth, both goods and services become increasingly available as
  part of the families' "basket of choices" for consumption and, accordingly,
  they shift away from higher fertility to lower fertility. This move is further
  prompted by the rising relative costs of childcare, which include preferences
  that increase a child's quality of life, such as better schooling and extracurricular
  activities.</p>
<p>This income effect is primarily interpreted with respect to fertility changes
  in currently developing countries. In currently industrial countries, any change
  of fertility in response to increasing wealth is likely to be different from
  and probably even opposite to that of developing countries' fertility. Indeed,
  there is evidence of this in Eastern Europe, Sweden, Russia, and (recently)
  the United States (UN, 1997a), and it is linked to the question of long-term
  fertility rates in industrial countries (<a href="052.htm#anc1">see Section
  3.2.3.2.</a>). However, it is evident that future world population levels will
  be dominated by growth in developing countries. Thus, if it is accepted that
  fertility is lower with greater affluence, then in emissions scenarios lower
  populations will still tend to correlate with higher per capita incomes.</p>
<p>Another countervailing factor is that mortality rates should also decline with
  wealth; as an isolated effect, this obviously results in higher population levels.
  However, the combined impact of both fertility and mortality reduction on population
  size is a net reduction in population levels (Lutz, 1996).</p>
<p>From a demographic point of view, the primary effect seen in <a href="#fig37">Figure
  3-7</a> is interpreted as infant and child mortality decline with increasing
  affluence. Families, in a sense, have to use birth control to achieve their
  desired number, which has always been lower than fertility rates. Increased
  affluence results in increased knowledge of, access to, and use of birth control,
  and accordingly families shift their reproductive behavior to lower fertility
  rates. Accompanying this basic premise is a host of complex social changes,
  including increased opportunities for education, employment, and non-maternal
  roles for women. Incorporation of the inverse relationship between economic
  and population growth in long-term emission scenarios is recent and mostly carried
  out in a qualitative way. Alcamo et al. (1995) reviews the literature available
  up to 1994. Nakicenovic <i>et al</i>. (1998a) report a long-term scenario
  study in which timing and extent of economic catch-up in developing countries
  were found to be tied to timing and pace of their demographic transition. Patterns
  of the range of per capita GDP growth rates for developing countries available
  in the literature (and given in <a href="059.htm#fig310">Figure 3-10</a>) also
  appear to reflect this relationship. Growth trends for the period 2020-2050
  are generally higher than those for earlier or later periods; it is in this
  period that, according to demographic projections, the fastest change in demographic
  variables (especially fertility) will take place.</p>
