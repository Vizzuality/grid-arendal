<h1> <a name="anc5"></a>What is the range of GHG emissions in the SRES scenarios and how do they
  relate to driving forces?</h1>
<p><i>The SRES scenarios cover most of the range of carbon dioxide (CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> ; <a href="#spm2">see
  Figures SPM-2a and SPM-2b</a>), other GHGs, and sulfur emissions found in the
  recent literature and SRES scenario database.</i> Their spread is similar to
  that of the IS92 scenarios for CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from energy and industry as well
  as total emissions but represents a much wider range for land-use change. The
  six scenario groups cover wide and overlapping emission ranges. The range of
  GHG emissions in the scenarios widens over time to capture the long-term uncertainties
  reflected in the literature for many of the driving forces, and after 2050 widens
  significantly as a result of different socio-economic developments.  <a href="008.htm#tblspm2b">Table SPM-2b</a> summarizes the emissions across the scenarios in 2020, 2050,
  and 2100. <a href="005.htm#spm3">Figure SPM-3</a> shows in greater detail the ranges of total CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions
  for the six scenario groups of scenarios that constitute the four families (the
  three scenario families A2, B1, and B2, plus three groups within the A1 family
  A1FI, A1T, and A1B).</p>

<p><i>Some SRES scenarios show trend reversals, turning points (i.e., initial
  emission increases followed by decreases), and crossovers (i.e., initially emissions
  are higher in one scenario, but later emissions are higher in another scenario).</i>
  Emission trend reversals (see Figures <a href="#spm2">SPM-2</a> and <a href="#spm3">SPM-3</a>)
  depart from historical emission increases. In most of these cases, the upward
  emissions trend due to income growth is more than compensated by productivity
  improvements combined with a slowly growing or declining population.</p>

<p><i>In many SRES scenarios CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from loss of forest cover peak after
  several decades and then gradually decline <sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#7" onClick="showFootnote(1,7); return false;">7</a></small></sup>
  (<a href="003.htm#spm1">Figure SPM-1b</a>).</i> This pattern is consistent with
  scenarios in the literature and can be associated with slowing population growth,
  followed by a decline in some scenarios, increasing agricultural productivity,
  and increasing scarcity of forest land. These factors allow for a reversal of
  the current trend of loss of forest cover in many cases. Emissions decline fastest
  in the B1 family. Only in the A2 family do net anthropogenic CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from
  land use change <sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(1,2); return false;">2</a></small></sup>
  remain positive through 2100. As was the case for energy-related emissions,
  CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions related to land-use change in the A1 family cover the widest range.
  The diversity across these scenarios is amplified through the high economic
  growth, increasing the range of alternatives, and through the different modeling
  approaches and their treatment of technology.</p>

<p><i>Total cumulative SRES carbon emissions from all sources through 2100 range
  from approximately 770 GtC to approximately 2540 GtC</i>. According to the IPCC
  Second Assessment Report (SAR), "any eventual stabilised concentration is governed
  more by the accumulated anthropogenic CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from now until the time
  of stabilisation than by the way emissions change over the period." Therefore,
  the scenarios are also grouped in the report according to their cumulative emissions.<sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#8" onClick="showFootnote(1,8); return false;">8</a></small></sup>
  (see <a href="005.htm#spm4">Figure SPM-4</a>). The SRES scenarios extend the IS92 range toward higher emissions
  (SRES maximum of 2538 GtC compared to 2140 GtC for IS92), but not toward lower
  emissions. The lower bound for both scenario sets is approximately 770 GtC.</p>
<p><i>Total anthropogenic methane (CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>) and nitrous oxide (N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O) emissions span
  a wide range by the end of the 21st century (see Figures <a href="#spm5">SPM-5</a>
  and <a href="#spm6">SPM-6</a> derived from Figures <a href="120.htm#fig55">5.5</a>
  and <a href="122.htm#fig57">5.7</a>).</i> Emissions of these gases in a number
  of scenarios begin to decline by 2050. The range of emissions is wider than
  in the IS92 scenarios due to the multimodel approach, which leads to a better
  treatment of uncertainties and to a wide range of driving forces. These totals
  include emissions from land use, energy systems, industry, and waste management.</p>
<p><i>Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from land use are limited in A1 and
  B1 families by slower population growth followed by a decline, and increased
  agricultural productivity.</i> After the initial increases, emissions related
  to land use peak and decline. In the B2 family, emissions continue to grow,
  albeit very slowly. In the A2 family, both high population growth and less rapid
  increases in agricultural productivity result in a continuous rapid growth in
  those emissions related to land use.</p>
<p><i>The range of emissions of HFCs in the SRES scenario is generally lower than
  in earlier IPCC scenarios.</i> Because of new insights about the availability
  of alternatives to HFCs as replacements for substances controlled by the Montreal
  Protocol, initially HFC emissions are generally lower than in previous IPCC
  scenarios. In the A2 and B2 scenario families HFC emissions increase rapidly
  in the second half of the this century, while in the A2 and B2 scenario families
  the growth of emissions is significantly slowed down or reversed in that period.</p>
<p>Sulfur emissions in the SRES scenarios are generally below the IS92 range,
  because of structural changes in the energy system as well as concerns about
  local and regional air pollution. These reflect sulfur control legislation in
  Europe, North America, Japan, and (more recently) other parts of Asia and other
  developing regions. The timing and impact of these changes and controls vary
  across scenarios and regions <sup><small><a href="fn1.htm#9" onClick="showFootnote(1,9); return false;">9</a></small></sup>.</p>
<p>After initial increases over the next two to three decades, global sulfur emissions
  in the SRES scenarios decrease (see <a href="008.htm#tblspm1b">Table SPM-1b</a>),
  consistent with the findings of the 1995 IPCC scenario evaluation and recent
  peer-reviewed literature.</p>
<p><i>Similar future GHG emissions can result from very different socio-economic
  developments, and similar developments of driving forces can result in different
  future emissions.</i> Uncertainties in the future developments of key emission
  driving forces create large uncertainties in future emissions, even within the
  same socio-economic development paths. Therefore, emissions from each scenario
  family overlap substantially with emissions from other scenario families. The
  overlap implies that a given level of future emissions can arise from very different
  combinations of driving forces. Figures <a href="003.htm#spm1">SPM-1</a>, <a href="#spm2">SPM-2</a>,
  and <a href="#spm3">SPM-3</a> show this for CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> .</p>
<p><i>Convergence of regional per capita incomes can lead to either high or low
  GHG emissions</i>. Tables <a href="008.htm#tblspm1a">SPM-1a</a> and <a href="008.htm#tblspm1b">SPM-1b</a>
  indicate that there are scenarios with high per capita incomes in all regions
  that lead to high CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions (e.g., in the high-growth, fossil fuel intensive
  scenario group A1FI). They also indicate that there are scenarios with high
  per capita incomes that lead to low emissions (e.g., the A1T scenario group
  or the B1 scenario family). This suggests that in some cases other driving forces
  may have a greater influence on GHG emissions than income growth.</p>
