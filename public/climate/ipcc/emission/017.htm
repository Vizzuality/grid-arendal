<p>This comparison of SRES scenario characteristics implies that similar future
  emissions can result from very different socio-economic developments, and similar
  developments of driving forces can result in different future emissions. Uncertainties
  in the future development of key emission driving forces create large uncertainties
  in future emissions even within the same socio-economic development paths. Therefore,
  emissions from each scenario family overlap substantially with emissions from
  other scenario families.</p>
<p>To facilitate comparisons of emissions and their driving forces across the
  scenarios, the writing team grouped them into four categories of cumulative
  emissions between 1990 and 2100. However, any categorization of scenarios based
  on emissions of multiple gases is quite difficult. <a href="#figts8">Figure
  TS-8</a> shows total CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from all sources (from <a href="016.htm#figts7">Figures
  TS-7a and b</a>). The 40 scenarios are shown aggregated into six groups, three
  for the A1 family (that result by merging the two fossil-intensive groups A1C
  and A1G into one A1FI group as in the SPM). The scenarios that remain outside
  the six groups adopted alternative interpretations of the four scenario storylines.
  The emission trajectories ("bands") of the scenario groups display different
  dynamics, from monotonic increases to non-linear trajectories in which there
  is a subsequent decline from a maximum. The dynamics of the individual scenarios
  are also different across gasses, sectors, or world regions. This particularly
  diminishes the significance of focusing scenario categorization on any given
  year, such as 2100. In addition, all gases that contribute to radiative forcing
  should be considered, but methods of combining gases such as the use of global
  warming potentials (GWPs) are appropriate only for near-term GHG inventories
  <sup><small><a href="fn11.htm#6" onClick="showFootnote(11,6); return false;">6</a></small></sup>
  . In light of these difficulties, the classification approach presented here
  uses cumulative CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions between 1990 and 2100. CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> is the dominant GHG
  and cumulative CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions are expected to be roughly proportional to CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>
  radiative forcing over the time scale of a century. According to the IPCC SAR,
  "any eventual stabilized concentration is governed more by the accumulated anthropogenic
  CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from now until the time of stabilization than by the way emissions
  change over the period" (Houghton <i>et al</i>., 1996). Therefore, the writing
  team also grouped the scenarios according to their cumulative emissions.</p>

<p>Cumulative SRES carbon emissions through to 2100 range from less than 800 GtC
  to more than 2500 GtC with a median of about 1500 GtC. To represent this range,
  the scenario classification uses four intervals as follows: less than 1100 GtC
  (low), between 1100 and 1450 GtC (medium-low), between 1450 and 1800 GtC (medium-high),
  and greater than 1800 GtC (high). Each CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> interval contains multiple scenarios
  and scenarios from more than one family. Each category also includes one of
  the four marker scenarios. <a href="#figts9">Figure TS-9 </a>shows how cumulative
  carbon emissions from the 40 SRES scenarios fit within the selected emission
  intervals (see <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a> for further details). The 40
  SRES scenarios extend the IS92 range toward higher emissions (SRES maximum of
  2570 GtC compared to 2140 GtC for IS92), but not toward lower emissions. The
  lower bound for both scenario sets is just below 800 GtC.<br>
</p>
<p>This categorization can guide comparisons using either scenarios with different
  driving forces yet similar emissions, or scenarios with similar driving forces
  but different emissions. This characteristic of SRES scenarios also has very
  important implications for the assessment of climate-change impacts, mitigation,
  and adaptation strategies. Two future worlds with fundamentally different characteristic
  features, such as the A1B and B2 marker scenarios, also have different cumulative
  CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions and radiative forcing, but very similar CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions in 2100.
  In contrast, scenarios that are in the same category of cumulative emissions
  can have fundamentally different driving forces and different CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions
  in 2100, but very similar cumulative emissions and radiative forcing. Presumably,
  adverse impacts and effective adaptation measures would vary among the scenarios
  from different families that share similar cumulative emissions but have different
  demographic, socio-economic, and technological driving forces. This is another
  reason for considering the entire range of emissions in future assessments of
  climate change.</p>
<h1><a name="anc2"></a>9.2. Other Greenhouse Gases</h1>
<p>Of the GHGs, CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> is the main contributor to anthropogenic radiative forcing
  because of changes in concentrations from pre-industrial times. According to
  Houghton et al. (1996) well-mixed GHGs (CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> ,CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> ,N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, and the halocarbons)
  induced additional radiative forcing of around 2.5 W/m <sup>2</sup> on a global
  and annually averaged basis. CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> accounted for 60% of the total, which indicates
  that the other GHGs are significant as well. Whereas CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions are by-and-large
  attributable to two major sources, energy consumption and land-use change, other
  emissions arise from many different sources and a large number of sectors and
  applications (e.g. see <a href="116.htm#tbl53">Table 5-3</a> in <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a>).</p>
<p>The SRES emissions scenarios also have different emissions for other GHGs and
  chemically active species such as CO, NO<sub>x</sub> (nitrogen oxides), and NMVOCs. The
  uncertainties that surround the emissions sources of the other GHGs, and the
  more complex set of driving forces behind them are considerable and unresolved.
  Therefore, the models and approaches employed for the SRES analyses cannot produce
  unambiguous and generally approved estimates for different sources and world
  regions over a century. Keeping these caveats above in mind, <a href="021.htm#tblts4a">Table
  TS-4</a> (see later) shows the emissions of all relevant direct and indirect
  GHGs for the four marker scenarios and, in brackets, the range of the other
  scenarios in the same family (or scenario groups for the A1 family). <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a> gives further detail about the full range of GHG emissions across the
  SRES scenarios. The emissions of other gases follow dynamic patterns much like
  those shown in Figures <a href="016.htm#figts7">TS-7</a> and <a href="#figts8">TS-8
  </a>for carbon dioxide emissions. A summary of GHG emissions is given in <a href="131.htm">Chapter
  6</a> and further details in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
