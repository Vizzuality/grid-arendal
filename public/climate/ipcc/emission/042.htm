<p>An overview of global long-term scenarios of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions is shown in <a href="#fig23">Figure
  2-3</a>. Altogether 81 scenarios in the scenario database report SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions.
  Most scenarios were published after 1995, which indicates the importance of
  the influential and innovative SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions included in the previous IPCC scenario
  series IS92 (Pepper <i>et al</i>., 1992). Apparently, they stimulated research
  on long-term trends and impacts of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions.</p>
<p>The 1990 base-year emissions estimates in the database range from 55 to 91
  megatons of sulfur (MtS), a seemingly large difference that can be explained
  partially by the different extent of coverage of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in different
  models and scenario studies, in addition to uncertainties in emissions factors.
  Typically, lower range emissions derive from models that report only (the dominant)
  energy sector emissions, higher ranges also include other anthropogenic sources
  such as SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions from metallurgic processes. Differences in 1990 base-year
  values across scenario studies and a review of available SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions inventories
  are discussed in more detail in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>. Indexed to
  a common 1990 basis, future SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions trends reveal a number of remarkable
  characteristics. First, contrary to other trends discussed in this chapter,
  increases are generally modest; numerous scenarios even depict a long-term decline
  in emissions. Thus, SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions are invariably projected to be decoupled progressively
  from their underlying driving forces of increases in population and economic
  activity, and hence energy demand. The median across all scenarios indicates
  a gradual increase of some 22% over 1990 levels by 2050, and a return to 1990
  levels by 2100. Only two scenarios exceed the range of increases in long-term
  SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions spanned by the IS92 scenario series.</p>
<p>A detailed review of long-term global and regional SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions scenarios
  is given in Gr�bler (1998) and is summarized in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>.
  The most important new finding from the scenario literature is recognition of
  the significant impacts of continued unabated high SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions on human health,
  food production, and ecosystems. As a result, scenarios published since 1995
  all assume various degrees of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions control and interventions to be
  implemented in the future, and are thus substantially lower than previous projections,
  including the IS92 series. In most of these scenarios, such low levels of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small>
  emissions are not simply the result of direct SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions control measures,
  such as flue gas desulfurization. They also result from other interventions
  in which SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions reduction is more a secondary benefit than a primary
  goal (e.g., structural changes for various reasons other than SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> control).</p>
<h3><a name="anc2"></a>2.4.4. Population Projection Ranges</h3>
<p>Population is one of the fundamental driving forces of future emissions. Most
  models used to formulate population projections for the emissions scenarios
  are taken from the literature and are exogenous inputs. Today three main research
  groups project global population - United Nations (UN, 1998, 1999), World Bank
  (Bos and Vu, 1994), and IIASA (Lutz <i>et al</i>., 1997). (For more details
  see the discussion in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>.) Most of the "central"
  population projections lead to a doubling of global population by 2100 (to about
  10 billion people compared to 5.3 billion in 1990). In recent years the central
  population projections for the year 2100 have declined somewhat, but are still
  in line with a doubling by 2100. For example, the latest UN (1998) medium-low
  and medium-high projections indicate a range of between 7.2 and 14.6 billion
  people by 2100, with the medium scenario at 10.4 billion. The IIASA central
  estimate for 2100 is also 10.4 billion, with a 95% probability that world population
  would exceed six and be lower than 17 billion (Lutz <i>et al</i>., 1997).</p>

<p>While all scenarios require some kind of population assumptions, relatively
  few are reported explicitly in the SRES database. <a href="042.htm#fig24">Figure
  2-4</a> illustrates global population projections in the database. Of the 416
  scenarios currently documented, only 46 report their underlying population projections.
  This limited number indicates that, even though population is an extremely important
  driving force for emissions, it is typically either not reported or not well
  explored in most models. For the small sample of population projections, the
  range is from about 20 to 6 billion people in 2100, with the central or median
  estimates at about 10 billion. Thus, population assumptions in the emissions
  scenarios appear to be broadly consistent with the recent population projections,
  with the caveat that only a few underlying projections are reported in the database.</p>
<p> <a href="042.htm#fig24">Figure 2-4</a> contrasts the alternative population
  projections from the SRES database with historical developments. The long-term
  historical population growth rate has been on average about 1% per year during
  the past two centuries. Between 1800 and 1900 the global population growth rate
  was about 0.5% per year. The average annual growth rate since 1900 has been
  1.3%. Between 1990 and 1995 the rate was 1.46%; and since 1995 world population
  has been growing at a rate of 1.3% annually (UN, 1998). All scenarios reviewed
  here envisage that population growth will slow in the future. The most recent
  doubling of the world's population took approximately 40 years. Even the highest
  population projections in <a href="042.htm#fig24">Figure 2-4</a> require 70
  years or more for the next doubling, while in roughly half of the scenarios
  the global population does not double during the 21st century. The highest average
  population growth across all projections is 1.2% per year, the lowest is 0.1%
  per year, and the median is about 0.7% per year.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the population projections in <a href="042.htm#fig24">Figure
  2-4</a> are not evenly distributed across the full range. Instead, they are
  grouped into three clusters. The middle cluster is representative of the central
  projections, with a range of about 10 to less than 12 billion people by 2100.
  The other two clusters mark the highest and the lowest population projections
  available in the literature, with between 15 and 20 billion at the high end
  and about 6 billion at the low end.</p>
<p>Despite these large ranges among alternative global population projections,
  the variation in this factor compared to the base year is the smallest of all
  the scenario driving forces considered in this comparison. Compared with 1990
  values, the factor increase varies from 3.3 to 1.2.</p>
