<h3>5.5.2. Sulfur</h3>
<p>Aerosols result from complex atmospheric processes in which sulfur emissions
  play an important role. Besides sulfur, other substances, like NO<sub>x</sub>, ammonia,
  and small particles from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass, are involved
  in these processes.</p>

<p><b><a name="fig512"></a></b>Global anthropogenic sulfur emissions are estimated to range between 65 and
  90 MtS in 1990 (Houghton et al., 1995; Benkovitz et al., 1996; Olivier et al.,
  1996; WMO, 1997). Reviews of most recent inventories, given in Smith et al.
  (2000) and Gr�bler (1998), indicate a most likely value of 75 � 10 MtS. These
  reviews draw on a large body of literature sources and sulfur inventories (in
  particular the EMEP and CORINAIR inventories for Europe, NAPAP for North America,
  and the most recent inventories available for Asia, including Akimoto and Narita
  (1994), Foell et al. (1995), and Kato (1996)). Anthropogenic emissions add to
  natural sulfur flows, which are estimated to range between 4 and 45 MtS (Houghton
  et al., 1995). Pepper et al. (1992) adopted an intermediary, constant natural
  sulfur flux of 22 MtS for the IS92 scenario series.</p>
<p>Even with a comparatively good agreement on global sulfur emission levels,
  important uncertainties remain at the sector and regional levels (discussed
  in more detail in Alcamo et al. (1997) and Gr�bler (1998)). The main sources
  of uncertainties are a lack of detailed inventory data (especially for developing
  countries outside Asia, but also for the non-European part of Russia), uncertainties
  in sulfur contents of fuels (especially coal) in many regions, and the use of
  different base years for development of sulfur inventories. For instance, inventories
  and scenario studies for China and Centrally Planned Asia give a range of sulfur
  emissions that differ by more than a factor of two (8.4 to 18 MtS) for the year
  1990 (Gr�bler, 1998).</p>
<p>Base-year differences in the available data sources are especially important
  because regional sulfur emissions trends have changed drastically in the past
  decade. Although they decreased strongly in Europe and North America as a result
  of sulfur control policies, they increased rapidly in Asia with growing energy
  demand and coal use. For instance, between 1980 and 1995 sulfur emissions declined
  by 59% in Western Europe and Russia (albeit for entirely different reasons -
  environmental policy limiting sulfur emissions in Western Europe versus a massive
  economic depression in Russia), by 37% in Eastern Europe, and by 36% in North
  America (ECE, 1997). Conversely, emissions in China rose rapidly, from an estimated
  6.6 MtS in 1985 to 9.1 MtS in 1994, or by 38% (Sinton, 1996; Dadi et al., 1998).
  These diverging emission trends and their rapid changes also require a continuous
  updating of available gridded sulfur emission inventories (e.g., Dignon and
  Hameed, 1989; Spiro et al., 1992; Benkovitz et al., 1996; Olivier et al., 1996)
  that in, some instances, still rely on outdated 1980 emissions data.</p>
<p>Global base-year (1990) sulfur emission values from the SRES models range from
  63 to 77 MtS, with the addition of 3 MtS from international shipping<a href="fn6.htm#9" onClick="showFootnote(6,9); return false;"><sup>9</sup></a>.
  This difference reflects the existing uncertainty in sulfur emission estimates,
  particularly at the regional level. The range is within the range of values
  given by global inventories.</p>

</table>
<p><b><a name="fig513a"></a></b>Model differences at the regional level are even larger, which reflects the
  greater uncertainty of emission inventories at this level, particularly outside
  the OECD countries. To standardize sulfur emissions, the number of SRES reporting
  regions was increased to six regions, by splitting Latin America from the ALM
  region and Centrally Planned Asia and China from ASIA. Important differences
  in economic development status and resource endowments lead to different patterns
  of sulfur emissions across all SRES scenarios. Regional emissions were standardized
  (see <a href="115.htm#box51">Box 5-1</a>) and then aggregated to the global
  level. Global standardized base-year emissions for 1990 for the SRES scenarios
  are equal to 70.9 MtS, in line with the literature range of global emission
  inventories given above. The regional sulfur emission profiles were also used
  to generate spatially gridded emission patterns (see <a href="129.htm#562">Section
  5.6.2</a> below).</p>
<p>Concerning future emissions of sulfur, the SRES scenarios reflect recent literature
  and trends of sulfur control scenarios, as well as the conclusions from the
  1994 evaluation of the IS92 scenarios (Alcamo et al., 1995). Despite considerable
  scenario variability, all scenarios portray similar emission dynamics - at various
  future dates (between 2020-2030 and 2070, depending on the scenario and its
  underlying storyline), global SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions reach a maximum level and decline
  thereafter (Figure 5-12). By 2030 sulfur emissions range between 40 and 160
  MtS<a href="fn6.htm#10" onClick="showFootnote(6,10); return false;"><sup>10</sup></a>,
  by 2070 between 20 and 165 MtS, and by 2100 between 10 and 95 MtS. Emission
  trajectories of the SRES scenarios reflect a combined impact of different scenario
  driving forces (local air quality concerns, structural change in energy supply
  and end-use, etc.), which lead to a gradual decline in sulfur emissions in the
  second half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>Importantly, all SRES scenarios are sulfur-control scenarios only and do not
  assume any additional climate policy measures. There is, however, an indirect
  effect of GHG emission reduction from sulfur-control policies that result in
  energy conservation and inter-fuel substitution from high sulfur to low sulfur
  fuels (e.g., from coal to gas).</p>
<h4>5.5.2.1. A1 Scenario Family<a name="5521"></a></h4>
<p>The A1 family of scenarios covers most of the range of the 40 SRES scenarios
  (<a href="#fig513a">Figure 5-13a</a>). The A1B-AIM marker is in the middle of the range and its trajectory
  is similar to those of many other scenarios - a rapid increase in the near term
  followed by a decline. Increasing fossil fuel use in developing countries combined
  with low levels of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> controls produces the near-term increase in emissions.
  After 2025, per capita incomes reach levels at which countries place more emphasis
  on the environment, resulting in emission controls on SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (see <a href="110.htm">Section
  4.4.10</a>). These controls, combined with a transition from fossil fuels to
  non-fossil energy, result in declining emissions. More detailed information
  as to how SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions are treated in the A1B-AIM scenario is provided in <a href="#box53">Box
  5-3</a>.</p>
<p>Another A1 family scenario, A1G-MiniCAM, shows similar behavior for the same
  reasons, although the increase and subsequent decline in emissions is less pronounced.
  The MiniCAM model has a higher level of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> controls, but also a greater fossil
  fuel use, resulting in slightly higher SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in 2100.</p>
<p>The A1T, A1G, and A1C scenario groups assume various roles for the development
  of energy resources and technologies (the coal-intensive A1C scenario group,
  the oil- and gas-intensive A1G group, and the A1T scenario group with accelerated
  non-fossil technology diffusion). Consequently, they span a very wide range
  of future sulfur emissions, ranging from 20 MtS by 2100 in the A1T-MESSAGE scenario
  to 83 MtS in the A1C-AIM scenario.<br>

	the A1B-AIM Marker Scenario</b> </p>
      <p align="left">In the A1B-AIM marker scenario, global SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions increase rapidly
	from 70.6 MtS in 1990 to reach a peak around 2020 at 101 MtS, and subsequently
	decline to around 30 MtS after 2050. The global SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emission trajectory
	follows that of the developing countries, for which emissions increase
	because of the rapid growth of fossil fuel use driven by rapid economic
	development, combined with a lack of sulfur controls that reflect investment
	and infrastructure limitations. With an increase in personal incomes in
	developing countries and associated concerns about local air pollution,
	SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> becomes controlled in a similar way to that in developed countries,
	for which SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions have declined in the past two decades. The sources
	of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions tracked by the AIM model include energy use, industrial
	production processes (steel and cement production), and biomass burning.
	The major factors of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emission reduction are changes in the fuel mix,
	use of advanced energy technology, and implementation of desulfurization
	technology. In the A1B-AIM scenario, the volume and share in total primary
