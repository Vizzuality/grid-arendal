<h4>4.4.5.2. Harmonized and Other A1 Scenarios</h4>
<p>The various A1 scenarios indicate a wide range in energy intensity improvements
  and resultant energy demand. A1B-MESSAGE tracks closely the global and regional
  energy demand patterns of the A1B marker and so satisfies the criteria of a
  "fully harmonized" scenario, albeit that ASIA deviations from the A1B marker
  amount to about 20% during the period 2030 to 2060. Other scenarios indicate,
  for example, higher energy demand in 2050 (e.g., A1-ASF) and/or lower energy
  demand in 2100 (e.g., A1B-IMAGE, A1B-ASF, and A1B-MARIA). Differences are regionally
  heterogeneous and result from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Higher GDP growth rates assumptions compared to those of the A1B marker
    (e.g., A1-MiniCAM for OECD90).</li>
  <li>Higher or lower (non-price induced) assumptions in energy intensity improvement
    rates in the various scenarios.</li>
  <li>Differences in technology assumptions that lead to differences in projected
    energy prices</li>
  <li>Combination of all three above factors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The differences in model representation of these factors along with the available
  time and resources have not allowed a detailed analysis of the numerous underlying
  differences in energy intensities across the scenarios. For instance, final
  energy use in the A1v1-MiniCAM and A1v2-MiniCAM scenarios reaches about 60%
  only of the final energy use described in the A1 marker. However, both scenarios
  describe very different worlds with respect to economic growth but share the
  assumption of saturating per capita energy use at levels of 150 GJ/capita. All
  else being equal, scenarios of lower GDP per capita growth (e.g. A1v2-MiniCAM)
  generally also assume lower improvement rates in energy intensity, consistent
  with the literature (as discussed in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Generally,
  the range between energy intensity across scenarios is larger in the 1990 base
  year than toward the end of the simulation horizon. This results from alternative
  estimates and model specifications of non-commercial energy use (excluded in
  some models), which yield large differences in 1990 energy intensities. Over
  time - and consistent with the high-income characteristics of an A1 world -
  the use of non-commercial energy declines and is ultimately phased out altogether.
  Thus, by 2100 differences in energy intensities across models become much smaller.
  An interesting set of scenarios was explored in the A1T group. In these the
  diffusion of a whole host of new energy end-use technologies (e.g., microturbines,
  fuel cells) results in substantial additional gains in efficiency and hence
  higher energy intensity improvements and lower final energy demand at equal
  or lower energy costs compared to the other A1 scenarios.</p>
<h4>4.4.5.3. A2 Scenarios<a name="4453"></a></h4>
<p>Final energy intensities in the A2 (ASF) marker scenario improve steadily,
  with the exception of the ALM-region between 1990 and 2020 because of material
  and energy intensive infrastructure build-up. The fastest reduction occurs in
  the REF region as its energy-intensive economy progressively restructures. The
  slowest improvements are projected for the OECD90 region, because of slow capital
  turnover rates (GDP growth of 1.6% per year between 1990 and 2100). The final
  energy demand across regions is determined by the product of regional GDP growth
  and energy intensity improvements. For example, the higher energy intensities
  in ASIA compared to the ALM region lead to a higher absolute final energy demand
  in the former in spite of a lower GDP. This is explained by differences in initial
  conditions and by delayed diffusion of more efficient energy end-use technologies,
  because of lower GDP per capita growth.</p>
<h4>4.4.5.4. Harmonized and Other A2 Scenarios<a name="4454"></a></h4>
<p>The global primary energy use and final energy use in the A2 scenarios created
  with the AIM, MESSAGE, and MiniCAM models are quite close to those of the marker
  scenario, while A2-IMAGE scenario projects lower primary and final energy use
  compared to the A2 marker. As mentioned above, the A2- A1-MiniCAM scenario explores
  a very different unfolding of driving forces in terms of population and GDP
  growth, combined with an assumption about saturating energy demand at current
  Western European levels. Combined, these assumptions translate into the lowest
  energy intensity improvement rates across the SRES scenario set. Global primary
  energy use per unit of GDP (intensities) improves from 14.7 MJ/US$90 in 1990
  to 8.9 MJ/US$90 in 2100. This reflects mainly the low per capita GDP (productivity)
  growth of this scenario which (other factors being equal) translates into low
  rates of energy intensity improvement. Nonetheless, the resultant energy intensities
  are comparable to current Western European levels, as are income and energy
  use per capita. In other words, the scenario describes a global picture by 2100
  quite similar to that of Western Europe of today, 100 years earlier.</p>
<h4>4.4.5.5. B1 Scenarios<a name="4455"></a></h4>
<p>Energy intensity improvements in the B1 marker result from energy efficiency
  investments brought about by increases in fuel and electricity prices and technological
  innovations (including assumptions on taxes and perceived premium values for
  clean fuels). The rather high rates in energy intensity reduction in B1 stem
  also from the explicit assumption that less industrialized regions catch-up.
  Another factor is the assumption that monetary economic growth in less developed
  regions initially largely replaces activities in the informal economy, which
  leads to a replacement of traditional non-commercial energy forms by high-efficiency
  modern applications and fuels - and hence substantial energy intensity improvements.
  In the developed regions the high economic growth in the B1 scenario may, for
  instance, be in the form of increasing monetization of human activities previously
  not included in GDP accounts (e.g., childcare, household work). Such monetary
  GDP growth does not result in additional demands for energy services, and hence
  again results in significant energy intensity improvements. The demand for electricity
  is assumed to rise faster than that for non-electricity energy, and may pose
  one of the capital availability constraints in this scenario. </p>
<h4>4.4.5.6. Harmonized and Other B1 Scenarios<a name="4456"></a></h4>
<p>Various alternative scenario quantifications were developed for B1 by the modeling
  teams. For the first four to five decades most model runs show a global final
  energy use within the proposed bounds of the B1 marker, except B1-ASF which
  is higher. By 2100 most scenarios assume higher final energy use than the marker
  run, except B1-MESSAGE which reproduces closely the final energy use of the
  B1 marker (and is correspondingly classified as a "fully harmonized" scenario).
  In particular, B1-MARIA, B1High-MiniCAM, and B1High-MESSAGE show a global final
  energy use in 2100 nearly twice that of the marker. These scenarios explored
  the implications for energy demand of less rapid "dematerialization" tendencies
  of the economy, especially for developing countries, with trends in line with
  historical energy intensity experiences in the OECD countries. Regional trends
  differ most dramatically for the MiniCAM and MARIA runs for ASIA and ALM, with
  the MiniCAM simulations assuming a saturating (converging) energy use on a per
  capita basis at 125 GJ/capita. However, current knowledge about rates and direction
  of demateriali-zation of economic activities is limited. Therefore, both historical
  OECD trends and their applicability to the future economies of currently developing
  countries may not necessarily reflect future developments. The use of alternative
  modeling approaches in the quantification of the B1 scenario storyline has helped
  to shed light on this important area of uncertainty of the future.</p>
<h4>4.4.5.7. B2 Scenarios<a name="4457"></a></h4>
<p>Final energy demand for the B2 marker was derived by applying efficiencies
  of end-use technologies to the demand of electric and non-electric energy services.
  These in turn depend on the economic development rates, income levels, and sectoral
  economic structure of each region. The evolution of the final energy demand
  levels and structure in the developing regions follows patterns that are similar
  to the historical development in the now-industrialized regions of the world.
  This again is consistent with the "dynamics-as-usual" interpretation of the
  B2 storyline. By successive iterations with a macro-economic model, marginal
  cost increases are taken into account in the energy demand projections of the
  MESSAGE model for the B2 marker (see <a href="150.htm">Appendix IV</a>).
  The result is an aggregate energy-intensity improvement rate at the global level
  of about 1% per year until 2100, about the same as has prevailed over the past
  100 years in countries for which such long-term time series data are available
  (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>). This aggregate global improvement rate
  masks important differences in the temporal and spatial evolution of energy
  intensities. Improvements are generally higher in regions far away from the
  energy-intensity frontier and also faster in those for which the capital turnover
  rate (i.e., GDP growth) is higher. Consistent with the more imperfect realization
  of future trends characteristic of the B2 scenario, energy intensity improvements
  are slower than in the A1 or B1 scenario families, but higher than in the A2
  scenario family.</p>
<h4>4.4.5.8. Harmonized and Other B2 Scenarios<a name="4458"></a></h4>
<p>The energy intensity and resultant global growth in final energy demand of
  the B2 marker is matched reasonably well by other scenario quantifications until
  about 2050; the B2-AIM scenario shares "fully harmonized" input assumptions
  at the global and regional levels alike over the entire time horizon. By 2100,
  however, differences become larger, and in particular the two MiniCAM scenarios
  show lower final energy intensity improvements compared to the B2 marker and
  other B2 scenarios. The MiniCAM scenarios were developed to explore high-end
  sensitivities for GHG emissions in the B2 scenario family by assuming higher
  energy demand, combined with a high reliance on coal in the B2High-MiniCAM scenario.
  Different scenarios at the regional level illustrate alternative interpretations,
  with particularly large variations in the REF and ALM regions. Alternative scenarios
  indicate up to 50% lower energy use in REF (e.g., B2-IMAGE) and up to 50% higher
  energy use in ALM (B2-MiniCAM, B2High-MiniCAM) compared to the B2 marker. The
  alternative scenarios illustrate that uncertainties in future energy intensities
  and resultant final energy demand are generally larger for developing and transition
  economies compared to the OECD90 region. Among other reasons, this is a function
  of the much higher uncertainties with respect to future economic growth rates
  in these regions.</p>
<p>An interesting observation (considering the SRES multi-model approach) is that
  the changes in structure of final energy are similar in the four markers of
  the SRES scenario families, even though these are derived from four different
  modeling approaches and describe very different futures in terms of demographic,
  socio-economic, and energy development (<a href="103.htm#fig47">Figure 4-7</a>)<a href="fn5.htm#28" onClick="showFootnote(5,28); return false;"><sup>28</sup></a>.
  The trend is toward energy reaching the consumer in more flexible, more convenient,
  and cleaner forms. This reflects that people with higher income are willing
  to pay more for more convenient energy forms (e.g., even if coal were cheaper
  than gas, everybody would rather heat with gas than coal). Therefore, the final
  energy mix is characterized by growing importance and dominance of grid-dependent
  fuels, such as electricity, district heat, and gas. Consistent with the storylines
  and the higher income levels of A1 and B1, this change in final energy structure
  is faster in these scenario families than in the other two scenario families.
  The structural shift is slowest in scenario A2, with scenario B2 taking an intermediate
  position. These scenario differences mainly reflect differences in per capita
  income levels.</p>
