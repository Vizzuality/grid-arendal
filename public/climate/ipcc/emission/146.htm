<h1>Appendix I: SRES Terms of Reference New IPCC Emissions Scenarios</h1>
<p>It is proposed that Working Group III coordinate the development of new emissions
  scenarios that assume no additional climate policy initiatives.</p>
<h1>I.1. Background</h1>
<p>In 1992 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released six emissions
  scenarios (Leggett <i>et al</i>., 1992) providing alternative emissions trajectories
  spanning the years 1990 through 2100 for greenhouse-related gases, Carbon dioxide
  (CO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), nitrogen oxyde
  (NO<sub>x</sub>), and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). These scenarios were intended for use by atmospheric
  and climate scientists in the preparation of scenarios of atmospheric composition
  and climate change. The work updated and extended earlier work prepared for
  the IPCC first assessment report. These six scenarios are referred to as the
  IS92 scenarios.</p>
<p>In many ways the IS92 scenarios were pathbreaking. They were the first global
  scenarios to provide estimates of the full suite of greenhouse gases. At the
  time, they were the only scenarios to provide emission trajectories for SO<sub>2</sub>. 
  Alcamo <i>et al</i>. (1995) reviewed the scenarios and found that the fossil
  fuel carbon emissions trajectories spanned more than half of the open literature
  emissions scenarios reviewed. Other emissions trajectories had received less
  scrutiny in the open literature and, while the IS92 cases were not dissimilar
  to those in the open literature, the open literature was extremely sparse in
  many instances.</p>
<p>Much has changed in the period following the creation of the IS92 scenarios.
  Sulfur emissions have been recognized as a more important radiative forcing
  factor than other non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse-related gases, and some regional control
  policies have been adopted. Restructuring in the states of Eastern Europe and
  the Former Soviet Union has had far more powerful effects on economic activity
  and emissions than were foreseen in the IS92 scenarios. For some regions these
  scenarios are not representative of those found in the literature. The advent
  of integrated assessment (IA) models has made it possible to construct self-consistent
  emissions scenarios that jointly consider the interactions between energy, economy,
  and land-use changes.</p>
<p>Alcamo <i>et al</i>. (1995) found that for the purposes of driving atmospheric
  climate models, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions trajectories of the IS92 scenarios provided
  a reasonable reflection of variations found in the open literature. However,
  scenarios are also required for other purposes, and the IS92 scenarios are not
  suitable for purposes for which they were not developed. It was concluded that,
  if the scenarios were intended to have broader uses than simply a set of emissions
  trajectories to drive climate models, new scenarios should be developed. Further,
  a new approach should be adopted. The new approach should open the process to
  the broader research community.</p>
<h2>I.2. Approach<a name="I.2"></a></h2>
<p>It is proposed that new scenarios should be developed through a coordinated
  effort that draws upon the expertise of all researchers in the relevant community.
  A three-step process is envisaged. First, key input assumptions would be reviewed
  and provided to modelers. Second, modelers would be asked to construct emissions
  scenarios based on the input assumptions provided. Finally, the model results
  will be used to develop new emissions scenarios in the form of average results
  for participating models or results from a representative model.</p>
<p>A writing team would be established to consider key input assumptions (such
  as population projections and technologic change) and emissions from specific
  sources (such as SO<sub>2</sub> emissions and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to land-use change), possibly
  with the assistance of specialized task groups. The writing team will also stipulate
  a set of geographical reporting regions, reporting years, units of measure,
  etc., designed to provide climate modelers, impact assessment analysts, and
  other users with the detail they need for their work. Finally, the writing team
  would ensure that the range of results reflects the underlying uncertainty and,
  to the extent possible, that the assumptions for specific scenarios are internally
  consistent.</p>
<p>Scenario development will be an open process. There will be no "official" model.
  There will be no "expert teams." Any research group with the capability of preparing
  scenarios for any region can participate. This means that, while modeling teams
  which employ global coverage will be able to participate, so too will regional
  modelers. By opening the process in this way, developing and developed region
  researchers with local expertise can participate even if they do not have global
  coverage. Modeling teams will be provided with information on the input assumptions
  and other necessary information such as, for example, the world oil price, to
  regional modeling teams.</p>
<p>Once the modeling teams have completed their work, a set of scenarios will
  be chosen. This will likely be the inputs and outputs of a "representative"
  model, but it could also be the average of the participating models or some
  other representation of the model results.</p>
<h2>I.3. Reporting and Distribution of Results<a name="I.3"></a></h2>
<p>To maximize the usefulness of the new scenarios, two steps should be taken.
  First, arrangements should be made with an organization whose mission it is
  to disseminate information to provide a means by which users can access scenario
  results. All results from research institutions will be included in the database
  along with associated assumptions. In addition, for research teams willing to
  participate, the associated models will also be made available so that users
  can not only have access to scenario assumptions and outputs, but have the capability
  of independently creating derivative scenarios.</p>
<h2>I.4. Timing and Coordination<a name="I.4"></a></h2>
<p>It is proposed that the writing team begin work before the end of 1996. The
  team should establish the parameters - geographic reporting regions, reporting
  years, time horizon, units, etc. - by the end of the first quarter of 1997.
  Reports of the expert groups on the range of values for each of the input assumptions
  should be available by the end of the third quarter of 1997. The scenario results
  corresponding to these input assumptions should be available from participating
  modeling groups during the first quarter of 1998. Peer and government review
  should be complete by the end of 1998.</p>
