<h1>4.4. Scenario Quantification and Overview</h1>
<h3> 4.4.1. Scenario Terminology<a name="1"></a></h3>
<p>In this section representative quantifications of the four scenario storylines
  described in <a href="093.htm">Section 4.3</a> are summarized, and the evolution of the main scenario
  driving forces and associated quantitative scenario characteristics are described.
  Their resultant GHG and other emissions are discussed in more detail in <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a>.</p>
<p>To elucidate differences in uncertainties that stem both from adopting alternative
  (exogenous) scenario driving-force assumptions and from the uncertainties that
  arise from different model representations, alternative scenario quantifications
  are differentiated into harmonized and unharmonized scenarios (see <a href="091.htm">Section
  4.2</a>, <a href="092.htm#table4.1">Tables 4-1</a> and <a href="091.htm#tbl42">4-2</a>,
  and <a href="025.htm#box11">Box 1-1</a> for terminology description).</p>
<p>To achieve harmonization across six different modeling approaches is not a
  trivial task. For example, most of the models have different regional disaggregations,
  so that harmonization at the level of the four SRES regions required some "inverse"
  solutions, often achieved through iterative model runs and adjustments of input
  assumptions. Also, in some modeling frameworks the harmonized "input" parameters
  are actually outputs of components of the modeling framework (e.g., GDP as an
  output of economic general equilibrium models, or final energy as an output
  variable after considering endogenous energy prices and exogenously pre-specified
  energy-intensity improvement rates). Therefore, harmonization of important scenario
  driving-force inputs was neither possible for all scenarios and for all participating
  modeling teams, and nor was it judged desirable, as the adoption of any harmonization
  criterion somewhat artificially compresses uncertainty. This is also why simpler
  harmonization criteria were adopted (see <a href="091.htm">Section 4.2</a>.
  above) that focused on global population and GDP growth profiles. These are
  referred to as "globally harmonized" scenarios in the subsequent Subsections.</p>
<p>From the 40 SRES scenarios, 26 are classified as "globally harmonized" scenarios
  and 14 are classified as "other" scenarios. (The latter category includes three
  scenarios that only deviate slightly from the harmonization criteria.) Harmonized
  scenarios are thus comparable in that they describe similar global development
  patterns with respect to demographics and economic growth. In the subsequent
  discussion of scenario driving forces a three-tiered structure is adopted. First,
  for each scenario family (and where applicable for each scenario group in the
  A1 scenario family), the discussion starts with a presentation of the respective
  marker and "fully harmonized" scenarios. Subsequently, "globally harmonized"
  scenarios and "other" scenarios are discussed. "Globally harmonized" scenarios
  shed additional light into uncertainties that stem from adopting different regional
  assumptions (see above). Finally, "other" scenarios are presented that offer
  a different quantitative interpretation of a particular scenario storyline compared
  to the previous scenario categories. In some cases, differences in interpretation
  relate to uncertainties in rates of change - "other" scenarios yield similar
  global demographic and economic outcomes by 2100 (e.g. the B2-ASF scenario compared
  to the B2 marker), but illustrate different dynamics of how these could unfold.
  In other cases, the "other" scenario category comprises scenario quantifications
  that deliberately explore alternative interpretations of a scenario storyline
  in terms of global population and GDP growth altogether (e.g. in the A2-A1-
  MiniCAM scenario). The reason is to indicate that quantitative scenario descriptions
  entail a high degree of uncertainty (and subjectivity from different modeling
  teams) when it comes to interpret the four different qualitative SRES scenario
  storylines and to translate them into the quantitative assumptions that drive
  emission models. When comparing GHG emissions results for the four SRES marker
  scenarios (see <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>) with those of the other SRES
  scenarios, it is illustrative to distinguish the effects of different model
  methodologies and parametrizations from variations of important scenario drivers
  that often serve as exogenous input to models.</p>
<p>Of the total of 40 SRES scenarios, 29 (including the marker scenarios) satisfy
  the harmonization criteria for population on the world level and for all four
  SRES regions, 12 scenarios are harmonized for population and GDP, and 11 (13
  including the A1T scenario group) scenarios are harmonized for population, GDP
  and final energy (see <a href="092.htm#table4.1">Table 4-1</a>). Also, 35 scenarios
  are harmonized for population on the world level and 26 scenarios are harmonized
  for global population and GDP (see <a href="092.htm#table4.1">Table 4-1</a>).
  The status of harmonization is also relatively stable to changes in the harmonization
  criteria. For example, if the above harmonization criteria were increased by
  50% (i.e. GDP for the four SRES regions may differ by up to ±38% from the respective
  GDP of the marker scenario), the sample of 11 harmonized scenarios does not
  change; however, the number of scenarios harmonized on the global level increases
  from 15 to 20.</p>
<p>Thus, as mentioned above not all scenario quantifications comply with the adopted
  harmonization criteria differences in regional coverage and definition among
  models. In some instances modeling teams also deliberately chose not to follow
  harmonized input assumptions, but instead explored scenario sensitivities by
  emphasizing alternative developments than suggested in the marker scenario quantification.
  The writing team recognizes that this increases the number of scenarios as well
  as complexity in the interpretation of results. These additional scenarios are
  the result of the SRES terms of reference of proceeding via an open process
  soliciting as wide participation and viewpoints as possible and also serve the
  purpose of highlighting important uncertainties of the future that are necessarily
  compressed by limiting scenario quantification to four illustrative marker scenarios.
  Thus, while unharmonized scenarios illustrate the impact on GHG emissions of
  expanding the uncertainty range of main scenario drivers within any particular
  scenario family, the "globally harmonized" scenarios indicate the range of GHG
  emissions uncertainty that remains after most important global driving force
  assumptions (population and GDP) have been harmonized. (Finally, the range of
  GHG emissions resulting from comparing "fully harmonized" scenarios is indicative
  of the uncertainty of internal model parametrizations such as energy technology
  change, dietary patterns, and agricultural productivity changes that influence
  structural changes in energy supply and end-use and land-use changes, see <a href="092.htm#table4.1">Table
  4-1</a>.)</p>
<p>Harmonization of input assumptions increases the comparability across scenarios
  and can serve as an additional guide for choosing a particular SRES scenario
  subset, and to illustrate different degrees of scenario uncertainty. The latter
  is an important aspect, considering the different user communities of SRES scenarios.
  Given the comparatively narrow variation as defined by the harmonization criteria,
  differences in population, GDP, and final energy use between harmonized scenarios
  of the same scenario family need not to be considered in subsequent analyses
  and are also not discussed separately below.</p>
<p>In the A1 scenario family, the scenarios within one group were also harmonized.
  In one A1 scenario group the transition away from conventional oil and gas either
  leads to a massive development of unconventional oil and gas resources (A1G)
  or to a large-scale synfuel economy based on coal (A1C). Please note that A1C
  and A1G were combined into one fossil intensive group A1FI in the Summary for
  Policymakers during its approval process (see also footnote 1). GHG emissions
  in these scenarios approach emissions characteristic of the A2 scenario family
  (i.e. are much higher than in the case of the A1 marker scenario). In another
  A1 scenario group, dwindling conventional oil and gas resources lead to fast
  development of post-fossil alternatives and enhanced energy conservation. In
  this technology-intensive scenario group (A1T), energy demands are lower than
  in the other A1 scenario groups and, because of radical technological change
  in energy systems, GHG emissions are much lower than in the other A1 scenario
  groups (including the A1B marker scenario), approaching those of the B1 scenario
  family.</p>
<p>The six modeling teams also produced other scenarios as part of the SRES open
  process. These modeling runs were generally not harmonized and are presented
  as appropriate later in the report.</p>
