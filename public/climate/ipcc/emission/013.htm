  should assure participation of modeling groups around the world and especially
  from developing countries in any future scenario development and assessment
  efforts. Clearly, this would also require resources specifically directed at
  assisting modeling groups from developing countries. Indeed, a concerted effort
  was made to engage modeling groups and experts from developing countries in
  SRES as a direct response to the recommendations of the last IPCC scenario evaluation
  (Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1995). </p>

  the different regional aggregations across the six models. <a href="013.htm#boxts3">Box

  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992), although the correspondence
  is not exact because of changes in the countries listed in Annex I of UNFCCC

      <p>The six models have different regional aggregations. The writing team
	decided to group the various global regions into four "macro-regions"
	common to all the different regional aggregations across the six models.
	The four macro-regions (see <a href="149.htm">Appendix III</a>) are
	broadly consistent with the allocation of the countries in the United
	Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992), although
	the correspondence is not exact due to changes in the countries listed
	in Annex I of UNFCCC (1997):</p>
      <ul>
	<li>The OECD90 region groups together all countries belonging to the Organization
	  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as of 1990, the base
	  year of the participating models, and corresponds to Annex II countries
	  under UNFCCC (1992).</li>
	<li>The REF region stands for countries undergoing economic reform and
	  groups together the East European countries and the Newly Independent
	  States of the former Soviet Union. It includes Annex I countries outside
	  Annex II as defined in UNFCCC (1992).</li>
	<li>The ASIA region stands for all developing (non-Annex I) countries
	  in Asia.</li>
	<li>The ALM region stands for rest of the world and includes all developing
	  (non-Annex I) countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In other words, the OECD90 and REF regions together correspond to the
	developed (industrialised) countries (referred to as IND in this report)
	while the ASIA and ALM regions together correspond to the developing countries
	(referred to as DEV in this report). The OECD90 and REF regions are consistent
	with the Annex I countries under the Framework Convention on Climate Change,
	while the ASIA and ALM regions correspond to the non-Annex I countries
	(UNFCCC, 1992).</p>

<p>All the qualitative and quantitative features of scenarios belonging to the
  same family were set to conform to the corresponding features of the underlying
  storyline. Together, 26 scenarios were "harmonized" to share agreed common assumptions
  about global population and GDP (gross domestic product) development (a few
  that also share common population, GDP, and final energy trajectories at the
  level of the four SRES macro-regions are called "fully harmonized," see <a href="090.htm">Section
  4.1.</a> in <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Thus, the harmonized scenarios are not independent within
  each of the four families. However, scenarios within each family vary quite
  substantially in such characteristics as the assumptions about availability
  of fossil-fuel resources, the rate of energy-efficiency improvements, the extent
  of renewable-energy development, and, hence, resultant GHG emissions. Thus,
  after the modeling teams had quantified the key driving forces and made an effort
  to harmonize them with the storylines by adjusting control parameters, there
  still remained diversity in the assumptions about the driving forces and in
  the resultant emissions (see <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a>).</p>
<p>The remaining 14 scenarios adopted alternative interpretations of the four
  scenario storylines to explore additional scenario uncertainties beyond differences
  in methodologic approaches, such as different rates of economic growth and variations
  in population projections. These variations reflect the "modeling teams' choice"
  of alternative but plausible global and regional development compared to "harmonized"
  scenarios and also stem from the differences in the underlying modeling approaches.
  Each of the 40 quantifications of one of the storylines constitutes a SRES scenario.
  This approach generated a large variation and richness in different scenario
  quantifications, often with overlapping ranges of main driving forces and GHG
  emissions across the four families.</p>
<p>In addition, the A1 scenario family branched out into four distinct scenario
  groups. They are based on four alternative technological developments in future
  energy systems, from carbon-intensive development to decarbonization. Similar
  storyline variations were considered for other scenario families, but they did
  not result in genuine scenario groupings within the respective families. This
  further increased richness in different GHG and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions paths, because
  this variation in the structure of the future energy systems in itself resulted
  in a range of emissions almost as large as that generated through the variation
  of other main driving forces such as population and economic development. It
  should be noted that future energy systems variations could be applied to the
  other storylines, but they may evolve differently from those in A1. They have
  been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its "high growth with high
  technology" nature, where differences in alternative technology developments
  translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels. Altogether the
  40 SRES scenarios fall into seven groups: the three scenario families, A2, B1,
  and B2, plus four groups within the A1 scenario. In the SPM, two of these groups,
  the coal and gas and oil intensive groups, were merged into one fossil-intensive
  group, leading to six groups.</p>
<p>As in the case of the storylines, no single scenario - whether it represents
  a modeler's choice or harmonized assumptions - was treated as being more or
  less "probable" than the others belonging to the same family. Initially, for
  each storyline, one modeling group was given principal responsibility, and the
  quantification produced by that group is referred to as the "marker" scenario
  for that storyline. The four preliminary marker scenarios were used in 1998
  to solicit comments during the "open process" and as input for climate modelers
  in accordance with a decision of the IPCC Bureau in 1998. The four marker scenarios
  were posted on the SRES web site (<a target="_top" href="http://sres.ciesin.org/">http://sres.ciesin.org/</a>)
  in June 1998 and were subsequently revised to account for comments and suggestions
  received through this open scenario review process that lasted until January
  1999. In addition to many revisions, the marker scenarios were also harmonized
  along with the other 26 scenarios that adopted common assumptions for the main
  driving forces within the four respective families. The choice of the markers
  was based on extensive discussion of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>range of emissions across all of marker scenarios;</li>
  <li>which of the initial quantifications (by the modelers) reflected the storyline
    best;</li>
  <li>preference of some of the modeling teams and features of specific models;</li>
  <li>use of four different models for the four markers.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result the markers were not intended to be the median or mean scenarios
  from their respective families. Indeed, in general it proved impossible to develop
  scenarios in which all relevant characteristics match mean or median values.
  Thus, marker scenarios are no more or less likely than any other scenarios,
  but are those scenarios considered by the SRES writing team as illustrative
  of a particular storyline. These scenarios have received the closest scrutiny
  of the entire writing team and via the SRES open process compared to other scenario
  quantifications. The marker scenarios are also those SRES scenarios that have
  been most intensively tested in terms of reproducibility. As a rule, different
  modeling teams have attempted to replicate the model quantification of marker
  scenarios. Available time and resources have not allowed a similar exercise
  to be conducted for all SRES scenarios, although some effort was devoted to
  reproduce the four scenario groups (merged into three in the SPM) that constitute
  different interpretations of the A1 storyline with different models.</p>
<p>Additional scenarios using the same harmonized assumptions as the marker scenarios
  developed by different modeling teams and other scenarios that give alternative
  quantitative interpretations of the four storylines constitute the final set
  of 40 SRES scenarios. This also means that the 40 scenarios are not independent
  of each other as they are all based on four storylines and subdivided into seven
  scenario groups (after merging two groups, six in the SPM) that share many common
  assumptions. In addition to many revisions of the marker and other harmonized
  scenarios, other alternative scenarios were formulated by the six modeling teams
  within each of the four scenario families. The result is a more complete, refined
  set of 40 emissions scenarios that reflects the broad spectrum of modeling approaches
  and regional perspectives. However, differences in modeling approaches have
  meant that not all of the scenarios provide estimates for all the direct and
  indirect GHG emissions for all the sources and sectors. In addition to the marker
  scenarios, two scenarios were also selected in the SPM to illustrate the alternative
  energy systems developments in the A1 family. Hence, this report has an illustrative
  scenario for each of the six scenario groups in the SPM. The four SRES marker
  scenarios and the two illustrative scenarios (selected in the SPM) cover all
  the relevant gas species and emission categories comprehensively and thus constitute
  the smallest set of independent and fully documented SRES scenarios.</p>
<p>The scenario groups and cumulative emissions categories were developed as the
  smallest subsets of SRES scenarios that capture the range of uncertainties associated
  with driving forces and emissions. Together, the four markers and the two additional
  illustrative scenarios selected in the SPM from the A1 scenario groups constitute
  the set of SRES scenarios that reflects the uncertainty ranges in the emissions
  and their driving forces. Furthermore, the writing team recommends that, to
  the extent possible, these scenarios, but at least the four markers and the
  two additional illustrative scenarios selected in the SPM, should always be
  used together, and that, in general, no individual scenario should be singled
  out for any purpose. Multiple baselines and overlapping emissions ranges have
  important implications for making policy analysis, e.g., similar policies might
  have different impacts in different scenarios. Combination of policies might
  shape the future development in the direction of certain scenarios.</p>
