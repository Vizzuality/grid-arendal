  The six models have different regional aggregations. The writing team decided
  to group the various global regions into four "macro-regions" common to all
  different regional aggregations across the six models. The four macro-regions
  (see <a href="149.htm">Appendix III</a>) are broadly consistent with the
  allocation of countries in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
  Change (UNFCCC, 1997) although the correspondence is not exact because of changes
  in the countries listed in Annex I of UNFCCC.</p>
<p>All the qualitative and quantitative features of scenarios that belong to the
  same family were set to conform to the corresponding features of the underlying
  storyline. Together, 26 scenarios were "harmonized" to share agreed common assumptions
  about population and gross domestic product (GDP) developments (a few that also
  share common final energy trajectories are called "fully harmonized," see <a href="090.htm">Section
  4.1.</a> in <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Thus, the harmonized scenarios are not independent of
  each other within each family, but they are independent across the four families.
  However, scenarios within each family vary quite substantially in characteristics
  such as the assumptions about availability of fossil-fuel resources, the rate
  of energy-efficiency improvements, the extent of renewable-energy development,
  and, hence, the resultant GHG emissions. Thus, after the modeling teams had
  quantified the key driving forces and made an effort to harmonize them with
  the storylines by adjusting control parameters, there still remained diversity
  in the assumptions about the driving forces and in the resultant emissions (see
  <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a>).</p>

<p>The remaining 14 scenarios adopted alternative interpretations of the four
  scenario storylines to explore additional scenario uncertainties beyond differences
  in methodologic approaches, such as different rates of economic growth and variations
  in population projections. These variations reflect the "modeling teams' choice"
  of alternative but plausible global and regional developments compared to those
  of the "harmonized" scenarios; they also stem from the differences in the underlying
  modeling approaches. This approach generated a large variation and richness
  in different scenario quantifications, often with overlapping ranges of main
  driving forces and GHG emissions across the four families.</p>
<p>In addition, the A1 scenario family branched out into different distinct scenario
  groups, based on alternative technological developments in future energy systems,
  from carbon-intensive development to decarbonization. Similar storyline variations
  were considered for other scenario families, but they did not result in genuine
  scenario groupings within the respective families. However, if future energy
  systems variations were applied fully to other storylines, they may evolve differently
  from those in A1. They have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of
  its "high growth with high technology" nature, for which differences in alternative
  technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission
  levels. The A1 groups further increased the richness in different GHG and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small>
  emissions paths. Indeed, this variation in the structure of future energy systems
  in itself resulted in a range of emissions almost as large as that generated
  through the variation of other main driving forces, such as population and economic
  development. Altogether the 40 SRES scenarios fall into seven groups: the three
  scenario families A2, B1, and B2, plus four groups within the A1 scenario (see
  <a href="fn7.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(7,2); return false;">footnote 2</a>).</p>
<p>As in the case of the storylines, no single scenario - whether it represents
  a modeler's choice or harmonized assumptions - was treated as being more or
  less "probable" than others belonging to the same family. However, one preliminary
  harmonized scenario from each family, referred to as a "marker," was used in
  1998 to solicit comments during the "open process" and as input for climate
  modelers in accordance with a decision of the IPCC Bureau. The four marker scenarios
  were posted on the IPCC web site (<a target="_top" href="http://sres.ciesin.org/">sres.ciesin.org</a>) in June 1998, and the open
  scenario review process through the IPCC web site lasted until January 1999.
  The choice of markers was based on extensive discussion of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Range of emissions across all of marker scenarios.</li>
  <li>Which of the initial quantifications (by the modelers) reflected the storyline.</li>
  <li>Preference of some of the modeling teams and features of specific models.</li>
  <li>Use of different models for the four markers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Markers were not intended to be the median or mean scenarios from their respective
  families. Indeed, in general it proved impossible to develop scenarios in which
  all relevant characteristics matched mean or median values. Thus, marker scenarios
  are no more or less likely than any other scenarios, but are those scenarios
  considered by the SRES writing team as illustrative of a particular storyline.
  These scenarios have received much closer scrutiny, not only from the entire
  writing team, but also via the SRES open process, than other scenario quantifications.
  The marker scenarios are also the SRES scenarios that have been most intensively
  tested in terms of reproducibility. As a rule, different modeling teams have
  attempted to replicate the model quantification of marker scenarios. Available
  time and resources have not allowed a similar exercise to be conducted for all
  SRES scenarios, although some effort was devoted to reproduce the scenario groups
  that constitute different interpretations of the A1 storyline with different
  models.</p>

<p><a name="fig61"></a>Additional scenarios using the same harmonized assumptions as the marker scenarios
  developed by different modeling teams and other scenarios that give alternative
  quantitative interpretations of the four storylines constitute the final set
  of 40 SRES scenarios. However, differences in modeling approaches mean that
  not all the scenarios provide estimates for all the direct and indirect GHG
  emissions for all the sources and sectors. The four SRES marker scenarios cover
  all the relevant gas species and emission categories comprehensively and thus
  constitute the smallest set of independent and fully documented SRES scenarios.</p>
<p>The scenario groups and cumulative emissions categories were developed as the
  smallest subsets of SRES scenarios that capture the range of uncertainties associated
  with driving forces and emissions. Together, the scenario groups constitute
  the set of SRES scenarios that reflects the uncertainty ranges in the emissions
  and their driving forces. Furthermore, the writing team recommends that, to
  the extent possible, these scenarios, but at least the four markers, be used
  to capture the range of uncertainties of driving forces and in addition, the
  two additional illustrative scenarios in A1 be used to capture the range of
  GHG emissions, and these should always be used together, and that no individual
  scenario should be singled out for any purpose. Multiple baselines and overlapping
  emissions ranges have important implications for making policy analysis (e.g.,
  similar policies might have different impacts in different scenarios). Combinations
  of policies might shape the future development in the direction of certain scenarios.
  <a href="142.htm#box64">Box 6-4</a> (see later) summarizes the recommendations
  of the writing team for consideration by the user communities within and outside
  the IPCC.</p>
<p>Thus, there are three different types of scenarios within each family - one
  marker (and two illustrative scenarios in the A1 family), a set of harmonized
  scenarios, and a set of other (non-harmonized) scenarios. In addition, the A1
  family of scenarios is subdivided into groups that describe alternative technological
  developments in the energy system. Together with the other three scenario families
  the SRES scenarios build seven distinct scenario groups (see <a href="fn7.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(7,2); return false;">footnote
  2</a>). <a href="#fig61">Figure 6-1</a> illustrates this scenario terminology
  schematically. The detailed descriptions of inputs and outputs (other than GHG
  emissions) of the SRES marker scenarios, other harmonized scenarios, and all
  other scenarios are presented in <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a> and the Appendices,
  while the emissions of GHGs and other radiatively important species of gases
  are described in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a> and <a href="145.htm">Appendices</a>.</p>
<p>The writing team considers that the SRES scenario set (in all the richness
  of scenario families, groups, markers, and illustrative and harmonized scenarios)
  is based on a "neutral" choice of scenario drivers; no driver is unduly emphasized
  as being more important than others. The scenarios do not suggest that future
  population growth alone is the driver of future emissions, nor do they suggest
  that technological change alone in any one sector could drive future emissions
  in one way or the other. While recognizing the importance of any of these driving
  forces per se, this report illustrates the critical role of relationships and
  interdependencies between scenario driving forces. To an extent it is the nature
  of these relationships that drives the future more than the possible evolution
  of any individual driving forces by itself. In other words, the uncertainty
  of the future is not simply parametric, but deeply functional; uncertainties
  and incomplete understanding exist for both. Qualitative scenario storylines
  add transparency and consistency to the relationships assumed in any particular
  scenario. The storylines also allow for additional interpretation of scenario
  results by different user communities.</p>
