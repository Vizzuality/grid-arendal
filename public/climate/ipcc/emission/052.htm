<h4>3.2.3.2. Currently Available Population Projections<a name="anc1"></a><a name="fig32"></a>
</h4>
<p>World population projections are currently generated by the following institutions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>United States Census Bureau (USCB);</li>
  <li>World Bank;</li>
  <li>UN; and</li>
  <li>IIASA.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main defining characteristics of the individual projections and a detailed
  description of each projection is given in Gaffin (1998).</p>
<p><a href="#fig32">Figure 3-2</a> displays these latest world population numbers
  from all four demographic organizations. Two of the four projections, from the
  World Bank and USCB, contain only one central estimate and are unpublished.
  These are generated currently for internal organizational purposes and are not
  further considered here.</p>
<p>The only population projections that currently incorporate variation of the
  long-range fertility rates are those produced by UN and IIASA (Gaffin, 1998).
  For the UN, these variants result in four additional projections to the UN medium
  projection and are referred to as "low,""medium low," "medium high" and "high."
  The designations reflect the average world fertility rate relative to the medium
  projection. For IIASA, the primary variants also refer to world average fertility
  (and mortality) rate relative to the medium projection and are referred to in
  <a href="#fig32">Figure 3-2</a> as "high" and "low."</p>
<p>The central projections in <a href="#fig33">Figure 3-3</a> show excellent agreement
  over the next 100 years, with the exception of the "overshoot" in the IIASA
  projection, discussed below. Although significant, such an agreement does not
  imply certainty or accuracy. Rather, it reflects the use of similar methodologies
  and databases, the dominance of population momentum associated with a young
  population age structure, and the assumption of replacement-level fertility
  in the long term.<br>
</p>
<p><a href="052.htm#fig34">Figure 3-4</a> shows the breakdown of population growth
  projections in industrial countries (IND) and developing countries (DEV) as
  defined by the UN. The key conclusion to draw from Figure 3-4 is the dominance
  of the DEV population on future world population growth.</p>
<p>The most important variable to determine future population levels is fertility.
  To a lesser extent, future population also depends on mortality and migration
  rates. <a href="052.htm#fig35">Figure 3-5</a> shows the world-average total
  fertility rate (TFR), the average number of births per woman, assumed for the
  various projections. Overall, a fairly broad range of assumptions about future
  world average fertility is encompassed by the projections. Future population
  size is very sensitive (see <a href="#fig32">Figure 3-2</a>) to comparatively
  small changes in the long-range fertility rate. For example, within the UN projections,
  a decrease of the asymptotic fertility rate of less than half-a-birth per woman
  (from 2.1 to 1.7) decreases population in 2100 by 46% (UN, 1998). Only the replacement-level
  fertility of about 2.1 results in a stable population in the long run.</p>
<p>
  Such sensitivity to small asymptotic fertility-rate changes indicates the high
  and low projections from UN and IIASA are all feasible scenarios of the future
  population (Gaffin and O'Neill, 1998).</p>
<p>Up to 2050, the IIASA central TFR is high compared with the UN and World Bank
  central projection. Later the IIASA central TFR declines to below replacement-level
  fertility rate, as depicted in <a href="#fig35">Figure 3-5</a>. As a result,
  the IIASA central forecast lies considerably above all the others throughout
  the 21st century. After that, IIASA's below-replacement, long-term fertility
  assumption causes the projection to decline and to "hit" the World Bank and
  UN curves in 2100. This "overshoot" occurs because the IIASA central scenario
  assumptions rely on an expert poll conducted in 1993 (Lutz, 1994), whereas other
  projections incorporate more recent information into their future assumptions
  (more rapid recent fertility declines in many developing countries; see Courbage,
  1998). However, among demographers disagreement persists on the timing and rates
  of demographic transition in the developing countries, in particular between
  the demographers at IIASA and those at the UN and World Bank (see the discussion
  in Lutz, 1994) on the differences among alternative population projections).
  This disagreement reflects important uncertainties in the projection of future
  demographic developments. The below-replacement, long-term fertility level in
  the IIASA central estimate is a hallmark of the institute's work. Demographers
  at IIASA strongly adhere to the view that there is little reason to expect developed
  nations to return to replacement-level fertility, while much evidence suggests
  that low long-term rates will persist (Lutz <i>et al</i>., 1996). One issue
  here, however, is that the TFR measure is currently depressed in Europe, in
  part because women are delaying their childbearing until later ages (Bongaarts,
  1998). Thus, the TFR may rise if these women do have children, and such a correction
  has to be incorporated into the long-term TFR assumptions (e.g., see Courbage,
  1998). Important uncertainties are by how fast and how much the TFR will rise.</p>
