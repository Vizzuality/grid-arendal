<h3>3.6.4. Sulfur Dioxide<a name="anc1"></a></h3>
<p>Two major sets of driving forces influence future SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Level and structure of energy supply and end-use, and (to a lesser extent)
    levels of industrial output and process mix.</li>
  <li>The degree of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-control policy intervention assumed (i.e., level of environmental
    policies implemented to limit SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions).</li>
</ul>
<p>Gr�bler (1998c) reviewed the literature and empirical evidence, and showed
  that both clusters of driving forces are linked to the level of economic development.
  With increasing affluence, energy use per capita rises and its structure changes
  away from traditional solid fuels (coal, lignite, peat, fuelwood) toward cleaner
  fuels (gas or electricity) at the point of end-use. This structural shift combined
  with the greater emphasis on urban air quality that accompanies rising incomes
  results in a roughly inverted U (IU) pattern of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions and/or concentrations.
  Emissions rise initially (with growing per capita energy use), pass through
  a maximum, and decline at higher income levels due to structural change in the
  end-use fuel mix and also control measures for large point sources. This pattern
  emerges also from the literature on environmental Kuznets curves (e.g., World
  Bank, 1992; IIASA-WEC, 1995) and is corroborated by both longitudinal and cross-sectional
  empirical data reviewed in detail in Gr�bler (1998c). Historically, the decline
  in sulfur pollution levels was achieved simply by dispersion of pollutants (tall
  stacks policy). Subsequently, the actual emissions also started to decline,
  as a result of both structural change (substitution of solids by gas and electricity
  as end-use fuels) and sulfur reduction measures (oil product desulfurization
  and scrubbing of large point sources).</p>
<p>Emissions for 1990 reported in the scenarios reviewed in <a href="034.htm">Chapter
  2</a> and in Gr�bler (1998c) indicate a range from 55 to 91 MtS. The upper range
  is explained largely by a lack of complete coverage of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emission sources
  in long-term scenario studies and models. Lower values correspond to studies
  that include only the dominant energy sector emissions (range of 59.7 to 65.4
  MtS), and higher estimates also include other sources, most notably metallurgical
  and from biomass burning. None of the long-term scenario studies appears to
  include SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions from international bunker (shipping) fuels, estimated
  at 3 � 1 MtS in 1990 (Olivier <i>et al</i>., 1996; Corbett <i>et al</i>., 1999;
  Smith <i>et al</i>., 2000). Historical global sulfur emissions estimates are
  given in Dignon and Hameed (1989).</p>
<p>Gr�bler (1998c) also argues that SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> control and intervention policies in many
  rapidly industrializing countries (particularly those with high population densities)
  are highly likely to be phased in more quickly than the historical experience
  of Europe, North America, Japan, or Korea. This analysis is supported by existing
  policies and trends in Brazil, China, and India (Shukla <i>et al</i>., 1999;
  Rosa and Schechtman, 1996; Qian and Zhang, 1998). Most recent SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emission inventory
  data suggest that since 1990 SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emission growth has significantly slowed in
  East Asia compared to earlier forecasts, in response to the first SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> control
  measures implemented in China, South Korea and Thailand (Streets and Waldhoff,
  2000). Dadi <i>et al</i>. (1998) estimate that in 1995 about 11% (1.5 MtS of
  a total of 13.5 MtS gross emissions) of China's SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions were removed through
  various control measures.</p>
<p>The evaluation of the IS92 scenarios (Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1995) concluded
  that the projected SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in the IS92 scenarios do not reflect recent
  changes in sulfur-related environmental legislation, in particular the amendments
  to the Clean Air Act in the USA, and the Second European Sulfur Protocol. Increasingly,
  many developing countries are adopting sulfur control legislation that ranges
  from reduction of sulfur contents in oil products (e.g. China, Thailand, and
  India; see Streets <i>et al</i>., 2000), through a maximum sulfur content in
  coal (e.g. in China; see Streets and Waldhoff, 2000), to SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> controls at coal-fired
  power plants (e.g. China, South Korea, Thailand; for a review see IEA, 1999).
  For instance, an estimated 3575 MW of coal-fired electricity China is generated
  by plants already equipped with sulfur control devices (IEA, 1999).</p>

<p><a name="fig317"></a>Since publication of the IS92 scenarios a number of important new sulfur impact
  studies have become available, and analyzed in particular:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implications of acidic deposition levels of high SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions scenarios
    such as IS92a (Amann <i>et al</i>., 1995; Posch <i>et al</i>., 1996).</li>
  <li>Aggregate ecosystems impacts, especially whether critical loads for acidification
    are exceeded given deposition levels and different buffering capacities of
    soils (Amann <i>et al</i>., 1995; Posch <i>et al</i>., 1996).</li>
  <li>Direct vegetation damage, particularly on food crops (Fischer and Rosenzweig,
    1996).</li>
</ul>
<p>These studies provide further information on the impacts of high concentrations
  and deposition of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions, beyond the well-documented impacts on human
  health, ecosystems productivity, and material damages (for reviews see Crutzen
  and Graedel, 1986; WHO and UNEP, 1993; WMO, 1997). These studies are particularly
  important because they document environmental changes of high-emission scenarios
  by using detailed representations of the numerous non-linear dose-response relationships
  between emissions, atmospheric concentrations, deposition, ecosystems sensitivity
  thresholds, and impacts. All recent studies agree that unabated high SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions
  along the lines of IS92a or even above would yield high impacts not only for
  natural ecosystems and forests, but also for economically important food crops
  and human health, especially in Asia where emissions growth is projected to
  be particularly high.</p>
<p>A representative result (based on Amann <i>et al</i>., 1995) is shown in <a href="#fig317">Figure
  3-17</a>, which contrasts 1990 European sulfur deposition levels with those
  of Asia by 2050 in a high SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emission scenario (very close to IS92a). Typically,
  in such scenarios, SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in Asia alone could surpass current global
  levels as early as 2020 (Amann <i>et al</i>., 1995; Posch <i>et al</i>., 1996).
  Sulfur deposition above 5 g/m<small><sup>2</sup></small> per year occurred in Europe in 1990
  in the area of the borders of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Germany (the former
  GDR), often referred to as the "black triangle." In view of its ecological impacts
  it was officially designated by UNEP as an "ecological disaster zone." In a
  scenario such as IS92a (or even higher emissions), similar high sulfur deposition
  would occur by around 2020 over more than half of Eastern China, large parts
  of southern Korea, and some smaller parts of Thailand and southern Japan.</p>
<p>Fischer and Rosenzweig (1996) assessed the combined impacts of climate change
  and acidification of agricultural crops in Asia for such a scenario. Their overall
  conclusion was that the projected likely regional climate change would largely
  benefit agricultural output in China, whereas it would lower agricultural productivity
  on the Indian subcontinent (the combined effect of projected temperature and
  precipitation changes would have differential impacts across various crops and
  subregions). However, projected high levels of acidic deposition in China would
  reduce agricultural output to an extent that would more than offset any possible
  beneficial impacts of regional climate change. This is primarily because sulfur
  (and nitrogen) deposition, while acting as fertilizer for plant growth at lower
  deposition levels, negatively affects plant growth at higher deposition levels.
  Projections in a scenario such as IS92a are that the threshold levels will be
  surpassed between 2020 and 2050 for all major Asian food crops.<br>
