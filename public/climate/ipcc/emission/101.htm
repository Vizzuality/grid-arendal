<h4>4.4.4.1. A1 Scenarios</h4>
<p>By design (see <a href="093.htm">Section 4.3</a>) the "High Growth" scenario
  family A1 explores a world in which future economic development follows the
  patterns of the most successful historical examples of economic development
  catch-up. Free trade, continued innovation, and a stable political and social
  climate enable developing regions to access knowledge, technology, and capital.
  Combined with a rapid demographic transition, this is assumed to lead to acceleration
  in time and space of economic growth compared to the historical OECD experience
  since the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The global economy is projected to expand at an average
  annual rate of 2.9% to 2100 (see <a href="100.htm#tbl45">Table 4-5</a>), roughly
  in line with historical experience over the past 100 years (of 2.7% per year,
  see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Such growth rates are considered high
  by the current scenario literature (see <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a>). Compared
  to historical experience, however, the broad-based nature of economic development
  catch-up (i.e., no region "is left behind") is without precedent. The 2.9% per
  year economic growth rate translates into a 25-fold expansion of global GDP
  that would reach US$529 trillion by 2100.</p>
<p>As a byproduct of rapid economic development and fast demographic transition,
  income inequities between industrial and developing countries are virtually
  eradicated. Per capita income ratios are 1:1.6 in 2100, compared to a ratio
  of 1:16 in 1990 in terms of the GDP/capita difference between current developed
  (IND) and developing (DEV) regions across the four SRES regions. However, even
  if relative income differences are reduced drastically, absolute differences
  remain large, not least because of the high incomes characteristic of the A1
  scenario family (per capita income differences are also larger when considered
  at a more disaggregated level). When measured across the four SRES regions in
  1990, income per capita differences are nearly 1:40 (between ASIA and OECD90).
  Per capita income differences are yet higher for differences across countries
  or between different social strata. The poorest 20% of Bangladesh's population,
  for instance, earn per capita incomes that are a factor of 700 lower than that
  of the 20% richest Swiss population (UNDP, 1993). A distinguishing feature of
  the A1 scenarios is to explore pathways of reductions in present disparities.
  In A1, per capita income in industrial countries (IND) increases to about US$107,300
  and in now developing countries (DEV) to US$66,500. Non-OECD GDP growth rates
  rise to a peak of about 8% between 2010 to 2030 in scenario A1, and decline
  once the industrial and infrastructural bases of their economies are established.
  By and large, the A1 scenario implies a replication across all developing regions
  of the post-World War II experience of Japan and Korea or the recent economic
  development of China.</p>
<h4>4.4.4.2. Harmonized and Other A1 Scenarios<a name="4442"></a></h4>
<p>The high economic growth characteristics of the A1B marker scenario reproduce
  well in the scenarios calculated with different models. The A1B-MESSAGE scenario
  tracks the A1B marker scenario closely at the global and regional levels ("fully
  harmonized" input assumptions). At the global GDP level, most growth trajectories
  agree within a range up to 15%, except the A1v2-MiniCAM scenario (see <a href="101.htm#box45">Box
  4-5</a>)<a href="fn5.htm#22" onClick="showFootnote(5,22); return false;"><sup>22</sup></a>.
  Differences at the regional level are larger. All models with comparable regional
  aggregation levels agree well for ASIA (except A1v2- MiniCAM). Differences in
  economic growth prospects also agree well for OECD90 (except A1v2-MiniCAM).
  For REF the A1B scenarios group into two clusters - one group reproduces the
  GDP growth scenario of the A1B marker, while the other group suggests a GDP
  level by 2100 about one-third lower than that of the A1B marker. Mostly this
  reflects different assumptions used in the models on future labor productivity
  growth that have not been harmonized with the values adopted for the A1B marker
  scenario. For ALM, again one group of scenarios tracks closely the A1B marker,
  whereas other groups indicate either higher (A1B-ASF, A1B-MiniCAM) or lower
  (A1v2-MiniCAM, A1T-MARIA) GDP growth. The reasons are similar to those discussed
  above. For the SRES region REF, the different regional aggregations across the
  models required complicated "inverse" calculations on regional growth rates
  for harmonization with the respective marker scenario at the level of the aggregated
  SRES region. For ALM, such calculations were neither possible for all models
  nor considered desirable by various modeling teams, which preferred to emphasize
  the inherent uncertainties in regional economic growth perspectives even for
  an otherwise shared vision of rapid global economic growth and development catch-up.</p>
<h4>4.4.4.3. A2 Scenarios<a name="4443"></a></h4>
<p>As compared to the other SRES scenario families, the A2 world is characterized
  by relatively slower productivity growth rates and resultant lower per capita
  incomes (see <a href="100.htm#tbl46">Table 4-6</a>). Yet, the global average
  (1990-2100) growth rate in per capita income of 1.3% is still somewhat higher
  than that observed from 1970 to 1995 (1.2%; World Bank, 1998). The comparatively
  conservative assumptions on per-capita-income growth reflect both the more fragmented
  economic outlook of the A2 storyline (see <a href="092.htm">Section 4.3</a>) and the slow pace of
  the demographic transition that underlies A2's high population growth trajectory.
  The fastest growth in per capita incomes (on average over 2.3% per year) occurs
  in the ASIA region, while the slowest growth is observed in the OECD90 region
  (on average 1.0% per year). In a reversal of current short-term trends, the
  REF and ALM regions experience a stable increase of their per capita income
  levels over the 21<sup>st</sup> century at a rate that is almost twice as high as in the
  OECD90 region (see <a href="100.htm#tbl47">Table 4-7</a>). The A2 world is also
  characterized by a slow convergence of incomes among regions. Nonetheless, present
  income disparities become narrower, from a factor of 40 difference in 1990 per
  capita income levels between the richest and the poorest of the four SRES regions,
  to a factor of seven or eight by 2100. The increase of global population from
  6 to 15 billion by 2100 translates into an increase of global GDP by a factor
  of 12 over a century. The average (1990 to 2100) annual growth rate of total
  GDP is 2.2%, which is lower than the 2.9% average annual growth rate observed
  between 1970 and 1995 (World Bank, 1998) and the 4% rate observed from 1950
  to 1990 (see <a href="100.htm#tbl45">Table 4-5</a>).</p>
<h4>4.4.4.4. Harmonized and Other A2 Scenarios<a name="4444"></a></h4>
<p>Four non-marker A2 scenarios (A2-AIM, A2-IMAGE with the exception of 2050,
  A2-MiniCAM, and A2-MESSAGE) have global GDPs within 5% of the A2 marker. The
  A2-A1- MiniCAM scenario has much lower global GDP than the A2 marker, reflecting
  a different viewpoint on future labor productivity growth (see <a href="101.htm#box45">Box
  4-5</a>) and a different interpretation of the A2 scenario storyline altogether
  (see <a href="101.htm#box46">Box 4-6</a>). While this particular scenario illustrates
  important uncertainties with respect to economic growth and development catch-up
  for developing countries, it remains controversial within the writing team,
  especially as to whether it reflects the overall development tendencies captured
  in the A2 scenario storyline. Nonetheless, in view of the spirit of the SRES
  open process this contrasting scenario is presented in <a href="101.htm#box46">Box
  4-6</a>. Regional GDP growth differs more than global values across the different
  model interpretations of the A2 scenario storyline. A2-MESSAGE and A2-AIM scenarios
  are harmonized, based on the marker scenario, at the regional level also, while
  the A2- IMAGE and A2-MiniCAM scenarios have significant regional deviations
  from the A2 (ASF) marker. In particular, these scenarios assume stronger GDP/capita
  growth in the ASIA region and slower growth in the ALM and REF regions.</p>
<h4>4.4.4.5. B1 Scenarios<a name="4445"></a></h4>
<p>The B1 scenario storyline assumes high levels of social consciousness and successful
  governance that result in strong reductions in income inequalities and social
  inequity. Growth in GDP, while being substantial, is qualitatively different
  compared to that of other scenarios, as social activities and environmental
  conservation are emphasized. Concepts of "green" GDP, including socially desirable
  activities such as childcare, apply in particular in the B1 scenario and qualify
  its similarity to other scenarios in terms of monetary value of GDP. In contrast
  to the world of scenario A1, the reduction of income inequalities is not a byproduct,
  but rather the result of constant domestic and international efforts. Global
  GDP reaches US$328 trillion, which corresponds to an average annual growth rate
  of 2.5%, slightly less than the long-term historical average. Per capita income
  differences between the IND and DEV regions are reduced from 1:16 in 1990 to
  1:1.8 by 2100; income disparities within particular regions are assumed to be
  even further reduced, consistent with the thread of the B1 storyline described
  in <a href="093.htm">Section 4.3</a>. For the IMAGE model simulation, convergence
  assumptions were applied in the following domains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Technology convergence was toward the level of the productivity frontier
    region (either Japan or the US).</li>
  <li>Economic structure convergence was toward long-term sectoral shares of OECD
    economies (e.g., the US), which over the long-term implies a decline of the
    share of manufacturing sectors, and hence convergence to a service-oriented
    economy.</li>
  <li>Education convergence was to the OECD ratio of highly skilled workers within
    the total workforce.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4.4.4.6. Harmonized and Other B1 Scenarios<a name="4446"></a></h4>
<p>The global GDP trajectories are all within the proposed harmonization intervals,
  except for the B1High-MiniCAM (see <a href="101.htm#box45">Box 4-5</a>) and
  the B1-MARIA scenarios in the middle period of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. On the regional
  level, differences in GDP trajectories from different models are larger because
  of the differences in regional aggregations outlined above in the discussion
  of the A1 scenario family.</p>
<h4>4.4.4.7. B2 Scenarios<a name="4447"></a></h4>
<p>Global GDP in B2 is assumed to increase by more than a factor of 10 during
  the 21<sup>st</sup> century, or at an average annual growth rate of 2.2%. This growth rate
  of GDP is similar to the median GDP growth in the scenario database reviewed
  in <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a>. Stabilization of global population at less
  than double current levels, as projected in the UN median scenario adopted for
  B2, combined with a sustained pace of development implies that a B2 world generally
  achieves high levels of affluence. Average per capita income reaches about US$18,000
  by 2100 in the developing countries, which exceeds the current OECD averages.
  In comparison, average per capita GDP reaches US$54,400 by 2100 in the developed
  regions, which corresponds to an income ratio of about 3:1 between industrial
  (IND) and now developing (DEV) regions, a considerable improvement in interregional
  equity by 2100 (Riahi and Roehrl, 2000). Nonetheless, given the nature of the
  B2 scenario storyline (<a href="093.htm">Section 4.3</a>), per capita income
  differences among the world regions are higher than those in the A1 and B1 scenarios,
  but much smaller than those in A2.</p>
<h4><a name="4448"></a>4.4.4.8. Harmonized and Other B2 Scenarios</h4>
<p>The economic growth paths described by the B2-MESSAGE marker scenario are closely
  tracked by the B2 quantifications derived from alternative models at the global
  level, with the exception of the B2-IMAGE scenario, which is slightly below<a href="fn5.htm#23" onClick="showFootnote(5,23); return false;"><sup>23</sup></a>.
  Differences at the regional level are larger. For B2- ASF and B2-MiniCAM, GDP
  is higher in the ALM and lower in the ASIA regions, respectively, compared to
  the B2 marker scenario and its "fully harmonized" companion B2-AIM. The latter
  - like all AIM scenarios - was developed by an interdisciplinary group of researchers
  from different countries in the ASIA region and therefore helps to guide readers
  as to which scenario better reflects regional perspectives.</p>

      <p><b>Box 4-5: Labor Productivity Growth Rates in the SRES Scenarios</b>
      </p>
      <p>The high income growths assumed in the scenarios, especially in the A1
	and B1 scenario families, imply large labor productivity increases. According
	to one member of the writing team such increases might not be plausible,
	but the other members find the assumptions plausible, especially in view
	of historical precedents. In line with IPCC practice, the dissenting view
	is elaborated here. Its corresponding implications on scenario quantifications
	are discussed with one example in <a href="101.htm#box46">Box 4-6</a>.</p>
      <p>Long-term economic growth rates can be expressed as the sum of the labor
	force growth rate and the growth rate of labor productivity. This framework
	can be used to understand more clearly the kind of technological and demographic
	assumptions present in the SRES scenarios. A simplified measure of labor
	productivity, the average economic output per member of the labor force,
	is used to examine the SRES scenarios.</p>
      <p>Productivity assumptions are not comparable across the different models
	used to quantify the SRES emissions scenarios, so these issues were examined
	by running quantifications of the SRES scenarios with the MiniCAM model.
	Population projections were taken as exogenous inputs and regional GDP
	growth paths were taken to be similar to those in the SRES marker scenarios.
	From these, the implied labor force productivity growth rates are determined
	using assumptions about labor force participation rates. In these calculations,
	total labor force participation rates were assumed to be asymptotic to
	a participation rate of 80% for a working age population of all persons
	aged 15 to 65.</p>
      <p>The result of this exercise is that increases in labor force productivity
	range between 0.79% and 5.85% per year (calculated for the periods 1990
	to 2020, 2020 to 2050, and 2050 to 2100) for the four scenario families
	and four SRES macro-regions considered separately. This compares with
	historical experience between 1970 and 1995 of growth in regional labor
	force productivity of 0.69 to 4.13% per year and the longer-term productivity
	growth rates of between 1.1 and 7.7% per year. The implied future growth
	in global labor productivity for the MiniCAM scenario calculations ranges
	between 1.12% and 3.49% per year for the four scenarios (again from 1990
	to 2020, 2020 to 2050, and 2050 to 2100). The historical growth in global
	labor force productivity between 1970 and 1995 was 1.04% per year. Historical
	rates of GDP per capita growth (a macro-economic proxy for labor productivity;
	see <a href="058.htm#tbl32">Table 3-2</a> and <a href="100.htm#tbl47">Table
	4-7</a>) were 1.1% per year between 1980 and 1992 and 2.5% per year between
	1950 and 1980.</p>
      <p>At the upper end of the these ranges, the SRES scenarios exhibit a growth
	in global labor force productivity that is higher than recent historical
	global experience, particularly for the SRES regions REF and ALM. This
	indicates that none of the four SRES scenario families envisions a recurrence
	of the current economic crisis in Eastern Europe and Russia or a recurrence
	of the "lost decade" of negative GDP per capita growth in Africa or Latin
	America. In addition, the period over which some developing regions exhibit
	high growth rates in these scenarios is longer than any historical record
	of high growth rates. However, there is limited analogous historical experience,
	as Japan is the only country that can be said to have completed such an
	economic "catch-up."</p>
      <p>The assumptions on labor force participation used in the calculations
	reported in this box result in a decline in the growth of the labor force
	through the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The total labor force actually declines in all
	regions for the last simulation period. This reflects the demographic
	pattern of an overall decline in the population and the assumed stability
	in labor force participation rates. However, the scenarios describe generally
	affluent worlds in which people live longer. Thus, the labor participation
	patterns are likely to change with respect to current practices. People
	may work much longer over their lifetime, but this trend is countered
	by the probable need for an increase in education levels, which act to
	delay entry into the labor force. Pushing the asymptotic labor participation
	rates upward from the value assumed here results in only a small increase
	in total productivity, on the order of 0.2% per year.</p>
      <p>The high economic growth branches (A1 and B1 families) of the SRES scenarios
	may represent upper bounds for future increases in labor productivity.
	Different assumptions about future rates of labor force participation
	do not appear to change this conclusion substantially. These scenarios
	essentially assume that, within the next few decades, most developing
	regions will experience an extended period of successful economic development
	analogous to the historical experience of Japan and the "Asian Tigers."
	An alternative view on future labor productivity growth is provided in
	a number of scenarios developed with the MiniCAM model, most notably A1v2-MiniCAM
	and the "transitional" scenario A2-A1-MiniCAM (see <a href="101.htm#box46">Box
	4-6</a>). In these scenarios global economic output is between 20% (A2-A1-MiniCAM)
	and 36% (A1v2-MiniCAM) lower than in the other scenarios of their respective
	scenario families.</p>

      <p><b>Box 4-6: Possible Transitions between Scenario Families: The A2-A1-MiniCAM
	Scenario </b></p>
      <p>The four scenario storylines have been stylized as global socio-economic
	developments that evolve in different directions, but globally and continuously.
	In reality, different regions may follow the developments pictured in
	the scenarios in different time periods. For example, the world may in
	reality develop according to one of the storylines and after some time
	move toward another. As an illustration of this, one scenario (A2-A1-MiniCAM)
	was elaborated by a member of the writing team. This scenario is described
	here even though some members of the writing team considered its inclusion
	undesirable and possibly confusing as it was submitted too late to have
	the team thoroughly discuss its consistency<a href="fn5.htm#24" onClick="showFootnote(5,24); return false;"><sup>24</sup></a>
	and to clarify its relationship to the four storylines. However, the point
	that in reality transitions between scenarios are possible is a valid
	one and the contrasting viewpoint is presented here for consideration
	of the reader, following IPCC practice. </p>
      <p>The A2-A1-MiniCAM transition scenario explores a world in which the prerequisites
	for development, such as education, effective institutions, and high saving
	rates, take some time to develop, so that rapid development does not begin
	to occur until between 2020 and 2050 depending on the region. In this
	scenario, total GDP by 2100 is below the median of the historical scenario
	data base and, with the population 20% higher than the current median
	UN forecast, average per capita income is at the lower end of the historical
	data base range. In such a relatively poor world the economic structure
	is more sensitive to environmental change than in the marker scenario,
	and the institutional structure is less capable. Thus, the impacts of
	climate change are larger and the ability to adapt less than those in
	the A1 world. The primary driving forces for the A2-A1-MiniCAM transition
	scenario follow the logic of this story line, as detailed below.</p>
      <p>Population is lower in the A2-A1-MiniCAM scenario variant than in the
	A2 marker, since its total completed fertility early in the 21<sup>st</sup> century
	is lower. This reflects the continued rapid historical declines and leads
	to slower population growth rates than in the population scenario adopted
	for the A2 scenario family. Total completed fertility declines slowly
	in the forecast period with a long-term asymptotic level of 2.25 for all
	regions, which results in a global population that is still growing by
	over 100 million per year in 2100. The values for migration and death
	rates used to generate the population trajectory follow those of the UN
	median forecast. The population scenario of A2-A1-MiniCAM is quite close
	to the UN medium population projection (see the discussion of the B2 scenario
	family below) until about 2060. Thereafter, however, A2-A1-MiniCAM's population
	scenario continues to grow linearly to about 12 billion, whereas the UN
	median projection stabilizes at about 10 billion by 2080 and slightly
	declines thereafter.</p>
      <p>The regionally heterogeneous ("delayed") pattern of development of the
	precursors to rapid economic growth (e.g. education) means that some developing
	regions experience stagnant or very slowly growth in per capita incomes
	well into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. As regions begin rapid development they approach
	and follow the average OECD labor productivity pattern, so GDP growth
	rates accelerate post-2050 and average nearly 2.5% per year over the second
	half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. GDP thus rises more slowly early in the 21st
	century in this scenario, reaching just over US$50 trillion by 2050. After
	2050, GDP rises more rapidly to reach just under US$200 trillion in 2100.
      </p>
      <p>Per capita final energy demands are limited by per capita income, and
	rise only as economic growth occurs. After growing slowly until 2050,
	per capita energy demands grow by more than 1.5% annually to reach 120
	GJ per capita by 2100. With increases in the efficiency with which services
	are provided, this results in a global average level of energy services
	similar to that currently seen in Western Europe. Global per capita income
	and energy use by 2100 approach that of Western Europe in 1990. Therefore
	global energy intensities in 2100 approach those of Western Europe in
	1990, a value lower than in other scenarios but in line with current observations.
      </p>
      <p>Natural gas and oil dominate the primary energy system, and contribute
	slightly more than half of the primary energy. Non-fossil sources contribute
	about 30% of total primary energy, with coal providing the remainder.
	Total fossil energy carbon emissions reach 22 GtC by 2100. Sulfur controls
	are delayed in this implementation until economic growth takes off after
	2050. With high levels of fossil fuel use, and relatively low rates of
	control, sulfur emissions are about ten million tons higher in 2100 than
	they are today. </p>
      <p>The relatively slow growth in output and productivity in the economy
	in general is mirrored in the agricultural sector, with lower growth in
	agricultural productivity until post 2050. The large population complicates
	this problem, leading to large-scale expansion of agricultural lands and
	a resultant decrease in forested and unmanaged lands, especially in developing
	regions. Land-use changes do not offset any of these emissions, since
	the relatively high population, the rapid growth in income, and the growth
	in modern biomass result in essentially zero carbon emissions from land
	use and agriculture, rather than the substantial uptake seen in many other
	scenarios.</p>
