<h2>3.6 Other Gas Emissions<a name="anc1"></a></h2>
<h3>3.6.1. Introduction<a name="anc2"></a></h3>
<p>Driving forces of emissions other than CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> or those of agriculture or land-use
  changes are discussed here. The direct GHGs N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> are discussed first,
  followed by the indirect GHGs, which include sulfur and the ozone precursors
  NO<sub>x</sub>, CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Finally, the many various powerful
  GHGs, including ozone-depleting substances (ODS), are discussed.</p>
<p>The sources and sinks for these gases continue to be highly uncertain. Little
  research has been carried out to evaluate the influences of socio-economic and
  technological driving forces on long-term emission trends of these gases. As
  a rule, future emissions of these gases are included in long-term emission models
  on the basis of simple relationships to aggregate economic or sector-specific
  activity drivers, not least because individual source strengths continue to
  be highly uncertain. Notable exceptions are emissions of sulfur and ODS, which
  have been more intensively studied in connection with non-climate policy analysis
  in the domains of regional acidification and stratospheric ozone depletion.</p>
<h3><a name="anc3"></a>3.6.2. Nitrous Oxide</h3>
<p>Natural and agricultural soils are the dominant sources of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions, so
  future emission levels are governed by the land-use changes and changes in agricultural
  output and practices discussed in <a href="077.htm">Section 3.5.2</a>. Nevertheless,
  other sources are also important and are discussed here.</p>
<p>The dominant industrial sources are the production of HNO<sub>3</sub> and adipic acid.
  The key driver for the production of HNO<sub>3</sub> is the demand for fertilizer. Hence
  this emission source is closely related to the agricultural production driving
  forces discussed in <a href="076.htm#anc1">Section 3.5</a>, as well as to improvements
  in production technologies. Adipic acid, (CH<sub>2</sub>) 4 (COOH)2 , is a feedstock for
  nylon production and one of the largest-volume synthetic chemicals produced
  in the world each year - current annual global production is 1.8 million metric
  tons (Stevens III, 1993). Production has an associated by-product of 0.3 kg
  N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O/kg adipic acid for unabated emission, which at present results in a global
  emission of about 0.4 MtN as N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O annually. Emissions mostly arise in the OECD
  countries, which accounted for some 95% of global adipic acid production in
  1990 (Davis and Kemp, 1991). Fenhann (2000) reviews the (sparse) scenario literature
  and concludes that future emissions will be determined mostly by two variables
  - demand growth as a result of growth in economic activity and progressively
  phased-in emission controls.</p>
<p>By the early 1990s, it was estimated that about one-third of OECD emissions
  had been abated (Stevens III, 1993). This abatement is an accidental result
  of the treatment of flue-gases in a reductive furnace (thermal destruction)
  to reduce NOx emissions, which coincidentally also converts about 99% of the
  N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O into nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>). In other regions only about 20% of emissions had
  been abated by the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Major adipic acid producers worldwide have agreed to substantially reduce N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O
  emissions by 1996 to 1998. In July 1991 they formed an inter-industry group
  to share information on old and new technologies developed for N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O abatement,
  such as improved thermal destruction, conversion into nitric oxide for recycling,
  and the promising low-temperature N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O catalytic decomposition into N<sub>2</sub> currently
  being developed by DuPont. The introduction of all three technologies could
  result in a 99% reduction of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions from adipic acid production (Storey,
  1996). They are expected to be introduced at plants owned by Asahi (Japan),
  BASF and Bayer (Germany), DuPont (US), and Rh�ne-Poulenc (France) (<i>Chemical
  Week</i>, 1994). After the planned changes, US producers will have abated over
  90% of the N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions from adipic acid production. In recent years nylon-6.6
  production dropped in the US, Western Europe, and Japan, largely in response
  to capacity and production in other Asian countries. By 2000 production is expected
  to recover in these countries (Storey, 1996).</p>
<p>Another major source of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O is the transport sector. Gasoline vehicles without
  catalytic converters have very low, sometimes immeasurably small, emissions
  of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O. However, vehicles equipped with three-way catalytic converters have
  N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions that range from 0.01 to 0.1 g/km in new catalysts, and from 0.16
  to 0.22 g/km in aging catalysts (IPCC, 1996). Emission levels also depend on
  precise engine running conditions. At the upper end of the emission range from
  aging catalysts, N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions contribute around 25% of the in-use global warming
  impact of driving (Michaelis <i>et al</i>., 1996).</p>
<p>The introduction of catalytic converters as a pollution control measure in
  the majority of industrialized countries is resulting in a substantial increase
  in N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions from gasoline vehicles. Several Annex I countries include projections
  of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O from this source in their national communications to the UNFCCC, using
  a variety of projection methods (for example, Environment Canada, 1997; UNFCCC,
  1997; VROM, 1997). The projections from these counties differ substantially
  in the contribution that transport is expected to make to their national N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O
  emissions in 2020, ranging from about 10% in France to over 25% in Canada. They
  anticipate that mitigation measures will be much more effective in reducing
  industrial and agricultural emissions of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O than mobile source emissions. Indeed,
  little research has been carried out to identify catalytic converter technologies
  that result in lower N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions. However, emissions are likely to be lower
  in countries that require regular emission inspections and replacement of faulty
  pollution control equipment.</p>
<h3>3.6.3. Methane<a name="anc1"></a></h3>
<p>Agricultural and land-use change emission drivers are discussed in <a href="077.htm">Section
  3.5.2</a>. The other major sources are from the use of fossil fuels and the
  disposal of waste, for which the driving forces are briefly reviewed here. The
  earlier literature is reviewed in Barnes and Edmonds (1990). A more detailed
  recent literature review is given in Gregory (1998).</p>
<p>Emissions from the extraction, processing, and use of fossil fuels will be
  driven by future fossil fuel use. CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions from venting during oil and
  gas production may decrease because of efforts to reduce them (IGU, 1997b).
  Flaring and venting volumes from oil and gas operations peaked in 1976 to 1978,
  but a gradual reduction in volumes of gas flared and vented has occurred over
  the past 20 years (Boden <i>et al</i>., 1994, Marland <i>et al</i>., 1998; Stern
  and Kaufmann, 1998). Shell International Ltd. (1998) estimated a reduction in
  its own emissions from venting by 1 MtCH<small><sub>4</sub></small> per year to 0.367 MtCH<small><sub>4</sub></small> in the five
  years to 1997. The IEA Greenhouse Gases R&D Programme (1997) notes that emission
  reductions from the oil and gas sector would yield a high economic return. Additionally,
  new natural gas developments generally use the latest technology and are almost
  leak free compared to older systems. Taking all these factors into account,
  it seems plausible that CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions from the oil and gas sector should fall
  as the 21st century progresses. Nonetheless, the primary driver (oil and gas
  production) is likely to expand significantly in the future, depending on resource
  availability and technological change. A representative range from the literature,
  for example the scenarios described in Nakicenovic <i>et al</i>. (1998a),
  indicates substantial uncertainty in which future levels of oil and gas production
  could range between 130 and some 900 EJ. Assuming a constant emission factor,
  future CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions from oil and gas could range from a decline compared to
  current levels to a fourfold increase. With the more likely assumption of declining
  emission factors, future emission levels would be somewhat lower than suggested
  by this range.</p>
<p>The concentrations of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> in coal seams are low close to the surface, and hence
  emissions from surface mining are also low (IEA CIAB, 1992). Concentrations
  at a few hundred meters or deeper can be more significant; releases from these
  depths are normally associated with underground mining. Emissions per ton of
  coal mined can vary widely both from country to country and at adjacent mines
  within a country (IEA Greenhouse Gases R&D Programme, 1996a). CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> mixed with
  air in the right proportions is an explosive mixture and a danger to miners.
  Measures to capture and drain the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> are common in many countries - the captured
  CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, if of adequate concentration, can be a valuable energy source. The techniques
  currently used reduce total emissions by about 10%. Many older, deeper coal
  mines in Europe are being closed, which will reduce emissions. Replacement coal
  mines tend to be in exporting countries with low cost reserves near the surface,
  so the emissions will be low. For the future, emissions will depend principally
  on the proportion of coal production from deep mines and on total coal production.</p>
<p>A representative range of future coal production scenarios given in Nakicenovic
  <i>et al</i>. (1998a) indicates a very wide range of uncertainty. Future coal
  production levels could range anywhere from 14 to well over 700 EJ, between
  a sevenfold decrease to an eightfold increase compared to 1990 levels. Conversely,
  CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> capture, either during mining or prior to mining, not only reduces risk
  to miners but also provides a valuable energy source. Thus, rising levels of
  CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> capture for non-climate reasons are likely to characterize the 21st century.
  This would in particular apply to high coal production scenarios, in which most
  of the coal will need to come from deep mining once the easily accessible surface
  mine deposits have become exhausted. Growth in future emissions from coal mining
  is therefore likely to be substantially lower than growth in coal production.</p>
<p>Domestic and some industrial wastes contain organic matter that emits a combination
  of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> on decomposition (IEA Greenhouse Gases R&D Programme, 1996b).
  If oxygen is present, most of the waste degrades by aerobic micro-organisms
  and the main product is CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>. If no oxygen is present, different micro-organisms
  become active and a mixture of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> is produced. Decay by this mechanism
  can take months or even years (US EPA, 1994). Traditionally, waste has been
  dumped in open pits and this is still the main practice in most developing countries.
  Thus, oxygen is present and the main decay product is CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>. In recent decades,
  health and local environmental concerns in developed countries have resulted
  in better waste management, with lined pits and a cap of clay, for example,
  added regularly over newer dumps. This prevents fresh supplies of oxygen becoming
  available so the subsequent decay process is anaerobic and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> is produced.
  Williams (1993) notes that landfill sites are complex and highly variable biologic
  systems and many factors can lead to a wide variability in CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> production. For
  the future, increasing wealth and urbanization in developing countries may lead
  to more managed landfill sites and to more CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> production. However, the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>
  produced can be captured and utilized as a valuable energy source, or at least
  flared for pollution and safety reasons; indeed, this is a legal requirement
  in the USA for large landfills. Future emissions are therefore unlikely to evolve
  linearly with population growth and waste generation, but the scenario literature
  is extremely sparse on this subject - the major source remains the previous
  IS92 scenario series (Pepper <i>et al</i>., 1992).</p>
<p>Different methods are used to treat domestic sewage, some of which involve
  anaerobic decomposition and the production of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>. Again, capture and use of
  some of the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> produced limits emissions. For the future, emissions will depend
  on the extension of sewage treatment in developing countries, the extent to
  which the techniques used enhance or limit CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> production, and the extent to
  which the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> produced is captured and used.</p>
<p>Several authors, including Rudd et al. (1993) and Fearnside (1995), note that
  some hydroelectric schemes result in emissions of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> from decaying vegetation
  trapped by water as the dams fill; these emissions climatically exceed those
  of a thermopower plant delivering the same electricity. Rosa <i>et al</i>. (1996),
  Rosa and Sch�ffer (1994), and Gagnon and van de Vate (1997) point out that the
  two schemes discussed by Rudd et al. (1993) and Fearnside (1995) may be exceptional,
  with very large reservoir surface areas, a high density of organic matter, and
  low power output. Gagnon and van de Vate (1997) estimate the combined CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and
  N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions from hydroelectric schemes at 5.5 gC equivalent per kWh compared
  to a range of 80 to 200 gC equivalent per kWh for a modern fossil power station
  (Rogner and Khan, 1998); that is, hydroelectric power emits less than 3% and
  7%, respectively. While some GHG emissions from new hydroelectric schemes are
  expected in the future, especially in tropical settings (Galy-Lacaux <i>et al</i>.,
  1999), in the absence of more comprehensive field data, such schemes are regarded
  as a lower source of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions compared to those of other energy sector
  or agricultural activities. Hydroelectric power is therefore not treated as
  a separate emission category in SRES.</p>
<p>In summary, numerous factors could lead to increases in emissions of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> in
  the future, primarily related to the expansion of agricultural production and
  greater fossil fuel use. Recent studies also identify a number of processes
  and trends that could reduce CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emission factors and hence may lead to reduced
  emissions in the future. These trends are not yet sufficiently accounted for
  in the literature, in which CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emission factors typically are held constant.
  The overall consequence is to introduce additional uncertainty into projections,
  as the future evolution of such emission factors is unclear. However, from the
  above discussion, the least likely future is one of constant emission factors
  and the range of future emissions is likely to be lower than those projected
  in previous scenarios with comparable growth in primary activity drivers.</p>
