<h1><a name="anc1"></a>9. Greenhouse Gases and Sulfur Emissions</h1>
<p>The SRES scenarios generally cover the full range of GHG and sulfur emissions
  consistent with the storylines and the underlying range of driving forces from
  studies in the literature, as documented in the SRES database. This section
  summarizes the emissions of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> ,CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> , and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> . For simplicity, only these
  three important gases are presented separately, following the more detailed
  exposition in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a> (see <a href="021.htm#tblts4a">Table
  TS-4</a> for a summary of the ranges of emissions across the scenario groups).</p>
<h1><a name="anc2"></a>9.1. Carbon Dioxide Emissions</h1>
<h3><a name="anc3"></a>9.1.1. Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Their Driving Forces</h3>
<p><a href="#figts6a">Figure TS-6</a> illustrates the CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions across the
  SRES scenarios in relation to each of the three main scenario driving forces
  - global population, gross world product and primary energy requirements. The
  general tendencies across the driving forces are consistent with the underlying
  literature. All else being equal, the higher future global populations, higher
  gross world product, or higher primary energy requirements would be associated
  with higher emissions. However, it is important to note that the range of emissions
  is large across the whole range of driving forces considered in SRES, indicating
  the magnitude of the uncertainty associated with emission scenarios. For instance,
  emissions can range widely for any given level of future population (e.g. between
  5 to 20 GtC in case of a low population scenario of seven billion by 2100).
  Conversely, emissions in the range of 20 GtC are possible with global population
  levels ranging from seven to 15 billion by 2100. While the SRES scenarios do
  not map all possibilities, they do indicate general tendencies, with an uncertainty
  range consistent with the underlying literature. This emphasizes an important
  SRES conclusion: alternative combinations of main scenario driving forces can
  lead to similar levels of GHGs emissions by the end of the 21st century. Alternatively,
  similar future worlds with respect to socio-economic developments can result
  in wide differences in future GHGs emissions, primarily as a result of alternative
  technological developments. This suggests that technology is at least as important
  a driving force of future GHG emissions as population and economic development
  across the set of 40 SRES scenarios.</p>

<p><a href="#figts7">Figure TS-7</a> illustrates the range of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions of
  the SRES scenarios against the background of all the IS92 scenarios and other
  emissions scenarios from the literature documented in the SRES scenario database
  (blue shaded area). The range of future emissions is very large so that the
  highest scenarios envisage a tenfold increase of global emissions by 2100 while
  the lowest have emissions lower than today.</p>
<p>The literature includes scenarios with additional climate initiatives and policies,
  which are also referred to as mitigation or intervention scenarios. As shown
  in <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a>, many ambiguities are associated with the
  classification of emissions scenarios into those that include additional climate
  initiatives and those that do not. Many cannot be classified in this way on
  basis of the information available from the SRES scenario database and the published
  literature.</p>
<p><a href="#figts7">Figure TS-7a</a> indicates the ranges of emissions in 2100
  from scenarios that apparently include additional climate initiatives (designated
  as "intervention" emissions range), those that do not ("non-intervention"),
  and those that cannot be assigned to either of these two categories ("non-classified").
  This classification is based on the subjective evaluation of the scenarios in
  the database by the members of the writing team and is explained in <a href="011.htm#anc2">Section
  5</a> and in <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a> in greater detail. It should be
  noted that the distributions of emissions of scenarios from the literature is
  asymmetric (see the emissions histogram in <a href="137.htm#fig65">Figure 6-5</a>
  in <a href="131.htm">Chapter 6</a>) and that the thin tail that extends above
  30 GtC by 2100 includes only a few scenarios.<br>
  <span ></span>
</p>
<p><a href="#figts7">Figure TS-7a</a> shows the ranges of emissions of the four
  families (vertical bars next to each of the four marker scenarios), which illustrate
  that the scenario groups by themselves cover a large portion of the overall
  scenario distribution. Together, they cover much of the range of future emissions,
  both with respect to the scenarios in the literature and all SRES scenarios.
  Adding all other scenarios increases the covered range. For example, the SRES
  scenarios span jointly from the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile to just above the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile
  of the distribution of energy and industry emissions scenarios from the literature.
  This illustrates again that they only exclude the most extreme emissions scenarios
  found in the literature that are situated out in the tails of the distribution.
  What is perhaps more important is that each of the four scenario families covers
  a substantial part of this distribution. This leads to a substantial overlap
  in the emissions ranges of the four scenario families. In other words, a similar
  quantification of driving forces can lead to a wide range of future emissions
  and a given level of future emissions can result from different combinations
  of driving forces. This result is of fundamental importance for the assessments
  of climate change impacts and possible mitigation and adaptation strategies.
  Thus, it warrants some further discussion.</p>
<p>Another interpretation is that a given combination of the main driving forces,
  such as the population and economic growth, is not sufficient to determine the
  future emissions paths. Different modeling approaches and different specifications
  of other scenario assumptions overshadow the influence of the main driving forces.
  A particular combination of driving forces, such as specified in the A1 scenario
  family, is associated with a whole range of possible emission paths from energy
  and industry. The nature of climate change impacts and adaptation and mitigation
  strategies would be fundamentally different depending on whether emissions are
  high or low, given a particular combination of scenario driving forces. Thus,
  the implication is that the whole range needs to be considered in the assessments
  of climate change, from high emissions and driving forces to low ones.</p>
<p> The A1 scenario family explored variations in energy systems most explicitly
  and hence covers the largest part of the scenario distribution shown in <a href="#figts7">Figure
  TS-7a</a>, from the 95 th to just above the 10th percentile. The A1 scenario
  family includes four groups of scenarios that explore different structures of
  future energy systems, from carbon-intensive development paths to high rates
  of decarbonization. Two of the fossil-intensive groups were merged into one
  group, as in SPM, resulting in three A1 groups. All A1 groups otherwise share
  the same assumptions about the main driving forces (see <a href="131.htm">Chapter
  6</a> and for further detail <a href="089.htm">Chapters 4</a> and <a href="114.htm">5</a>).
  This indicates that different structures of the energy system can lead to basically
  the same variation in future emissions as generated by different combinations
  of the other main driving forces - population, economic activities, and energy
  consumption levels. The implication is that decarbonization of energy systems
  - the shift from carbon-intensive to less carbon-intensive and carbon-free sources
  of energy - is of similar importance in determining the future emissions paths
  as other driving forces. Sustained decarbonization requires the development
  and successful diffusion of new technologies. Thus investments in new technologies
  during the coming decades might have the same order of influence on future emissions
  as population growth, economic development, and levels of energy consumption
  taken together.</p>
<p><a href="#figts7">Figure TS-7b</a> shows that CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from deforestation
  peak in many SRES scenarios after several decades and subsequently gradually
  decline. This pattern is consistent with many scenarios in the literature and
  can be associated with slowing population growth and increasing agricultural
  productivity. These allow a reversal of current deforestation trends, leading
  to eventual CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> sequestration. Emissions decline fastest in the B1 family. Only
  in the A2 family do net anthropogenic CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from land use remain positive
  through to 2100. As was the case for energy-related emissions, CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions
  related to land-use in the A1 family cover the widest range. The range of land-use
  emissions across the IS92 scenarios is narrower in comparison.</p>
