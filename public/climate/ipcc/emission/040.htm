<p><i><a name="anc1"></a>2.4.1. Carbon Dioxide Emissions Ranges (continued)</i><br>
</p>
<p>Some additional information about the range of future emissions can be obtained
  by examining the results from detailed analyses (see, e.g., Alcamo et al., 1996,
  1998) conducted by Nordhaus and Yohe (1983), Edmonds et al. (1986), de Vries
  et al. (1994), and Manne and Richels (1994). These analyses confirm that the
  range is very large. The analysis of Edmonds et al. (1986) shows a range of
  87 to 2 GtC by the year 2070 for the 95<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> percentiles, respectively;
  the range is from 27 to 4 GtC for the 75<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> percentiles. Nordhaus and
  Yohe (1983) estimated the range to be from 55 to 7 GtC for the 95<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup>
  percentiles, and from 27 to 12 GtC for the 75<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> percentiles, respectively.
  In contrast, de Vries <i>et al</i>. (1994) estimated a fundamentally smaller
  range of 24 to 11 GtC by 2050 for the 95th and 5th percentiles, respectively,
  but they standardized some of the scenario assumptions, such as population and
  economic growth, relative to a base case.</p>
<p>The SRES team also applied the criteria presented in <a href="036.htm">Section
  2.2</a> to identify intervention scenarios from among the CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>
  emissions scenarios in the database. Of the 190 scenarios that reported CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>
  emissions through the year 2100, 62 were classified as intervention scenarios
  and 88 as non-intervention scenarios. For 40 scenarios the information available
  was insufficient to determine whether or not they included any climate policies.
  These are referred to as non-classified scenarios. The statistics for these
  three scenario samples are given in <a href="#tbl22">Table 2-2</a>. The medians
  for these samples are also shown in Figures <a href="#fig21c">2-1c</a> to <a href="040.htm#fig21f">2-1f</a>.
  The analysis indicates that many of the 88 non-intervention scenarios are emulations
  of IS92 scenarios, and many of these are emulations of IS92a. For example, 42
  of the 88 non-intervention scenarios were produced by EMF-14, of which 25 are
  based on IS92a.</p>
<p><a href="#fig21c">Figure 2-1c</a> shows spaghetti curves for the non-intervention
  scenarios found in <a href="#tbl22">Table 2-2</a>. In the year 2100 these scenarios
  cover almost the same range (1.2 GtC to 59.4 GtC) as does the entire sample
  of 190 scenarios (-2.1 GtC to 59.4 GtC). The sample of non-intervention scenarios
  includes some that have very low emissions, which suggests that emissions can
  be low even in the absence of explicit climate intervention policies. However,
  the non-intervention sample also has a higher median than the total sample -
  21 GtC in 2100 compared with the 15.7 GtC median found in the total sample.
  The lower median of the total sample may result from downward pressure exerted
  by the inclusion of some intervention scenarios in the total sample. However,
  it could also result from the influence of IS92a-like scenarios (upward pressure)
  in the non-intervention sample (see also <a href="040.htm#fig21f">Figure 2-1f</a>).</p>

<p>
  Finally, the IS92a scenario (Leggett <i>et al</i>., 1992; Pepper <i>et al</i>.,
  1992) appears to have influenced subsequent emissions scenarios in the literature.
  The median population, gross world product, and primary energy consumption trends
  in many scenarios in the literature track very closely the developments in the
  IS92a scenario (Morita and Lee, 1998). This is because IS92a constituted a reference
  baseline that was emulated by different modeling groups in a number of scenario
  evaluation and comparison activities. <a href="#fig21f">Figure 2-1f</a> shows
  the set of 35 IS92a-like scenarios that could be classified from the set of
  non-intervention scenarios. As these scenarios appear to emulate IS92a, they
  show little variation around the median of 20.3 GtC, which is about the emission
  level in that scenario (20.4 GtC) in 2100.</p>
