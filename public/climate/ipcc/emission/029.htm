	  be influenced by the use of IS92a as a reference for many subsequent
	  studies). The emissions paths indicate a wide range of future emissions.
	  The range is also large in the base year 1990 and is indicated by an
	  "error" bar. To separate the variation due to base-year specification
	  from different future paths, emissions are indexed for the year 1990,
	  when actual global energy-related and industrial CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions were
	  about 6 GtC. The coverage of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions sources may vary across
	  the 256 different scenarios from the database included in the figure.
	  The scenario samples used vary across the time steps (for 1990 256 scenarios,
	  for 2020 and 2030 247, for 2050 220, and for 2100 190 scenarios). Also
	  shown, as vertical bars on the right of the figure, are the ranges of
	  emissions in 2100 for scenarios from the literature that apparently
	  include additional climate initiatives (designated as "intervention"
	  scenarios emissions range), those that do not ("non-intervention"),
	  and those that cannot be assigned to either of these two categories
	  ("non-classified"). This classification is based on the subjective evaluation
	  of the scenarios in the database by the members of the writing team
	  and is explained in <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a>. Data sources: Morita
	  and Lee, 1998a, 1998b; Nakicenovic et al., 1998.</p>

<h3><a name="anc2"></a>1.7.1. Literature Review and Analysis</h3>
<p>The first step in formulation of the SRES emissions scenarios was to review
  both the published scenario literature and the development of the scenario database
  accessible through the web site (<a target="_top" href="http://www-cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/db/ipcc.html">www-cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/db/ipcc.html</a>).
  Chapters <a href="034.htm">2</a> and <a href="049.htm">3</a> give a more detailed
  description of the literature review and analysis. <a href="#fig13">Figure 1-3</a>
  shows the global energy-related CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emission paths from the database as "spaghetti"
  curves for the period to 2100 against the background of the historical emissions
  from 1900 to 1990. These curves are plotted against an index on the vertical
  axis rather than as absolute values because of the large differences and discrepancies
  for the values assumed for the base year 1990. These sometimes arise from genuine
  differences among the scenarios (e.g., different data sources, definitions)
  and sometimes from different base years assumed in the analysis or in alternative
  calibrations <sup><small><a href="fn2.htm#7" onClick="showFootnote(2,7); return false;">7</a></small></sup>.
  The differences among the scenarios in the specification of the base year illustrate
  the large genuine scientific and data uncertainty that surrounds emissions and
  their main driving forces captured in the scenarios. The literature includes
  scenarios with additional climate polices, which are sometimes referred to as
  mitigation or intervention scenarios. There are many ambiguities associated
  with the classification of emissions scenarios into those that include additional
  climate initiatives and those that do not. Many cannot be classified in this
  way on basis of the information available from the database. <a href="#fig13">Figure
  1-3</a> indicates the ranges of emissions in 2100 from scenarios that apparently
  include additional climate initiatives (designated as intervention emissions
  range), those that do not (non-intervention) and those that cannot be assigned
  to either of these two categories (non-classified). This classification is based
  on the subjective evaluation of the scenarios in the database by the members
  of the writing team and is explained in <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a>. The
  range of the whole sample of scenarios has significant overlap with the range
  of those that cannot be classified and they share virtually the same median
  (15.7 and 15.2 GtC in 2100, respectively) but the non-classified scenarios do
  not cover the high part of the range. Also, the range of the scenarios that
  apparently do not include climate polices (non-intervention) has considerable
  overlap with the other two ranges (lower bound is higher) but with a significantly
  higher median (of 21.3 GtC in 2100).</p>
<p>Historically, gross CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions have increased at an average rate of about
  1.7% per year since 1900 (Nakicenovic et al., 1996); if that historical trend
  continues global emissions would double during the next three to four decades
  and increase more than sixfold by 2100. Many scenarios in the database describe
  such a development. However, the range is very large around this historical
  trend so that the highest scenarios envisage more than a sevenfold increase
  of global emissions by 2100 as compared with 1990, while the lowest have emissions
  lower than those of today. The median and the average of the scenarios lead
  to about a threefold emissions increase over the same time period or to about
  16 GtC. This is lower than the median of the IS92 set and is lower than the
  IS92a scenario, often considered as the "central" scenario with respect to some
  of its tendencies. However, the distribution of emissions is asymmetric. The
  thin emissions "tail" that extends above the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile (i.e., between
  the six and tenfold increase of emissions by 2100 compared to 1990) includes
  only a few scenarios. The range of other emissions and the main scenario driving
  forces (such as population growth, economic development and energy production,
  conversion and end use) for the scenarios documented in the database is also
  large and comparable to the variation of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions. Statistics associated
  with scenarios from the literature do not imply probability of occurrence or
  likelihood of the scenarios. The frequency distribution of the database may
  be influenced by the use of IS92a as a reference for scenario studies.</p>
