<h4>4.4.2.1. A1 Scenarios</h4>
<p>The A1 marker scenario (Jiang et al., 2000) was created with the AIM model,
  an integrated assessment model developed by NIES, Japan (see <a href="150.htm">Appendix
  IV</a>). The A1 scenario family is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An affluent world, with a rapid demographic transition (declining mortality
    and fertility rates) and an increasing degree of international development
    equity.</li>
  <li>Very high productivity and economic growth in all regions, with a considerable
    catch-up of developing countries.</li>
  <li>Comparatively high energy and materials demands, moderated however by continuous
    structural change and the diffusion of more efficient technologies, consistent
    with the high productivity growth and capital turnover rates of the scenario.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first group of A1 scenarios, which includes the A1B marker, assumes "balanced"<sup><a href="fn5.htm#6" onClick="showFootnote(5,6); return false;">6</a></sup>
  progress across all resources and technologies from energy supply to end use,
  as well as "balanced" land-use changes. Three other groups of A1 scenarios were
  identified which describe three alternative pathways according to different
  resource and technology development assumptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A1C: "clean coal" technologies that are generally environmentally friendly
    with the exception of GHG emissions.</li>
  <li>A1G: an "oil- and gas-rich" future, with a swift transition from conventional
    resources to abundant unconventional resources including methane clathrates.</li>
  <li>A1T: a "non-fossil" future, with rapid development of solar and nuclear
    technologies on the supply side and mini-turbines and fuel cells used in energy
    end-use applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>The divergence between the various scenario groups (in terms of resource availability
  and the direction of technological change) results in a wide range of GHG emissions.
  The two fossil-fuel dominated alternatives, A1C and A1G (combined into the fossil-intensive
  A1FI scenario group in the SPM, see <a href="fn5.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(5,1); return false;">Footnote
  1</a>), have higher, and the A1T alternatives have lower, GHG emissions than
  the A1 marker scenario (see <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<p>"Balanced" A1 scenarios quantifications were also calculated by the models<a href="fn5.htm#7" onClick="showFootnote(5,7); return false;"><sup>7</sup></a>
  A1B-ASF, A1B-IMAGE, A1B-MARIA, A1B-MESSAGE, and A1B-MiniCAM. Additional scenarios
  representing A1 scenario groups were developed using the AIM (A1C-AIM, A1G-AIM,
  A1T-AIM <a href="fn5.htm#8" onClick="showFootnote(5,8); return false;"><sup>8</sup></a>
  ), MARIA (A1T-MARIA), MESSAGE (A1C-MESSAGE, A1G-MESSAGE, A1T-MESSAGE), and MiniCAM
  (A1C-MiniCAM, A1G-MiniCAM) models. The MiniCAM modeling team also evaluated
  alternative interpretations of the A1 scenario storyline with different demographic,
  economic, and energy development patterns (A1v1-MiniCAM and A1v2-MiniCAM) on
  top of the alternative technology-resource developments examined in the other
  A1 scenarios.</p>
<h4>4.4.2.2. A2 Scenarios<a name="4422"></a></h4>
<p>The A2 marker scenario (A2-ASF) was developed using ASF (see <a href="150.htm">Appendix IV</a>),
  an integrated set of modeling tools that was also used to generate the first
  and the second sets of IPCC emission scenarios (SA90 and IS92). Overall, the
  A2-ASF quantification is based on the following assumptions (Sankovski et al.,
  2000):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Relatively slow demographic transition and relatively slow convergence in
    regional fertility patterns.</li>
  <li>Relatively slow convergence in inter-regional GDP per capita differences.</li>
  <li>Relatively slow end-use and supply-side energy efficiency improvements (compared
    to other storylines).</li>
  <li>Delayed development of renewable energy.</li>
  <li>No barriers to the use of nuclear energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional scenario quantifications of A2 were developed using the AIM (A2-AIM)<a href="fn5.htm#9" onClick="showFootnote(5,9); return false;"><sup>9</sup></a>
  , IMAGE (A2-IMAGE)<a href="fn5.htm#10" onClick="showFootnote(5,10); return false;"><sup>10</sup></a>,
  MESSAGE (A2-MESSAGE), and MiniCAM (A2-MiniCAM)<a href="fn5.htm#11" onClick="showFootnote(5,11); return false;"><sup>11</sup></a>
  models. An alternative interpretation of the A2 scenario storyline in the form
  of a "delayed development" or "transitional" scenario between the A2 and A1
  scenario families was developed by the MiniCAM modeling team (A2- A1-MiniCAM).</p>
<h4>4.4.2.3. B1 Scenarios<a name="4423"></a></h4>
<p>The B1 marker scenario (de Vries et al., 2000) was developed using the IMAGE
  2.1 model (see <a href="150.htm">Appendix IV</a>). Earlier versions of
  the model were used in the first IPCC scenario development effort (SA90). B1
  illustrates the possible emissions implications of a scenario in which the world
  chooses consistently and effectively a development path that favors efficiency
  of resource use and "dematerialization" of economic activities. The scenario
  entails in particular:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rapid demographic transition driven by rapid social development, including
    education.</li>
  <li>High economic growth in all regions, with significant catch-up in the presently
    less-developed regions that leads to a substantial reduction in present income
    disparities.</li>
  <li>Comparatively small increase in energy demand because of dematerialization
    of economic activities, saturation of material- and energy-intensive activities
    (e.g., car ownership), and effective innovation and implementation of measures
    to improve energy efficiency.</li>
  <li>Timely and effective development of non-fossil energy supply options in
    response to the desire for a clean local and regional environment and to the
    gradual depletion of conventional oil and gas supplies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional scenarios of B1 were developed using the AIM (B1- AIM), ASF (B1-ASF),
  MARIA (B1-MARIA), MESSAGE (B1- MESSAGE), and MiniCAM (B1-MiniCAM) models. Some
  of these scenarios explore alternative technological developments (akin to the
  A1 scenario, e.g. B1T-MESSAGE) or alternative interpretations on rates and potentials
  of future dematerialization and energy-intensity improvements (e.g., B1High-MESSAGE
  and B1High-MiniCAM explore scenario sensitivities of higher energy demand compared
  to the B1 marker).</p>
<h4>4.4.2.4. B2 Scenarios<a name="4424"></a></h4>
<p>The B2 marker scenario (Riahi and Roehrl, 2000) was developed using the MESSAGE
  model (see <a href="150.htm">Appendix IV</a>), an integrated set of energy-sector simulation and optimization
  models used to generate the IIASA-WEC long-term energy and emission scenarios
  (IIASA-WEC, 1995; Nakicenovic et al., 1998). Compared to the other storylines
  (A1 and B1), the B2 future unfolds with more gradual changes and less extreme
  developments in all respects, including geopolitics, demographics, productivity
  growth, technological dynamics, and other salient scenario characteristics.
  A more fragmented pattern of future development (not that different from present
  trends) precludes any particularly strong convergence tendencies in the scenario
  quantification:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Model parameter values for projections to 2100 were derived typically from
    long-term historical data series where applicable (Marchetti and Nakicenovic,
    1979; Nakicenovic, 1987; Gr�bler, 1990; Nakicenovic et al., 1996; Gr�bler,
    1998a; Nakicenovic et al., 1998), or adopted from the medians of the analysis
    of the scenario literature (see <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a>).</li>
  <li>The scenario quantification assumes effective policies in solving local
    and regional problems such as traffic congestion, local air pollution, and
    acid rain impacts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional B2 scenarios were developed using the AIM (B2- AIM), ASF (B2-ASF)<a href="fn5.htm#12" onClick="showFootnote(5,12); return false;"><sup>12</sup></a>
  , IMAGE (B2-IMAGE)<a href="fn5.htm#10" onClick="showFootnote(5,10); return false;"><sup>10</sup></a>,
  MARIA (B2- MARIA; Mori, 2000), and MiniCAM (B2-MiniCAM)<a href="fn5.htm#13" onClick="showFootnote(5,13); return false;"><sup>13</sup></a>
  models. Again, more than one B2 scenario interpretation was generated. Some
  models (e.g., B2-MARIA or B2High-MiniCAM) offered additional perspectives of
  both inter- and intra-model variability in the interpretation of the B2 storyline,
  particularly with respect to resource availability and technology development
  assumptions (see<a href="105.htm"> Section 4.4.7</a>) and their resultant impact
  on GHG emissions (see <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>).</p>

<p><a href="#fig44">Figure 4-4</a> summarizes the main global scenario indicators
  of the four SRES marker scenarios by 2100, including population and global GDP
  levels, final energy intensities, final energy use, corresponding carbon intensities,
  land-use changes<a href="fn5.htm#14" onClick="showFootnote(5,14); return false;"><sup>14</sup></a>,
  and energy-related CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions. It illustrates that the range of the most
  important scenario characteristics spanned by the four SRES marker scenarios
  and the entire SRES scenario set covers the uncertainty range well, as reflected
  in the scenario literature. The scenario space defined by the lines "SRES-max"
  and "SRES-min" lies well within the range spanned by the scenario literature
  contained in the SRES scenario database and analyzed in <a href="034.htm">Chapter
  2</a>. The two exceptions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The low range of future CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from the literature is not reflected
    in the SRES scenarios, consistent with the SRES Terms of Reference to consider
    only scenarios that assume no "additional climate policy initiatives" (see
    <a href="146.htm">Appendix I</a>).</li>
  <li>The low end of the range of global GDP and energy use from the literature
    is equally not reflected in the SRES scenarios. Very low global GDP values
    arise from a combination of rapid demographic transition with low per capita
    productivity growth, a combination for which there is little theoretic or
    empiric support in the available literature on demographic and economic growth
    reviewed in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>. Low GDP scenarios can also reflect a combination of
    average population growth and low economic growth; this type of future usually
    depicts low-income, inequitable, and possibly unstable worlds that are not
    analyzed in this report (see <a href="091.htm#box42">Box 4-2</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Equally, while the SRES scenarios cover the range from the literature, the
  four marker scenarios cannot and do not replicate the frequency distributions
  of individual scenario variables as discussed in <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a>. Nor can their quantitative
  characteristics segment the relevant distributions in approximately equal intervals.
  Two distinguishing features characterize the SRES scenarios. First, probabilities
  or likelihood are not assigned to any quantitative scenario characteristics
  (inputs or outputs). Thus, that two of the SRES marker scenarios deploy the
  same (low) demographic projection does not imply that such a scenario is considered
  more likely. It only indicates that such a demographic scenario was judged by
  the SRES writing team to be consistent with two of the four SRES storylines,
  as opposed to arbitrarily assigning different population projections to other
  "high" or "low" scenario characteristics. Second, the SRES scenarios incorporate
  current understanding of important interrelations between various scenario-driving
  forces (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Thus, a "free," or "modeler's choice," numeric combination
  of scenario indicators is simply not possible. For instance, intermediary levels
  of global GDP or energy use could result both from a medium population projection
  combined with intermediate per capita GDP or energy use growth, or alternatively
  from low or high population projections combined with high or low GDP and energy
  per capita values, respectively. The fact that for some quantitative scenario
  characteristics a number of SRES marker scenarios cluster more toward the upper
  or lower range spanned by the scenario literature merely indicates the existence
  of important relationships between scenario characteristics. It also indicates
  that a limited number of scenarios (four markers) cannot replicate the distribution
  of individual scenario values arising out of an analysis of more than 400 scenarios
  published in the literature<a href="fn5.htm#15" onClick="showFootnote(5,15); return false;"><sup>15</sup></a>.
  Hence, it is important to consider always the entire range across all 40 SRES
  scenarios when analyzing uncertainties in all driving-force variables and the
  resultant emission categories.</p>
