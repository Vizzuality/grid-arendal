<p>The 1994 IPCC evaluation of the usefulness of the IPCC 1992 (IS92) scenarios
  found that for the purposes of driving atmospheric and climate models, the CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>
  emissions trajectories in these provided a reasonable reflection of variations
  found in the open literature. Specifically, their global CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions spanned
  most of the range of other scenarios identified in the literature. <a href="#fig12">Figure
  1-2</a> shows the global, energy-related and industrial CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions of the
  IS92 scenarios ranging from very high emissions of 35.8 GtC to very low emissions
  of 4.6 GtC by 2100 (corresponding to a sixfold increase and a decline by a third
  compared to 1990 levels, respectively). The shaded area in <a href="#fig12">Figure
  1-2</a> indicates the coverage of the IS92 scenarios while the "spaghetti-like"
  curves indicate other energy-related emissions scenarios found by the IPCC review
  to be representative of the scenarios available in the open literature at that
  time (Alcamo et al., 1995). In the open literature, emissions trajectories for
  other gases were extremely thin in many instances, but the IS92 cases were not
  dissimilar to these.</p>
<p>Another important recommendation of the 1994 IPCC review was that, given the
  degree of uncertainty about future climate change, analysts should use the full
  range of IS92 emissions as input to climate models rather than a single scenario.
  This is in stark contrast to the actual use of one particular scenario in the
  set, the IS92a scenario, as the reference case in numerous studies. In fact,
  the IS92a scenario is often referred to in climate change modeling and impact
  studies as the "business-as- usual" scenario and used as the only reference
  emissions trajectory. The review concluded that the mere fact of the IS92a being
  an intermediate, or central, CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions scenario at the global level does
  not equate it with being the most likely scenario. Indeed, the conclusion was
  that there was no objective basis on which to assign likelihood to any of the
  scenarios. Furthermore, the IS92a scenario was shown to be "central" for only
  a few of its salient characteristics such as global population growth, global
  economic development and global CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions. In other ways, IS92a was found
  not to be central with respect to the published literature, particularly in
  some of its regional input assumptions. The same is the case with the new set
  of SRES scenarios, as is shown below. No single scenario can be central with
  respect to all the characteristics relevant for different uses of emissions
  scenarios and there is no objective way to assign likelihood to any of the scenarios.</p>
<h1><a name="anc1"></a>1.5. Why New IPCC Emissions Scenarios?</h1>
<p>The 1994 IPCC evaluation of the IS92 scenarios found that the scenarios were
  innovative at the time of their publication and path-breaking in their coverage
  of the full range of GHG and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions, on both a global and a regional
  basis. The review also identified a number of weaknesses. These included the
  limited range of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> intensities of energy (CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions per unit energy)
  reflected in the six scenarios and the absence of any scenario with significant
  closure in the income gap between developed and developing countries, even after
  a full century (Parikh, 1992). Across all six scenarios the per capita income
  in the developing countries grows only to a share of 17% to 26% of that of the
  industrial countries, compared to 6% today.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the development of the IS92 scenarios much has changed in
  our understanding of both the possible future GHG emissions and the climate
  impacts that might result. The most straightforward change arises because the
  IS92 scenarios had to estimate data for the base year 1990 (actual data were
  unavailable at the time); 1990 is no longer a forecast year and actual data
  can be used. But other changes are at least as important. It is now recognized
  that in some regions SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions may be as important to climate change as
  all non-CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> greenhouse related gases combined - at least in the near-term. As
  a result the rapid growth of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in the IS92 scenarios has been questioned.
  The 1994 evaluation of the IS92 scenario series (Alcamo et al., 1995) concluded,
  for instance, that projected emissions in the Organization for Economic Cooperation
  and Development (OECD) countries did not reflect recent legislative changes
  such as the Amendments of the Clean Air Act in the US or the Second European
  Sulfur Protocol. Thus, factors other than climate change, namely regional and
  local air quality, may well prompt limits on future SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions independent
  of global warming concerns. Restructuring in Eastern and Central Europe and
  the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union has powerfully affected
  economic activity, with reductions in CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions unforeseen in the IS92 scenarios.
  The advent of integrated assessment (IA) models has also made it possible now
  to construct internally consistent emissions scenarios that jointly consider
  the interactions among energy use, the economy, and land-use change. Some IA
  models account for interactions in both directions between driving forces of
  GHG and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions and possible impacts of climate change. Progress has also
  been made in achieving greater consistency among scenario characteristics such
  as the rates of technological change in different sectors.</p>
<p>Owing to these advances, the 1994 IPCC review of the IS92 scenarios concluded
  that new scenarios, if developed, should include these improvements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>estimation of emissions baselines and future non-CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions, particularly
    from land use;</li>
  <li>incorporation of the latest information on economic restructuring throughout
    the world;</li>
  <li>expand the range of economic-development pathways, including a narrowing
    of the income gap between developing and industrialized countries;</li>
  <li>examine different trends in and rates of technological change;</li>
  <li>evaluate possible consequences of trade and market liberalization and privatization;
    and</li>
  <li>reflect current emission commitments in connection with the United Nations
    Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1997).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the Terms of Reference for SRES explicitly preclude additional initiatives,
  measures and policies specifically designed to reduce climate change (see <a href="146.htm">Appendix
  I</a>).</p>
