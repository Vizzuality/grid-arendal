<h3><a name="anc1"></a>2.4.1. Carbon Dioxide Emissions Ranges</h3>
<p>The span of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions across all scenarios in the database is indeed large,
  with a range from more than seven times the current emissions levels to below
  current levels in 2100 (see Figures <a href="#fig21a">2-1a</a> and <a href="#fig21b">2-1b</a>).
  The possible interpretations of this large range are many. The most important
  is the great uncertainty as to how the main driving forces, such as population
  growth, economic development, and energy production, conversion and end use,
  might unfold during the 21st century. A large majority of the scenarios in the
  database report only energy-related CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions (230 of the 256 that report
  CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions), while only some report non-energy CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> and other GHG emissions.
  Therefore, these comparisons of emissions scenarios focus mostly on energy-related
  emissions. <a href="#box21">Box 2-1</a> summarizes the set of 26 scenarios that
  report land-use CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions.</p>

      <p><br>
	About 23% of the current total anthropogenic CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions arise from
	land-use change (Pepper <i>et al</i>., 1992), which makes it an important
	driving force. Direct comparison of absolute levels of land-use CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions
	between scenarios in the database is difficult because of variations in
	how models depict deforestation and in how modelers classify anthropogenic
	and natural land-use fluxes. In addition, models are based on different
	base-year data, which further complicates comparison. For example, the
	1990 base-year emissions estimates from land-use change (e.g., deforestation)
	range from 0.6 to 1.4 gigatons of elemental carbon (GtC). However, by
	indexing emissions to 1990, it is possible to make more meaningful comparisons
	of trends among the 26 scenarios in the SRES database that report land-use
	CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions. It is important to note that only three modeling groups
	produced the 26 scenarios described here. Clearly, emissions from land-use
	change have not been as well explored by the modeling community as energy-related
	emissions.</p>
      <p>All 26 scenarios show a decrease in CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from land-use change
	over time and are below current levels by 2100; some models even report
	emissions reductions below zero, which suggests CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> sequestration (e.g.,
	through afforestation). The emissions range is very wide during the next
	few decades, but narrows considerably around mid-century. For example,
	there is more than a factor ten difference (after normalizing for base-year
	differences) between the highest and lowest scenarios in 2020. (For reference,
	the IS92a scenario falls slightly below the median of the range.) By 2050,
	however, the gap between the extremes narrows, and by 2100 the range is
	very small indeed: the highest scenario shows CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from land
	use only 2.4 times as great as those found in the lowest scenario. All
	26 scenarios in the database report CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions of less than 1 GtC originating
	from land-use change in 2100, and 23% of the scenarios indicate CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> sequestration
	by the end of the 21st century.</p>

<p><a href="#fig21a">Figure 2-1a</a> shows the global energy-related and industrial
  CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions pathways from the database in the form of spaghetti curves for
  the period 1990 to 2100 against the background of historical emissions from
  1900 to 1990. These curves are plotted against an index on the vertical axis
  rather than as absolute values, because of large differences and discrepancies
  for the values assumed for the base year 1990 in various scenarios. The discrepancies
  may result from genuine differences among the scenarios (e.g., different base
  years, data sources, and definitions <sup><small><a href="fn3.htm#4" onClick="showFootnote(3,4); return false;">4</a></small></sup>
  ) or from simple errors in calibration.
<p><a href="#fig21b">Figure 2-1b</a> gives absolute values of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions
  from various scenarios in the database. It shows the magnitude of differences
  between the scenarios in the base year 1990 and gives the resultant range of
  emissions in 2100 directly in GtC.<sup><small><a href="fn3.htm#6" onClick="showFootnote(3,6); return false;">6</a></small></sup>
  Between 1900 and 1990, global CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions have increased at an average rate
  of about 1.7% per year (Nakic´enovic´ <i>et al</i>., 1998b). Global emissions
  would double during the next three to four decades if this historical trend
  were to continue. Many scenarios in the database describe such a development.
  However, even by 2030 the range is very large around this value of possible
  doubling of global emissions. The highest scenarios have emissions four times
  the 1990 level by 2030, while the lowest are barely above half that level. The
  divergence increases with time so that the highest scenarios envisage a tenfold
  increase of global emissions by 2100. The lowest scenarios continue to decrease
  and some of them are consistent with emissions trajectories that lead to an
  eventual stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations.</p>
<p><a href="039.htm#fig21a">Figure 2-1a</a> indicates a large range between the
  highest and the lowest scenarios. Some of the scenarios on both extremes can
  be characterized as clear outliers in the far tails of the scenario distribution.
  Often, such scenarios are normative in nature, having been formulated for a
  particular purpose. However, even if these extreme tails are discarded the range
  is very wide. The 95th percentile corresponds to a sixfold increase (about 37
  GtC) by 2100, while the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile leads to a decrease to about a third
  (2 GtC) compared to the 1990 level. This range of 2-37 GtC in 2100 indicates
  the high degree of uncertainty with respect to the level of future GHG emissions.
  The emissions range is somewhat smaller, from 6.5 to 22 GtC, for the 25<sup>th</sup> and
  75<sup>th</sup> percentiles, respectively. However, the statistics associated with scenarios
  from the literature do not imply probability of their occurrence.<br>
