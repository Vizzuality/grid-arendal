<h1>2.1. Introduction</h1>
<p>Presented in this chapter is the assessment of more than 400 global and regional
  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios based on an extensive literature review.
  Emissions scenarios provide an important input for the assessment of future
  climate change. Future anthropogenic GHG emissions depend on numerous driving
  forces, including population growth, economic development, energy supply and
  use, land-use patterns, and a host of other human activities. These main driving
  forces that determine the emissions trajectories in the scenarios often also
  provide input to assess possible emissions mitigation strategies and possible
  impacts of unabated emissions. In view of the many different uses, it is not
  surprising that numerous emissions scenarios are presented in the literature
  and that the number of regional and global emissions scenarios is growing.</p>
<p>An important characteristic of the scenarios in this Special Report on Emissions
  Scenarios (SRES) is that they reflect the underlying uncertainty, part of which
  derives from the range of emissions in the literature. The objective was to
  encompass the variation within the most important scenario driving forces and
  emissions, the complexity of possible relationships between driving forces and
  emissions, and the associated uncertainties that characterize alternative future
  developments. The SRES scenarios cover most of the range of the GHG emissions
  scenarios found in the literature, including the International Panel on Climate
  Change (IPCC) 1992 Scenarios (IS92) series (Leggett <i>et al</i>., 1992). The
  writing team considered the literature in creating a new set of scenarios. Importantly,
  however, the literature on existing scenarios provides only a general framework
  to aid analysis; it is informative, but not determinative.</p>
<p>The literature review consists of four parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>documentation of as many as possible of the quantitative global and regional
    emissions scenarios available both in the open literature and from international
    activities that involve documentation of submitted scenarios;</li>
  <li>development of a scenario database to document the more than 400 emissions
    scenarios collected during the literature review;</li>
  <li>evaluation of the ranges and relationships of the main scenario driving
    forces and the resultant emissions for the scenarios documented in the database;
    and</li>
  <li>assessment of the scenario submissions received through the SRES "open process."</li>
</ul>
<p>Central to this assessment of emissions scenarios and their main driving forces
  is a unique scenario database developed by the National Institute for Environmental
  Studies (NIES) in Japan for SRES (Morita and Lee, 1998). The database version
  of 3. April 1998, which is assessed in this chapter, includes 416 different
  scenarios. The current database version can be accessed through an ftp-site
  (<a target="_top" href="http://www-cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/db/ipcc.html">www-cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/db/ipcc.html</a>).
  It is the most comprehensive collection of emissions scenarios in the publicly
  available literature. It includes most of the recent global and regional scenarios
  and all of the scenarios used in the latest IPCC evaluation of emissions scenarios
  (Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1995). Therefore, the emissions scenarios documented
  in the database are representative of the literature in general. However, there
  are a number of ways in which the coverage of the scenarios in the database
  could be extended in the future. For example, inclusion of long-term emissions
  scenarios for individual countries, when available, would improve the regional
  coverage (e.g., Parikh, 1996; Murthy <i>et al</i>., 1997). Also, a large majority
  of the scenarios report only energy-related carbon dioxide (CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> ) emissions (230
  scenarios), while only some report non-energy CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> and other GHG emissions. This
  shortcoming of the emissions scenarios in the literature was identified in the
  last IPCC evaluation (Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1995).</p>
<p>The scenarios in the database were collected from 171 different literature
  sources and other scenario-evaluation activities, such as the Energy Modeling
  Forum (EMF; see Weyant, 1993) and the International Energy Workshop (IEW; see
  Manne and Schrattenholzer, 1996, 1997). The scenarios span a wide range of assumptions
  about demographic trends, levels of economic development, energy consumption
  and efficiency patterns, and other factors. The aim of this chapter is to show
  how the database can be utilized for the analysis of GHG emissions ranges and
  their main driving forces. Part of this assessment of the emissions scenarios
  is based on an earlier publication on the analysis of scenarios documented in
  the SRES database (Nakic´enovic´ <i>et al</i>., 1998a).</p>
<p>The scenarios in the database display a large range of future GHG emissions.
  Part of the range can be attributed to the different methods and models used
  to formulate the scenarios, which include simple spreadsheet models, economic
  models, and systems-engineering models. However, most of the range results from
  differences in the input assumptions of the scenarios, in particular those of
  the main scenario driving forces. In addition, simply to compare alternative
  emissions levels across different scenarios is not sufficient to shed light
  on internal consistency, plausibility, and comparability of the assumptions
  behind the scenarios. Analysis of the underlying driving forces is thus also
  an important part of the evaluation. This chapter provides an analysis of the
  main driving forces, such as population growth, economic growth, energy consumption,
  and energy and carbon intensities. Some of these driving forces are specified
  as model inputs, and some are derived from model outputs, so it is necessary
  to determine the assumed relationships among the main driving forces.</p>
<p>Although the scenario database is well suited for the documentation of quantitative
  scenarios, there is also a significant literature on narrative scenarios. Both
  scenario types have in common that they are generally carefully constructed
  descriptions of possible future developments within the bounds of explicit assumptions
  and circumstances (see <a href="023.htm">Chapter 1</a> for a more detailed discussion about scenarios).
  The difference is that the quantitative scenarios are usually developed with
  the help of formal models so as to assign internally consistent values to the
  various scenario characteristics.</p>
<p>The SRES scenarios employ both approaches - a storyline that gives a broad,
  narrative, and qualitative scenario description plus a number of quantifications
  of each storyline with six different models. Thus, even though both narrative
  stories and quantitative scenarios are an integral part of the SRES emissions
  scenarios, the literature review focused on the documentation and the assessment
  of quantitative scenarios, for two reasons. First, it was not possible to devise
  a classification system that would allow the documentation of many different
  forms of narrative scenarios. Second, the SRES objective was to develop a set
  of numeric emissions scenarios for use in the IPCC and other assessments of
  climate change. Therefore, in this chapter the focus is only on the literature
  review of quantitative scenarios. A more detailed discussion of narrative scenarios
  is given in <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a>; it deals with the four SRES storylines
  and how they are related to recent work in the area of qualitative scenarios.</p>
<p>The literature on quantitative scenarios is large indeed. This assessment is
  focused on the scenarios that extend at least to 2020, but about 10 scenarios
  with a shorter time horizon of 2010 are also included in the database. In addition,
  most of the scenarios have a global coverage, although a few regional scenarios
  are included to enhance the coverage of some parts of the world. These criteria
  narrowed considerably the number of global and regional GHG emissions scenarios
  with sufficient information to be included in the scenario literature review.</p>
<p>This scenario literature review and evaluation is the second undertaken by
  the IPCC. The first was conducted to evaluate the IS92 set of scenarios in comparison
  to other GHG emissions scenarios found in the literature (Alcamo <i>et al</i>.,
  1995)<sup><small><a href="fn3.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(3,1); return false;">1</a></small></sup> . It was completed in 1994 and included a comprehensive evaluation of
  GHG emissions and their main driving forces. This second review and evaluation
  builds upon and extends the earlier IPCC assessment. Consequently, an effort
  was made in the present review to include especially the GHG emissions scenarios
  published since the presentation of the IS92 scenarios.</p>
