<h3>3.3.2. Historical Trends<a name="anc1"></a></h3>
<p>Rostow (1990) described several stages in the economic development process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, the pre-industrial economy, in which most resources must be devoted
    to agriculture because of the low level of productivity.</li>
  <li>Second, the phase of capacity-building that leads to an economic acceleration.</li>
  <li>Third, the acceleration itself, which requires about two decades.</li>
  <li>Fourth, about six decades of industrialization and catch-up to the "productivity
    frontiers" prevailing in the industrialized countries.</li>
  <li>Fifth, the period of mass-consumerism and the welfare state.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important not to conceptualize economic development as a quasi-autonomous,
  linear development path. Numerous socio-institutional preconditions have to
  be met before any "take off" into accelerated rates of productivity and economic
  growth can materialize (<a href="060.htm">see Section 3.3.4</a>). "Leading sectors"
  (Fogel, 1970) that drive productivity and output growth change over time (Freeman
  and Perez, 1988; Freeman, 1990), and different "industrialization paths" (Chenery
  <i>et al</i>., 1986) have been identified in historical analyses. Still, historical
  evidence, consistent with neoclassic growth theory, allows a number of generalizations
  as to the patterns of advances in productivity and economic growth.</p>
<p>By and large, growth rates are lower for economies at the technology and productivity
  frontier, compared to those approaching it. For instance, in the 19th century
  productivity and per capita GDP growth in the rapidly industrializing US far
  exceeded those of England, then at the technology and productivity frontier.
  Likewise, in the post-World War II period growth rates in Japan and most of
  Western Europe exceeded those of the US (by then at the technology and productivity
  frontier) (Maddison, 1991, 1995). High human capital (education), a favorable
  institutional environment, free trade, and access to technology are acknowledged
  as key factors for rapid economic catch-up (<a href="060.htm">see Section 3.3.4</a>).
  Likewise, entrenchment in progressively outdated capital and technology vintages
  acts as a retarding force against growth (Frankel, 1955), and rapid capital
  turnover and possibilities to "leapfrog" (Goldemberg, 1991) outdated technologies
  and infrastructures provide the potential for faster economic catch-up.</p>

  Perhaps the most comprehensive compilation of data on historical economic development
  is that of Maddison (1995). <a href="#tbl32">Table 3-2</a> shows Maddison's
  per capita GDP growth rate estimates for selected regions and time periods.
  Since 1820 global GDP has increased by a factor of 40, or at a rate of about
  2.2% per year. Per capita GDP growth was 1.2% per year faster than population
  growth. In the past 110 years (a time frame comparable to that addressed in
  this report) global GDP increased by a factor of 20, or at a rate of 2.7% per
  year, and global per capita GDP grew by a factor of more than five, or at a
  rate of 1.5% per year. There is substantial variation in the rates of economic
  growth over time and across countries. Even for the present OECD countries modern
  economic growth dates only from approximately 1870 onward, and for developing
  economies comparable conditions for economic growth and catch-up in productivity
  levels existed only in the second half of the 20th century. These approximate
  dates also set the time frame for drawing useful comparisons between historical
  experiences and future projections (<a href="059.htm#anc1">see Section 3.3.3</a>).</p>
<p>Historically, economic growth has been concentrated in Europe, the Americas,
  and Australasia. Sustained high-productivity growth (per capita GDP growth)
  resulted in the current high levels of per capita income in the OECD countries.
  Latecomers (such as Austria, Japan, Scandinavia) rapidly caught up to the productivity
  frontier of the other OECD economies (most notably that of the US) in the post-World
  War II period. Per capita GDP growth rates of 3.5% per annum were, for instance,
  achieved in Western Europe between 1950 and 1980. Similarly, high per capita
  GDP growth rates were achieved in the developing economies of Asia. Per capita
  GDP growth rates of individual countries have even been higher - 8% per annum
  in Japan over the period 1950-1973, 7% in Korea between 1965 and 1992, and 6.5%
  per year in China since 1980 (Maddison, 1995). Progress in increasing per capita
  income levels has been significant in many regions and countries over the long
  term, although income gaps in both absolute and relative terms have not been
  reduced in the aggregate. For instance, per capita GDP in Africa is estimated
  to have been about 20% of the level of the most affluent OECD region in 1870;
  by 1990 this ratio had decreased to 6% (Maddison, 1995).</p>
<p>Other key indicators of human development have also improved strongly in recent
  decades. For instance, since 1960 (in little more than a generation) infant
  mortality rates in developing countries have more than halved, malnutrition
  rates have declined by one-third, primary school attendance rates have increased
  from about half to three-quarters, and the share of rural families with access
  to safe drinking water has increased from 25% to 65% for low-income families
  and to more than 95% for high-income families (UNDP, 1997; World Bank, 1999).</p>
<p>Equally noticeable in <a href="#tbl32">Table 3-2</a> is the slowdown of per
  capita GDP growth in the OECD countries since the end of the 1970s and the serious
  setbacks in Eastern Europe and developing countries outside Asia over the same
  time period. After a decade of decline in economic output, a trend reversal
  to positive growth rates is expected to occur only after the year 2000 (World
  Bank, 1998b). Even optimistic scenarios indicate that the pre-crises (1989)
  levels of per capita income cannot be achieved again until 2010 (Nakicenovic
  <i>et al</i>., 1998a).</p>
<p>The effects of the recent Asian financial crises are estimated to reduce significantly
  short-term economic growth in the region, but longer-term growth prospects remain
  solid. After a sluggish growth to the year 2000, economic growth in the developing
  countries of Asia is anticipated to resume at 6.6% per year for the period 2001-2007
  (World Bank, 1998b).

<p>The past two centuries have seen major structural shifts, with inter-related
  changes in demography, economic structure, and technology. The world's largest
  economies have seen a continuous shift in economic structure, from agricultural
  production to industry and, to a greater extent, services (see<a href="#fig39">
  Figure 3-9</a>). During the past half-century, the industry share declined to
  leave these economies dominated by service sectors. A similar pattern has occurred
  in most other economies in Europe, North America, and Australasia. Another major
  feature of the past two centuries, not shown in <a href="#fig39">Figure 3-9</a>,
  is the growing role of government in the economy. The literature on structural
  change is reviewed in more detail in Jung et al. (2000).</p>
<p>Differences in statistical definitions make it difficult to compare structural
  change in the former centrally planned economies with that in mature market
  economies. Also, in the less-developed regions a marked decline in the contribution
  of agriculture to GDP has occurred in recent years, but the contribution of
  services is larger than it was historically in industrial countries at the same
  level of income. This indicates the dangers of using past history too literally
  as a guide to future behavior.</p>
<p>These economic developments have accompanied the processes of urbanization,
  increased access to education, improved health care, and longer life expectancies.
  They have been linked to increasing complexity in economic, legal, and social
  institutions (Tainter, 1996). The pattern seen in the six countries shown in
  <a href="#fig39">Figure 3-9</a> is reproduced in most parts of the world. In
  general, increasing income per capita is associated with a shift in production
  patterns, first from agriculture to industry, and then more gradually away from
  industry into services. Succession processes beneath these macro-level changes
  are important. Industrial sectors and technologies have risen and fallen in
  importance over the past few centuries. These processes and analysts' various
  attempts to find patterns to describe them are further discussed in <a href="060.htm">Section
  3.3.4</a>.</p>
