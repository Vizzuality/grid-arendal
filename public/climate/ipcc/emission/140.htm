<h4>6.3.2.2. Nitrous Oxide Emissions<a name="anc1"></a></h4>
<p>Even more than for CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> , the assumed future food supply will be a key determinant
  of future N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions. Size, age structure, and regional spread of the global
  population will be reflected in the emissions trajectories, together with assumptions
  on diets and improvements in agricultural practices. Again, as for CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> in the
  SRES scenarios (see <a href="120.htm">Section 5.4.1</a> in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>), continued
  growth of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions emerges only in the A2 scenario, largely because of
  high population growth. In the other three marker scenarios, emissions peak
  and then decline sooner or later in the course of the 21 st century. Importantly,
  as the largest anthropogenic source of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O (cultivated soils) is already very
  uncertain in the base year, all future emissions trajectories are affected by
  large uncertainties, especially if calculated with different models, as is the
  case in this SRES report. Therefore, the writing team recommends further research
  into the sources and modeling of long-term N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions. Uncertainty ranges
  are correspondingly large, and are sometimes asymmetric. For example, while
  the range in 2100 reported in all A1 scenarios is between 5 and 10 MtN (7 MtN
  in the A1B marker), the A2 marker reports 17 MtN in 2100. Other A2 scenarios
  report emissions that fall within the range reported for A1 (from 8 to 19 MtN
  in 2100). Thus, different model representations of processes that lead to N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O
  emissions and uncertainties in source strength can outweigh easily any underlying
  differences between individual scenarios in terms of population growth, economic
  development, etc. Different assumptions with respect to future crop productivity,
  agricultural practices, and associated emission factors, especially in the very
  populous regions of the world, explain the very different global emission levels
  even for otherwise shared main scenario drivers. Hence, the SRES scenarios extend
  the uncertainty range of future emissions significantly toward higher emissions
  (4.8 to 20.2 MtN by 2100 in SRES compared to 5.4 to 10.8 MtN in the IS92 scenarios.
  (Note that natural sources are excluded in this comparison.) </p>
<h4>6.3.2.3. Halocarbons and Halogenated Compounds<a name="anc2"></a></h4>
<p>The emissions of halocarbons (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons
  (HCFCs), halons, methylbromide, and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)) and other halogenated
  compounds (polyfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>)) across the
  SRES scenarios are described in detail on a substance-by-substance basis in
  <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a> and Fenhann (2000). However, none of the six
  SRES models has its own projections for emissions of ozone depleting substances
  (ODSs), their detailed driving forces, and their substitutes. Hence, a different
  approach for scenario generation was adopted.</p>
<p>First, for ODSs, an external scenario, the Montreal Protocol scenario (A3,
  maximum allowed production) from WMO/UNEP (1998) is used as direct input to
  SRES. In this scenario corresponding emissions decline to zero by 2100 as a
  result of international environmental agreements, a development not yet anticipated
  in some of the IS92 scenarios (Pepper <i>et al</i>., 1992). For the other gas
  species, most notably for CFC and HCFC substitutes, a simple methodology of
  developing different emissions trajectories consistent with the aggregate SRES
  scenario driving force assumptions (population, GDP, etc.) was developed. Scenarios
  are equally further differentiated as to assumed future technological change
  and control rates for these gases, varied across the scenarios consistently
  within the interpretation of the SRES storylines presented in <a href="089.htm">Chapter
  4</a>. The literature, as well as the scenario methodology and data, are documented
  in more detail in Fenhann (2000) and are summarized in <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a>.</p>
<p>Second, different assumptions about CFC applications as well as substitute
  candidates were developed. These were initially based on Kroeze and Reijnders
  (1992) and information given in Midgley and McCulloch (1999), but updated with
  the most recent information from the Joint IPCC/TEAP Expert Meeting on Options
  for the Limitation of Emissions of HFCs and PFCs (WMO/UNEP, 1999) as described
  below. An important assumption, on the basis of the latest information from
  the industry, is that relatively few Montreal gases will be replaced fully by
  HFCs. Current indications are that substitution rates of CFCs by HFCs will be
  less than 50% (McCulloch and Midgley, 1998). In Fenhann (2000) a further technological
  development is assumed that would result in about 25% of the CFCs ultimately
  being substituted by HFCs (see <a href="123.htm#tbl59">Table 5-9</a> in <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a>). This low percentage not only reflects the introduction of non-HFC substitutes,
  but also the notion that smaller amounts of halocarbons will be used in many
  applications when changing to HFCs (efficiency gains with technological change).
  A general assumption is that the present trend, not to substitute with high
  GWP substances (including PFCs and SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>), will continue. As a result of this
  assumption, the emissions reported here may be underestimates. This substitution
  approach is used in all four scenarios, and the technological options adopted
  are those known at present. Further substitution away from HFCs is assumed to
  require a climate policy and is therefore not considered in SRES scenarios.
  Policy measures that may indirectly induce lower halocarbon emissions in the
  scenarios are adopted for reasons other than climate change. For one scenario
  (A2) no reductions were assumed, whereas in the other scenarios intermediary
  reduction rates and levels were assumed. Expressed in HFC-134a equivalents (based
  on SAR equivalents), HFCs in the SRES scenarios range between 843 and 2123 kt
  HFC-134a equivalent by 2100, compared to 1188 to 2375 kt HFC-134a equivalent
  in IS92. The range of emissions of HFCs in the SRES scenario is initially generally
  lower than in earlier IPCC scenarios because of new insights about the availability
  of alternatives to HFCs as replacements for substances controlled by the Montreal
  Protocol. In two of the four scenarios in the report, HFC emissions increase
  rapidly in the second half of the 21st century, while in two others the growth
  of emissions is significantly slowed down or reversed in that period.</p>
<p>Aggregating all the different halocarbons (CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs) as well as halogenated
  compounds (PFCs and SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>) into MtC-equivalents (using SAR GWPs) indicates a range
  between 386 and 1096 MtC-equivalent by 2100 for the SRES scenarios. This compares
  (see Table 6-2b) with a range of 746 to 875 MtC-equivalent for IS92 (which,
  however, does not include PFCs and SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>). (The comparable SRES range, excluding
  PFCs and SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>, is between 299 and 753 MtC-equivalent by 2100.) The scenarios
  presented here indicate a wider range of uncertainty compared to IS92, particularly
  toward lower emissions (because of the technological and substitution reasons
  discussed above).</p>
<p>The effect on climate of each of the substances aggregated to MtC-equivalents
  given in <a href="143.htm#tbl62b">Table 6-2b</a> varies greatly, because of
  differences in both atmospheric lifetime and the radiative effect per molecule
  of each gas. The net effect on climate of these substances is best determined
  by a calculation of their radiative forcing - which is the amount by which these
  gases enhance the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. The net radiative effect
  of all halocarbons, PFCs, and SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> from 1990 to 2100, including a current estimate
  of the radiative effect of stratospheric ozone depletion and subsequent recovery,
  ranges from 6% to 9% of the total radiative forcing from all GHGs and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> .
  Preliminary calculations indicate that the net radiative effect of PFCs and
  SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> in SRES scenarios will be no greater, relative to total anthropogenic forcing,
  by 2100 than it is at present.</p>
<h3><a name="anc3"></a>6.3.3. Sulfur Dioxide Emissions</h3>
<p>Emissions of sulfur portray even more dynamic patterns in time and space than
  the CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions shown in Figures <a href="137.htm#fig65">6-5</a>
  and <a href="137.htm#fig66">6-6</a>. Factors other than climate change (namely
  regional and local air quality, and transformations in the structure of the
  energy system and end use) intervene to limit future emissions. <a href="#fig610">Figure
  6-10</a> shows the range of global sulfur emissions for all SRES scenarios and
  the four markers against the emissions range of the IS92 scenarios, more than
  80 scenarios from the literature, and the historical development. </p>

<p><a name="fig610"></a>A detailed review of long-term global and regional sulfur emission scenarios
  is given in Grübler (1998) and summarized in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>.
  The most important new finding from the scenario literature is recognition of
  the significant adverse impacts of sulfur emissions on human health, food production,
  and ecosystems. As a result, scenarios published since 1995 generally assume
  various degrees of sulfur controls to be implemented in the future, and thus
  have projections substantially lower than previous ones, including the IS92
  scenario series. Of these, only the two low-demand scenarios IS92c and IS92d
  fall within the range of more recent long-term sulfur emission scenarios. A
  related reason for lower sulfur emission projections is the recent tightening
  of sulfur-control policies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
  Development (OECD) countries, such as the Amendments of the Clean Air Act in
  the USA and the implementation of the Second European Sulfur Protocol. Such
  legislative changes were not reflected in previous long-term emission scenarios,
  as noted in Alcamo <i>et al</i>. (1995) and Houghton <i>et al</i>. (1995). Similar
  sulfur control initiatives due to local air quality concerns are beginning to
  impact sulfur emissions also in a number of developing countries in Asia and
  Latin America (see IEA, 1999; La Rovere and Americano, 1998; Streets and Waldhoff,
  2000; for a more detailed discussion see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>). As
  a result, the median from recent sulfur scenarios (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter
  3</a>) is consequently significantly lower compared to IS92, indicating a continual
  decline in global sulfur emissions in the long-term. The median and mean of
  sulfur control scenarios are almost identical. As mentioned above, even the
  highest range of recent sulfur-control scenarios is significantly below that
  of comparable, high-demand IS92 scenarios (IS92a, IS92b, IS92e, and IS92f).
  The scenarios with the lowest ranges project stringent sulfur-control levels
  that lead to a substantial decline in long-term emissions and a return to emission
  levels that prevailed at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Reflecting recent developments and the literature (reviewed in <a href="049.htm">Chapter
  3</a>), it is assumed that sulfur emissions in the SRES scenarios will also
  be controlled increasingly outside the OECD. As a result, both long-term trends
  and regional patterns of sulfur emissions evolve differently from carbon emissions
  in the SRES scenarios. As a general pattern, global sulfur emissions do not
  rise substantially, and eventually decline, even in absolute terms, during the
  second half of the 21st century (see also Chapters <a href="034.htm">2</a> and
  <a href="049.htm">3</a>). The spatial distribution of emissions changes markedly.
  Emissions in the OECD countries continue their recent declining trend (reflecting
  the tightening of control measures). Emissions outside the OECD rise initially,
  most notably in Asia, which compensates for the declining OECD emissions. Over
  the long term, however, sulfur emissions decline throughout the world, but the
  timing and magnitude vary across the scenarios tightening of control measures).
  Emissions outside the OECD rise initially, most notably in Asia, which compensates
  for the declining OECD emissions. Over the long term, however, sulfur emissions
  decline throughout the world, but the timing and magnitude vary across the scenarios. </p>
<p>
  The SRES scenario set brackets global anthropogenic sulfur emissions between
  27 and 169 MtS by 2050 and between 11 and 93 MtS by 2100 (see <a href="143.htm#tbl62b">Table
  6-2b</a>). The range of emissions for the four markers is smaller. In contrast,
  the range of the IS92 scenarios (Pepper <i>et al</i>., 1992; Alcamo <i>et al</i>.,
  1995) is substantially higher, starting at 80 MtS and extending all the way
  to 200 MtS by 2050 and from 55 to 230 MtS by 2100. The two lowest scenarios,
  IS92c and IS92d, approach the higher end estimates of the SRES scenarios in
  2100, while others are above the SRES range. As mentioned, this difference reflects
  the expected future consequences of recent policies that aim to achieve a drastic
  reduction in sulfur emissions in OECD countries, as well as an anticipated gradual
  introduction of sulfur controls in developing regions in the long-term, as reported
  in the underlying literature (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>). In other words, all SRES scenarios
  assume sulfur control measures, although the uncertainty in timing and magnitude
  of implementation is reflected in the variation across different scenarios.
  Importantly, SRES scenarios assume sulfur controls only and do not assume any
  additional climate policy measures. Nevertheless, one important implication
  of this varying pattern of sulfur emissions is that the historically important,
  but uncertain, negative radiative forcing of sulfate aerosols may decline in
  the very long run. This view is also confirmed by model calculations reported
  in Subak et al. (1997) and Nakicenovic <i>et al</i>. (1998), on the basis
  of recent long-term GHG and sulfur emission scenarios.
