<h1>6.2. Scenario Driving Forces<a name="anc1"></a></h1>
<p>The scenarios cover a wide range of driving forces, from demographic to social
  and economic developments. This section summarizes the assumptions on important
  scenario drivers. For simplicity, only three important driving forces are presented
  separately following the exposition in Chapters <a href="034.htm">2</a>, <a href="049.htm">3</a>,
  and <a href="089.htm">4</a>. Nonetheless, it is important to keep in mind that
  the future evolution of these and other main driving forces is interrelated
  in the SRES scenarios (see <a href="143.htm#tbl62a">Table 6.2a</a> for a summary
  of the ranges of the main driving forces across the scenario groups in 2020,
  2050, and 2100).</p>
<p>The SRES scenarios span a wide range of assumptions for the most salient scenario
  drivers, and thus reflect the uncertainty of the future. Evidently, views of
  the future are a time-specific phenomenon, and this report and its scenarios
  are no exception. However, it is important to emphasize that this is an explicit
  part of the Terms of Reference for the SRES writing team - to reflect a range
  of views, based on current knowledge and the most recently available literature
  (see <a href="146.htm">Appendix I</a>). The scenario quantification results
  reflect well the literature range, except for extreme scenarios.</p>
<h3>6.2.1. Population Projections<a name="anc2"></a></h3>
<p>Three different population trajectories were chosen for SRES scenarios to reflect
  future demographic uncertainties based on published population projections (Lutz,
  1996; UN, 1998; see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>). The population projections
  are exogenous input to all the models used to develop the SRES scenarios. The
  models used do not develop population from other assumptions within the model.
  <a href="#fig62">Figure 6-2</a> shows the three population projections in comparison
  with the three population projections used in the IS92 scenarios. Global population
  ranges between 7 and 15 billion people by 2100 across the scenarios, depending
  on the rate and extent of the demographic transition. The insert in <a href="#fig62">Figure
  6.2</a> shows population development in the industrialized (i.e., developed)
  regions. The range of future populations is smaller than in the IS92 scenarios,
  particularly in the industrialized regions, for which the lowest scenario indicates
  a very modest population decline compared to IS92 scenarios. The greatest uncertainty
  about future growth lies in the developing regions across all scenarios in the
  literature. An equally pervasive trend across all scenarios is urbanization
  (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Altogether three different population
  projections were used in the 26 harmonized scenarios. Other scenarios explored
  alternative population projections consistent with the storylines.</p>
<p>The lowest population trajectory is assumed for the A1 and B1 scenario families
  and is based on the low population projection in Lutz (1996), which combines
  low fertility with low mortality and central migration rate assumptions. After
  peaking at 8.7 billion in the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, world population declines
  to 7.1 billion by the year 2100. As discussed in Chapters <a href="049.htm">3</a>
  and <a href="089.htm">4</a>, this population development is somewhat higher
  than the previous low population used in the IS92 scenarios. The B2 scenario
  family is based on the UN median 1998 population projection (UN, 1998). The
  global population increases to about 9.4 billion people by 2050 and to about
  10.4 billion by 2100. This population scenario is characteristic of recent median
  global population projections, which describe a continuation of historical trends
  towards a completion of the demographic transition that would lead to a level
  global population, and is consistent with recent faster fertility declines in
  the world together with declining mortality rates. Hence, the population is
  somewhat lower than previous UN median projections, as used in the IS92 scenarios.
  This median scenario projects very low population growth in today's industrialized
  countries, with stabilization of growth in Asia in the second half of the 21<sup>st</sup>
  century and in the rest of the world towards the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The
  A2 scenario family is based on the high population growth of 15 billion by 2100
  reported in Lutz (1996), which assumes a significant decline in fertility for
  most regions and a stabilization at above replacement levels. It falls below
  the long-term 1998 UN high projection of 18 billion. It is also lower than in
  the highest IS92 scenario (17.6 billion by 2100). Nevertheless, this scenario
  represents very high population growth compared with that in current demographic
  literature. Demographers attach a probability of more than 90% that actual population
  will be lower than the trajectory adopted in the A2 scenario family (Lutz <i>et
  al</i>., 1997). A more detailed discussion of the population projections used
  to quantify the four scenario families is given in Chapters <a href="049.htm">3</a>
  and <a href="089.htm">4</a>.<br>
