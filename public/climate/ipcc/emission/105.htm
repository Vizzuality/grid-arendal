<h3>4.4.7. Technological Change</h3>
<p><a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a> highlights the importance of technological change in long-run productivity
  growth, but also for the historical transformations of energy end-use and supply
  systems. The importance of technological change in explaining wide-ranging outcomes
  in future emissions has been highlighted by Alcamo et al., (1995) and Grübler
  and Nakicenovic (1996), among others. The latter reference also provides a
  critical assessment of the previous IS92 scenario series and its comparison
  to the literature. Prominent scenario studies of possible technological change
  in future energy systems in the absence of climate policies include Ausubel
  et al. (1988), Edmonds et al. (1994, 1996a), IIASA-WEC (1995), and Nakicenovic
  et al. (1998). Future technology characteristics must therefore be treated as
  dynamic, with future improvement rates subject to considerable uncertainty.
  This is reflected in the SRES scenarios that adopt a wide range of improvement
  rates for energy extraction, conversion, and end-use technologies (<a href="105.htm#411">Table 4-11</a>).
  The actual representation of technological change in the six SRES models ranges
  from exogenously prescribed availability, through cost and performance profiles
  (which in some cases also include consumer or end-use costs for technology use),
  to stylized representation of learning processes<a href="fn5.htm#31" onClick="showFootnote(5,31); return false;"><sup>31</sup></a>.
  Yet, as summarized in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>, model representations
  of technological change are poorly developed, although evolving rapidly.<br>

<h4><br>
  4.4.7.1. A1 Scenarios<a name="4471"></a></h4>
<p>The A1B marker scenario represents the "balanced" technology development group
  of A1 scenarios; it assumes significant innovations in energy technologies,
  which improve energy efficiency and reduce the cost of energy supply. Consistent
  with the A1 scenario storyline, such improvements occur across the board and
  neither favor nor penalize particular groups of technologies. A1 assumes, in
  particular, drastic reductions in power-generation costs, through the use of
  solar, wind, and other modern renewable energies, and significant progress in
  gas exploration, production, and traansport. For a different view, alternative
  scenario groups embedded within the overall A1 scenario family explore pathways
  of cumulative technological change; that is, path-dependent scenarios in which
  technologies evolve on mutually largely exclusive development paths. In general
  this has been the historical experience, in which the success of particular
  energy technologies (the steam engine in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, or internal combustion
  in the 20<sup>th</sup>) have "locked out" other technological alternatives. These scenario
  groups explore alternative spectra of technology dynamics in the domains of
  unconventional oil and gas, coal, as well as post-fossil technologies. Salient
  technology assumptions are described below.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the very different degrees of technological detail and the
  mechanisms for technology improvements represented in the different models,
  a consistent inter-scenario comparison of technology assumptions is best achieved
  within the framework of one particular model. An overview of different technology
  developments for the scenario groups of the A1 scenario is given in <a href="105.htm#box48">Box 4-8</a>
  for the AIM model, which was also used to develop the A1B marker scenario. (A
  comparison with the MARIA model indicated that technology cost assumptions and
  their dynamics are quite congruent.) To illustrate differences in technology
  characteristics that drive the four different SRES scenario families, corresponding
  scenario-specific data based on MESSAGE data are presented at the end of this
  Section.</p>
<h4>4.4.7.2. A1 Scenario Groups<a name="4472"></a></h4>
<p>As outlined above, besides the marker, three different groups of A1 scenarios
  were developed by the different modeling groups (combined into two in the SPM,
  see also <a href="fn5.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(5,1); return false;">footnote
  1 </a>). In total, nine alternative runs are clustered in three scenario groups
  based on the AIM, MARIA, MESSAGE, and MiniCAM models.</p>
<p>In the A1G scenario group, technological change enables a larger fraction of
  the large occurrences of unconventional oil and gas, including oil shales, tar
  sands, and especially methane hydrates (clathrates) to be tapped. High technological
  learning and cost reduction effects could lower unconventional oil and gas extraction
  costs by approximately 1% per year and conversion technology costs by about
  factor of two (A1G-MESSAGE, see Roehrl and Riahi, 2000). As mentioned in <a href="104.htm">Section
  4.4.6</a>, although these assumptions yield higher extractions of unconventional
  oil and gas resources, they are not sufficient to tap significant fractions
  of unconventional resources such as gas clathrates. Future scenario studies
  might reassess the current state of knowledge on possible technology development
  of these "exotic" fossil-fuel occurrences and the conditions under which they
  could become a major future source of unconventional hydrocarbon supply (and
  a massive source of carbon emissions). For the A1G scenario group, substantial
  improvements and extensions of the present pipeline grids and entirely new natural
  gas pipelines systems from Siberia and the Caspian to South East Asia, China,
  Korea, and Japan after 2010/2020 would be needed. Since unconventional oil and
  gas resources are distributed unevenly geographically, the scenario implies
  both capital-intensive infrastructure investments and unprecedented large-scale
  gas and oil trade flows. There is also little pressure to develop non-fossil
  alternatives in such scenarios, so costs of non-fossil alternatives remain comparatively
  high, even after significant technological improvements. For instance, solar
  electricity costs could drop to US$0.05 per kWh (A1G-AIM).<br>

      <p><b>Box 4-8: Technological Change in the AIM-based Quantifications for
	the A1 Scenario Family</b></p>
      <p> The A1 storyline describes a world with rapid economic development.
	High economic growth results in pressures on resource availability, counterbalanced
	by technological progress, which is assumed to be highest among the four
	scenario families. In the AIM quantifications of the A1 storyline, rates
	of technological change are high both with respect to "supply push" factors
	(most notably RD&D) as well as with respect to "demand pull" factors (most
	notably high capital turnover rates). Since large resource availability
	and high incomes stimulate demand growth, technological change in energy
	supply receives a higher emphasis compared to changes in energy end-use
	technologies. Common technology assumptions in the A1 scenarios can be
	summarized as follows. </p>
      <p>The supply of oil, gas, and biomass in the A1 scenario family is assumed
	to be very high and results from high rates of technological progress
	for fossil fuel and biomass exploitation technologies. Unconventional
	oil and gas, such as deep-sea methane hydrates, oil shale, etc., become
	available at relatively low cost. Also, large amounts of biomass are utilized
	through well-developed biomass farm plantations and harvest technologies,
	and biomass utilization technologies, such as biomass power generation
	and biofuel conversion technologies, become available at low costs through
	RD&D and other mechanisms of technology improvements (learning by doing
	and learning by using). High levels in the use of other renewable energy
	are reached when technologies for solar photovoltaics and thermal utilization,
	wind farms, geothermal energy utilization, and ocean energy are introduced
	at low cost. Energy end-use technologies are assumed to progress at medium
	rates compared with the fast rates of technological change in energy supply
	technologies. </p>
      <p>The A1B marker and A1T scenarios assume drastic reductions in cost for
	solar, wind, and other renewable energies. A1C assumes lower coal costs
	and emphasizes coal exploitation technology progress and the introduction
	of advanced coal-fired power generation technology, such as integrated
	gasification combined cycle (IGCC). A1G assumes lower oil and gas costs
	than other A1 scenarios. The cost of nuclear power is assumed to be the
	lowest in A1G and A1T, and highest in A1C. The different cost assumptions
	that drive and result from technological change in the A1 scenario family
	are summarized in <a href="105.htm#412">Table 4-12</a>.<br>

      <p><br>
        As mentioned above, improvements in energy efficiency on the demand side
	are assumed to be comparatively lower in the A1 scenario family, except
	for the A1T scenario, because the low energy prices give very little incentive
	to improve end-use energy efficiencies. Efficient technologies are not
	fully introduced into the end-use side, dematerialization processes in
	the industrial sector are not promoted, lifestyles become energy intensive,
	and private motor vehicles are used more in developing countries as per
	capita incomes increase. As a result, energy efficiency improvement in
	the industrialized countries (IND) is around 0.8% per year, and in developing
	countries (DEV) it is 1.0% per year over the next 100 years to 2100. Only
	A1T assumes greater efficiency improvements (1.1% per year for IND and
	1.5% per year for DEV), as a result of the diffusion of new highly efficient
	energy end-use devices such as fuel cell vehicles.</p>
      <p> Technology progress is also assumed for land-use changes and sulfur
	emissions. Higher productivity increases in biomass and crop land (1.5%
	per year) in comparison to 0.5-1.0%) are assumed for the A1 world in the
	AIM quantification compared to those in the A2 and B2 scenario families.
	Desulfurization technologies could be introduced because of concerns of
	economic damage caused by acid rain and there would be strong financial
	support to install these technologies with the rapid income growth associated
	with the A1 world.</p>
    </td>

</table>
<p><br>
  The high-growth coal-intensive scenario group A1C assumes relatively large
  cost improvements in new and clean coal technologies, such as coal high-temperature
  fuel cells, IGCC power plants, and coal liquefaction. More modest assumptions
  are made for all the other technologies, except for nuclear technologies in
  A1C-MESSAGE, as this requires zero-carbon options to ease resource and environmental
  constraints. The relative costs between coal and oil- or gas-related technologies
  also shift in A1C-AIM. Progress in renewables is also assumed to be substantial.
  For instance, solar photovoltaic costs would decline to USCents3/kWh (A1C-AIM).</p>
<p>In the dynamic technology scenario group A1T, technological change, driven
  by market mechanisms and policies to promote innovation, favors non-fossil technologies
  and synfuels, especially hydrogen from non-fossil sources. Liquid fuels from
  coal, unconventional oil and gas sources, and renewables become available at
  less than US$30 per barrel, with costs that fall further, by about 1% per year,
  through exploitation of learning-curve effects (A1T-MESSAGE). A1T-MARIA also
  projects declining costs for biofuels, from about US$30 to US$20, after the
  2020 period (and in comparison to the A1- MARIA scenario biofuels substitute
  coal-derived synfuels). Non-fossil electricity (e.g., photovoltaics) begin massive
  market penetration at costs of about USCents1 to 3 per kWh (A1T-MARIA, A1T-MESSAGE,
  A1T-AIM), and could continue to improve further (perhaps as low as USCents0.1/kWh
  in A1T-MESSAGE) as a result of learning-curve effects. An important difference
  between the marker scenario A1B and the A1T group is that in A1T additional
  end-use efficiency improvements are assumed to take place with the diffusion
  of new end-use devices for decentralized production of electricity (fuel cells,
  microturbines). As a result, final energy demand in the A1T scenario group is
  between 30% (A1T-AIM, A1T-MESSAGE) and 40% (A1T-MARIA) lower compared to the
  A1B marker scenario.</p>
<h4>4.4.7.3. A2 Scenarios<a name="4473"></a></h4>
<p>The A2 scenario family includes slow improvements in the energy supply efficiency
  and a relatively slow convergence of end-use energy efficiency in the industrial,
  commercial, residential, and transportation sectors between regions. A combination
  of slow technological progress, more limited environmental concerns, and low
  land availability because of high population growth means that the energy needs
  of the A2 world are satisfied primarily by fossil (mostly coal) and nuclear
  energy. However, in some cases regional energy shortages force investments into
  renewable alternatives, such as solar and biomass. For instance, intermittent
  renewable electricity supply options, such as solar and wind, are assumed to
  decline in costs to about USCents4/kWh and (because of storage requirements)
  to about twice that value when these intermittent sources are used for medium
  load applications (50% of electricity supply).</p>
<h4>4.4.7.4. B1 Scenarios<a name="4474"></a></h4>
<p>Consistent with the general environmentally conscious and resource-conservation
  thrust of the B1 scenario storyline, technological change is largely directed
  at improving conversion efficiency rather than costs for fossil technologies.
  Within the SRES Terms of Reference, no additional climate initiatives are assumed
  that could bar the application of certain technologies or yield forced diffusion
  of others. The thermal efficiency of centrally generated electricity is assumed
  to rise to 45% (conventional coal) or to 65% (gas combined cycles) by 2100,
  while specific investment costs decline slightly from 1990 levels. It is assumed
  that subsidies on coal for electricity generation are removed entirely. A specific
  feature of the IMAGE model used to generate the B1 marker scenario is that it
  treats non-fossil electricity generation technologies as highly generic; for
  instance, it does not distinguish between nuclear, solar, or wind-power generation
  technologies. The specific investment costs of generation options for non-fossil
  electricity and of the production and conversion of commercial biofuels are
  assumed to fall by 5-10% for every doubling of cumulated production. Cost decreases
  down to USCents2.5/kWh are anticipated once non-fossil options penetrate on
  a large scale. The costs of gaseous biofuels in the major producing regions
  (Latin America, Africa, NIS) are assumed to be in the order of US$3 to 5 per
  GJ from 2020 to 2030 onward. Liquid biofuels are produced in small amounts in
  almost all regions at costs in the order of US$3 to 6 per GJ. In all regions
  a gradual transition occurs from fossil fuels to non-fossil options in electric-power
  generation, because of rising fuel prices and declining specific investment
  costs for fossil alternatives. Learning rates were assumed, conservatively,
  to yield 2 to 6% cost reductions for every doubling of cumulative production.
  The shift would start in resource-poor industrialized regions such as Japan
  and Western Europe, but is somewhat tempered by rising conversion efficiencies
  of fossil-fueled power plants. One of the factors that constrains the use of
  natural gas in the scenario is the assumption that only a limited part of the
  transport market is open to competition from non-liquid fuels (between 50% around
  2050 to 80% around 2100). Also, the market share of coal in industry is fixed
  exogenously at 10 to 15% in some regions, to reflect the decreasing environmental
  and social attractiveness of the more "dirty" coal.</p>
<h4>4.4.7.5. B2 Scenarios<a name="4475"></a></h4>
<p>The approach that underlies the B2 scenario storyline translates into important
  future improvements of technologies, albeit at more conservative rates than
  in scenarios A1 or B1, but with higher rates than in scenario A2. Compared to
  A1 and B1, cost improvements are more modest, because of the regionally fragmented
  technology policies assumed to characterize a B2 world. Hence, technology-spillover
  effects and benefits from shared development expenditures are more limited in
  the scenario. The high emphasis of environmental protection at the local and
  regional levels is reflected in faster development and diffusion of energy technologies
  with lower emissions, including advanced coal technologies, nuclear, and renewables.
  For instance, solar and wind electricity-generating costs are assumed to decline
  to USCents3/kWh, that is, a similar level as assumed for the long-term costs
  of advanced, clean coal technologies (such as IGCCs). As conventional oil supplies
  dwindle, initially high-cost synfuels from coal and also biofuels are introduced
  as substitutes. With increasing production volume, costs are assumed to decline
  from initial levels of some US$7/GJ to US$2.6/GJ. Conventional coal technologies
  undergo the lowest aggregate rates of improvement in the scenario and are also
  subject to increasing controls of social and environmental externalities (mining
  safety, particulates, and sulfur emissions). Increasingly, therefore, only advanced
  coal technologies are deployed. Nonetheless, extraction and conversion costs
  increase, especially in regions with a large share of deep-mined coal and in
  high population density agglomerations. In regions with abundant surface minable
  coal reserves (e.g., North America and Australia), coal extraction costs remain
  relatively low.</p>
<h4>4.4.7.6. Harmonized and Other Scenarios<a name="4476"></a></h4>
<p>As a consequence of the "multi-model approach" used in SRES, detailed improvement
  assumptions and scenario implementations for individual technologies vary greatly
  from one model to another, although the same storyline characteristics were
  used as guiding principles and many scenarios share similar assumptions on improvement
  potentials for different technologies. Detailed quantitative comparisons are
  difficult because of different time profiles of technology improvements assumed
  in the different models, different representations of regional technology, and
  the modeling of the international diffusion of technology. For instance, many
  models assume aggregate regional rates of technological change (e.g., MARIA,
  MiniCAM, ASF), whereas others attempt to represent spatial and temporal diffusion
  patterns more explicitly (e.g., MESSAGE, AIM).</p>
<p>It is difficult to quantify the influence of varying technology-specific scenario
  assumptions on scenario outcomes, because in most model simulations the technology
  assumptions were varied in conjunction with other salient scenario characteristics,
  such as economic growth and resource availability (e.g. in the MiniCAM simulations).
  Therefore, the impact of alternative assumptions with respect to technological
  change can be best quantified within a particular scenario family and with "fully
  harmonized" scenario quantifications (i.e. with comparable energy demand), as
  discussed for the A1 scenario groups above. In some scenarios within other scenario
  families, technology-specific sensitivity analyses were performed, such as in
  the B2C-MARIA scenario variant of the B2-MARIA quantification. The main differences
  between the two scenarios are the respective costs of coal and nuclear power.
  In B2C-MARIA, the price of coal was assumed to be US$1.4/GJ, while that in B2-MARIA
  is US$1.8/GJ. In contrast, the capital costs of nuclear power stations are US$1400/kW
  in B2-MARIA, while those in B2C-MARIA are assumed to remain at US$1800/kW. Thus,
  even comparatively small variations in relative technology characteristics such
  as costs and efficiencies can lead to wide differences in scenario outcomes.
  As discussed in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>, for instance, changing the relative economics between
  coal and nuclear in the two MARIA scenarios results in a difference of more
  than 200 GtC cumulative emissions<a href="fn5.htm#32" onClick="showFootnote(5,32); return false;"><sup>32</sup></a>
  over the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>An illustration of inter-scenario variability in technology costs and diffusion
  is given in <a href="106.htm#box49">Box 4-9</a> for the MESSAGE model simulations for one representative
  scenario of each scenario family and scenario group. As stated above, differences
  in technology diffusion across scenarios are influenced by many more factors
  than just alternative technology characteristics and cost assumptions. Growth
  of energy demand, resource availability and costs, and local circumstances (local
  air-quality regulations that require desulfurization of fuels or stack gases,
  or land availability and prices that influence biomass costs) are also important
  determinants of speed and potentials for the diffusion of new energy technologies.</p>
