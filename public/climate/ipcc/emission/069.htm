<h4><a name="anc2"></a>3.4.2.3. Residential, Commercial, and Institutional Buildings</h4>
<p>In the buildings sector, household expenditure levels, appliance and equipment
  penetration levels, and the share of population that lives in urban areas all
  affect energy use. In 1990, residential, commercial, and institutional buildings
  consumed almost 100 EJ of primary energy, about one-third of the total global
  primary energy. Uncertainties persist with respect to quantities and structure
  of non-commercial fuel use in developing countries. Primary energy use in the
  buildings sector worldwide grew at an average annual rate of 2.9% between 1971
  and 1990. Growth in buildings energy use varied widely by region, ranging from
  1.8% per year in the IND region to 7.1% per year in the ALM region. Growth in
  commercial buildings was higher than growth in residential buildings in all
  regions of the world, averaging 3.5% per year globally. In 1990, the IND region
  used about 60% of global building energy, followed by REF (22%), ASIA (10%),
  and ALM (9%) countries, respectively. Between 1990 and 1995, growth in the use
  of primary energy in buildings slowed in all regions except the industrialized
  countries, where buildings primary energy use climbed at an average of 1.9%
  per year. The greatest decline occurred in the REF region, where buildings energy
  use declined by an average of 6.8% annually between 1990 and 1995, dominated
  by a 7.2% per year average drop in residential primary energy use. Growth in
  buildings energy use in the other two regions - ASIA and ALM - slowed during
  this period, but growth rates were still high, averaging 4.8% and 3.8%, respectively
  (BP, 1997; IEA, 1997a; IEA, 1997b).</p>
<p>Along with population size, key activity drivers of energy demand in buildings
  are the rate of urbanization, number of dwellings, per capita living area, persons
  per residence, and commercial floor space. As populations become more urbanized
  and areas develop electrification, the demand for energy services such as refrigeration,
  lighting, heating, and cooling increases. In the residential buildings sector,
  the level of energy demand is further influenced by population age distribution,
  household income, number of households, size of dwellings, and number of people
  per household. In the commercial buildings sector, factors that influence energy
  demand include the overall population level (i.e., the number of people who
  desire commercial services), the size of the labor force, and commercial sector
  income.</p>
<p>The number of people living in urban areas increased from 1.35 billion, or
  37% of the total, in 1970 to 2.27 billion, or 43% of the total, in 1990 (see
  also <a href="051.htm#anc1">Section 3.2</a>). Growth in urbanization was strongest
  in the ASIA and ALM regions, where the average annual increase in urban population
  was nearly 4.0% per year. This increase and the resultant income effects led
  to increased usage of commercial fuels, such as kerosene and liquefied petroleum
  gas (LPG), for cooking instead of traditional biomass fuels. In general, higher
  levels of urbanization are associated with higher incomes and increased household
  energy use (Sathaye <i>et al</i>., 1989; Nadel <i>et al</i>., 1997).</p>
<p>Energy consumption in residential buildings is strongly correlated with household
  income levels. Between 1973 and 1993, increases in total private consumption
  translated into larger homes, more appliances, and an increased use of energy
  services (water heating, space heating) in most industrialized countries (IEA,
  1997c). Dwelling size is a key determinant of residential energy use, and has
  grown with personal consumption expenditures in most industrialized countries.
  In the DEV region, urban areas are generally associated with higher average
  incomes (Sathaye and Ketoff, 1991). Wealthier populaces in developing countries
  exhibit consumption patterns similar to those in industrialized countries -
  purchases of appliances and other energy-using equipment increase with gains
  in disposable income (WEC, 1995b).</p>
<p>In the commercial sector, the ratio of primary energy use to commercial sector
  GDP fell in a number of industrialized countries between 1970 and the early
  1990s, despite a large growth in energy-using equipment in commercial buildings.
  Almost certainly this is an effect of improved equipment efficiencies combined
  with economic growth in the commercial sector unrelated to energy consumption.
  Electricity use in the commercial sector shows a relatively strong correlation
  with commercial sector GDP, although there is a wide range of electricity use
  at any given level of commercial sector GDP (IEA, 1997c).</p>
<p>Overall energy intensity in the buildings sector can be measured using energy
  consumption per capita values. Between 1971 and 1990, global primary energy
  use in the buildings sector grew from 16.5 GJ per capita to 20 GJ per capita.
  Buildings per capita energy use varied widely by region, with the IND and REF
  regions dominating globally. Energy use per capita was higher in the residential
  sector than in the commercial sector in all regions, although average annual
  growth in commercial energy use per capita was higher during the period, averaging
  1.7% per year globally compared to 0.6% per year for the residential sector
  (Price <i>et al</i>., 1998)</p>
<p>Space heating is an important end-use in the IND and REF regions and in some
  developing countries; it accounts for half of China's residential and commercial
  building energy demand (Nadel <i>et al</i>., 1997). The penetration of central
  heating doubled, from about 40% of dwellings to almost 80% of dwellings, in
  many industrialized countries between 1970 and 1992 (IEA, 1997c). District heating
  systems are common in some areas of Europe and in the REF region. Space heating
  is not common in most developing countries, with the exception of China, South
  Korea, South Africa, Argentina, and a few other South American countries (Sathaye
  <i>et al</i>., 1989). Residential space-heating energy intensities declined
  in most industrial countries (except Japan) between 1970 and 1992 because of
  reduced heat losses in buildings, lowered indoor temperatures, more careful
  heating practices, and improvements in efficiency of heating equipment (Schipper
  <i>et al</i>., 1996; IEA, 1997c). Water heating, refrigeration, space cooling,
  and lighting are the next largest residential energy uses, respectively, in
  most industrialized countries (IEA, 1997c). In developing countries, cooking
  and water heating dominate, followed by lighting, small appliances, and refrigerators
  (Sathaye and Ketoff, 1991). Appliance penetration rates increased in all regions
  between 1970 and 1990. The energy intensity of new appliances has declined over
  the past two decades - new refrigerators in the US were 65% less energy-intensive
  in 1993 than in 1972 (Schipper <i>et al</i>., 1996).</p>
<p>Primary energy use per square meter of commercial sector floor area has gradually
  declined in most industrial countries, despite countervailing trends such as
  growth in the share of electricity, increases in electricity intensity, and
  reduction in fuel use and fuel intensity. Electricity use and intensity per
  unit area increased rapidly in the commercial buildings sector as the penetration
  of computers, other office equipment, air conditioning, and lighting grew. Fuel
  intensity per unit area declined rapidly in industrialized countries as the
  share of energy used for space heating in commercial buildings dropped because
  of thermal improvements in buildings (Krackeler <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>Carbon intensity of the residential sector declined in most industrialized
  countries between 1970 and the early 1990s (LBL, 1998). In the commercial sector,
  CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions per square meter of commercial floor area also dropped in most
  industrialized countries during this period, even though carbon intensity per
  unit area for electric end-uses increased in most industrialized countries,
  dropping only in France, Sweden, and Norway - countries that moved away from
  fossil fuels (Krackeler <i>et al</i>., 1998). In developing countries, (non-commercial)
  biomass is often used in the residential sector, especially in rural areas.
  Increased urbanization, as well as increases in incomes and rural electrification,
  can lead to rising carbon intensities in buildings when sustainable biomass
  use is replaced with carbon-intensive fuels such as LPG, coal, and electricity
  generated by fossil fuels. Conversely, if biomass use was previously on an unsustainable
  basis, the shift toward commercial fuels can lower carbon intensities. The trend
  toward replacement of biomass fuels by commercial fuels is expected to continue
  in developing countries (IEA, 1995).</p>
<p>In addition to the energy use in buildings, Tiwari and Parikh (1995) drew attention
  to energy use for buildings construction, which accounts for 17% of India's
  carbon emissions in terms of embodied energy in steel, cement, glass, bricks,
  etc. Typically, this embodied buildings energy is accounted for as industrial
  energy use in energy statistics. Tiwari and Parikh (1995) found that in India
  alternative construction methods could save 23% of energy use at 0.03% increase
  in costs.</p>
