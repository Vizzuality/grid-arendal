<p>The final two histograms, Figures <a href="#fig29a">2-9a</a> and <a href="#fig29b">2-9b</a>,
  give the global primary energy consumption ranges for 2050 and 2100, indexed
  to 1990. The total range in 2100 is between 330 EJ and 3400 EJ, which corresponds
  to difference of more than a factor of ten. This factor range is about the same
  as the factor range for gross world product (10.7) and much larger than that
  for population.</p>
<p>The distribution of primary energy consumption in 2050 is asymmetric, with
  a long but thin tail toward high levels. Most of the distribution is between
  600 and 1300 EJ, or about 1.5-3.5 times the 1990 level of consumption. The higher
  value corresponds to the continuation of a historical growth rate of global
  primary energy consumption of about 2.2% per year. Most of the scenarios cluster
  around 1000 EJ, which is about three times that of 1990. A total of 145 different
  scenarios were used to derive this histogram.</p>
<p>In 2100, the distribution of primary energy consumption is much less concentrated
  and covers the full range, from about 10 times the 1990 level (to 3400 EJ) to
  a slight decrease by a factor of 0.9 (340 EJ). However, only a few scenarios
  occur toward these extreme values of the two distribution tails. The rest of
  the observations portray an interesting structure that resembles a trimodal
  distribution. The first mode is around 2600 EJ, the second around 1700 EJ, and
  the third at about 700 EJ. The median of the whole distribution is at 1500 EJ.
  Interestingly, the continuation of the historical growth rate of about 2.2%
  per year corresponds to about 11 times the 1990 level (about 4050 EJ in 2100),
  well above any values observed in the database. Thus, in contrast to data for
  2050, all the scenarios for 2100 foresee a level of primary energy consumption
  that is lower than that of trend extrapolation. Altogether, 127 different scenarios
  were used to derive the histogram for the year 2100. </p>

  <a name="anc2"></a>2.4.10. Relationships between Primary Energy and Gross World Product</h3>
<p>In all scenarios, economic growth outpaces the increase in energy consumption,
  which leads to substantial reductions in the ratio of primary energy consumption
  to gross world product, also known as "energy intensity." Individual technologies
  progress, inefficient technologies are retired in favor of more efficient ones,
  the structure of the energy-supply system and patterns of energy services change;
  these factors reduce the amount of primary energy needed per unit of gross world
  product. With all other factors being equal, the faster the economic growth,
  the higher the turnover of capital, and the greater the decline in energy intensity.</p>
<p>These long-term relationships between energy and economic development are reflected
  in the majority of scenarios and are consistent with historical experience across
  a range of alternative development paths observed in different countries.</p>
<p><a href="#fig210">Figure 2-10</a> shows the historical relationship since 1970
  between energy intensity and GDP per capita for various world regions (see IIASA-WEC,
  1995). This shorter record of development is contrasted with the experience
  of the USA since 1800. Although there are consistent differences among regions
  and energy paths, the level of energy intensities in developing countries today
  is generally comparable with the range of the now-industrialized countries when
  they had the same level of per capita GDP (see <a href="#fig210">Figure 2-10</a>).
  The historical experiences illustrate that different countries and regions can
  follow different development paths; moreover, there are some persistent differences
  in energy intensities even at similar levels of per capita GDP.</p>
<p>Global energy intensities diverge across different scenarios, as shown in the
  shaded wedge in <a href="#fig210">Figure 2-10</a>. The wedge clearly illustrates
  a persistent inverse relationship between economic development and energy intensity
  across the wide range of scenarios in the database, despite numerous differences
  among them.<br>
