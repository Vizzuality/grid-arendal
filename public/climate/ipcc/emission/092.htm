<h3><b><i><a name="4.2.2."></a></i></b>4.2.2. Scenarios<b></b></h3>
<p>All SRES scenarios were designed as quantitative "interpretations" (quantifications)
  of the SRES qualitative storylines. Each scenario is a particular quantification
  of one of the four storylines. The quantitative inputs for each scenario involved,
  for instance, regionalized measures of population, economic development, and
  energy efficiency, the availability of various forms of energy, agricultural
  productivity, and local pollution controls. Each participating modeling group
  (see <a href="091.htm">previous page</a>) used computer models and their experience
  in the assessment of long-range development of economic, technological, and
  environmental systems to generate quantifications of the storylines. The models
  used to develop the scenarios are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Asian Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) from the National Institute of Environmental
    Studies (NIES) in Japan (Morita et al., 1994).</li>
  <li>Atmospheric Stabilization Framework Model (ASF) from ICF Consulting in the
    US (Lashof and Tirpak, 1990; Pepper et al., 1998; Sankovski et al., 2000).</li>
  <li>Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect (IMAGE) from the National
    Institute for Public Health and Hygiene (RIVM) in the Netherlands (Alcamo
    et al., 1998; de Vries et al., 1994, 1999, 2000), used in connection with
    the Central Planning Bureau (CPB) WorldScan model (de Jong and Zalm, 1991),
    the Netherlands.</li>
  <li>Multiregional Approach for Resource and Industry Allocation (MARIA) from
    the Science University of Tokyo in Japan (Mori and Takahashi, 1999; Mori,
    2000).</li>
  <li>Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and their General Environmental
    Impact (MESSAGE) from the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis
    (IIASA) in Austria (Messner and Strubegger, 1995; Riahi and Roehrl, 2000).</li>
  <li>The Mini Climate Assessment Model (MiniCAM) from the Pacific Northwest National
    Laboratory (PNNL) in the USA (Edmonds et al., 1994, 1996a, 1996b).</li>
</ul>
<p>A more detailed description of the modeling approaches is given in Appendix
  IV. Some modeling teams developed scenarios that reflected all four storylines,
  while some presented scenarios for fewer storylines. Some scenarios share harmonized<sup><small><a href="fn5.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(5,2); return false;">2</a></small></sup>
  input assumptions of main scenario drivers, such as population, economic growth,
  and final energy use, with their respective designated marker scenarios of the
  four scenario families and underlying storylines (see <a href="096.htm#1">Section
  4.4.1</a>). Others explore scenario sensitivities in these driving forces through
  alternative interpretations of the four scenario storylines. Table 4-1 lists
  all SRES scenarios, by modeling group and by scenario family, and indicates
  which scenarios share harmonized input assumptions of important driving forces
  of emissions at the global level and at the level of the four SRES regions.
  Altogether, the six modeling teams formulated 40 alternative SRES scenarios</p>
<p>All the qualitative and quantitative features of scenarios that belong to the
  same family were set to conform to the corresponding features of the underlying
  storyline. Quantitative storyline targets recommended for use in all scenarios
  within a given family included, in particular, population and GDP growth assumptions.
  Most scenarios developed within a given family follow these storyline recommendations,
  but some scenarios offer alternative interpretations. Scenarios within each
  family vary quite substantially in such characteristics as the assumptions about
  availability of fossil-fuel resources, the rate of energy-efficiency improvements,
  the extent of renewable-energy development, and, hence, resultant GHG emissions.
  This variation reflects the modeling teams' alternative views on the plausible
  global and regional developments and also stems from differences in the underlying
  modeling approaches. After the modeling teams had quantified the key driving
  forces and made an effort to harmonize them with the storylines by adjusting
  control parameters, possible diversity still remained (see <a href="096.htm#1">Section
  4.4.1</a>).</p>

    <td><b>Figure 4-3</b>: Schematic illustration of the multidimensional
      classification space of SRES scenarios. The set of scenarios consists of
      four scenario families (A1, A2, B1, and B2), each of which consists of a
      number of scenarios. Some of these have "harmonized" inputs - they share
      similar pre-specified global population and GDP trajectories. They are marked
      as "HS" for (globally) harmonized scenarios. All other scenarios of the
      same family based on the quantification of the storyline chosen by the modeling
      team are marked as "OS." The A1 family is divided into four scenario groups
      that explore alternative developments in the future energy sector. These
      were merged into three groups in the SPM (see also footnote 1). Finally,
      one of the harmonized scenarios is designated as the characteristic representative
      of each family and is the marker scenario.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><b><a name="fig43"></a></b>In addition, the A1 scenario family developed into different distinct scenario
  groups, each based on the A1 storyline that describes alternative developments
  in future energy systems, from carbon-intensive development to decarbonization
  (see <a href="fn5.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(5,1); return false;">footnote
  1</a>). (Similar storyline variations were considered for other scenario families,
  but were pursued only to a limited degree in scenario sensitivity analysis in
  order to limit the number of scenarios.) This further increased the richness
  in different GHG emissions paths, because this variation in the structure of
  the future energy system in itself resulted in a range of emissions almost as
  large as that generated through the variation of other main driving forces,
  such as population and economic development. The differentiation into various
  scenario groups was introduced into the A1 storyline because of its "high growth
  with high technology" nature, in which differences in alternative technology
  developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels.</p>
<p>As for the storylines, no single scenario was treated as more or less "probable"
  than others belonging to the same family. However, after requests from various
  user communities to reduce the number of scenarios to a manageable size, a single
  scenario within a family was selected as a representative case to illustrate
  a particular storyline on the basis of the modeling teams' consensus. These
  scenarios were named "marker scenarios" or simply "markers" and were put on
  the SRES open process webpage for review. The marker scenario for the A1 scenario
  storyline was developed using the AIM model; for the A2 storyline using the
  ASF model; for the B1 storyline using the IMAGE model; and finally for the B2
  storyline using the MESSAGE model (see <a href="#table4.1">Table 4-1</a>).</p>
<p>The choice of the markers was based on extensive discussion within the SRES
  team:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which of the initial quantifications (by the models) reflected the story
    best.</li>
  <li>Preference of some of the modeling teams and features of specific models.</li>
  <li>Range of emissions across all the markers.</li>
  <li>Use of different models for the four markers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1998, the preliminary descriptions and quantifications of the marker scenarios
  were posted on the SRES website for the open process and, in accordance with
  a decision of the IPCC Bureau, were in this way made available to climate modelers
  for their input in the Third Assessment Report. As a result of the inputs and
  comments received through the open process and by the entire writing team, the
  marker scenarios have been successively refined and improved without changing
  their fundamental characteristics in terms of important scenario driving forces
  (population, GDP) and order of magnitude of GHG emissions. Subsequently, additional
  scenarios within each scenario family were developed to explore the sensitivity
  of adopting alternative quantitative scenario input assumptions on future GHG
  emissions. As a result the markers are not necessarily the median or mean of
  a scenario family (nor would it be possible to construct such a median or mean
  scenario by taking all salient scenario characteristics and regional results
  into account). The markers are simply those scenarios considered by the SRES
  writing team as illustrative of a particular storyline. They are not singled
  out as more likely than alternative quantitative interpretations of a particular
  scenario family and its underlying storyline. Perhaps they may be best described
  as "first among equals." However, as a result of time and resource limitations
  the marker scenarios have received the closest scrutiny from the entire writing
  team and through the SRES open process compared to other scenario quantifications.
  The marker scenarios are also the SRES scenarios most intensively tested in
  terms of reproducibility. As a rule, at least four different models were used
  in attempts to replicate the model quantification of a particular marker scenario.
  Available time and resources did not allow a similar exercise to be conducted
  for all SRES scenarios, albeit a more limited effort was devoted to reproduce
  the A1 scenario groups (next to the A1 marker) with different models.</p>
<p>To enable a comparison of the resultant GHG emissions, the writing team decided
  to define a subset of harmonized scenarios within each family that share common
  main scenario driving-force assumptions, such as population or GDP growth. Two
  harmonization criteria were developed (see also <a href="096.htm#1">Section
  4.4.1</a>). This procedure and the harmonization criteria were adopted in a
  joint agreement among the six SRES modeling teams.</p>
<p>"Fully harmonized" scenarios are those that share important driving force variables,
  including population, GDP, and final energy use for each of the four SRES regions
  and the world (according to the quantitative criteria listed in <a href="#table4.1">Table
  4-1</a>). Fully harmonized scenarios by definition include the respective marker
  scenario. From 40 scenarios 11 are classified as scenarios with "full harmonization."
  For each scenario family at least two scenarios are harmonized using the most
  restrictive criteria. This also applies to the scenario groups within the A1
  scenario family, which correspondingly has the highest number of fully harmonized
  scenarios. This subset of "fully harmonized" scenarios serves to provide a better
  correspondence between the development of the three main driving forces and
  the resultant GHG emissions. The "fully harmonized" scenarios thus demonstrate
  the degree by which a particular marker scenario is reproducible by alternative
  modeling approaches. Therefore, "fully harmonized" scenarios are not independent
  from each other within a particular scenario family (or scenario group in case
  of A1).</p>
<p>"Globally harmonized" scenarios are those that share global population and
  GDP profiles within the agreed upon bounds of 5% and 10%, respectively, over
  the period 1990-2100<a href="fn5.htm#3" onClick="showFootnote(5,3); return false;"><sup>3</sup></a>
  (see <a href="#table4.1">Table 4-1</a>). Altogether 26<sup>
  <a href="fn5.htm#4" onClick="showFootnote(5,4);
  return false;">4</a></sup> scenarios are categorized into this category and
  can be considered to capture the main global development characteristics over
  time for each respective scenario family and storyline. Again these 26 scenarios
  are not independent from each other, constituting seven distinct scenario groups
  (see also <a href="fn5.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(5,1); return false;">footnote

<p>Thus, there are three different types of scenarios within each family:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One marker and a set of "fully harmonized" scenarios that attempt to replicate
    the marker scenario quantification.</li>
  <li>A set of "globally harmonized" scenarios.</li>
  <li>A set of non-harmonized scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, two illustrative scenarios have been selected in the Summary for
  Policymakers (SPM) from the additional A1 scenario groups (see also <a href="fn5.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(5,1); return false;">footnote 1</a>).</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, the term "harmonized" is used herein to describe
  global harmonization of population and GDP growth. "Fully harmonized" scenarios,
  for which the main objective is to assess the reproducibility of particular
  marker scenario quantifications and any remaining uncertainty in GHG emissions
  from internal model parametrizations, are referred to in the text where appropriate.
  <a href="092.htm#fig43">Figure 4-3</a> shows the SRES scenarios as a set consisting
  of subsets that correspond to the four families. The A1 family is in addition
  divided into different groups of scenarios. The detailed descriptions of inputs
  and outputs (other than GHG emissions) of the SRES marker scenarios, other harmonized
  scenarios, and other scenarios are presented in Section 4.4 (see <a href="164.htm">Appendix
  VII</a> for further numeric detail). The emissions of GHGs and other radiatively
  important species of gases are described in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>
  (more detail is again presented in <a href="164.htm">Appendix VII</a>).</p>
<p>Table 4-2 summarizes the main characteristics of the four SRES scenario families
  and their scenario groups, and gives an overview about the number of scenarios
  that were developed for each scenario group (see also <a href="#table4.1">Table
  4-1</a> and <a href="096.htm#1">Section 4.4.1</a>).<br>
