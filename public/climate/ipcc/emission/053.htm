<h4><a name="anc1"></a>3.2.3.3. Recent Developments in Demographic Projections </h4>
<h5><a name="anc2"></a>3.2.3.3.1. Downward revisions in population projections</h5>
<p>The UN 1996 Revision generated substantial press attention in 1997 because
  it forecast nearly 500 million fewer people in 2050 than it had in 1994. The
  base year of data for the UN 1996 Revision is 1995, whereas in the 1994 Revision
  fertility, mortality, and migration rates for 1995 are forecast. The reduction
  in the population projection largely results from more accurate data available
  for 1995 (UN, 1997b, 1997c). The major change was the lower-than-anticipated
  world average fertility of 2.96 children per woman during the period 1990-1995,
  as compared with 3.10 children per woman assumed in the 1994 Revision. The main
  reason for this decrease is a faster-than-anticipated decline in fertility in
  a number of countries in south central Asia, Bangladesh and India, and Sub-Saharan
  Africa, Kenya, and Rwanda (UN, 1997c). Other important regional declines in
  fertility also took place in Brazil, the former Soviet republics, and the newly
  independent states in eastern and southern Europe (Haub, 1997). Higher-than-anticipated
  mortality rates in a number of countries afflicted by wars and the spread of
  AIDS also contributed to the downward population revision.</p>
<h5><a name="anc3"></a>3.2.3.3.2. Demographic impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic</h5>
<p>Both the UN and the World Health Organization (WHO) conduct ongoing surveys
  of the global HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and AIDS epidemic. The most
  recent surveys indicate that at the beginning of 1998 30.6 million people were
  infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and 11.7 million people have
  already lost their lives to the disease (UNAIDS and WHO, 1998).</p>
<p>Since the impact of HIV and AIDS on mortality rates is greatest in the sub-Saharan
  region, the impact of the epidemic on population growth will be greatest there.
  One study (Bongaarts, 1996) suggests that by 2005 the annual population growth
  rates (expressed as "persons increase per thousand population") in sub-Saharan
  Africa will be about 1.4 persons per thousand lower than would have occurred
  in the absence of the disease. Other regions, however, will experience a much
  smaller impact in population growth so that the AIDS-related deficit in world
  population growth rate will be only -0.4 persons per thousand in 2005. The reason
  for the modest impact is that birth rates in many developing countries are much
  higher than the death rates, so the AIDS increase in mortality only partially
  offsets this larger difference.</p>
<h5><a name="anc4"></a>3.2.3.3.3. The correlation between fertility and mortality</h5>
<p>In the recently published IIASA population projections (Lutz, 1996), the correlations
  of fertility and mortality rates are also different to those of the UN projections.
  Within IIASA the main scenarios are labeled "central,""rapid transition,""slow
  transition,""high," and "low." In the two "transition" scenarios, mortality
  rates and fertility rates are correlated so that low or high mortality accompanies
  low or high fertility, respectively, in line with conventional wisdom among
  demographers that fertility declines are associated with mortality declines.
  This correlation narrows the range of projected population size as compared
  with an anticorrelation assumption. The "high" and "low" scenarios, by contrast,
  anticorrelate mortality and fertility and are considered quite unlikely.</p>
<h5><a name="anc1"></a>3.2.3.3.4. Probabilistic population projections</h5>
<p>Another recent development in demographic projections is that of probabilistic
  scenarios. Lutz <i>et al</i>. (1997) consider, based on their probabilistic
  population projections, a doubling of world population unlikely. Their scenarios
  use fertility, mortality, and migration rate assumptions based on a Gaussian
  fit to a survey of demographic experts who were asked to give a range of rates
  for each region that they considered to cover the 90th percentile probability
  range. Given the Gaussian curve fits to the expert data, a Monte Carlo simulation
  was run to generate 4000 scenarios, with five-year timesteps, which have a probability
  distribution attached to them. The branch points in the fertility, mortality,
  and net migration rate curves, based on the expert data, were set in 1995, 2000,
  2030, and 2080. The probabilistic projections extend to 2100. The 5th and 95th
  percentile intervals are between 6.7 to 15.6 billion people by 2100, a range
  that usefully covers current knowledge on the uncertainty of future world population
  levels to be considered in SRES. It should be noted that such probability assignments
  derived from expert opinion are inherently subjective and do not necessarily
  suggest a corresponding likelihood of future occurrence.</p>
