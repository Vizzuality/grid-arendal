<p>The 40 SRES scenarios cover the full range of GHG and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions consistent
  with the storylines and underlying ranges of driving forces from studies in
  the literature as documented in the SRES database. The four marker scenarios
  are characteristic of the four scenario families and jointly capture most of
  the ranges of emissions and driving forces spanned by the full set of scenarios.
  <a href="#fig16">Figure 1-6</a> illustrates the range of global energy-related
  and industrial CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions for the 40 SRES scenarios against the background
  of all the emissions scenarios in the SRES scenario database shown in <a href="029.htm#fig13">Figure
  1-3</a>. <a href="#fig16">Figure 1-6</a> also shows a range of emissions of
  the four scenario families.</p>
<p><a href="#fig16">Figure 1-6</a> shows that the SRES scenarios cover most of
  the range of global energy-related CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from the literature, from the
  95th percentile at the high end of the distribution down to low emissions just
  above the 5th percentile of the distribution. Thus, they only exclude the most
  extreme emissions scenarios found in the literature - those situated in the
  tails of the distribution. What is perhaps more important is that each of the
  four scenario families covers a sizable part of this distribution, which implies
  that a similar quantification of driving forces can lead to a wide range of
  future emissions. More specifically, a given combination of the main driving
  forces is not sufficient to uniquely determine a future emissions path. There
  are too many uncertainties. The fact that each of the scenario families covers
  a substantial part of the literature range also leads to an overlap in the emissions
  ranges of the four families. This implies that a given level of future emissions
  can arise from very different combinations of driving forces. This result is
  of fundamental importance for the assessment of climate-change impacts and possible
  mitigation and adaptation strategies. Thus, it warrants some further discussion.
  The emissions paths of the A1 and B2 scenario families perhaps best illustrate
  these implications.</p>
<p>The A1 scenario family has explored variations in energy systems most explicitly
  and hence covers the largest part of the scenario distribution shown in <a href="031.htm#fig16">Figure
  1-6</a>, from the 95<sup>th</sup> to just above the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile. The A1 marker (A1B) scenario
  represents a structure of the future energy mix, balanced in the sense that
  it does not rely too heavily on one particular energy source. The A1 scenario
  family includes different groups of scenarios that explore different specific
  structures of future energy systems, from carbon-intensive development paths
  to high rates of decarbonization as captured by the two illustrative scenarios
  that span most of the emissions range for the A1 family. All groups otherwise
  share the same assumptions about the main driving forces. This indicates that
  different structures of the energy system can lead to basically the same variation
  in future emissions as can be generated by different combinations of the other
  main driving forces - population, economic activities and energy consumption
  levels. The implication is that decarbonization of energy systems - the shift
  from carbon-intensive to less carbon-intensive and carbon-free sources of energy
  - is of similar importance in determining the future emissions paths as other
  driving forces. Sustained decarbonization requires the development and successful
  diffusion of new technologies. Thus investments in new technologies during the
  coming decades might have the same order of influence on future emissions as
  population growth, economic development and levels of energy consumption taken
  together.</p>
<p>For example, the comparison of the A1B and B2 marker scenarios indicates that
  they have similar emissions of about 13.5 and 13.7 GtC by 2100, respectively.
  The dynamics of the paths are different so that they have different cumulative
  CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions. To facilitate such comparisons, the scenarios were grouped into
  four categories of cumulative emissions between 1990 and 2100. This categorization
  can guide comparisons using either scenarios with different driving forces yet
  similar emissions, or scenarios with similar driving forces but different emissions.
  This characteristic of SRES scenarios also has very important implications for
  the assessment of climate-change impacts, mitigation and adaptation strategies.
  Two future worlds with fundamentally different characteristic features, such
  as A1B and B2 marker scenarios, also have different cumulative CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions
  and radiative forcing, but very similar CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions in 2100. In contrast,
  scenarios that are in the same category of cumulative emissions can have fundamentally
  different driving forces and different CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions in 2100, but very similar
  cumulative emissions and radiative forcing. Presumably, adverse impacts and
  effective adaptation measures would vary among the scenarios from different
  families that share similar cumulative emissions but have different demographic,
  socio-economic and technological driving forces. This is another reason for
  considering the entire range of future emissions in future assessments of climate
  change. There is no single "best guess" or central scenario.</p>
<p>The SRES emissions scenarios also have different emissions for other GHGs and
  chemically active species such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile
  organic hydrocarbons. The emissions of other gases follow dynamic patterns much
  like those shown in <a href="031.htm#fig16">Figure 1-6</a> for CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions.
  Further details about GHG emissions are given in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>.
  Emissions of sulfur aerosol precursors portray even more dynamic patterns in
  time and space than the CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions shown in <a href="031.htm#fig16">Figure
  1-6</a>. Factors other than climate change, namely regional and local air quality,
  and transformations in the structure of the energy system and end use intervene
  to limit future emissions. In view of the significant adverse impacts, SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions
  in the scenarios are increasingly controlled outside countries of the OECD.
  As such the SRES scenarios reflect both recent legislation in North America
  and in Europe and recent policy initiatives in a number of developing countries
  aimed at reducing SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions (reviewed in more detail in Chapters <a href="049.htm">3</a>
  and <a href="114.htm">5</a>). As a result, in the second half of the 21 st century
  both the trends and regional patterns of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions evolve differently from
  those of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions in the SRES scenarios. Emissions outside OECD90 rise
  initially, most notably in ASIA, and compensate for declining OECD90 emissions.
  Over the long term, however, SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions decline throughout the world, but
  the timing and magnitude vary across the scenarios. One important implication
  of this varying pattern of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions is that the historically important,
  but uncertain negative radiative forcing of sulfate aerosols may decline in
  the very long run.</p>
<p>An important feature of the SRES scenarios is their implications for radiative
  forcing. A vigorous increase of global SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions during the next few decades
  across most of the scenarios followed by a decline thereafter will lead to a
  cooling effect that will differ from the effect that results from the continuously
  increasing SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in the IS92 scenarios. On one hand, the reduction in
  global SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions reduces the role of sulfate aerosols in determining future
  climate toward the end of the 21st century and therefore reduces one aspect
  of uncertainty about future climate change (because the precise forcing effect
  of sulfate aerosols is highly uncertain). On the other hand, uncertainty increases
  because of the diversity in spatial patterns of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in the scenarios.
  Future assessments of possible climate change need to account for these different
  spatial and temporal dynamics of GHG and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions, and they need to cover
  the whole range of radiative forcing associated with the scenarios.</p>

	  of SRES scenarios. The set of scenarios consists of four scenario families:
	  A1, A2, B1 and B2. Scenario family A1 is further subdivided into four
	  scenario groups: A1C, A1G, A1B and A1T, (see also note below), resulting
	  in seven scenario groups together with the other three scenario families.
	  Each family and group consists of a number of scenarios. Some of them
	  have "harmonized" driving forces and share the same prespecified population
	  and gross world product (a few that also share common final energy trajectories
	  are called "fully harmonized"). These are marked as "HS" for harmonized
	  scenarios. One of the harmonized scenarios, originally posted on the
	  open-process web site, is called a "marker scenario." All other scenarios
	  of the same family based on the quantification of the storyline chosen
	  by the modeling team are marked as "OS." Six modeling groups developed
	  the set of 40 emissions scenarios. The GHG and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions of the
	  scenarios were standardized to share the same data for 1990 and 2000
	  on request of the user communities. The time-dependent standardized

        <p align="left"><b>SRES Terminology<br>
	  Model: </b>a formal representation of a system that allows quantification
	  of relevant system variables. <br>
	  <b>Storyline:</b> a narrative description of a scenario (or a family
	  of scenarios) highlighting the main scenario characteristics, relationships
	  between key driving forces, and the dynamics of the scenarios. <br>
	  <b>Scenario:</b> a description of a potential future, based on a clear
	  logic and a quantified storyline. <br>
	  <b>Family: </b>scenarios that have a similar demographic, societal,
	  economic and technical-change storyline. Four scenario families comprise
	  the SRES: A1, A2, B1 and B2. <br>
	  <b>Group: </b>scenarios within a family that reflect a variation of
	  the storyline. The A1 scenario family includes four groups designated
	  by A1T, A1C, A1G and A1B (see also note below) that explore alternative
	  structures of future energy systems. In the Summary for Policymakers,
	  the A1C and A1G groups have been combined into one "fossil intensive"
	  A1FI scenario group, thus reducing the number of groups constituting
	  the A1 scenario family to three. The other three scenario families consist
	  of one group each. <br>
	  <b>Category:</b> scenarios are grouped into four categories of cumulative
	  CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions between 1990 and 2100: low, medium-low, medium-high, and
	  high emissions. Each category contains scenarios with a range of different
	  driving forces yet similar cumulative emissions. <br>
	  <b>Marker:</b> a scenario that was originally posted on the SRES web
	  site to represent a given scenario family. A marker is not necessarily
	  the median or mean scenario. <br>
	  <b>Illustrative:</b> a scenario that is illustrative for each of the
	  six scenario groups reflected in the Summary for Policymakers of this
	  report (after combining A1G and A1C into a single A1FI group). They
	  include four revised "scenario markers" for the scenario groups A1B,
	  A2, B1 and B2, and two additional illustrative scenarios for the A1FI
	  and AIT groups. See also "(Scenario) Groups" and "(Scenario) Markers."
	  <br>
	  <b>Harmonized: </b>harmonized scenarios within a family share common
	  assumptions for global population and GDP while fully harmonized scenarios
	  are within 5% of the population projections specified for the respective
	  marker scenario, within 10% of the GDP and within 10% of the marker
	  scenario's final energy consumption. <br>
	  <b>Standardized:</b> emissions for 1990 and 2000 are indexed to have
	  the same values. <br>
	  <b>Other scenarios:</b> scenarios that are not harmonized. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Note:</b> During the approval process of the Summary
	  for Policymakers at the 5<sup>th</sup> Session of WGIII of the IPCC from 8-11 March
	  2000 in Katmandu, Nepal, it was decided to combine the A1C and A1G groups
	  into one "fossil intensive" group A1FI in contrast to the non-fossil
	  group A1T, and to select two illustrative scenarios from these two A1
	  groups to facilitate use by modelers and policy makers. This leads to
	  six scenario groups that constitute the four scenario families, three
	  of which are in the A1 family. These six groups all have "illustrative
	  scenarios," four of which are marker scenarios. All scenarios are equally
	  sound. See also <a href="003.htm#spm1">Figure SPM-1</a>. </p>
