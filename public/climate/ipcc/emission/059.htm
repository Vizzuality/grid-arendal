<h3>3.3.3. Scenarios of Economic Development<a name="anc1"></a></h3>
<p>Unlike population projections, no long-term economic-development scenarios
  are available in the literature (for an earlier review, see Jefferson, 1983).
  In fact, for economic projections "long term" means time horizons of up to a
  decade (e.g., World Bank, 1997b), 1998b, far too short for the time frame addressed
  in this report. The longest time frames for economic growth projections available
  in the literature extend to 2015 (e.g., Maddison, 1998) and 2020 (World Bank,
  1997b). The need for long-term economic growth scenarios has arisen primarily
  in connection with long-term energy and (1986), Gr�bler (1994), and Alcamo et
  al. (1995). An expert poll on uncertainty in future GDP growth projections is
  reported in Manne and Richels (1994). Recent scenario assumptions are reviewed
  in <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a> above.</p>
<p>The current state of modeling long-term economic growth is not well developed,
  not least because the dominant forces of long-run productivity growth, such
  as the role of institutions and technological change (see <a href="060.htm">Section
  3.3.4</a>), remain exogenous to models. As a result, productivity growth assumptions
  enter scenario calculations as exogenous input assumptions. The structural changes
  in the economy discussed in the previous paragraph result in additional difficulties;
  notably that service sector productivity growth is difficult to evaluate and
  project.</p>

<p><a href="#fig310">Figure 3-10</a> summarizes the results of the analysis of
  available literature data on per capita economic growth, disaggregated into
  global as well as industrial and developing countries.</p>
<p>Overall, uncertainty concerning productivity and hence per capita GDP growth
  is considerable. Uncertainties in productivity growth rates become amplified
  because even small differences in productivity growth rates in all scenarios,
  when compounded over a time frame of a century or more into the future, translate
  into enormous differences in absolute levels of per capita GDP. For instance,
  in the scenarios reviewed in Alcamo <i>et al</i>. (1995) and Gr�bler (1994)
  per capita GDP growth rates range typically between 0.8 and 2.8% per year over
  the period 1990-2100. On the basis of an average global per capita income of
  US$4000 in 1990, global per capita GDP could range anywhere between about US$10,000
  to about US$83,000 by 2100. Such uncertainties are amplified even more when
  regional disaggregations are considered, in particular future productivity growth
  in developing countries. The range of views spans all the extremes between developing
  countries that lag perennially behind current income levels in the OECD, to
  scenarios in which they catch up.</p>
<p>These ranges are reflected in the SRES scenarios shown in <a href="#fig310">Figure
  3-10</a>. Exogenously assumed productivity growth rates correspond to alternative
  qualitative interpretations as to how the future could unfold, ranging from
  SRES low (all-min) to SRES high (all-max) rates. Extreme scenarios of productivity
  growth or lack of growth have not been explored because the SRES terms of reference
  cover a qualified range from the literature; methodological (and model) pluralism
  is mandatory (extreme scenarios can be reflected across a wide range of modeling
  approaches only to a limited degree). Furthermore, it is not possible to treat
  uncertainties of future demographic, economic, and technological developments
  as independent. This is shown by the conclusions of recent scenario evaluation
  exercises (Alcamo et al., 1995) as well as by theoretical and empirical evidence
  (e.g. Abramovitz, 1993; Barro, 1997). Thus, contrary to the previous IPCC IS92
  scenario series (that varied salient scenario driving forces independently of
  each other), the SRES scenarios attempt to incorporate advances in the understanding
  of the relationships between important scenario drivers. From this perspective,
  uncertainties about future productivity and hence economic growth are not parametric,
  but rather are related to the uncertainties in current understanding and modeling
  of the interactions between demographics, productivity growth, and socio-institutional
  and technological change. These are addressed in <a href="060.htm">Section 3.3.4</a>.</p>
