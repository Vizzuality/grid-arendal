<h4>5.4.3.2. Perfluorocarbons</h4>
<p>PFCs, fully fluorinated hydrocarbons, have extremely long atmospheric lifetimes
  (2600 to 50,000 years) and particularly high radiative forcing (<a href="123.htm">Table
  5-7</a>). The production of aluminum is thought to be the largest source of
  PFCs (CF<small><sub>4</sub></small> , and C<small><sub>2</sub></small>F<small><sub>6</sub></small>) emissions. These emissions are generated, primarily, by
  the anode effect, which occurs during the reduction of alumina (aluminum oxide)
  in the primary smelting process as alumina concentrations become too low in
  the smelter. Under these conditions, the electrolysis cell voltage increases
  sharply to a level sufficient for bath electrolysis to replace alumina electrolysis.
  This causes substantial energy loss and the release of fluorine, which reacts
  with carbon to form CF<small><sub>4</sub></small> and C<small><sub>2</sub></small>F<small><sub>6</sub></small>.</p>
<p>In 1990, the total annual global primary aluminum production was 19.4 Mt. Secondary
  aluminum production from recycling accounted for 21.5% of the total consumption
  in 1990. The production statistics from the World Bureau of Metal Statistics
  (1997) show that the total aluminum production was 27.5 Mt, and recycling has
  increased to 25.6%, or by about 3.5 percentage points, in 10 years.</p>
<p>The scenarios developed by Fenhann (2000) adopt a methodology of projecting
  future aluminum demand based on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aluminum consumption elasticity with respect to GDP. </li>
  <li>Use of alternative assumptions concerning recycling rates. </li>
  <li>Varying emission factors to reflect future technological change.</li>
</ul>
<p>These assumptions are altered to be in consistent with the four SRES scenario
  storylines described in <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, in Fenhann (2000) the aluminum consumption elasticity varies
  between 0.8 and 0.96, and the range of increases in aluminum recycling rates
  varies between 1.5 and 3.5 percentage points per decade. The PFC emission factor
  varies according to the aluminum production technology used. The default emission
  factor from the Revised IPCC Guidelines (IPCC, 1997) is 1.4 kgCF<small><sub>4</sub></small> /t aluminum.
  However, Harnisch (1999) gives evidence that the average specific emissions
  of CF<small><sub>4</sub></small> per ton of aluminum has decreased from about 1.0 kg to 0.5 kg between
  1985 and 1995. Accordingly, an emissions factor of 0.8 kgCF<small><sub>4</sub></small>/t was used for
  1990 and this was assumed to decrease to 0.5 kg CF<small><sub>4</sub></small>/t in the future. This is
  also in agreement with the value of 0.51 kgCF<small><sub>4</sub></small>/t recommended by the IPCC Expert
  Meeting on Good Practices in Inventory Preparation for Industrial Processes
  and the New Gases (January 1999, Washington, DC). The same sources also agree
  on an emission factor for C<small><sub>2</sub></small>F<small><sub>6</sub></small> that is 10 times lower than that for CF<small><sub>4</sub></small> . This
  assumption was also used in the calculations presented here (<a href="123.htm#tab58">Table
  5-8</a>).</p>
<p>Aluminum production is being upgraded from highly inefficient smelters and
  practices to reduce the frequency and duration of the anode effect. Since aluminum
  smelters are large consumers of energy, the costs of these modifications are
  offset by savings in energy costs and are therefore assumed to occur in all
  scenarios. The ultimate reduction of the anode effect frequency and duration
  was assumed to reach the same level in all the SRES scenarios. However, scenarios
  vary with respect to the rate of introducing the underlying modifications. It
  is technically possible to reduce the anode emissions by a factor of 10 (EU,
  1997). This technically feasible reduction can be achieved by changing from
  the Söderberg cells currently in use to more modern pre-bake cells. It is assumed
  that this will happen in the A1 and B1 family scenarios, in which specific emissions
  of 0.15 kgCF<small><sub>4</sub></small>/t are achieved by 2040 in the OECD90 region and by 2090 in the
  other regions. In the A2 and B2 family scenarios the same specific emissions
  are achieved later in the century in the OECD90 region and not until after 2100
  in the other regions.</p>
<p>PFCs are consumed in small amounts in such sectors as electronics (tracers),
  cosmetics, and medical applications. However, the only emissions included in
  Fenhann (2000) beyond aluminum production were PFCs (as CF<small><sub>4</sub></small>) from semiconductor
  production. In all SRES scenarios the emission estimates used are those given
  by Harnisch et al. (1999) of 0.3 kt CF<small><sub>4</sub></small> per year in 1990, 1.1 ktCF<small><sub>4</sub></small> in 2000,
  1.0 ktCF<small><sub>4</sub></small> in 2010, and constant thereafter. The use of these estimates reflects
  the voluntary agreement, in April 1999, of the World Semiconductor Council,
  which represent manufacturers from Europe, Japan, Korea , and the US, among
  others. According to this agreement, manufacturers have adopted the emission
  reduction target for PFCs of 10% absolute reduction from 1995 emission levels
  by 2010. This target encompasses over 90% of the total semiconductor production
  (WMO/UNEP, 1999). The total PFC emissions in the four SRES scenario families
  cover a range from 24 to 97 kt PFC in 2100 (<a href="123.htm#tab58">Table 5-8</a>;
  Fenhann, 2000).</p>
<h4>5.4.3.3. Sulfur hexafluoride<a name="5433"></a></h4>
<p>SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> is an extremely stable atmospheric trace gas. All studies concur that this
  gas is entirely anthropogenic. Its unique physico-chemical properties make SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>
  ideally suited for many specialized industrial applications. Its 100-year GWP
  of 23,900 is the highest of any atmospheric trace gas. In 1994, atmospheric
  concentrations of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> were reported to rise by 6.9% per year, which is equivalent
  to annual emissions of 5,800t SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> (Maiss et al., 1996).</p>
<p>According to several sources (Kroeze, 1995; Maiss et al., 1996; Victor and
  MacDonald, 1998), about 80% of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> emissions originate from its use as an insulator
  in high-voltage electrical equipment. The remaining 20% of the present global
  SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> emissions (1200 tons per year) are emitted from magnesium foundries, in
  which SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> is used to prevent oxidation of molten magnesium. The global annual
  production of magnesium is about 350,000 tons (US Geological Survey, 1998),
  and developing countries account for about 15% of the total. SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> is also used
  to de-gas aluminum, but since SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> reacts with aluminum, little or no atmospheric
  emissions result from this process.</p>
<p>Major manufacturers of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> agreed voluntarily to co-operate on the compilation
  of worldwide SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> sales data by end-use markets. Six companies from the US (three),
  Japan, Italy, and Germany participated in the data survey. The companies do
  not expect the total sales for magnesium foundries to increase before 2000 (Science
  & Policy Services Inc., 1997). Based on this information, the 1996 statistical
  production values were used for the year 2000 in the formulation of the scenarios
  reported in Fenhann (2000). Future production was projected assuming the same
  consumption elasticity to GDP as for aluminum (see discussion above). In 1996,
  about 41% of the world magnesium was produced in the US; of this, only 16% was
  processed in foundries for casting that resulted in emissions of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> (Victor
  and MacDonald, 1998). Since the distribution of world foundry capacity appears
  to be roughly similar to that of world magnesium production, Fenhann (2000)
  assumes that, presently, 16% of the produced magnesium is processed in foundries
  across all regions. Relating this amount of the processed magnesium to the aforementioned
  emission of 1200t SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> per year yields an emission factor of 21kg SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> per ton
  of magnesium processed in foundries. The demand for magnesium in automotive
  applications as a strong lightweight replacement for steel is growing quickly.
  Hence, it is expected that the fraction of total magnesium production processed
  in foundries by 2050 will grow to between two to three times the present level.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, no less than 80% of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> emissions (or 4600 tons of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>
  per year at present) originate from the use of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> as a gaseous insulator in
  high-voltage electrical equipment. The unique ability of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> to quench electric
  arcs has enabled the development of safe, reliable gas-insulated high-voltage
  breakers, substations, transformers, and transmission lines. The demand for
  such electrical equipment is assumed to grow proportionally to electricity demand
  (Victor and MacDonald, 1998; Fenhann, 2000) with an emission factor of 132.6t
  SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>/EJ electricity. Fenhann (2000) used preliminary electricity generation projections
  from the four SRES marker scenarios and assumed additional various other potentials
  for emission reductions that result from more careful handling, recovery, recycling,
  and substitution of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> . Reduction rates vary in the different SRES scenario
  storylines; the detailed assumptions are reported in Fenhann (2000). The SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>
  emissions for the four scenarios given in Fenhann (2000) range from 7 to 25kt
  SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> in 2100. The main driver is electricity consumption, since the bulk of emissions
  originate from electric power transmission (for transformers).</p>
<p>SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> is also emitted from other minor sources, but for the purposes of this
  report it is assumed that uncertainty ranges factored into the alternative scenario
  formulations cover the emissions from these sources.</p>
