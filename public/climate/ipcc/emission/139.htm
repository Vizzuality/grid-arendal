<h3>6.3.2. Other Greenhouse Gases<a name="anc1"></a> </h3>
<p>Of the GHGs, CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> is the main contributor to anthropogenic radiative forcing
  because of changes in concentrations from pre-industrial times. According to
  Houghton <i>et al</i>. (1996) well-mixed GHGs (CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> ,CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> ,N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, and the halocarbons)
  induced additional radiative forcing of around 2.5 W/m <sup>2</sup> on a global
  and annually averaged basis. CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> accounted for 60% of the total, which indicates
  that the other GHGs are significant as well. Whereas CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions are by-and-large
  attributable to two major sources, energy consumption and land-use change, other
  emissions arise from many different sources and a large number of sectors and
  applications (e.g. see <a href="116.htm#tbl53">Table 5-3</a> in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<p>The SRES emissions scenarios also have different emissions for other GHGs and
  chemically active species such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane
  volatile organic compounds. The uncertainties that surround the emissions sources
  of these gases, and the more complex set of driving forces behind them are considerable
  and unresolved. Hence, model projections of these gases are particularly uncertain
  and the scenarios presented here are no exception. Improved inventories and
  studies linking driving forces to changing emissions in order to improve the
  representation of these gases in global and regional emission models remain
  an important future research task. Therefore, the models and approaches employed
  for the SRES analyses cannot produce unambiguous and generally approved estimates
  for different sources and world regions over a century. Despite the limited
  knowledge, at some point in time causal relationships between driving forces
  and emissions need to be crafted into the models for the sake of completeness.
  Even if new insights are generated by research specialists in certain fields
  of environmental science, and these become accepted as mainstream view, adopting
  them in the models is often far from straightforward as appropriate links to
  drivers may not be readily available in the underlying model structures. Limited
  personnel and resources imply that priorities must be assigned when deciding
  on further model development, and as a consequence the models lag behind "common
  wisdom" in certain areas. Of course, this does not necessarily limit their capabilities
  to capture major trends at a more aggregate level, which is the main purpose
  of these models.</p>
<p>Keeping the caveats above in mind, <a href="143.htm#tbl62b">Table 6-2b</a>
  (see later) shows the emissions in 2100 of all relevant direct and indirect
  GHGs for the four marker scenarios and, in brackets, the range of the other
  scenarios in the same family (or scenario groups for the A1 family). <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a> gives further detail about the full range of GHG emissions across the
  SRES scenarios. <a href="143.htm#tbl62b">Table 6- 2b</a> also compares the SRES
  scenarios emissions range to that of the IS92 scenario series (Pepper <i>et
  al</i>., 1992).</p>

<h4>6.3.2.1. Methane Emissions<a name="anc2"></a></h4>
<p>Anthropogenic CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions in the year 1990 are estimated at 375 ï¿½ 75 Mt CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>
  in the second IPCC assessment (Prather <i>et al.</i>, 1995). They arise from
  a variety of activities, dominated by biologic processes, each associated with
  considerable uncertainty. Future CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions in the scenarios depend in part
  on the consumption of fossil fuels, adjusted for assumed changes in technology
  and operational practices, but more strongly on scenario-specific, regional
  demographic and affluence developments, together with assumptions on preferred
  diets and agricultural practices. For example, it is noted in <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a> that the observed slowing of the rate of increase of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> concentrations
  in recent years might indicate that the emission factors that link emissions
  to changes in their drivers could be changing. The writing team recommends further
  research into the sources and modeling approaches to capture large uncertainties
  surrounding future CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions.</p>
<p>The resultant CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions trajectories for the four SRES markers and other
  scenarios in the four families portray complex patterns (as displayed in <a href="120.htm#fig55">Figure
  5-5</a> in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>). For example, the emissions in A2 and B2 marker scenarios
  increase throughout the whole time horizon to the year 2100. This increase is
  most pronounced in the A2 marker scenario, in which emissions reach about 900
  Mt CH<sub><small>4</small></sub> by 2100 (about a three-fold increase since 1990). The range for other
  scenarios in the A2 scenario family is between 549 and 1069 Mt CH<sub><small>4</small></sub> by 2100.
  The emissions level by 2100 for the B2 marker (600 Mt CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>) is about twice as
  high as in 1990 (310 Mt CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>) and ranges between 465 and 613 Mt CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> for the other
  scenarios of the B2 family. In the A1B and B1 marker scenarios, the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions
  level off and subsequently decline sooner or later in the 21st century. This
  phenomenon is most pronounced in the A1B marker, in which the fastest growth
  in the first few decades is followed by the steepest decline; the 2100 level
  ends up slightly below the current emission of 310 Mt CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> . The range of emissions
  in <a href="143.htm#tbl62b">Table 6-2b</a> indicate that alternative developments
  in energy technologies and resources could yield a higher range in CH<sub><small>4</small></sub> emissions
  compared to the "balanced" technology A1 scenario group. In the two fossil fuel
  intensive scenario groups (A1C and A1G, combined into the non-fossil A1FI group
  in the Summary for Policymakers of this report), CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions could reach some
  735 Mt CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> by 2100, whereas in the post-fossil A1T scenario group emissions
  are correspondingly lower (some 300 Mt CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> by 2100). Interestingly, the A1 scenarios
  generally have comparatively low CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions from non-energy sources because
  of a combination of low population growth and rapid advances in agricultural
  productivity. Hence the SRES scenarios extend the uncertainty range of the IS92
  scenario series somewhat toward lower emissions. However, both scenario sets
  indicate an upper bound of emissions of some 1000 Mt CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> by 2100.</p>
