<h1>1.2. What are Scenarios?</h1>
<p>Scenarios are images of the future, or alternative futures. They are neither
  predictions nor forecasts. Rather, each scenario is one alternative image of
  how the future might unfold. A set of scenarios assists in the understanding
  of possible future developments of complex systems. Some systems, those that
  are well understood and for which complete information is available, can be
  modeled with some certainty, as is frequently the case in the physical sciences,
  and their future states predicted. However, many physical and social systems
  are poorly understood, and information on the relevant variables is so incomplete
  that they can be appreciated only through intuition and are best communicated
  by images and stories. Prediction is not possible in such cases (see <a href="#box11">Box
  1-1</a> on uncertainties inherent in scenario analysis).</p>

      <p><b>Box 1-1:<a name="box11"></a> Uncertainties and Scenario Analysis</b></p>
      <p>In general, there are three types of uncertainty: uncertainty in quantities,
	uncertainty about model structure and uncertainties that arise from disagreements
	among experts about the value of quantities or the functional form of
	the model (Morgan and Henrion, 1990). Sources of uncertainty could be
	statistical variation, subjective judgment (systematic error), imperfect
	definition (linguistic imprecision), natural variability, disagreement
	among experts and approximation (Morgan and Henrion, 1990). Others (Funtowicz
	and Ravetz, 1990) distinguish three main sources of uncertainty: "data
	uncertainties,""modeling uncertainties" and "completeness uncertainties."
	Data uncertainties arise from the quality or appropriateness of the data
	used as inputs to models. Modeling uncertainties arise from an incomplete
	understanding of the modeled phenomena, or from approximations that are
	used in formal representation of the processes. Completeness uncertainties
	refer to all omissions due to lack of knowledge. They are, in principle,
	non-quantifiable and irreducible.</p>
      <p>Scenarios help in the assessment of future developments in complex systems
	that are either inherently unpredictable, or that have high scientific
	uncertainties. In all stages of the scenario-building process, uncertainties
	of different nature are encountered. A large uncertainty surrounds future
	emissions and the possible evolution of their underlying driving forces,
	as reflected in a wide range of future emissions paths in the literature.
	The uncertainty is further compounded in going from emissions paths to
	climate change, from climate change to possible impacts and finally from
	these driving forces to formulating adaptation and mitigation measures
	and policies. The uncertainties range from inadequate scientific understanding
	of the problems, data gaps and general lack of data to inherent uncertainties
	of future events in general. Hence the use of alternative scenarios to
	describe the range of possible future emissions.</p>
      <p>For the current SRES scenarios, the following sources of uncertainties
	are identified: <br>
	<i>Choice of Storylines</i>. Freedom in choice of qualitative scenario
	parameter combinations, such as low population combined with high gross
	domestic product (GDP), contributes to scenario uncertainty. <br>
	<i>Authors Interpretation of Storylines</i>. Uncertainty in the individual
	modeler's translation of narrative scenario storyline text in quantitative
	scenario drivers. Two kinds of parameters can be distinguished:</p>
      <ul>
	    <li>Harmonized drivers such as population, GDP, and final energy (see
	  <a href="090.htm">Section 4.1.</a> in <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Inter-scenario uncertainty
	  is reduced in the harmonized runs as the modeling teams decided to keep
	  population and GDP within certain agreed boundaries.</li>
	<li>Other assumed parameters were chosen freely by the modelers, consistent
	  with the storylines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>Translation of the Understanding of Linkages between Driving Forces
	into Quantitative Inputs for Scenario Analysis.</i> Often the understanding
	of the linkages is incomplete or qualitative only. This makes it difficult
	for modelers to implement these linkages in a consistent manner. <br>
	<i> Methodological Differences.</i></p>
      <ul>
	<li>Uncertainty induced by conceptual and structural differences in the
	  way models work (model approaches) and in the ways models are parameterized.</li>
	<li>Uncertainty in the assumptions that underlie the relationships between
	  scenario drivers and output, such as the relationship between average
	  income and diet change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>Different Sources of Data</i>. Data differ from a variety of well-acknowledged
	scientific studies, since "measurements" always provide ranges and not
	exact values. Therefore, modelers can only choose from ranges of input
	parameters for. For example:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Base year data.</li>
	<li>Historical development trajectories.</li>
	<li>Current investment requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>Inherent Uncertainties</i>. These uncertainties stem from the fact
	that unexpected "rare" events or events that a majority of researchers
	currently consider to be "rare future events" might nevertheless occur
	and produce outcomes that are fundamentally different from those produced
	by SRES model runs.</p>

<p>Scenarios can be viewed as a linking tool that integrates qualitative narratives
  or stories about the future and quantitative formulations based on formal modeling.
  As such they enhance our understanding of how systems work, behave and evolve.
  Scenarios are useful tools for scientific assessments, for learning about complex
  systems behavior and for policy making (Jefferson, 1983; Davis, 1999). In scientific
  assessments, scenarios are usually based on an internally consistent and reproducible
  set of assumptions or theories about the key relationships and driving forces
  of change, which are derived from our understanding of both history and the
  current situation. Often scenarios are formulated with the help of numeric or
  analytic formal models.</p>
<p>Future levels of global GHG emissions are the products of a very complex, ill-understood
  dynamic system, driven by forces such as population growth, socio-economic development,
  and technological progress; thus to predict emissions accurately is virtually
  impossible. However, near-term policies may have profound long-term climate
  impacts. Consequently, policy-makers need a summary of what is understood about
  possible future GHG emissions, and given the uncertainties in both emissions
  models and our understanding of key driving forces, scenarios are an appropriate
  tool for summarizing both current understanding and current uncertainties. For
  such scenarios to be useful for climate models, impact assessments and the design
  of mitigation and adaptation policies, both the main outputs of the SRES scenarios
  (emissions) and the main inputs or driving forces (population growth, economic
  growth, technological, e.g., as it affects energy and land-use) are equally
  important.</p>

<p>GHG emissions scenarios are usually based on an internally consistent and reproducible
  set of assumptions about the key relationships and driving forces of change,
  which are derived from our understanding of both history and the current situation.
  Often these scenarios are formulated with the help of formal models. Such scenarios
  specify the future emissions of GHGs in quantitative terms and, if fully documented,
  they are also reproducible. Sometimes GHG emissions scenarios are less quantitative
  and more descriptive, and in a few cases they do not involve any formal analysis
  and are expressed in qualitative terms. The SRES scenarios involve both qualitative
  and quantitative components; they have a narrative part called "storylines"
  and a number of corresponding quantitative scenarios for each storyline. <a href="#fig11">Figure
  1-1</a> illustrates the interrelated nature of these alternative scenario formulations.</p>
<p>Although no scenarios are value free, it is often useful to distinguish between
  normative and descriptive scenarios. Normative (or prescriptive) scenarios are
  explicitly values-based and teleologic, exploring the routes to desired or undesired
  endpoints (utopias or dystopias). Descriptive scenarios are evolutionary and
  open-ended, exploring paths into the future. The SRES scenarios are descriptive
  and should not be construed as desirable or undesirable in their own right.
  They are built as descriptions of possible, rather than preferred, developments.
  They represent pertinent, plausible, alternative futures. Their pertinence is
  derived from the need for policy makers and climate-change modelers to have
  a basis for assessing the implications of future possible paths for GHG and
  SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions, and the possible response strategies. Their plausibility is based
  on an extensive review of the emissions scenarios available in the literature,
  and has been tested by alternative modeling approaches, by peer review (including
  the "open process" through the IPCC web site), and by the IPCC review and approval
  processes. Good scenarios are challenging and court controversy, since not everybody
  is comfortable with every scenario, but used intelligently they allow policies
  and strategies to be designed in a more robust way.</p>
