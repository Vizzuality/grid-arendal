<h3><a name="anc2"></a>3.4.4. Energy Supply Technologies</h3>
<h4>3.4.4.1. Introduction<a name="anc3"></a></h4>
<p>The recent literature on long-term energy and emission scenarios increasingly
  emphasizes that both resource availability and technology are interrelated and
  inherently dynamic (see, e.g., IIASA-WEC, 1995; Watson <i>et al</i>. 1996; Nakicenovic
  <i>et al</i>., 1998a). The state of the art of theories and models of technological
  change is reviewed in <a href="075.htm">Section 3.4.5</a>. The literature suggests
  that models of endogenous technological change are still in their infancy, and
  that no methodologies are established that reduce the substantial uncertainties
  with respect to direction and rates of change of future technology developments.
  Differences in opinions as to the likelihood and dynamics of change in future
  technologies will therefore persist. Such future uncertainties are best captured
  by adopting a scenario approach. The following discussion on changes in energy
  supply and end-use technologies therefore reviews the literature with emphasis
  on empirically observed historical and conjectured future changes. The principal
  message is that while the future is uncertain, the certainty is that future
  technologies will be different from those used today. Hence the most unlikely
  scenario of future development is that of stagnation, or absence of change.</p>
<h4><a name="anc4"></a>3.4.4.2. Fossil and Fissile Energy Supply Technologies</h4>
<p>Fossil-fueled power stations traditionally have been designed around steam
  turbines to convert heat into electricity. Conversion efficiencies of new power
  stations can exceed 40% (on a lower heating value basis - when the latent heat
  of steam from water in the fuel or the steam arising from the hydrogen content
  of the fuel has been excluded). New designs, such as supercritical designs that
  involve new materials to allow higher steam temperatures and pressures, enable
  efficiencies of close to 50%. In the long run, further improvements might be
  expected. However, the past decade or so has seen the dramatic breakthrough
  of combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs). The technology involves expanding very
  hot combustion gases through a gas turbine with the waste heat in the exhaust
  gases used to generate steam for a steam turbine. The gas turbine can withstand
  much higher inlet temperatures than a steam turbine, which produces considerable
  increases in overall efficiency. The latest designs currently under construction
  can achieve efficiencies of over 60%, a figure that has been rising by over
  1% per year for a decade. The low capital costs and high availability of CCGTs
  also make them highly desirable to power station operators. Gregory and Rogner
  (1998) estimate that maximum efficiencies of 71 to 73% are achievable within
  a reasonable period (on a lower heating basis; around 65 to 68% on a higher
  heating basis).</p>
<p>CCGTs can also be used with more difficult fuels, such as coal and biomass,
  by adding a gasifier to the front end to form an integrated gasification combined
  cycle (IGCC) power station. The gases need to be hot cleaned prior to combustion
  to avoid energy losses and this is one of the key areas of development. The
  added benefit is that coal flue gas desulfurization (FGD) becomes unnecessary
  as sulfur is removed before the combustion stage. In addition to FGD and IGCC,
  fluidized bed combustion (FBC) technology facilitates sulfur abatement (adding
  limestone during combustion to retain sulfur) and allows the utilization of
  low quality fossil fuels because of the high sulfur retention capacity. However,
  FGD reduces overall conversion efficiencies (i.e., increases CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions).
  Also, both FGD and FBC sulfur abatement technologies use calcium carbonate to
  reduce emissions, which increases CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions because of CaO liberation from
  CaCO<sub>3</sub> capture. The use of high sulfur coals in FBC requires high limestone consumption,
  which results in increased CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions. Only IGCC reduces SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions,
  because of the higher power generation efficiency. </p>
<p>Biomass is particularly suited to gasification. Stoll and Todd (1996) and Willerboer
  (1997) estimate that current designs for coal are around 9% less efficient than
  a standard CCGT burning gas. Developments to reduce heat losses through better
  heat recovery and by hot gas cleaning could potentially increase efficiency
  significantly in the next 10 to 15 years, and the technology can yield efficiencies
  of 51% now and perhaps 65% in the longer run.</p>
<p>The major potential competitor to CCGT technology is the fuel cell, which may
  be able to offer similar efficiencies at much lower plant sizes and so may be
  an ideal candidate for distributed combined heat and power generation. Another
  promising fuel cell application is vehicle propulsion. In contrast to other
  fossil-sourced electricity generation, fuel cells (similar to batteries) convert
  the chemical energy of fuels electrochemically (i.e., without combustion) into
  electricity and heat, and thus offer considerably higher conversion efficiencies
  than internal combustion engines. In the past, high costs and durability problems
  have restricted their use to some highly specialized applications, such as electricity
  generation in space. Recent advances in fuel cell technology, however, have
  led to their commercial production and application in niche markets for distributed
  combined heat and power production (Penner <i>et al</i>., 1995).</p>
<p>Although operating internally on hydrogen, fuel cells can be fueled with a
  hydrocarbon fuel, such as natural gas, methanol, gasoline, or even coal. Before
  entering the fuel cells, these fuels would be converted on-site or on-board
  into hydrogen via steam reforming, partial oxidation, or gasification and hydrogen
  separation. In the longer run and to make fuel cells truly zero-emission devices,
  non-fossil derived pure hydrogen, supplied and stored as compressed gas, cryogenic
  liquid, metal hydrate, or other storage form, could replace hydrocarbon fuels.
  Current fuel cell conversion efficiencies (45 to 50%) have yet to approach their
  potentials; some designs report efficiencies as high as 60% electrical efficiency
  in simple systems and 74% total efficiency in hybrid fuel cell and gas combined
  cycle systems (FETC, 1997). Hydrogen production efficiencies range from 65 to
  85% for fossil-based systems, 55 to 73% for biomass-based systems, and 80% to
  close to 90% for electrolysis (Ouellette <i>et al</i>., 1995; Williams, 1998).</p>
<p>
  Nuclear power is a proven technology that provides 17% of global electricity
  supply. There is currently no consensus concerning the future role of nuclear
  power. While it stagnates in Europe and North America, it continues as a strong
  option in a number of Asian countries and countries undergoing economic reform.
  Economics and security of supply are considerations in the choice of nuclear
  power, along with its environmental trade-offs - on a full energy chain basis,
  from mining to waste disposal and decommissioning, nuclear power emits little
  GHG emissions.</p>
<p>Public opinion is opposed to the use of nuclear power in many countries because
  of concerns regarding operating safety, final disposal of high-level radioactive
  waste, and proliferation of weapon-grade fissile materials, as well as uranium
  mining and its environmental implications. These concerns, perceived or real,
  cannot be ignored if nuclear power is to regain the position of an accepted
  technology. In addition, changed market conditions call for new reactor technologies
  - smaller in scale, reduced construction periods, and improved economics with
  no compromise in safety. The industry is striving continuously to develop advanced
  reactor designs of much lower cost and with inherent safety concepts (i.e.,
  designs that make safety less dependent on specifically activated technology
  components and human performance). The latest reactor technology already prevents
  the release of fission products or health-damaging radiation to the environment
  even under highly unlikely severe accident conditions.</p>
<p>The 1998 update of the OECD cost comparison for power plants expected to be
  commercially available around 2005 reports nuclear generating cost in the range
  2.5 to 9.0 c/kWh (US cents per kilowatt-hour), depending on location, type of
  reactor, plant factor, plant life time, discount rate, and underlying fuel price
  escalation (OECD, 1998c). Reconciliation of the assumptions of the OECD report
  with those used in the IPCC WGII SAR leads to an almost identical cost range
  of 2.9 to 5.4 c/kWh, at 5% discount rate, and 7.7 c/kWh, at 10% discount rate
  (Ishitani and Johansson, 1996).</p>
<h4>3.4.4.3. Renewable Energy Technologies<a name="anc1"></a></h4>
<p>Since the birth of the modern wind power industry in the mid-1970s, it has
  seen a continuous chain of innovations and cost reductions. Christiansson (1995)
  discusses a learning curve that relates cost reductions to installed capacity.
  She notes that the experience curve for the USA indicates a progress ratio of
  0.84 (i.e., for each doubling of installed capacity, costs of new installations
  are reduced to 0.84 of the previous level). In the UK, developers have the opportunity
  to bid to supply renewable electricity to the grid under the Non-Fossil Fuel
  Obligation. In 1998, the average bid price for large wind power schemes was
  about 5 c/kWh, nearly 20% lower than in 1996 (ENDS, 1998). The bids are made
  on a full commercial cost basis and they indicate that wind energy is cheaper
  than most of its competitors for new schemes in the UK for modest increments
  of capacity. (The exception is gas-powered CCGT generation.) However, wind,
  by nature, is intermittent and back-up capacity will be required as the proportion
  of electricity provided by wind increases, which reduces its economic attractiveness.
  Large integrated electricity systems and systems that contain significant amounts
  of hydropower (especially with storage) are able to cope with the fluctuations
  in wind power best (Grubb and Meyer, 1993; Johansson <i>et al</i>., 1993).</p>
<p>Solar voltaic power is on a similar learning curve to wind, with progress ratios
  of 0.82 in the USA and 0.81 in Japan (Christiansson, 1995; Watanabe, 1997).
  Various alternative technologies are being developed and solar voltaics can
  be envisaged as providing electricity through large arrays of cells in central
  power generation, through arrays built into cladding or roofing on buildings,
  or through single arrays to meet specific purposes. In this last form, solar
  cells have already established themselves as economic and reliable power sources
  in the provision of light, clean water, and improved health services to isolated
  rural communities (WEC, 1994). Based on the principle of a learning curve, solar
  cell costs are expected to fall as capacity builds. For example, the US Department
  of Energy projects costs to fall from 38-55 c/kWh in 1995 to 3.5-5 c/kWh in
  2030 (US DOE, 1994). For another system, WEC estimates costs to fall from 13-23
  c/kWh in 1990 to 5-10 c/kWh in 2020 (WEC, 1994).</p>
<p>Biomass, particularly wood, has been the main initial source of energy as countries
  develop and remains a substantial energy source in many developing countries
  (WEC, 1994). In addition to this, byproducts of agriculture and forestry can
  be useful sources of energy. The extent to which biomass can contribute beyond
  this to provide energy crops for use in, say, power stations or for conversion
  into liquid fuels depends firstly on the competition for land with agriculture
  for food production. This, in turn, depends on improved productivity in food
  production, the amount and type of meat and other animal (e.g., dairy) products
  in the diet, and the growth in human population. The future contribution of
  biomass will also depend on increased productivity in biomass production coupled
  with limitations in energy input to grow, harvest, and use energy crops (Ishitani
  and Johansson, 1996; Leemans, 1996). Current costs of biomass (for a eucalyptus
  plantation in Uruguay) are typically put at US$1.8/GJ with projected costs of
  US$1.4/GJ and productivity at 360GJ/hectare per year (Shell International Ltd.,
  1996). Agricultural productivity is also growing at 2% per year with the prospects
  of a similar productivity gain for energy crops (Shell International Ltd., 1996).
  WEC (1994) notes that Brazil has had a program to grow sugar cane to produce
  transport fuel since the mid 1970s and that production has reached 62% of the
  country's needs; this may be one option for wider use as the availability of
  conventional oil starts to fall.</p>
<p>Finally, other forms of renewable energy, such as geothermal energy, tidal
  energy, wave energy, ocean thermal energy conversion, and solar thermal power
  plants, could make significant contributions at some stage in the future, as
  geothermal energy already does in specific markets. Also, technologies and processes
  that lead to carbon sequestration as a by-product include enhanced oil recovery
  using CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> to improve the viscosity of crude oil or reforestation for reasons
  of soil preservation (Ishitani and Johansson, 1996).</p>
<h4><a name="anc2"></a>3.4.4.4. Combined Heat and Power Production (Cogeneration)</h4>
<p>The fuel effectiveness of all energy conversion processes that involve combustion,
  but also of fuel cells, can be raised substantially by combined heat and power
  generation. Utilities located in the vicinity of urban areas may divert the
  waste heat from combustion for residential or commercial heating purposes. Industrial
  producers of high-temperature process heat may consider the generation of electricity
  when process temperature requirements are lower than the temperatures supplied.
  Combined heat and power production can accomplish fuel utilization rates of
  90% or more (Ishitani and Johansson, 1996).</p>
