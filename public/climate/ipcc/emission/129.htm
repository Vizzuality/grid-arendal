<h4>5.6.1.2. Land-Use Carbon Dioxide Emissions</h4>
<p>Changes in land use are influenced primarily by the demand for cropland and
  grassland (to supply plant and animal food to the world population) and by the
  role of biomass energy. The uncertainty of emission estimates is reflected in
  the models used to quantify the SRES scenarios - in 1990 they range between
  1.0 and 1.6 GtC and the spread at the regional level is even larger. In all
  the SRES marker scenarios, most emissions related to land use originate from
  the ASIA and ALM regions (<a href="128.htm#tbl513">Tables 5-13a</a>-<a href="128.htm#tbl513d">d</a>). In the
  industrialized regions, the land-use change emissions in 2100 vary from -0.40
  to +0.04 GtC. In the developing regions emissions from land-use change span
  a larger range (from -0.56 to +0.35 GtC).<br>

<p><b><a name="fig517"></a></b>Adding land-use CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions to the energy- and industry-related emissions
  does not make significant changes to the distribution of emissions across regions
  (<a href="128.htm#fig514">Figures 5-14</a> and <a href="128.htm#fig515">5-15</a>).
  <a href="128.htm#fig514">Table 5-14</a> provides an overview of the relative
  shares of the industrialized and developing regions within global CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions.
  On average, the SRES marker scenarios project a shift in relative contribution
  in both energy- and industry-related and total CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from the industrialized
  to developing regions. In general, the relative contribution of industrialized
  regions is the lowest in A1 and the highest in B2. </p>
<p>Shifts in the regional emission shares (<a href="128.htm#tbl513">Table 5-13a</a>-<a href="128.htm#tbl513d">d</a>)
  result from different developments in regional emission trajectories. To illustrate
  this, the trajectories were normalized to the base year (1990 = 100 for each
  region) and are presented in <a href="#fig516">Figure 5-16</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#fig516">Figure 5-16</a> confirms that CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions in the ASIA and ALM regions in all
  the SRES markers grow much faster than in the industrialized regions. It also
  illustrates that the global pattern is strongly influenced by the developing
  region trajectories. Furthermore, reflecting different development perspectives
  in the four SRES families, CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions grow differently in ASIA and ALM. In
  the A1B marker, emission trajectories in ALM and ASIA are roughly parallel over
  the entire time horizon. In the B1 marker, this is only true in the earlier
  years. As the emission of ALM peaks and then declines later than that of ASIA,
  emission trajectories diverge strongly in the second half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
  In the A2 marker, emissions in ALM start to grow at a lower rate than in ASIA,
  but subsequently catch up and later the two are again fairly close. Finally,
  in the B2 marker, ALM emissions initially grow at a modest rate, close to those
  for the OECD90 region and the world average. In later years, the growth in ALM
  exceeds the global rate, but total carbon emissions remain far below those in
  the ASIA region (<a href="128.htm#fig515">Figures 5-15</a>, <a href="#fig516">5-16</a>).</p>

<p>The resultant CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emission trajectories in the four SRES markers are displayed
  in <a href="#fig517">Figure 5-17</a>. By 2020, regional differences between the four markers are minimal.
  In 2050, the largest difference is the relative share of the REF region in the
  A2 marker, attributable primarily to an increased coal and gas production in
  this region. By 2100, the A2 marker has the largest CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions in all the
  regions as compared to the other markers (<a href="128.htm#tbl513">Tables 5-13a-d</a>,
  <a href="#fig517">Figure 5-17</a>). This arises from the "heterogeneous" nature of the A2 storyline,
  in which each region has to rely primarily on its own resources and progress
  in the renewable energy sector is quite limited. The second highest methane
  emissions are attained in the B2 marker, which also has a "regional" orientation,
  but with a more environmentally sustainable emphasis as compared to the A2 marker.
  Starting from 2100, both A1B and B1 markers have notably lower CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions
  in all the regions in comparison with the A2 and B2 markers (<a href="129.htm#fig517">Figure 5-17</a>). The
  regional emission allocation changes considerably from 1990 to 2100; all four
  markers project much greater percentages of emissions in the developing regions
  (ASIA and ALM).</p>

  N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions are 39%, 9%, 34%, and 18%, respectively (<a href="#fig518">Figure 5-18</a>). The OECD90
  emissions remain quite stable over the 21<sup>st</sup> century in all the markers, except
  A2 in which emissions increase from 2.6 MtN in 1990 to almost 4 MtN in 2100.
  Emissions in the ASIA and REF regions increase in the A2 marker, decline in
  the B1 marker (after an initial increase in ASIA), and do not change significantly
  in the A1 and B2 markers. Finally, the ALM N<sub><small>2</small></sub>O emissions grow quickly in the
  A2 marker and remain relatively flat in the other markers. The relatively small
  changes in the N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions across regions and scenarios are explained, in

<h4>5.6.1.6. Halocarbons and Other Halogenated Compounds<a name="5616"></a></h4>

  total (<a href="129.htm#fig519">Figure 5-19</a>). By 2020, OECD90 still remains a major emitter, but emissions
  in ASIA and ALM are increasing at much higher rates. The continued growth of
  the production and use of halocarbons and other halogenated compounds in the
  developing regions after 2020 makes them primary emitters of these substances
  in all the markers, except the B1 marker, in 2100 (<a href="#fig519">Figure 5-19</a>). </p>
<p>The A1B marker has the largest emissions in all the regions in 2050, while
  in 2100 the largest emissions across all the regions are produced in the A2
  marker. Emissions in all the regions are smallest in the B1 marker, which reflects
  its sustainability features (e.g., increased recycling and "dematerialization").</p>

<h4><b><a name="fig520"></a></b>5.6.1.7. Sulfur<a name="5617"></a></h4>
<p>As noted in <a href="126.htm#5521">Section 5.5.2.1</a>, even with a comparatively
  good agreement on global sulfur emission levels, important uncertainties remain
  at the sectoral and regional levels. The base-year uncertainties are especially
  important because regional sulfur emissions trends have changed drastically
  during the past decade. While declining strongly in the industrialized regions
  as a result of sulfur control policies in Europe and North America, and because
  of economic reforms in Russia and Eastern Europe, emissions increase rapidly
  in Asia with an increase in the energy demand and coal use.</p>
<p>As a general rule, in the SRES scenarios an increasing affluence causes energy
  use per capita to rise and leads to the substitution of solid fuels, such as
  coal and fuelwood, with energy forms of higher quality. This relationship determines
  the sulfur emission dynamics across the SRES markers and regions (<a href="#fig520">Figure 5-20</a>).</p>
<p>In "high income regions" (OECD90, REF) sulfur emissions have already passed
  their peaks and are actually declining at present. This trend is expected to
  continue in all the markers, except A2 in which an increased use of coal "counters"
  a decline in specific emissions in OECD90 (<a href="#fig520">Figure 5-20</a>). Emissions in ASIA grow
  in all the markers by 2020, and then decline by 2050, and further decline by
  2100. The most dramatic decline is registered in the A1B marker; this is related
  to its aggressive assumptions on the introduction of low-sulfur technologies
  and fuel switching in the ASIA region (see <a href="126.htm#box53">Box 5-3</a>
  for more details). Unlike ASIA, the ALM region sees increases in emissions in
  all four markers from 2020 to 2050, because of the somewhat "mixed" nature of
  this region, which combines countries with substantially different affluence
  levels and development trends. However, by 2100, when low-sulfur technology
  becomes widely available everywhere, emissions in the ALM decline in all markers
  (<a href="129.htm#fig520">Figure 5-20</a>).</p>

<h3>5.6.2. Gridded Sulfur Emissions<a name="562"></a></h3>
<p>As discussed above, global sulfur emissions eventually decline in all SRES
  scenario families and associated groups. In addition, the regional distribution
  of emissions changes drastically over time. While in previous decades major
  sulfur emitters were located primarily in industrialized regions of the world,
  presently emissions for these sources are declining because of the introduction
  of cleaner fuels and the conversion to low-sulfur technologies to comply with
  environmental regulations. In the majority of SRES scenarios, this trend is
  expected to continue. Meanwhile, less-developed regions are anticipated to experience
  strong economic growth associated with an increased demand for energy. Especially
  in the short term, fossil fuels are likely to satisfy the major share of this
  new demand, which may lead to a steep initial growth in sulfur emissions. As
  mentioned earlier (see <a href="126.htm">Section 5.5.2</a>), at some point in
  time sulfur emissions will be controlled in all the scenarios and, together
  with shifts to essentially sulfur-free energy resources, they will decrease
  in the developing regions as they are decreasing now in the industrialized world.
  As a consequence of these complex dynamics, different countries and regions
  are bound to experience very different levels of sulfur emissions over the 21<sup>st</sup> 
  century. To illustrate this, <a href="#fig521">Figure 5-21</a> shows gridded sulfur emissions in
  1990 and 2050 in the A1B marker (see <a href="#box55">Box 5-5</a>)</p>
