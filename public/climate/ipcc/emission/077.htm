<h3><a name="anc1"></a>3.5.2. Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Anthropogenic Land-Use Change</h3>
<p>A variety of changes in land use can result in anthropogenic CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emission or
  absorption. These changes most obviously include permanent deforestation or
  afforestation. However, many changes in land-management practices also contribute
  to CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> fluxes because of changes in standing biomass densities or in soil carbon.
  Empirical studies of such CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> fluxes are rare, so that information on current
  emissions is very poor. Whereas comprehensive information exists for forests
  globally, only a few countries have detailed information on forest and agricultural
  land-management practices. Hence, global estimates of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from anthropogenic
  land-use change, including those in the SRES, tend to be based entirely on net
  deforestation-afforestation and on average figures for carbon storage per hectare
  in forests.</p>

<p>Emissions of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> from deforestation arise mostly from the burning of trees
  and other vegetation in tropical forests cleared for agricultural use. These
  emissions also stem from the decomposition of trees harvested for lumber, the
  burning of wood for fuel, and soil respiration. If harvested wood is replaced
  by new seedlings, it is normally assumed that the amount of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> released by
  decomposition or burning is compensated by the CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> taken up during growth of
  the seedlings and, therefore, that the net emissions of harvested trees is zero.
  Where net afforestation occurs, net emissions are taken to be negative (i.e.
  afforestation acts as a sink).</p>
<p>As a consequence of inconsistencies in base-year estimates for net changes
  in forest biomass, emission estimates are normalized relative to their 1990
  value before comparison with each other (<a href="#fig314">Figure 3-14</a>).
  <a href="#fig314">Figure 3-14</a> also clearly depicts the relative change of
  emissions with time (Alcamo, <i>et al</i>., 1995; Nakicenovic <i>et al</i>.,
  1998b).</p>
<p>The scenarios of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from land-use change have quite different temporal
  paths, and show their widest range before the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (<a href="#fig314">Figure
  3-14</a>). Nearly all the scenarios then converge to very low emissions by the
  end of the century. At their widest point, the scenarios span about a factor
  of 14.</p>
<p>The different sets of scenarios can be grouped into roughly two typical paths:
  One set declines smoothly after 1990, while the other sharply increases for
  a few decades after 1990. After the middle of the 21st century most scenarios
  stabilize or continue to decline because either the driving forces of deforestation
  equilibrate or because forests are depleted. These processes are discussed further
  below. By 2100, CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> scenarios of deforestation range from zero to 30% of their
  base-year estimates.</p>
<p>As emissions from deforestation are more significant in developing regions
  than industrial regions, few scenarios of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> from deforestation are available
  for industrial regions, so the focus here is on developing regions only. For
  Asia, emissions in all but one scenario (EPA-SCW, 7-1 in <a href="076.htm#tbl37">Table
  3-7</a>) steadily decline after the base year, and reach 25% or less of their
  1990 value in 2100 (<a href="#fig314">Figure 3-14b</a>). For Africa, emissions
  first increase before eventually decreasing in 2100 to a small fraction of their
  1990 value (<a href="#fig314">Figure 3-14c</a>). In this scenario, deforestation
  rates decline in Asia and Africa because of the depletion of their forests.
  For Latin America, the wide range of scenarios reflects the wide range of views
  about its future rates of deforestation (<a href="#fig314">Figure 3-14d</a>).</p>

<p>One of the main factors that affects estimates of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> from deforestation is
  the assumed deforestation rate, which is estimated by a wide variety of methods.
  For example, the IS92a-IS92f scenarios assume that deforested area is proportional
  to population, with a time lag of 25 years, and that deforestation continues
  until 25 years after the population stabilizes or until forests are exhausted
  (Leggett <i>et al</i>., 1992). The IMAGE 2.1 emission estimates are based on
  computed changes in global land cover, which take into account changing demand
  for agricultural commodities. Trexler and Haugen (1995) compute the rate of
  tropical deforestation on a country-by- country basis, and include information
  from questionnaires. Jepma (1995) uses a combination of three models (a socio-economic
  model, a wood demand-supply model, and a land-use model), while Palo <i>et al</i>.
  (1997) correlate deforestation rates with income levels. To further confound
  this situation, the factors that affect deforestation vary greatly from place
  to place, and therefore need to be defined as locally as possible.</p>
<p><a href="077.htm#fig315">Figure 3-15</a> presents population assumptions of
  various deforestation scenarios, together with the assumed or implied deforestation
  rates on a per capita basis. The shape of the emission curves (<a href="#fig314">Fig.
  3-14</a>) follows the shape of the deforestation rate curves, rather than that
  of the population assumptions. However, the range of emissions is much larger
  than the range of deforestation rates. Some conclusions can be drawn from these
  data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When given on a per capita basis, the range of deforestation rates is perhaps
    not as great as expected (about a factor of eight) considering the wide range
    of assumptions and methods used to estimate these rates.</li>
  <li>The temporal trend of emissions arises from the temporal trend of deforestation
    estimates.</li>
  <li>The range of emissions is strongly, but not only, influenced by the deforestation
    rates, and at its widest (a factor 14) can be better explained by the combined
    range of per capita deforestation rates, population, and carbon density.</li>
</ul>
<p>The role that assumed carbon density of vegetation plays in the estimation
  of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions must be considered. To estimate CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions, it is necessary
  to estimate the carbon density of vegetation that is burned and decayed when
  forests are cleared. However, there is wide disagreement in the literature as
  to typical values of carbon density because of both the many methods used to
  measure density and the wide variation in the mix of tropical forest vegetation.</p>
