<h4>3.4.2.4. Transport<a name="anc1"></a></h4>
<p>The transport sector consumed slightly over 63 EJ, or about 20% of global primary
  energy, in 1990. Transport sector primary energy use grew at a relatively rapid
  average annual rate of 2.8% between 1971 and 1990, slowing to 1.7% per year
  between 1990 and 1995. Industrialized countries clearly dominate energy consumption
  in this sector, using 62% of the world's transport energy in 1990, followed
  by REF (16%), ALM (12%), and ASIA (10%) regions. The most rapid growth was seen
  in the ASIA countries (5.9% per year) and the ALM region (4.6% per year). Transport
  energy use dropped dramatically in the REF region after 1990; by 1995 this region
  only consumed 11% of global transport energy use. Growth in transport primary
  energy use also declined slightly in the IND region, dropping from an average
  of 2.2% per year between 1971 and 1990 to 1.9% per year between 1990 and 1995.
  High growth continued in the ASIA and ALM regions, with the ASIA countries increasing
  to an average of 7.6% per year between 1990 and 1995 (BP, 1997; IEA, 1997a;
  IEA, 1997b).</p>
<p>Influences on GHG emissions from the transport sector are often divided into
  those that affect activity levels (travel and freight movements) and those that
  affect technology (energy efficiency, carbon intensity of fuel, emission factors
  for nitrous oxide (N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O), etc.). The various driving forces and their effects
  are reviewed in detail in the IPCC Working Group II (WGII) Second Assessment
  Report (SAR) (Michaelis <i>et al</i>., 1996).</p>
<p>In aggregate, transport patterns are closely related to economic activity,
  infrastructure, settlement patterns, and prices of fuels and vehicles. They
  are also related to communication links. At the household level, travel is affected
  by transport costs, income, household size, local settlement patterns, the occupation
  of the head of the household, household make-up, and location (Jansson, 1989;
  Hensher <i>et al</i>., 1990; Walls <i>et al</i>., 1993). People in higher-skilled
  occupations that require higher levels of education are more price- and income-responsive
  in their transport energy demand than people in lower-skilled occupations (Greening
  and Jeng, 1994; Greening <i>et al</i>., 1994).</p>
<p>Urban layout both affects and is affected by the predominant transport systems.
  It is also strongly influenced by other factors such as people's preference
  for living in low-density areas, close to parks or other green spaces, away
  from industry, and close to schools and other services. Travel patterns may
  be influenced by many factors, including the size of the settlements, proximity
  to other settlements, location of workplaces, provision of local facilities,
  and car ownership. A survey of cities around the world (Newman and Kenworthy,
  1990) found that population density strongly and inversely correlates with transport
  energy use.</p>
<p>Many studies have examined the response of car travel and gasoline demand to
  gasoline price, and are reviewed, for example, in Michaelis (1996) and Michaelis
  <i>et al</i>. (1996). Such studies typically find a measurable reduction in
  fuel demand, distance traveled, car sales, and energy intensity in response
  to fuel price increases. Studies of freight transport found relatively small
  short-term impacts of diesel price increases, and often produced results that
  were inconclusive or statistically insignificant. Over the longer term, price
  responsiveness is generally assumed to be larger because of possible technology
  responses.</p>
<p>An important influence on future travel may be the development of telecommunication
  technologies. In some instances, improved communication can substitute for travel
  as people can work at home or shop via the internet. In others, communication
  can help to increase travel by enabling friendships and working relationships
  to develop over long distances, and by permitting people to stay in touch with
  their homes and offices while traveling. To the extent that improvements in
  telecommunication technology stimulate the economy, they are likely to result
  in increased freight transport.</p>
<p>
  Energy intensity in the transport sector is measured as energy used per passenger-km
  for passenger transport and per ton-km for freight transport. Transport energy
  projections typically incorporate a reduction in fleet energy intensity in the
  range 0.5 to 2% per year (Grï¿½bler <i>et al</i>., 1993b; IEA, 1993; Walsh, 1993).
  On-road energy intensity (fuel consumption per kilometer driven) of light-duty
  passenger vehicles in North America fell by nearly 2% per year between 1970
  and 1990, to about 13 to 14 liters per 100 kilometers, but it is now stationary
  or rising. In other industrialized countries, changes in on-road fuel consumption
  from 1970 to the present were quite small. The average on-road energy intensity
  in North America was 85% higher than that in Europe in 1970, but only 25 to
  30% higher by the mid-1990s (Schipper, 1996).</p>
<p>In some countries, such as Italy and France, where fleet average energy intensity
  has fallen during the past 20 years, the energy intensity of car travel (MJ/passenger-km)
  has increased as a result of declining car occupancy and the increasing use
  of more efficient diesel vehicles (Schipper <i>et al</i>., 1993). However, conversion
  to diesel has been encouraged by low duties on diesel fuel relative to those
  on gasoline. The lower costs of driving diesel vehicles may have acted as a
  significant stimulus to travel by diesel car owners, and so offset much of the
  energy saved from their high-energy efficiency. A more recent trend, though,
  is toward higher energy intensity in new cars in countries such as the US, Germany,
  and Japan (IEA, 1993). Factors in the recent increases in energy intensity include
  the trend toward larger cars, increasing engine size, and the use of increasingly
  power-hungry accessories (Martin and Shock, 1989; Difiglio <i>et al</i>., 1990;
  Greene and Duleep, 1993; IEA, 1993).</p>
<p>Average truck energy use per ton-km of freight moved has shown little sign
  of reduction during the past 20 years in countries for which data are available
  (Schipper <i>et al</i>., 1993). Energy use is typically in the region 0.7 to
  1.4 MJ/ton-km for the heaviest trucks but can be in excess of 5 MJ/ton-km for
  smaller trucks. In countries where services and light industry are growing faster
  than heavy industry, the share of small trucks or vans in road freight is increasing.
  Along with the increasing power-to-weight ratios of goods vehicles, these trends
  offset, and in some cases outweigh, the benefits of improved engine and vehicle
  technology (Delsey, 1991). Energy intensity tends to be lower in countries with
  large heavy-industry sectors, because a high proportion of goods traffic is
  made up of bulk materials or primary commodities.</p>
<p>Air traffic grew about three times as fast as GDP in the early 1970s, but only
  about twice as fast since the early 1980s. After allowing for the effects of
  continually falling prices, the elasticity of the 10-year average growth rate
  with respect to the 10-year average GDP growth is not much more than 1.0 (Michaelis,
  1997a). Over the 30 years to 1990, the average energy intensity of the civil
  aircraft fleet fell by about 2.7% per year. The fastest reduction, of about
  4% per year, was in the period 1974 to 1988. The large reductions in energy
  intensity during the 1970s and 1980s resulted partly from developments in the
  technology used for new aircraft in the rapidly expanding civil aircraft fleet
  and partly from increases in aircraft load factor (passengers per seat or percentage
  of cargo capacity filled). The aircraft weight load factor increased from 49%
  in 1972 to 59% in 1990, but nearly all of this rise occurred during the 1970s
  (ICAO, 1995a, 1995b).</p>
<p>Transport sector carbon intensities for personal travel, measured as the ratio
  of emissions to passenger-km traveled, increased in most European countries
  and Japan between 1972 and 1994. This increase resulted from falling load factors
  (persons per vehicle), which were greater than improvements in vehicle energy
  intensity. The only exception among industrialized countries was the US, where
  carbon intensities dropped from 55 kgC/passenger-km in 1972 to 46 kgC/passenger-km
  in 1994 (IEA, 1997c; Schipper <i>et al</i>., 1997a). Carbon intensity of freight
  travel, measured as the ratio of emissions to ton-km transported, rose slightly
  in a number of industrialized countries between 1972 and 1994, mostly because
  of modal shifts to more carbon-intensive trucks (Schipper <i>et al</i>., 1997b).
  As mobility increases in developing countries, transport emissions could rise
  dramatically. Ramanathan and Parikh (1999) indicate passenger traffic growth
  at 8% per year and train traffic growth at 5% per year for India. They found
  that efficiency improvements could reduce future energy demand by 26%. If, in
  addition, the modal split changes in favor of public transport modes, these
  authors estimate a 45% reduction in energy demand (Ramanathan and Parikh, 1999).</p>
<p>Fuels used to power transport are typically oil-based, except for rail, for
  which shifts toward electrified systems can lower carbon intensities depending
  upon the source of fuel for electricity generation in the country. In France,
  for example, the move toward electrified rail based on electricity generated
  by nuclear power led to lower carbon intensities (IEA, 1997c). Increased use
  of diesel engines can reduce CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions, but leads to greater emissions of
  other gaseous pollutants, such as N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O and carbon monoxide (CO). Use of alternative
  fuels, such as compressed natural gas, LPG, and ethanol, can significantly reduce
  CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from transport (IEA, 1995).</p>
