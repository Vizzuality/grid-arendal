<h3><a name="anc1"></a>3.2.6. Conclusions</h3>
<p>From the available population projections, only those from the UN and IIASA
  fulfill the characteristics needed for use in long-term emission scenarios.
  First, the UN and IIASA data are published and available in the public domain,
  and second (more importantly) the scenarios consider uncertainty by developing
  more than just one, central demographic projection.</p>
<p>We use the medium UN projections in the SRES emissions scenarios because they
  have greater recognition internationally, and garner considerable attention
  as evident from the press focus devoted to the 1996 Revision (mentioned above).
  In addition, the UN assumption of replacement-level fertility in the long term,
  in contrast to the IIASA below-replacement assumption, is an important normative
  approach widely used heretofore in projections.</p>
<p>The rapid and slow demographic transition variants from IIASA projections remain
  attractive as the "high" and "low" population variants to be considered for
  the new IPCC emissions scenarios. The incorporation of a correlation between
  mortality rates and fertility (Lutz, 1996) is a logical first-order relationship
  not used in previous population variants and, in particular, not a feature of
  the UN variants. The two IIASA variants also represent well the uncertainty
  range as spanned by the probabilistic projections of Lutz et al. (1997), which
  represent an important methodological advance in the field. As shown in <a href="052.htm#fig32">Figure
  3-2</a>, the resultant IIASA population range falls within the range of the
  UN projections.</p>

	  the four SRES scenario families (A1, A2, B1 and B2) is also shown. Generally,
	  the new range is narrower and has significantly lower medium and high

<p>Based on the above recommendations, <a href="#fig38">Figure 3-8</a> compares
  the older IS92 population range with the population range described in this
  section. The population projections in IS92 scenarios comprise the UN 1992 medium-high
  and medium-low variants for the high and low ranges with the World Bank 1991
  projection as the central case. As seen in <a href="#fig38">Figure 3-8</a>,
  the new range for SRES is somewhat narrower and lower than the IS92 range. The
  cause is partly the positive correlation between mortality rates and fertility
  rates within the IIASA variants, which mildly offset each other in terms of
  future population size. Another reason is the recent downward revision of the
  UN medium projection compared to earlier UN scenarios (as outlined above).</p>
<p>The literature suggests a general inverse correlation between economic growth
  rates and population growth rates. Higher economic growth rates in developing
  countries should correlate with lower population growth rates in long-term scenarios
  and vice versa, because of the importance of economic development in bringing
  about the demographic fertility transition. This represents a distinctive change
  from the IS92 trajectories. Importantly, there is still no quantitative basis
  for associating any particular economic growth curve with a <i>particular </i>population
  curve; this is a qualitative negative correlation only. Even more important
  is that income is not necessarily the best predictor of future fertility rates
  and many countries are currently moving through the demographic transition without
  a clear economic cause. Alternatively, some countries have failed to begin a
  fertility decline even though economic and social conditions have improved (e.g.,
  Sathar and Casterline, 1998).</p>
<p>The inclusion of a household demographic unit, in addition to population, should
  be encouraged in future studies. The effect is linked to a strongly predicted
  demographic trend - aging. Also important are that smaller households are more
  energy intensive, per person, and that aging may continue to increase more rapidly
  than population in the future. These factors may increase CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions (MacKellar
  <i>et al</i>., 1995), although senior citizens group-living is a tendency in
  some industrialized countries. Urbanization might also have a strong effect
  on emissions because of its effect on income distribution and thus energy consumption
  patterns around the world, although many of these effects are included implicitly
  in the models and parameters used in this report.</p>
