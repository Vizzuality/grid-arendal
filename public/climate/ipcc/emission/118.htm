<p>The strong trend toward ecologically more compatible consumption and production
  patterns in the B1 family is reflected by structural changes toward less energy-
  and material-intensive activities, which lead to a partial de-coupling of welfare
  and energy demands. In the B1 marker scenario (B1-IMAGE; de Vries et al., 2000)
  the rapid technological change toward resource saving and ecologically sound
  solutions is assumed to spread very quickly, facilitated by high capital stock
  turnover rates in currently less developed regions. As a result, energy requirements
  in B1-IMAGE increase slowly and a shift away from fossil fuels eventually breaks
  the already slow upward trend in carbon emissions (<a href="118.htm#fig53c">Figure
  5-3c</a>). Emissions peak around 2040 at 12 GtC, twice the 1990 level, and by
  2100 the emissions fall below the base-year level to 5 GtC. Total cumulative
  carbon emissions in the B1-IMAGE scenario amount to 983 GtC by 2100. As for
  A1, the population projection adopted for this scenario family declines after
  2050.</p>
<p>Rates of energy-intensity improvement in the first half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century
  range quite widely in B1 family scenarios, and lead to emission levels from
  8.5 (B1T-MESSAGE) to 17.5 (B1- ASF) GtC in 2050. By 2100 the gap in annual emissions
  narrows again, with final emissions between 3 and 8 GtC in all the B1 scenarios
  (except B1-High-MiniCAM).</p>
<p>The B1 family also includes one scenario in which energy-related emissions
  continue to increase throughout the modeling period, B1-High-MiniCAM. In this
  scenario the final energy demand is assumed to rise more rapidly with increasing
  income than in the rest of the B1 scenarios. (The total carbon emissions in
  B1High-MiniCAM decline slightly later in the modeling period because of reduced
  land under management and associated carbon sequestration.)</p>
<p>Total cumulative carbon emissions in the B1 scenario group ranges between 770
  and 1390 GtC by 2100. All but two B1 scenarios fall in the low cumulative emissions
  category (<a href="115.htm#tbl52">Table 5-2</a>).</p>

<p>In the B2 world, dynamics of technological change continue along historical
  trends ("dynamics as usual"). The exploitation of comparative regional advantages
  in energy resources and technologies leads to regionally different mixes of
  clean fossil and non-fossil supply. With the continued growth of population
  and of income per capita, a steady increase of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions emerges in the
  B2 marker (Riahi and Roehrl, 2000), developed using the MESSAGE model (B2-MESSAGE).
  By 2050 emissions reach 11 GtC and by 2100 they reach 14 GtC (<a href="#fig53d">Figure 5-3d</a>).
  Total cumulative CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions in the B2 marker scenario amount to 1160 GtC
  by 2100.</p>
<p>Emissions in the B2 scenarios with harmonized global input assumptions (population,
  GDP, final energy; B2-MESSAGE, B2-AIM, B2-MARIA) are very close in 2100. Differences
  in emissions are largest around 2050, which reflects the different patterns
  of structural change in the energy systems in anticipation of depletion of conventional
  oil and gas. The emissions range for non-harmonized scenarios in the B2 scenario
  group is larger - between 11.2 (B2-IMAGE<a href="fn6.htm#6" onClick="showFootnote(6,6); return false;"><sup>6</sup></a>)
  and 15.4 (B2-ASF) GtC by 2050. Relatively high emissions in the B2- ASF scenario
  are explained by a large share of coal in the fuel mix, because of high oil
  and gas prices. In this scenario, coal is also widely used for synthetic liquid
  and gaseous fuel production. In 2100, B2-IMAGE emissions (9 GtC) drop below
  the B2 marker level, while in B2-ASF emissions continue to grow and reach 19
  GtC by 2100. The B2 high scenario variant developed using MiniCAM assumes far
  less efficiency gains, smaller available resources of oil and gas, and less
  favorable development of solar power costs than in the B2 marker. As in B2-ASF,
  the near exhaustion of oil supplies in B2High-MiniCAM leads to a heavy reliance
  on synthetic fuels to supply the needs of the transportation sector. Emissions
  in this scenario increase to 23 GtC by 2100. An additional alternative with
  more coal use (B2C-MARIA) was explored using the MARIA model. Emissions in this
  scenario are considerably higher than in the original B2-MARIA case, but are
  very close to those of B2-ASF (19 GtC).</p>
<p>Total cumulative carbon emissions across the B2 scenario group range between
  1164 and 1686 GtC by 2100. Three of the eight B2 family scenarios fall into
  the "medium-high" cumulative emissions category, and the five others fall into
  the "medium-low" category (<a href="115.htm#tbl52">Table 5-2</a>).</p>
<h4>5.3.1.5. Inter-family Comparison<a name="5315"></a></h4>
<p><a href="115.htm#tbl52">Table 5-2</a> suggests fairly strong contrasts in the
  level of cumulative emissions across the four scenario families (note that estimates
  in <a href="115.htm#tbl52">Table 5-2</a> also include emissions from land use).
  A variety of available energy supply and demand options means that cumulative
  emissions in the A1 family span the entire set of emission categories. The A2
  family scenarios, characterized by a large population and a relatively carbon-intensive
  energy system, fall into either the "high" scenario category or in the upper
  part of the "medium-high" category. Only the A2-A1-MiniCAM scenario falls in
  the "medium-low" category, because of low cumulative emissions prior to 2050.
  As a consequence of the low energy consumption and non-fossil energy systems
  associated with its sustainable development theme, the B1 family scenarios are
  concentrated in the "low" emissions category. Finally, representatives of the
  B2 family are present in the two middle categories.</p>
<p>In addition to their cumulative emissions, the scenario families are characterized
  by very different emissions trajectories. The A1 fossil fuel scenarios have
  continuously increasing emissions, with rapid growth before 2050 and slower
  growth thereafter. The A1 scenarios with the "balanced" energy mix (e.g. the
  marker A1B-AIM) typically have emissions that decline after 2050, while the
  A1T technology scenarios have slower growth prior to 2050, and a steeper decline
  after 2050. As for the A1 fossil fuel scenarios, A2 family scenarios are characterized
  by high rates of growth in emissions prior to 2050 and subsequently continued
  growth but at lower rates. Unlike the rest of the A2 scenarios, the A2-A1-MiniCAM
  has more rapid growth in emissions after 2050 than before 2050, because per
  capita incomes in a number of developing regions do not reach a level at which
  per capita energy demands rise rapidly until the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
  The B1 family is characterized by lower growth in emissions prior to 2050, mostly
  because of lower rates of growth in energy demand, followed by declining emissions
  after 2050. Finally, the B2 family is characterized by relatively stable emissions
  post-2050, after roughly doubling emissions between 1990 and 2050.</p>
<h3>5.3.2. Land-Use Carbon Dioxide Emissions<a name="532"></a></h3>
<p>Most changes in land use are induced by the demand for cropland and grassland,
  which is driven by the demand for food products, the extent of biomass energy
  use, and policies and practices associated with forest management. The 1990
  land-use CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions remain fairly uncertain, estimated at 1.6 ± 1.0 GtC (Watson
  et al., 1996a); a similar level of uncertainty is attached to current land-use
  emissions. This uncertainty is reflected by the quantification of the SRES storylines
  - the 1990 emission estimates from different models range between 1.0 and 1.6
  GtC, while the spread of estimates at the four-region level is even larger.
  For the sake of comparability, common, standardized (see <a href="115.htm#box51">Box
  5-1</a> on standardization) emissions are established at 1.1 GtC in 1990 and
  1.0 GtC in 2000, to reflect the net carbon flux from contemporary changes in
  forest cover.</p>
<p>Generally, the SRES models use different approaches to estimate land-use change
  emissions - in some cases the only source of emissions is tropical deforestation,
  while in other cases more sources and sinks (including natural) are included<a href="fn6.htm#7" onClick="showFootnote(6,7); return false;"><sup>7</sup></a>
  Moreover, methodologic differences and uncertainties in carbon content, carbon
  cycling, and land classification result in seemingly inconsistent results between
  models that cover the same land-use sources. These features complicate a straightforward
  comparison between land-use emissions in scenarios generated by different SRES
  models.</p>

<p>Future trajectories of land-use CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions are shown in <a href="118.htm#fig54">Figure 5-4</a>. Emissions
  in the 40 SRES scenarios range widely in the same year and change significantly
  over time. In scenarios with continued deforestation, emissions rise initially,
  then reach a maximum, and finally decline with depletion of forestland that
  can be cleared. At the other end of the scenario spectrum, emissions turn negative
  and land-use changes become an increasing CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> sink through afforestation. By
  2020, the resultant uncertainty ranges between 0 and 3 GtC across all 40 SRES
  scenarios with a median of 1.1 GtC. By 2050, the scenario range shifts to between
  -0.7 and 1.2 GtC (median, 0.5 GtC). By 2100 the scenario range lies between
  -2.8 and 2.2 GtC, with a median of 0.0 GtC. Interestingly, in specific years
  (e.g., in 2050) scenarios from all four SRES families fall within a relatively
  narrow emissions corridor (i.e. at least one scenario from each of the four
  SRES scenario families falls within the 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the emission
  range). This indicates that similar levels of carbon fluxes related to land
  use could arise from widely different socio-economic driving forces, depending
  on future trends in food demand and dietary patterns, agricultural productivity
  growth, forest practices, etc.</p>
<p>In general, the SRES CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> land-use emissions follow the same pattern as found
  in the literature (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>) - initially emissions
  increase because of continuing deforestation in developing regions and subsequently
  they decrease following a drop in population growth and increases in agricultural
  productivity. The main difference between the SRES scenarios and the literature
  reviewed in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a> lies in the maximum emission values,
  which are significantly lower in the SRES scenarios. Possibly this arises because
  the SRES models explicitly simulate land-use change as a function of pressure
  on the land (itself a function of agricultural productivity), while in the literature
  land-use CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emission scenarios are often based on trend extrapolation or statistical
  relationships (e.g. with population growth). The rapid economic development
  and technological advances assumed in the SRES storylines thus tend to mitigate
  CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions from deforestation, and in some cases lead to their reversal (e.g.,
  turning deforested lands into carbon sinks).</p>
<p>As suggested by <a href="#fig54">Figure 5-4</a>, no simple relation exists between the scenario
  families and land-use emissions. As in the case of energy-related emissions,
  the A1 family scenarios cover the widest range of emissions and trajectories.
  In most cases, emissions in these scenarios decline after 2030 to zero or negative
  (carbon sinks) values. However, in two scenarios (A1B-IMAGE and A1B-MARIA),
  emissions increase later in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, reflecting assumptions on additional
  land pressures. As a rule, scenarios of the A2 family follow the same convex
  trajectory as A1 scenarios, also with two exceptions (A2-IMAGE and A2-AIM).
  In accordance with the sustainability emphasis of the B1 family storyline, scenarios
  from this family have the lowest initial emissions, which by 2080 or earlier
  drop to zero or negative levels. The B1 family marker scenario (B1-IMAGE) has
  negative land-use emissions for most of the modeling period, a property directly
  related to B1's "environmental conservation" emphasis.</p>
<h3>5.3.3. Overview of Sectoral Carbon Dioxide Emissions<a name="533"></a></h3>
<p>As a result of different model specifications and detail, it is not possible
  to draw up consistent comparisons between sectoral emissions across different
  models. An overview of sectoral CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions by sector and source category
  is summarized in <a href="118.htm#box52">Box 5-2</a> on the basis of the results
  of the MESSAGE (for energy and industrial sources) and AIM (for land-use change
  sources) models.</p>
<b><a name="box52"></a></b>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" >
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>Box 5-2: CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> Emissions by Sector and Source for
	MESSAGE Scenarios </b></p>
      <p><a href="118.htm#tbl54">Table 5-4</a> gives an overview of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions by sector and source category
	according to the IPCC reporting format given in Watson et al. (1996b).
	The differences in sectoral detail across models mean a consistent comparison
	and sectoral CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emission balances are only possible within one particular
	modeling framework. <a href="118.htm#tbl54">Table 5-4</a> presents the scenario results as calculated
	with the MESSAGE model for 1990, 2050, and 2100 and for the four scenario
	families and their scenario groups. Emissions related to land-use change
	were derived from consistent model runs with the AIM model. </p>
      <p>As in Watson et al. (1996b), emissions are presented by sector, and emission
	categories adopt both supply and demand perspectives for energy-related
	CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions. The supply side CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> balance accounts emissions at the point
	of energy combustion, that is at a coal-fired power plant (electric generation)
	or by burning coal in industrial boilers (direct fuel use by industry).
	Conversely, the demand side CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> balance accounts emissions per end-use
	category, irrespective of whether emissions originate directly at the
	point of end-use or upstream in the energy conversion sector. For example,
	for residential and commercial energy uses, CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions include those
	from direct fuel combustion as well as those emissions that originate
	from the generation of electricity consumed by the residential and commercial
	sectors. Finally, an emissions balance by source category is given, in
	which emissions are accounted for at the level of primary energy (solids,
	liquids, and gases), again after Watson et al. (1996b). Non-energy emissions
	are included in a separate "others" category. Combined, these different
	emission balances can serve as data input for subsequent mitigation analyses
	at the sectoral level or at that of the entire economy.<br>
