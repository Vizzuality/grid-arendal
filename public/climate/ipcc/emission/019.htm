<h1><a name="anc1"></a>9.4. Other Chemically Active Gases</h1>
<p>The SRES emissions scenarios also have different emissions for other GHGs and
  chemically active species such as CO, NO<sub>x</sub> , and volatile organic compounds.
  The uncertainties that surround the emissions sources of these gases, and the
  more complex set of driving forces behind them are considerable and unresolved.
  Hence, model projections of these gases are particularly uncertain and the scenarios
  presented here are no exception. Improved inventories and studies linking driving
  forces to changing emissions in order to improve the representation of these
  gases in global and regional emission models remain an important future research
  task.</p>
<p>The emissions of other gases follow dynamic patterns much like those shown
  in <a href="016.htm#figts7">Figure TS-7</a> for carbon dioxide emissions. Further details about GHG emissions
  are given in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="anc2"></a>9.4.1. Nitrogen Oxides Emissions</h3>
<p>Some models of the six SRES models do not provide a comprehensive description
  of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions or include only specific sectors (e.g., energy-related sources)
  and have adopted other source categories from corresponding model runs derived
  from other models. Even with a simplified model representation, future NO<sub>x</sub> emission
  levels are mainly determined by two set of variables: levels of fossil energy
  use (see <a href="089.htm">Chapter 4</a>), and level and timing of emission
  controls, inspired by local air quality concerns.</p>
<p>As a result the spread of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions is largest within the A1 scenario family
  (28 to 151 MtN/yr by 2100), almost as large as the range across all 40 SRES
  scenarios (see <a href="021.htm#tblts4a">Table TS-4</a>). Only in the highest
  emission scenarios (the fossil fuel intensive scenarios within the A1 scenario
  family and the high population, coal intensive A2 scenario family) do emissions
  rise continuously throughout the 21<sup>st</sup> century. In the A1B ("balanced") scenario
  group and in the B2 scenario family, NO<sub>x</sub> emission levels rise less. NO<sub>x</sub> emissions
  tend to increase up to 2050 and stabilize thereafter, the result of a gradual
  substitution of fossil fuels by alternatives as well as of the increasing diffusion
  of NO<sub>x</sub> control technologies. Low emission futures are described by various B1
  family scenarios, as well as in the A1T scenario group, that describe futures
  in which NO<sub>x</sub> emissions are controlled because of either local air quality concerns
  or rapid technological change away from conventional fossil technologies. Overall,
  the SRES scenarios describe a similar upper range of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions as the previous
  IS92 scenarios (151 MtN versus 134 MtN, respectively, by 2100), but extend the
  IS92 uncertainty range toward lower emission levels (16 versus 54 MtN by 2100
  in the SRES and IS92 scenarios, respectively).</p>
<h3><a name="anc3"></a>9.4.2. Volatile Organic Compounds, Excluding Methane</h3>
<p>NMVOCs arise from fossil fuel combustion (as with NO<sub>x</sub> , wide ranges of emission
  factors are typical for internal combustion engines), and also from industrial
  processes, fuel storage (fugitive emissions), use of solvents (e.g., in paint
  and cleaners), and a variety of other activities. In this report NMVOCs are
  discussed as one group. As for NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, not all models include the NMVOCs
  emissions category or all of its sources.</p>
<p>A relatively robust trend across all 40 scenarios (see <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>) is a gradual
  increase in NMVOC emissions up to about 2050, with a range between 190 and 260
  Mt. Beyond 2050, uncertainties increase with respect to both emission levels
  and trends. By 2100, the range is between 58 and 552 Mt, which extends the IS92
  scenario range of 136 to 403 Mt by 2100 toward both higher and lower emissions
  (see <a href="021.htm#tblts4a">Table TS-4</a>). As for NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, the upper
  bounds of NMVOC emissions are formed by the fossil fuel intensive scenarios
  within the A1 scenario family, and the lower bounds by the scenarios within
  the B1 scenario family. Characteristic ranges are between 60 and 90 Mt NMVOC
  by 2100 in the low emissions cluster and between 370 and 550 Mt NMVOC in the
  high emissions cluster. All other scenario families and individual scenarios
  fall between these two emissions clusters; the B2 marker scenario (B2-MESSAGE)
  closely tracks the median of global NMVOC emissions from all the SRES scenarios
  (see <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<h3><a name="anc4"></a>9.4.3. Carbon Monoxide Emissions</h3>
<p>The same caveats as stated above for NO<sub>x</sub> and NMVOC emissions also apply to
  CO emissions - the number of models that represent all the emission source categories
  is limited and modeling and data uncertainties, such as emission factors, are
  considerable. As a result, CO emission estimates across scenarios are highly
  model specific and future emission levels overlap considerably between the four
  SRES scenario families (see <a href="021.htm#tblts4a">Table TS-4</a>). Generally,
  emissions are highest in the high growth fossil fuel intensive scenarios within
  the A1 scenario family. Lowest emission levels are generally associated with
  the B1 and B2 scenario families. By 2100, emissions range between 363 and 3766
  Mt CO, a considerably larger uncertainty range, particularly toward higher emissions,
  than in IS92, for which the 2100 emission range was between 450 and 929 Mt CO
  (see <a href="021.htm#tblts4a">Table TS-4</a>).</p>
<h1><a name="anc5"></a>9.5. Emissions Overview</h1>
<p><a href="021.htm#tblts4a">Table TS-4</a> (see later) summarizes the emissions
  of GHGs, sulfur dioxide and other radiatively active species by 2100 for the
  four markers and the ranges for other 36 scenarios. Combined with Tables <a href="021.htm#tblts2a">TS-2</a>
  and <a href="021.htm#tblts3a">TS-3</a>, the tables provide a concise summary
  of the new SRES scenarios. Data are given for both the harmonized and all scenarios.</p>
