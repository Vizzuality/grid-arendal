<h3><a name="anc1"></a>3.6.6. Halocarbons and Other Industrial Gases</h3>
<p>This category of GHG emissions comprises a wide basket of different gas species
  that originate from a multitude of processes. Generally, their common characteristic
  is that they are released into the atmosphere in comparatively small amounts,
  but on a molecular basis most of the gases are long-lived, with atmospheric
  lifetimes up to 50,000 years. Generally they have a strong greenhouse forcing
  per molecule (see <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="123.htm#tbl57">Table 5-7</a>).</p>
<p>Anthropogenic emissions of gases that cause stratospheric ozone depletion (chlorofluorocarbons
  (CFCs), hydrochloro-fluorocarbons (HCFCs), halons, methylchloroform, carbon
  tetrachloride, and methylbromide) are controlled by consumption restrictions
  (production plus imports minus exports) in the Montreal Protocol. No special
  SRES scenarios were developed for these gases because their future emission
  levels (phase out) are primarily policy driven and hence unrelated to scenario
  variations of important driving-force variables such as population, economic
  growth, or industrial output. Instead, the Montreal Protocol scenario (A3, maximum
  allowed production scenario) from the 1998 WMO/UNEP <i>Scientific Assessment
  of Ozone Depletion</i> is used (WMO/UNEP, 1998).</p>
<p>The procedures for constructing scenarios for hydro-fluorocarbon (HFC), polyfluorocarbon
  (PFC), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>) emissions - for which there is an extreme
  paucity of scenario literature - are based on Fenhann (2000) and are described
  in greater detail in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="118.htm#533">Section 5.3.3</a>. In
  this approach, future total demand for CFCs, HFCs, and other CFC substitutes
  is estimated on the basis of historical trends. HFC emissions are calculated
  using an assumed future replacement of CFCs by HFCs and other substitutes. The
  main drivers for the emissions are population and GDP growth. The sparse literature
  available (reviewed in Fenhann, 2000) indicates that emissions are related non-linearly
  to these driving forces, with important possibilities for saturation effects
  and long-term decoupling between growth in driving force variables and emissions.
  The emissions have been tuned to agree with emissions scenarios presented at
  the joint IPCC-TEAP expert meeting (WMO/UNEP, 1999). Material from the March
  Consulting Group (1999) has also been used.</p>
<p>For PFCs (CF<small><sub>4</sub></small> and C<small><sub>2</sub></small>F<small><sub>6</sub></small>) the emissions driver is primary aluminum production,
  which is generally modeled using GDP and a consumption elasticity. Recycling
  rates are increasingly important, as reflected in the SRES scenarios (see <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a>). Aluminum production by the Soederberg process resulted, on average,
  in the emission of 0.45 kg CF<small><sub>4</sub></small> per tAl and 0.02 kg C<small><sub>2</sub></small>F<small><sub>6</sub></small> per tAl in 1998 in Norway.
  The effect of future technological change on the emissions factor can be assumed
  to be large, since the costs of modifications in process technology can be offset
  by the costs of saved energy. A considerable reduction in the emission factors
  has already taken place and the present emission factor of 0.5 kg CF<small><sub>4</sub></small> per tAl
  is expected to fall to 0.15 kg CF<small><sub>4</sub></small> per tAl at various rates (see <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a>). An emission factor for C<small><sub>2</sub></small>F<small><sub>6</sub></small>, 10 times lower than that of CF<small><sub>4</sub></small> was used
  in the calculations. The present trend of not replacing CFCs and HCFCs with
  high global warming compounds like PFCs (or SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>) is also assumed to continue,
  which might underestimate the effect of future emissions. The only other source
  included for PFC emissions is semiconductor manufacturing, for which the industry
  has globally adopted a voluntary agreement to reduce its PFC emissions by 10%
  in 2010 relative to 1995 levels.</p>
<p>SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> emissions originate from two main activities - the use of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> as a gas
  insulator in high-voltage electricity equipment, and its use in magnesium foundries,
  in which SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> prevents the oxidation of molten magnesium. The driver for the
  former is electricity demand and for the latter it is future magnesium production,
  which will depend on GDP and a consumption elasticity. Emission factor reductions
  over time that result from more careful handling, recovery, recycling, and substitution
  of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> are assumed for both sources. Fenhann (2000) assumes that in low future
  scenarios SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> emissions factors decline to one-tenth their present values between
  2020 and 2090. In high future scenarios, Fenhann (2000) assumes reduction levels
  are somewhat lower, ranging from 55% to 90% depending on the region. In the
  absence of scenario literature, these assumptions are retained here (see <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a>). Other applications of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> include as a tracer gas in medical surgery
  and the production of semiconductors, and as an insulator in some windows. However,
  these sources are assumed to be cause less than 1% of the global emissions.</p>
