<h3>3.6.5. Ozone Precursors<a name="anc1"></a></h3>
<p>IPCC Working Group I (WGI) SAR (Houghton <i>et al</i>., 1996) confirmed the
  importance of tropospheric ozone as a greenhouse gas. Ozone is produced in the
  troposphere in a complex chain of reactions that involve the ozone precursors
  nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), non-CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> hydrocarbons or volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs),
  and CO. Therefore, it is important to explore possible future developments of
  emissions of these substances to analyze the evolution of tropospheric ozone
  levels.</p>
<h4>3.6.5.1. Nitrogen Oxides<a name="anc2"></a></h4>
<p>NO<sub>x</sub> are released through fossil fuel combustion (24 MtN per year around 1990),
  natural and anthropogenic soil release (12 MtN per year), biomass burning (8
  MtN per year), lightning (5 MtN per year), NH<sub>3</sub> oxidation (3 MtN per year), aircraft
  (0.4 MtN/year), and transport from the stratosphere (0.1 MtN per year). These
  figures are mean estimates within a range; for fossil fuel combustion, aircraft
  emissions, and stratospheric input the ranges may be as narrow as 30%, but for
  natural sources the ranges may be up to a factor of 2 (Prather <i>et al</i>.,
  1995). The uncertainties in the estimates are illustrated by comparison of the
  detailed emissions inventory of Olivier et al. (1996) with the 1994 IPCC estimates
  - while global total emissions estimates by source are very similar, at the
  regional level emissions estimates show pronounced differences, particularly
  in Asia.</p>
<p>Fossil fuel combustion in the electric power and transport sectors is the largest
  source. Emissions from fossil fuel use in North America and Europe have barely
  increased since 1979 because fossil fuel consumption leveled off and air quality
  abatement was enacted, but in Asia emissions are believed to increase by 4%
  annually (Prather <i>et al</i>., 1995). As a result of the first NO<sub>x</sub> Protocol
  in Europe, NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in Europe had decreased from 1987 levels by 13% in
  1994, but the European Union is unlikely to meet its target of the 5th European
  Action Plan of a 30% reduction (EEA, 1999). An important reason is that it is
  difficult to abate NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in the growing transport sector. Perhaps critically,
  there are significant differences between the characteristics of abatement of
  SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. While both substances have regional acidification effects,
  a priority for SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> abatement is induced by its important local health effects.
  Also, whereas SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions relate closely to the type of fuel, NO<sub>x</sub> emissions
  are more dependent on the combustion technology and conditions.</p>
<p>Few scenarios for NO<sub>x</sub> emissions exist beyond the studies for Europe, North
  America, and Japan (IS92 scenarios are a notable exception). New scenarios,
  such as those by Bouwman and van Vuuren (1999) and Collins <i>et al</i>. (1999)
  often still use IS92a as a "loose" baseline, with new abatement policies added
  as they were introduced in the OECD countries after 1992, according to current
  reduction plans (CRP). Collins <i>et al</i>. (1999) also explore a maximum feasible
  reduction scenario, in which European NO<sub>x</sub> emissions decrease by 60% by 2015
  and North American emissions by 5%. In the related CRP scenario of Bouwman and
  van Vuuren (1999), NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in the developing countries are assumed to
  decrease also (by more than 10%) by 2015. These studies, however, should be
  used with care as the authors developed their somewhat arbitrary scenarios primarily
  for atmospheric chemistry analysis; they are not based on an in-depth analysis
  of the characteristics of the emissions sources and potential policies in the
  various regions outside the OECD.</p>
<h4>3.6.5.2. Carbon Monoxide and Non-Methane Hydrocarbons<a name="anc3"></a></h4>
<p>Prather et al. (1995) estimates the total global emissions of CO at 1800 to
  2700 MtC per year in the decade before 1994. The most important of the approximately
  1000 TgC anthropogenic sources are technological (300 to 550 MtC per year) and
  biomass burning (300 to 700 MtC per year). Technological sources dominate in
  the northern hemisphere, and include transport, combustion, industrial processes,
  and refuse incineration. Biomass burning dominates in the southern hemisphere,
  and includes burning of agricultural waste, savanna burning, and deforestation.
  The detailed, geographically explicit EDGAR database (Olivier <i>et al</i>.,
  1996) has similar emissions estimates for CO. Other sources are biogenics (60
  to 160 MtC per year), oceans (20 to 200 MtC per year), and oxidation of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>
  (400 to 1000 MtC per year) and of NMVOCs (200 to 600 MtC per year). To a large
  extent, this oxidation may be considered anthropogenic in origin because many
  emissions sources of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and NMVOCs are of an anthropogenic nature.</p>
<p>Global emissions estimates of NMVOCs are also very uncertain. Prather <i>et
  al</i>. (1995) indicate a global total for anthropogenic NMVOCs of about 140
  MtC per year, from road transport (25%), solvent use (14%), fuel production
  and distribution (13%), fuel consumption (34%), and the rest from uncontrolled
  burning and other sources. The EDGAR inventory by Olivier et al. (1996) suggests
  that global emissions may be higher (178 MtC per year) because of higher estimates
  of emissions from energy production and use. As with CO, emissions in the northern
  hemisphere are dominated by transport and industry, while in the southern hemisphere
  biomass and biofuel burning is often the dominant source. In Europe, emissions
  of NMVOCs are controlled under the 5th Environmental Action Programme of the
  European Union and the VOC Protocol of the UN Convention on Long-Range Transboundary
  Air Pollution. However, for reasons similar to those for NO<sub>x</sub> , the current reduction
  of 11% with respect to 1990 levels and 15% with respect to 1987 levels suggests
  that the planned reduction to 30% in 1999 may not be reached (EEA, 1999). As
  a consequence, threshold values for ozone continue to be exceeded in Europe.</p>
<p>No long-term global scenarios for emissions of NMVOCs and CO were identified
  beyond IS92, which assumes increasing emissions. The important role of biomass
  combustion in these emissions means that a scenario with low carbon emissions
  because of an increased used of biomass energy does not automatically lead to
  low emissions of NMVOCs and CO. Also, emissions trends are influenced significantly
  by assumptions as to the type of combustion or other conversion technology (e.g.
  gasification) deployed in the future. If biomass fuel is used in modern large
  power plants or boilers, or is to be converted into modern energy carriers,
  CO emissions will be almost negligible compared to those of traditional uses.
  As with sulfur, however, it seems plausible that with rising incomes, abatement
  of the ozone precursors may be initiated in non-OECD regions to address local
  and particularly regional air pollution (photochemical smog). Since control
  of these substances is more difficult than that of sulfur, it may not be implemented
  until later.</p>
