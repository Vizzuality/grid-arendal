<h3>6.2.2. Economic Development<a name="anc1"></a> </h3>
<p>The SRES scenarios span a wide range of future levels of economic activity
  (expressed in gross world product). The A1 scenario family with a ("harmonized")
  gross world product of US$529 trillion (all values in 1990 US dollars unless
  otherwise indicated) in 2100 delineates the SRES upper bound, whereas B2 with
  ("harmonized") US$235 trillion in 2100 represents its lower bound. The range
  of gross world product across all scenarios is even higher, from US$197 to US$550
  by 2100.<br>

  Although the SRES scenarios span a wide range, still lower and higher gross
  world product levels can be found in the literature (see Chapters <a href="034.htm">2</a>,
  <a href="049.htm">3</a>, and <a href="089.htm">4</a>). Uncertainties in future
  gross world product levels are governed by the pace of future productivity growth
  and population growth, especially in developing regions. Different assumptions
  on conditions and possibilities for development "catch-up" and for narrowing
  per capita income gaps in particular explain the wide range in projected future
  gross world product levels. Given a qualitatively negative relationship between
  population growth and per capita income growth discussed in Chapters <a href="034.htm">2</a>
  and <a href="049.htm">3</a>, uncertainties in future population growth rates
  tend to narrow the range of associated gross world product projections. High
  population growth would, ceteris paribus, lower per capita income growth, whereas
  low population growth would tend to increase it. This relationship is evident
  in empiric data - high per capita income countries are generally also those
  that have completed their demographic transition. The affluent live long and
  generally have few children. (Exceptions are some countries with small populations,
  high birth rates, and significant income from commodity exports.) This relationship
  between affluence and longevity again identifies development as one of the most
  important indicators of human well being. Yet even assuming this relationship
  holds for an extended time into the future, its quantification is subject to
  considerable theoretic and empiric uncertainties (Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1995).</p>

<p><a name="fig63"></a>Two of the SRES scenario families, A1 and B1, explicitly explore alternative
  pathways to gradually close existing income gaps. As a reflection of uncertainty,
  development "catch-up" diverges in terms of geographically distinct economic
  growth patterns across the four SRES scenario families. <a href="#tbl61">Table
  6-1</a> summarizes per capita income for SRES and IS92 scenarios for the four
  SRES world regions. SRES scenarios indicate a smaller difference between the
  now industrialized and developing countries compared with the IS92 scenarios.
  This tendency toward a substantially narrower income "gap" compared with the
  IS92 scenarios overcomes one of the major shortcomings of the previous IPCC
  scenarios cited in the literature (Parikh, 1992).</p>
<h3>6.2.3. Structural and Technological Change<a name="anc2"></a></h3>
<p>In this brief summary of the SRES scenarios, structural and technological changes
  are illustrated by using energy and land use as examples. These examples are
  characteristic for the driving forces of emissions because the energy system
  and land use are the major sources of GHG and sulfur emission. <a href="089.htm">Chapter
  4</a> gives a more detailed treatment of the full range of emissions driving
  forces across the SRES scenarios.</p>
<h4>6.2.3.1. Energy Systems<a name="anc3"></a></h4>
<p><a href="135.htm#fig63">Figure 6-3</a> illustrates that the change of world
  primary energy structure diverges over time. It shows the contributions of individual
  primary energy sources - the percentage supplied by coal, that by oil and gas,
  and that by all non-fossil sources taken together (for simplicity of presentation
  and because not all models distinguish between renewables and nuclear energy).
  Each corner of the triangle corresponds to a hypothetical situation in which
  all primary energy is supplied by a single source - oil and gas, coal at the
  left, and non-fossil sources (renewables and nuclear) to the right. Historically,
  the primary energy structure has evolved clockwise according to the two "grand
  transitions" (discussed in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>) that are shown by
  the two segments of the "thick black" curve. From 1850 to 1920 the first transition
  can be characterized as the substitution of traditional (non-fossil) energy
  sources by coal. The share of coal increased from 20% to about 70%, while the
  share of non-fossils declined from 80% to about 20%. The second transition,
  from 1920 to 1990, can be characterized as the replacement of coal by oil and
  gas (while the share of non-fossils remained essentially constant). The share
  of oil and gas increased to about 50% and the share of coal declined to about
  30%.</p>
<p><a href="135.htm#fig63">Figure 6-3</a> gives an overview of the divergent evolution
  of global primary energy structures between 1990 and 2100, regrouped into their
  respective scenario families and four A1 scenarios groups that explore different
  technological developments in the energy systems. The SRES scenarios cover a
  wider range of energy structures than the previous IS92 scenario series, which
  reflects advances in knowledge on the uncertainty ranges of future fossil resource
  availability and technological change.</p>
<p>In a clockwise direction, A1 and B1 scenario groups map the structural transitions
  toward higher shares of non-fossil energy in the future, which almost closes
  the historical "loop" that started in 1850. The B2 scenarios indicate a more
  "moderate" direction of change with about half of the energy coming from non-fossil
  sources and the other half shared by coal on one side and oil and gas on the
  other. Finally, the A2 scenario group marks a stark transition back to coal.
  Shares of oil and gas decline while non-fossils increase moderately. What is
  perhaps more significant than the diverging developments in these three marker
  scenarios is that the whole set of 40 scenarios covers virtually all possible
  directions of change, from high shares of oil and gas to high shares of coal
  and non-fossils. In particular, the A1 scenario family covers basically the
  same range of structural change as all other scenarios together. In contrast,
  the IS92 scenarios cluster into two groups; one contains IS92c and IS92d and
  the other the four others. In all of these the share of oil and gas declines,
  and the main structural change occurs between coal on the one hand and non-fossils
  on the other. This divergent nature in the structural change of the energy system
  and in the underlying technological base of the SRES results in a wide span
  of future GHG and sulfur emissions.</p>
