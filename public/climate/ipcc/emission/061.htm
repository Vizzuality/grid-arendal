<h4><a name="anc1"></a>3.3.4.4. Influence of International Trade and Investment</h4>
<p>International trade is recognized as an important source of economic gains,
  as it enables comparative advantages to be exploited and the diffusion of new
  technologies and practices. Equally important are domestic and international
  investments. From an economic perspective, trade reflects gains from increasing
  division of labor, and the historical evidence indicates an associated phenomenal
  growth. Updated (Grübler, 1998a) estimates from Rostow (1978) indicate an increase
  of more than a thousand-fold in international trade since the beginning of the
  19th century. In 1990, world trade accounted for close to US$3.4 trillion (10<sup><small>12</small></sup>), or 13% of world GDP. Chenery <i>et al</i>. (1986) and Barro
  (1997) indicate strong empirical evidence of a positive relationship between
  trade ("openness" of economies) and terms of trade (of the economies) on productivity,
  industrialization, and economic growth. Dosi <i>et al</i>. (1990) highlight
  also the critical roles of policies and institutions in the relative success
  or failure of realizing economic gains from the international division of labor.
  Finally, openness to trade could have negative economic impacts on countries
  that experience a deterioration of terms of trade.</p>
<p>Globalization is an increasingly popular term for an ill-defined collection
  of processes. The most important of these processes appear to be the liberalization
  of markets for goods, services, and capital, and the increasing flow of information
  and capital around the world. According to the neoclassic model, globalization
  should benefit everyone; it helps industry in all countries to move closer to
  the productivity frontier and gives consumers access to a wider choice of goods
  and services at lower prices. In practice, of course, the world is more complicated
  than is assumed in the neoclassic model. Economists such as Dosi <i>et al</i>.
  (1990) and Grossman and Helpman (1991) have experimented with alternative models,
  and shown that some countries may not benefit from free trade or from freely
  available information. Huntington (1996) observes that by "globalization," Americans
  and Europeans often mean "westernization" in the sense of global adoption of
  western social and cultural norms. This process of cultural convergence is a
  source of great concern in many parts of the world. However, Huntington suggests
  that economic globalization may be possible without cultural globalization.</p>
<h4><a name="anc2"></a>3.3.4.5. Influence of Innovation and Technological Change</h4>
<p>The importance of "advances in knowledge" and technology in explaining the
  historical record of productivity growth is mentioned above. In the original
  study by Solow (1957) this was estimated to account for 87% of per capita productivity
  growth (the remainder was attributed to increases in capital inputs). Since
  then further methodological and statistical refinements have reduced the unexplained
  "residual" of productivity growth that is equated to advances in knowledge and
  technology, but it remains the largest single source of long-run productivity
  and economic growth. It is estimated to account for more than one-third of total
  GDP growth in the USA since 1929 (Denison, 1985), and for between 34% and 63%
  of GDP growth in the OECD countries over the period 1947 to 1973 (Barro and
  Sala-I-Martin, 1995).</p>
<p>The observed slowdown in productivity growth rates since the early 1970s is
  generally interpreted as a weakening of the technological frontier in the OECD
  countries (Maddison, 1995; Barro, 1997), although quantitative statistics (and
  even everyday experience) do not corroborate the perception of a slowdown in
  technological innovation and change. An alternative interpretation of slower
  recent productivity growth is that the OECD countries have moved out of a long
  period of industrialization and into post-industrial development as service
  economies. In such economies, productivity is extremely hard to measure, partly
  because services comprise a mixture of government, non-market, and market activities,
  partly because economic accounts measure services primarily via inputs (e.g.
  cost of labor) rather than outputs, and partly because it is difficult to define
  service <i>quality</i>. Nevertheless, labor productivity in the service sector
  appears to grow more slowly than that in the agricultural and industrial sectors
  (Millward, 1990; Baumol, 1993). The traditional concept of labor productivity
  may need revision to be applied usefully to the service economy. </p>
<p>Finally, another interpretation is that productivity growth lags behind technological
  change, because appropriate institutional and social adjustment processes take
  considerable time to be implemented (Freeman and Perez, 1988; David, 1990).
  Once an appropriate "match" (Freeman and Perez, 1988) between institutional
  and technological change is achieved, productivity growth could accelerate.
  Maddison (1995) observes that the 19th century productivity surge in the USA
  was preceded by a long period of investment in infrastructure. Landes (1969)
  notes that both the German and Japanese economic acceleration was preceded by
  a long period of investment in education. Maddison (1995) further suggests that
  recent developments in information technology involve considerable investment,
  both in hardware and in human learning, which may result in higher efficiency
  improvements and productivity gains in the future only. This perspective is
  consistent with the possible emergence of a new "techno-economic paradigm" or
  "Kondratiev wave." This complementary theory of long-term economic development
  focuses on the interplay and interrelationships between institutional and technological
  change. Following Kondratiev's (1926) observation of "long waves" in the American
  economy, Schumpeter (1935) developed a theory to explain these waves on the
  basis of discontinuities in entrepreneurial innovations. Freeman (1990) emphasizes
  Schumpeter's view that long waves are not so much evident in economic statistics
  as in qualitative features of the economy. Freeman and Perez (1988) describe
  five historical waves of technical and economic change and identify associated
  economic booms and recessions (successive "techno-economic paradigms").</p>
<p>Work at IIASA (e.g., Häfele <i>et al</i>., 1982; Grübler and Nakicenovic,
  1991; Nakicenovic, 1996; Grübler <i>et al</i>., 1993b; Grübler, 1998a) sought
  to identify regularities in the market succession of technology in energy supply,
  transport, and the iron and steel industry. In fact, there may be a close parallel
  between the waves of technology they observe and Kondratiev's economic long
  waves. However, both empirical and theoretical implications of "long waves"
  remain unclear (see the review in Freeman, 1996; and especially Rosenberg and
  Frischtak, 1984). Equally, no approach can hope to foresee reliably the form
  of the next "wave." It is possible that solar energy and nuclear power might
  play a strong role, perhaps combined with hydrogen as an energy carrier, as
  suggested by Häfele <i>et al</i>. (1982) and others. The next wave in transport
  technology might well be an increasing share for aviation and high speed rail
  (Grübler and Nakicenovic, 1991), a transition to 0.5 litre/100 km "hypercars"
  (Lovins <i>et al</i>., 1993), or a radical change in urban planning to minimize
  transport needs (Newman and Kenworthy, 1990). These possibilities highlight
  in particular the need for technology diffusion to avoid technological "lock-in"
  to older technological vintages (Parikh <i>et al</i>., 1997).</p>
