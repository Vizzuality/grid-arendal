<h1><a name="anc1"></a>6. Narrative Scenarios and Storylines</h1>
<p>Given these large ranges of future emissions and their driving forces, there
  is an infinite number of possible alternative futures to explore. The SRES scenarios
  cover a finite, albeit a very wide range, of future emissions. The approach
  involved the development of a set of four alternative scenario "families" comprising
  40 SRES scenarios subdivided into seven scenario groups. During the approval
  process of the SPM in March 2000 at the 5th Session of WGIII in Katmandu, it
  was decided to combine two of these groups into one, resulting in six groups.
  To facilitate the process of identifying and describing alternative future developments,
  each scenario family includes a coherent narrative part called a "storyline,"
  and a number of alternative interpretations and quantifications of each storyline
  developed by six different modeling approaches. All the interpretations and
  quantifications of one storyline together are called a scenario family (see
  also <a href="025.htm#box11">Box 1-1</a> in <a href="023.htm">Chapter 1</a> on terminology). Each storyline describes a demographic,
  social, economic, technological, environmental, and policy future for one of
  these scenario families. Storylines were formulated by the writing team in a
  process which identified driving forces, key uncertainties, possible scenario
  families, and their logic. Within each family different scenarios explore variations
  of global and regional developments and their implications for GHG and sulfur
  emissions. Each of these scenarios is consistent with the broad framework of
  that scenario family as specified by the storyline. Consequently, each scenario
  family and scenario group is equally sound. <a href="089.htm">Chapters 4</a> and <a href="114.htm">5</a> give a more detailed
  description of the storylines, their quantifications, and the resultant 40 emissions
  scenarios.</p>
<p>The main reasons for formulating storylines are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to help the writing team to think more coherently about the complex interplay
    among scenario driving forces within each and across alternative scenarios;</li>
  <li>to make it easier to explain the scenarios to the various user communities
    by providing a narrative description of alternative futures that goes beyond
    quantitative scenario features;</li>
  <li>to make the scenarios more useful, in particular to analysts who contribute
    to IPCC WGII and WGIII; the social, political, and technological context described
    in the scenario storylines is all-important in analyzing the effects of policies
    either to adapt to climate change or to reduce GHG emissions; and</li>
  <li>to provide a guide for additional assumptions to be made in detailed climate
    impact and mitigation analyses, because at present no single model or scenario
    can possibly respond to the wide variety of informational and data needs of
    the different user communities of long-term emissions scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SRES writing team reached broad agreement that there could be no "best
  guess" scenarios; that the future is inherently unpredictable and that views
  will differ on which of the storylines could be more likely. The writing team
  decided on four storylines: an even number helps to avoid the impression that
  there is a "central" or "most likely" case. The team wanted more than two in
  order to help illustrate that the future depends on many different underlying
  dynamics; the team did not want more than four, as they wanted to avoid complicating
  the process by too many alternatives. There is no "business-as-usual" scenario.
  Nor should the scenarios be taken as policy recommendations. The storylines
  represent the playing out of certain social, economic, technological, and environmental
  paradigms, which will be viewed positively by some people and negatively by
  others. The scenarios cover a wide range, but not all possible futures. In particular,
  it was decided that possible "surprises" would not be considered and that there
  would be no "disaster" scenarios that are difficult to quantify with the aid
  of formal models.</p>
<p>The titles of the storylines have been kept simple: A1, A2, B1, and B2. There
  is no particular order among the storylines; <a href="012.htm#boxts1">Box TS-1</a> lists them in alphabetic
  order. <a href="#figts2">Figure TS-2</a> schematically illustrates the four
  storylines and scenario families. Each is based on a common specification of
  the main driving forces. They are shown, very simplistically, as branches of
  a two-dimensional tree. The two dimensions shown indicate the global-regional
  and the development-environmental orientation, respectively. In reality, the
  four scenario families share a space of a much higher dimensionality given the
  numerous driving forces and other assumptions needed to define any given scenario
  in a particular modeling approach. The team decided to carry out sensitivity
  tests within some of the storylines by considering alternative scenarios with
  different fossil-fuel reserves, rates of economic growth, or rates of technical
  change within a given scenario family. For example, four scenario "groups" within
  the A1 scenario family were explored. As mentioned, two of these four groups
  that explore fossil-intensive developments in the energy system were merged
  in the SPM. Together with the other three scenario families this results in
  seven groups of scenarios effectively six equally sound groups after the merging
  of the two fossil-intensive groups in the SPM - that share common assumptions
  of some of the key driving forces and are thus not independent of each other.</p>

<p>All four storylines and scenario families describe future worlds that are generally
  more affluent compared to the current situation. They range from very rapid
  economic growth and technological change to high levels of environmental protection,
  from low to high global populations, and from high to low GHG emissions. What
  is perhaps even more important is that all the storylines describe dynamic changes
  and transitions in generally different directions. Although they do not include
  additional climate initiatives, none of them are policy free. As time progresses,
  the storylines diverge from each other in many of their characteristic features.
  In this way they allow us to span the relevant range of GHG emissions and different
  combinations of their main sources.</p>

      <p><b><a name="boxts1"></a>Box TS-1: The Main Characteristics of the Four SRES Storylines and
	Scenario Families</b><br>
	By 2100 the world will have changed in ways that are hard to imagine -
	as hard as it would have been at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century to imagine
	the changes of the 100 years since. Each storyline assumes a distinctly
	different direction for future developments, such that the four storylines
	differ in increasingly irreversible ways. Together they describe divergent
	futures that encompass a significant portion of the underlying uncertainties
	in the main driving forces. They cover a wide range of key "future" characteristics
	such as population growth, economic development, and technological change.
	For this reason, their plausibility or feasibility should not be considered
	solely on the basis of an extrapolation of <i>current </i>economic, technological,
	and social trends.</p>
      <ul>
	    <li>The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very
	  rapid economic growth, low population growth, and the rapid introduction
	  of new and more efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are
	  convergence among regions, capacity building, and increased cultural
	  and social interactions, with a substantial reduction in regional differences
	  in per capita income. The A1 scenario family develops into four groups
	  that describe alternative directions of technological change in the
	  energy system. Two of the fossil-intensive groups were merged in the
	  SPM.</li>
        <li>The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous
	  world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local
	  identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly,
	  which results in high population growth. Economic development is primarily
	  regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and technological
	  change are more fragmented and slower than in other storylines.</li>
        <li>The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world
	  with the same low population growth as in the A1 storyline, but with
	  rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and information
	  economy, with reductions in material intensity, and the introduction
	  of clean and resource-efficient technologies. The emphasis is on global
	  solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability, including
	  improved equity, but without additional climate initiatives.</li>
        <li>The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the
	  emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social, and environmental
	  sustainability. It is a world with moderate population growth, intermediate
	  levels of economic development, and less rapid and more diverse technological
	  change than in the B1 and A1 storylines. While the scenario is also
	  oriented toward environmental protection and social equity, it focuses
	  on local and regional levels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After determining the basic features and driving forces for each of the
	four storylines, the team began modeling and quantifying the storylines.
	This resulted in 40 scenarios, each of which constitutes an alternative
	interpretation and quantification of a storyline. All the interpretations
	and quantifications associated with a single storyline are called a scenario
	family (see <a href="023.htm">Chapter 1</a> for terminology and <a href="089.htm">Chapter
	4</a> for further details).</p>
