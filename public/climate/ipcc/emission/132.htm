<h1>6.1. Introduction and Background</h1>
<p>The set of 40 emissions scenarios in this Special Report on Emissions Scenarios
  (SRES) is based on an extensive assessment of the literature, six alternative
  modeling approaches, and an "open process" that solicited wide participation
  and feedback from many groups and individuals. The set of scenarios includes
  all relevant species of greenhouse gases (GHGs)<sup><small><a href="fn7.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(7,1); return false;">1</a></small></sup>
  . This chapter provides a summary of the SRES emissions scenarios and compares
  them with the previous set of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
  IS92 scenarios and the underlying literature.</p>
<p>The first step in the formulation of the scenarios was the review and analysis
  of the published literature and the development of the database with more than
  400 emissions scenarios (accessible on the web site, <a target="_top" href="http://www-cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/ipcc.html">www-cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/db/ipcc.html</a>). One of the recommendations of the writing team is
  that IPCC or a similar international institution should maintain such a database
  to ensure continuity of knowledge and scientific progress in any future assessments
  of GHG scenarios. An equivalent database to document narrative and other qualitative
  scenarios would also be very useful for future climate-change assessments. One
  difficulty encountered in the analysis of the emissions scenarios is that the
  distinction between climate policy scenarios, non-climate policy scenarios,
  and other scenarios appeared to be to a degree arbitrary and was often impossible
  to make. Therefore, the writing team recommends that an effort should be made
  in the future to develop an appropriate emissions scenario classification scheme.
  Chapters <a href="034.htm">2</a> and <a href="049.htm">3</a> give a more detailed
  description of the very wide range of future emissions paths, their driving
  forces, and their relationships as reflected in the literature; the wide rage
  indicates that their possible developments are highly uncertain. The sources
  of inherent uncertainties range from data and modeling uncertainties through
  to inadequate scientific understanding of the underlying problems.</p>
<p>Scenarios are appropriate tools for dealing with such uncertainty. Scenarios
  are images of the future, or alternative futures. As an integration tool in
  the assessment of climate change they allow a role for intuition, analysis,
  and synthesis; thus we turn to scenarios in this report to take advantage of
  these features to aid the assessment of future climate change, impacts, vulnerabilities,
  adoption, and mitigation. Scenarios are not predictions. A set of scenarios
  can assist in the understanding of possible future developments, and hence the
  development of a set of alternative scenarios (see Chapters <a href="023.htm">1</a>
  and <a href="089.htm">4</a> for more detail).</p>
<p>The SRES approach involved the development of a set of four alternative scenario
  "families" that encompass the 40 scenarios. Each family of SRES scenarios includes
  a descriptive part called a "storyline," and a number of alternative interpretations
  and quantifications of each storyline developed by six different modeling approaches.
  All the interpretations and quantifications of one storyline together are called
  a scenario family (see <a href="023.htm">Chapter 1</a> for terminology). Each
  storyline describes a demographic, social, economic, technological, and policy
  future for one of these scenario families. Within each family different scenarios
  explore variations of global and regional developments and their implications
  for GHG and sulfur emissions. Each of these scenarios is consistent with the
  broad framework of that scenario family as specified by the storyline. Chapters
  <a href="089.htm">4</a> and <a href="114.htm">5</a> give a more detailed description
  of the storylines, their quantifications, and the resultant 40 emissions scenarios.</p>
<p>The SRES writing team reached a broad consensus that there could be no "best
  guess" scenarios; that the future is inherently unpredictable and that views
  will differ as to which storylines could be more likely. There is no "business-as-usual"
  scenario. The storylines represent the playing out of certain social, economic,
  technological and environmental paradigms that will be viewed positively by
  some people and negatively by others. The writing team decided on four storylines
  - an even number helps to avoid the impression that there is a "central" or
  "most likely" case. The team wanted more than two storylines to help illustrate
  that the future depends on many different underlying dynamics, but no more than
  four, as they wanted to avoid complicating the process with too many alternatives.
  The scenarios cover a wide range, but not all possible futures. In particular,
  it was decided that possible "surprises" would not be considered and that there
  would be no "disaster" scenarios.</p>
<p>The storylines describe developments in many different social, economic, technological,
  environmental, and policy dimensions. The titles of the storylines have been
  kept simple - A1, A2, B1, and B2. There is no particular order among the storylines,
  which are listed in <a href="#box61">Box 6-1</a> in alphabetic order. The team decided to carry out
  sensitivity tests within some of the storylines by considering alternative scenarios
  with different fossil-fuel reserves, rates of economic growth, or rates of technological
  change within a given scenario family.</p>
<p>All four storylines and scenario families describe future worlds that are generally
  more affluent compared to the current situation. They range from very rapid
  economic growth and technological change to high levels of environmental protection,
  from low to high global populations, and from high to low GHG emissions. What
  is perhaps even more important is that all the storylines describe dynamic changes
  and transitions in generally different directions. Although they do not include
  additional climate initiatives, none of them are policy free. As time progresses,
  the storylines diverge from each other in many of their characteristic features.
  In this way they span the relevant range of GHG emissions and different combinations
  of their main sources.</p>
<p>After determining the basic features and driving forces for each of the four
  storylines, the team quantified the storylines into individual scenarios with
  the help of formal (computer) models. The six modeling groups that quantified
  the storylines are listed in <a href="133.htm#box62">Box 6-2</a>. The six models
  are representative of different approaches to modeling emissions scenarios and
  different integrated assessment (IA) frameworks in the literature and include
  so-called top-down and bottom-up models. The writing team recommends that IPCC
  or a similar international institution should ensure participation of modeling
  groups around the world, and especially those from developing countries, in
  future scenario development and assessment efforts. Clearly, this would also
  require resources specifically to assist modeling groups from developing countries.
  Indeed, a concerted effort was made to engage modeling groups and experts from
  developing countries in SRES as a direct response to recommendations of the
  IPCC scenario evaluation (Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1995).</p>

      <p>By 2100 the world will have changed in ways that are hard to imagine
	- as hard as it would have been at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century to imagine
	the changes of the 100 years since. Each storyline assumes a distinctly
	different direction for future developments, such that the four storylines
	differ in increasingly irreversible ways. Together they describe divergent
	futures that encompass a significant portion of the underlying uncertainties
	in the main driving forces. They cover a wide range of key "future" characteristics
	such as population growth, economic development, and technological change.
	For this reason, their plausibility or feasibility should not be considered
	solely on the basis of an extrapolation of <i>current</i> economic, technological,
	and social trends.</p>
      <ul>
	<li>The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very
	  rapid economic growth, low population growth, and the rapid introduction
	  of new and more efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are
	  convergence among regions, capacity building and increased cultural
	  and social interactions, with a substantial reduction in regional differences
	  in per capita income. The A1 scenario family develops into four groups
	  that describe alternative directions of technological change in the
	  energy system. Please note that in the Summary for Policymakers, two
	  of these groups were merged into one.<sup><small><a href="fn7.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(7,2); return false;">2</a></small></sup></li>
	<li>The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous
	  world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local
	  identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly,
	  which results in high population growth. Economic development is primarily
	  regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and technological
	  change are more fragmented and slower than in other storylines.</li>
	<li>The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world
	  with the same low population growth as in the A1 storyline, but with
	  rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and information
	  economy, with reductions in material intensity, and the introduction
	  of clean and resource-efficient technologies. The emphasis is on global
	  solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability, including
	  improved equity, but without additional climate initiatives.</li>
	<li>The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the
	  emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social, and environmental
	  sustainability. It is a world with moderate population growth, intermediate
	  levels of economic development, and less rapid and more diverse technological
	  change than in the B1 and A1 storylines. While the scenario is also
	  oriented toward environmental protection and social equity, it focuses
	  on local and regional levels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After determining the basic features and driving forces for each of the
	four storylines, the team began modeling and quantifying the storylines.
	This resulted in 40 scenarios, each of which constitutes an alternative
	interpretation and quantification of a storyline. All the interpretations
	and quantifications associated with a single storyline are called a scenario
	"family" (see <a href="023.htm">Chapter 1</a> for terminology and <a href="089.htm">Chapter
	4</a> for further details).</p>
