<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly established
  by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment
  Programme (UNEP) to assess the scientific, technical and socio-economic information
  relevant for the understanding of the risk of human-induced climate change.
  Since its inception the IPCC has produced a series of comprehensive Assessment
  Reports on the state of understanding of causes of climate change, its potential
  impacts and options for response strategies. It prepared also Special Reports,
  Technical Papers, methodologies and guidelines. These IPCC publications have
  become standard works of reference, widely used by policymakers, scientists
  and other experts.</p>
<p>In 1992 the IPCC released emission scenarios to be used for driving global
  circulation models to develop climate change scenarios. The so-called IS92 scenarios
  were pathbreaking. They were the first global scenarios to provide estimates
  for the full suite of greenhouse gases. Much has changed since then in our understanding
  of possible future greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Therefore the
  IPCC decided in 1996 to develop a new set of emissions scenarios which will
  provide input to the IPCC third assessment report but can be of broader use
  than the IS92 scenarios. The new scenarios provide also input for evaluating
  climatic and environmental consequences of future greenhouse gas emissions and
  for assessing alternative mitigation and adaptation strategies. They include
  improved emission baselines and latest information on economic restructuring
  throughout the world, examine different rates and trends in technological change
  and expand the range of different economic-development pathways, including narrowing
  of the income gap between developed and developing countries. To achieve this
  a new approach was adopted to take into account a wide range of scientific perspectives,
  and interactions between regions and sectors. Through the so-called "open process"
  input and feedback from a community of experts much broader than the writing
  team were solicited. The results of this work show that different social, economic
  and technological developments have a strong impact on emission trends, without
  assuming explicit climate policy interventions. The new scenarios provide also
  important insights about the interlinkages between environmental quality and
  development choices and will certainly be a useful tool for experts and decision
  makers.</p>
<p>As usual in the IPCC, success in producing this report has depended first and
  foremost on the co-operation of scientists and other experts worldwide. In the
  case of this report the active contribution of a broad expert community to the
  open process was an important element of the success. These individuals have
  devoted enormous time and effort to producing this report and we are extremely
  grateful for their commitment to the IPCC process. We would like to highlight
  in particular the enthusiasm and tireless efforts of the co-ordinating lead
  author for this report Nebojsa Nakicenovic and his team at the International
  Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg/Austria who ensured
  the high quality of this report.</p>
<p>Further we would like to express our sincere thanks to:</p>

  <li> Robert T. Watson, the Chairman of the IPCC,</li>
  <li>The Co-chairs of Working Group III Bert Metz and Ogunlade Davidson,</li>
