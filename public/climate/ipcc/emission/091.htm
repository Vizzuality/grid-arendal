<h1>4.2. SRES Scenario Taxonomy</h1>
<h3> 4.2.1. Storylines<b><i><a name="4.2.1."></a></i></b></h3>
<p>The primary purpose of developing multiple scenario families was to explore
  the uncertainties behind potential trends in global developments and GHG emissions,
  as well as the key drivers that influence these (see also <a href="023.htm">Chapter
  1</a>, <a href="030.htm">Section 1.7.2</a>). The writing team decided that narrative storylines, based
  on the futures and scenario literature, would be the most coherent way to describe
  their scenarios, for the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To help the team to think more coherently about the complex interplay between
    scenario driving forces within and across alternative scenarios and to enhance
    the consistency in assumptions for different parameters.</li>
  <li>To make it easier to explain the scenarios to the various user communities
    by providing a narrative description of alternative futures that goes beyond
    quantitative scenario features.</li>
  <li>To make the scenarios more useful, in particular, to analysts contributing
    to IPCC WGs II and III. The demographic, social, political, and technological
    contexts described in the scenario storylines are all-important in the analysis
    of the effects of policies to either adapt to climate change or to reduce
    GHG emissions.</li>
  <li>To provide a guide for additional assumptions to be made in detailed climate-impact
    and mitigation analyses, because at present no model or scenario can possibly
    respond to the wide variety of informational and data needs of the different
    user communities of long-term emissions scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>The four scenario families presented in this report are representative of a
  broad range of scenarios found in the literature, but they are not directly
  based on any particular published scenario taxonomy or set of scenarios. Rather,
  the storylines of each scenario family were developed on the basis of the general
  knowledge of this literature, and on the personal experience and creativity
  within the writing team. The writing team spent the better part of the first
  year (1997) formulating the storylines, which during the following two years
  were revised iteratively with the scenario development until the completion
  of the report.</p>
<p>Four brief "future histories" captured by the SRES storylines differ in how
  global regions interrelate, how new technologies diffuse, how regional economic
  activities evolve, how protection of local and regional environments is implemented,
  and how demographic structure changes. The "qualitative" storyline characteristics
  include various political, social, cultural, and educational conditions (e.g.,
  type of governance, social structure, and educational level) that often cannot
  be defined in strictly quantitative terms and do not directly "drive" GHG emissions.
  These qualitative variables, however, participate in complex "cause-effect"
  relationships with quantitative emission drivers (e.g., economic activities,
  population levels, energy consumption). Their explicit inclusion in the scenario
  development process not only makes scenarios more "plausible" and "believable,"
  but also ensures they do not become an arbitrary numeric combination of quantitative
  parameters.</p>
<p>The SRES storylines do not include explicit policies to limit GHG emissions
  or to adapt to the expected global climate change, reflecting the SRES Terms
  of Reference (see <a href="146.htm">Appendix I</a>). However, the storyline
  demographic, social, economic and technological profiles can be used in other
  studies to develop and evaluate climate-change mitigation and adaptation measures
  and policies. Such evaluation would require additional (prescriptive) assumptions
  about policies and measures to affect future climates and human responses to
  climate change now absent from the storylines.</p>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Box 4-2</b>: "Neutrality" of the SRES Scenarios
      The SRES scenarios are intended to exclude catastrophic futures. Such catastrophic
      futures feature prominently in the literature. They typically involve large-scale
      environmental or economic collapses, and extrapolate current unfavorable
      conditions and trends in many regions. Prominent examples of such scenarios
      include "Retrenchment" (Kinsman, 1990), "Dark Side of the Market World"
      or "Change without Progress" (Schwartz, 1991), "Black and Grey" (Godet et
      al., 1994), "Global Incoherence Scenario" (Peterson, 1994), "New World Disorder"
      (Schwartz, 1996), "A Visit to Belindia" (Pohl, 1994), the future evoked
      by the description of the current situation in parts of West-Africa and
      Central Asia (Kaplan, 1996), "Barbarization" (Gallopin et al., 1997), "Dark
      Space" (Glenn and Gordon, 1999), "Global Fragmentation" (Lawrence et al.,
      1997), and "A Passive Mean World" (Glenn and Gordon, 1997, 1999). In this
      last scenario the world is carved up into three rigid and distinct trading
      blocs, with fragmented political boundaries and out-of-control ethnic conflicts.
      In "Global Crisis" (de Jong and Zalm, 1991; CPB, 1992) protectionism leads
      to a vicious circle of slowing economic growth and eventually breakdown.
      Many of these scenarios suggest that catastrophic developments may draw
      the world into a state of chaos within one or two decades. In such scenarios
      GHG emissions might be low because of low or negative economic growth, but
      it seems unlikely they would receive much attention in the light of more
      immediate problems. Hence, this report does not analyze such futures.</td>

<p>All four SRES "futures" represented by the distinct storylines are treated
  as equally possible and there are no "central," "business-as-usual,""surprise,"
  or "disaster" futures (examples of which are given in <a href="#box42">Box 4.2</a>).
  All of the storylines have features that can be interpreted as "positive" or
  "negative" and they play out different tendencies and changes in part visible
  in the world today. To avoid the tendency to overemphasize "positive" or "negative"
  features of individual storylines, their titles were kept simple. Many attempts
  were made to capture the spirit of each storyline with a short and snappy title,
  but no single title was found to reflect adequately the complex mix of characteristics
  of any storyline.</p>
<p>By 2100 the world will have changed in ways that are difficult to imagine,
  as difficult as it was at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century to imagine the changes
  of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. However, each storyline takes a different direction of
  future developments so that they differ in an increasingly irreversible way.
  They describe divergent futures that reflect a significant portion of the underlying
  uncertainties in the main driving forces. The differences among the storylines
  cover a wide range of the key "future" characteristics, such as technology,
  governance, and behavioral patterns. Hence the plausibility or feasibility of
  the storyline assumptions should be viewed with an "open mind," not from a narrow
  interpretation of current situations and trends in economic conditions, technology
  developments, and social and governing structures.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of future developments that take distinct development
  paths in the four storylines include (see also <a href="#tbl42">Table
  4-2</a> for an overview):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nature of the global and regional demographic develop-ments in relation
    to other characteristics of the storyline.</li>
  <li>Extent to which economic globalization and increased social and cultural
    interactions continue over the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</li>
  <li>Rates of global and regional economic developments and trade patterns in
    relation to the other characteristics of the storyline.</li>
  <li>Rates and direction of global and regional technological change, especially
    in relation to the economic development prospects.</li>
  <li>Extent to which local and regional environmental concerns shape the direction
    of future development and environmental controls.</li>
  <li>Degree to which human and natural resources are mobilized globally and regionally
    to achieve multiple development objectives of each storyline.</li>
  <li>Balance of economic, social, technological, or environmental objectives
    in the choices made by consumers, governments, enterprises, and other stakeholders</li>

    <td><b>Box 4-3</b>: Globalization Issues With the convergence
      in governments' economic policies in the 1990s, combined with the rapid
      development of communication networks, it is perhaps not surprising that
      an extensive poll of scenarios by the Millennium Institute suggested "globalization"
      as the main driving force that will shape the future (Glenn and Gordon,
      1997, 1999). However, some scenarios in the literature explore the possibility
      that unfettered markets, usually seen as an integral element of "globalization,"
      might destabilize society in ways that endanger the process (Mohan Rao,
      1998). In UNESCO's 1998 World Culture Report, it is noted that communities
      are increasingly emphasizing their cultural individuality; meanwhile, communication
      and travel are resulting in interactions between communities that result
      in the evolution of new "local" cultures (UNESCO, 1998). Huntington (1996)
      asserts that continental regional cultures may determine the shape of future
      geopolitical developments rather than globalization.</td>

<p>Thus, the storylines describe developments in many different economic, technical,
  environmental, and social dimensions. Consequently, they occupy a multidimensional
  space and no simple metric can be used to classify them. Even though they occupy
  such a multidimensional space along many driving forces relevant for GHG emissions,
  it is useful here to highlight just two dimensions. The first refers to the
  extent of economic convergence and social and cultural interactions across the
  regions and the second to the balance between economic objectives and environmental
  and equity objectives. Possible names for these two dimensions could be "globalization"
  (<a href="#box4.3">Box 4-3</a>) and "sustainability," respectively (<a href="#box4.4">Box
  4-4</a>). As these two expressions are not necessarily viewed by everyone as
  being value-free, the two dimensions could alternatively be designated simply
  as a more global or more regional orientation and as a more economic or a more
  environmental orientation (see <a href="090.htm#fig41">Figure 4-1</a>). These
  dimensions are important in the SRES scenarios. Nevertheless, there was considerable
  resistance in the SRES writing team against such a simplistic classification
  of storylines, so it is presented here for illustrative purposes only. These
  distinctions are, in a sense, artificial. For example, both economic and environmental
  objectives are pursued in all scenarios, albeit with different levels of relative

  will prevail in the 21<sup>st</sup> century is pertinent to the distinction between the
  A1 and B1 scenario families on one side and A2 and B2 families on the other
  side. While the A1 and B1 storylines, to different degrees, emphasize successful
  economic global convergence and social and cultural interactions, A2 and B2
  focus on a blossoming of diverse regional development pathways (see <a href="#box4.3">Box

    <td><b>Box 4-4</b>: Sustainability Issues Recent decades
      have seen considerable growth in discourse of environmental and social issues,
      represented at the global level by several high-level United Nations (UN)
      meetings on social and economic development and environmental sustainability
      (UNCED, 1992; UN, 1994, 1995; Leach, 1998; Munasinghe and Swart,2000). The
      range of participants has expanded from the most closely involved government
      ministries, businesses, and environmental NGOs to include a broad range
      of representation by different ministries, local government, businesses,
      professions, and community groups. Increased interest in sustainability
      issues can lead to all kinds of socio-economic and technological changes
      that may not be aimed explicitly at reducing GHG emissions, but which may
      in effect contribute significantly to such reductions.</td>

<p>The extent to which the currently observed economic and environmental orientations
  will prevail in the 21<sup>st</sup> century is pertinent to the distinction between A1
  and A2 scenario families on one side and B1 and B2 scenario families on the
  other side. In the B1 and B2 storylines this transition is pursued, to different
  degrees, through a successful translation of global concerns into local actions
  to promote environmental sustainability. Alternatively, in the A1 and A2 storylines
  the emphasis remains, again to different degrees, on sustained economic development
  and achievement of high levels of affluence throughout the world, where environmental
  priorities are perceived as less important than those of economic development
  (see <a href="#box4.4">Box 4-4</a>).</p>
<p>In short, each of the storylines can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very rapid
      economic growth, low population growth, and the rapid introduction of new
      and more efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are convergence
      among regions, capacity building, and increased cultural and social interactions,
      with a substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita income.
      The A1 scenario family develops into four groups that describe alternative
      directions of technological change in the energy system.<sup><small><a href="fn5.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(5,1); return false;">1</a></small></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world.
    The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local identities.
    Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which results in high
    population growth. Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and
    per capita economic growth and technological change are more fragmented and
    slower than in other storylines.</li>
  <li>The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with the
    same low population growth as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid changes
    in economic structures toward a service and information economy, with reductions
    in material intensity, and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient
    technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social, and
    environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without additional
    climate initiatives.</li>
  <li>The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis
    is on local solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability.
    It is a world with moderate population growth, intermediate levels of economic
    development, and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in
    the B1 and A1 storylines. While the scenario is also oriented toward environmental
    protection and social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels.</li>
</ul>

  4.3</a>, which includes their original quantitative indicators that served as
  input to the scenario quantification process.</p>
