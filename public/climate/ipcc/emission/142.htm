<h1><a name="anc1"></a>6.4. Summary and Conclusions</h1>
<p>In summary, the SRES scenarios lead to the following findings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alternative combinations of driving forces can lead to similar levels and
    structure of energy and land-use patterns, as illustrated by different scenarios
    and groups. Hence, even for a given scenario outcome (e.g. in terms of GHG
    emissions) there are alternative combinations of driving forces and pathways
    that could lead to that outcome. For instance, significant global changes
    could result from a scenario of high population growth, even if per capita
    incomes rise only modestly, as well as from a scenario in which a rapid demographic
    transition (to low population levels) coincides with high rates of income
    growth and affluence.</li>
  <li>Important possibilities for further bifurcations in future development trends
    exist within one scenario family, even when particular values are adopted
    for the important scenario driving force variables to illustrate a particular
    development path. The four technology scenario groups in A1 family (combined
    into three in the Summary for Policymakers) illustrate such alternative development
    paths with similar quantifications of the main driving forces.</li>
  <li>Emissions profiles are dynamic across the range of SRES scenarios. They
    portray trend reversals and indicate possible emissions crossover among different
    scenarios. They do not represent mere extensions of continuous increase of
    GHGs and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions into the future. This more complex pattern of future
    emissions across the range of SRES scenarios, time periods, world regions,
    and sectors reflects recent scenario literature.</li>
  <li>Describing potential future developments involves inherent ambiguities and
    uncertainties. One and only one possible development path (as alluded to,
    for instance, in concepts such as "business-as-usual scenario") simply does
    not exist alone. And even for each alternative development path described
    by any given scenario, there are numerous combinations of driving forces and
    numeric values that can be consistent with a particular scenario description.
    The numeric precision of any model result should not distract from the basic
    fact that uncertainty abounds. However, the multi-model approach increases
    the value of the SRES scenario set, since uncertainties in the choice of model
    input assumptions can be separated more explicitly from the specific model
    behavior and related modeling uncertainties.</li>
  <li>Any scenario has subjective elements and is open to various interpretations.
    While the writing team as a whole has no preference for any of the scenarios,
    and has no judgment as to the probability or desirability of different scenarios,
    the open process and initial reactions to draft versions of this report show
    that individuals and interest groups do have such judgments. The writing team
    hopes that this will stimulate an open discussion in the policy making arena
    about potential futures and choices that can be made in the context of climate
    change response. For the scientific community, the SRES scenario exercise
    has led to the identification of a number of recom-mendations for future research
    that can further increase the understanding of potential developments of socio-economic
    driving forces and their interactions, and the associated GHG emissions. A
    summary of main findings and recommendations for potential users of the SRES
    scenarios is given in <a href="#box63">Box 6-3</a> and <a href="#box64">Box
    6-4</a>. The writing teams' suggestions for consideration by the IPCC are
    summarized in <a href="#box65">Box 6-5</a>.</li>
  <li>Finally, the writing team believes that the SRES scenarios largely fulfill
    all the specifications set out in <a href="023.htm">Chapter 1</a>. To support
    reproducibility, more detailed information than can be included in this report
    will be made available by individual modeling groups and members of the writing
    team through other means, such as web sites, peer-reviewed literature, or
    background documentation if additional resources can be made available.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, Tables <a href="143.htm#tbl62a">6-2a</a> and <a href="143.htm#tbl62b">6-2b</a>
  summarize the main characteristics of the seven scenario groups that constitute
  the four families (combined into six groups in the <a href="001.htm">Summary
  for Policymakers</a>). The tables give the global ranges of driving forces and
  emissions in 2020, 2050, and 2100. <a href="143.htm#tbl62a">Table 6-2a</a> summarizes
  the ranges of the main scenario driving forces: global population, economic
  development, per capita income levels and income ratios, energy intensity, primary
  energy use, and structure of energy supply. <a href="143.htm#tbl62b">Table 6-2b</a>
  summarizes the emissions of GHGs, SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> , and ozone precursors emissions for the
  years 2020, 2050, and 2100 as well as cumulative 1990- 2100 CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions broken
  down into energy- and land-use related sources. Together, the two tables provide
  a concise summary of the new SRES scenarios.<br>

      <ul>
	    <li>The four scenario families each have a narrative storyline and consist
	  of 40 scenarios developed by six modeling groups.</li>
        <li>The 40 scenarios cover the full range of GHGs and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions consistent
	  with the underlying range of driving forces from scenario literature.</li>
        <li>The 40 SRES scenarios fall into different groups - the three scenario
	  families A2, B1, and B2, plus four groups within the A1 scenario family,
	  two of which (A1C and A1G) have been combined into one fossil-intensive
	  group A1FI in the Summary for Policymakers; see also <a href="fn7.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(7,2); return false;">footnote
	  2</a>. The four A1 groups are distinguished by their technological emphasis
	  - on coal (A1C), oil and gas (A1G), non-fossil energy sources (A1T),
	  or a balance across all sources (A1).</li>
        <li>The scenarios are grouped into four categories of cumulative CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions,
	  which indicate that scenarios with different driving forces can lead
	  to similar cumulative emissions and those with similar driving forces
	  can branch out into different categories of cumulative emissions.</li>
        <li>Four from 40 scenarios are designated as marker scenarios that are
	  characteristic of the four scenarios families. Together with the two
	  additional illustrative scenarios selected from the scenario groups
	  in the A1 family, they capture most of the emissions and driving forces
	  spanned by the full set of the scenarios.</li>
        <li>There is no single central or "best guess" scenario, and probabilities
	  or likelihood are not assigned to individual scenarios. Instead, the
	  writing team recommends that the smallest set of scenarios used should
	  include the four designated marker scenarios and the two additional
	  illustrative scenarios selected from the scenario groups in the A1 family.</li>
        <li>Distinction between scenarios that envisage stringent environmental
	  policies and those that include direct climate policies was very difficult
	  to make, a difficulty associated with many definitional and other ambiguities.</li>
        <li>All scenarios describe futures that are generally more affluent than
	  today. Many of the scenarios envisage a more rapid convergence in per
	  capita income ratios in the world compared to the IS92 scenarios while,
	  at the same time, they jointly cover a wide range of GHG and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions.</li>
        <li>Emissions profiles are more dynamic than the IS92 scenarios, which
	  reflects changes in future emissions trends for some scenarios and GHG
	  species.</li>
        <li>The levels of GHG emissions are generally lower than the IS92 levels,
	  especially toward the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, while emissions of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, 
      which have a cooling effect on the atmosphere, are significantly lower than in IS92.</li>
        <li>Alternative combinations of main scenario driving forces can lead
	  to similar levels of GHG emissions by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Scenarios
	  with different underlying assumptions can result in very similar climate
	  changes.</li>
        <li>Technology is at least as important a driving force of GHG emissions
	  as population and economic development across the set of 40 SRES scenarios.</li>

      <p>The writing team recommends that the SRES scenarios be the main basis
	for the assessment of future emissions and their driving forces in the
	Third Assessment Report (TAR). Accordingly, the SRES writing team makes
	the following recommendations regarding the emissions scenarios to be
	used in the atmosphere/ocean general circulation models (A/O GCMs) simulations
	for Working Group I (WGI), for the models that will be used in the assessment
	of climate change impacts by Working Group II (WGII), and for the mitigation
	and stabilization assessments by WGIII:</p>
      <ul>
	    <li><i>It is recommended that a range of SRES scenarios from more than
	  one family be used in any analysis</i>. The scenario groups - the scenario
	  families A2, B1, and B2, plus the groups within the A1 scenario family,
	  and four cumulative emissions categories were developed as the smallest
	  subsets of SRES scenarios that capture the range of uncertainties associated
	  with driving forces and emissions.</li>
        <li><i>The important uncertainties may be different in different applications
	  - for example climate modeling; assessment of impacts, vulnerability,
	  mitigation, and adaptation options; and policy analysis</i>. Climate
	  modelers may want to cover the range reflected by the cumulative emissions
	  categories. To assess the robustness of options in terms of impacts,
	  vulnerability, and adaptation may require scenarios with similar emissions
	  but different socio-economic characteristics, as reflected by the scenario
	  groups. For mitigation analysis, variation in both emissions and socio-economic
	  characteristics may be necessary. For analysis at the national or regional
	  scale, the most appropriate scenarios may be those that best reflect
	  specific circumstances and perspectives.</li>
        <li><i>There is no single most likely, "central", or "best-guess" scenario,
	  either with respect to other SRES scenarios or to the underlying scenario
	  literature</i>. Probabilities or likelihoods are not assigned to individual
	  SRES scenarios. None of the SRES scenarios represents an estimate of
	  a central tendency for all driving forces and emissions, such as the
	  mean or median, and none should be interpreted as such. The statistics
	  associated with the frequency distributions of SRES scenarios do not
	  represent the likelihood of their occurrence. The writing team cautions
	  against constructing a central, "best-estimate" scenario from the SRES
	  scenarios; instead it recommends use of the SRES scenarios as they are.</li>
        <li><i>Concerning large-scale climate models, the writing team recommends
	  that the minimum set of SRES scenarios should include the four designated
	  marker scenarios and the two additional illustrative scenarios selected
	  from the scenario groups in the A1 family</i>. At the minimum (a) a
	  simulation for one and the same SRES marker or illustrative scenario
	  should be performed by every TAR climate model for a given stabilization
	  ceiling, and (b) the set of simulations performed by the TAR climate
	  models and stabilization runs for a given ceiling should include all
	  four of the SRES marker scenarios.</li>
        <li><i>The driving forces and emissions of each SRES scenario should be
	  used together</i>. To avoid internal inconsistencies, components of
	  SRES scenarios should not be mixed. For example, the GHG emissions from
	  one scenario and the SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions from another scenario, or the population
	  from one and economic development path from another, should not be combined.</li>
        <li><i>The SRES scenarios can provide policy makers with a long-term context
	  for near-term decisions</i>. This implies that they are not necessarily
	  well suited for the analysis of near-term developments. When analyzing
	  mitigation and adaptation options, the user should be aware that although
	  no additional climate initiatives are included in the SRES scenarios,
	  various changes have been assumed to occur that would require other
	  policy interventions.</li>
        <li><i>More detailed information on assumptions, inputs, and the results
	  of the 40 SRES scenarios should be made available at a web site and
	  on a CD-ROM</i>. Regular maintenance of the SRES web site is needed.</li>
