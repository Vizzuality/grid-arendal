<h3><a name="anc1"></a>3.5.3. Methane Emissions from Rice Production</h3>
<p>CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions from rice paddies are an important emission category, and are
  reviewed in more detail in Wassmann <i>et al</i>. (1993, 1997, 1998), Houghton
  <i>et al</i>. (1995), and Olivier <i>et al</i>. (1996). CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions are primarily
  a function of emission factors and assumed rice cropland area. In turn, emission
  factors depend on cultivation method (wet versus dry cultivation), water management
  practices, type of rice variety planted, and cropping patterns. Most long-term
  scenarios assume that the emission factor of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> per unit area of rice cropland
  remains constant with time, although estimates vary greatly from one scenario
  reference to another.</p>
<p>The many approaches used to estimate the future extent of rice fields result
  in increases in the global area of rice fields from a factor of 0.8 to one of
  1.8 by 2100 (see Alcamo and Swart, 1998, for a brief review). One of the main
  factors to affect the future area of rice cropland is the assumed long-term
  improvement in rice productivity. The typical range of estimates for this variable
  is between 1.0 and 1.6% per year, depending on the region, time horizon, and
  reference.</p>
<h3><a name="anc2"></a>3.5.4. Methane Emissions from Enteric Fermentation</h3>
<p>Estimated emissions of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> from enteric fermentation depend on assumptions
  about emission factors per animal and the number of livestock. As summarized
  by IPCC (1995), emission factors vary greatly depending on the type of cow,
  their feed regime, and their productivity. Assumptions for the change in meat
  production from 1990 to 2100 in existing scenarios vary greatly, by a factor
  of 1.2 to 4.2. Despite the wide range of assumptions about meat production,
  emissions of the various scenarios do not vary by more than a factor of two,
  which indicates that other assumptions (e.g., animal productivity) must compensate
  for the differences in assumed meat production.</p>
<p>As noted above, global estimates can mask significant differences in assumptions
  about industrial and developing regions. For industrial regions, nearly all
  scenarios assume a decline in beef production per capita, which is consistent
  with the current shift away from the consumption of beef to poultry and other
  protein sources. Meanwhile, the scenarios for developing countries assume a
  continuing increase in beef consumption, which grew by 3.1% per year between
  1982 and 1994, leading to an overall growth of 1.1% per year globally (Rosegrant
  <i>et al</i>., 1997).</p>
<p>Another factor that influences the future number of livestock is the change
  in animal productivity, that is, the weight of meat or dairy product per animal.
  The rate of increase in beef productivity dropped in industrial countries from
  1.25% per year in 1967-1982 to 0.69% in 1982-1994, but increased from 0.11%
  per year to 0.61% per year in the developing countries. Similar to emissions
  from rice fields, emissions from livestock are influenced not only by number
  of livestock (equivalent to the extent of rice area), but also by changes in
  the productivity of animals as these alter the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emission factor. </p>
<p>Some authors doubt that assumed increases in meat production and animal productivity
  can be sustained indefinitely. For example, Brown and Kane (1995) argue that
  livestock production cannot be increased greatly because nearly all of the world's
  suitable rangelands are intensively exploited already. They claim that the rapidly
  growing demand for meat and dairy products can only be met by livestock production
  in feedlots, which would result in a rising demand for feed that requires further
  development of agricultural land and further GHG emissions.</p>
<h3><a name="anc3"></a>3.5.5. Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Agriculture</h3>
<p>N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O budgets are associated with considerable uncertainties. Agricultural activities
  and animal production systems are the largest anthropogenic sources of these
  emissions. Recent calculations using IPCC 1996 revised guidelines indicate that
  N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emission from agriculture is 6.2 MtN as N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O per year (IPCC, 1996; Mosier
  <i>et al</i>., 1998). About one-third is related to direct emissions from the
  soil, another third is related to N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emission from animal waste management,
  and the final third originates from indirect N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions through ammonia (NH3),
  nitrogen oxides (NOx), and nitrate losses. This compares to earlier estimates
  of total anthropogenic emissions that range between 3.7 and 7.7 MtN (Houghton
  <i>et al</i>., 1995). Industrial sources contribute between 0.7 to 1.8 MtN (Houghton
  <i>et al</i>., 1995; see also <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="116.htm#tbl53">Table
  5-3</a> and <a href="081.htm#anc3">Section 3.6.2</a>).</p>
<p>Total natural emissions amount to 9.0 ± 3.0 MtN as N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, so oceans, tropical,
  and temperate soils are together the most important source of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O today. Atmospheric
  concentrations of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O in 1992 were 311 parts per billion (10 <sup>9</sup> )
  by volume (ppbv) (Houghton <i>et al</i>., 1995); the 1993 rate of increase was
  0.5 ppbv, somewhat lower than that in the previous decade of approximately 0.8
  ppbv per year (Houghton<i> et al</i>., 1996).</p>
<p>Among the anthropogenic sources, cultivated soils are the most important, contributing
  50 to 70% of the anthropogenic total (see <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>,
  <a href="116.htm#tbl53">Table 5-3</a>). This source of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O is particularly uncertain as the emission
  level is a complex function of soil type, soil humidity, species grown, amount
  and type of fertilizer applied, etc. The second largest anthropogenic source
  of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O is industry; two processes account for the bulk of industrial emissions
  - nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) and adipic acid production. In both cases N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O is released
  with the off-gases from the production facilities. Recently, N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O release from
  animal manure was identified as another significant source of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions.</p>
<p>N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions from agricultural soils occur through the nitrification and denitrification
  of nitrogen in soils, particularly that from mineral or organic fertilizers.
  Emissions are very dependent on local management practices, fertilizer types,
  and climatic and soil conditions, and are calculated by multiplying an emission
  factor by the sum of mineral and organic nitrogen applied as fertilizer. The
  emission factor depends on the fertilizer type and local environmental circumstances,
  and those used in IPCC (1996) result in an assumed loss of 1.25% (range 0.25
  to 2.25%) of nitrogen as N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O per year.</p>
<p>To estimate the trend in fertilizer use, different references employ different
  approaches. For example, Leggett <i>et al</i>. (1992) directly estimate the
  amount of fertilizer used, whereas Alcamo <i>et al</i>. (1996) back-calculate
  fertilizer use from the future amount of agricultural land. Despite these different
  approaches, estimates of future fertilizer use are quite consistently given
  as an increase by about a factor 1.4 to 2.8 between 1990 and 2100.</p>
<p>
  Although the different references are consistent in their findings about future
  global fertilizer use, the question arises whether these are at all reasonable
  guesses. Some researchers assume that fertilizer use will increase even more.
  For example, Kendall and Pimentel (1994) in their "business-as-usual" scenario
  assume a 300% increase in the use of nitrogen and other fertilizers by 2050.
  Moreover, most studies of future world food production assume improvements in
  crop yield. These yield improvements may imply higher overall rates of fertilizer
  use because many high-yielding crop varieties depend on large amounts of fertilizer.</p>
<p>However, some authors question whether global average fertilizer use will grow.
  For example, Brown and Kane (1995) note that world fertilizer use has actually
  fallen in recent years and Kroeze (1993) assumes that per capita N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions
  from fertilizer consumption decrease by 50% in 2100 relative to 1990 through
  policies that promote the more efficient use of synthetic fertilizers. Future
  fertilizer use may also be lower than in the "business-as-usual" scenarios because
  farmers have other incentives to reduce nitrogen fertilizer use, such as to
  reduce farming costs and avoid nitrate contamination of groundwater.</p>
<p>This brief review of the literature on prognoses of fertilizer use indicates
  that the N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emission scenarios depicted in <a href="#fig316">Figure 3-16</a>
  do not take into account the full range of views about future trends in fertilizer
  use. Additional uncertainty in future emissions occurs because changes in the
  number of livestock, as discussed above for CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions, and animal husbandry
  practices will also affect N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions.</p>
