<h1><a name="anc1"></a>3.3. Economic and Social Development</h1>
<h3><a name="anc2"></a>3.3.1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Economic and social development comprises many dimensions and a number of indicators
  have been devised to assess progress and setbacks in human development (<a href="#box31">see
  Box 3-1).</a> The UN defines development as the furthering of human choices.
  Such choices are neither finite nor static. Yet, regardless of the level of
  development, the three essential choices are to have access to the resources
  needed for a decent standard of living, to lead a long and healthy life, and
  to acquire knowledge (UNDP, 1997). Other valued choices range from political,
  economic, and social freedom to opportunities for being creative and productive,
  and to enjoy human rights (UNDP, 1997).</p>
<p>Arguably, choices are only possible once basic human needs for food, shelter,
  health care, safety, and education have been met. Poverty is therefore an important
  indicator of the absence of satisfactory economic development. Alleviation of
  poverty is an essential prerequisite for human development. Beyond the satisfaction
  of basic needs, the issue of what constitutes "development" involves many cultural,
  social, and economic dimensions that cannot be resolved by scientific methods,
  but are inherently a question of values, preferences, and policies.</p>

    <td>Writing 220 years ago in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, Adam Smith noted
      that: "whatever the soil, climate, or extent of territory of any particular
      nation, the abundance or scantiness of its annual output fundamentally depends
      on its human resources - the skill, dexterity, and judgement of its labour"
      (Smith, 1970). Although economists recognized the importance of land, labor,
      and capital in explaining economic growth and national wealth, in the post-World
      War II period national well-being has usually been measured by GDP or gross
      national product (GNP). GDP is defined as the monetary equivalent of all
      products and services generated in a given economy in a given year. GNP
      equals GDP plus the net balance of international payments to and from that
      economy. Few questions were asked about the underlying resource base for
      GDP growth and whether or not it was sustainable. Further, since GDP does
      not reflect all economic transactions it does not provide a full measure
      of human well-being. Nevertheless, GDP is very widely used because it is
      universally accepted as the monetary indicator of all products and services
      generated in a given economy within a given year.<br>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>More recently, several new approaches have been developed to address the
      inherent shortcomings of GDP measures. These include "green" national accounts
      that incorporate the role of the stocks and flows of renewable and non-renewable
      resources, and the related concept of genuine savings (UN, 1993). "Green"
      GDP is the informal name given to national income measures that are adjusted
      for the depletion of natural resources and degradation of the environment.
      The types of adjustment made to standard GDP include a measure of the user
      costs of exploiting natural resources and a value for the social costs of
      pollution emissions. In terms of measuring the sustainability of development,
      the green accounting aggregate with the most policy relevance is "genuine
      saving." This represents the value of the net change in assets that are
      important for development - produced assets, natural resources, environmental
      quality, foreign assets, and human resources, which include returns to education
      and raw labor and the strength and scope of social institutions. Human resources
      turn out, not unexpectedly, to be the dominant form of wealth in the majority
      of countries (World Bank, 1997a).<br>

      <p>A further problem arises in international comparisons, in which economic
	indicators are converted from local currencies into a common currency,
	such as dollars. Traditionally, market exchange rates are used to make
	these conversions. In theory, exchange rates adjust so that the local
	currency prices of a group of identical goods and services represent equivalent
	value in every nation. In practice, such adjustments can lag far behind
	changing economic circumstances. Policies, such as currency controls,
	may further distort the accuracy of market-based rates. Moreover, many
	goods and services are not traded internationally so market-based exchange
	rates may not reflect the relative values of such goods and services,
	even in theory. An alternative approach is based on estimates of the purchasing
	power of different currencies. The International Comparison Project compared
	prices for several hundred goods and services in a large number of countries.
	On the basis of this comparison, the relative values of local currencies
	are adjusted to reflect PPP (see UNDP, 1993). In effect, the PPP currency
	values reflect the number of units of a country's currency required to
	buy the same quantity of comparable goods and services in the local market
	as one US dollar would buy in an "average" country. The average country
	is based on a composite of all participating countries. In 1996 the World
	Bank initiated the ranking of countries by GDP converted at PPP rates;
	the effect was to reduce the income spread between the poorest and richest
	countries (WRI, 1997a).</p>

      <p>The UN has tried to address the shortcomings of GDP by developing <i>The
	Human Development Index</i> (UNDP, 1997). This index, produced since 1990,
	combines three factors to measure overall development:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Income as measured by real GDP per capita at PPP to represent command
	  over resources to enjoy a decent standard of living.</li>
	<li>Longevity as measured by life expectancy at birth.</li>
	<li>Educational attainment as measured by adult literacy and school enrolment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The UN has also developed other measures, such as the Gender-related
	Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) to assess
	conditions such as gender equality.</p>
      <p>The difficulty of incorporating these alternative measures into long-term
	scenarios is that, with the exception of life expectancy, underlying data
	or base projections (e.g. on future PPPs, levels of educational attainment,
	etc.) needed to develop these alternative indicators for future projections
	are not available. Therefore, this report largely focuses on traditional
	measures of economic development like GDP. Projections of PPPs are calculated
	by one of the six SRES models and are presented in <a href="089.htm">Chapter
	4</a>.</p>

<p>Given the inherent ambiguities of such a complex, multidimensional issue, it
  is easiest to define and develop indicators of no development. Estimates indicate,
  for instance, that 1.3 billion people in developing countries live on incomes
  of less than US$1 (PPP based) per day, a level used to define the absolute poverty
  cut-off in international comparisons (UNDP, 1997). An equal number of people
  are estimated to have no access to safe drinking water (UNDP, 1997) and 2 billion
  people are estimated to have no access to services provided by the use of modern
  energy forms (WEC, 1993).</p>
<p>Income is not an end in itself, but a way to enable human choices, or to foreclose
  them in the case of poverty. Therefore, levels of per capita income (GDP or
  GNP) have been widely used as a measure of the degree of economic development,
  as in many instances such levels correlate closely (as lead or lag indicator)
  with other indicators and dimensions of social development, such as mortality,
  nutrition, and access to basic services, etc. Average income values also do
  not indicate the distribution of income, which is an important quantity. Composite
  measures, such as the UN Human Development Index, are also used in historical
  analyses (<a href="#box31">see Box 3-1</a>). Note, however, that the overall
  nature of scenario results may not vary much even if some other measure could
  be used, because often-used components, such as literacy rates, are generally
  correlated with income levels.</p>
<p>In fact, per capita income is <i>the</i> (and often only) development indicator
  used in the literature for long-term energy and GHG emissions scenarios. This
  explains why this review chapter, while recognizing the importance of alternative
  dimensions and indicators to describe long-term human development, almost exclusively
  embraces an economic perspective.</p>
<p>
  The widespread use of GDP or GNP per capita (however measured) should not distract
  from the fact that, while a powerful indicator, it does not describe all aspects
  of economic development (<a href="057.htm#box31">see Box 3-1</a>). GDP and GNP
  are indicators of financial flows (<a href="057.htm#box31">see Box 3-1</a>),
  and are not designed to measure stock variables such as the size of the capital
  stock in an economy. GDP and GNP relate only to goods and services that are
  subject to market transactions, that is only those activities that are part
  of the formal economy. Subsistence and other "gray" economic activities and
  socially important obligatory activities, such as childcare or household work,
  are not included; also, depletion allowances for natural capital and resources
  are not considered.</p>
<p>Although PPP comparison (<a href="057.htm#box31">see Box 3-1</a>) is considered
  a valid indicator of relative wealth, it is sometimes quite uncertain and dependent
  on detailed comparison exercises. As a result, even if studies and scenarios
  consistently use the same indicator of economic development, numeric values
  are often not directly comparable because of large differences in base-year
  values. Comparison of growth rates are more robust, but even here many difficulties
  exist (see, e.g., Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1995, and <a href="034.htm">Chapter
  2</a>).</p>
