<p>1<a name="1"></a>. Emission trajectories of these ozone-depleting substances
  (ODSs) are not developed by the SRES team, but adopted from WMO/UNEP (1998).</p>
<p>2<a name="2"></a>. During the approval process of the Summary for Policymakers
  at the 5th Session of Working Group III (WGIII) of the IPCC from 8 to 11 March
  2000 in Katmandu, Nepal, it was decided to combine the A1C and A1G groups into
  one "fossil intensive" group A1FI in contrast to the non-fossil group A1T, and
  to select two illustrative scenarios from these two A1 groups to facilitate
  use by modelers and policy makers. This leads to six scenario groups that constitute
  the four scenario families, three of which are in the A1 family. All scenarios
  are equally sound. </p>
<p>3<a name="3"></a>. In particular, the IPCC Working Group I (WGI) Second Assessment
  Report (SAR) GWPs are calculated for constant concentrations. In long-term scenarios,
  concentrations may change significantly, as do GWP values. It is unclear how
  to apply GWPs to long-term scenarios in a meaningful manner. In addition, the
  GWP approach is not applicable to gases such as SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and ozone precursors.</p>
<p>4<a name="4"></a>. Note that unless stated otherwise cumulative emissions reported
  in this chapter always refer to total carbon, while annual emissions in this
  section refer to energy and industry emissions only.</p>
<p>5<a name="5"></a>. The IMAGE results for the A2 and B2 scenarios are based
  on preliminary model experiments carried out in March 1998. As a result of limited
  resources it has not been possible to re-run these experiments. Hence, unlike
  for the IMAGE A1 and B1 scenarios, the IMAGE team has not been able to provide
  background data and details for these scenario calculations and the population
  and economic growth assumptions are not harmonized fully.</p>
<p>6<a name="6"></a>. The IMAGE results for the A2 and B2 scenarios are based
  on preliminary model experiments carried out in March 1998. As a result of limited
  resources it has not been possible to re-run these experiments. Hence, unlike
  for the IMAGE A1 and B1 scenarios, the IMAGE team has not been able to provide
  background data and details for these scenario calculations and the population
  and economic growth assumptions are not harmonized fully.</p>
<p>7<a name="7"></a>. The most comprehensive treatment is embedded in the IMAGE
  model. For the sake of comparison the IMAGE team has made a tentative estimate
  of those (net) emissions that are reasonably consistent with what other models
  reported. These derived values are used in this report.</p>
<p>8<a name="8"></a>. For the A1G-MiniCAM scenario emissions from congruent model
  runs derived from other models have been estimated.</p>
<p>9<a name="9"></a>. Following UN energy statistics and IPCC inventory practices,
  international bunker fuels are included in global totals, but not in national/regional
  subtotals (and their aggregates to global totals). Hence, bunker fuels are reported
  separately here.</p>
<p>10<a name="10"></a>. To convert into SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> , a unit frequently used in the sulfur
  scenario literature, multiply the MtS numbers by 2.</p>
<p>11<a name="11"></a>. All emissions coefficients were calculated with the MESSAGE
  model.</p>
<p>12<a name="12"></a>. In this report represented by four macro-regions - OECD90,
  REF, ASIA, and ALM.</p>
<p>13<a name="13"></a>. The numbers of the two additional illustrative scenarios
  for the A1FI and A1T scenario groups can be found in <a href="145.htm" target="_blank">Appendix</a>
  VII.</p>
