<h1>3.1. Introduction<a name="anc1"></a></h1>
<p>Some of the major driving forces of past and future anthropogenic greenhouse
  gas (GHG) emissions, which include demographics, economics, resources, technology,
  and (non-climate) policies, are reviewed in this chapter. Economic, social,
  and technical systems and their interactions are highly complex and only a limited
  overview is provided in this chapter. The discussion of major scenario driving
  forces herein is structured by considering the links from demography and the
  economy to resource use and emissions. A frequently used approach to organize
  discussion of the drivers of emissions is through the so-called IPAT identity,
  equation (3.1).</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <i>Impact = Population � Affluence � Technology</i> (3.1)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The IPAT identity states that environmental impacts (e.g., emissions) are the
  product of the level of population times affluence (income per capita, i.e.
  gross domestic product (GDP) divided by population) times the level of technology
  deployed (emissions per unit of income). The IPAT identity has been widely discussed
  in analyses of energy-related carbon dioxide (CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> ) emissions (e.g., Ogawa, 1991;
  Parikh <i>et al</i>., 1991; Nakicenovic <i>et al</i>., 1993; Parikh, 1994;
  Alcamo <i>et al</i>., 1995; Gaffin and O'Neill, 1997; G�rer and Ban, 1997; O'Neill
  <i>et al</i>., 2000), in which it is often referred to as the Kaya identity
  (Kaya, 1990), equation (3.2).</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> Emissions = Population � (GDP/Population) � (Energy/GDP) � (CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> /Energy)</i> (3.2)</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>The Kaya multiplicative identity also underlies the analysis of the emissions
  scenario literature (<a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a>). It can be broken down
  into further subcomponents. For instance, the energy component can be decomposed
  into fossil and non-fossil shares, and emissions can be expressed as carbon
  emissions per unit of fossil energy, as shown in <a href="#fig31">Figure 3-1</a>
  (G�rer and Ban, 1997). A property of the multiplicative identity is that component
  growth rates are additive. For instance, global energy-related CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions
  since the middle of the 19 th century are estimated to have increased by approximately
  1.7% per year (Watson <i>et al</i>., 1996). This growth rate can be decomposed
  roughly into a 3% growth in gross world product (the sum of a 1% growth in population
  and a 2% growth in per capita income) minus a 1% per year decline in the energy
  intensity of world GDP (the third term in equation (3.2)) and a decline in the
  carbon intensity of primary energy (the fourth term) of 0.3% per year (Nakicenovic
  <i>et al</i>., 1993; Watson <i>et al</i>., 1996).</p>
<p>While the Kaya identity above can be used to organize discussion of the primary
  driving forces of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions and, by extension, emissions of other GHGs,
  there are important caveats. Most important, the four terms on the right-hand
  side of equation (3.2) should be considered neither as fundamental driving forces
  in themselves, nor as generally independent from each other.</p>
<p>Global analysis is often not instructive and even misleading, because of the
  great heterogeneity among populations with respect to GHG emissions. The ratios
  of per capita emissions of the world's richest countries to those of its poorest
  countries approach several hundred (Parikh<i> et al</i>., 1991; Engelman, 1994).
  Of course, some level of aggregation is necessary. In practice, the models used
  to produce emissions scenarios in this report, for example, operate on the basis
  of 9-15 regions (see <a href="150.htm">Appendix IV</a>, <a href="150.htm#tblIV1">Table IV-1</a>). This
  level of detail isolates the most important differences, particularly with respect
  to industrial versus developing countries (Lutz, 1993).</p>
<p>The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of emission growth that becomes masked
  in the global aggregates is shown in <a href="#fig31">Figure 3-1</a>, in which
  the growth in energy-related CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions since 1970 is broken down into a
  number of subcomponents. For industrial countries the population growth has
  been modest and their emissions have evolved roughly in line with increases
  (or declines) in economic activity. For developing countries both population
  and income growth appear as important drivers of emissions. However, even in
  developing countries the regional heterogeneity becomes masked in the aggregate
  analysis (Gr�bler <i>et al</i>., 1993a).</p>
<p>Although, at face value, the IPAT and Kaya identities suggest that CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions
  grow linearly with population increases, this depends on the real (or modeled)
  interactions between demographics and economic growth (see <a href="051.htm">Section
  3.2</a>) as well as on those between technology, economic structure, and affluence
  (<a href="057.htm">Section 3.3</a>). In principle, such interactions preclude
  a simple linear interpretation of the role of population growth in emissions.</p>
<p>Demographic development interacts in many ways with social and economic development.
  Fertility and mortality trends depend, among other things, on education, income,
  social norms, and health provisions. In turn, these determine the size and age
  composition of the population. Many of these factors combined are recognized
  as necessary to explain long-run productivity, economic growth, economic structure,
  and technological change (Barro, 1997). In turn, long-run per capita economic
  growth and structural change are closely linked with advances in knowledge and
  technological change. In fact, long-run growth accounts (e.g., Solow, 1956;
  Denison, 1962, 1985; Maddison, 1989, 1995; Barro and Sala-I-Martin, 1995) confirm
  that advances in knowledge and technology may be the most important reason for
  long-run economic growth; more important even than growth in other factors of
  production such as capital and labor. Abramovitz (1993) demonstrates that capital
  and labor productivity cannot be treated as independent from technological change.
  Therefore, it is not possible to treat the affluence and technology variables
  in IPAT as independent of each other.</p>
<p>Pollution abatement efforts appear to increase with income, growing willingness
  to pay for a clean environment, and progress in the development of clean technology.
  Thus, as incomes rise, pollution should increase initially and later decline,
  a relationship often referred to as the "environmental Kuznets curve." This
  process seems well established for traditional pollutants, such as particulates
  and sulfur (e.g., World Bank, 1992; Kato, 1996; Viguier, 1999), and there have
  been some claims that it might apply to GHG emissions. Schmalensee <i>et al</i>.
  (1998) found that CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions have flattened and may have reversed for highly
  developed economies such as the US and Japan. Other researchers argue that the
  Kuznets curve does not apply to GHG emissions (Pearce, 1995; Galeotti and Lanza,
  1999, Viguier, 1999). The flattening in emissions can be explained by normal
  market processes and does not appear to result from a willingness to pay to
  protect the global environment. Urbanization, infrastructure, poverty, and income
  distribution are other factors in the complex interplay between population,
  economy, and environment (see, e.g., Rotmans and de Vries, 1997; de Vries <i>et
  al</i>., 1999; O'Neill <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Technological, economic, and social innovation have long been means by which
  a greater number of people can live from the same environmental resources. The
  best known historical examples of major periods of innovation include the Neolithic
  revolution (beginnings of organized agriculture from around 10,000 years ago);
  and the industrial revolution that began two centuries ago (Rosenberg and Birdzell,
  1986). In each case, changes in patterns of primary production (food, energy,
  materials) are linked to changes in social organization, institutions, economy,
  and technology (e.g., Mumford, 1934; Campbell, 1959; Landes, 1969; Hill, 1975;
  Wilber, 1981; Buchanan, 1992; Reynolds and Cutcliffe, 1997). The most remarkable
  change in recent decades is the so-called demographic transition, which has
  led to a stabilization of population in many parts of the world. No single one
  of these changes can be considered as the primary driver, and they cannot be
  considered as independent from each other: each play a role in an interconnected
  system.</p>
<p>
  Most innovative efforts in the past two centuries were devoted to improving
  labor productivity and the human ability to harness resources for economic purposes.
  While material and energy efficiency improved slowly, economic growth was faster
  and thus aggregate resource use increased.</p>
<p>Finally, and importantly, the high uncertainty with regard to the nature and
  extent of the relationships between driving forces of GHG emissions means that,
  with current knowledge, it is not possible to develop probabilistic future emission
  scenarios. Even if it were possible to derive (subjective) probability distributions
  of the future evolution of individual scenario driving-force variables (like
  population, economic growth, or technological change), the nature of their relationships
  is known only qualitatively at best or remains uncertain (and controversial)
  in many instances. </p>
<p>The next five sections review the major driving forces of GHG emissions within
  the IPAT identity. <a href="051.htm">Section 3.2</a> discusses the role
  of population, <a href="057.htm">Section 3.3</a> addresses economic and
  social development processes (including technological change), <a href="066.htm">Section
  3.4</a> examines energy resources and technology in more detail, and <a href="076.htm">Section
  3.5</a> addresses agriculture, forestry, and land-use change. <a href="081.htm">Section 3.6</a> considers
  other sources of non-CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> GHGs. The chapter concludes with a discussion of non-climate
  policies and their potential impact on the principal driving forces of future
  emissions. Each section briefly reviews past trends, available scenarios, and
  important new methodological and empirical advances since the publication of
  previous International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emissions scenarios in
  1992 (IS92). This chapter provides the background to establish recommendations
  for the range of driving-force variables to be explored in the new set of scenarios.
  The available literature and current understanding of the inherent uncertainties
  in developing very long-term scenarios are reflected. Each section elucidates
  in detail the important relationships between scenario driving forces, as the
  question of relationships is a new and important mandate for SRES. Nonetheless,
  most attention is paid to the possible relationships between population and
  economic growth, because this is the area most intensively discussed in the
  literature.</p>
