<h3>3.7.2. Policy Areas<a name="anc3"></a></h3>
<h4>3.7.2.1. Population and Social Welfare Policies<a name="anc4"></a></h4>
<p>Given the interactions between demographics and social and economic development
  discussed in Sections <a href="051.htm#anc1">3.2</a> and <a href="057.htm#anc1">3.3</a>,
  population and social welfare policies that currently exist or are options for
  various countries can also be viewed as "non-climate" policies (in the sense
  that they are not motivated by climate concerns, but will affect future GHG
  emissions). Studies support the notion that reduced population growth significantly
  abates GHG emissions. Indeed, some integrated assessment models suggest that
  emissions scenarios may be more sensitive to population changes, with respect
  to normalized uncertainty analysis, than to other factors that affect emissions
  (Nordhaus, 1993). Therefore, social policies that affect fertility rates (and
  mortality and migration rates) also could have a significant impact on future
  emissions. By the same token, demographic policies for health and education
  may also affect productivity growth in a positive manner. Thus, the desirable
  objective to further development may result in higher economic growth, consumption,
  and emissions per capita. The overall effects are likely to vary from country
  to country.</p>
<p>For instance, efforts can be made to help women avoid unwanted pregnancies
  or to reduce infant mortality. Demographic health surveys suggest that more
  than 100 million women in less developed countries do not want to become pregnant,
  but they do not practice contraception (Bongaarts, 1994). The Cairo Program
  of Action (UN, 1995) estimates that US$17 billion annually would successfully
  deliver family planning and reproductive health services to the majority of
  people in developing countries who desire them. Family planning assistance today
  contributes to the observed recent declines in fertility rates in many developing
  countries. In one study, it was estimated that such programs over the past two
  decades reduced the present population by about 40 million persons, which in
  itself may reduce future population levels by some 400 million people in the
  year 2100 (Bongaarts <i>et al</i>., 1990).</p>
<p>Other policy measures are less direct, but also exert important influences
  on fertility rates. These include improvements in health care and female education,
  especially primary school education, which is a factor that correlates highly
  with fertility rates in young women (Bongaarts, 1994). Similarly, measures that
  improve gender equality reduce fertility rates as they encourage non-maternal
  roles and increase employment and empowerment opportunities for women. Their
  implementation is currently unrelated to concerns about global warming, yet
  their effect on this environmental issue may be significant.</p>
<h4><a name="anc5"></a>3.7.2.2. Policies that Target Economic Development and Technological Innovation</h4>
<p>A wide range of policies and circumstances may contribute toward the desirable
  objective of furthering development and economic growth (see <a href="057.htm#anc1">Section
  3.3</a>). In the short term, fiscal, monetary, and interest rate management
  policies are among the main instruments used by governments. In the longer term,
  economic growth may be affected more by measures that influence fundamental
  capabilities, such as policies in education, and in the development of physical
  infrastructure, social and economic institutions, and national systems for innovation.</p>
<p>As emphasized in Sections <a href="057.htm#anc1">3.3</a> and <a href="066.htm#anc1">3.4</a>,
  the effects of economic growth on GHG emissions depend on economic structure
  and technology. Governments generally aim to encourage the development of particular
  sectors that are perceived to contribute to national goals for security, food
  and energy supply, high employment, and long-term economic growth (Maddison,
  1995). The encouragement may take many forms, such as direct subsidies and protection
  from foreign competition, public investment in infrastructure, training, or
  R&D, and support for collaborative development programs and information networks
  (OECD, 1997a). If governments support sectors that are fossil-fuel intensive,
  the tendency to increase GHG emissions is clear. However, protectionist policies
  may also reduce national economic efficiency, which dampens income growth and
  tends to restrict growth in GHG emissions. Conversely, if governments support
  the development of rapid-growth sectors, the tendency may be to promote long-term
  economic growth, increase household income and consumption, and hence increase
  GHG emissions.</p>
<p>Over a period of 100 years the policies that most influence the development
  of GHG emissions are probably those that contribute to the processes of technical
  and social innovation, which themselves contribute to economic development.
  Innovation policies mostly emphasize the development of technologies that improve
  international competitiveness with new products and improved performance or
  reduced costs of existing products. The policies are not usually designed to
  achieve these and other (e.g., environmental and social) objectives in an integrated
  way (OECD, 1998b). Hence, their impact on GHG emissions is hard to predict,
  but as currently constituted many national systems for innovation could tend
  to increase emissions by stimulating economic growth.</p>
<h4><a name="anc1"></a>3.7.2.3. Energy, Agriculture and Other Resource Management Policies</h4>
<p>Government policies on energy and agriculture have, on the whole, paralleled
  global trends during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Early in the century there was a move
  toward protectionism, which aimed to secure national self-sufficiency, especially
  in food and energy. Governments established import quotas and tariffs, subsidies
  for domestic production, and research and investment programs to improve agricultural
  productivity and develop new energy sources. During the 1980s policy emphasis
  shifted in many countries, and has continued into the 1990s, toward open borders
  and reduced subsidies and R&D. Nonetheless, numerous energy and agricultural
  policies persist that influence production and trade patterns and hence also
  GHG emissions.</p>
<h5>3.7.2.3.1. Energy policies<a name="anc2"></a></h5>
<p>Various policies exist to promote energy efficiency and the adoption of energy-efficient
  technologies and practices. Government standards, such as appliance efficiency
  standards, motors standards, and the automobile fuel economy standards in the
  US, prescribe the energy consumption levels of particular commodities. Residential
  and commercial building standards require the use of energy-efficient construction
  practices and components. Information dissemination programs, such as the Green
  Lights program in the USA or similar programs in other countries, provide consumers
  with the information required to make purchase decisions as well as to install
  and operate energy-efficient equipment. Subsidy or investment credit programs
  are often used to promote the adoption of a particular technology; combined
  heat and power was promoted in The Netherlands through such a program in the
  1980s (Farla and Blok, 1995). Other energy efficiency policies or programs include
  audits and assessments, rebate programs, government procurement programs, benchmarking
  programs, labeling programs, and technology demonstration programs (Worrell
  <i>et al</i>., 1997).</p>
<p>Many reports point to government subsidies as a major impediment to cleaner
  production of energy (Burniaux <i>et al</i>., 1992; Larsen and Shah, 1992; de
  Moor and Calamai, 1996; Roodman, 1996; Greenpeace, 1997). In addition to direct
  subsidies, governments use a wide variety of measures to support domestic or
  regional industries, or to protect legal monopolies. These policies inhibit
  innovation and can lead to higher levels of pollution or resource intensity
  than would occur in a less constrained market. A recent OECD study found that
  reform of supports to coal, electricity, and transport could substantially reduce
  CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> and acid rain emissions in some countries (OECD, 1997a). In other countries,
  subsidy reform would have minimal direct environmental benefits, but would increase
  the effectiveness or reduce the cost of environmental policies such as eco-taxes
  and emission limits. Where subsidies support nuclear power or other non-fossil
  energy sources, their reform could conversely lead to increased GHG emissions.
  Energy taxes also have an important influence on energy demand and hence GHG
  emissions. The majority of energy taxes are intended as a pure fiscal instrument
  or, in the case of road fuel taxes in some countries, to raise funds for road
  provision and maintenance. Many countries are raising these taxes, or considering
  doing so.</p>
<h5>3.7.2.3.2. Agriculture policies<a name="anc3"></a></h5>
<p>Agricultural policy reform has received more attention than energy policy reform
  in recent years. Most OECD countries support domestic agriculture, whether through
  direct subsidies, import tariffs, or price controls. The general trend is toward
  a reduction in these supports, in part as a result of trade negotiations, but
  also as part of the broader trend toward policies that reduce budget deficits
  and improve market efficiency. Supports are also being reformed to reduce their
  linkage to production volumes. Where subsidies are linked to the volume of production,
  they provide an incentive to increase output beyond the level of demand, which
  leads to surpluses. This incentive may tend to increase GHG emissions as a result
  of soil carbon depletion and oxidation, excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer
  leading to N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions, and over-intensive animal farming that results in
  excess CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions from manure and from the animals themselves (OECD, 1997b;
  Storey, 1997). The overall impact of agriculture subsidy reforms on GHG emissions
  will depend on associated fiscal changes in other parts of the economy.</p>
<p>Overproduction in one country may be compensated to some extent by lower production
  elsewhere. However, in general, incentives for higher agricultural output are
  likely to lead to more production globally, with a shift from consumption of
  plant products to animal products, which are land-, resource-, and GHG-intensive.
  In a few industrialized countries a small trend has developed to support organic
  farming and regional marketing of foods. Future policies may thus lead to agricultural
  subsidies that are linked more to ecological and social factors than to the
  volume of production.</p>
<h5>3.7.2.3.3. Dematerialization policies<a name="anc4"></a></h5>
<p>GHG emissions are likely to be reduced by other policies for the sustainable
  use of resources, such as land, forest ecosystems, mineral resources, water,
  and soil. Instruments may include direct planning, regulations, establishing
  property rights and obligations, information, education, and persuasion, and
  a broad range of policies to support or influence the innovation process to
  encourage dematerialization (OECD, 1998b).</p>
<h4>3.7.2.4. Environmental Policies<a name="3-7-2-4"></a></h4>
<p>While environmental objectives often form part of the rationale for agriculture
  and energy policy reforms, many instruments are focused entirely on environmental
  objectives. The most obvious of these are pollution regulations and standards,
  eco-taxes, and voluntary and other measures.</p>
<p>In the context of non-mitigation GHG emission scenarios, probably the most
  important environmental policies are those related to sulfur emissions (see
  <a href="071.htm">Section 3.4.3</a>). Sulfur emissions are controlled for
  local and regional environmental reasons, but sulfur oxides do have a radiative
  impact, and sulfur controls can lead to the switching of fuel away from coal
  and oil. Thus, almost paradoxically, environmental policies to combat urban
  air pollution and acid rain may (via reduced sulfate aerosol "cooling") exacerbate
  climate change. Most sulfur control policies to date have involved either regulations
  that limit the concentration of sulfur oxides in flue gas from large combustion
  plants, or give standards for the sulfur content of fuel. Recently, sulfur control
  policies have become more sophisticated, and aim to limit aggregate emissions
  on a national or regional basis to minimize acidic deposition in a trans-national
  context. New policy instruments have also been introduced. The USA has pioneered
  a "cap and trade" system with tradable emission permits (for a review see Joskow
  <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>Other environmental policies with a greenhouse impact include controls on ODSs;
  urban air pollution precursor compounds (CO, NO<sub>x</sub>, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, and NMVOCs), especially
  from transport and domestic solid fuels; and controls on agricultural practice
  to reduce water pollution and soil erosion. Policies in all of these areas are
  likely to contribute to GHG mitigation. However, some options, such as an accelerated
  shift to electric vehicles to reduce local air pollution, could result in higher
  GHG emissions in the short term in certain circumstances (Michaelis <i>et al</i>.,
  1996).</p>
<h4>3.7.2.5. Transportation and Infrastructure Policies<a name="anc6"></a></h4>
<p>Policies on infrastructure may have a very long-term influence on GHG emissions.
  although in many cases the causal relationships are complex and not understood
  well enough to justify quantitative analyses of the policy options. These include
  urban planning guidance, construction regulations, policies on ownership and
  financing of infrastructure, and user pricing for roads and parking. The most
  significant impacts on GHG emissions are likely to derive from policies that
  influence demand for travel by car and for freight transport by truck (Newman
  and Kenworthy, 1990; Michaelis <i>et al</i>., 1996; Watson<i> et al</i>., 1996),
  those that influence energy use in buildings (Levine <i>et al</i>., 1996; Watson
  <i>et al</i>., 1996), and those that influence the conversion of forest for
  agriculture, or agricultural land for urban development.</p>
<h3>3.7.3. Quantification of Impacts and Implementation of Policies in SRES<a name="anc7"></a></h3>
<p>Few of the policies and instruments identified above can be represented directly
  in the models typically used to produce GHG emission scenarios. In general,
  the impacts of policies are highly uncertain (Houghton <i>et al</i>., 1996).
  Price-based instruments have been analyzed in greater detail than other types
  of measure, and many empirical studies have been carried out to determine the
  response to price changes of demand for various commodities, especially energy.
  However, such research and analysis usually yields very large ranges of uncertainty
  in the magnitude of the price response, and often reveals a strong dependence
  on specific circumstances. Even for price-based policies, national and global
  effects over 20-100 years are very uncertain. For the SRES, it is not possible
  to make a precise link between governments' application of specific policies
  and the outcome in the various scenarios.</p>
<p>Instead, the qualitative SRES scenario storylines give a broad characterization
  of the areas of policy emphasis thought to be associated with particular economic,
  technological, and environmental outcomes, as reflected in alternative scenario
  assumptions in the models used to generate long-term GHG emission scenarios.
  In some selected areas, such as sulfur control policies, a wide body of literature
  can be drawn upon to derive specific pollution control levels or maximum emission
  trajectories consistent with a particular interpretation of a scenario storyline.
  In other areas, such as GHG gases controlled by the Montreal Protocol, existing
  scenarios that reflect the most up-to-date information are used as direct input
  to SRES.</p>
