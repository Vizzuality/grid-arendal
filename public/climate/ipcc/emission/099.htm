<p>For the SRES scenario quantification three different population trajectories
  were chosen to reflect future demographic uncertainties based on published population
  projections (Lutz, 1996; UN, 1998; see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Global
  population ranges between 7 and 15 billion people by 2100 (<a href="#fig45">Figure
  4-5</a>) depending on the speed and extent of the demographic transition. Fertility
  rates were assumed to converge to replacement levels (UN, 1998 medium scenario)
  in the B2 scenario or to below replacement levels in the A1 and B1 scenario
  families that adopt a variant of the low population scenario of Lutz (1996).
  The A2 scenario family is based on the high population projection described
  in Lutz (1996), which is characterized by heterogeneous fertility patterns that
  remain above replacement levels in many regions but nonetheless decline compared
  to current levels.</p>
<p>Across all scenarios, the concentration of future population growth and its
  uncertainty lies primarily in the developing countries. An equally pervasive
  trend across all scenarios is urbanization (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Since the population
  trajectories are exogenous input to all the models used for this report, and
  are subject to a stringent harmonization criterion across different models,
  no further demographic variants to these are reported here, with exception of
  the A2 scenario family<a href="fn5.htm#16" onClick="showFootnote(5,16); return false;"><sup>16</sup></a>.</p>
<h4>4.4.3.1. A1 and B1 Scenarios<a name="4431"></a></h4>
<p>The population trajectory assumed for the A1 and B1 scenario families is based
  on a variant of the low population projection reported in Lutz (1996), which
  combines low fertility with low mortality and central migration rate assumptions.
  As is the case for other population scenarios used in this report, it is well
  within the uncertainty ranges as discussed in the demographic literature and
  the UN (1998) long-range population projections. After peaking at 8.7 billion
  in the middle of the 21 st century, world population declines to 7.1 billion
  in the year 2100 (for comparison, the lowest UN Long Range projection indicates
  5.6 billion by 2100; UN, 1998). As discussed in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>,
  the scenario population is somewhat higher than the previous low population
  scenario used in the IS92 scenario series, as only a combination of low fertility
  with high mortality rates could result in a global population as low as six
  billion people by 2100. Such a development is judged to be inconsistent with
  demographic theory (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>) and to be inconsistent
  with the scenario storylines (see <a href="091.htm">Section 4.2</a>).</p>
<p>The pace of demographic transition in developing countries is fastest among
  all the SRES scenarios, reflecting the emphasis on social and educational development
  (scenario B1) and economic development (A1). The use of the same population
  projection for two SRES scenario families thus reflects different views of the
  driving forces of the demographic transition (with causality links in both directions),
  but it does not imply that such a demographic scenario is considered more likely
  compared to that of other projections. Better education and unproved social
  development, in particular concerning the role of women in society, lead the
  demographic transition (and consequently also economic development) in scenario
  B1. Accelerated rates of economic development and its required favorable social
  environment (education, reduction of income disparities, etc.) in turn lead
  the demographic transition in scenario A1. In both scenarios, low (infant) mortality
  rates are a necessary precondition to lower fertility rates (consistent with
  the Cairo targets of the UN Conference on Population and Development, discussed
  in <a href="034.htm">Chapter 2</a>). A distinguishing feature of the IIASA low
  population projection is the assumption of below replacement fertility levels,
  on the basis of the actual experience of industrial countries<a href="fn5.htm#17" onClick="showFootnote(5,17); return false;"><sup>17</sup></a>.
  The implications of this trend are visible in both the absolute decline of global
  population (from its peak at 8.7 billion people in the middle of the 21 st century)
  and the significant population aging. In the long-term this trend affects not
  only the industrialized countries but also the currently developing countries
  (see the discussion in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>).</p>
<p>For A1 and B1 scenarios, regional population trajectories are (almost for all
  years) within the proposed 5% interval of their respective marker scenarios,
  except for two of the scenarios<a href="fn5.htm#18" onClick="showFootnote(5,18); return false;"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>
<h4>4.4.3.2. A2 Scenarios<a name="4432"></a></h4>
<p>For the A2 scenario family, future population levels are based on the high
  scenario (15 billion) reported in Lutz (1996)<a href="fn5.htm#19" onClick="showFootnote(5,19); return false;"><sup>19</sup></a>,
  which is somewhat lower than the high population projection used in the previous
  IS92 scenarios (17.6 billion by 2100) for the reasons outlined in <a href="049.htm">Chapter
  3</a>. The A2 population trajectory is the highest among the SRES scenarios,
  but well within the range of the UN long-range population projections<a href="fn5.htm#20" onClick="showFootnote(5,20); return false;"><sup>20</sup></a>
  and corresponding uncertainties estimated by demographers (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter
  3</a>). For instance, Lutz et al. (1997) attach a probability of about 90% that
  actual world population will be lower (and 10% that it will be higher) than
  the value adopted for the A2 scenario family. Thus, the scenario represents
  well an upper bound of population growth scenarios found in the current scenario
  literature, although higher population scenarios exist in the demographic literature
  (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>). As mentioned above, the SRES writing
  team is not in a position to attach any judgment concerning probability or likelihood
  to this or to any other demographic scenario. Population growth in the A2 world
  remains uninterrupted across all the SRES regions (<a href="#fig45">Figure 4-5</a>).
  The average global population growth rate over the 21st century is 0.96% per
  year, half that observed during the period between 1950 and 1990 (1.86%; UN,
  1998). In the A2 marker, fertility rates vary considerably from one region to
  another; this reflects the regional orientation toward specific values, lifestyles,
  etc. described in the A2 scenario storyline (see <a href="093.htm">Section 4.3</a>).
  In the A2 world, in the year 2100 less than one-tenth of the world population
  lives in OECD90 countries, and toward the end of the 21st century a pronounced
  shift occurs in the population distribution, from ASIA to the ALM region (specifically
  Africa).</p>
<h4><a name="4433"></a>4.4.3.3. Harmonized and Other A2 Scenarios</h4>
<p>The A2 scenarios share, with one exception, the same global population trajectory,
  but some of them show variation in population across the four SRES regions because
  of differences in the regional breakdown of the underlying models. For example,
  the A2-IMAGE scenario has a smaller population in the REF region as compared
  with the marker, 405 million versus 706 million in the marker. An alternative
  demographic interpretation at the global level was attempted in the "transitional"
  A2-A1-MiniCAM scenario, in which the implications of delayed development patterns
  are explored. In this scenario global population is assumed to reach 10 billion
  by 2050, and 12 billion by 2100 (see <a href="101.htm#box46">Box 4-6</a>).</p>
<h4>4.4.3.4. B2 Scenarios<a name="4434"></a></h4>
<p>The B2 marker scenario adopted the UN median 1998 population projection (UN,
  1998), wherein global population increases to about 9.4 billion people by 2050
  and to about 10.4 billion by 2100<a href="fn5.htm#21" onClick="showFootnote(5,21); return false;"><sup>21</sup></a>.
  The scenario is characteristic of recent median global population projections
  (see discussion in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>), and describes a continuation
  of historical trends toward a completion of the demographic transition in the
  21st century. The projection is consistent with recent demographic data and
  scenarios; it reflects faster declines in world fertility together with declining
  mortality rates. Hence, the scenario is somewhat lower than previous UN median
  projections, as used in the previous IS92 scenario series. A distinguishing
  feature of the UN population projections is the assumption that, in the long-term,
  fertility levels converge toward replacement levels globally (see <a href="049.htm">Chapter
  3</a>). Future population growth is assumed to be slow in today's industrialized
  countries. In Asia, population size stabilizes in the second half of the 21st
  century, and in the rest of the world population growth slows down toward the
  end of that century.</p>
<p>The UN median population projection is shared across all B2 scenario quantifications,
  although differences remain at the regional level. The different regional aggregations
  used across various models did not coincide with the regional aggregation of
  the original UN projection, which suggests that a more detailed regional breakdown
  of demographic projections is highly desirable for long-term global scenario
  studies.</p>
