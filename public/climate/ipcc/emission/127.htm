<p>Sulfur emission trajectories in all the A2 family scenarios, except A2-A1-MiniCAM
  with its much lower energy consumption, have the same general convex shape (<a href="127.htm#fig513b">Figure
  5-13b</a>). However, the time when maximum emissions are attained varies quite
  widely across the scenarios. Emissions peak in the A2-ASF marker scenario in
  2030, in A2- MESSAGE in 2040, in A2G-IMAGE in 2050, in A2- MiniCAM in 2060,
  and in A2-AIM not until 2070. These differences are explained primarily by different
  assumptions about the mechanisms of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction adopted in different models.
  For example, the SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction in A2-MESSAGE is explained by fundamental structural
  changes in the electricity generation technologies, while the A2-ASF scenario
  assumes a rapid introduction of inexpensive end-of-the-pipe sulfur scrubbers
  and shifts to low-sulfur fuel qualities.</p>
<p>The A2-A1-MiniCAM scenario yields a nearly flat sulfur emission profile, explained
  by a relatively slow growth in population and GDP in the first half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (compared to other scenarios of the A2 family) and by expedited technological
  progress in the second half.</p>
<p>Numeric estimates of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions developed by different models vary substantially,
  especially in the middle of the modeling period (<a href="127.htm#fig513b">Figure
  5-13b</a>). Emissions are largest in the A2-AIM scenario, exceeding 160 MtS
  in 2070. From 2020 to 2060 the lowest emissions are produced by the A2-A1- MiniCAM
  scenario, while after 2070 the lowest emissions are achieved in the A2-ASF scenario.</p>
<h4>5.5.2.3. B1 Scenario Family<a name="5523"></a></h4>
<p>Sulfur emissions in the B1 family scenarios fall within the lower third of
  the full range of emissions from the SRES scenarios (<a href="126.htm#fig512">Figure
  5-12</a>). The B1-IMAGE trajectory is generally positioned in the middle of
  the B1 family range in the first decades of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, which corresponds
  to a 75% reduction of emissions in industrialized countries between 2000 and
  2050. The near-term increase in emissions in B1- IMAGE occurs predominantly
  in developing countries and is associated with increases in fossil fuel use
  in those regions, combined with relatively low levels of emission controls.
  After 2040, increased emission controls and declines in fossil fuel use result
  in decreasing SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions.</p>
<p>Emissions in other B1 family scenarios decline even faster than in B1-IMAGE.
  In B1-AIM, a decline in emissions is directly related to per capita incomes.
  As developing countries reach levels of US$3500 per capita in 1990 dollars,
  they start to apply more stringent SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> controls that lead to quickly dropping
  emission levels (<a href="127.htm#fig513c">Figure 5-13c</a>).</p>
<h4>5.5.2.4. B2 Scenario Family<a name="5524"></a></h4>
<p>Emissions in the B2 family scenarios cover close to the full range of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions
  (<a href="126.htm#fig512">Figure 5-12</a>). The B2-MESSAGE scenario yields steadily
  declining global emissions from 1990. This overall trajectory includes a tripling
  of emissions from non-energy sources by 2050, with subsequent stabilization
  and eventual decline after that (<a href="127.htm#fig513d">Figure 5-13d</a>).
  The increase in emissions from non-energy sources is more than offset by very
  rapid reductions in emissions from energy sources between 2015 and 2050. Developing
  countries have rising emissions through to 2025, which stabilize by 2050, and
  decline thereafter. This increase in emissions in developing countries is offset
  by reductions in developed countries. These results are explained largely by
  regional measures and technological changes to minimize critical loads of acidic
  deposition (see <a href="127.htm#box54">Box 5-4</a>). The B2-ASF scenario projects very rapid growth in
  emissions from energy use through 2025, primarily from increases in fossil fuel
  use in developing countries. After 2025, the growth in fossil fuel declines
  and developing countries become wealthier and are more aggressive on SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emission
  controls, which in the ASF model are directly linked to GDP/capita levels. Emissions
  from other industrial sources increase steadily throughout the period as economic
  activity increases.</p>
<h4>5.5.2.5. Inter-Family Comparison<a name="5525"></a></h4>
<p>The relatively rapid desulfurization in the A1B-AIM marker compared to the
  other SRES markers mainly results from high capital turnover rates and, therefore,
  rapid diffusion of new and clean technologies combined with high income levels
  in the developing world by the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (<a href="126.htm#fig512">Figure
  5-12</a>). The structure and patterns of sulfur emissions for the two illustrative
  scenarios in the two scenario groups A1FI and A1T are similar to those of the
  A1B and B1 marker scenarios, respectively, and are therefore not discussed separately
  here.</p>
<p>As technological progress and income growth are the slowest in A2 among all
  the SRES scenario families, the primary energy mix in the A2-ASF marker by 2100
  is still dominated by fossil fuels, with about 50% of the primary energy supplied
  by coal. Although measures are adopted to limit local and regional environmental
  damages, sulfur-mitigation measures in the A2 world are less pronounced than
  in the other SRES scenarios. Therefore, global sulfur emissions in the A2 marker
  are highest as compared to the other markers (<a href="126.htm#fig512">Figure
  5-12</a>).</p>
<p>Following the B1 storyline, in the B1-IMAGE marker the emphasis is on global
  solutions to environmental sustainability and improved welfare and development
  equity. High technological development rates in the renewable energy sector
  result in a continued structural shift away from fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Combined with dematerialization of the economy and with the most pronounced
  sulfur mitigation measures assumed among the SRES scenarios, this results in
  emissions that peak around 2020 and subsequently decline continuously to 2100
  (<a href="126.htm#fig512">Figure 5-12</a>).</p>

      <p><b>Box 5-4: Future Sulfur Dioxide Emissions in the B2 Marker Scenario</b></p>
      <p> Future global emissions of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> are generally lower across the SRES emissions
	scenarios compared to most earlier projections, because of three factors:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Switch to cleaner fuels, such as natural gas and renewable sources.
	</li>
	<li>Transition to cleaner, more efficient coal technologies, such as IGCC
	  generation and pressurized FBC. </li>
	<li>Utilization of direct emissions-reduction technologies, such as FGD.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The scope of reductions from fuel switching is illustrated by the following.
	At present, 60% of anthropogenic SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in developing regions are
	from the direct use of fossil fuels in buildings and industry (Smith et
	al., 2000). Reductions in these emissions will be realized by shifting
	from an energy structure that relies on the direct use of solid fuels
	to one that increasingly relies on distributed energy grids (electricity,
	natural gas, etc.). This shift, and a resultant decrease in SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions,
	has already occurred in Europe and North America. Further reductions are
	expected in the future as more efficient, and inherently low emission,
	fossil fuel technologies (such as IGCC) become commercialized. Explicit
	policies for sulfur emissions reductions, such as the use of FGD devices,
	will be needed to meet emissions targets in the near term, but are likely
	to be less necessary in the longer term. </p>
      <p>To illustrate these trends and the resultant decrease in SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions
	over the 21<sup>st</sup> century, emissions in the B2-MESSAGE scenario (Riahi and
	Roehrl, 2000) are analyzed. Global energy-related SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in this
	B2 scenario decline from 59 MtS in 1990 to about 12 MtS in 2100. The primary
	causes for this reduction are the transition to more advanced coal technologies
	and desulfurization. Consistent with the characteristics of gradual change
	in the B2 storyline, the aggregated emissions coefficient<a href="fn6.htm#11" onClick="showFootnote(6,11); return false;"><sup>11</sup></a> for power
	production from coal declines from about 5.3 kgS/MWh in 1990 to 0.04 kgS/MWh
	in the year 2100. The latter emissions intensity is similar to that of
	the most advanced current technologies, for example, the Siemens IGCC98
	power plant featuring 0.032 kgS/MWh (Baumann et al., 1998). In the second
	half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, desulfurization of the energy system also takes
	place because of the production of methanol from coal. Sulfur removal
	is a process-inherent feature. Methanol is mainly used in the transport
	sector as a substitute for oil products that become scarce after 2050.
      </p>
      <p>The percentage reductions in energy-related SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in the B2 scenario
	are shown in <a href="127.htm#tbl512">Table 5-12</a> as a function of time for five technologies. These
	percentages were obtained by re-calculating the B2-MESSAGE emissions scenario
	with the energy structure and emissions coefficients held constant in
	time at those of 1990. In this hypothetical case, SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in 2100
	would be 227 MtS. Accordingly, energy-related SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions in 2100 are
	reduced by about 215 MtS in the B2 scenario, 68% of which results from
	technological change and 32% from fuel switching. By the year 2100 the
	contribution to these emissions reductions by flue-gas scrubbing (FGD)
	is negligible by the year 2100, because more-advanced coal technologies
	eliminate any need for it. Furthermore, a shift in refining technology
	to lighter oil products, currently underway worldwide, contributes to
	a reduction in SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions, particularly in the early part of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.<br>

<p>In the B2 scenario family, and thus in the B2-MESSAGE marker, strong emphasis
  is placed on regional environmental protection. Dynamics of technological change
  continue along historical trends ("dynamics as usual"), which are slower than
  in the A1 or B1 families, but faster than in the A2 family. Sulfur emission
  projections for the B2 marker scenario were generated on the basis of minimization
  of critical loads of acidic deposition using the methodology described in Amann
  et al. (1996). No explicit link between income levels and sulfur control regime
  was made in this scenario. The resultant sulfur emissions are 61 MtS in 2020,
  56 MtS in 2050, and 48 MtS in 2100 (see <a href="126.htm#fig512">Figure 5-12</a>).</p>
<p>All the SRES marker scenarios anticipate increasing levels of sulfur control,
  with rates and timing ranging from rapid introduction of stringent controls
  in B1-IMAGE to more gradual, later, and less stringent controls in A2-ASF. To
  illustrate the impacts of sulfur controls in the scenarios, an "uncontrolled
  sulfur" variant of the B2 marker scenario was calculated at the International
  Association for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA; for details see <a href="127.htm#box54">Box 5-4</a>). In
  this hypothetical scenario, sulfur emissions amount to 182 MtS in 2050 and 227
  MtS in 2100 (compared to 57 and 47 MtS, respectively, in the B2 marker scenario).
  These emission levels are much higher even than those in the A2 marker scenario
  (105 MtS in 2050 and 60 MtS in 2100).</p>
