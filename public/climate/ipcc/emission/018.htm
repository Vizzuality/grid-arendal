<h3><a name="anc1"></a>9.2.1. Methane Emissions</h3>
<p>Anthropogenic CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions arise from a variety of activities, dominated by
  biologic processes, each associated with considerable uncertainty. The future
  CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions in the scenarios depend in part on the consumption of fossil fuels,
  adjusted for assumed changes in technology and operational practices, but more
  strongly on scenario-specific, regional demographic and affluence developments,
  together with assumptions on preferred diets and agricultural practices. The
  writing team recommends further research into the sources and modeling approaches
  to capture large uncertainties surrounding future CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions.</p>
<p>The resultant CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emission trajectories for the four SRES scenario families
  portray complex patterns (as displayed in <a href="120.htm#fig55">Figure 5-5</a>
  in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a>). For example, the emissions in A2 and B2
  marker scenarios increase throughout the whole time horizon to the year 2100.
  Increases are most pronounced in the high population A2 scenarios where emissions
  rise to between 549 and 1069 (A2 marker: 900) MtCH<small><sub>4</sub></small> by 2100, compared to 310
  MtCH<sub><small>4</small></sub> in 1990. The emissions range by 2100 in the B2 scenarios is between 465
  and 613 (B2 marker: 600) MtCH<small><sub>4</sub></small> . In the A1B and B1 marker scenarios, the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>
  emissions level off and subsequently decline sooner or later in the 21 st century.
  This phenomenon is most pronounced in the A1B marker, in which the fastest growth
  in the first few decades is followed by the steepest decline; the 2100 level
  ends up slightly below the current emission of 310 MtCH<small><sub>4</sub></small> . The range of emissions
  in <a href="021.htm#tblts4a">Table TS-4</a> indicates that alternative developments
  in energy technologies and resources could yield a higher range in CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions
  compared to the "balanced" technology A1B scenario group that includes the A1B
  marker scenario discussed above. In the fossil-intensive A1FI group (combined
  from A1C and A1G groups, as in the SPM), CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions could reach some 735
  MtCH<small><sub>4</sub></small> by 2100, whereas in the post-fossil A1T scenario group emissions are correspondingly
  lower (some 300 MtCH<small><sub>4</sub></small> by 2100). Interestingly, the A1 scenarios generally have
  comparatively low CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> emissions from non-energy sources because of a combination
  of low population growth and rapid advances in agricultural productivity. Hence
  the SRES scenarios extend the uncertainty range of the IS92 scenario series
  somewhat toward lower emissions. However, both scenario sets indicate an upper
  bound of emissions of some 1000 MtCH<small><sub>4</sub></small> by 2100.</p>
<h3> <a name="anc2"></a>9.2.2. Nitrous Oxide Emissions</h3>
<p>Even more than for CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> , the assumed future food supply will be a key determinant
  of future N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions. <i>Size</i>, age structure, and regional spread of
  the global population will be reflected in the emission trajectories, together
  with assumptions on diets and improvements in agricultural practices. Other
  things being equal, N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions are generally highest in the high population
  scenario family A2. Importantly, as the largest anthropogenic source of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O
  (cultivated soils) is already very uncertain in the base year, all future emission
  trajectories are affected by large uncertainties, especially if calculated with
  different models as is the case in this SRES report. Therefore, the writing
  team recommends further research into the sources and modeling of long-term
  N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions. Uncertainty ranges are correspondingly large, and are sometimes
  asymmetric. For example, while the range in 2100 reported in all A1 scenarios
  is between 5 and 10 MtN (7 MtN in the A1B marker), the A2 marker reports 17
  MtN in 2100. Other A2 scenarios report emissions that fall within the range
  reported for A1 (from 8 to 19 MtN in 2100). Thus, different model representations
  of processes that lead to N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O emissions and uncertainties in source strength
  can outweigh easily any underlying differences between individual scenarios
  in terms of population growth, economic development, etc. Different assumptions
  with respect to future crop productivity, agricultural practices, and associated
  emission factors, especially in the very populous regions of the world, explain
  the very different global emission levels even for otherwise shared main scenario
  drivers. Hence, the SRES scenarios extend the uncertainty range of future emissions
  significantly toward higher emissions (4.8 to 20.2 MtN by 2100 in SRES compared
  to 5.4 to 10.8 MtN in the IS92 scenarios. (Note that natural sources are excluded
  in this comparison.)</p>
<h1><a name="anc3"></a>9.2.3. Halocarbons and Halogenated Compounds</h1>
<p>The emissions of halocarbons (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons
  (HCFCs), halons, methylbromide, and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)) and other halogenated
  compounds (polyfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> )) across the
  SRES scenarios are described in detail on a substance-by-substance basis in
  <a href="114.htm">Chapter 5</a> and Fenhann (2000). However, none of the six
  SRES models has its own projections for emissions of ozone depleting substances
  (ODSs), their detailed driving forces, and their substitutes. Hence, a different
  approach for scenario generation was adopted.</p>
<p>First, for ODSs, an external scenario, the Montreal Protocol scenario (A3,
  maximum allowed production) from WMO/UNEP (1998) is used as direct input to
  SRES. In this scenario corresponding emissions decline to zero by 2100 as a
  result of international environmental agreements, a development not yet anticipated
  in some of the IS92 scenarios (Pepper <i>et al.</i>, 1992). For the other gas
  species, most notably for CFC and HCFC substitutes, a simple methodology of
  developing different emission trajectories consistent with aggregate SRES scenario
  driving force assumptions (population, GDP, etc.) was developed. Scenarios are
  further differentiated as to assumed future technological change and control
  rates for these gases, varied across the scenarios consistently with the interpretation
  of the SRES storylines presented in <a href="114.htm">Chapter 4</a> as well
  as the most recent literature.</p>
<p>Second, different assumptions about CFC applications as well as substitute
  candidates were developed. These were initially based on Kroeze and Reijnders
  (1992) and information given in Midgley and McCulloch (1999), but updated with
  the most recent information from the Joint IPCC/TEAP Expert Meeting on Options
  for the Limitation of Emissions of HFCs and PFCs (WMO/UNEP, 1999). An important
  assumption, on the basis of the latest information from the industry, is that
  relatively few Montreal gases will be replaced fully by HFCs. Current indications
  are that substitution rates of CFCs by HFCs will be less than 50% (McCulloch
  and Midgley, 1998). In Fenhann (2000) a further technological development is
  assumed that would result in about 25% of the CFCs ultimately being substituted
  by HFCs (see <a href="123.htm#tbl59">Table 5-9</a> in <a href="114.htm">Chapter
  5</a>). This low percentage not only reflects the introduction of non-HFC substitutes,
  but also the notion that smaller amounts of halocarbons will be used in many
  applications when changing to HFCs (efficiency gains with technological change).
  A general assumption is that the present trend, not to substitute with high
  GWP substances (including PFCs and SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> ) , will continue. As a result of this
  assumption, the emissions reported here may be underestimates. This substitution
  approach is used in all four scenarios, and the technological options adopted
  are those known at present. Further substitution away from HFCs is assumed to
  require a climate policy and is therefore not considered in SRES scenarios.
  The range of emissions of HFCs in the SRES scenario is initially generally lower
  than in earlier IPCC scenarios because of new insights about the availability
  of alternatives to HFCs as replacements for substances controlled by the Montreal
  Protocol. In two of the four scenarios in the report, HFC emissions increase
  rapidly in the second half of the next century, while in two others the growth
  of emissions is significantly slowed down or reversed in that period.</p>
<p>Aggregating all the different halocarbons (CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs) as well as halogenated
  compounds (PFCs and SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>) into MtC-equivalents (using GWPs from IPCC SAR, notwithstanding
  the caveats given in <a href="fn11.htm#6" onClick="showFootnote(11,6); return false;">footnote
  6</a>) indicates a range between 386 and 1096 MtC-equivalent by 2100 for the
  SRES scenarios. This compares with a range of 746 to 875 MtC-equivalent for
  IS92 (which, however, does not include PFCs and SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>). (The comparable SRES range
  excluding PFCs and SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> is between 299 and 753 MtC-equivalent by 2100.) The
  scenarios presented here indicate a wider range of uncertainty compared to IS92,
  particularly toward lower emissions (because of the technological and substitution
  reasons discussed above).
<p>The effect on climate of each of the substances aggregated to MtC-equivalents
  given in <a href="021.htm#tblts4a">Table TS-4</a> varies greatly, because of
  differences in both atmospheric lifetime and the radiative effect per molecule
  of each gas. The net effect on climate of these substances is best determined
  by a calculation of their radiative forcing - which is the amount by which these
  gases enhance the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. The radiative forcing will
  be addressed in IPCC TAR and is thus not discussed in this report.

<p>Emissions of sulfur portray even more dynamic patterns in time and space than
  the CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions shown in Figures <a href="016.htm#figts7"> TS-7</a> and <a href="017.htm#figts8">TS-8</a>.
  Factors other than climate change (namely regional and local air quality, and
  transformations in the structure of the energy system and end use) intervene
  to limit future emissions. <a href="#figts10">Figure TS-10</a> shows the range
  of global sulfur emissions for all SRES scenarios and the four markers against
  the emissions range of the IS92 scenarios, more than 80 scenarios from the literature,
  and the historical development.</p>
<p>A detailed review of long-term global and regional sulfur emission scenarios
  is given in Grübler (1998) and summarized in <a href="049.htm">Chapter 3</a>.
  The most important new finding from the scenario literature is recognition of
  the significant adverse impacts of sulfur emissions on human health, food production,
  and ecosystems. As a result, scenarios published since 1995 generally assume
  various degrees of sulfur controls to be implemented in the future, and thus
  have projections substantially lower than previous ones, including the IS92
  scenario series. Of these, only the two low-demand scenarios IS92c and IS92d
  fall within the range of more recent long-term sulfur emission scenarios. A
  related reason for lower sulfur emission projections is the recent tightening
  of sulfur-control policies in the OECD countries, such as the Amendments of
  the Clean Air Act in the USA and the implementation of the Second European Sulfur
  Protocol. Such legislative changes were not reflected in previous long-term
  emission scenarios, as noted in Alcamo et al. (1995) and Houghton et al. (1995).
  Similar sulfur control initiatives due to local air quality concerns are beginning
  to impact sulfur emissions also in a number of developing countries in Asia
  and Latin America (see IEA, 1999; La Rovere and Americano, 1998; Streets and
  Waldhoff, 2000; for a more detailed discussion see <a href="049.htm">Chapter
  3</a>). As a result, even the highest range of recent sulfur-control scenarios
  is significantly below that of comparable, high-demand IS92 scenarios (IS92a,
  IS92b, IS92e, and IS92f). The scenarios with the lowest ranges project stringent
  sulfur-control levels that lead to a substantial decline in long-term emissions
  and a return to emission levels that prevailed at the beginnings of the 20 th
  century. The SRES scenario set brackets global anthropogenic sulfur emissions
  of between 27 and 169 MtS by 2050 and between 11 and 93 MtS by 2100 (see <a href="021.htm#tblts4a">Table
  TS-4</a>). In contrast, the range of the IS92 scenarios (Pepper <i>et al</i>.,
  1992) is substantially higher starting at 80 MtS and extending all the way to
  200 MtS by 2050 and from 55 to 230 MtS by 2100.</p>
<p>Reflecting recent developments and the literature, it is assumed that sulfur
  emissions in the SRES scenarios will also be controlled increasingly outside
  the OECD. As a result, both long-term trends and regional patterns of sulfur
  emissions evolve differently from carbon emissions in the SRES scenarios. As
  a general pattern, global sulfur emissions do not rise substantially, and eventually
  decline even in absolute terms during the second half of the 21st century, as
  indicated by the median of all scenarios in <a href="#figts10">Figure TS-10</a>
  (see also Chapters <a href="034.htm">2</a> and <a href="049.htm">3</a>). The
  spatial distribution of emissions changes markedly.</p>
<p>Emissions in the OECD countries continue their recent declining trend (reflecting
  the tightening of control measures). Emissions outside the OECD rise initially,
  most notably in Asia, which compensates for the declining OECD emissions. Over
  the long term, however, sulfur emissions decline throughout the world, but the
  timing and magnitude vary across the scenarios. It should be noted that SRES
  scenarios assume sulfur controls only and do not assume any additional climate
  policy measures. Nevertheless, one important implication of this varying pattern
  of sulfur emissions is that the historically important, but uncertain, negative
  radiative forcing of sulfate aerosols may decline in the very long run. This
  view is also confirmed by the model calculations reported in Subak et al. (1997)
  and Nakicenovic et al. (1998) based on recent long-term GHG and sulfur emission
  scenarios.</p>
