Notes: n/a = no number is provided because the area of regeneration after harvest in the tropical region and part of the temperate region was not available. In addition, regeneration after selective cutting, as it is often
used in the tropics, is difficult to capture with the FAO Definitional Scenario. It is assumed that recent area conversion rates ["recent" = for Annex I Parties AR late 1980s/early 1990s and for D 1980s (except for Canada
and Russian Federation early 1990s); ARD in other regions 1980s] have applied since 1990, and will continue to do so until 2012. The IPCC Definitional Scenario includes transitions between forest and non-forest land
uses under Article 3.3. For the purposes of this table, it is assumed that not only planting, but also other forms of stand establishment such as natural establishment, are considered AR activities. The FAO Definitional
Scenario includes the harvest/regeneration cycle, because regeneration is defined as reforestation. Within the FAO Definitional Scenario, three accounting approaches are distinguished (see paragraph 25 and Section
3.3.2). Uptake rates are intended to span the range within which the average value for each region is expected to be. The lower bound of the estimated average annual stock change corresponds to the lower uptake rate in
AR and the higher bound to the higher uptake rate. Trees have been assumed to grow according to a sigmoidal growth curve. Estimated area for conversion between non-forest and forest should be regarded as an upper
limit for the temperate region total and the tropical region, because some countries may have reported plantations for 1990 but not for 1980, and because some of the plantations may not qualify as resulting from AR
activities under the IPCC Definitional Scenario. Also, for tropical countries, the deforestation estimates are very uncertain and could be in error by as much as ±50%.                                                                                                                            7

 a Projects included are those for which we have sufficient data. Soil carbon management, bioenergy, and other projects are not included for this reason.
 b "Some level of implementation" - Included projects have been partially funded and have begun activities on the ground that will generate increases in car-
   bon stocks and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
 c "Other LULUCF projects" - Refers to selected non-AIJ projects and projects within Annex I countries.
 d Estimated changes in carbon stocks generally have been reported by project developers, do not use standardized methods, and may not be comparable; only
   some have been independently reviewed.
 e Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions have not been reported.
 f Protecting an existing forest does not necessarily ensure a long-term contribution to the mitigation of the greenhouse effect because of the potential for leak-
   age and reversibility through human activities, disturbances, or environmental change. Table 5 does not provide an assessment in relation to these issues.
   Sound project design and management, accounting, and monitoring would be required to address these issues.
