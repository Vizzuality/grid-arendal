<h4>11.3.4.1.3. Climate change and crop yields </h4>
<p>The main climate variables that are important for crops, as for other plants,
  are air temperature and humidity, cloudiness, solar radiation, water, and atmospheric
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration; the first and last of these figure explicitly in climate
  change projections. </p>
<p>Selected crop studies for south and southeast Asia are summarized in Section
  13.6.2 of the Working Group II contribution to the SAR (IPCC, 1996). Yield impacts

  Estimated impacts of climate change on rice yields, as indicated in <a href="#table11-8">Table
  11-8</a>, are highly variable and depend on the rice/yield model, the choice
  of scenario, the region, the growing season, and other factors. Rice models,
  for instance, assume a constraint-free environment for water, fertilizers, pests,
  and other factors. Although there is an acknowledged need for further improvement
  in such models, these estimates clearly demonstrate that a single estimate of
  change in rice yield for the whole region would mean very little. Several local
  studies illustrate the fact that intraregional variability will be important
  in the future, as it is now. </p>
<p>In Bangladesh, the impact of climate change on high-yield rice varieties was
  studied by Karim et al. (1996), using the CERES-Rice model and several scenarios
  and sensitivity analyses. They found that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels increased rice yields.</li>
  <li>Considerable spatial and temporal variations occurred.</li>
  <li>High temperatures reduced rice yields in all seasons and in most locations.</li>
  <li>The detrimental effect of temperature rise more than offset the positive
    effect of increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, experiments in India reported by Sinha (1994) found that higher
  temperatures and reduced radiation associated with increased cloudiness caused
  spikelet sterility and reduced yields to such an extent that any increase in
  dry-matter production as a result of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization proved to be no advantage
  in grain productivity. Similar studies conducted recently in Indonesia and the
  Philippines confirmed these results. Amien et al. (1996) found that rice yields
  in east Java could decline by 1% annually as a result of increases in temperature.
  In a study of northWest India, Lal et al. (1996) also found that reductions
  in yield resulting from a rise in surface air temperature offset the effects
  of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels; the projected net effect is a considerable reduction
  in rice yield. </p>
<p>Simulations of the impact of climate change on wheat yields for several locations
  in India using a dynamic crop growth model, WTGROWS, indicated that productivity
  depended on the magnitude of temperature change. In north India, a 1°C rise
  in mean temperature had no significant effect on potential yields, although
  an increase of 2°C reduced potential grain yields in most places (Aggarwal and
  Sinha, 1993). In a subsequent study, Rao and Sinha (1994) used the CERES-Wheat
  simulation model and scenarios from three equilibrium GCMs (GISS, GFDL, and
  UKMO) and the transient GISS model to assess the physiological effects of increased
  CO<sub>2</sub> levels. In all simulations, wheat yields were smaller than those in the
  current climate, even with the beneficial effects of CO<sub>2</sub> on crop yield; yield
  reductions were associated with a shortening of the wheat-growing season resulting
  from projected temperature increases. Karim et al. (1996) also have shown that
  wheat yields are vulnerable to climate change in Bangladesh. Studies of the
  productivity of sorghum showed adverse effects in rain-fed areas of India (Rao
  et al., 1995). Results were similar for corn yields in the Philippines (Buan
  et al., 1996). </p>
<p>The likely impact of climate change on the tea industry of Sri Lanka was studied
  by Wijeratne (1996). He found that tea yield is sensitive to temperature, drought,
  and heavy rainfall. An increase in the frequency of droughts and extreme rainfall
  events could result in a decline in tea yield, which would be greatest in the
  low-country regions (<600 m). Other important crops of the region include rubber,
  oil palm, coconut, sugarcane, coffee, and spices, but almost no information
  is available on the impact of climate change on these crops. </p>
