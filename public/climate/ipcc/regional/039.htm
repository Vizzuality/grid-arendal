<h4>2.3.7.1. Vulnerability and Adaptation </h4>
<p>It is projected that climate-related mortality will increase in the large cities
  of north Africa (IPCC, 1996), from direct effects as well as from indirect impacts
  of climate change. These impacts will include potential increases in the incidence
  of VBDs such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, onchocerciasis, and trypanosomiasis
  arising from elevated temperatures and altered rainfall. High-elevation locations
  such as Nairobi or Harare may become vulnerable to malaria epidemics because
  the malaria parasite may be able to survive in the possibly warmer conditions
  (IPCC, 1996) at higher elevations than the current limits. </p>
<p>Minimum temperatures (T<span class="subscript">min</span> or nighttime and
  winter temperatures) are crucial parameters for vector survival and affect the
  latitude and elevation of distribution, as well as the length of season permissive
  to transmission. T<span class="subscript">min</span> is known to play an important
  role in limiting the distribution of malaria vector populations at a given locality
  where summer conditions are suitable for transmission (Craig and le Sueur, in
  preparation; Leeson, 1931). Thus, meteorological variables can create conditions
  conducive to disease spread or even to clusters of outbreaks (in the case of
  flooding or drought) (Epstein et al., 1993). A drop in water level in dams and
  rivers also would affect the quality of household and industrial fresh water
  because reduced water volume would increase the concentration of sewage and
  other effluent in rivers-resulting in outbreaks of diseases such as diarrhea,
  dysentery, and cholera. During 1992 and 1993, cholera affected almost every
  country in the SADC region, claiming hundreds of lives. In many drought-affected
  areas in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and South Africa, streams and rivers dried
  up. Villagers (mainly women) had to walk long distances-only to collect polluted
  water, which they shared with wild animals and livestock. SARDC (1994) notes
  that when a major cholera outbreak occurred in several countries in southern
  Africa in the mid-1980s, the region had just come out of another drought. Reduced
  water flow during these droughts reduced the capacity of rivers, streams, and
  swamps to dilute agrochemicals and process fertilizers in fields, adversely
  affecting soil ecosystems. These drought-related problems are likely to increase
  under projected climate change. Vulnerabilities and control measures will affect
  the impact, however. </p>
<p>The growing resistance of insects to insecticides and of microorganisms to
  antimicrobials, as well as the toxicity of pesticides to helpful (predator)
  insects and larger animals (including humans), will limit the effectiveness
  of these control measures. Thus, nurturing environmental conditions that reduce
  vulnerability to VBD spread (e.g., extensive land clearing and monocultures),
  and those that shore up generalized defenses (trees around plots and settlements
  to harbor birds that consume bugs) becomes increasingly important (Epstein,
  1993, 1995). </p>
<p>In west Africa, the population of blackflies-which carry onchocerciases (river
  blindness)-may increase by as much as 25%, according to precipitation projections
  from the GISS GCM. Schistosomiasis and malaria, both of which depend on water
  availability, also are likely to increase as a result of projected expansion
  of irrigation in hot climates. African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness),
  which is carried by the tsetse fly, also could proliferate because higher temperature
  would increase the range of the vector in areas prone to this infection. The
  distribution of tsetse flies may increase in east Africa (Rogers and Packer,
  1993). Other minor health effects could include higher incidences of skin disorders
  or cancers, cataracts and similar forms of eye damage, and suppression of immune
  systems as a consequence of stratospheric ozone depletion-which leads to greater
  ultraviolet radiation (IPCC, 1996). </p>
<p>Nutritional status also is likely to be severely affected by droughts and associated
  crop failures, as in southern Africa during the droughts of the 1980s to early
  1990s. This factor will further reduce the natural persistence of African communities
  and increase exposure to disease. </p>
<p>There is increasing evidence that many emergent and resurgent diseases may
  be related to ecosystem instability (Epstein, 1995). In many cases, this resurgence
  may be related not to climatic change but to other human-induced changes in
  the environment (e.g., lyme disease, dengue, hantavirus) (Levins et al., 1994;
  Wenzel, 1994; Epstein, 1995). Other diseases with clear links to climate and
  climatic change include malaria (Bouma et al., 1994; Loevinsohn, 1994) and cholera
  (Epstein, 1992, 1995; Epstein et al., 1993). Nonclimatic environmental modifications
  often disrupt natural habitats through processes such as deforestation or afforestation,
  resulting in the provision of new habitats for vectors or pathogens. Climatically
  induced change, however, can include short-term impacts as a result of interannual
  variation or long-term change associated with factors such as global warming.
  The effects of such changes are likely to be most noticeable in areas that constitute
  the fringes of distribution of a particular disease. Changes in distribution
  often will cause susceptible populations (those with little or no immunity)
  to be exposed to diseases not previously encountered-and result in severe morbidity
  and mortality. In addition, areas of traditionally low risk may become more
  vulnerable. The implications of such changes, especially in populations that
  lack immunity, have severe consequences (individual, social, and economic) for
  exposed individuals and health authorities. </p>
<p>Rogers (1996) modeled the effect of projected future climate changes on the
  distribution of three important disease vectors-mosquitoes, tsetse flies, and
  ticks-in southern Africa. The human diseases relating to these vectors are malaria
  (mosquitoes) and human African trypanosomiasis (tsetse flies). Climatic change
  may alter not only the physiological constraints placed on the vector but also
  the ability of the parasite to survive within the vector (Molineaux, 1988).
</p>
<p>Within Africa, little evidence exists of causal changes in disease transmission
  and climate. This lack of evidence does not mean that these changes do not exist;
  rather, it may reflect the lack of available epidemiological data as a result
  of poor or absent surveillance and health information systems. Within Africa,
  71.3% of the burden of disease is attributed to infectious diseases; malaria
  is the single greatest contributor (10.8%). All other vector-borne, helminthic,
  and environmentally related diseases that are affected by climate contribute
  about 2% of the total burden of disease. With regard to environmentally related
  diseases in Africa, malaria contributes more than 80% of the cause of lost disability
  adjusted life years (World Bank, 1993; WHO, 1996b). These estimates exclude
  diarrhea but include cholera. </p>
<p>Malaria contributes the highest percentage (>80%) of the climate-related disease
  burden in Africa. The physiological relationships among climate, vectors, and
  pathogens are only partially understood. Malaria provides a good example of
  how potential climate change may affect environmental and vector-borne diseases.
  Surveillance systems and epidemiological data on malaria exist in some of the
  regions most susceptible to climate change, allowing future monitoring to move
  from speculative to causal relationships. </p>
<p>One of the deficient micronutrients in malnourished Africans is iron. Woman
  and children are disproportionately affected by anemia, and pregnant women are
  especially at risk. In addition, one of the major causes of death in acute and
  complicated malaria is anemia. Thus, the potential exists for exacerbated morbidity
  and mortality in regions in which climate change may decrease nutritional status
  and increase malaria transmission. </p>
<p>Climate-related impacts on health status are likely to increase most within
  Africa, largely as a result of the high burden of disease within the continent
  and its vulnerability in terms of mitigation and nutritional status. In contrast
  to other regions of the world, a significant proportion of the burden of disease
  in Africa is related to climatically affected infectious diseases. Typical of
  many of these diseases in Africa is the fact that their severity focuses within
  the tropics, and infection rates approach saturation. Thus, the marginal regions
  of distributions, where severity of transmission is restricted climatologically,
  are most likely to be affected by climatic change. It is important to distinguish
  between restrictions related to rainfall and those related to temperature. In
  cases where rainfall restricts distribution, increases in temperature may result
  in a decrease in disease incidence and distribution. Conversely, in areas where
  low temperature currently limits distribution, increased temperature may increase
  regional severity and cause distributional extension. </p>
