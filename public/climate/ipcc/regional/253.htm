<h4>9.3.6. Coastal Systems </h4>
<h4>9.3.6.1. Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Changes<a name="sea"></a> </h4>
<p>Major coastal impacts will result from accelerated sea-level rise; these effects
  will include coastal erosion, saline intrusion, and sea flooding, among other
  impacts. Impact studies have confirmed that low-lying deltaic and barrier coasts,
  low reef islands, and coral atolls are especially vulnerable to the potential
  impacts of sea-level rise (Maul, 1993). Some small islands could suffer land
  loss and experience increased beach erosion, inundation, and flooding from a
  sea-level rise of between 50 cm and 1 m. Leatherman (1994) suggests that sea-level
  rise could convert many islands in the Maldives to sandbars and significantly
  reduce available dry land on larger, more heavily populated islands. In Majuro
  Atoll (Marshall Islands), computation of land loss from a 1-m rise in sea level,
  based on the Bruun rule, suggests that approximately 60 ha of dry land (8.6%
  of the total land area) would be lost to erosion. It also is estimated that
  more than 115 ha of Majuro Atoll would be inundated if a 1-m sea-level rise
  were superimposed on present-day flooding from wave runup and overtopping (Holthus
  et al., 1992). In the case of Kiribati, Woodroffe and McLean (1992) have suggested
  that 12.5% of the total land area would be vulnerable with a 1-m rise in sea
  level. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding these projections, the response of islands to the impacts of
  climate change will vary within regions and even within countries. Islands are
  not passive systems; they will respond dynamically in variable and complex ways
  to sea-level and climate changes (Aalbersberg and Hay, 1993; McLean and d'Aubert,
  1993; McLean and Woodroffe, 1993). For example, the extent to which relative
  sea-level rise will affect coastal recession rates will depend on many factors,
  including (though not limited to) the rate of sediment supply relative to submergence;
  the width of existing fringing reefs; the rate of reef growth; whether islands
  are anchored to emergent rock platforms; whether islands are composed primarily
  of sand or coral rubble; the presence or absence of natural shore-protection
  structures, such as beachrock or conglomerate outcrops; the presence or absence
  of biotic protection, such as mangroves or other strand vegetation; the health
  of coral reefs; and, especially, the tectonic history of the island. </p>
<h4>9.3.7. Human Settlement<a name="human"></a> </h4>
<h4>9.3.7.1. Infrastructure and Settlement<a name="infra"></a> </h4>
<p>Generally, the largest concentrations of settlements on small islands occur
  no further than 1-2 km from the coast, and sometimes much less. In most of the
  eastern Caribbean states, for instance, more than 50% of the population resides
  within 2 km of the coast; the corresponding figure in Barbados is estimated
  to be in the region of 60% (Nurse, 1992). Similarly, large coastal populations
  are the norm in the Pacific and Indian Ocean islands-especially the atoll states,
  where settlement areas may even be sited on the beach itself or on the sand
  terrace (e.g., Tuvalu, Kiribati, Maldives). Clearly, such settlements are at
  risk from projected sea-level rise-which, in all likelihood, would be accompanied
  by inundation, increased flooding, coastal erosion, and consequently land loss.
</p>
<p>On many small islands, critical infrastructure tends to be located in or near
  coastal areas; this infrastructure will be highly vulnerable to the effects
  of projected sea-level rise, especially during extreme events. Similarly, significant
  infrastructural damage could result from any increase in the frequency or intensity
  of extreme events such as floods, tropical storms, and storm surges (Pernetta,
  1992; Alm et al., 1993). Moreover, because island populations tend to congregate
  in the few urban centers where most of the infrastructure and services are located,
  damage to important infrastructure (e.g., coastal roads, bridges, seawalls)
  would be disruptive to several types of economic, social, and cultural activities.
  In Malta, for example, vital desalinization facilities on the coast would be
  at risk in such circumstances (Sestini, 1992). Social and economic dislocation
  would be especially severe among communities with high population densities-such
  as Eauripik, Federated States of Micronesia (950 persons/km<sup>2</sup>); Majuro, Marshall
  Islands (2,188 persons/km<sup>2</sup>); and Male, Republic of Maldives (5,000 persons/km<sup>2</sup>).
</p>
<p>The costs of protecting the shoreline and other infrastructure will vary, depending
  on the kind of protection needed, the length of area to be protected, design
  specifications to be adopted, and the availability of construction materials.
  There is concern, however, that the overall costs of infrastructure protection
  will be beyond the financial means of many island nations. Vulnerability studies
  conducted for selected small islands suggest that the costs of coastal protection
  ("hard" options) would be a significant proportion of GNP (see IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Table 9-3). In Malta and Cyprus, it is estimated that approximately US$550
  million and US$190 million, respectively, would be needed to provide adequate
  shore protection works against a 20-30 cm rise in relative sea level (Sestini,
  1992). Although these estimated costs might not be excessive in the context
  of large economies, they represent considerable financial resources that these
  small island states would have to reallocate. </p>
<p>The cost of insurance is another important factor that must be taken into consideration
  in any assessment of climate change impacts on infrastructure. Property insurance
  costs are extremely sensitive to the effects of catastrophic events such as
  hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes. High-risk locations therefore could face
  high insurance premiums-and even, in extreme cases, withdrawal of coverage (<a href="#box9-3">Box
  9-3</a>). <br>

      1990s. As a direct result, many insurance and reinsurance companies withdrew
      from the market. Those that remained imposed onerous conditions for coverage-including
      very high deductibles; separate, increased rates for windstorms; and insertion
      of an "average" clause to eliminate the possibility of underinsurance (see
      Murray, 1993; Saunders, 1993).</td>
