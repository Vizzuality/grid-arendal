<p><i>Subregional shifts in economic welfare with climate change will likely arise
  as a consequence of impacts on crops with specific temperature requirements
  for growth. </i></p>
<p>Citrus production, for example, may shift slightly northward as temperatures
  rise in southern states. Yields are predicted to decline in southern Florida
  and Texas as a consequence of higher-than-favorable temperatures during the
  winter (Rosenzweig et al., 1996). Warmer temperatures experienced at slightly
  more northern locations may lessen the chance of freeze damage, but the overall
  risk of early- and late-season frost will remain a major factor in crop loss.
  It is worth noting that as a woody perennial, citrus offers little possibility
  of short-term adaptation to climate change through management because the timing
  of phenological events in citrus is not under the control of the orchard manager.
  Other simulation studies show that corn and soybean yields may decrease across
  much of the U.S. corn belt with a 2°C rise in temperature (Phillips et al.,
  1996) and that potato yields may decrease on average by 22% across sites from
  Maine to Washington as temperatures increase 1.5-5°C (Rosenzweig et al., 1996).
</p>
<p>Experimental results in combination with knowledge of physical and biological
  processes, along with modeling of these basic physiological processes, provide
  information on potential changes in yield, which can in turn provide input to
  an agricultural sector model capable of simulating sector-level impacts of alternative
  climate change scenarios (Adams et al., 1995a,b). </p>
<p>Recent work has extended previous studies regarding the economic effects of
  climate change on agriculture to address some of the limitations in earlier
  studies. This new work (Adams et al., 1995b) looks at U.S. agriculture sector
  impacts by incorporating other crops such as fruits and vegetables into the
  regional crop alternatives for the southeastern region and other southerly locations;
  considering the impacts of farmer adaptations to climate change; allowing for
  crop migration into regions where those crops are not currently being grown;
  incorporating changes in forage production and livestock performance; and assessing
  the potential for technological change, as manifested in present and future
  yields, to offset climate change. </p>
<p>The analyses by Adams et al. (1995b) used estimates from uniform incremental
  climate change scenarios and from two GCM-based analyses to assess a wide range
  of potential temperature and precipitation changes, as well as alternative levels
  for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The scenarios included 16 combinations of
  alternative temperature and precipitation changes (0°C, 1.5°C, 2.5°C, and 5°C
  for temperature and -10%, 0%, +7%, and +15% for precipitation). In addition,
  the analysis considered four alternative levels for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations
  (355, 440, 530, and 600 ppm). This scheme produced a total of 64 incremental
  scenarios, which were evaluated for 1990 and 2060 conditions. These scenarios
  represented the data set for estimation of a climate change response function
  for 1990 and 2060 conditions of technological development and agricultural demand.
  In addition to these uniform scenarios, the two GCM-based analyses used climate
  forecasts from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and the Geophysical
  Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)-R30 GCMs (see <a href="003.htm#table1-2">Table 1-2</a>).
  These analyses provided points of comparison with previous studies, as well
  as tests of the reasonableness of the economic effect response functions developed
  from the 64 uniform scenarios. </p>
<p>Estimation of the economic consequences of these scenarios required predictions
  of the impacts of climate change on yield levels for crops and forage, animal
  grazing requirements and performance, crop migration potentials, technology-based
  changes in yields, and changes in water resource availability. These predicted
  changes were then used in an economic model of U.S. agriculture. The economic
  model provided estimates of changes in social welfare, crop prices and quantities,
  resource use, and other measures of economic performance arising from the climate
  scenarios (Adams et al., 1995b). </p>
<p>Under the majority of the climate change scenarios evaluated in the study,
  net welfare increased; only 34 of the 128 scenarios showed welfare losses. In
  general, increases in precipitation and CO<sub>2</sub> increase welfare. Slight-to-moderate
  increases in temperature also could increase welfare. The response function
  analysis also showed that increases in CO<sub>2</sub> and precipitation could offset the
  potentially negative effects of large temperature increases (Adams et al., 1995b).
</p>
<p><i>The magnitude of welfare changes showed modest gains for an optimistic case
  and modest loss to modest gain from an adverse case for present and future technology
  and economic growth cases, respectively. </i></p>
