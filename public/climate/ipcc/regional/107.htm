<h4>5.3.2.1.2. Perennial crops </h4>
<p>Perennial crops mostly include fruit trees, grapevines, and grasslands. </p>
<p><i>Cycle length</i> </p>
<p>Assuming that climate variability does not increase, higher temperatures in
  late winter and early spring will hasten development stages. Concerning fruit
  trees, no experimental or simulation results are known, but it can be expected
  that budbreak will be promoted, as will later stages. On the other hand, higher
  temperatures could be detrimental to flowering quality for cold-requiring species
  and therefore could reduce fruit production. </p>
<p>With grapevines, simulation studies have shown that fruit biomass would decrease
  consistently in northern Italy under weather conditions foreseen by equilibrium
  climate scenarios (but would increase with some transient scenario outputs),
  even if the fertilizing effect of CO<sub>2</sub> is accounted for. The promoting effect
  of CO<sub>2</sub> has been experimentally demonstrated under current conditions by Bindi
  et al. (1996), who show that berry weight and total acidity increase, whereas
  total sugars decrease. </p>
<p>Higher temperatures probably will be beneficial to grasslands (see, e.g., Tchamitchian,
  1994 for perennial ryegrass), at least early in the season, through increased
  early biomass production (earlier senescence also is expected). Higher temperatures
  during the summer may decrease the growth capabilities of grass. Higher CO<sub>2</sub>
  tends to abate the negative effects of temperature, as demonstrated experimentally
  by Soussana et al. (1994). The interaction between nitrogen level and carbon
  distribution in crops nevertheless is a key factor in forecasting the responses
  of grasses (Casella et al., 1996). Some recent years in Europe have illustrated
  the immediate impact of dry periods on grassland production because of low rooting
  depth, shallow soils, etc., leading to a reduction in yield. Similar events
  may become more common in the future. Through simulation experiments, Rounsevell
  et al. (1996) show that grassland production in England and Wales is resilient
  to small increases in temperature and precipitation-and even stimulated at higher
  elevations. Experiments in northern and western Europe have shown positive responses
  in total biomass production across a range of grass species to increased temperature
  (+3ï¿½C) and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (Jones et al., 1996; Jones et al., 1997).
  The interactive response may be less than additive, however, indicating a decline
  in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> as temperature increases. A significant part of
  the temperature response is manifest through an extended growing period. The
  response of below-ground growth to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> appears to be greater than that
  of above-ground growth, and there are differential responses between species-suggesting
  that sward conditions may change significantly in the future (Jones et al.,
  1996; Jones et al., 1997). </p>
<p>For woody species, the influence of changing climates will really depend primarily
  on how long increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations enhance growth and production (i.e.,
  whether there is any acclimation, whether farmers are capable of adapting their
  strategy to such situations, etc.) and secondarily on the influence of CO<sub>2</sub>,
  temperature, and water shortage on fruit quality-which is the major issue in
  fruit production. No real information is available on irrigation needs for fruit
  trees under changing climate conditions. Although grasslands show very different
  responses according to species, they apparently display no acclimation to increasing
  CO<sub>2</sub>. </p>
<p><i>Weeds, pests, and diseases</i> </p>
<p>Weeds are expected to benefit from higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The expected
  result of the crop-weed competition will depend on their respective reactions
  to climate and atmospheric fertilization. C<sub>3</sub> plant growth probably would be
  proportionally more enhanced than C<sub>4</sub> growth as a result of increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.
  This difference can lead to various consequences during the early crop vegetation
  period (fall or spring), depending on which species is weed and which is crop.
  Chemical control of weeds obviously remains possible, but this approach must
  be considered in the context of increasing incentives for environment-friendly
  agriculture in Europe. </p>
<p>Increasing precipitation and temperature in the northern half of Europe probably
  will be linked to increasing air humidity and possibly leaf wetness duration.
  All factors are favorable to early (fall, spring) disease outbursts for annual
  and perennial crops; the same holds for early pest attacks (Harrington et al.,
  1994). Sophisticated agricultural systems probably can cope with increasing
  weeds, pests, and diseases in a sustainable manner (better-targeted and more
  efficient chemicals, risk forecast models, adapted machinery, etc.). The global
  result will depend on how widespread such agriculture will be in Europe around
  2050. Whether controls will be possible in autumn and spring (i.e., whether
  working days will be available) also is questionable and must be studied in
  more detail. (Some model results are available for Finland.) The risk of crop
  damage from pests and diseases increases in all regions under a warming of climate.
  Northward shifts in the distribution of certain pests could be of similar magnitudes
  and rates as those estimated for cereal crops. Additional generations of multivariate
  species also can be expected. The damage potential of diseases such as potato
  late blight could increase at a similar rate as the potential increase in yields
  of the crop host. This analysis implies an increased requirement for pest and
  disease control, with associated consequences for the environment (Carter et
  al., 1996). </p>
<p>None of the models that have been used to predict future agricultural yields
  have taken into account the possibility of future reductions in productivity
  associated with increased concentrations of ozone. Depending on the supply of
  precursors, ozone concentrations are likely to increase in warmer temperatures.
  For example, Legge et al. (1996) have shown that current yield losses of spring
  wheat in Hessen, Germany, may be as high as 15% in some years. Greater losses
  can be expected in parts of Europe where ozone concentrations are higher. </p>
<p><i>Soil erosion</i> </p>
<p>Increasing precipitation probably will induce greater risks of soil erosion,
  depending on the intensity of rain episodes (such information is not currently
  available from available climate scenarios). This possibility needs to be examined,
  as does the expected evolution of soil organic matter. If soil organic matter
  content decreases with increasing temperature as a result of a higher mineralization
  rate, soils will be more susceptible to slaking; consequently, early development
  of crops will be hampered. Some indication exists that the negative effect of
  temperature will be more or less compensated under European conditions by a
  positive impact of carbon fertilization (Balesdent et al., 1994) and that the
  temperature-dependent mineralization rate is larger for clay and sand soils
  than for loam (Houot et al., 1995). Increased rainfall amounts also could increase
  fertilizer leaching in already wet areas; for example, Peiris et al. (1996)
  have simulated decreasing wheat yields under Scottish conditions that are explained
  by such a lack of fertilizer. Changes in vegetation cover probably will play
  a role as well. </p>
<p>Concerning working days, Rounsevell and Brignall (1994) have suggested that
  opportunities for autumn soil tillage in Great Britain will be improved by global
  warming (as a result of increasing water demand), as long as the future precipitation
  increase is no more than 15%. This analysis must be verified for spring conditions
  and other areas. </p>
