<h4>8.2.2. Climate Trends </h4>
<p>A number of studies have examined long-term (century-scale) records of climate
  variables over the North American region. Most of this work has pertained to
  analyses of near-surface air temperature and precipitation. Gridded analyses
  of annual near-surface North American air temperatures for the period 1901-96
  (see <a href="305.htm#figureA-2">Figure A-2</a> in <a href="305.htm">Annex
  A</a>) show
  trends toward increasing temperatures over most of the continent. Temperature
  increases over land are greatest over an area extending from northWestern Canada,
  across the southern Canada/northern United States region, to southeastern Canada
  and the northeastern United States. These increases range mainly from 1-2�C/100
  years. Decreases in annual temperature on the order of 1�C/100 years are observed
  along the Gulf coast and on the order of 0.5�C/100 years off the northeast coast
  of Canada (Environment Canada, 1995). Sea-surface temperatures appear to have
  warmed off both the west and east coasts of the continent, especially in the
  Gulf of Alaska. </p>
<p>The time series of anomalies in mean annual temperature for the entire North
  American region is depicted in <a href="305.htm#figureA-10">Figure A-10</a> in <a href="305.htm">Annex
  A</a>. The record reveals temperatures increasing through the 1920s and 1930s,
  peaking around 1940, and then gradually decreasing through the early 1970s.
  From this point through the late 1980s, temperatures increased to levels similar
  to the 1940 era; they have remained mainly above normal since, with the exception
  of 1996. The more recent warmth has been accompanied by relatively high amounts
  of precipitation (see below), unlike the dry and warm 1930s. The value of the
  overall linear trend for 1901-96 is 0.57�C/100 years, a trend significant at
  better than the 99% confidence level. </p>
<p>The generally increasing temperatures of recent decades, both around the globe
  and across North America, have been found to result mainly from increases in
  daily minimum temperature (T<span class="subscript">min</span>); increases in
  daily maximum temperature (T<span class="subscript">max</span>) have less influence
  on the observed increase in the daily mean temperature (Karl et al., 1993; Horton,
  1995). This trend has caused the diurnal temperature range (DTR) to decrease
  in many areas. Over North America, Karl et al. (1993) found that T<sub>min</sub> increased
  greatly over the western half of the continent from 1951 to 1990-in many locales
  by as much as 2-3�C/100 years. Increases in T<span class="subscript">max</span>
  were smaller, for the most part, with T<span class="subscript">max</span> actually
  decreasing somewhat in the desert SouthWest. The combined effect of these changes
  resulted in decreases in DTR of 1-3�C/100 years for much of western North America
  over the period 1951-90. [Trends are reported in Karl et al. (1993) as degrees
  per century to allow for direct comparison between regions with slightly different
  periods of record and should not be construed as representing actual trends
  over the past century.] Environment Canada (1995) also found that, over a longer
  period of record (1895-1991), maximum and minimum temperatures for Canada have
  been changing at different rates (<a href="#figure8-4">Figure 8-4</a>), with
  the minimum temperatures rising more than twice as much as maximum temperatures
  for the country as a whole.<br>

<p><br>
  Annual precipitation amounts from 1901 to 1995 over North America as a whole
  show evidence of a gradual increase since the 1920s, reaching their highest
  levels in the past few decades (see <a href="305.htm#figureA-10">Figure A-10</a> in <a href="305.htm">Annex
  A</a>). <a href="305.htm#figureA-1">Figure A-1</a> (<a href="305.htm">Annex
  A</a>) indicates
  that the regions experiencing the largest increases are portions of northWestern
  Canada (>20%), eastern Canada (>20%), and the Gulf coast of the United States
  (10-20%). The increases in eastern Canada shown in <a href="305.htm#figureA-1">Figure
  A-1</a> are corroborated by Groisman and Easterling (1994) and Environment Canada
  (1995). The analysis of U.S. Historical Climatology Network data by Karl et
  al. (1996) for 1900-94 reveals the increases along the U.S. Gulf coast and also
  shows 10-20% increases over the central and northern Plains states, much of
  the Midwest and Northeast, and over the desert SouthWest. Decreases of 10-20%
  are apparent over California and the northern Rocky Mountain states (<a href="#figure8-5">Figure
  8-5</a>). <br>
