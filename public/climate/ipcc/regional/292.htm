<h4>11.3.2.1.2. Freshwater wetlands </h4>
<p>Freshwater wetlands or peatlands are accumulations of decomposed organic matter
  that have an ability to store water, reduce floodwater peaks, and provide water
  during dry periods. More than 10% (43 million ha) of global peatlands are located
  in the humid tropical zone of Asia; by far the largest area of peatlands is
  in Indonesia, especially the Kalimantan region, followed by Malaysia and Papua
  New Guinea (Rieley et al., 1995). Tropical peatlands require high rainfall input
  and are sensitive to drought and changes in land use; impacts on drainage, for
  example, compromise the sustained utilization of the peatland resource. Projected
  increases in evapotranspiration and increased rainfall variability are likely
  to have negative impacts on the viability of peatlands, resulting in dessication
  and shrinkage. </p>
<h4>11.3.2.1.3. Montane ecosystems<a name="montane"></a> </h4>
<p>Changes in high-elevation ecosystems can be expected as a consequence of global
  warming. For instance, the present distribution of species is projected to shift
  to higher elevations, although the rates of vegetation change are expected to
  be slow, and colonization success would be constrained by increased erosion
  and overland flows in the highly dissected and steep terrain of the Greater
  Himalayas. Weedy species with a wide ecological tolerance will have an advantage
  over others. High-elevation tree species-such as Abies, Acer, and Betula-prevail
  in cold climates because of their adaptations to chilling winters. Temperature
  increases would result in competition between such species and new arrivals.
  The sensitivity of plants to climatic factors and, in particular, water stress
  in the summit region of Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo-the highest mountain in southeast
  Asia-recently has been demonstrated (Kitayama, 1996). </p>
<h4>11.3.2.1.4. Crop biodiversity<a name="crop"></a> </h4>
<p>In addition to the biodiversity of the region's natural terrestrial ecosystems,
  Tropical Asia has a unique crop-related biodiversity. In particular, the Indochina-Indonesian
  and Hindustani regions have been identified as centers of diversity of a great
  many crops and other economically important plants that originate in these regions.
  Tropical Asia abounds in diverse cereal, tree, spice, and fruit species, which
  are endowed with unique genetic properties. Thousands of accessions of rice,
  cucurbits, legumes, mangoes, citrus, and other species and varieties have been
  collected and conserved. Maintenance of this diversity to allow further evolution
  to occur in response to climate change may be important for future generations,
  particularly when the effects of increasing human populations also are taken
  into account. Moreover, because of their interdependence and shared evolutionary
  history, the plants, animals, and microbes in the region strongly influence
  each other. For example, a change in insect population and diversity could influence
  the evolution of plant biodiversity, and vice-versa. These subjects-which are
  the basis of ecological sustenance, crop and animal improvement, and ultimately
  economic growth-remain unexplored. </p>
<h4>11.3.2.2. Coastal Ecosystems<a name="coastal"></a> </h4>
<p>The Indo-Pacific borderlands contain the greatest shallow-water and intertidal
  biodiversity on Earth. Coral reefs have the highest biodiversity of any marine
  ecosystem; coral reef macrobiota represent about 4-5% of the described global
  biota. Coral reef diversity and the majority of the region's coral genera are
  centered around the archipelagoes of the Philippines and Indonesia. Similar
  rich concentrations of species in the region occur in mangroves and tropical
  sea grasses (Woodroffe, 1990; Mukai, 1993). </p>
<h4>11.3.2.2.1. Coral reefs<a name="coral"></a> </h4>
<p>The effects of climate change on coral reefs have been reviewed by Wilkinson
  and Buddemeier (1994). Brown et al. (1994) have shown that coral reefs are particularly
  sensitive to prolonged increases in seawater temperature and increased irradiance.
  Oxidation stress during exposure to elevated temperatures also has been shown
  to cause coral bleaching (Lesser, 1997). In Tropical Asia, projected increases
  in surface air temperature could lead to increases in seawater temperature,
  posing a major threat to the health of coral reefs. In Indonesia, where severe
  bleaching took place as a result of seawater warming during an ENSO event in
  1983, coral reefs have failed to show continued recovery beyond the initial
  recovery noted in 1988 (Brown and Suharsono, 1990). </p>
<h4>11.3.2.2.2. Mangroves<a name="man"></a> </h4>
<p>Mangroves constitute a significant part of tropical coastal biodiversity. They
  are found throughout Tropical Asia, where they occupy more than 75,000 km<sup>2</sup>,
  or 40% of the world's total area of mangroves. Indonesia alone, with 42,530
  km<sup>2</sup>, accounts for 23% of the world total; India (with 6,700 km<sup>2</sup>), Malaysia (with
  6,424 km<sup>2</sup>), and Bangladesh (with 5,767 km<sup>2</sup>) each have over 3% of the world total
  (Spalding, 1997). Over the past few decades, mangrove forests in Tropical Asia
  have declined considerably as a consequence of human activities. The Philippines
  and Thailand have experienced reductions of 60% and 55%, respectively, over
  25 years. Between 1980 and 1990, the area of mangroves declined by more than
  37% in Viet Nam and more than 12% in Malaysia. These figures suggest a loss
  of nearly 7,500 km<sup>2</sup> of mangrove forests in these four countries alone-representing
  more than 4% of the current global total. </p>
<p>Mangroves may be affected by climate change-related increases in temperature
  and sea-level rise. Although the temperature effect on growth and species diversity
  is not known, sea-level rise may pose a serious threat to these ecosystems.
  In Bangladesh, for instance, there is a threat to species in the three distinct
  ecological zones that make up the Sundarbans-the largest continuous mangrove
  area in the world. If the saline water front moves further inland, Heritiera
  fomes (the dominant species in the landward freshwater zone) could be threatened.
  Species in the other two ecological zones (Excoecaria agallocha in the moderately
  saltwater zone and Ceriops decandra in the saltwater zone) also could suffer.
  These changes could result in economic impacts: Direct employment supported
  by the Sundarbans is estimated to be in the range of 500,000-600,000 people
  for at least half of the year (ESCAP, 1987), and a large number of these people-who
  are directly employed in the industries that use raw materials from the Sundarbans
  (e.g., woodcutting; collection of thatching materials, honey, beeswax, and shells;
  fishing)-may lose their sources of income. Sea-level rise also may threaten
  a wide range of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and crustaceans living
  in the Sundarbans. A large part of the coastal area that now is protected by
  the Sunderbans will be vulnerable to cyclonic storms and surges. In Thailand,
  the potential impact of sea-level rise on the mangrove community is a serious
  issue (Aksorakaoe and Paphavasit, 1993). </p>
