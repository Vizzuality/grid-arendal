<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Ramsden and Fleming (1995) suggest that Arctic sea ice would be little altered
  under doubled CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. More recent analyses by Gordon and O'Farrell (1997),
  who use a dynamic ice procedure within a transient-coupled-atmosphere-ocean
  model, predict a 60% loss in summer sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere by the
  time CO<sub>2</sub> has doubled. In their model, ice loss appeared earlier and proceeded
  more rapidly than it did in the Southern Hemisphere. </p>
<p>Although current polar models are subject to considerable uncertainty, they
  are the best available tools to explore possible future scenarios. A regional
  study of the Canadian sector of the Beaufort Sea proposed an increase from 60
  days to 150 days in the open-water (ice-free) season (McGillivray et al., 1993).
  There could also be reduced ice thickness. The maximum extent of open water
  in summer could increase from the current 150-200 km to 500-800 km offshore.
  At the same time, if longer fetches are available, wave heights would increase
  (e.g., the proportion of waves in excess of 6 m would rise from 16% to 39%)
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.5.4). This increased open-water exposure of the
  ice-rich coastlines would most certainly result in increased erosion. </p>
<p>Using empirical ice growth-melt models, Wadhams (1990) predicts that in the
  NorthWest Passage and Northern Sea Route, a century of warming would lead to
  a decline in winter fast-ice thickness from 1.8-2.5 m at present to 1.4-1.8
  m and an increase in the ice-free season of 41-100 days. Other researchers,
  using another mix of models, find these ice-free day estimates a little high
  (Flato and Brown, 1996). This effect will be of great importance for the extension
  of the navigation season in the Russian Northern Sea Route and the NorthWest
  Passage. </p>
<p>Predicting the future character of moving pack ice is a difficult problem because
  dynamics (ocean and wind currents), rather than thermodynamics (radiation and
  heat components), determine its average thickness. Wind stress acting on the
  ice surface causes the ice cover to open up to form leads (ice-free areas).
  Later, under convergent stress, refrozen leads and thinner ice elements are
  crushed to form pressure ridges. Exchanges of heat, salt, and momentum are all
  different from those that would occur in fast-ice cover. The area-averaged growth
  rate of ice is dominated (especially in autumn and early winter, when much lead
  and ridge creation take place) by the small fraction of the sea surface occupied
  by ice less than 1 m thick (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.4.5). </p>
<p>In the coastal zones of the Arctic Ocean-such as off the Canadian Arctic Archipelago,
  where there is net convergence of currents-the mean ice thickness is very high
  (7 m or more) because of ridging. Here the mean thickness is determined by mechanical
  factors, largely the strength of the ice, and may not be as sensitive to global
  warming as in other regions (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.4.5). </p>
<p>Feedback mechanisms in the Arctic often are strong and complex, and not all
  have been fully identified or quantified. Most are positive in nature. For example,
  as biomes migrate northward, taller plants will tend to lower albedo, especially
  where they protrude through the snow. This will lead to a further enhancement
  of warming. Similarly, decreases in the extent of snow and ice cover will lower
  albedo and act to warm the water and land. Increased precipitation, expected
  with many warming scenarios, could provide a possible negative feedback as some
  will contribute to increased snow thickness. As Arctic warming increases the
  open-water area, precipitation may further increase and cause thicker snow cover,
  including on sea ice. The growth rate of land-fast ice could be expected to
  decrease, as has been directly observed (Brown and Coté, 1992). However, if
  snow thickness is increased to the point where not all of it is melted in summer,
  more protection may be conferred on the ice surface-which could lead to an increase,
  rather than a decrease, in equilibrium ice thickness (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
  7.4.5). This scenario also would increase the stability of the upper mixed layer
  of the ocean, leading to more sea ice production. </p>
