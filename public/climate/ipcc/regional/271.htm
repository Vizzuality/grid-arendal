<h4>10.2.2. Hydrology and Water Resources </h4>
<h4>10.2.2.1. Hydrological Systems<a name="hydro"></a> </h4>
<p>Global warming affects stream hydrology in many ways. In mid- and high-latitude
  regions-where warmer temperatures and a shift toward more rainfall and less
  snowfall in winter are projected-the seasonality of discharge regimes of snowmelt
  streams would shift toward higher winter flows and lower spring and summer flows.
  In semi-arid regions, streams and rivers may experience large increases in hydrological
  variability, with more frequent and larger floods with high sediment loads and
  longer droughts. In humid regions, streams and rivers are likely to experience
  reductions in total rainfall and/or increases in evapotranspiration that produce
  longer, more severe droughts during the warm season (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections
  10.3.5, 10.3.7, and 10.4.2). </p>
<p>In mountain regions, glaciers will provide extra runoff as the ice disappears.
  In general, the extra runoff would persist for a few decades; in areas with
  very large glaciers, it may last for a century or more. By 2050, the volume
  of runoff from glaciers in central Asia is projected to increase threefold.
  Tentative estimates have been made for central Asia based on mass balances from
  a small number of Tien Shan glaciers for the period 1959-1992. Extrapolation
  to the whole area of central Asia suggests that its glacier mass may have decreased
  by 804 km<sup>3</sup> over that time, representing a 15% increase in glacial runoff. Eventually,
  however, glacial runoff will taper off or even cease. Projected glacier runoff
  in 2100 is about 68 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, compared with the present value of 98 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 7.4.2). </p>
<p>Widespread loss of permafrost over extensive continental and mountain areas
  would trigger erosion or subsidence of ice-rich landscapes and change hydrological
  processes. Revegetation of terrain following deglaciation is slow in high-mountain
  areas. This lag leaves morainic deposits unprotected against erosion for extended
  periods (decades to centuries), which can result in increased sediment loads
  in alpine rivers and accelerated sedimentation in lakes and artificial reservoirs
  at high altitudes. On slopes steeper than about 25-30 degrees, stability problems
  such as debris flows will develop in freshly exposed or thawing nonconsolidated
  sediments (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.4.3 and Box 7-2). </p>
<h4>10.2.2.2. Water Supply<a name="water"></a> </h4>
<p>Overall, most 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium scenario simulations show a decrease in water
  supplies throughout Temperate Asia, except in a few river basins. Warmer winters
  may affect water balances because water demands are higher in spring and summer.
  Glacial melt may lead to nonsustainable supplies of surface water (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Chapter 14). </p>
<p>To balance water supply with water demand, more efficient water management
  is likely to be the approach taken by Japan. In other parts of Temperate Asia,
  water resource development will remain important. There, the central adaptation
  issue is how climate change might affect the design of new water resource infrastructure.
</p>
<p>Because many river basins are international, climate change would exacerbate
  current international conflicts over water use and potentially cause new conflicts
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 14.2.3). Clearly, multiple-stress impact studies
  on water resources in international river basins are needed. </p>
<h4>10.2.2.3. Water Resources in China<a name="res"></a></h4>
<p><a href="#table10-5">Table 10-5</a> shows the impacts of climate change on
  the annual runoff of seven river basins in China, located in different climate
  zones from south to north. For all four GCMs, projected changes in runoff are
  the result mainly of changes in precipitation in spring, summer, and autumn
  because of the strong influence of the monsoon climate (Liu, 1997). <br>

  The model results from the four GCMs suggest that the most sensitive and vulnerable
  areas to climate change would be in the northern part of China: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Within climatic regions, runoff is likely to be more sensitive to climate
    change in the plains than in mountain areas.</li>
  <li>In the Huaihe River basin and the area to its north, reduced runoff would
    occur mainly in the spring, summer, and autumn (most significantly in the
    summer as a result of high temperatures and less rainfall), which may unfavorably
    affect reservoir storage.</li>
  <li>For the Songhuajiang River, Liaohe River, Haihe River, upper reach of the
    Yellow River, Huaihe River, and Dongjiang River, increases in runoff would
    occur mainly in the spring, summer, and autumn, necessitating greater flood
    control.</li>
  <li>In moderately and extremely dry years, the projected potential water deficiency
    caused by climate change in the Huaihe River basin and the area to its north-although
    less than that caused by population growth and economic development-may seriously
    exacerbate existing water shortages and thus badly affect socioeconomic development
    in these areas.</li>
  <li>Single isolated reservoir systems are less adaptable than integrated multiple
    reservoir systems to reduced water resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adaptation strategies for water-resource management in China could include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strengthening water-resource management infrastructure</li>
  <li>Increasing investment in water-saving technology and enhancing public consciousness
    of water saving</li>
  <li>Strengthening the management of existing water projects</li>
  <li>Strengthening protection of water sources and developing new water sources</li>
  <li>Implementing step-by-step interbasin water-transfer projects</li>
  <li>Promoting water conservation and establishing water statutes</li>
  <li>Formulating contingent response measures for extraordinary conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most critical area of uncertainty is the lack of credible projections of
  the regional climate in Temperate Asia. In particular, the effect of climate
  change on the Asian monsoon or the ENSO phenomenon is unknown. Presently, there
  are two diametrically opposite projections: one showing a strengthening and
  the other a weakening of the Asian monsoon, which would result in completely
  opposite impacts on hydrology and water resources. Other uncertainties are introduced
  in the downscaling of precipitation from the GCM grid scale to the scale of
  hydrological models for river basins, through the stochastic or interpolation
  method. There also is considerable uncertainty in the translation of climate
  change into hydrological effects through hydrological models: The parameters
  in hydrological models, which are calibrated by historical data, are not transferable
  either geographically or in terms of a changing environment. In addition, the
  impact of climate change on evapotranspiration and groundwater-both of which
  are important for long-term projections of water resources-so far cannot be
  estimated appropriately. </p>
<p>Research and monitoring needs include projection of regional climate scenarios
  with high spatial and temporal resolution, improved hydrological models with
  appropriate land surface parameters under nonstationary climatic conditions,
  integrated impact studies that consider different sectors and their responses
  to adaptation strategies, and enhanced hydrological monitoring networks. </p>
