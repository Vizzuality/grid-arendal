<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Results fom a recent study of dengue fever in island states of the South Pacific
  have shown a strong link between the incidence of outbreaks of the disease and
  the ENSO phenomenon (Hales et al., 1996). Although climate models do not, at
  present, give reliable projections of ENSO events with global warming, ENSO
  phenomena are known to be associated with interannual warming and rainfall anomalies
  (Hay et al., 1993a; Salinger et al., 1995; Centella et al., 1996). It therefore
  appears highly probable that changes in ENSO patterns would affect the incidence
  of dengue fever. </p>
<p>An increase in the incidence of waterborne and food-borne infectious diseases,
  particularly in tropical regions, could result from a rise in temperature, microorganism
  proliferation, and a higher incidence of flooding and water shortages. Algal
  blooms-which occur in warm tropical waters and are associated with biotoxin
  contamination of fish and shellfish-also could become more frequent, resulting
  in the proliferation and increased transmission of cholera. Recent research
  has shown a clear relationship between increased incidence of cholera outbreaks
  and sea warming, owing to the ability of zooplankton to function as a reservoir
  for a dormant state of the pathogen (Colwell, 1996). In general, biotoxins such
  as ciguatera are known to be temperature sensitive; therefore, they could become
  more abundant with ocean warming, resulting in a higher incidence of seafood
  contamination and biotoxin poisoning. Microbiological contamination already
  is a problem in the coastal areas of many small islands, where sewage and solid-waste
  disposal systems currently are inadequate. These combined circumstances would
  place additional stress on already overextended health sectors of most small
  islands and may even threaten the nutritional status of some of these countries.
</p>
<p>Among the strategies that could be adopted to ameliorate some of the negative
  effects of climate change on the health sector are the mounting of an effective
  public education program aimed at improving personal behavior and hygiene; upgrading,
  extension, and maintenance of existing health-care facilities and services;
  implementation and maintenance of appropriate, cost-efficient sewage and solid-waste
  management systems; adoption of appropriate disaster preparedness and management
  plans; and wider application of available protective technologies, such as water
  purification and sewage treatment (McMichael et al., 1996). In addition, Health
  Early Warning Systems (HEWS)-which incorporate seasonal and interannual climate
  forecast information-could be used to detect ecological conditions conducive
  to outbreaks of climate-sensitive diseases such as cholera, malaria, and dengue.
  Lessening the vulnerability of small islands to such health threats through
  these types of improved planning measures and implementation of timely strategies
  would reduce human suffering and economic losses. </p>
