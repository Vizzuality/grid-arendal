<h4>8.3.2.1. Distribution and Sensitivities </h4>
<p>Three broad forest types are recognized in this assessment of North American
  forests: boreal, temperate evergreen, and temperate mixed forests. The boreal
  forest (<a href="315.htm">Annex C</a>, <a href="320.htm#figureC-1">Figure C-1</a>) is
  constrained by cold temperatures to the north that limit tree height and reproduction
  (Lenihan and Neilson, 1993; Starfield and Chapin, 1996). The southern limits
  of the boreal forest generally are defined by their juxtaposition with temperate
  forests or with interior savanna-woodlands and grasslands. Boreal tree species
  generally are not limited from growing further south. Rather, temperate hardwoods
  and conifers are limited by cold temperatures from spreading further north;
  where temperate species can flourish, they outcompete boreal species. Fire and
  herbivore browsing also are important constraints on forest distribution and
  species composition (Bergeron and Dansereau, 1993; Landhauser and Wein, 1993;
  Suffling, 1995; Starfield and Chapin, 1996). Wildfire and insect outbreaks limit
  forest productivity and can produce considerable mortality: Annual tree mortality
  losses from insect outbreaks in Canada are about 1.5 times the losses from wildfire
  and amount to about one-third of the annual harvest volume (Fleming and Volney,
  1995). Annual losses from insects and fire in the United States also are about
  one-third of the annual harvest (Powell et al., 1993). Warming-induced changes
  in the timing of spring frosts may be important in ending or prolonging outbreaks.
  Increased drought stress also may enhance insect outbreaks, and changes in climate
  could extend the ranges of some insects and diseases. </p>
<p>Temperate evergreen forests (<a href="315.htm">Annex C</a>), such as in the
  Pacific NorthWest, tend to occur in areas that are warm enough for photosynthesis
  during the cool parts of the year but often are too cold for deciduous species
  to fix sufficient carbon during the frost-free season (Woodward, 1987). Areas
  with dry summers also tend to favor conifers or hardwoods with water-conserving
  leaves (Waring and Schlesinger, 1985; Neilson, 1995). Summer drought and winter
  chilling for frost hardiness are critical climate factors, rendering these forests
  sensitive to global warming (Franklin et al., 1991). NorthWest conifers are
  long lived and need only successfully reproduce once during their life span
  for population sustainability (Stage and Ferguson, 1982; Parker, 1986; Savage
  et al., 1996). With global warming, however, establishment periods could become
  rare in some areas; after harvest, some forests may not be able to regenerate,
  even if mature trees could still survive the climate. Winter chilling may be
  required for adequate seed set or to confer frost-hardiness in some species
  (Burton and Cumming, 1995); because of the well-recognized spatial variation
  in the genetics of these species, however, such chilling requirements may not
  hold everywhere. Fire suppression in interior pine forests has left them in
  a sensitive condition with respect to drought, fire, and pests (Agee, 1990;
  Sedjo, 1991). Climate change could exacerbate all of these stressors (Williams
  and Liebhold, 1995). For example, increased drought stress could facilitate
  insect outbreaks; drought and infestation could lead to more fuel, increasing
  the risk of catastrophic fire. </p>
<p>Temperate mixed forests (mixed hardwood and conifer) are bound by cold temperatures
  to the north and subtropical dry regions to the south (the Caribbean coast in
  North America) and tend to occur in areas that are wet in both winter and summer.
  Temperate hardwood species also benefit from cold-hardening; with warmer winter
  conditions and less insulating snow cover, they can be sensitive to spring frost
  damage, which can kill roots and further sensitize the species to drought stress
  and widespread mortality (Auclair et al., 1996; Kramer et al., 1996). Southeastern
  U.S. pines within this type are among the most important commercial species
  on the continent. Natural southeastern pine stands historically relied on fire
  to maintain their composition (Komarek, 1974; Sedjo, 1991) but now are largely
  controlled by harvest. Compared to northWestern forests, southeastern conifers
  have a short rotation, which might confer more rapid adaptive capability through
  establishment of new genotypes. </p>
<p>Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> affects the physiology of trees, possibly increasing productivity,
  nitrogen-use efficiency and WUE (reduced transpiration per carbon fixed, conferring
  some drought resistance), and other responses (Bazzaz et al., 1996; IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Section A.2.3). A review of 58 studies indicated an average 32% increase
  in plant dry mass under a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Wullschleger et al.,
  1995). Norby (1996) documented an average 29% increase in annual growth per
  unit leaf area in seven broadleaf tree species under 2xCO<sub>2</sub> scenarios over a
  wide range of conditions. WUE, examined in another review and indexed by reductions
  of leaf conductance to water vapor, increased about 30-40% (Eamus, 1991). If
  such responses were maintained in forests over many decades, they would imply
  a substantial potential for increased storage of atmospheric carbon, as well
  as conferring some increased tolerance to drought. However, some species or
  ecosystems exhibit acclimation to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> by downregulating photosynthesis
  (Bazzaz, 1990; Grulke et al., 1990; Grulke et al., 1993); others do not exhibit
  acclimation (Bazzaz, 1990; Teskey, 1997). Understanding the sources of large
  uncertainties in the linkages between forest physiology and site water balance
  is a research need; no two models simulate these complex processes in the same
  way. </p>
