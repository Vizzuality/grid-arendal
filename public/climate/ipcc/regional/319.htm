<h4>C.6.1. Control Climate </h4>
<p>MAPSS and BIOME3 produce similar vegetation maps under current climate, but
  there are some differences. Some of the discrepancies between MAPSS and BIOME3
  under current climate (<a href="320.htm">Figure C-1</a>) are due to questions
  of classification, especially in the drier types. For example, the Sahel region
  in Africa is labeled as 'shrub-steppe' in the original BIOME3 classification,
  but as various grassland types in MAPSS. The MAPSS grassland types do allow
  some shrubs, but the shrub density is usually reduced by the fire model, which
  assumes that there has been no reduction in fuel due to grazing. Were such land-use
  constraints included, the two models would be in better agreement on the classification.
  This classification difference between the models occurs over many of the drier
  parts of the world. </p>
<p>The models each appear to be better calibrated to their 'home' continents than
  either is to other continents. For example, MAPSS over-estimates the distribution
  of Temperate Evergreen Forests (conifers) in western Europe; while, BIOME3 overestimates
  the distribution of Temperate Mixed Forests (broadleaf) in western North America
  (<a href="318.htm#tableC-1">Table C-1</a>); yet, the two models are generally
  in agreement on the amount and location of temperate forests. </p>
<p>One area of significant departure from observed vegetation is the Pampas of
  southern South America. Both models simulate forests where grasslands are generally
  predominant. Various hypotheses for this discrepancy include unique soils, fire
  disturbance, rainfall seasonality and interannual variability of rainfall (VEMAP
  Members, 1995; Neilson, 1995; Neilson and Marks, 1994) and represent a focus
  for future research. Other local to regional errors in the MAPSS and BIOME3
  classifications will be apparent to the knowledgeable reader. Reasons for these
  errors are many, but include 1) possible errors in the interpolated climate,
  2) grazing, harvest, fire and other disturbances, and 3) missing or weak representation
  of some processes in the models. Globally, both models are reasonably accurate
  and are generally considered to be more accurate under altered climates than
  previous, empirical approaches (VEMAP Members, 1995). Empirical approaches cannot
  simultaneously simulate changes in vegetation distribution and changes in vegetation
  density and hydrology. Nor can they examine the sensitivity of the system to
  altered CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. However, as the focus shifts to ever smaller regions
  or locales, the model uncertainty and the likelihood of error increases. </p>
<h4>C.6.2. Future Vegetation Distribution<a name="c62"></a> </h4>
<p>Both MAPSS and BIOME3 produce large shifts of cold-limited vegetation boundaries
  into higher latitudes and elevations. However, the water-controlled boundaries
  may exhibit any direction of change, depending on the interaction of several
  variables including among others, the relative changes in temperature and precipitation,
  and whether or not the direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> have been incorporated. </p>
<p>The older GCM scenarios tend to be hotter than the newer ones and produce a
  more dramatic change in vegetation distribution. The MAPSS results under GFDL-R30
  serve to illustrate one of the older simulations. MAPSS and BIOME2 (Haxeltine
  et al., 1996) were similar over the U.S. under this scenario (VEMAP Members,
  1995), if both incorporated the direct CO<sub>2</sub> effects. MAPSS was far more xeric
  in response than BIOME2 without the direct CO<sub>2</sub> effects (ibid). </p>
<p>The Tundra decreases by as much as 1/3 to 2/3 of its present size, as does
  the Taiga/Tundra, under all scenarios and with both ecological models (<a href="318.htm#tableC-1">Table
  C-1</a>, Figures <a href="320.htm#figureC-2">C-2</a>, <a href="320.htm#figureC-3">C-3</a>,
  <a href="320.htm#figureC-4">C-4</a> and <a href="320.htm#figureC-5">C-5</a>).
  The boreal forest expands in size under all scenarios ranging from 108% to 133%
  of its present size (MAPSS only). Since BIOME3 includes the Taiga/Tundra, which
  contracts under all warming scenarios (MAPSS simulations), with the Boreal Conifer
  Forest, which expands under all scenarios (MAPSS simulations), the net change
  simulated by BIOME3 usually indicates a loss of Boreal Forest. However, the
  aggregation of the two types in BIOME3 hides the observation that the two vegetation
  types (as defined above) tend to change in opposite sign with respect to area,
  i.e., Taiga/Tundra decreasing, Boreal Conifer increasing. The two models are
  quite consistent in the simulated response of the combined biomes (<a href="318.htm#tableC-1">Table
  C-1</a>). Temperate forests (inclusive of both types) increase in area (107%
  to 158%). Tropical forests could either expand or contract, largely dependent
  on the inclusion of the direct CO<sub>2</sub> effect, but also dependent on the severity
  of the scenario. Savanna/woodlands expand or contract, depending on whether
  or not they are encroached upon by neighboring forests or semi-arid lands, again
  reflecting whether or not direct CO<sub>2</sub> effects are considered and on the scenario.
  BIOME3 shows a competitive displacement of tropical savannas by neighboring
  forests, due to the superior competitive ability in the model of the C<sub>3</sub> trees
  over the C<sub>4</sub> grasses under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. The total area of grasslands and shrublands
  in these simulations remains largely unchanged or expands by as much as 27%,
  depending on the CO<sub>2</sub> effect and the scenario. If the direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> are
  included, arid lands tend to contract in all scenarios, shifting to less arid
  types (<a href="318.htm#tableC-1">Table C-1</a>, Figures <a href="320.htm#figureC-2">C-2</a>,
  <a href="320.htm#figureC-3">C-3</a>, <a href="320.htm#figureC-4">C-4</a> and
  <a href="320.htm#figureC-5">C-5</a>). Without the direct CO<sub>2</sub>, arid lands either
  expand or contract in area, depending on the climate scenario and the ecological
  model. </p>
