<h4>5.3.1.2. Grasslands and Rangelands </h4>
<p>Because of the likely shifts of phytoclimatic boundaries in a warmer world
  (based on GCM estimates for Europe of 3±1.5°C in the next century), there will
  be changes in the distributions of Mediterranean and boreal grassland species.
  Changes in individual species will depend on the nature of the climate change
  in a given area. Because the ranges of many species are determined primarily
  by soil moisture patterns, changes in the absolute amounts of precipitation
  and the seasonal distributions of precipitation will be important in determining
  vegetation responses. Some grassland species also may respond to increasing
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations-with the greatest responses among species characteristic
  of productive, undisturbed habitats and the lowest responses among species adapted
  to high environmental stress or rates of physical disturbance (Hunt et al.,
  1991, 1993). Experiments with alpine grassland species suggest, however, that
  any effects will be apparent only if CO<sub>2</sub> increases are accompanied by climatic
  warming or enhanced nitrogen supply; increases in CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations alone have
  little effect (Schäppi and Körner, 1996). </p>
<p>In Mediterranean countries, displacement of grass and dwarf shrub steppes will
  occur at the expense of existing sclerophyllous shrubland. Extension of shrubland
  as a result of agricultural release is expected-with a parallel rise in wildfire
  episodes, loss of water through enhanced evapotranspiration, and a decrease
  in livestock grazing (with concomitant increases in game and other wildlife).
  Furthermore, shifts in carbon storage from soil to biomass are likely to occur.
</p>
<p>In northern Europe, there is likely to be a reduction in the number and extent
  of mires and tundra and permafrost areas as forests expand into the tundra zone.
  In addition, changes in the concentration of atmospheric gases may alter competitive
  relationships in the plant community. A series of complex responses can be expected
  because of the interaction of different environmental factors. For example,
  an increase in temperature is likely to result in an increase in nutrient availability
  because of the greater mineralization of soil organic matter by soil microorganisms
  (Anderson, 1991; Bonan and Van Cleve, 1992). As with forests, the responses
  will be species-specific (Baxter et al., 1994; Parsons et al., 1994, 1995).
</p>
<h4>5.3.1.3. Noncoastal Wetlands <a name="non"></a></h4>
<p>Most of the major noncoastal wetland areas in Europe are confined to northern
  Scotland, Fennoscandia, and northern Russia (Hartig et al., 1997). A changing
  climate is likely to have a significant impact on peat formation and ecological
  function in such regions. An increase in temperature by 1-2°C accompanied by
  decreases in soil moisture would lead to an estimated 25% reduction in peat
  formation. </p>
<p>Tundra peatlands will be extremely vulnerable because higher temperatures will
  result in thawing of the permafrost layer in areas with discontinuous permafrost,
  as well as an enlargement of the active layer in continuous permafrost. This
  shift will have considerable implications because permafrost is a key factor
  in maintaining high water levels in these systems. Further, it is unlikely that
  new permafrost areas will develop. As a result, hydrology and landscape patterns
  will be affected, leading to lowered water tables in some areas and the overflow
  of flooded thaw lakes in others. Such melting may shift bogs on permafrost back
  to fens, from which they originated after the warm mid-Holocene period (5000-6000
  years BP). </p>
<p>A rapid rate of climatic change-implied by climate model simulations for northern
  latitudes-may cause degradation of the southern boundaries of wetlands and peatlands
  much faster than the northward expansion potential of their northern boundaries.
  Such an imbalance between biomass loss on the one hand and biomass increase
  on the other is likely to have implications for the carbon cycle, whereby the
  wetlands could undergo a reversal from sinks to sources of carbon. There also
  would be consequences for methane fluxes in these regions. A change in the total
  methane flux from northern wetlands can be expected if the areal extent of wetlands
  changes, the duration of the biologically active period is modified, or the
  production or oxidation of methane per unit area changes. Because of uncertainties
  in the changes in water regimes as projected by climate models, however, it
  is difficult to obtain reliable quantitative estimates for shifts in methane
  fluxes to the atmosphere. </p>
<p>Many peatlands may be subject to increasing pressure from afforestation operations
  as a result of changes in land capability classifications (Proe et al., 1996).
  At the same time, degradation of peatlands is likely to increase the conservation
  value of the remaining intact areas, thereby creating the potential for more
  intense land-use conflicts. </p>
<p>Water draining from peatlands also is likely to be sensitive to climatic change,
  particularly in the form of summer droughts. Such droughts could increase autotrophy
  in the streams, leading to increases in the biofilm biomasses present in the
  water. Changes in nutrient content also may occur, with increases in inorganic
  nutrients and decreases in organic nutrients (Freeman et al., 1994). </p>
<p>Studies indicate that wetlands in semi-arid regions of southern Europe can
  be very sensitive to climate warming; such warming has severe effects on their
  hydrological and ecological functions. They also are likely to be adversely
  affected by increased water demands. Biological reserves such as the Cota Donana
  in Spain are likely to come under increasing pressure. </p>
