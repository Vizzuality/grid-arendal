<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>It is difficult to generalize about the sensitivity of wetlands to climate
  change (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 6). It appears, however, that climate change
  will have its greatest effect through alterations in hydrological regimes-in
  terms of the nature and variability of the hydroperiod (the seasonal pattern
  of water level) and the number and severity of extreme events (Gorham, 1991;
  Poiani and Johnson, 1993). However, other variables related to changing climate
  may drive a site-specific response. Such variables include increased temperature
  and altered evapotranspiration, altered amounts and patterns of suspended sediment
  loadings, fire, oxidation of organic sediments, and the physical effects of
  wave energy (Mitsch and Gosselink, 1986; IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 6). </p>
<p>There are many highly significant social and economic threats to wetlands,
  but there is insufficient information on the precise nature of anticipated local
  changes in climate. This difficulty prevents accurate assessment of risks or
  opportunities to adapt. The responses of affected wetlands are expected to vary;
  they might include migration of the wetland area along river edges or the slope
  of a receding lake and/or altered species composition. More serious effects
  would include altered physical characteristics; degradation to a simpler, less
  diverse form; or complete destruction. There also could be a loss of desired
  attributes, such as their ability to provide suitable habitat for particular
  species; their ability to act as a feeding or breeding area in support of an
  adjacent open-water commercial or recreational fishery; or their ability to
  buffer occasional flooding (Mitsch and Gosselink, 1986; IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter
  6). Altering climate and acid depositions can cause declining levels of dissolved
  organic carbon (DOC) in wetlands-thus increasing the water volumes, sediment
  areas, and associated organisms exposed to harmful ultraviolet-B (UV-B) irradiation.
  Potential effects include changes in aquatic communities and photoinhibition
  of phytoplankton (Schindler et al., 1996; Yan et al., 1996). </p>
<p><i>Additional losses of prairie pothole wetlands could reduce migratory waterfowl
  and wildlife populations. </i></p>
<p>Occupying depressions in the landscape in dry climates with small watershed
  areas, prairie pothole wetlands are highly susceptible to a lack of moisture
  occurring through the effects of decreased snowpack and associated spring recharge,
  droughts, and increased climatic variability. Already strained by losses of
  71% in Canada (Environment Canada 1986, 1988) and 50-60% in the United States
  (Leitch, 1981), this area yields 50-75% of all the waterfowl produced in any
  year in North America (Leitch and Danielson, 1979; Weller, 1981). Trends in
  Canadian duck abundance already reflect the interactions between changing wetness
  regimes and landscape alterations (Bethke and Nudds, 1995). Any additional stress
  would be of great concern and could be accommodated only through active programs
  to protect, enhance, and increase wetland areas in this region. </p>
<p><i>Increases in the frequency or magnitude of extreme hydrological events could
  result in water quality deterioration and water management problems. </i></p>
<p>Hydrological variability (i.e., the frequency and magnitude of extreme events)
  is an extremely important issue for the management of water resources. Under
  a warmer climate, the hydrological cycle is projected to become more intense,
  leading to more heavy rainfall events (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 6.5.6). Several
  2xCO<sub>2</sub> GCM simulations have indicated an increase in the magnitude of mean rainfall
  events, particularly for central and northWest North America, even with small
  changes in mean annual rainfall (Cubasch et al., 1995; Gregory and Mitchell,
  1995; Mearns et al., 1995; IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 6.5.7). In addition, these
  simulations indicate increases in the length of dry spells (consecutive days
  without precipitation). However, few model simulation analyses have addressed
  the issue of variability in daily precipitation and increases in the frequency
  or severity of extreme hydrological events; as a result, issues surrounding
  variability and extreme hydrological events remain highly uncertain at this
  time. </p>
<p>In many regions, projected increases in hydrological variability would result
  in greater impacts on water resources than changes in mean hydrological conditions
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 10 Executive Summary). Increases in the frequency
  or magnitude of extreme rainfall events would likely have their greatest impacts
  on water resources in the winter and spring, when the ground is frozen or soil
  moisture levels are high; severe flooding may be more likely. More severe or
  frequent floods could result in increased erosion of the land surface, as well
  as stream channels and banks; higher sediment loads and increased sedimentation
  of rivers and reservoirs; and increased loadings of nutrients and contaminants
  from agricultural and urban areas (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.5.5). Longer
  dry spells would likely have their greatest impact in the summer, when streamflows
  generally are low. Increases in the severity of summer droughts could result
  in reduced water quality (e.g., lower dissolved oxygen concentrations, reduced
  dilution of effluents) and impaired biological habitat (e.g., drying of streams,
  expansion of zones with low dissolved oxygen concentrations, water temperatures
  exceeding thermal tolerances) (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 10.5.3 and 10.5.4).
</p>
<p>Projected increases in hydrological variability (e.g., more frequent or larger
  floods) could lead to increased expenditures for flood management and disaster
  assistance (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 14.4.3). Flood-control structures might
  require modifications to accommodate larger probable maximum-flow events. Alternatives
  to structural flood-control measures can be instituted to reduce risk at a lower
  cost to society, but these strategies require significant political will. Even
  with the high frequency of extreme events that have occurred recently (and their
  attendant costs), changes to less-costly and more effective nonstructural methods
  of risk reduction are slow in gaining acceptance. Navigation also might be impaired
  by changes in hydrological variability, as illustrated by severe restrictions
  on navigation in the Mississippi River during the drought of 1988 (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Section 14.3.4). Hydropower generation could be severely restricted during
  droughts. It is estimated that hydropower production might decline 20% during
  the peak-load summer months in northern California as a result of more severe
  droughts (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 14.3.3). More severe summer droughts also
  could increase agricultural irrigation demands (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 14.3.1)
  and exacerbate current drinking water supply problems in some large urbanized
  areas, such as California and Houston, Texas (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 12.3.5).

<p><i>Lake water levels could decline in regions such as the Arctic and the Great
  Lakes where precipitation increases do not compensate for warming-enhanced evaporation
  rate increases.</i> </p>
