<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Some adaptation will occur if better information concerning the risks posed
  by climate change is available and the appropriate signals are available from
  the marketplace. Over periods of half a century or more, many sectors will change
  significantly, and new products, markets, and technologies will emerge. In the
  transportation industry, for example, nominal replacement cycles are 10-20 years
  for transit vehicles and 35-70 years for most infrastructure (National Council
  on Public Works Improvement, 1988). Turnover of capital stock provides the opportunity
  to adapt easily if information is available. Given uncertainties, however, autonomous
  adaptation signaled by the marketplace cannot be relied upon entirely for long-lived
  public transportation and other infrastructure. Governments may have to set
  a suitable policy framework, disseminate information about climate change, and
  act directly in relation to vulnerable infrastructures. For example, effective
  land-use regulation (zoning and building codes) can help reduce vulnerabilities
  by directing population shifts away from vulnerable locations such as floodplains,
  steep hillsides, and low-lying coastlines. Research is needed to better understand
  the factors that affect effective adaptive capacity and how those factors vary
  within North America. </p>
<p>Some forms of adaptation, such as those in the areas of fire prevention and
  water supply-and-demand balancing, will likely be advantageous regardless of
  climate regime. Examples would include major adaptive responses in fire-control
  systems in rural areas-such as controlled burns to limit fuel, fire breaks,
  aerial fire retardant delivery, and rural fire departments and "smoke jumpers"-and
  short-term activity controls during high fire-danger weather, such as prohibitions
  on open burning, commercial activities such as logging, and recreation activities
  such as hiking, hunting, or use of off-road vehicles. If the frequency or intensity
  of fire danger warrants, other potential adaptive responses involve improved
  spatial planning of communities and some longer-term land-use controls. These
  strategies would provide better isolation of fires and could limit damage to
  human settlements even under current conditions. </p>
<p>In the energy supply sector, anticipation of possible regional climate changes
  will be important in the design of and site selection for solar and wind energy
  systems, as well as energy transportation systems. For example, possible thawing
  of permafrost in Arctic regions may require changes in the design of oil pipelines
  to avoid slumping, breaks, and leaks (Brown, 1989; Anderson et al., 1994). Systems
  with long lifetimes, such as large hydroelectric impoundment systems, will have
  difficulty adjusting in the absence of long-term predictions. Future biomass
  energy farms, however, are likely to be intensively managed and have short crop
  rotation; therefore, they would be better able to adapt to changing conditions
  through choices of crops and management techniques. </p>
<p>For energy demand, building design can assist adaptation. Increased building-shell
  efficiency and changes to building design that reduce air-conditioning load
  show promise (Scott et al., 1994). Though effective, however, adaptive strategies
  are not implemented without costs (Loveland and Brown, 1990). Reducing the size
  of space-heating capacity in response to warmer climate would be a logical adaptive
  response in more temperate and polar countries and may free up investment funds
  for other purposes, even within the energy sector. Community design to reduce
  heat islands (through judicious use of vegetation and light-colored surfaces)
  (Akbari et al., 1992), reducing motor transportation, and taking advantage of
  solar resources also may be viable and would have sustainability benefits. </p>
