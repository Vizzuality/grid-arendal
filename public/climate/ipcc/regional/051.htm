<p>One of the direct effects of global warming will be a change in the extent
  of sea ice-which will have the beneficial effect of increasing the extent of
  many aquatic species but may negatively impact one of the areas most important
  for primary production: the ice edge. For some species, this change would be
  beneficial because it would allow greater penetration of light and freer movement.
  The absence of ice over the continental shelf of the Arctic Ocean would produce
  a sharp rise in the productivity of this region, provided that a sufficient
  supply of nutrients is maintained. For other species, there appear to be significant
  disadvantages. For example, in southern latitudes, warming could affect pack-ice
  movement and timing and reduce its extent, in turn affecting the distribution
  and reducing the abundance and productivity of krill. Krill is the fundamental
  link in the food web of the Southern Ocean. Changes in wind strength, the effects
  of the Antarctic Convergence, and the west-east and east-west surface currents
  of the Southern Ocean also may affect productivity in the ice edge zone (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 16.2.2.2). </p>
<p>In the polar regions, the seasonal development and regression of sea ice is
  of substantial biological importance (in addition to its profound role in global
  ocean-atmosphere exchange of heat, water, and gases). Blooms of phytoplankton
  at the ice edge, induced by upwelling of nutrient-rich water and/or the stabilizing
  effect of melting icewater, are significant at high latitudes in both hemispheres.
  Changes in the extent and thickness of ice affect the timing, magnitude, and
  duration of the seasonal pulse of primary production in polar regions. The composition
  of the marine ecosystem depends on the mode of sea-ice formation. These changes
  in turn affect the quantity and quality of food available to grazers and the
  timing and magnitude of vertical flux of carbon and other elements. Such series
  of events are particularly important in highly productive systems such as the
  Bering Sea, where a 5% reduction in sea ice has been observed over the past
  decade. </p>
<p>UV-B radiation may directly affect fish and their larvae, phytoplankton, and
  krill. The development and survival of some species are at apparent threshold
  levels at current UV-B levels. Significant changes in ecosystem function and
  functioning could occur as species sensitive to UV-B radiation are replaced
  by more resistant species (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 16.2.7). Experimental results
  have shown damaging effects on aquatic organisms from polar regions, particularly
  on phytoplankton (photosystem damage, DNA damage, modifications in nutrient
  uptake, changes in species composition, etc.), but a series of internal and
  external protective mechanisms (synthesis of photoprotective pigments, DNA repair
  mechanisms, vertical mixing in the water column, etc.) may counteract these
  negative effects (Vincent and Roy, 1993). On the other hand, large-scale ice
  retreat due to global warming would increase the exposure to UV-B radiation
  in the water column during the maximum development of the ozone hole (September-October).
  However, the solar angle during the spring period is very low. This factor may
  minimize the penetration of UV-B radiation in the water column, thus reducing
  harmful effects on the biota (Arrigo, 1994; McMinn et al., 1994). Thus, care
  should be taken in extrapolating experimental results to the real world. More
  in situ studies and modeling efforts are necessary to assess the effects of
  increased UV-B radiation during ozone hole episodes. </p>
<p>In the Arctic, mean levels of ozone have decreased. In addition, smaller, less
  well-understood ozone-depletion events, or mini-ozone holes, have occurred.
  Presently, Arctic ozone-depletion events are not sufficiently understood, and
  whether they will increase in severity also is not clear. However, there is
  some indication that ozone depletion in the Arctic is tied closely to global
  warming and the accompanying cooling of the Arctic stratosphere. Arctic ozone-depletion
  events are most prevalent in the spring when biological activity is highly sensitive
  to UV-B radiation. Increased levels are likely to affect human populations as
  well as aquatic and terrestrial species and ecosystems. </p>
<p>Warming, changes in upwellings, circulation variations, and wind changes would
  affect the distribution and characteristics of polynyas (ice-free areas) and
  ice edges that are vital to polar ecosystems. Predicted climate change also
  may have important impacts on marine mammals such as whales, dolphins, and seals
  and seabirds such as cormorants, penguins, storm petrels, and albatross. Geographic
  centers of food production will most certainly shift. Underlying primary productivity
  will change due to changes in upwelling, loss of ice-edge effects, and ocean
  temperatures. Changes in critical habitats such as sea ice (due to climate warming)
  and nesting and rearing beaches (due to sea-level rise) will occur. Diseases
  and production of oceanic biotoxins due to warming temperatures and shifts in
  coastal currents will increase (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 8.3.2). However, it
  is presently impossible to predict the magnitude and significance of these impacts.
  Recent changes in the penguin population on the Antarctic Peninsula have been
  related to climate warming (Fraser et al., 1992), but should also be interpreted
  in the context of penguin rookery variations that have occurred in the past
  (Baroni and Orombelli, 1994). Penguin are a good example for illustrating the
  vulnerability and complex responses of Antarctic ecosystems to climate, environmental,
  and ecosystem changes. </p>
