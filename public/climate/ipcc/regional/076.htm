<h4>4.3.3. Food and Fiber Production </h4>
<p><i>Summary: Significant impacts on agriculture are likely, including crop and
  pasture performance increases from CO<sub>2</sub> rises; mixed effects of temperature rises;
  changes in soil fertility; changes in quality of grain and pasture nutrition;
  shifts in the suitability of districts for particular crops, such as kiwifruit;
  and possibly increased problems with weeds, pests, and diseases</i>. </p>
<p><i>Impacts will vary widely from district to district, crop to crop, and decade
  to decade. Grain crops may gain in the first few decades because of the immediate
  beneficial effect of higher CO<sub>2</sub>, but that advantage may be eroded as the delayed
  rise in temperature becomes greater and reduces the grain-filling period. In
  Australia's warm low latitudes, some crops are near their maximum temperature
  tolerance and are likely to suffer increasingly as the temperature increases.
  The possibility of overall decreased rainfall in Australia would negatively
  affect rangeland pastoralism and irrigated agriculture (which is a major source
  of production). Any changes in global production, and hence international food
  commodity prices, would have major economic impacts. </i></p>
<p><i>Farming in the region is well adapted to dealing with variability and change
  through a variety of natural and market factors-for example, by means of plant
  breeding, diversification, seasonal climate prediction, and so forth. Such techniques
  are likely to be sufficient to adapt to climate change over the next few decades;
  in some cases these techniques may facilitate expanded production. As the time
  horizon extends, however, the changing climate is likely to become less favorable
  to agricultural production in Australia, leading to a long-term increase in
  vulnerability. </i></p>
<p><i>Production forestry will be affected by changes in tree productivity; forest
  operational conditions; and pests, weeds, disease, and wildfire incidence. The
  net impact is not clear. The longer time to reach maturity results in a relatively
  large exposure to financial loss from extreme events, fire, or any rapid change
  in climate conditions. </i></p>
<p><i>A number of climate sensitivities have been identified for fisheries, but
  the impacts cannot be predicted with any confidence. It appears that freshwater
  and near-shore fisheries will be more affected than open-ocean fisheries. The
  principal adaptation option is scientifically based integrated fisheries management
  and coastal zone management. </i></p>
