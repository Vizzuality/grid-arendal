<h4>5.3.3.2. Hydrology and Water Management </h4>
<p>The main components of the hydrological cycle are precipitation, evaporation,
  discharge, storage in reservoirs, groundwater, and soil. Because of many complex
  interactions between these factors in time and in space, changes in the hydrological
  cycle are more difficult to model and to analyze than temperature and precipitation
  data. A detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this paper (see IPCC 1996,
  WG I, Chapter 3; IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 10). </p>
<p>Potential changes in the hydrological cycle are easier to understand if some
  basic mechanisms are kept in mind. Generally, higher temperatures lead to higher
  potential evaporation and decreased discharge (which also is a function of precipitation,
  storage, and topography). The storage of water in the soil serves as a buffer;
  in winter and spring, increasing precipitation normally generates higher discharge
  because the buffer is full and evaporation is low. During the summer, storage
  is reduced by evapotranspiration and must be refilled before discharge begins.
  Changes in the hydrological cycle therefore are more variable than changes in
  other climatic factors. Seasonal-to-interannual variability in precipitation
  and temperature also accounts for some of the variability in hydrological characteristics
  in European river basins. </p>
<p>The hydrological cycle in Europe is strongly influenced by anthropogenic factors.
  During the past century, land-use patterns have changed, the drainage conditions
  of rivers and land have been altered, the proportion of impermeable (urban)
  areas has increased, and additional reservoirs have been built. Changes or trends
  in the discharge of rivers therefore are more difficult to analyze than temperature
  and precipitation trends, especially in densely populated areas (Forch et al.,
  1996; Holt and Jones, 1996; Giakoumakis and Baloutsos, 1997). </p>
<p>GCM-based analyses for the European continent (IPCC 1996, WG II, Table 10-1)
  give a range of possible responses of river runoff in a warmer global climate-from
  decreases in some regions (e.g., Hungary, Greece) to increases in other regions
  (United Kingdom, Finland, Ukraine); these estimates are a function of precipitation,
  evapotranspiration, and soil moisture projections in the different GCMs. The
  uncertainties of climate model results, however, remain very large in terms
  of hydrological forecasting, particularly at the regional scale. This limitation
  is particularly critical for water management practices in the future because
  water resource impacts occur at the local scale, not at regional or larger scales.
</p>
<p>The river basin is the natural spatial unit for water resource management;
  because neighboring river basins can have quite different climate change impacts,
  making quantitative statements about regional-scale climate impacts on water
  resources is difficult given that many regions include a wide range of hydroclimatic
  regions. The results of catchment-scale simulations with conventional hydrological
  models driven by GCM data therefore are highly variable. Arnell and Reynard
  (1996), for example, simulated changes of �20% in annual runoff for 21 catchments
  in Great Britain-with a tendency toward lower amounts of discharge, especially
  in sensitive areas and during the summer months. </p>
<p>Another consequence of increasing temperatures is a change in the distribution
  of water in the landscape. Especially in flat regions (e.g., lowlands in The
  Netherlands and northern Germany), catchment areas depend on groundwater recharge.
  Changes in percolation therefore can change the size of catchments (Hoermann
  et al., 1995). On a local catchment scale, distribution of water in the landscape
  can change even if annual discharge remains unchanged: Whereas hilltops are
  severely stressed by drought, areas with high groundwater levels may remain
  largely unaffected. </p>
<p>The effects on different regions of Europe can be classified according to the
  climatic gradients from north to south and from west to east (the maritime-to-continental
  gradient). According to current and projected distributions of rainfall, there
  may be an increase in summer drought. Observed precipitation shows a decrease
  in summer and an increase in winter and spring. Such a change is likely to affect
  mainly areas that already are sensitive to drought: the southern and continental
  parts of Europe, especially the Mediterranean region. Additional consumption
  of water for irrigation may create additional depletion of water reservoirs
  and groundwater. </p>
<p>Although the debate about changes in the frequency of floods is still open,
  an increase in rainfall during periods when soils are saturated (i.e., winter
  and spring), along with earlier snowmelt, could increase the frequency and severity
  in floods. An increase in large-scale precipitation might lead to increased
  flood risks on large river basins in western Europe in winter. The increased
  temperatures expected in summer could lead to higher local precipitation extremes
  and associated flood risks in small catchment areas. </p>
<p>Another unknown factor is the effect of increased plant water-use efficiency
  (WUE) resulting from increased CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. Under laboratory and greenhouse
  conditions, plants seem to use less water for constant yield or exhibit higher
  productivity. In the field, however, predictions of WUE at the catchment or
  even ecosystem level are not yet feasible. In water-limited systems (e.g., in
  the Mediterranean region), a higher WUE can increase or maintain productivity-whereas
  in the humid areas of northern Europe, it could theoretically decrease evaporation
  and therefore increase discharge. </p>
<p>Warmer average and extreme temperatures will enhance the demand for freshwater,
  particularly for agriculture and direct human consumption, although the water-quality
  requirements are different for these two types of consumption. Changes in precipitation
  patterns, particularly over regions that already are sensitive (e.g., the Mediterranean
  basin), may lead to increased demand for water for irrigation purposes, especially
  for soils with low water-storage capacities. If precipitation were to undergo
  a decline in the Mediterranean basin (which is not always the case suggested
  by GCM simulations), countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece would face substantially
  increased risks of summer water shortages. In such a situation, increases in
  storage capacity would be needed to maintain existing water and energy supplies.
  The Netherlands could face the desiccation of most of its wetland areas or be
  forced increasingly to rely on the Rhine to maintain present water levels. Groundwater
  aquifers could be affected by increased saltwater intrusion as sea level rises.
  Given a possible 4�C temperature increase and a rise in the Alpine snow line
  of 500-700 m in the summer, the flow of the Rhine could decline by 10% during
  this season. A temperature increase of only 0.5�C and a daily rainfall decrease
  of a few percent would decrease runoff in Hungary by 25-30%. Despite projected
  wetter winters, drier summers and increased evaporation in southeastern England
  may reduce yields in impounding reservoirs by 8-15%. Aquifer yields, which are
  very important to the London area, may fall by 8%. Supplies of water during
  warmer, possibly drier, summers would need to be maintained through larger storage
  or transfers from wetter regions. Water quality may deteriorate because there
  would be less river flow to dilute contaminants. </p>
<p>In terms of water management, system yields of river basins are likely to decrease
  as a result of changes in flow patterns; these river basins certainly will be
  sensitive to expected increases in floods and droughts. There may be a potential
  for conflict over environmental and economic uses of freshwater, especially
  for river basins that are shared by several countries. The high population density
  in western Europe does not allow for much flexibility for major changes in flood-protection
  practices. Floodplains in most countries already are overpopulated; thus, it
  will be extremely difficult to find the necessary areas for an effective flood-protection
  system. </p>
