<h4>7.2.2. Observed Precipitation and Future Projections </h4>
<p>Rainfall is low in most of the region, but it is highly variable seasonally
  and interannually. Average monthly rainfall ranges from 0 mm to 200 mm in January
  and from 0 mm to 500 mm in July (Oxford World Atlas, 1994). There was no discernible
  trend in annual precipitation during 1901-95 for the region as a whole (see
  <a href="305.htm">Annex
  A</a>, <a href="305.htm#figureA-9">Figure A-9</a>), nor in most
  parts of the region-except in the southWestern part of the Arabian peninsula,
  where there was a 200% increase (see <a href="305.htm">Annex
  A</a>, <a href="305.htm#figureA-1">Figure
  A-1</a>). This increase, however, is in relation to a very low base rainfall
  (<200 mm/yr). Precipitation tends to be very seasonal; in the Middle East countries,
  for example, precipitation occurs during winter, and the summer dry period lasts
  for 5-9 months (UNEP, 1997). </p>
<p>Winter precipitation is projected to increase slightly (<0.5 mm/day) throughout
  the region; summer precipitation is projected to remain the same in the northeastern
  part of the region and increase (0.5-1 mm/day) in the southWest (i.e., the southern
  part of the Arabian peninsula). These projected changes vary, however, from
  model to model and are unlikely to be significant. </p>
<h4>7.2.3. Observed Moisture Availability and Future Projections<a name="moisture"></a></h4>
<p>Soil moisture is projected to decrease in most parts of the region because
  projected precipitation increases are small and evaporation will increase with
  rising temperatures (IPCC 1996, WG I, Figure 6.12). </p>
<p>The ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration (P:PET) is a measure
  of moisture availability and an indicator of the type of vegetation that an
  area can support. The Middle East and Arid Asian region has a P:PET ratio in
  the range of 0.01-1.6; most of the area has a value of <0.45-typical of semi-arid
  and arid climates that support grasslands, shrublands, and some woodlands. Projected
  changes in P:PET for different model runs show no consistent trend (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Chapter 14): Some models project a decrease (greater aridity) and some
  an increase. The lack of data specifically from the arid and semi-arid regions
  may contribute to this uncertainty. </p>
<h1>7.3. Sensitivities, Adaptations, and Vulnerabilities of Key Sectors<a name="sens"></a></h1>
<p>This section discusses the region's major vulnerabilities-particularly those
  that apply to large parts of the region; many impacts are common to the region
  as a whole. Later in the section, some sector-specific impacts (e.g., those
  affecting agriculture or uplands), adaptations, and vulnerabilities for smaller
  parts of the region are highlighted. </p>
<h4>7.3.1. General Impacts<a name="gen"></a> </h4>
<p>The region is mostly semi-arid and arid, with significant areas of extreme
  aridity (i.e., deserts, as defined in IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 3). All areas
  experience wide fluctuations in rainfall, and their native plants and animals
  are adapted to coping with sequences of extreme climatic conditions. In many
  of these ecological systems, the initial climatic changes are unlikely to create
  conditions significantly outside the present range of variation (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Chapter 3); thus, impacts from climate change may not be apparent for
  several decades. </p>
<p>Models that project changes in global vegetation in response to a doubled-CO<sub>2</sub>-driven
  climate suggest little change in desert (arid) communities. One study, which
  used four general circulation model (GCM) climate projections, concluded that
  deserts were the most stable of the 16 vegetation types considered (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Chapter 3); it estimated that only 59-66% of all combined vegetation
  types for the world would remain in the same category, whereas 82-92% of existing
  deserts would retain this classification. The impact of climate change may be
  greater in the semi-arid areas of the region than in the arid areas. Agriculture,
  natural grasslands, livestock, and water resources in marginal areas are most
  likely to be vulnerable to climate change (Smith et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Although precipitation is projected by some models to increase slightly, this
  increase will have little impact because most of the region will remain arid.
  In rangelands or semi-arid lands, increased precipitation eventually may lead
  to improved soil conditions, including larger accumulations of organic matter,
  improved soil field capacity, enhanced moisture availability, and changed runoff
  patterns (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 3). This process is slow (taking 400 years
  or more), however, so little advantage will accrue to these ecosystems during
  the next century. A more important process may be the demonstrated increase
  in the water-use efficiency of plants when high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> are present in
  the atmosphere (Bazzaz et al., 1996). In atmospheres rich in CO<sub>2</sub>, plants can
  take up the CO<sub>2</sub> necessary for photosynthesis with less water loss from their
  stomatal pores. This efficiency gain has been demonstrated to be most advantageous
  in plants growing in water-limited circumstances-and thus may lead to higher
  productivity throughout much of the region. The response of individual species
  and communities varies considerably, however. In high-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, some species
  conserve water by using less water to maintain previous rates of productivity
  (i.e., photosynthesis); other species increase their productivity and maintain
  relatively high rates of water use. There is little understanding about how
  whole communities of plants respond, and, unfortunately, few studies have been
  done within the region. Nevertheless, the net result of increased water-use
  efficiency should be increased plant productivity in arid and semi-arid ecosystems;
  this effect probably will outweigh any direct effects stemming from increased
  precipitation resulting from climate change. </p>
<p>The processes associated with changed climatic and atmospheric conditions are
  expected to lead to changes in the composition of many plant communities-such
  as the mix between grasses and shrubs or weeds and non-weeds (IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Chapters 2 and 3). There also is evidence that the forage quality (e.g.,
  the ratio of nitrogen to carbon) and the protein content of some cereals may
  decline. Although it has not been possible to test the effects of high CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres
  on extensive areas of crops and pastures with large grazing animals (Diaz, 1995),
  it is possible that they may affect farm management systems significantly. </p>
<p>Even where wetter conditions prevail, however, any "greening" of the deserts
  and rangelands often might be counteracted by pressure from the expanding human
  population and associated desertification problems. Climatic conditions and
  social pressures vary greatly in a region that ranges from Mediterranean climate
  to extreme deserts, with economies as varied as those of the oil producing states,
  Israel, and the countries of the FSU. In the latter group of countries, the
  impacts of climate change are likely to be relatively small compared with the
  impacts of economic transitions on agricultural systems and the environment
  (see <a href="163.htm#food">Section 7.3.4.1</a>). </p>
