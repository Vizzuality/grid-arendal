<h1>Food and Fiber Production</h1>
<p>Currently, 800 million people are malnourished; as the world's population increases
  and incomes in some countries rise, food consumption is expected to double over
  the next three to four decades. The most recent doubling in food production
  occurred over a 25-year period and was based on irrigation, chemical inputs,
  and high-yielding crop varieties. Whether the remarkable gains of the past 25
  years will be repeated is uncertain: Problems associated with intensifying production
  on land already in use (e.g., chemical and biological runoff, waterlogging and
  salinization of soils, soil erosion and compaction) are becoming increasingly
  evident. Expanding the amount of land under cultivation (including reducing
  land deliberately taken out of production to reduce agricultural output) also
  is an option for increasing total crop production, but it could lead to increases
  in competition for land and pressure on natural ecosystems, increased agricultural
  emissions of greenhouse gases, a reduction in natural sinks of carbon, and expansion
  of agriculture to marginal lands-all of which could undermine the ability to
  sustainably support increased agricultural production. </p>
<p>Changes in climate will interact with stresses that result from actions to
  increase agricultural production, affecting crop yields and productivity in
  different ways, depending on the types of agricultural practices and systems
  in place. The main direct effects will be through changes in factors such as
  temperature, precipitation, length of growing season, and timing of extreme
  or critical threshold events relative to crop development, as well as through
  changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (which may have a beneficial effect
  on the growth of many crop types). Indirect effects will include potentially
  detrimental changes in diseases, pests, and weeds, the effects of which have
  not yet been quantified in most available studies. Evidence continues to support
  the findings of the IPCC SAR that "global agricultural production could be maintained
  relative to baseline production" for a growing population under 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium
  climate conditions. In addition, the regional findings of this special report
  lend support to concerns over the "potential serious consequences" of increased
  risk of hunger in some regions, particularly the tropics and subtropics. Generally,
  middle to high latitudes may experience increases in productivity, depending
  on crop type, growing season, changes in temperature regimes, and the seasonality
  of precipitation. In the tropics and subtropics-where some crops are near their
  maximum temperature tolerance and where dryland, nonirrigated agriculture predominates-yields
  are likely to decrease. The livelihoods of subsistence farmers and pastoral
  peoples, who make up a large portion of rural populations in some regions, also
  could be negatively affected. In regions where there is a likelihood of decreased
  rainfall, agriculture could be significantly affected. </p>
<p>Fisheries and fish production are sensitive to changes in climate and currently
  are at risk from overfishing, diminishing nursery areas, and extensive inshore
  and coastal pollution. Globally, marine fisheries production is expected to
  remain about the same in response to changes in climate; high-latitude freshwater
  and aquaculture production is likely to increase, assuming that natural climate
  variability and the structure and strength of ocean currents remain about the
  same. The principal impacts will be felt at the national and local levels, as
  centers of production shift. The positive effects of climate change-such as
  longer growing seasons, lower natural winter mortality, and faster growth rates
  in higher latitudes-may be offset by negative factors such as changes in established
  reproductive patterns, migration routes, and ecosystem relationships. </p>
<p>Given the many forces bringing profound changes to the agricultural sector,
  adaptation options that enhance resilience to current natural climate variability
  and potential changes in means and extremes and address other concerns (e.g.,
  soil erosion, salinization) offer no- or low-regret options. For example, linking
  agricultural management to seasonal climate predictions can assist in incremental
  adaptation, particularly in regions where climate is strongly affected by ENSO
  conditions. The suitability of these options for different regions varies, in
  part because of differences in the financial and institutional ability of the
  private sector and governments in different regions to implement them. Adaptation
  options include changes in crops and crop varieties, development of new crop
  varieties, changes in planting schedules and tillage practices, introduction
  of new biotechnologies, and improved water-management and irrigation systems,
  which have high capital costs and are limited by availability of water resources.
  Other options, such as minimum- and reduced-tillage technologies, do not require
  such extensive capitalization but do require high levels of agricultural training
  and support. </p>
<p>In regions where agriculture is well adapted to current climate variability
  and/or where market and institutional factors are in place to redistribute agricultural
  surpluses to make up for shortfalls, vulnerability to changes in climate means
  and extremes generally is low. However, in regions where agriculture is unable
  to cope with existing extremes, where markets and institutions to facilitate
  redistribution of deficits and surpluses are not in place, and/or where adaptation
  resources are limited, the vulnerability of the agricultural sector to climate
  change should be considered high. Other factors also will influence the vulnerability
  of agricultural production in a particular country or region to climate change-including
  the extent to which current temperatures or precipitation patterns are close
  to or exceed tolerance limits for important crops; per capita income; the percentage
  of economic activity based on agricultural production; and the preexisting condition
  of the agricultural land base. </p>
