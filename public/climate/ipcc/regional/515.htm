<h1>Tropical Asia</h1>
<p>Tropical Asia is physiographically diverse and ecologically rich in natural
  and crop-related biodiversity. The present total population of the region is
  about 1.6 billion, and it is projected to increase to 2.4 billion by 2025. The
  population is principally rural-based, although in 1995, the region included
  6 of the 25 largest cities in the world. The climate in Tropical Asia is characterized
  by seasonal weather patterns associated with the two monsoons and the occurrence
  of tropical cyclones in the three core areas of cyclogenesis (the Bay of Bengal,
  north Pacific Ocean, and South China Sea). Climate change will add to other
  stresses such as rapid urbanization, industrialization, and economic development,
  which contribute to unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, increased
  pollution, land degradation, and other environmental problems. </p>
<p><i>Ecosystems</i>: Substantial elevational shifts of ecosystems in the mountains
  and uplands of Tropical Asia are projected. At high elevation, weedy species
  can be expected to displace tree species-though the rates of vegetation change
  could be slow compared to the rate of climate change and constrained by increased
  erosion in the Greater Himalayas. Changes in the distribution and health of
  rainforest and drier monsoon forest will be complex. In Thailand, for instance,
  the area of tropical forest could increase from 45% to 80% of total forest cover,
  whereas in Sri Lanka, a significant increase in dry forest and a decrease in
  wet forest could occur. Projected increases in evapotranspiration and rainfall
  variability are likely to have a negative impact on the viability of freshwater
  wetlands, resulting in shrinkage and desiccation. Sea-level rise and increases
  in sea-surface temperature are the most probable major climate change-related
  stresses on coastal ecosystems. Coral reefs may be able to keep up with the
  rate of sea-level rise but suffer bleaching from higher temperatures. Landward
  migration of mangroves and tidal wetlands is expected to be constrained by human
  infrastructure and human activities. </p>
<p><i>Hydrology and Water Resources</i>: The Himalayas have a critical role in
  the provision of water to continental monsoon Asia. Increased temperatures and
  increased seasonal variability in precipitation are expected to result in increased
  recession of glaciers and increasing danger from glacial lake outburst floods.
  A reduction in average flow of snow-fed rivers, coupled with an increase in
  peak flows and sediment yield, would have major impacts on hydropower generation,
  urban water supply, and agriculture. Availability of water from snow-fed rivers
  may increase in the short term but decrease in the long run. Runoff from rain-fed
  rivers may change in the future. A reduction in snowmelt water will put the
  dry-season flow of these rivers under more stress than is the case now. Increased
  population and increasing demand in the agricultural, industrial, and hydropower
  sectors will put additional stress on water resources. Pressure on the drier
  river basins and those subject to low seasonal flows will be most acute. Hydrological
  changes in island and coastal drainage basins are expected to be relatively
  small in comparison to those in continental Tropical Asia, apart from those
  associated with sea-level rise. </p>
<p><i>Food and Fiber Production</i>: The sensitivity of major cereal and tree
  crops to changes in temperature, moisture, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of the magnitudes
  projected for the region has been demonstrated in many studies. For instance,
  impacts on rice yield, wheat yield, and sorghum yield suggest that any increase
  in production associated with CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization will be more than offset by
  reductions in yield from temperature or moisture changes. Although climate change
  impacts could result in significant changes in crop yields, production, storage,
  and distribution, the net effect of the changes regionwide is uncertain because
  of varietal differences; local differences in growing season, crop management,
  etc.; the lack of inclusion of possible diseases, pests, and microorganisms
  in crop model simulations; and the vulnerability of agricultural areas to episodic
  environmental hazards, including floods, droughts, and cyclones. Low-income
  rural populations that depend on traditional agricultural systems or on marginal
  lands are particularly vulnerable. </p>
<p><i>Coastal Systems</i>: Coastal lands are particularly vulnerable; sea-level
  rise is the most obvious climate-related impact. Densely settled and intensively
  used low-lying coastal plains, islands, and deltas are especially vulnerable
  to coastal erosion and land loss, inundation and sea flooding, upstream movement
  of the saline/freshwater front, and seawater intrusion into freshwater lenses.
  Especially at risk are large delta regions of Bangladesh, Myanmar, Viet Nam,
  and Thailand, and the low-lying areas of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia.
  Socioeconomic impacts could be felt in major cities and ports, tourist resorts,
  artisinal and commercial fishing, coastal agriculture, and infrastructure development.
  International studies have projected the displacement of several millions of
  people from the region's coastal zone, assuming a 1-m rise in sea level. The
  costs of response measures to reduce the impact of sea-level rise in the region
  could be immense. </p>
<p><i>Human Health</i>: The incidence and extent of some vector-borne diseases
  are expected to increase with global warming. Malaria, schistosomiasis, and
  dengue-which are significant causes of mortality and morbidity in Tropical Asia-are
  very sensitive to climate and are likely to spread into new regions on the margins
  of presently endemic areas as a consequence of climate change. Newly affected
  populations initially would experience higher fatality rates. According to one
  study that specifically focused on climate influences on infectious disease
  in presently vulnerable regions, an increase in epidemic potential of 12-27%
  for malaria and 31-47% for dengue and a decrease of schistosomiasis of 11-17%
  are anticipated under a range of GCM scenarios as a consequence of climate change.
  Waterborne and water-related infectious diseases, which already account for
  the majority of epidemic emergencies in the region, also are expected to increase
  when higher temperatures and higher humidity are superimposed on existing conditions
  and projected increases in population, urbanization, declining water quality,
  and other trends. </p>
<p><i>Conclusions</i>: The potential direct effects of climate change assessed
  here, such as changes in water availability, crop yields, and inundation of
  coastal areas, all will have further indirect effects on food security and human
  health. The suitability of adaptation strategies to different climatic environments
  will vary across the diverse subregions and land uses of the region. Adaptive
  options include new temperature- and pest-resistant crop varieties; new technologies
  to reduce crop yield loss; improvements in irrigation efficiency; and integrated
  approaches to river basin and coastal zone management that take account of current
  and longer-term issues, including climate change. </p>
