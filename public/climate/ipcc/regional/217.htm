<p><i>Because salmonid species (and other anadromous species such as striped bass)
  rely on marine and freshwater aquatic systems at different points in their life
  cycles, projected changes in marine and freshwater water temperatures, ocean
  currents, and freshwater flows are more likely to impact growth, survival, reproduction,
  and spatial distribution of these species than of other fish species. </i></p>
<p>Because of their anadromous life history, pink salmon are affected by changes
  in freshwater and changes in the ocean-and the impacts in each of these habitats
  are equally important. Recent research has shown that trends in pink salmon
  productivity shift in response to climate-driven changes in the ocean. Because
  the mortality of young pink salmon is so high (95-98%) shortly after they first
  enter the ocean, small changes in marine survival can result in large changes
  in adult returns. </p>
<p>Warmer freshwater and oceans and changes in the pattern of Fraser River flows
  probably will reduce the abundance of pink salmon, although individual size
  may increase because of improved growth in the warmer water. Warmer temperatures
  will reduce incubation time, and the longer period in fresh water will improve
  growth. In the smaller rivers, where flows are a function of winter precipitation,
  increased precipitation may increase water flows-resulting in higher egg and
  alevin mortality. Dracup et al. (1992) examined the effect of climate change
  in altering the timing of streamflow regimes; they suggest that these changes
  may increase mortality and reduce fish population in the Sacramento-San Juaquin
  chinook salmon fishery. </p>
<p>Marine effects obviously are relevant to hatchery-reared fish. Reduced coastal
  productivity resulting from reduced upwelling may reduce the total carrying
  capacity for pink salmon, and it may not be possible to build stocks to historic
  levels in a poor-productivity regime by producing more fry. </p>
<p>In recent years, research has shown that chum salmon productivity follows trends
  that shift in relation to climate-related changes in the ocean. Thus, changes
  in upwelling and the intensity of winds may reduce the carrying capacity for
  chum in the ocean to levels below what might occur during natural changes. </p>
<p>Increases in temperature in freshwater rearing areas and increased winter flows
  may increase freshwater chum mortalities for stocks in the Fraser River and
  other southern rivers. Chum are a very adaptable species, however, and spawning
  tends to be in the lower portion of rivers and streams; thus, the changes in
  saltwater may be more influential than changes in fresh water. It is possible
  that earlier and larger spring flows in rivers may improve survival in the ocean,
  if the initiation of the spring bloom occurs at a more favorable time. In recent
  years, relatively large numbers of age-0 ocean chum salmon have remained in
  the Strait of Georgia until late in the year, even though the surface temperatures
  have increased over the past 20 years. This pattern may indicate that the timing
  of plankton production is more favorable as a result of larger flows in April
  (Beamish et al., 1997). </p>
<p>In the south, warmer river water and reduced flows in late summer may increase
  mortalities and reduce spawning success. Warmer waters in the winter will accelerate
  incubation and hatching and cause alevins to enter lakes earlier. Henderson
  et al. (1992) concluded that warming of sockeye rearing lakes would lower plankton
  production and reduce the size of smolts going to sea. These smaller smolts
  also may encounter reduced food when they enter the ocean, and the resulting
  slower growth may expose juveniles to predation longer and increase mortality
  in the early marine period. Welch et al. (1995) proposed that global warming
  would increase winter temperatures sufficiently that sockeye juveniles would
  migrate out of the northern Pacific into the Bering Sea, effectively reducing
  the winter feeding area. It is known that there are large interannual fluctuations
  in survival (Burgner, 1991) and large, natural, decadal shifts in marine survival
  (Hare and Francis, 1995; Adkison et al., 1996; Beamish et al., 1997). The mechanisms
  involved are not understood, but the shifts in abundance clearly show that changes
  in the ocean environment have profound impacts on the productivity of the stocks.
</p>
<p>It is possible that changes affecting the northern stocks may not have a major
  impact on the stocks in the next 50 years. This speculation is based on the
  cumulative effects of freshwater and marine events in the early 1990s that have
  produced historic high returns to some of the northern sockeye stocks in Canada
  and Alaska. </p>
<p>Projected changes in climate can affect the timing of the return of anadromous
  species to fresh water to spawn in some of the smaller streams. Changes in the
  timing of spawning can change the behavior (e.g., select for later-spawning
  fish); however, it is not anticipated that large numbers of stocks would be
  adversely affected in the next 50 years. Warmer rivers will shorten the incubation
  time, which may result in a longer growing season in fresh water. Although fish
  may feed longer and grow to larger sizes, they also may enter the ocean earlier.
  This shift may change the percentage of life history types that survive more
  than overall survival because there already is an extended period of entry into
  saltwater for the various rearing types. </p>
