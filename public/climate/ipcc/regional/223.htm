<h4>8.3.7.2. Adapting to Sea-Level Rise </h4>
<p><i>Adaptive responses focus on protection of shores or allowing them to retreat,
  with subsequent loss of existing shoreline systems and structures. </i></p>
<p>Several U.S. government agencies have started to prepare for rising sea level.
  The U.S. Coastal Zone Management Act requires state coastal programs to address
  rising sea level, and a few states have modified coastal land-use policies to
  address rising sea level. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is required to consider
  alternative scenarios of future sea-level rise in its feasibility studies. These
  anticipatory measures have been implemented in part because assessments have
  identified measures whose costs are less than the benefits of preparation-even
  when future benefits are discounted by an economic rate of return. </p>
<h4>8.3.7.2.1. Erecting walls to hold back the sea<a name="erectus"></a> </h4>
<p>Most assessments of North American response strategies to future sea-level
  rise have concluded that coastal cities will merit protection with bulkheads,
  dikes, and pumping systems (National Research Council, 1987; Titus et al., 1991).
  Bulkheads, seawalls, and rock revetments already are being used to halt erosion
  to protect land that is well above sea level. Dikes and pumping systems are
  used to protect urban areas such as New Orleans that are below sea level, and
  other areas that are below flood levels. </p>
<p>Although structural measures can protect property from rising water levels,
  the resulting loss of natural shorelines may have adverse environmental, recreational,
  and aesthetic effects. Wetland and shallow-water habitats already are being
  lost because protective structures prevent those systems from migrating inland.
  In other areas, sandy and muddy beaches are being eliminated-impairing the ability
  of some amphibious species to move between the water and the land and directly
  removing the habitat of species that inhabit these beaches. The elimination
  of natural beaches may harm recreational and fishing navigation by removing
  locations from which small craft can be launched or beached in an emergency;
  the loss of beaches also impairs the ability of the public to move along the
  shore for fishing, recreation, and other uses. In the past 15 years, the state
  of Maryland alone has lost the use of 500 km (300 mi) of shorelines through
  the issuance of permits for bulkheads and revetments (Tidal Waters Division,
  1978-93). </p>
<h4>8.3.7.2.2. Elevating land surfaces and beaches<a name="elevating"></a> </h4>
<p>The effects of rising sea level can be offset by elevating beaches, land surfaces,
  and structures as sea level rises. A key benefit of this approach is that the
  character of the shore is not altered. Rapidly subsiding communities such as
  Galveston, Texas, have used fill to raise land elevations; some authors have
  suggested that it will be necessary to elevate Miami because the soils are too
  permeable for effective pumping (e.g., Walker et al., 1989). Regulations along
  San Francisco Bay require projects along the shore or on newly reclaimed land
  to be either protected by a dike or elevated enough to accommodate accelerated
  sea-level rise.<sup><a href="fn8.htm#1">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>The practice of elevating land surfaces is most applicable to recreational
  barrier islands, where environmental and aesthetic factors (such as natural
  beaches and waterfront views) can be as important as property values and shore-protection
  costs (Gibbs, 1984; Howard et al., 1985; Titus, 1990). <a href="#figure8-9">Figure
  8-9</a> illustrates possible responses to sea-level rise for barrier islands:
  building a dike, elevating the land surface, engineering a landward retreat,
  and no protection. A case study of Long Beach Island, New Jersey, concluded
  that any of the three protection options would be less costly than the current
  value of the threatened land (Titus, 1990). Although dikes have a lower direct
  cost than elevating land and structures, the latter approach is least disruptive
  to existing land uses and can be implemented gradually over time. <br>

    <td><b>Figure 8-9</b>: Responses to sea-level rise on developed barrier islands.
      Lightly developed islands may have no practical choice other than the "no
      protection" option, which would result in ocean-side erosion and in some
      cases bayside inundation. Under the "engineered retreat" option, a community
      might tolerate ocean-side erosion but move threatened structures to newly
      created bayside lands, imitating the natural overwash process that occurs
      with narrow undeveloped islands. A more common response is likely to be
      to raise entire islands as well as their beaches; although the sand costs
      are much higher than with an engineered retreat, existing land uses can
      be preserved. Finally, wide urbanized islands may choose to erect seawalls
      and levees (dikes); the loss of beach access and waterfront views, however,
      make this option less feasible for recreational barrier island resorts.</td>
