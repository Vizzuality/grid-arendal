<h4>5.3.2.3. Adaptation Options </h4>
<p>Most studies show that if climate variability remains the same as at present,
  adaptive strategies (change in sowing dates, genotypes, crop rotation) will
  continue to offset expected production losses, as long as such strategies are
  not counteracted by government or other policies in place. The outcome could
  be different if climate conditions become more variable; averaging across years
  then would be less appropriate. </p>
<p>In economic terms, most model studies suggest that on average Europe would
  benefit from climate change because of an overall increase in crop yields, potentially
  leading to lower consumer prices in a free market. Such studies have considered
  adaptation to climate change, in which adjustments at the farm level-including
  shifts in planting dates, changes in water use in irrigated areas, and changes
  in crop cultivars-are considered. Scenarios without such adaptations also have
  been undertaken; the results of the model investigations clearly point to the
  beneficial effects of early adaptation to climatic change. </p>
<p>Other adaptation options include technological advances and socioeconomic options,
  such as land-use planning, watershed management, improved distribution infrastructure,
  information dissemination (including improved climate and weather forecasts),
  adequate trade policy, and national agricultural programs. </p>
<p>The ultimate impacts of climate on the agricultural sector may be determined
  by nonclimate factors that control the system. In Europe, a major concern-and
  the main driving force behind agricultural policy-are laws derived from the
  Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for the countries in the EU. These laws also
  affect other countries in Europe. A common aim in all countries is to reduce
  land degradation and environmental problems. In countries with water limitations,
  the growing competition for water, which leads to water-saving programs, is
  an additional concern. In Spain, for example, one of the main objectives of
  the future law on water use (Ley del Plan Hidrologico Nacional, MOPT, 1993)
  is to increase water-use efficiency to increase water availability; the specific
  water savings are reflected mainly in improvement of the irrigation systems
  and an efficient adjustment between crop water demand and supply. </p>
<p>Little concern has been devoted to the large percentage of the population working
  in agriculture in southern Europe. The consequences of climatic variations in
  agronomic systems that are highly regulated, such as the systems in the countries
  of the EU, are difficult to predict because crops are highly subsidized and
  therefore crop prices are artificially high. For example, although agricultural
  production in Spain decreased in 1994 (-4.3%) as a result of the drought conditions,
  the Spanish agrarian rent increased (+14%, the largest increase in the EU) (MAPA,
  1995) because of the increase in Spanish commodity prices and direct subsidies
  to Spanish farmers. From the Spanish perspective, it is clear that agricultural
  regulations and the devaluation of the national currency (peseta) had an initial
  positive effect on agricultural prices and on farmers' subsidies (Matea, 1995).
</p>
<p>Fisheries adaptation options could provide large benefits irrespective of climate
  change: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Design and implement national and international fishery management institutions
    that recognize shifting species ranges, accessibility, and abundances and
    balance species conservation with local needs for economic efficiency and
    stability.</li>
  <li>Support innovation through research on management systems and aquatic ecosystems.</li>
  <li>Expand aquaculture to increase and stabilize seafood supplies, help stabilize
    employment, and conserve wild stocks.</li>
  <li>In coastal areas, integrate the management of fisheries with other uses
    of coastal zones.</li>
  <li>Monitor health problems (e.g., red tides, ciguatera, cholera) that could
    increase under climate change and harm fish stocks and consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Genetic engineering has the potential to increase the production and efficiency
  of fish farming (Fischetti, 1991). However, resource managers are very concerned
  about accidental or intentional release of altered and introduced species that
  might harm natural stocks and gene pools. Around Fennoscandia, escapees and
  nonindigenous reproduction may have reached or exceeded the recruitment of salmon
  wild stocks (Ackefors et al., 1991). Introduction of pathogenic organisms and
  antibiotic-resistant pathogens also is of concern; this problem needs to be
  addressed in any long-term planning. </p>
