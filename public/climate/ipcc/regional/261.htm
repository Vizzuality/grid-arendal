<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Temperate Asia is composed of three regions: monsoon Asia, excluding its tropical
  subregion; the inner arid/semi-arid regions; and Siberia. The region includes
  countries in Asia between 18°N and the Arctic Circle, including the Japanese
  islands, the Korean peninsula, Mongolia, most parts of China, and Siberia in
  Russia. The east-west distance of the area is about 8,000 km, and its north-south
  extent is about 5,000 km. The largest plateau in the world-the Qing-Zang plateau
  (Tibetan plateau), with an average elevation of more than 4,000 m-is located
  in southWest China. Inner Siberia, with a mean monthly temperature in January
  of about -50°C, is the coldest part of the northern hemisphere in winter; this
  area is called the "cold pole." On the other hand, extremely dry, hot climate
  prevails in the Taklamakan Desert in China. </p>
<p>Human activities through the ages have brought profound changes to the landscape
  of this area. Except for boreal forests in Siberia, other natural forests in
  the region have long been destroyed. Broad plains have been cultivated and irrigated
  for thousands of years, and natural grasslands have been used for animal husbandry.
  In recent years, many countries in this region have shown marked economic development.
  Their gross national products (GNPs) and populations are increasing at an extremely
  rapid rate. The region's population is expected to grow from 1.42 billion in
  1995 to 1.72 billion by 2025; the environment in this region already is under
  great stress. The impacts of expected climate change may exacerbate existing
  environmental problems. </p>
<p><b>Climate Characteristics</b></p>
<p>Climate differs widely within Temperate Asia. It has a tropical monsoon climate
  in the far south; a humid, cool, temperate climate in the north; and a desert
  climate or steppe climate in the west and northWest. In the rest of the area-where
  most of the population of the region is concentrated-a humid, temperate climate
  prevails. </p>
<p>The east Asian monsoon has great influence on temporal and spatial variations
  in the hydrological cycle over parts of the region. For example, the summer
  monsoon accounts for 70% of the total annual runoff in China; for northern China,
  this precipitation often concentrates in a few storms during the flood season.
  At time scales longer than 100 years, the summer monsoons generally are stronger
  during (globally) warmer periods, leading to wetter conditions in northern China.
  On the other hand, drier conditions prevail over most of the monsoon-affected
  area during (globally) colder periods. </p>
<p>Tropical cyclones (typhoons) frequent the coastal regions. They are important
  not only because they cause disasters along the coasts but also because they
  are beneficial carriers of water resources to inland areas. The frequency, path,
  and intensity of typhoons vary greatly from year to year, with clear differences
  between El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and non-ENSO years. </p>
<p>Over the past century, the average annual temperature in Temperate Asia has
  increased by more than 1°C. This increase has been most evident since the 1970s;
  seasonally, the warming is evident mainly in winter. Subregionally, over the
  past 100 years, there has been a 2-4°C temperature increase in eastern and northeastern
  Temperate Asia and a 1-2°C temperature decrease in some parts of southeasten
  China, except for the coastal area. These trends also are reflected in corresponding
  seasonal temperature distributions, except that summer temperatures in central
  Siberia actually are decreasing. In terms of precipitation, large decadal variability
  seems to have masked a smaller positive trend in annual precipitation. Over
  the past 100 years, there has been a 20-50% increase in east Siberia; a 10-20%
  increase across the Korean peninsula, northeast China, the Huaihe River Basin,
  and the Yellow River Basin; and a 10-20% decrease in Japan and the southern
  half of east China, including Taiwan. The increasing trend in annual precipitation
  in northeast China is evident mainly in spring and summer rainfall; in south
  China, annual winter precipitation shows a slight positive trend, in contrast
  to a negative trend in total annual precipitation. </p>
<p><b>Future Climate Projection</b> </p>
<p>Numerical experiments with coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models
  (AOGCMs) that include transient increases in greenhouse gases [i.e., increases
  in equivalent carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) at a rate of 1% per year] project a warming
  of between 2°C and 3°C over the annual mean of the region at the time of CO<sub>2</sub>
  doubling. Warming was more pronounced in the arid/semi-arid and Siberian regions
  than in the coastal monsoon region. Recent simulations, wherein GCMs also include
  the offsetting effects of sulfate aerosols, project a temperature rise of about
  0.8°C over the eastern part of the region, about 1°C over most parts of eastern
  China, and close to 2°C in the Siberian region on an annual mean basis by the
  middle of the next century. It should be noted that the projections that account
  for sulfate aerosols also are highly uncertain. </p>
<p>In equilibrium and transient-response numerical experiments with GCMs, precipitation
  is projected to marginally increase (<0.5 mm/day) at the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling
  during the winter (DJF) throughout the region. In the summer (JJA), the spatial
  pattern of projected changes in precipitation is not uniform over the region.
  Model projections suggest that precipitation will increase slightly (0.5-1.0
  mm/day) in the northern part of the region (Siberia), and by more than 1 mm/day
  over the Korean peninsula, the Japanese islands, and the southWestern part of
  China. In contrast, precipitation may decline in the northern, western, and
  southern parts of China. The projected decline in rainfall over most of China
  is substantial in numerical experiments that include the effects of sulfate
  aerosols. </p>
<p><b>Summary Points</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>For boreal forests, which are concentrated mainly in the Russian Federation,
    models suggest large shifts in distribution (e.g., area reductions of up to
    50%) and productivity. In the boreal region, grasslands and shrublands may
    expand significantly, whereas the tundra zone may decrease by up to 50%, according
    to model predictions. Climatic warming would increase the release of methane
    from deep peat deposits-particularly from tundra soils, since they would become
    wetter. The release of CO<sub>2</sub> is expected to increase, though not by more than
    25% of its present level.</li>
  <li>It is likely that by 2050, up to a quarter of the existing mountain glacier
    mass would disappear. For areas with very large glaciers, the extra runoff
    may persist for a century or more. By 2050, the volume of runoff from glaciers
    in central Asia is projected to increase threefold. Eventually, however, glacial
    runoff will taper off or even cease. Projected future glacier runoff is about
    68 km<sup>3</sup>/yr in 2100, compared with the present value of 98 km<sup>3</sup>/yr. Permafrost
    in northeast China is expected to disappear if the temperature were to increase
    by 2°C or more. Over the Qing-Zang plateau, estimates of the impact of climate
    change on permafrost range from its complete disappearance as a result of
    a temperature increase of 2°C to a raising of its elevation limit to 4,600
    m as a result of a warming of 3°C.</li>
  <li>Hydrologically, model results suggest that the areas most vulnerable to
    climate change would be in the northern part of China. Projected changes in
    runoff are due mainly to changes in precipitation in spring, summer, and autumn
    because of the strong influence of the monsoon climate. The most critical
    uncertainty is the lack of credible projections of the effect of climate change
    on either the Asian monsoon or the ENSO phenomenon, both of which strongly
    influence river runoff. In moderately and extremely dry years, the projected
    potential water deficiency caused by climate change-although less than that
    caused by population growth and economic development-may exacerbate seriously
    the existing water shortage. </li>
  <li>Different GCMs' estimated impacts on agricultural yields vary widely in
    range. Possible large negative impacts on rice production as a consequence
    of climate change would be of concern in the face of expected population increases.
    In China, across different scenarios and different sites, yield changes for
    several crops by 2050 are projected to be -78% to +15% for rice, -21% to +55%
    for wheat, and -19% to +5% for maize. An increase in productivity may occur
    if the positive effects of CO<sub>2</sub> on crop growth are considered, but the magnitude
    of the fertilization effect remains uncertain.</li>
