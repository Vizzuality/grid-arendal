<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Consistent with trends from individual plants, many natural ecosystems (including
  grasslands) show little or no increase in standing crop or production at elevated
  CO<sub>2</sub> when temperatures are low or nutrients are limiting (Oechel et al., 1993;
  Fredeen et al., 1995; Schäppi and Körner, 1996). In the Arctic tundra there
  is little expected change in plant growth from increased CO<sub>2</sub>, although there
  is an expected decrease in insect-pollinated forbs (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter
  2). However, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> has been shown to increase aboveground net primary
  productivity in tallgrass prairies, shortgrass steppe, and coastal salt marshes
  (Curtis et al., 1989; Owensby et al., 1993; Hunt et al., 1996) and root biomass
  in grasslands (Owensby et al., 1993; Jongen et al., 1995; Newton et al., 1995)
  when essential elements like nitrogen are plentiful or water begins to limit
  growth and the positive effects of CO<sub>2</sub> on water relations are expressed. </p>
<p>Changes in species composition emerge as a major unknown with the potential
  to affect ecosystem processes (productivity, forage quality, and nitrogen cycling)
  in ways that are not evident from studies that consider the direct effects of
  elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration alone. Given that the geographic distribution of
  rangeland vegetation and aboveground net primary productivity are highly correlated
  with precipitation, temperature, nutrient status, and soil-water availability
  on rangelands (Sala et al., 1988; Stephenson, 1990; Bailey, 1996; IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Chapter 2; Myneni et al., 1997; Polley et al., 1997), interactions among
  global warming, changes in precipitation, grazing, fire, rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentration,
  and species competition must be more clearly understood before we will be able
  to predict with confidence changes in forage quantity for North American rangelands.
</p>
<p>On improved pastures, the alteration of species composition through reseeding
  with adapted grass species or the introduction of legumes to grass-dominated
  pastures is the most likely method to reduce the impacts of climate change.
  This approach would have the additional benefit of improving forage value for
  livestock while possibly reducing the average methane emission per head of livestock
  because of improved forage quality (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 2). For native
  rangelands, active interventions to reduce impacts from increases in temperature
  or CO<sub>2</sub> or changes in precipitation frequency and amount are limited because
  of the large areal extent of rangelands and the low economic return per acre
  of land. Introduction of nonnative adapted species may be able to compensate
  for the loss of some forage production and watershed protection if native species
  decrease. However, the application and extent of this technology on federal
  lands may be limited by existing rules, regulation, and pending and future court
  cases. </p>
<p><i>Climate-induced variability and extreme events will increase the complexity
  of managing rangelands.</i> </p>
<p>Rangeland vegetation is found where precipitation, temperature, and soil development
  provide suitable habitat for grasses, forbs, shrubs, and open stands of trees.
  Generally, these lands are characterized by extremes in temperature or in the
  timing, intensity, and amount of precipitation the site receives; these extremes
  drive rangeland ecosystems (Griffin and Friedel, 1985; Westoby et al., 1989).
  Precipitation is the major determinant of the structure, function, and sustainability
  of natural ecosystems (Branson et al., 1981). Current human activity on rangelands
  significantly alters plant species abundance and distribution and the hydrological
  cycle, accelerates erosion rates, and can overwhelm any change in regional or
  global climate (Thurow et al., 1986; Weltz and Wood, 1986; IPCC 1996, WG II,
  Chapter 2; Williams and Balling, 1996). Small changes in the frequency or extent
  of extreme events may have a disproportionate effect on what management must
  cope with to sustain rangeland ecosystems (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 2). Short-term
  variations in local or regional precipitation-upon which management planning
  often is based-are greater than the predicted change in the mean value of precipitation
  for North America (Shuttleworth, 1996). With the addition of climate change
  to existing stresses on rangelands, they may become more sensitive to extreme
  events such as drought, 100-year floods, and insect outbreaks that could reduce
  their long-term sustainability and escalate the desertification process in arid
  and semi-arid lands in North America (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapters 2 and 4). </p>
<p>The most promising adaptive approach is to provide incentives to use management
  techniques that reduce the risk of these lands becoming degraded during extreme
  climatic events (i.e., droughts). The most cost-effective strategy is to improve
  lands already under stress and to strengthen their resistance to future extreme
  events. This approach could include changes in livestock type and number, changes
  in season of use, complete rest, or the development of additional infrastructure
  (new watering locations, fencing, etc.) to achieve proper stocking density.
</p>
<p>A second promising avenue of adaptation is to provide arid and semi-arid land
  managers with more accurate predictions of regional precipitation on a seasonal
  to interannual basis. This information is particularly important prior to droughts
  or extremely wet years. Provision of these types of predictions is becoming
  more likely because recent research indicates that improvements in coupled ocean-atmosphere
  models make it possible to predict climatic conditions related to the El Niño-Southern
  Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon more than a year before the event (Chen et al.,
  1995). Predicted precipitation patterns can be used as inputs to ecological
  and hydrological models and thereby could provide the capability to assess the
  impacts of changing rainfall on flood frequency, surface hydrology, soil erosion,
  and forage and crop production and allow managers to develop mitigation plans
  to reduce degradation to rangeland ecosystems by altering grazing systems and
  purchasing supplemental feed before the onset of droughts. </p>
<p><i>Arid lands may increase.</i> </p>
<p>Lane et al. (1994) reported that trend analyses for the period 1901-87 suggest
  that mean annual temperatures increased globally at the rate of 0.5°C per century,
  in the United States at 0.3°C per century, and in the southWestern desert region
  at about 1.2°C per century. Early climate change predictions suggested that
  a temperature increase of up to 17% in desert lands could occur in North America
  (Emanuel et al., 1985). VEMAP Members (1995) considered climate change and doubled
  CO<sub>2</sub> from computer simulations of three different biogeographic models (see <a href="315.htm">Annex C</a>) and three different climate scenarios; a general result was that grasslands
  would contract and move eastward into the broadleaf forest and that shrublands
  would decrease within the United States. Potentially large increases (185%)
  in subtropical arid shrublands could occur in the southWest region of North
  America. Depending on the model and climate scenario, however, there could be
  a potential decrease (-56%) in subtropical arid shrublands (VEMAP Members, 1995).
  The most recent projections from the MAPSS model (<a href="315.htm">Annex C</a>)
  indicate up to a 200% increase in leaf area index in the desert southWest region
  of North America and a northern migration and expansion of arid-land species
  into the Great Basin region of North America. Various combinations of vegetation
  redistribution and altered biogeochemical cycles could result in novel plant
  communities and increases in arid regions. </p>
<p>Desertification is a function of human activities and adverse climate conditions.
  Recovery of desert soils from disturbance and desertification is a slow process.
  More than 50 years may be required to reestablish the nitrogen fixation capability
  of the soil, and 200 years may be required to completely reestablish the vegetation
  community in the arid southern region of North America (Belnap, 1995). During
  the recovery period, the site is at increased risk of wind and water erosion
  (Belnap, 1995; IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 4). Although long-term measures may
  need to be developed to cope with climate change, research that deals with annual
  and interannual fluctuations in precipitation must continue to receive attention
  because precipitation fluctuations directly affect North American strategic
  food and fiber supplies (grain production and forage for wildlife and livestock)
  (Oram, 1989). </p>
<p><i>Landslides in mountain areas could be more frequent.</i> </p>
<p>Catastrophic geomorphic processes in mountain terrain are heavily influenced
  by climate (e.g., precipitation). As a result, the occurrence of these processes-which
  include landslides and outburst floods-is sensitive to climate change. The frequency
  of debris flows and other landslide types can be expected to increase under
  conditions of increased precipitation, debuttressing of mountain slopes due
  to glacier ice losses, and the decay of mountain permafrost during recent and
  projected warming. As in the past, these events should be expected to impact
  on settlements, infrastructural elements, resources, and the environment, resulting
  in human and financial losses. Water quality would be affected by increased
  sediment loads. Fish and wildlife habitat, as well as roads and other structures,
  could be at increased risk. The nature of the landslide response is complicated
  by factors such as forest harvesting and other land-use changes (Eybergen and
  Imeson, 1989; IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 5; Evans and Clague, 1997). </p>
