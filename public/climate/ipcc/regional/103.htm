<h4>5.3.1.4. Freshwater Ecosystems </h4>
<p>Many of the ecological impacts on freshwater systems depend on hydrological
  responses to climatic change, which are relatively uncertain given the current
  status of GCMs. The problem is one of scale: Many of the most significant impacts
  on freshwater ecosytems will result from hydrological changes at the scales
  of small catchments and drainage basins (which are unresolved by GCMs) and changes
  in hydrological variability rather than mean conditions, which is poorly taken
  into account by climate models. </p>
<p>Although the biodiversity of freshwater species may increase in a warmer climate-particularly
  in middle and high latitudes-there may be an initial reduction in species diversity
  in cool temperate and boreal regions (essentially Fennoscandia and northern
  Russia) if the northward migration of warm-water species cannot keep pace with
  the rate of loss of cool-water species because of physiological limitations,
  lack of north-south migration corridors, and limitations to genetic adaptation.
</p>
<p>It is likely that the impacts of climate change will be more pronounced in
  the littoral zones of lakes than in the pelagic zones. Because aquatic macrophytes
  have access to the nutrients contained in sediments, they will be able to exploit
  higher temperatures; emergent vegetation is likely to benefit from higher CO<sub>2</sub>
  concentrations (Kankaala et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Water levels in lakes and reservoirs are highly sensitive to weather conditions;
  in some regions of Europe, small lakes and reservoirs may fluctuate rapidly
  in response to changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration. Where water
  levels are likely to decline, inshore areas will change significantly. In shallow
  lakes and reservoirs in particular, inshore aquatic vegetation and surrounding
  wetlands would decrease in area. This decrease may result in changed habitats
  for aquatic biota, reduction of productivity, and even extinction of fish and
  invertebrate species that are dependent on these types of biomes. Where lakes
  have extensive bordering wetlands, declining water levels would reduce productivity
  and impact negatively on populations of fish and invertebrates that are dependent
  on these types of wetlands for their survival. Even if lake levels remain constant,
  decreasing throughflow may change the water quality of lakes. </p>
<p>Decreasing lake volumes and areas also would result in increased loading of
  nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and others) from catchments per unit lake area
  or volume. Correspondingly, increased eutrophication can be expected-with high
  production of aquatic biomass, decreasing species diversity, deterioration of
  oxygen conditions, and adverse effects on water quality. In regions where most
  drinking water comes from surface sources, decreasing lake volumes and lower
  water quality may cause serious problems for human use. </p>
<p>In areas where increased snowfall and rainfall is expected, loading by acidifying
  pollutants from the atmosphere may increase. This effect would be critical for
  lakes located on bedrock with low neutralizing capacity (as in parts of the
  Alps, the Pyrenees, the Carpathians, and Fennoscandia). With further acidification
  of lakes, reductions in species and trophic-level diversity might occur. In
  the past decade, however, emission reduction measures in Europe have resulted
  in a decrease in atmospheric sulfur deposition of up to 50%; nitrogen deposition
  levels have remained unchanged. As a result, sulfate concentrations in freshwaters
  are decreasing at most European sites, and alkalinity values are increasing
  (particularly in the 1990s). Nitrate concentrations increased in European freshwaters
  during the 1980s but have remained stable or decreased in the 1990s. It has
  been postulated that the changes in the 1990s may reflect a climatic influence
  rather than changes in nitrogen deposition rates (UNECE, 1997). </p>
<p>In many parts of Europe, hydrological systems are heavily impacted by human
  activities (e.g., water use, sewage effluents, channel modification, removal
  of vegetation that acts as refugia for numerous plant and animal species, drainage,
  land-use changes, fertilization in catchment areas, soil erosion following deforestation).
  Such direct human interference, along with other environmental stress factors
  such as air pollution, is likely to exacerbate the impacts of climate change,
  with a consequent reduction of biodiversity in most parts of the continent.
