<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Several climate regimes characterize the African continent; the wet tropical,
  dry tropical, and alternating wet and dry climates are the most common. Many
  countries on the continent are prone to recurrent droughts; some drought episodes,
  particularly in southeast Africa, are associated with El Niño-Southern Oscillation
  (ENSO) phenomena. Deterioration in terms of trade, inappropriate policies, high
  population growth rates, and lack of significant investment-coupled with a highly
  variable climate-have made it difficult for several countries to develop patterns
  of livelihood that would reduce pressure on the natural resource base. Under
  the assumption that access to adequate financing is not provided, Africa is
  the continent most vulnerable to the impacts of projected changes because widespread
  poverty limits adaptation capabilities. </p>
<p><i>Ecosystems</i>: In Africa today, tropical forests and rangelands are under
  threat from population pressures and systems of land use. Generally apparent
  effects of these threats include loss of biodiversity, rapid deterioration in
  land cover, and depletion of water availability through destruction of catchments
  and aquifers. Changes in climate will interact with these underlying changes
  in the environment, adding further stresses to a deteriorating situation. A
  sustained increase in mean ambient temperatures beyond 1°C would cause significant
  changes in forest and rangeland cover; species distribution, composition, and
  migration patterns; and biome distribution. Many organisms in the deserts already
  are near their tolerance limits, and some may not be able to adapt further under
  hotter conditions. Arid to semi-arid subregions and the grassland areas of eastern
  and southern Africa, as well as areas currently under threat from land degradation
  and desertification, are particularly vulnerable. Were rainfall to increase
  as projected by some general circulation models (GCMs) in the highlands of east
  Africa and equatorial central Africa, marginal lands would become more productive
  than they are now. These effects are likely to be negated, however, by population
  pressure on marginal forests and rangelands. Adaptive options include control
  of deforestation, improved rangeland management, expansion of protected areas,
  and sustainable management of forests. </p>
<p><i>Hydrology and Water Resources</i>: Of the 19 countries around the world
  currently classified as water-stressed, more are in Africa than in any other
  region-and this number is likely to increase, independent of climate change,
  as a result of increases in demand resulting from population growth, degradation
  of watersheds caused by land-use change, and siltation of river basins. A reduction
  in precipitation projected by some GCMs for the Sahel and southern Africa-if
  accompanied by high interannual variability-could be detrimental to the hydrological
  balance of the continent and disrupt various water-dependent socioeconomic activities.
  Variable climatic conditions may render the management of water resources more
  difficult both within and between countries. A drop in water level in dams and
  rivers could adversely affect the quality of water by increasing the concentrations
  of sewage waste and industrial effluents, thereby increasing the potential for
  the outbreak of diseases and reducing the quality and quantity of fresh water
  available for domestic use. Adaptation options include water harvesting, management
  of water outflow from dams, and more efficient water usage. </p>
<p><i>Agriculture and Food Security</i>: Except in the oil-exporting countries,
  agriculture is the economic mainstay in most African countries, contributing
  20-30% of gross domestic product (GDP) in sub-Saharan Africa and 55% of the
  total value of African exports. In most African countries, farming depends entirely
  on the quality of the rainy season-a situation that makes Africa particularly
  vulnerable to climate change. Increased droughts could seriously impact the
  availability of food, as in the Horn of Africa and southern Africa during the
  1980s and 1990s. A rise in mean winter temperatures also would be detrimental
  to the production of winter wheat and fruits that need the winter chill. However,
  in subtropical Africa, warmer winters would reduce the incidence of damaging
  frosts, making it possible to grow horticultural produce susceptible to frosts
  at higher elevations than is possible at present. Productivity of freshwater
  fisheries may increase, although the mix of fish species could be altered. Changes
  in ocean dynamics could lead to changes in the migratory patterns of fish and
  possibly to reduced fish landings, especially in coastal artisinal fisheries.
</p>
<p><i>Coastal Systems</i>: Several African coastal zones-many of which already
  are under stress from population pressure and conflicting uses-would be adversely
  affected by sea-level rise associated with climate change. The coastal nations
  of west and central Africa (e.g., Senegal, The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria,
  Cameroon, Gabon, Angola) have low-lying lagoonal coasts that are susceptible
  to erosion and hence are threatened by sea-level rise, particularly because
  most of the countries in this area have major and rapidly expanding cities on
  the coast. The west coast often is buffeted by storm surges and currently is
  at risk from erosion, inundation, and extreme storm events. The coastal zone
  of east Africa also will be affected, although this area experiences calm conditions
  through much of the year. However, sea-level rise and climatic variation may
  reduce the buffer effect of coral and patch reefs along the east coast, increasing
  the potential for erosion. A number of studies indicate that a sizable proportion
  of the northern part of the Nile delta will be lost through a combination of
  inundation and erosion, with consequent loss of agricultural land and urban
  areas. Adaptation measures in African coastal zones are available but would
  be very costly, as a percentage of GDP, for many countries. These measures could
  include erection of sea walls and relocation of vulnerable human settlements
  and other socioeconomic facilities. </p>
<p><i>Human Settlement, Industry, and Transportation</i>: The main challenges
  likely to face African populations will emanate from extreme climate events
  such as floods (and resulting landslides in some areas), strong winds, droughts,
  and tidal waves. Individuals living in marginal areas may be forced to migrate
  to urban areas (where infrastructure already is approaching its limits as a
  result of population pressure) if the marginal lands become less productive
  under new climate conditions. Climate change could worsen current trends in
  depletion of biomass energy resources. Reduced stream flows would cause reductions
  in hydropower production, leading to negative effects on industrial productivity
  and costly relocation of some industrial plants. Management of pollution, sanitation,
  waste disposal, water supply, and public health, as well as provision of adequate
  infrastructure in urban areas, could become more difficult and costly under
  changed climate conditions. </p>
<p><i>Human Health</i>: Africa is expected to be at risk primarily from increased
  incidences of vector-borne diseases and reduced nutritional status. A warmer
  environment could open up new areas for malaria; altered temperature and rainfall
  patterns also could increase the incidence of yellow fever, dengue fever, onchocerciasis,
  and trypanosomiasis. Increased morbidity and mortality in subregions where vector-borne
  diseases increase following climatic changes would have far-reaching economic
  consequences. In view of the poor economic status of most African nations, global
  efforts will be necessary to tackle the potential health effects. </p>
<p><i>Tourism and Wildlife</i>: Tourism-one of Africa's fastest-growing industries-is
  based on wildlife, nature reserves, coastal resorts, and an abundant water supply
  for recreation. Projected droughts and/or reduction in precipitation in the
  Sahel and eastern and southern Africa would devastate wildlife and reduce the
  attractiveness of some nature reserves, thereby reducing income from current
  vast investments in tourism. </p>
<p><i>Conclusions</i>: The African continent is particularly vulnerable to the
  impacts of climate change because of factors such as widespread poverty, recurrent
  droughts, inequitable land distribution, and overdependence on rain-fed agriculture.
  Although adaptation options, including traditional coping strategies, theoretically
  are available, in practice the human, infrastructural, and economic response
  capacity to effect timely response actions may well be beyond the economic means
  of some countries. </p>
