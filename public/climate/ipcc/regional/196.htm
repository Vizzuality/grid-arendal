<p>Thus, two contrasting scenarios of the North American forest future must be
  considered: one with considerable forest dieback, another with much enhanced
  forest growth. These contrasting scenarios represent endpoints on a spectrum
  of possible responses. In general, however, the enhanced-growth scenarios occur
  under the least amount of simulated global warming, whereas the severe decline
  or dieback scenarios occur under the greatest projected global warming. With
  the incorporation of direct CO<sub>2</sub> effects, small temperature increases can produce
  increased growth, but larger temperature increases still produce declines. Without
  a direct CO<sub>2</sub> effect, forest decline simulations are far more widespread, even
  under the least warming scenarios. These results suggest the possibility that
  early forest responses to global warming could exhibit enhanced growth; later
  stages could produce widespread decline or dieback. Most combinations of scenarios
  and CO<sub>2</sub> effects produce intermediate scenarios, with a regional mosaic of forest
  dieback and enhanced forest growth. When coupled with economic models, these
  internally consistent but potentially opposite regional responses provide the
  basis for regional, national, and globally integrated assessments. Also, it
  is not clear that greenhouse gases will stabilize at the equivalent of 2xCO<sub>2</sub>
  forcing; they could increase to 3xCO<sub>2</sub> or 4xCO<sub>2</sub> (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 2.1.3).
</p>
<p><i>Forests cannot move across the land surface as rapidly as the climate can.
  The faster the rate of climate change, the greater the probability of ecosystem
  disruption and species extinction. </i></p>
<p>Were temperature-induced drought dieback to occur, it likely would begin shortly
  after observable warming; if accompanied by short-term precipitation deficits,
  it could occur very rapidly (Solomon, 1986; King and Neilson, 1992; Martin,
  1992; Smith and Shugart, 1993; Vose et al., 1993; Elliot and Swank, 1994; Auclair
  et al., 1996; Martin, 1996). That is, dieback could begin within a few decades
  from the present and might include potential increases in secondary impacts
  from pests and fire. Alternatively, forest growth might increase in the early
  stages of global warming, only to revert to widespread and rapid drought-induced
  forest dieback after higher temperatures have significantly increased evaporative
  demand. Vegetation change in areas of enhanced growth, especially previously
  unforested areas, would be more gradual (decades to hundreds of years), constrained
  by dispersal, establishment, and competition. </p>
<p>Under global warming the physical and biotic components of most animal habitats
  will likely change at different rates (Davis, 1986; Dobson et al., 1989; Malcolm
  and Markham, 1996; Markham, 1996). The faster the rate of change, the greater
  the disequilibrium between physical and biotic habitat components and the higher
  the probability of substantial ecosystem disruption and species extinctions
  (Malcolm and Markham, 1996; Markham, 1996). However, species will respond differently
  than biomes (Neilson, 1993a,b; Lenihan and Neilson, 1995). The relative mixtures
  of species in forest communities will change-and under either forest expansion
  or contraction, some important species could be at risk. </p>
<p><i>Forest ecosystems are expected to shift northward and upward in altitude,
  but expansion may be limited by dispersal and poor soils.</i> </p>
<p>All three major forest types within North America expand north and forested
  areas, with a few exceptions, increase under all scenarios with or without a
  direct CO<sub>2</sub> effect (biogeography models of potential natural forests under equilibrium
  conditions). Total forest area increases by as much as 25-32% as projected under
  the FAR 2xCO<sub>2</sub> GCM scenarios (including a direct, physiological CO<sub>2</sub> effect)-much
  less than the 42-44% under the SAR scenarios with a direct physiological CO<sub>2</sub>
  effect. However, the projected forest-area increases under the SAR scenarios
  are reduced to 21-24% when a direct physiological CO<sub>2</sub> effect is not included.
  In the long term, more carbon would be sequestered by forests under these scenarios.
  Before equilibrium conditions are reached, however, the processes of forest
  redistribution could cause a temporary reduction in forest area and a carbon
  pulse to the atmosphere. </p>
<p>Boreal forests displace most of the taiga/tundra region and increase in area
  under the SAR scenarios but are projected to increase or decrease under the
  FAR scenarios (<a href="194.htm#table8-2">Table 8-2</a>). It has been projected
  that the temperate evergreen forests shift northward into Canada and Alaska
  and expand under the climate projected by the FAR scenarios (<a href="315.htm">Annex C</a>, <a href="320.htm#figureC-2">Figures C-2</a> to <a href="320.htm#figureC-5">C-5</a>; <a href="194.htm#table8-2">Table
  8-2</a>). Temperate evergreen forests may expand or contract in area-due in
  part to conversion from conifers to broadleaf deciduous forests and in part
  to severe forest dieback under some scenarios (<a href="315.htm">Annex C</a>,
  <a href="320.htm#figureC-2">Figures C-2</a> to <a href="320.htm#figureC-5">C-5</a>; <a href="194.htm#table8-2">Table
  8-2</a>; VEMAP Members, 1995). The temperate mixed forest is projected to invade
  the boreal forest to the north and experience gains in area under all simulations.
  Smaller gains in area of both temperate forest types occur under more xeric
  scenarios; forest expansions to the north are balanced by forest dieback in
  the southern zones. Because dieback in the southern zones might occur more rapidly
  than northward advances, there could be a short-term reduction in the area of
  important temperate and boreal forests (King and Neilson, 1992; Smith and Shugart,
  1993). </p>
