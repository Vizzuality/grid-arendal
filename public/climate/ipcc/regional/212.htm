<h4>8.3.6. Food and Fiber: Fisheries and Aquatic Systems </h4>
<p>Although there is considerable uncertainty about the physical changes and response
  of the various freshwater and marine species, it is possible to suggest how
  certain species may respond to projected climate changes over the next 50-100
  years. The uncertainties highlight the importance of research to separate the
  impacts of changing climate from natural population fluctuations and fishing
  effects. Many commercial finfish populations already are under pressure (e.g.,
  overexploited), and global change may be of minor concern compared with the
  impacts of ongoing and future commercial fishing and human use or impacts on
  the coastal zone. Further, changes in the variability of climate may have more
  serious consequences on the abundance and distribution of fisheries than changes
  in mean conditions alone (Katz and Brown, 1992), and changes in future climate
  variability are poorly understood at this time. </p>
<p>Fish, including shellfish, respond directly to climate fluctuations, as well
  as to changes in their biological environment (predators, prey, species interactions,
  disease) and fishing pressures. Although this multiforcing sometimes makes it
  difficult to establish unequivocal linkages between changes in the physical
  environment and the responses of fish or shellfish stocks, some effects are
  clear (see reviews by Cushing and Dickson, 1976; Bakun et al., 1982; Cushing,
  1982; Sheppard et al., 1984; Sissenwine, 1984; and Sharp, 1987). These effects
  include changes in the growth and reproduction of individual fish, as well as
  the distribution and abundance of fish populations. In terms of abundance, the
  influence occurs principally through effects on recruitment (how many young
  survive long enough to potentially enter the fishery) but in some cases may
  be related to direct mortality of adult fish. </p>
<p>Fish carrying capacity in aquatic ecosystems is a function of the biology of
  a particular species and its interrelationship with its environment and associated
  species. Specific factors that regulate the carrying capacity are poorly known
  for virtually all species, but some general statements can be made with some
  confidence. Fish are affected by their environment through four main processes
  (Sheppard et al., 1984): </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Direct physiological effects, including metabolic processes influenced
    by temperature, salinity, and oxygen levels</i>-Fish often seek optimal temperature
    or salinity regimes or avoid suboptimal conditions. Thus, ocean and freshwater
    changes as a result of projected climate changes can lead to distributional
    changes. In suboptimal conditions, performance is reduced, leading to starvation
    or increased predation.</li>
  <li><i>Diseases</i>-Certain environmental conditions are more conducive to diseases
    than others (e.g., warm waters can trigger disease outbreaks; likewise, cold
    temperatures can limit them).</li>
  <li><i>Food</i>-The environment affects feeding rates and competition, as well
    as abundance, quality, size, timing, spatial distribution, and concentration
    of food. </li>
  <li><i>Predators</i>-The environment affects predation through influences on
    the abundance and distribution of predators. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fish are influenced not only by temperature and salinity conditions but also
  by mixing and transport processes (e.g., mixing can affect primary production
  by promoting nutrient replenishment of the surface layers; it also can influence
  the encounter rate between larvae and prey organisms). Ichthyoplankton (fish
  eggs and larvae) can be dispersed by the currents, which may carry them into
  or away from areas of good food production, or into or out of optimal temperature
  or salinity conditions-and perhaps, ultimately determine whether they are lost
  to the original population. </p>
<p>Climate is only one of several factors that regulate fish abundance. Managers
  attempt to model abundance trends in relation to fishing effects in order to
  sustain fisheries. In theory, a successful model could account for global warming
  impacts along with other impacts without understanding them. For many species
  of fish, the natural mortality rate is an inverse function of age: Longer-lived
  fish will be affected by natural changes differently than shorter-lived fish.
  If the atmosphere-freshwater-ocean regime is stable for a particular time, it
  is possible to estimate the age-specific mortality rates for a species of interest.
  However, at least some parts of the atmosphere-freshwater-ocean system are prone
  to oscillations on a decadal scale, which may not be cyclical. These natural
  changes occur globally; thus, they will have impacts on the freshwater and marine
  ecosystems that support North American fish populations. Under natural conditions,
  it may be expected that the different life histories of these fish will result
  in different times of adjustment to a new set of environmental conditions. </p>
<p>Any effects of climate change on fisheries are expected to be most pronounced
  in sectors that already are characterized by full utilization, large overcapacities
  of harvesting and processing, and sharp conflicts among users and competing
  uses of aquatic ecosystems. Climate change impacts, including changes in natural
  climate variability on seasonal to interannual time scales, are likely to exacerbate
  existing stresses on fish stocks. The effectiveness of actions to reduce the
  decline of fisheries depends on our ability to distinguish among these stresses
  and other causes of change and on our ability to effectively deal with those
  over which we have control or for which we have adaptation options. This ability
  is insufficient at present; although the effects of environmental variability
  are increasingly recognized, the contribution of climate change to such variability
  is not yet clear. </p>
<p><i>Recreational fishing is a highly valued activity that could incur losses
  in some regions as a result of climate-induced changes in fisheries. </i></p>
<p>Recreational fishing is a highly valued activity within North America. In the
  United States, for example, 45 million anglers participate annually; they contribute
  to the economy through spending on fishing and related activities (US$24 billion
  in 1991). The net economic effect of changes in recreational fishing opportunities
  as a result of climate-induced changes in fisheries is dependent on whether
  projected gains in cool- and warm-water fisheries offset losses in cold-water
  fisheries. Work by Stefan et al. (1993) suggests mixed results for the United
  States, ranging from annual losses of US$85-320 million to benefits of about
  US$80 million under a number of GCM projections. A sensitivity analysis (U.S.
  EPA, 1995) was conducted to test the assumption of costless transitions across
  these fisheries. This analysis assumed that best-use cold-water fishery losses
  caused by thermal changes were effectively lost recreational services. Under
  this assumption, all scenarios resulted in damages, with losses of US$619-1,129
  million annually. </p>
