<p>Throughout Africa, the staple crops are cereals-maize in particular. Millet
  and sorghum are widely grown as well; wheat and teff are common in some regions.
  Almost all agriculture is rain-fed, although irrigation is important in some
  regions. The absence of irrigation (less than 10% of the cultivated area is
  irrigated) increases the sensitivity of crop yields to climatic variations.
  Cash crops are important in every country but vary in their distribution and
  profitability. Coffee, tea, groundnuts, cocoa, tobacco, and palm oil are grown
  as cash crops. Other significant crops (at least in terms of household consumption)
  include cassava, yams, legumes, and horticultural crops. Agro-pastoralism and
  extensive nomadic pastoralism are common in semi-arid regions. Relying on grass
  and browse, pastoralism is particularly sensitive to long periods of drought
  when grazing resources are depleted by livestock and not renewed. </p>
<p>The regions of Africa have distinct characteristics. North Africa and the Indian
  Ocean islands rely on irrigated agriculture. In west Africa, the gradient of
  climates from the Sahara to the humid coast determines the potential for agriculture.
  Subsistence agriculture and pastoralism dominate the Sudan and Sahelian regions;
  plantation agriculture is found along the Guinea coast. The highlands of east
  Africa are well known for productive agriculture that takes advantage of the
  two rainy seasons. The lowlands, however, are subject to erratic rainfall and
  poor soils. Coffee and tea are major cash crops in the highlands. The humid
  and sub-humid zones of central Africa, where drought is seldom a problem, are
  conducive to roots and tubers. </p>
<p>Most rural households engage in subsistence agriculture, although large commercial
  estates are found throughout Africa. Moreover, regionally diverse values, cultures,
  and practices in agriculture make for a truly unique region. In many African
  cultures, identity and the measure of personal wealth and value are determined
  by the amount of land one owns, the number of cattle in one's herd, or the amount
  of food produced for the community, rather than monetary wealth. These nuances
  make African agriculture a particularly important sector within the climate
  change debate. </p>
<p>Prolonged drought-lasting a season or longer over a widespread area-is the
  most serious climatic hazard affecting African agriculture, water supplies,
  and ecosystems. If droughts become more common, widespread, and persistent,
  many subhumid and semi-arid regions will have difficulty sustaining viable agricultural
  systems. Drought-prone environments already have been settled and land converted
  from extensive grazing and long-fallow cultivation to permanent cropping. <a href="020.htm#box2-6">Box
  2-6</a> reviews the frequency of drought in Africa and its impacts. </p>
<h4>2.3.3.2.2. Impacts of climate change<a name="2.3.3.2.2"></a> </h4>
<p>The effects of climatic variations on African agriculture have been well established
  through decades of field experiments, statistical analyses of observed yields,
  and monitoring of agricultural production. The most important climatic element
  is precipitation, particularly seasonal drought and the length of the growing
  season. The distribution of rainfall within the growing season also may affect
  yields. Local flooding and storms are minor problems. Low temperatures and radiation
  limit production in some high-elevation regions; frost is a hazard in South
  Africa. High temperatures can affect yields and yield quality in semi-arid and
  arid regions, although water is more important. Sea-level rise and coastal erosion
  will affect groundwater, irrigated agriculture, and low-lying coastal land in
  some areas. </p>
<p>The direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment on plants tend to increase yields and
  reduce water use. Increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations increase the rate of photosynthesis
  and increase water-use efficiency (the efficiency with which plants use water
  to produce a unit of biomass or yield). The direct effects are strongest for
  plants with C<sub>3</sub> pathways, such as wheat, compared with C<sub>4</sub> plants like maize,
  sorghum, millet, and sugarcane-which are staples for much of sub-Saharan Africa.
  CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment also affects weeds, many of which are C<sub>4</sub> plants (Ringius et al.,
  1996). According to the IPCC Second Assessment Report, the effect of a doubling
  in CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (from the present) varies from a 10% increase to almost
  a 300% increase in biomass; WUE may increase by up to 50% (or more) (IPCC, 1996).
  Thus, the beneficial effects of increased concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> are likely to
  offset some of the effects of decreased precipitation. However, the effect of
  CO<sub>2</sub> on crops in Africa-where nutrients often are a limiting factor and leaf
  temperatures are high-remains highly uncertain. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, regional projections of precipitation change diverge quite strongly
  in Africa. For example, scenarios of summer precipitation in the Sahel show
  a range of ±20% for nine atmosphere-ocean GCMs reported in <a href="306.htm">Annex B</a>. However,
  present trends in precipitation in Africa show a decrease in some regions. Recent
  transient scenarios report lower temperature changes, globally as well as for
  Africa. Thus, for agriculture, there is little confidence in present scenarios
  for precipitation-the most important aspect of climate change for African agriculture.
  However, a combination of the potential effects of increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations
  and lower temperatures (at time of doubling) using transient scenarios suggests
  that the impacts of these scenarios may be less severe than those of earlier
  equilibrium GCM model experiments. Nevertheless, even a small decrease in precipitation
  can be significant. Furthermore, few scenarios of drought risk and the distribution
  of rainfall within the growing season have been developed. </p>
<p>Although African agriculture clearly is sensitive to climatic variations, perhaps
  equally important is the gap between present and potential agricultural yields
  in Africa. For example, a serious impact of climate change might be a decrease
  of 20% in maize yields. Yet present yields among smallholders often are only
  half (or even one-tenth) of potential yields. The evaluation of potential impacts
  of climate change should not mask the enormous potential for more-productive
  agricultural systems in Africa (see <a href="023.htm">Section 2.3.3.2.3</a>).

<p><br>
  At the national level, <a href="#figure2-13">Figure 2-13</a> shows the variability
  in national maize yields for selected countries (Hulme, 1996a). The effects
  of the 1984-85 and 1991-92 droughts are clear (see <a href="020.htm#box2-6">Box
  2-6</a>). The coefficient of variation for annual maize yields varies from about
  10% in central Africa to almost 50% in drier countries such as Botswana and
  Swaziland. A significant component of the variability is likely to be related
  to rainfall, although prices and market policies are influential. The role of
  precipitation in agricultural productivity was demonstrated dramatically in
  the Sahel and eastern and southern Africa during the drought period 1970-95
  (Buckland, 1992). Water scarcity revealed widespread dependence on rain-fed
  agriculture and the lack of infrastructural development for supplemental irrigation
  and water resources. For example, Zimbabwe in 1991 and 1992 imported 800,000
  tons of maize, 250,000 tons of wheat, and 200,000 tons of refined and semirefined
  sugar to make up the shortfall associated with reduced agricultural production
  as a result of rainfall shortages (Makarau, 1992). Studies of the role of climatic
  variability in African food security have a long tradition. At the local level,
  agroclimatic studies such as Akong'a et al. (1988), Downing et al. (1990), Mortimore
  (1989), and Sivakumar (1991, 1993) considered the effects of climatic variability
  on agriculture, with an emphasis on coping with drought. Back-to-back drought
  episodes in subhumid and semi-arid zones led to the failure of crop production
  and dependency on other sources of income to buy food, or on famine relief.
</p>
<p>National crop modeling studies that specifically address climate change now
  have been carried out for many countries for a variety of purposes (see Sivakumar,
  1991, 1993; Eid, 1994; Muchena, 1994; Fischer and van Velthuizen, 1996; Makadho,
  1996; Matarira et al., 1996; Sivakumar et al., 1996; USCSP, 1996). Recent studies
  sponsored by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Global Environment
  Facility (GEF), the USCSP, and others are to be published soon. A few regional
  studies have been conducted (e.g., Hulme et al., 1995; Hulme, 1996a; Ringius
  et al., 1996), although an authoritative continental assessment has not been
  compiled. Global studies have included Africa-often, however, using poor data
  or inadequate spatial coverage and ignoring many critical issues of vulnerability
  and food security. </p>
<p>The general conclusion is that climate change will affect some parts of Africa
  negatively, although it will enhance prospects for crop production in other
  areas (see Downing, 1992, for case studies of agriculture in Kenya, Zimbabwe,
  and Senegal). Warmer climates will alter the distribution of agroecological
  zones. Highlands may become more suitable for annual cropping as a result of
  increased temperatures (and radiation) and reduced frost hazards. Although C<sub>3</sub>
  crops exhibit a positive response to increased CO<sub>2</sub> (as much as 30% with 2xCO<sub>2</sub>),
  the optimal productive temperature range is quite narrow. Some regions could
  experience temperature stress at certain growing periods-necessitating shifting
  of planting dates to minimize this risk. Expansion of agriculture is important
  in the east African highlands. For example, agroecological suitability in the
  highlands of Kenya would increase by perhaps 20% with warming of 2.5°C based
  on an index of potential food production (Downing, 1992). In contrast, semi-arid
  areas are likely to be worse off. In eastern Kenya, 2.5°C of warming results
  in a 20% decrease in calorie production. In some lowlands, high-temperature
  events may affect some crops. Growth is hindered by high temperatures, and plant
  metabolism for many cereal crops begins to break down above 40°C. Burke et al.
  (1988) found that many crops manage heat stress (with ample water supply) through
  increased transpiration to maintain foliage temperatures at their optimal range.
  Because a large portion of African agriculture is rain-fed, however, heat-related
  plant stress may reduce yields in several key crops-such as wheat, rice, maize,
  and potatoes. At the other extreme of the C<sub>3</sub> temperature spectrum, several crops
  (such as wheat and several fruit trees) require chilling periods (vernalization).
  Warmer night temperatures could impede vernalization in plants that require
  chilling, such as apples, peaches, and nectarines. Locations suitable for grapes
  and citrus fruit would shift to higher elevations. C<sub>4</sub> crops are more tolerant,
  in general, to climate variations involving temperature ranges between 25°C
  and 35°C. These crops most often are located in warmer, dryer climates; they
  are quite susceptible to water stress. </p>
