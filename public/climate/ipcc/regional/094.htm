<h4>5.1.2. Ecology </h4>
<p>Although much of Europe-particularly the west-originally was covered by forest,
  natural vegetation patterns have been transformed by direct human interference
  through the clearing of land for agriculture and urbanization. Only in the most
  northerly mountains and in parts of northern and central European Russia has
  the forest cover been relatively unaffected by human activity. A considerable
  amount of the continent, however, is covered by woodland that has been planted
  or has reoccupied cleared lands. </p>
<p>The largest vegetation zone in Europe-cutting across the middle portion of
  the continent from the Atlantic to the Urals-is a belt of mixed deciduous and
  coniferous trees (oak, maple, and elm interspersed with pine, fir, and spruce).
  The Arctic coastal regions of northern Europe and the upper slopes of its highest
  mountains are characterized by tundra vegetation, which consists mostly of lichens,
  mosses, herbs, and shrubs. The milder but still cool temperatures of the inland
  parts of northern Europe create an environment favorable to a continuous cover
  of coniferous trees-especially spruce and pine, although birch and aspen also
  occur (Larsen, 1980). Much of the Great European Plain is covered with prairies-areas
  of relatively tall grasses. Further to the east, Ukraine is characterized by
  steppe-a flat and comparatively dry region with short grasses. The Mediterranean
  regions are covered by vegetation that has adapted to generally dry and warm
  conditions; natural vegetation tends to be more sparse in the southern and eastern
  reaches of the Mediterranean basin, reflecting regional differences in precipitation
  and temperature regimes. </p>
<p>At one time Europe was home to a large variety of wild mammals, including deer,
  elk, bison, boar, wolf, and bear. Many species of animals have become extinct
  or have been greatly reduced in number. Today, deer, elk, wolf, and bear occur
  in the wild in significant numbers only in northern Fennoscandia and Russia,
  as well as the Balkan Peninsula. Elsewhere, they exist mainly in protected preserves.
  Indigenous mountain animals have survived human encroachment on their habitats
  (to some extent); chamois and ibex are found in the higher elevations of the
  Pyrenees and Alps. Europe still has many smaller mammals and contains many indigenous
  bird species. </p>
<h4>5.1.3. Population and Demographic Trends<a name="pop"></a> </h4>
<p>Europe has the highest overall population density of all the continents. The
  most heavily populated area includes a belt originating in England and continuing
  eastward through Belgium and the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,
  Poland, and into the European part of Russia. Northern Italy also has a high
  population density. The average annual growth rate for the European population
  during the 1980s was only about 0.3%; by comparison, in the same period, the
  population of Asia grew by about 1.8% per year and that of North America by
  about 0.9% annually. At the same time, wide variations in growth rate occurred
  from country to country in Europe. For instance, during the late 1980s, Albania
  had a yearly growth rate close to 1.9% and Spain about 0.5%, while the population
  of Great Britain did not change appreciably, and that of Germany declined slightly
  (particularly in the former East Germany). The overall slow rate of population
  increase in the latter half of the 20th century has been the result primarily
  of a low birth rate. </p>
<p>Europeans generally enjoy some of the longest average life expectancies at
  birth: 75 years in most countries, compared with less than 60 years in India
  and most countries of Africa. </p>
<h4>5.1.4. Economics <a name="eco"></a></h4>
<p>Europe does not have a homogeneous pattern of wealth and economic development.
  Western and northern Europe have some of the highest standards of living in
  the world in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, life expectancy,
  literacy rate, level of health care, or other common criteria. The standard
  of living in southern Europe today is close to that in most western European
  countries. The new democracies of eastern Europe face major economic difficulties
  related to the rapid transition from the planned economies that prevailed into
  the early 1990s to the free-market economies of today; the Czech Republic, Poland,
  and Hungary have been most successful in the transition to a free-market economy.
  Certain republics of the former Yugoslavia and Albania remain in political turmoil,
  which has severely damaged the national economies of these countries. The emerging
  republics of the former Soviet Union-such as the Baltic states, Ukraine, Belarus,
  and the Russian Federation-are experiencing economic difficulties following
  the collapse of industrial production and guaranteed markets in the former Eastern
  Bloc. GDP per capita ranges from close to US$40,000 per annum in Switzerland
  and Luxemburg to less than US$1,000 per annum in Albania and Macedonia. The
  countries of western Europe have a high level of supranational organization-with
  institutions such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
  (OECD), the European Free Trade Association, and the European Union (EU). With
  the recent fall of communism, eastern European institutions have ceased to exist
  or have become ineffective, and most countries in this region now seek to join
  western institutions. </p>
