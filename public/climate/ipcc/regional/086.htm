<h4>4.3.5.5. Transportation </h4>
<p>The transportation industry has long time frames for investment, is very sensitive
  to weather, and may be affected by climate change in various ways (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Section 11.4.4). Any changes in production systems, such as in agriculture
  and mining, would alter the patterns of demand for transport services. Higher
  temperatures would reduce maximum takeoff payloads for aircraft and increase
  problems with buckling of railway lines and melting or softening of road tar
  surfaces-but also would reduce the risks of winter snow and ice on roads. Any
  changes in winds at flight levels would affect aircraft operations and economics.
  More intense rainfalls would cause more frequent landslides and blockages to
  rail and road routes and might increase flooding impacts on airports, roads,
  rail tracks, and bridges. Any increase in storm frequency or intensity would
  negatively affect all transport operations, especially shipping and airways.
</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand are particularly dependent on efficient, reliable
  transport within their relatively sparse domestic markets and for international
  trade. Impacts on transport services therefore could affect tourism and exports,
  in addition to the direct effects on transport safety and costs. </p>
<p>Because virtually all transport services are fossil fuel-driven, CO<sub>2</sub> emission
  management will result in further impacts on the industry. A detailed consideration
  of Australia's options with respect to transport and climate change mitigation
  (BTCE, 1996) noted several "no regrets" strategies that would have benefits
  for air quality and urban congestion. Adaptation to the potential direct impacts
  of climate change could be dealt with similarly through normal engineering design
  and operations responses, but some residual vulnerability may remain. </p>
<h4>4.3.5.6. Tourism<a name="tourism"></a> </h4>
<p>Tourism is the fastest-growing sector of world trade, and Australasia's share
  of this rising market has been increasing. It represents the most important
  economic use of the region's landscape, biodiversity, and climate-ahead of agriculture
  (it was worth about US$40 billion in 1995-96). The industry is vulnerable to
  climate change in several ways. Coastal resorts, particularly buildings and
  infrastructure, may be vulnerable to sea-level rise and changes in storm surge
  magnitude and frequency, as well as consequential changes in beach extent. Ski
  resorts could be adversely affected (see Section <a href="074.htm">4.3.2.3</a>)
  by shorter snow seasons and an increased need for artificial snow, and resorts
  on the Queensland coast may be affected by any damaging impacts on the Great
  Barrier Reef from coral bleaching or any increased damage from tropical cyclones
  or riverine runoff (see Section <a href="070.htm">4.3.1.5</a>). On the other
  hand, moderate rates of sea-level rise could invigorate coral reef growth, increasing
  the reefs' attractiveness. </p>
<p>Changes also could occur in the prevalence of insect pests and vector-borne
  diseases, affecting tourist health and comfort and resulting in stricter quarantine
  precautions. Human comfort also may change adversely, particularly by warmer
  and possibly more humid conditions, including the number of days of rain, and
  the length of the monsoon and tropical cyclone seasons in northern Australia.
  Any increase in heat and humidity discomfort would increase the demands for
  air conditioning at resorts and could lead to a shift of demand away from tropical
  resorts to cooler locations such as Tasmania or the South Island of New Zealand.
</p>
<h4>4.3.5.7. Adaptation and Vulnerability<a name="adaption"></a> </h4>
<p>A wide range of potential "direct" climatic impacts on settlements and industry,
  largely located in urban areas, has been identified in this section. Several
  other vulnerabilities have been identified elsewhere in this chapter-notably,
  possible increased exposure to fires in the urban fringes (Section <a href="067.htm">4.3.1.3</a>),
  increased riverine flooding (Section <a href="073.htm">4.3.2.2</a>), and extreme
  sea-level events (<a href="083.htm">4.3.4.3</a>). The potential additional
  cost of these "natural disaster" events attributable to climate change is very
  difficult to quantify at present, but it may be very large, and the possibility
  heightens the need for effective current planning, zoning, and engineering standards
  and for improved disaster management. </p>
<p>Most of the direct impacts identified here are relatively small compared to
  other economic influences, and their likely slow development would allow adaptation
  through normal processes of planning, management, and engineering design. However,
  the sectors involved (e.g., energy, mining, transport, tourism, and insurance)
  are very large; therefore, small fractional impacts and small adaptation responses
  could represent substantial total losses and costs. On this basis, a moderate
  degree of vulnerability is present. </p>
