<h4>6.3.2. Hydrology, Water Resources, and Freshwater Fisheries</h4>
<p>Latin America (particularly its tropical region) is rich in freshwater systems.
  Large river basins, lakes, freshwater wetlands, and reservoirs distributed throughout
  the region have facilitated the development of thousands of human settlements-with
  associated agricultural and industrial activities-and the harnessing of rivers
  for energy production. In addition, important segments of national and international
  rivers permit fluvial transportation of people and merchandise. The opening
  of the international Paraguay-Paraná Rivers Hydroway would expedite the increasing
  commercial traffic arising from the developing regional market, Mercosur. Freshwater
  systems also are sources of income from fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism.
  Latin America's extensive river basins, large numbers of lakes, and important
  freshwater wetlands (i.e., El Pantanal and Iberá) host a great number of fish
  species, amphibians, semiaquatic rodents, and reptiles, some of which-like the
  capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochoeris) and yacaré (a type of Caiman latirostris),
  which are particular to this region-are important sources of income for local
  communities. </p>
<p>Tropical rivers in Latin America host about 1,500 species; in addition to their
  commercial value, these species are the basis for the yearly international Alto
  Parana river "dorado" fishing contest, an important tourist event. The wetlands
  also are stopover places for a number of bird species-especially waterfowl,
  which fly back and forth between the United States and Canada and Latin America.
  The longest waterfowl migration probably is that of the blue-winged teal (Anas
  discors), which nests as far north as 60°N in North America and winters south
  of 30°S, traveling a distance of more than 9,600 km. </p>
<p>Freshwater systems are potentially very sensitive to climate change (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Section 10.3) and vulnerable to interannual fluctuations in climate,
  such as those associated with the ENSO phenomenon. Increased climatic variability
  is expected to have greater ecological effects than changes in average conditions.
  Associated flash floods and droughts would reduce the biological diversity and
  productivity of stream ecosystems (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.6) and affect
  living conditions and welfare in flood-prone areas as well as in arid and semi-arid
  regions. Thus, monitoring of associated environmental variables is an urgent
  need. </p>
<p>Most Latin American countries, however, have inadequate hydrological and meteorological
  observation networks. Large, uninhabited areas have no surface observation systems,
  and the densities and operational practices of existing networks generally do
  not meet the recommended international and regional standards. As a result,
  records of variables that are important for the study of freshwater systems
  are scarce and suffer from incomplete areal and temporal coverage, particularly
  because of frequent closings of observation posts in recent decades. Under these
  conditions, water resources monitoring vis-à-vis climate change is very indequate.
  In fact, the 1992 Supplementary Report to the IPCC First Assessment Report (FAR)
  concluded that, although significant progress has been made in hydrological
  sensitivity analyses in developed countries, large gaps exist for less-developed
  countries. </p>
<p>About 35% of the world's continental waters (freshwater) are found in Latin
  America, but the distribution within and among countries is highly variable
  (see <a href="325.htm">Annex D</a> for data on water resources per capita and
  annual domestic and industrial water withdrawals). Many areas (e.g., northern
  Mexico, northeastern Brazil, coastal Peru, northern Chile) have great difficulty
  meeting their water needs. About two-thirds of Latin America is arid or semi-arid,
  including large portions of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, northeastern Brazil,
  Ecuador, Colombia, and central and northern Mexico. </p>
