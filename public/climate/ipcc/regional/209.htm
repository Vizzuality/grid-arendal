<h4>8.3.4.6. Adaptation </h4>
<p>Historically, farming systems have adapted to changing economic conditions,
  technology, and resource availability and have kept pace with a growing population
  (CAST, 1992; Rosenberg, 1992). Evidence exists that agricultural innovation
  responds to economic incentives such as factor prices and can relocate geographically
  (Hayami and Ruttan, 1985; CAST, 1992). A number of studies indicate that adaptation
  and adjustment at all levels-but especially at the farm level-will be important
  to limit losses or to take advantage of improving climatic conditions (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 13.9). Examples of technological options for adaptation
  by agriculture include seasonal changes in sowing dates; different crop varieties
  or species; new crop varieties; water supply and irrigation systems; management
  adjustments with fertilizer, tillage, and so forth; and improved short-term
  climate prediction (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.9.1; Darwin et al., 1995).
  Socioeconomic options for adaptation include improved training and general education
  of populations dependent on agriculture; assessment of currently successful
  strategies for responding to climate variability; improved agricultural research
  to increase the robustness of new farming strategies; interactive communication
  to bring research results to farmers and farmers' problems to researchers; improved
  preservation and maintenance of genetic material critical to adaptation; and
  food programs to buffer against local supply changes. Transportation, distribution,
  and market integration provide additional flexibility for regions to respond
  to climate variability, and changes in policies could increase the adaptive
  capacity of agriculture (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.9.2). </p>
<p><i>Recent analyses of issues of long-run sustainability associated with agricultural
  adaptation to climate change from arbitrary doubling of equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations
  have concluded that there is considerably more sectoral flexibility and adaptation
  potential than was found in earlier analyses. </i></p>
<p>Schimmelpfenning et al. (1996) concluded that the costs and benefits of climate
  change cannot be adequately evaluated independent of behavioral, economic, and
  institutional adjustments required by changing climate. Smit et al. (1996) and
  Brklacich et al. (1997b), in their research into agricultural adaptation to
  climatic variability and change in Ontario, reached a similar conclusion and
  urged that future research into agriculture and climatic change be reframed
  to explicitly consider agricultural decision making and adaptation processes.
  Although scientific controversy remains over the nature and rate of climate
  change and the importance of climate variability, most scenarios suggest gradual
  changes in mean temperature and precipitation over decades, providing opportunities
  for farms and other parts of the sector to adapt. In addition, the time scale
  of 80-100 years makes other profound social changes inevitable. Income and population
  growth and technological innovation will accelerate or decelerate, depending
  on global location, at the same time that adaptation to climate is taking place.
  Social and cultural factors may influence the rate at which adaptation measures
  are implemented within some subregions of North America. There may be time lags
  between decisions to follow an adaptive strategy and subsequent adjustments
  in the agricultural system. The costs and time required for such adjustments
  in infrastructure will need to be considered in planning adaptation options.
  Although none of these factors can be considered in isolation, recent research
  shows that the negative effects of climate change on agriculture probably are
  overestimated by studies that do not account for economic adjustments or consider
  the broader economic and environmental implications of such changes. However,
  uncertainties remain about the implications of changes in climate variability,
  as well as crop responses to increases beyond a doubling of equivalent atmospheric
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. </p>
<h4>8.3.4.7. Vulnerabilities<a name="vuln"></a> </h4>
<p><i>Vulnerability to climate change-induced hunger or severe economic distress
  for the overall economy of North America as a result of climate change impacts
  on the agricultural sector is relatively low.</i> </p>
<p>The United States and Canada have high GNP per capita; the agricultural population
  is a small share of the total population; and agriculture is, in general, a
  small share of the economy. These areas are important for world food production.
  Midcontinental areas of the United States and Canada are prone to drought, which
  would be exacerbated if climate change reduced moisture availability or increased
  the demand for water (as occurs in several GCM scenarios). Economic dislocation
  is likely to be limited to the agricultural sector or to subregions highly dependent
  on agriculture (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.7). Evidence suggests that yields
  of crops grown at the margin of their climatic range or in climates where temperature
  or precipitation could easily exceed threshold values during critical crop growth
  periods are more vulnerable (Matthews et al., 1994a,b; IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
  13.7). A regional economy that offers only limited employment alternatives for
  workers dislocated by the changing profitability of farming is relatively more
  vulnerable than those that are economically diverse. As an example, the Great
  Plains area of North America is most dependent on agriculture and thus might
  be the most economically vulnerable to climate change (Rosenberg, 1993). </p>
