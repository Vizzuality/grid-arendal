<p>Private forest managers have the financial incentive and the latitude to protect
  against extensive loss from climate-related impacts. They can use several available
  techniques: short rotations to reduce the length of time a tree is influenced
  by unfavorable climate conditions; planting of improved varieties developed
  through selection, breeding, or genetic engineering to reduce vulnerability;
  and thinning, weeding, managing pests, irrigating, improving drainage, and fertilizing
  to improve general vigor. Such actions would reduce the risk from moisture stress
  and secondary risks from fire, insects, and disease. Thinning, for example,
  reduces competition for moisture and can effectively increase tolerance to drought;
  it also may speed development of a climate-adapted forest by removing trees
  that are growing poorly (OTA, 1993). However, some adaptive measures such as
  thinning or harvesting dead or dying trees could impact biodiversity, soil erosion,
  stream quality, and nonmarket forest products, generating potentially conflicting
  management options. </p>
<p>Binkley and van Kooten (1994) found that overall impacts on the Canadian forest
  sector would not be significant. This finding was attributed to the ability
  of the production forest sector to adapt to whatever species prevail during
  and after climate change; to salvage-cut dying stands; to plant cut areas with
  species that are better adapted to the projected climate; and to move to locations
  where resources are more plentiful. Long-run sustainable yield levels, however,
  may be reduced as a result of increased losses to fire and insect outbreaks.
  For example, in the Mackenzie Basin Impact Study, a general decline in forest
  production has been suggested for the basin because of a combination of factors-including
  increased area burned, increased susceptibility to pests, and drought-related
  die offs (Cohen, 1997a). </p>
<p><i>A healthy mixed-species, mixed-age forest probably is less susceptible to
  insect infestation than extensive areas of even-aged forest stands.</i> </p>
<p>Planting single-species forests might seem to pose increased threats of loss
  from insect pests or disease because of limited genetic diversity (Perry and
  Maghembe, 1989). However, commercial tree species show a great deal of genetic
  diversity among individuals-even among trees from the same parents (Kitzmiller,
  1993). This inherent diversity could make trees less likely to succumb to a
  single pest or disease than most agricultural crops (Kellison and Weir, 1987).
  Forest managers should attempt to ensure diversity in the seedlings they use
  to establish their forest stands even if they are planting single-species forests
  (OTA, 1993). </p>
<p><i>Once a decline in forest health begins, less intensively managed forests
  may face greater fire and pest damage. At particular risk will be forests already
  subject to moisture stress and fire hazard.</i> </p>
<p>Less-managed forests may not be at any greater inherent risk than actively
  managed forests, however. Once they are subjected to stress, wilderness forests
  and National Parks may be at elevated risk of substantial decline because of
  policy restrictions imposed on silvicultural and pest-management activities.
  Similarly, because management currently is limited on most National Forest lands
  and less-productive nonindustrial private lands, those forests could be at risk
  of unchecked loss. If the general health of these forests declines, their vulnerability
  to large-scale mortality could increase (OTA, 1993). </p>
<p><i>Forests maintained for the production of wood products and fiber would benefit
  from any near-term or long-term increase in productivity. Reduced growth or
  increased mortality would have a damaging effect. Managers of industry forests
  and other private timberlands can be expected to respond with adaptive measures
  if and when they perceive changes in climate and market conditions.</i> </p>
<p>Although no timber company is altering forest practices today, some are actively
  preparing for the types of risks posed by climate change. Weyerhaeuser, for
  example, is conducting experimental silvicultural programs to examine the effects
  of thinning practices in ameliorating the effects of droughts (OTA, 1993). It
  also is sponsoring research on the genetics, physiology, and biotechnology of
  heat- and drought-tolerant seedlings. Such technological development should
  help protect the timber industry and future wood supplies (OTA, 1993). </p>
<p><i>Despite the possibility of some adaptive management responses, climate change
  could be very costly to the timber industry. </i></p>
<p>In the southern United States, declining timber volumes could lead to $300
  million in lost annual revenues, whereas the increased management measures needed
  to compensate for poorer conditions could add $100 million to the annual costs
  of production (Regens et al., 1989; Hodges et al., 1992). A sea-level rise could
  force the movement of coastal pulp and paper mills, further increasing the costs
  of climate change. Some of these mills would cost as much as $1 billion to replace.
  For the Pacific NorthWest, an expanded upslope range of Douglas fir forests
  might add 5% to the regional timber harvest (Hodges et al., 1992). However,
  the increased costs of logging at higher elevations could offset much of this
  potential gain.</p>
<p>A report by the Office of Technology Assessment of the U.S. Congress (OTA,
  1993) identified a number of adaptation strategies that should be considered
  to maintain and enhance commercial forest productivity under climate change.
  These strategies are largely measures that have value to the forest industry
  even without climate change but would serve to ameliorate the impacts of climate
  change as well: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Establish an expanded forest seed-bank program to ensure maintenance of
    genetic diversity. </li>
  <li>Prepare to respond to major forest declines through improved forest health
    maintenance and measures to minimize risk of fire and pest and disease outbreaks.</li>
  <li>Develop new management strategies focused on adaptation to climate change.</li>
  <li>Improve incentives for maintaining and protecting private forestland.</li>
</ul>
