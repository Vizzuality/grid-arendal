<h1>B.2. Simulations with Greenhouse Gas and Aerosol Forcing</h1>
<p>Two simulations (x,w) were forced with the historical increase in equivalent
  CO<sub>2</sub>, then a 1%/yr increase in equivalent CO<sub>2</sub>. The patterns of change are qualitatively
  similar to those in the experiments above. In Sections 6.2.1.2 and 8.4.2.3 of
  the Working Group I contribution to IPCC (1996), we saw that the inclusion of
  the direct sulfate aerosol forcing can improve the simulation of the patterns
  of temperature change over the last few decades. Here we consider the effect
  of combined greenhouse gas and direct sulfate aerosol forcing derived from IS92a
  on simulated patterns of temperature change to 2050 and beyond (y,z). <a href="#figureB-2">Figure
  B-2</a> shows area averages of summer and winter surface temperature, precipitation,
  and soil moisture from two models-one set with CO<sub>2</sub> increase only, the other
  with CO<sub>2</sub> increase and the direct effects of sulfate aerosols. The areas considered
  include five from <a href="307.htm#figureB-1">Figure B-1</a> (i.e., Central
  North America, South East Asia, Sahel, Southern Europe, and Australia). <br>

  Increasing CO<sub>2</sub> alone leads to positive radiative forcing everywhere, with the
  largest radiative heating in regions of clear skies and high temperatures (experiment
  w shown in Figure 6.7a of IPCC 1996, WG I). The surface temperature warms everywhere
  except in the northern North Atlantic (Figure 6.7b of IPCC 1996, WG I). In transient
  simulations to 2050, the inclusion of aerosols based on IS92a (y,z) reduces
  the global mean radiative forcing, and leads to negative radiative forcing over
  southern Asia. This leads to a muted warming or even small regions of cooling
  (y) in mid-latitudes. In (z), China continues to warm, albeit at a very reduced
  rate, even though the local net radiative forcing becomes increasingly negative
  (Figure 6.7c in IPCC 1996, WG I). The rate of warming over North America and
  western Europe, where the aerosol forcing weakens, remains below that in the
  simulation with greenhouse gases only (w). The cooling due to aerosols is amplified
  by sea ice feedbacks in the Arctic (Figure 6.7f in IPCC 1996, WG I). </p>
<p>In assessing these results, one should bear in mind the possible exaggeration
  of the sulfate aerosol concentrations under this scenario, the uncertainties
  in representing the radiative effects of sulfate aerosols, and neglect of other
  factors including the indirect effect of sulfates. Nevertheless, these experiments
  suggest that the direct effect of sulfate aerosols could have strong influence
  on future temperature changes, particularly in northern mid-latitudes. </p>
<h1>B.3. Seasonal Changes in Temperature, Precipitation, and Soil Moisture<a name="b3"></a></h1>
<p>IPCC (1990) reported some broad scale changes that were evident in most of
  the equilibrium 2xCO<sub>2</sub> experiments that were then available. The detailed regional
  changes differed from model to model. In the transient experiments reported
  in IPCC (1992), it was found that the large-scale patterns of response at the
  time of doubling CO<sub>2</sub> were similar to the corresponding equilibrium experiments
  (IPCC, 1990), except that there was a smaller warming in the vicinity of the
  northern North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean in transient experiments. Here
  we summarize the main features in the seasonal (December to February and June
  to August) patterns of change in temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture
  in those experiments with a 1%/yr increase in CO<sub>2</sub> for which data were available.
  The changes are assessed at the time data of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling (after 70 years).
  In experiments w-z, we also contrast the continental-scale response under the
  IS92a scenario with and without aerosol forcing at around 2040. </p>
<h4>B.3.1. Temperature <a name="b31"></a></h4>
<p>With increases in CO<sub>2</sub>, all models produce a maximum annual mean warming in
  high northern latitudes (Figures 6.6 and 6.7b of IPCC 1996, WG I). The warming
  is largest in late autumn and winter, largely due to sea ice forming later in
  the warmer climate. In summer, the warming is small; if the sea ice is removed
  with increased CO<sub>2</sub>, then the thermal inertia of the mixed-layer prevents substantial
  warming during the short summer season, otherwise melting sea ice is present
  in both control and anomaly simulations, and there is no change in surface temperature
  (see Ingram et al., 1989). The details of these changes are sensitive to parameterization
  of sea ice and, in particular, the specification of sea ice albedo (e.g., Meehl
  and Washington, 1995). In one simulation (k), there is a marked cooling over
  the northeastern Atlantic throughout the year, which leads to a cooling over
  part of northWest Europe in winter. There is little seasonal variation of the
  warming in low latitudes or over the southern circumpolar ocean. </p>
<p>When aerosol effects are included (y,z cf. x,w respectively), the maximum winter
  warming in high northern latitudes is less extensive. In mid-latitudes, there
  are some regions of cooling (e.g., over China), and the mean warming in the
  tropics is greater than in mid-latitudes. In northern summer, there are again
  regions of cooling in mid-latitudes and the greatest warming now occurs over
  Antarctica. Again, including the direct forcing by sulfate aerosols has a strong
  effect on simulated regional temperature changes, though the reader should bear
  in mind the limitations of these experiments as noted earlier. </p>
