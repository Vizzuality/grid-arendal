<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This region is defined here as Australia, New Zealand, and their outlying islands.
  Australia is a large, flat continent spanning the tropics to mid-latitudes,
  with relatively nutrient-poor soils and a very arid interior, whereas New Zealand
  is much smaller, mountainous, and well watered. Both have "Gondwanan" ecosystems
  and unique flora and fauna. They have been subject to significant human influences-particularly
  from fire, agriculture, deforestation, and introduced exotic plants and animals.
  The total land area is 8 million square kilometers, and the population is 22
  million. In contrast to other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
  (OECD) countries, commodity-based industries of agriculture and mining dominate
  the economies and exports. Tourism is a major and rapidly growing industry.
</p>
<p>Climate: Australasia's climate is strongly influenced by the surrounding oceans.
  Key climatic features include tropical cyclones and monsoons in northern Australia;
  migratory mid-latitude storm systems in the south, including New Zealand; and
  the El Ni�o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, which causes floods and
  prolonged droughts, especially in eastern Australia. Unfortunately, climate
  models at present cannot provide reliable predictions for these features under
  climate change. </p>
<p>Climate trends: The region's climatic trends are consistent with those of other
  parts of the world. Mean temperatures have risen by up to 0.1�C per decade over
  the past century; nighttime temperatures have risen faster than daytime temperatures;
  and the past decade has seen the highest mean annual temperatures ever recorded.
  Increases in the frequency of heavy rainfalls and average rainfall have been
  reported for large areas of Australia. Sea levels have risen on average by about
  20 mm per decade over the past 50 years. </p>
<p>Climate scenarios: Climate modeling and climate change scenarios for the region
  are relatively well developed. For Australia, the recently revised (1996) Commonwealth
  Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) scenarios for 2030 indicate
  temperature increases of 0.3-1.4�C and rainfall changes of up to 10% in magnitude
  (decreases in winter, increases or decreases in summer, and overall a tendency
  for decreases). The projected changes for 2070 are about twice those of the
  2030 changes. Increases in the intensity of heavy rainfall events are indicated.
  For New Zealand, the temperature increases are expected to be similar to those
  for Australia, but the recent revision indicates the possibility of an increase
  in westerly winds (unlike the decreases of previous scenarios)-and hence precipitation
  increases in the west and precipitation decreases in the east. The changes in
  scenarios serve to caution against overinterpretation of impact studies based
  on any single scenario. </p>
<p>Ecosystems: In responding to climate change, Australasia's biota may face a
  greater rate of long-term change than ever before. They also must respond in
  a highly altered landscape fragmented by urban and agricultural development.
  There is ample evidence for significant potential impacts. Alterations in soil
  characteristics, water and nutrient cycling, plant productivity, species interactions
  (competition, predation, parasitism, etc.), and composition and function of
  ecosystems are highly likely responses to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide
  (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration and temperature and to shifts in rainfall regimes. These
  changes would be exacerbated by any increases in fire occurrence and insect
  outbreaks. </p>
<p>Aquatic systems will be affected by the disproportionately large responses
  in runoff, riverflow and associated nutrients, wastes, and sediments that are
  likely from changes in rainfall and rainfall intensity and by sea-level rise
  in estuaries, mangroves, and other low-lying coastal areas. Australia's Great
  Barrier Reef and other coral reefs are vulnerable to temperature-induced bleaching
  and death of corals, in addition to sea-level rise and weather changes. However,
  there is evidence that the growth of coral reef biota may be sufficient to adapt
  to sea-level rise. Our knowledge of climate change impacts on aquatic and marine
  ecosystems is relatively limited. </p>
<p>Prediction of climate change effects is very difficult because of the complexity
  of ecosystem dynamics. Although Australasia's biota and ecosystems are adapted
  to the region's high climate variability (exemplified in arid and ENSO-affected
  areas), it is unclear whether this will provide any natural adaptation advantage.
  Many species will be able to adapt through altered ecosystem relationships or
  migration, but such possibilities may not exist in some cases, and reduction
  of species diversity is highly likely. Climate change will add to existing problems
  such as land degradation, weed infestations, and pest animals and generally
  will increase the difficulties and uncertainty involved in managing these problems.
</p>
<p>The primary human adaptation option is land-use management-for example, by
  modification of animal stocking rates in rangelands, control of pests and weeds,
  changed forestry practices, and plantings along waterways. Research, monitoring,
  and prediction, both climatic and ecological, will be necessary foundations
  to human adaptive responses. Active manipulation of species generally will not
  be feasible in the region's extensive natural or lightly managed ecosystems,
  except for rare and endangered species or commercially valuable species. In
  summary, it must be concluded that some of the region's ecosystems are very
  vulnerable to climate change. </p>
<p><i>Hydrology and water resources</i>: The four hydrological situations of most
  concern to the region are drought-prone areas, flood-prone urban areas, low-lying
  islands, and alpine snowfields. Model simulations suggest changes of as much
  as �20% in soil moisture and runoff in Australia by 2030, with considerable
  variation from place to place and season to season and with the possibility
  of an overall reduction in average runoff. Water shortages would sharpen competition
  among various uses of water, especially where large diversions are made for
  economic purposes. One study shows Australia's major Murray-Darling River system
  facing constraints on existing irrigation uses and/or harm to the riverine environment.
  More frequent high-rainfall events would enhance groundwater recharge and dam-filling
  events but also would increase the impacts of flooding, landslides, and erosion.
  A preliminary study for an urban area near Sydney showed a tenfold increase
  in the potential damage of the "100-year" flood under a doubled CO<sub>2</sub> scenario.
  Water supplies on atolls and low-lying islands are vulnerable to saltwater intrusion
  of groundwater from rising sea levels and to possible rainfall reductions. Reduced
  snow amounts and a shorter snow season appear likely and would decrease the
  amenity value of the mountains and the viability of the ski industry. The glaciers
  of New Zealand's Southern Alps are likely to shrink further. </p>
<p>Adaptation options include integrated catchment management, changes to water
  pricing systems, water efficiency initiatives, building or rebuilding engineering
  structures, relocation of buildings, urban planning and management, and improved
  water supply measures in remote areas and low-lying islands. The financial exposure,
  and cost involved in potential adaptations, indicate a high vulnerability with
  respect to hydrology. </p>
