<h1>North America</h1>
<p>This region consists of Canada and the United States south of the Arctic Circle.
  Within the region, vulnerability to and the impacts of climate change vary significantly
  from sector to sector and from subregion to subregion. This "texture" is important
  in understanding the potential effects of climate change on North America, as
  well as in formulating and implementing viable response strategies. </p>
<p><i>Ecosystems</i>: Most ecosystems are moderately to highly sensitive to changes
  in climate. Effects are likely to include both beneficial and harmful changes.
  Potential impacts include northward shifts of forest and other vegetation types,
  which would affect biodiversity by altering habitats and would reduce the market
  and non-market goods and services they provide; declines in forest density and
  forested area in some subregions, but gains in others; more frequent and larger
  forest fires; expansion of arid land species into the great basin region; drying
  of prairie pothole wetlands that currently support over 50% of all waterfowl
  in North America; and changes in distribution of habitat for cold-, cool-, and
  warm-water fish. The ability to apply management practices to limit potential
  damages is likely to be low for ecosystems that are not already intensively
  managed. </p>
<p><i>Hydrology and Water Resources</i>: Water quantity and quality are particularly
  sensitive to climate change. Potential impacts include increased runoff in winter
  and spring and decreased soil moisture and runoff in summer. The Great Plains
  and prairie regions are particularly vulnerable. Projected increases in the
  frequency of heavy rainfall events and severe flooding also could be accompanied
  by an increase in the length of dry periods between rainfall events and in the
  frequency and/or severity of droughts in parts of North America. Water quality
  could suffer and would decline where minimum river flows decline. Opportunities
  to adapt are extensive, but their costs and possible obstacles may be limiting.
</p>
<p><i>Food and Fiber Production</i>: The productivity of food and fiber resources
  of North America is moderately to highly sensitive to climate change. Most studies,
  however, have not fully considered the effects of potential changes in climate
  variability; water availability; stresses from pests, diseases, and fire; or
  interactions with other, existing stresses. Warmer climate scenarios (4-5ï¿½C
  increases in North America) have yielded estimates of negative impacts in eastern,
  southeastern, and corn belt regions and positive effects in northern plains
  and western regions. More moderate warming produced estimates of predominately
  positive effects in some warm-season crops. Vulnerability of commercial forest
  production is uncertain, but is likely to be lower than less intensively managed
  systems due to changing technology and management options. The vulnerability
  of food and fiber production in North America is thought to be low at the continental
  scale, though subregional variation in losses or gains is likely. The ability
  to adapt may be limited by information gaps; institutional obstacles; high economic,
  social, and environmental costs; and the rate of climate change. </p>
<p><i>Coastal Systems</i>: Sea level has been rising relative to the land along
  most of the coast of North America, and falling in a few areas, for thousands
  of years. During the next century, a 50-cm rise in sea level from climate change
  alone could inundate 8,500 to 19,000 km<sup>2</sup> of dry land, expand the 100-year floodplain
  by more than 23,000 km<sup>2</sup>, and eliminate as much as 50% of North America's coastal
  wetlands. The projected changes in sea level due to climate change alone would
  underestimate the total change in sea level from all causes along the eastern
  seabord and Gulf coast of North America. In many areas, wetlands and estuarine
  beaches may be squeezed between advancing seas and dikes or seawalls built to
  protect human settlements. Several local governments are implementing land-use
  regulations to enable coastal ecosystems to migrate landward as sea level rises.
  Saltwater intrusion may threaten water supplies in several areas. </p>
<p><i>Human Settlements</i>: Projected changes in climate could have positive
  and negative impacts on the operation and maintenance costs of North American
  land and water transportation. Such changes also could increase the risks to
  property and human health and life as a result of possible increased exposure
  to natural hazards (e.g., wildfires, landslides, and extreme weather events)
  and result in increased demand for cooling and decreased demand for heating
  energy-with the overall net effect varying across geographic regions. </p>
<p><i>Human Health</i>: Climate can have wide-ranging and potentially adverse
  effects on human health via direct pathways (e.g., thermal stress and extreme
  weather/climate events) and indirect pathways (e.g., disease vectors and infectious
  agents, environmental and occupational exposures to toxic substances, food production).
  In high-latitude regions, some human health impacts are expected due to dietary
  changes resulting from shifts in migratory patterns and abundance of native
  food sources. </p>
<p><i>Conclusions</i>: Taken individually, any one of the impacts of climate change
  may be within the response capabilities of a subregion or sector. The fact that
  they are projected to occur simultaneously and in concert with changes in population,
  technology, economics, and other environmental and social changes, however,
  adds to the complexity of the impact assessment and the choice of appropriate
  responses. The characteristics of subregions and sectors of North America suggest
  that neither the impacts of climate change nor the response options will be
  uniform. </p>
<p>Many systems of North America are moderately to highly sensitive to climate
  change, and the range of estimated effects often includes the potential for
  substantial damages. The technological capability to adapt management of systems
  to lessen or avoid damaging effects exists in many instances. The ability to
  adapt may be diminished, however, by the attendant costs, lack of private incentives
  to protect publicly owned natural systems, imperfect information regarding future
  changes in climate and the available options for adaptation, and institutional
  barriers. The most vulnerable sectors and regions include long-lived natural
  forest ecosystems in the east and interior west; water resources in the southern
  plains; agriculture in the southeast and southern plains; human health in areas
  currently experiencing diminished urban air quality; northern ecosystems and
  habitats; estuarine beaches in developed areas; and low-latitude cool- and cold-water
  fisheries. Other sectors and subregions may benefit from opportunities associated
  with warmer temperatures or, potentially, from CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization-including west
  coast coniferous forests; some western rangelands; reduced energy costs for
  heating in the northern latitudes; reduced salting and snow-clearance costs;
  longer open-water seasons in northern channels and ports; and agriculture in
  the northern latitudes, the interior west, and the west coast. </p>
