<h4>2.3.3.2.3. Adaptation and vulnerability</h4>
<p>Low investment in agriculture (see <a href="021.htm#table2-7">Table 2-7</a>)
  means that African agriculture is extremely sensitive to climatic fluctuations.
  The current status of agriculture is not encouraging: It is characterized by
  stagnant yields, land degradation, and recurrent droughts (<a href="#box2-7">Box
  2-7</a> suggests strategies to cope with current levels of climate variability
  and drought). Furthermore, political conflicts have adversely affected food
  production, making the continent extremely vulnerable to climate change. Without
  a sound agricultural sector, Africa is unlikely to develop diversified economies
  that can cope with the impact of climate change. Thus, the impact of climate
  change on agriculture and food security in Africa over the next few decades
  will depend on progress in applied agricultural research and development. <br>

      <p>The loss of human life and economic disruption associated with extreme
	climatic fluctuation can be lessened by enhancing household coping strategies,
	preparedness, and advanced warning and timely responses. The initial aim
	in responding to drought is to maintain household livelihoods and mitigate
	the effects of rainfall shortages. Seasonal hunger, poverty, and household
	crises recur among vulnerable households throughout Africa. It is often
	difficult for governments, donors, and non-governmental organizations
	(NGOs) to distinguish between chronic conditions and an emerging crisis
	during a drought (or other shock). Recent scientific advances in understanding
	the climate system and predicting seasonal drought provide an opportunity
	to reduce the vulnerability of human societies (Rasmusson, 1987; Hastenrath,
	1995; Bonkoungou, 1996). Predictions of seasonal rainfall already are
	operational in many regions of Africa, with lead times of up to several
	months. Longer-term forecasts also may be possible. However, drought predictions
	still need to be incorporated into African management of agriculture,
	water, energy, and national economies (see Gibberd et al., 1996). </p>
      <p>Increasing drought preparedness in Africa has resulted in a plethora
	of organizations that monitor climate, agriculture, vegetation, and resources;
	make available early-warning information; participate in multidisciplinary
	research; and promote preparedness plans. International early-warning
	systems such as the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization,
	Save the Children Fund, U.S. Famine Early Warning System, and Agence Europèene
	pour le Développement et la Santé, among others, link local and national
	efforts with international responses. Following the devastating droughts
	of the 1970s in the Sahel, the AGRHYMET center was established in Niger.
	The SADC has a similar program on food security. Drought monitoring centers
	in Kenya and Zimbabwe and the African Centre for Meteorological Applications
	in Development were established in the 1990s. National departments, universities,
	and NGOs also have been active in promoting drought monitoring, mitigation,
	and preparedness. By monitoring key indicators of staple food production,
	national stocks, and import availability, a rough and ready national balance
	can be calculated using population estimates and per capita needs (SADC,
	1996). Most famine early-warning systems (EWSs) predict the failure of
	food systems (Wilhite and Easterling, 1987). Increasingly, the focus of
	monitoring and intervention has been on food-insecure people who strive
	to subsist within food systems, rather than national food balances per
	se (Davies, 1996). Many EWSs now monitor upstream determinants of production
	(such as rainfall and soil moisture) as well as downstream outcome indicators
	(such as market prices for food and the nutritional status of those most
	vulnerable). Vulnerability assessment (and mapping) is one tool for integrating
	the climatic, production, and socioeconomic dimensions of drought in the
	context of sustainable development. Unfortunately, the focus often remains
	on food balances and food crises rather than solving chronic hunger and
	enhancing the livelihoods of the most vulnerable populations. </p>
      <p>Early warnings do not guarantee effective responses. Early warnings by
	the drought monitoring centers and national meteorological services of
	a severe drought in 1991 were largely ignored by government and donor
	agencies (SADC, 1994). Economic structural adjustment programs failed
	to take rainfall variability into account in their design and emphasis
	on reform. Thus, numerous countries were poorly prepared, without a national
	disaster management program in place. There were conflicts over statistics
	used in emergency programs-where data from different sources were not
	reconciled-which led to delays in response. The response to the 1990s
	drought in Kenya was more positive; one month after the drought was apparent,
	large-scale food imports were made, and local food stocks were utilized
	(Longhurst, 1992; see Downing et al., 1990, for a description of the similar
	success in 1984-1985). Preprogrammed drought responses also assisted in
	averting a major crisis: In northern Kenya, a decentralized early-warning
	system was well developed, and recommendations were translated rapidly
	into firm decisions to mitigate the impact of the drought. </p>
      <p>Local coping strategies for drought and famine are well illustrated in
	the inner Niger delta of the Malian Sahel (Davies, 1996). Famine, although
	not entirely absent, is not a common occurrence in the Sahel. Periods
	of drought have been more frequent since the late 1960s, although there
	is little consensus regarding their origin or whether such drought is
	a permanent trend. Over the past 30 years or so, drought and famine have
	been part of a downward spiral of impoverishment, increasing vulnerability,
	destitution, and sometimes death. As a result of the Sahelian droughts
	of the early 1970s and the mid-1980s, fundamental changes are taking place
	in the livelihoods of people as they adapt to confront declining food
	security. Local livelihood systems have become less resilient and more
	sensitive (more vulnerable) to food stress with successive periods of
	drought. The nature and degree of vulnerability vary according to the
	livelihood system. Famines could be mitigated if policymakers can recognize
	and reinforce local coping strategies. </p>
      <p>Lessons learned in responding to drought in Africa need to be widely
	implemented to reduce the threat of famine and enhance livelihood security.
	Promising developments in climate prediction and experience in early warning
	and responses lay the foundation for ending famine in Africa. Responses
	to drought also provide insight into effective adaptation to climate change.
	Reducing present vulnerability reduces the threat of catastrophic impacts.
	Institutional management of present climatic hazards should support adaptive
	learning to cope with future climate change.</p>
