<h4>4.3.4.4. Adaptation and Vulnerability </h4>
<p>The specific options for adaptation are wide-ranging. Often the existing capital
  assets could be used to the end of their design life and rebuilt to suit higher
  sea levels and increased risks of coastal erosion and flooding. In some cases,
  however, there may be a need for costly raising or relocation of railways, ports,
  bridges, dams, highways, electricity lines, and so forth; in other cases, the
  preferred option may be to build protective dikes, seawalls, and pumping systems.
  "Softer" options include setbacks of development zones, beach nourishment, dune
  protection, and phased retreat plans-options that increasingly are perceived
  as viable alternatives, especially in coastal zones facing high development
  pressures. These options are set out in guidelines issued by the Australian
  Institution of Engineers (1991). </p>
<p>The time frame for response to sea-level rise is sufficient, in principle,
  to allow for the development of suitable coastal policies and management practices
  to adjust. At present, however, in Australia coastal hazards are generally not
  well accommodated within current coastal management planning frameworks. This
  was highlighted for Australia in the Report of the Coastal Zone Enquiry (Resource
  Assessment Commission, 1993), which recommended a National Coastal Action Plan.
  The approaches to coastal hazard management of the six Australian states are
  summarized in Kay et al. (1996). In most cases, there is some way to go to factor
  in the relatively long-term issue of climate change. </p>
<p>In New Zealand, the overarching national policies attempt to guide and encourage
  adaptation at the local level. The RMA requires that alternative options be
  systematically evaluated during local resource consent procedures (s.32). The
  New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement directs that a "precautionary approach"
  should be adopted and states that reliance on coastal protection works should
  be avoided; an emphasis should be placed instead on the enhancement of natural
  protective features of coastal systems and on the location and design of new
  developments to avoid hazardous situations. This policy framework in New Zealand
  is a potentially powerful mechanism for promoting adaptation to reduce the impacts
  of climate change in the coastal zone. However, it is too soon to assess its
  effectiveness because very few regional and district policies and plans have
  completed the lengthy public submission and appeal processes required. </p>
<p>For the future, a key strategy for the Australasia region will be to consider
  adaptation options within the context of integrated coastal zone management
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 9.6.4). Within this increasingly accepted approach,
  the necessary detailed hazard mapping, monitoring, and policy development can
  occur, and a range of sociocultural, structural, legal, financial, economic,
  and institutional measures can be developed to deal with any additional climate-related
  risks. Such advance planning may substantially reduce the later costs of adaptation.
