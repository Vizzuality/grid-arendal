<h1>4.2. Regional Climate Information </h1>
<h4>4.2.1. Current Climate<a name="current"></a> </h4>
<p><i>Summary: Australasia's climate is strongly influenced by the surrounding
  oceans. Key climatic features include tropical cyclones and monsoons in northern
  Australia; migratory mid-latitude storm systems in the south, including New
  Zealand; and the ENSO phenomenon, which causes floods and prolonged droughts,
  especially in eastern Australia. Unfortunately, climate models at present cannot
  provide reliable predictions for these features under climate change. </i></p>
<p>The region's climate is strongly influenced by its oceanic context. Northern
  Australia, lying just south of the Western Pacific oceanic "warm pool," experiences
  tropical conditions, with a summer monsoon (Sturman and Tapper, 1996). Tropical
  cyclones (averaging six per year) are a major concern for northern coastal regions.
  Cyclones can track southward as far as New Zealand, bringing very high rainfalls
  (Sinclair, 1993a, b). Western and central Australia experience generally clear,
  dry conditions owing to large-scale subsidence. In the winter half-year, eastward-moving
  anticyclones cross the continent, and northern areas are influenced by mild,
  dry, southeast tradewinds. In the summer half-year, the anticyclones cross at
  higher latitudes-bringing fine weather to southern Australia and to New Zealand.
</p>
<p>South of about 35°S there are increasingly strong westerly winds, within which
  large-scale atmospheric waves develop. The resulting migratory cyclonic and
  anticyclonic systems are key features of the weather of New Zealand, Tasmania,
  and the southern coasts of Australia, especially during winter (Maunder, 1971;
  Sturman and Tapper, 1996). The eastward progression of these weather systems
  brings cycles of warm northerly conditions followed by depressions, fronts,
  and sometimes severe outbreaks of cold air from the Southern Ocean. </p>
<p>Australia's generally low relief (apart from Tasmania and the Great Dividing
  Range parallel to the east coast) does not significantly affect the weather
  regimes. Because of the size of the continent, however, the rain-bearing weather
  systems progressively dry out as they penetrate inland, resulting in a very
  arid central desert region (Sturman and Tapper, 1996). Australia is the driest
  populated continent; two-thirds of the land is classified as arid or semi-arid
  (<400 mm annual rainfall). About 87% of all rainfall is lost to evaporation
  from the land surface and vegetation, compared to 60% for the United States
  and Europe. Less than 5% of Australia has an average annual runoff greater than
  250 mm; 26% of the land surface contributes more than 88% of total runoff, and
  half the land surface has no direct discharge to the ocean. </p>
<p>An important feature of the region's climate is the ENSO phenomenon, which
  causes high year-to-year variability, especially of rainfall in northern and
  eastern Australia. The ENSO phenomenon involves the interaction of the tropical
  Pacific Ocean with the global atmosphere and shifts in the major climatic patterns
  of the globe every 2-5 years or so (McBride and Nicholls, 1983; Rasmusson and
  Wallace, 1983; Bureau of Meteorology, 1989; McCreary and Anderson, 1991; Trenberth,
  1991). During "El Niño" years-which are marked by unusually warm sea surface
  temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean-Australia experiences reduced
  rainfall and extensive and often prolonged droughts, with severe impacts on
  rural communities and agricultural production. Major wildfires also can occur.
  At the opposite phase of the oscillation, during "La Niña" years, flooding is
  common. Australia has been described as a land of drought and flooding rains.
</p>
<p>Owing to its generally low rainfall and low runoff and the large seasonal and
  ENSO-related variations, Australia's hydrological features are significantly
  different from almost all other regions and continents (Finlayson and McMahon,
  1988; McMahon and Finlayson, 1991; Fleming, 1995; Thomas and Bates, 1997). The
  variability of Australian rainfall and runoff is among the greatest in the world:
  two to four times those of northWestern Europe and North America for the same
  climatic zones. Compared with other nations, the frequency and duration of drought
  is extreme, though these are interspersed with sequences of above-average rainfall.
  About 25% of the variance in annual rainfall is attributable to the ENSO phenomenon.
  Most of Australia's major rivers have ceased to flow at least once during the
  past 100 to 200 years, and groundwater levels show remarkable variations through
  time. </p>
<p>In contrast, New Zealand has a maritime climate; few places are more than 100
  km from the coast. Rainfall is relatively well-distributed by region and season,
  and the influence of the ENSO phenomenon on year-to-year variations is less
  than in Australia. Mountains rising to 2000-3000 m transverse to the prevailing
  westerly winds result in very wet conditions in western areas and drier "rainshadow"
  conditions in eastern areas. In the west of the South Island, annual rainfall
  can be as much as 12,000 mm, with high runoff, steep torrents, extensive permanent
  snow fields at high altitudes, and fast-moving glaciers. Barely a few tens of
  kilometers to the east, annual rainfall may be as low as 500 mm. The eastern
  plains experience summer drought, which sometimes extends to spring and autumn.
