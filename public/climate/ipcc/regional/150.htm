<h1>6.5. Monitoring and Research Needs </h1>
<p>Latin America has the expertise needed for the study of climate, climate variability,
  and climate change-as is apparent from the relatively ample bibliography of
  research by local authors. This expertise is important because recent observations
  have shown that the Southern Hemisphere, where the largest portion of the region
  lies, is warming more than the Northern Hemisphere. The very heavily-populated
  land masses in the north produce more atmospheric pollution (in particular,
  sulfate aerosols and particulates), which dampens the heating capacity of solar
  radiation on the Earth. This situation is quite different from that in the oceanic
  Southern Hemisphere, where the distribution and density of air pollutants are
  remarkably lower. As a result, the absorption and reflection of incoming solar
  radiation do not counteract the background release of GHGs to the extent that
  they do in the north. </p>
<p>Other characteristics further differentiate the two hemispheres. The geographical
  features of the Southern Hemisphere (and Latin America in particular) consist
  mainly of a solid continent on the South Pole (the Antarctic); a very large
  oceanic mass with a well-known thermal moderating capacity; a subcontinent (South
  America) extending to the southernmost latitudes; and a vertebral mountain chain
  (the Cordillerra de los Andes) running from north to south over the entire subcontinent-all
  sandwiched between the two largest oceans of the world. Another important difference
  affecting the middle atmosphere over this region is the seasonal and regional
  formation of the Antarctic ozone hole. This remarkable stratospheric ozone depletion,
  combined with dynamic changes in middle atmospheric circulation, has the double
  impact of creating a window for infrared radiation-which globally compensates
  about 25% of GHG warming effects-and increasing the amount of ultraviolet-B
  (UV-B) radiation that reaches the ground, with direct effects on the region's
  terrestrial and marine ecosystems. </p>
<p>Thus, there is room not only for improving mathematical models to encompass
  hemispheric peculiarities (as is being done in Australasia) but also for developing
  appropriate regional climate models that should have the capacity, inter alia,
  to provide appropriate climate scenarios for running hydrological models for
  the region's river basins. </p>
<p>This analysis once again underscores the fact that the region suffers from
  insufficiently dense and reliable observation networks and that other basic
  information-biological, economic, and social-necessary to build up complete
  and coherent regional scenarios is missing. Last but not least, appropriate
  coordination with the Australasian countries, as well as with the United States
  and Canada, is becoming more and more critical because of common factors affecting
  climate variability (e.g., the ENSO phenomenon) and climate change over these
  regions. </p>
<p>In summary, the situation in Latin America calls for specific research initiatives;
  comprehensive ecological and socioeconomic databases; appropriate data validation
  techniques; proxy data capture, particularly regarding the neighboring Antarctic
  continent (which began keeping regional records only after the 1958 geophysical
  year); and appropriate training of personnel, particularly regarding integrated
  assessments and development of appropriate adaptation option methodologies.
  More fundamental research on ecosystem functioning, hydrographic systems, and
  interactions between land use and technological approaches by different communities
  is indispensable for the region to thoroughly undertake integrated assessments
  of potential impacts of climate change and develop appropriate adaptation and
  mitigation alternatives. Therefore, combined actions with countries in neighboring
  regions, such as those already implemented through joint activities with the
  USCSP, and the organization of activities within the Valdivia Group-which associates
  Latin American countries in the temperate Southern Hemisphere with activities
  of common interest in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa-are in order.
  The participation of grassroots organizations and NGOs also is essential for
  achieving sustainable development in the region vis-à-vis climate change. </p>
