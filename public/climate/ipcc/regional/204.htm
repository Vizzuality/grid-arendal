<h4>8.3.4. Food and Fiber: Agriculture </h4>
<h4>8.3.4.1. Description of the Resource <a name="des"></a></h4>
<p>Agricultural land represents about 12% of the land area of North America. Approximately
  3% of the population and 1.7% of the annual growth in gross national product
  (GNP) are related to agriculture. Agricultural land use comprises a total of
  approximately 233 million ha. Irrigated farmland represents 21 million ha in
  the United States, with much of this along the Mississippi River, the central
  Great Plains, and the western states. North America is characterized by an abundance
  of fertile soils and a highly productive agricultural sector that leads the
  world in the production of small grains. Within the United States, there are
  10 farm production regions, with 6 corresponding regions in Canada (Adams et
  al., 1995b; Brklacich et al., 1997a). </p>
<p>Agriculture in North America has a long history of sensitivity to climate variability
  (e.g., the timing and magnitude of droughts and floods, extremes in heat and
  cold) and is subject to a wide array of other factors that can limit potential
  productivity (e.g., tropospheric ozone, pests, diseases, and weeds). Agriculture
  has an equally long history of developing strategies to cope with the many factors
  capable of limiting production. Climate change is an additional factor that
  could enhance or reduce the sensitivity of the agricultural sector to these
  current stress factors. As world population grows, the demand for North American
  agricultural products is expected to increase, with possible increases in agricultural
  commodity prices (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.6.8). Should increased demand
  lead to further intensification of agriculture in North America, increased emphasis
  on sustainable agriculture is likely (Matson et al., 1997). </p>
<h4>8.3.4.2. Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture<a name="pot"></a></h4>
<p>Potential impacts of climate change on agriculture will be reflected most directly
  through the response of crops, livestock, soils, weeds, and insects and diseases
  to the elements of climate to which they are most sensitive. Soil moisture and
  temperature are the climate factors likely to be most sensitive to change across
  large agricultural areas of North America. The differential response of species
  to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations is expected to show a generally positive but
  variable increase in productivity and WUE for annual crops; limited evidence
  suggests less of a growth response for perennial crop species. Many weed species
  are expected to benefit from CO<sub>2</sub> "fertilization" and increased WUE, and increased
  temperatures may facilitate the expansion of warm-season weed species to more
  northerly latitudes (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.2). Insect pests and fungal
  and bacterial pathogens of importance to agricultural production are sensitive
  to climate change through the direct effects of changes of temperature and moisture
  on the pest or pathogen, on host susceptibility, and on the host-parasite interrelation
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.4). Livestock is sensitive to climate through
  impacts on feed and forage crops, through the direct effects of weather and
  extreme events on animal health, and through changes in livestock diseases (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 13.5). </p>
<p>Long-term crop management strategies that increase soil organic matter will
  benefit agricultural lands by increasing soil nutrient status and water-holding
  capacity while increasing soil carbon storage (Matson et al., 1997). </p>
<h4>8.3.4.3. Climate Variability and Extreme Events<a name="cli"></a> </h4>
<p><i>Changes in mean temperature and precipitation will likely affect agricultural
  crop and livestock production. Climate modifications that lead to changes in
  daily and interannual variability in temperatures and, in particular, precipitation
  also will impact crop yields. </i></p>
<p>Mearns et al. (1996) used the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES)-Wheat
  model to demonstrate the impact of daily temperature variability on simulated
  wheat yields at two sites in Kansas. A doubling of daily temperature variability
  contributed to increased crop failures and lower yields as a consequence of
  cold damage and winter kill. Simulated wheat yields also decreased as variability
  in precipitation increased, although absolute reductions in yield were dependent
  on soil type and associated moisture-holding capacity. Although these simulations
  illustrate the potential sensitivity of wheat production to increased variability
  in temperature and precipitation, they do not incorporate the beneficial role
  that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> may play in modifying these responses, nor are extreme events
  considered in these analyses. Extreme events like drought, flooding, hail, hurricanes,
  and tornadoes also will impact agriculture, but reliable forecasts of such occurrences
  are not yet regionally available. </p>
