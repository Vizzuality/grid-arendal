<h4>8.3.3. Hydrology and Water Resources </h4>
<h4>8.3.3.1. Hydrological Trends and Variability<a name="trend"></a> </h4>
<p>Several reports of recent trends in precipitation and streamflow have shown
  generally increasing values throughout much of the United States; in Canada,
  total precipitation trends indicate an increase, but monthly streamflow analyses
  show varying seasonal changes. Lettenmaier et al. (1994) analyzed data over
  the period 1948-88 and found generally increasing trends in precipitation during
  the months of September to December and increasing trends in streamflow during
  the months of November to April, particularly in the central and north-central
  portions of the United States. Similarly, Lins and Michaels (1994) report that
  streamflow has increased throughout much of the conterminous United States since
  the early 1940s, with the increases occurring primarily in autumn and winter.
  In Louisiana, precipitation and simulated runoff (streamflow per unit drainage
  area) have increased significantly over the past 100 years (Keim et al., 1995).
</p>
<p>Mekis and Hogg (1997) analyzed annual and seasonal precipitation (total, rain
  and snow) trends for periods from 1948-96 to 1895-1996 for regions of Canada
  and noted significant increases in total annual precipitation and snow for most
  regions. In Ontario, 41 hydrometric stations with a minimum of 30 years of data
  ending in 1990 were analyzed by Ashfield et al. (1991). Mean monthly flows increased
  for the period September to January in more than 50% of the stations; approximately
  25% of the stations show a downward trend in flow for the April to September
  period. Anderson et al. (1991) analyzed low-, average-, and maximum-flow time
  series for 27 stations (unregulated flow) across Canada; the data show a decrease
  in summer low flows and an increase in winter average and low flows but little
  trend in seasonal maximum flows. Burn (1994) analyzed the long-term record of
  84 unregulated river basins from northWestern Ontario to Alberta for changes
  in the timing of peak spring runoff. In the sample, the more northerly rivers
  exhibited a trend to earlier spring snowmelt runoff; the observed impacts on
  timing were more prevalent in the recent portion of data. These trends generally
  are consistent with climate models that produce an enhanced hydrological cycle
  with increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and warmer air temperatures, although some of
  the streamflow trends also may be the result of water-management or land-use
  changes that reduce surface infiltration and storage. </p>
<p>Recent investigations have shown how natural modes of variability at scales
  from seasons to years (e.g., ENSO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation) affect hydrological
  variability in different regions of North America and thereby have underlined
  the importance of increasing our understanding of the roles these features play
  in influencing hydrological characteristics. The ENSO phenomenon, a predictable
  climate signal, affects precipitation and streamflow in the northWestern, north-central,
  northeastern, and Gulf coast regions of the United States (Kahya and Dracup,
  1993; Dracup and Kahya, 1994). For example, La Niña events (the cold phase of
  the ENSO phenomenon) produce higher than normal precipitation in winter in the
  northWestern United States, whereas El Niño events (the warm phase of the ENSO
  phenomenon) cause drier winters in the NorthWest on roughly a bidecadal time
  scale. Precipitation over a large region of southern Canada extending from British
  Columbia through the prairies and into the Great Lakes shows a distinct pattern
  of negative precipitation anomalies during the first winter following the onset
  of El Niño events; positive anomalies occur in this region with La Niña events.
  On the other hand, the northern prairies and southeastern NorthWest Territories
  show significant positive precipitation anomalies with El Niño events (Shabbar
  et al., 1997). Variability in ENSO phenomena contributes natural variations
  in hydrology at decadal and longer time scales that are problematic for CO<sub>2</sub>
  climate change analysis. Changes in ENSO behavior related to increasing CO<sub>2</sub>
  are highly uncertain but could produce enhanced variability in precipitation
  and streamflow for the regions most sensitive to ENSO fluctuations (IPCC 1996,
  WG I, Section 6.4.4). </p>
<p>Wetlands in North America traditionally have been viewed as wasted land available
  for conversion to more productive use. This opinion has contributed to the loss
  of millions of wetland hectares that have been drained or filled for agriculture,
  highways, housing, and industry. In Canada, where wetlands occupy an estimated
  14% of the landscape, 65-80% of Atlantic coastal marshes, southern Ontario wetlands,
  prairie potholes, and the Fraser River delta have been lost-largely to agriculture
  (Environment Canada, 1986, 1988). Figures for the United States indicate that
  approximately 53% of the original wetland area in the lower 48 states has been
  lost, mostly (87% of this figure) to agriculture (Maltby, 1986). These losses
  are accompanied by the loss of ecological, hydrological, and cultural functions
  wetlands provide, including water purification, groundwater recharge/discharge,
  stormwater storage/flood control, sediment and pollutant sequestering, carbon
  storage, cycling of sulfur, and wildlife habitat (Mitsch and Gosselink, 1986;
  IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 6). </p>
<p>Socioeconomically, wetlands provide direct benefits through the harvesting
  of timber, wild rice, cranberries, and horticultural peat-as well as through
  recreational activities such as hunting, fishing, and bird watching. The cultures
  and spiritual values of many First Nation peoples are linked to the health of
  wetlands. </p>
