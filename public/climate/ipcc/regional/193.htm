<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Most of the early CO<sub>2</sub> research was done on juvenile trees in pots and growth
  chambers, which may limit the usefulness of some conclusions. New research is
  beginning to emerge that focuses on larger trees or intact forested ecosystems.
  Recent reviews of this newer literature (Curtis, 1996; Eamus, 1996a) indicate
  that acclimation may not be as prevalent when roots are unconstrained; that
  leaf conductance may not be reduced; and that both responses depend on the experimental
  conditions, the length of exposure, and the degree of nutrient or water stress.
  These results imply that forests could produce more leaf area under elevated
  CO<sub>2</sub> but may not gain a benefit from increased WUE. In fact, with increased leaf
  area, transpiration should increase on a per-tree basis, and the stand would
  use more water (Eamus, 1996a). Elevated temperatures would increase transpiration
  even further, perhaps drying the soil and inducing a drought effect on the ecosystem
  (Eamus, 1996a). </p>
<p>Nitrogen supply is prominent among the environmental influences that are thought
  to moderate long-term responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (Kirschbaum et al., 1994; McGuire
  et al., 1995; Eamus, 1996b). Unless CO<sub>2</sub> stimulates an increase in nitrogen mineralization
  (Curtis et al., 1995; VEMAP Members, 1995), productivity gains in high CO<sub>2</sub> are
  likely to be constrained by the system's nitrogen budget (K�rner, 1995). Increased
  leaf area production is a common CO<sub>2</sub> response; however, nitrogen limitations
  may confine carbon gains to structural tissue rather than leaves (Curtis et
  al., 1995). Thus, in areas receiving large amounts of nitrogen deposition, a
  direct CO<sub>2</sub> response could result in large increases in leaf area, increasing
  transpiration and possibly increasing sensitivity to drought via rapid soil-water
  depletion. Early growth increases may disappear as the system approaches carrying
  capacity as limited by water or nutrients (K�rner, 1995). Shifts in species
  composition will likely result from different sensitivities to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>
  (K�rner, 1995; Bazzaz et al., 1996). </p>
<p>North American forests also are being subjected to numerous other stresses,
  including deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds and tropospheric ozone,
  primarily in eastern North America (Lovett, 1994). The interactions of these
  multiple stresses with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and climate change and with large pest infestations
  (of, for example, the balsam wooly adelgid, gypsy moth, spruce budworm, and
  others) are very difficult to predict; however, many efforts are under way to
  address these questions (Mattson and Haack, 1987; Loehle, 1988; Fajer et al.,
  1989; Taylor et al., 1994; Winner, 1994; Williams and Liebhold, 1995). Anthropogenic
  nitrogen fixation, for example, now far exceeds natural nitrogen fixation (Vitousek,
  1994). Atmospheric nitrogen deposition has likely caused considerable accumulation
  of carbon in the biosphere since the last century (Vitousek, 1994; Townsend
  et al., 1996). However, nitrogen saturation in soils also can be deleterious,
  possibly causing forest dieback in some systems (Foster et al., 1997). Tropospheric
  ozone also can damage trees, causing improper stomatal function, root death,
  membrane leakage, and altered susceptibility to diseases (Manning and Tiedemann,
  1995). Such ozone-induced changes can render trees more sensitive to warming-induced
  drought stress (McLaughlin and Downing, 1995). There are many other stress interactions,
  and researchers think that, in general, multiple stresses will act synergistically,
  accelerating change due to other stresses (Oppenheimer, 1989). </p>
<p>Assessments of possible consequences of climate change rely on linked atmospheric,
  ecological, and economic models. Significant uncertainties are associated with
  each model type, and these uncertainties may amplify as one moves down the line
  of linked models. The model capabilities of GCMs have improved significantly
  from the older (IPCC 1990, WG I, Chapter 3) to the newer (IPCC 1996, WG I, Chapter
  6) scenarios, resulting in somewhat lower estimates of the potential 2xCO<sub>2</sub> climate
  sensitivity and shifting much of the burden of uncertainty to the ecological
  and economic models. Ecological models still carry large uncertainties in the
  simulation of site water balance (among many other issues), particularly with
  respect to the role of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on plant responses to water stress, competition,
  and nutrient limitations. Economic models carry uncertainties with respect to
  future management and technology changes, future per-capita income and available
  capital, GDP, international trade, and how to couple land-use management with
  ecological model output, among others. Ecological and economic models are rapidly
  being enhanced to narrow these uncertainties; improving the linkages between
  the many different model types necessary to permit fully time-dependent simulations
  for integrated regional assessments is an ongoing research need. </p>
