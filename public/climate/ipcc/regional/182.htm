<p><i>Differentiated impacts can occur across North America</i>. As this assessment
  notes, particular areas and sectors within North America are projected to experience
  negative impacts, whereas other areas and sectors could benefit from the projected
  changes. Similarly, because of differences in adaptive capacity within North
  America, different areas and sectors will be better able to respond to climate
  change. </p>
<p><i>Climate change is a dynamic process that will occur over time</i>. Although
  most of the literature on impacts, including the analysis in this assessment,
  has focused on a 2xCO<sub>2</sub> world, it is reasonable to expect that some of the kinds
  of impacts that have been discussed would begin to manifest themselves before
  atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> doubled. It also is important to recognize
  that 2xCO<sub>2</sub> is not a magic concentration; it is likely that, unless action is
  taken, we will pass 2xCO<sub>2</sub> on our way to even higher concentrations. It is not
  unreasonable to suggest that at these higher levels the negative and beneficial
  impacts (e.g., the benefits of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effects on vegetation) could
  be significantly different, even a nonfactor, in a 4xCO<sub>2</sub> world. </p>
<p><i>Many of the changes in climate that currently are being observed are consistent
  with the changes one would expect with greenhouse gas-induced climate change</i>
  (IPCC 1996, WG I, Summary for Policymakers). </p>
<p><i>Many of the actions that might be taken today to address existing stresses
  might also help reduce vulnerability to potential climate change and variability.</i>
  Options include, but are not limited to, actions such as the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve management of water infrastructure, pricing policies, and demand-side
    management of supply to support the competing needs of domestic water supply,
    agriculture, industrial cooling, hydropower, navigation, and fisheries and
    habitat.</li>
  <li>Introduce accommodating adaptation options in the transportation sector,
    as the industry copes with other significant changes, through new technologies,
    markets, and products.</li>
  <li>Introduce effective land-use regulations that also help reduce vulnerabilities
    and direct population shifts away from vulnerable locations such as floodplains,
    steep hillsides, and low-lying coastlines.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Failure to consider climate change when making long-range decisions to manage
  stress response in any sector could increase the risk of taking actions that
  would prove ineffective or even counterproductive in the long run.</i> Examples
  where consideration of climate change could prove prudent are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Actions taken currently that would reduce weather-related deaths associated
    with heat waves in urban areas also could reduce vulnerability to potential
    climate change that might increase the frequency and intensity of heat waves
    (IPCC 1996, WG I, Summary for Policymakers).</li>
  <li>Introducing sustainable water-supply management concepts today, whether
    to deal with shortages or excesses of water, could reduce vulnerability to
    potential climate change. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>The concept of "effective" adaptation by any given sector assumes that those
  affected have the ability and the foresight to discern changing climate trends
  from short-term weather patterns and to make strategic anticipatory adaptations
  accordingly.</i> It is not clear that, if changes in climate and weather patterns
  or variables fall outside people's experience, they will be able to adapt effectively
  in the near term. If they are not able, there may be short-term transitional
  impacts on those individuals and decision makers (e.g., resource managers, farmers,
  fishermen, loggers, or ranchers). </p>
