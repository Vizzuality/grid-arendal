<h4>4.3.1.5. Coral Reefs </h4>
<p>Australia's coral reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, are among the region's
  most sensitive environments to sea-level rise and climate change-through potential
  inundation, flooding, erosion, saline intrusion, bleaching and death of corals,
  and possible changes in tropical cyclone occurrence (some of these issues are
  covered in <a href="081.htm">Section 4.3.4</a>). Climate change impacts will
  be compounded by the rapid growth in environmental stresses arising from existing
  population growth and increasing tourism (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 9.4.3,
  9.4.5). Coral bleaching and algal invasions are sometimes observed on the Great
  Barrier Reef, but the extent to which they are natural or human-induced is unknown.
</p>
<p>Coral bleaching is associated with several factors (including extreme temperatures
  and solar irradiance, subaerial exposure, sedimentation, freshwater dilution,
  contaminants, and diseases) acting singly or in combination (Glynn, 1996). During
  bleaching, corals expel the symbiotic single-celled algae that live within their
  tissues, and then sometimes die (Brown, 1997). This occurs when sea temperatures
  rise more than 2°C above normal, which is often associated with ENSO episodes.
  The frequency of high-temperature episodes will increase as mean temperatures
  gradually rise, which would result in more frequent and widespread damage to
  corals-especially those remote from a reliable supply of larvae of reef species
  or stressed through exposure to local climatic and/or human impacts such as
  riverine runoff (Larcombe et al., 1996), high solar irradiance (especially ultraviolet
  wavelengths) (Glynn, 1996), and pollution (Dubinsky and Stambler, 1996). The
  effects of temperature rise also will depend on latitude, coral height in relation
  to sea level, and the direction and size of the prevailing wave climate. </p>
<p>There is evidence, however, that the temperature changes by themselves may
  be slow enough for the coral reef biota to adapt, through changes in their symbiotic
  partnerships (Brown, 1997) or genetically over a number of generations, as better-adapted
  genotypes settle and survive. At the scale of whole coral reefs and their communities,
  migration to higher latitudes may be a possibility. However, there is a host
  of historical, hydrodynamic, and ecological factors that determine current distributions
  of coral reef biota (Veron, 1995), and it could be centuries before substantial
  changes to species composition and increases in diversity are detected at Australia's
  southernmost coral reefs. </p>
<p>It has been predicted that, by itself, a rise in sea level might benefit many
  reefs because corals on reef tops would have a renewed and/or extended opportunity
  for vertical growth-unlike the last several thousand years, when they have been
  limited by sea level to exclusively horizontal growth (Wilkinson and Buddemeier,
  1994; Wilkinson, 1996). Thus, the potential effect of sea-level rise over the
  next 50 years in tidally limited reef-top coral habitats is an increase in living
  coral cover and, in many cases, an increase in topographic relief. This scenario
  is quite likely to be played out in sheltered parts of many reefs, assuming
  that the majority of these reef-top corals are not killed by increased temperature
  or other causes (such as burial by sediments if high-intensity rainfall events
  were to increase). Although the vertical growth of most shallow corals will
  be able to keep pace with a rate of sea-level rise of up to 5 cm per decade,
  the mechanisms for reef island growth are not expected to keep pace with sea-level
  rise, and therefore many low islands may eventually become uninhabitable (Wilkinson,
  1996; see also <a href="081.htm">Section 4.3.4</a>). </p>
<p>If reef tops do not keep pace with sea-level rise, there could be dramatic
  changes in the reef-top zonation of corals, other biota, and abiotic reef substrata
  because these are strongly controlled by the energy of the waves that pass over
  the reef (Done, 1983). The tendency would be for the plunging point for waves
  to gradually move toward the back of the reef, causing changes in the benthic
  zonation at the new location of the breaker zone and for several meters to tens
  of meters either side. Moreover, any significant change in the frequency or
  magnitude of tropical storms (Suppiah et al., 1996; Henderson-Sellers and Zhang,
  1997; Holland, 1997) would affect both the structure and growth of coral reefs
  (Lough, 1994; Wilkinson, 1996), since individual storms can cause considerable
  damage to reefs, from which it may take a decade or more to recover. </p>
