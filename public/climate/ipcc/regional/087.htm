<h4>4.3.6. Human Health </h4>
<p><i>Summary: Increases are likely in heat stress mortality (particularly in
  Australia), tropical vector-borne diseases such as dengue, and urban pollution-related
  respiratory problems. These impacts are small compared to the total burden of
  ill-health, but they have the potential to cause significant community impact
  and cost. Indigenous communities and economically disadvantaged persons appear
  to be more at risk. Adaptation responses include strengthening existing public
  health infrastructure and meeting the needs of vulnerable groups. A moderate
  degree of vulnerability is apparent with health</i>. </p>
<h4>4.3.6.1. Health Impacts<a name="health"></a> </h4>
<p>Average life expectancy in Australia and New Zealand is relatively high, and
  access to medical care is relatively good by international standards. There
  are considerable inequalities in health status and access to services, however.
  Disadvantaged groups such as indigenous peoples and the poor are likely to be
  most at risk from the effects of climate change. </p>
<p>In parts of urban Australia, the frequency of very hot days (over 40�C) is
  expected to increase by 50-100% for a 2�C increase in mean temperature (Hennessy
  and Pittock, 1995). This is likely to lead to an increase in deaths, especially
  in cities such as Melbourne that are subject to wide variability in temperature,
  but insufficient information is available at present to quantify this impact.
  There may be fewer deaths in winter with warmer temperatures. For example, the
  winter excess in coronary heart disease mortality in Australia and New Zealand
  appears to be related in part to ambient temperature (Enquselassie et al., 1993).
  However, studies in other parts of the world suggest that reduced mortality
  from cold extremes would probably only partly offset the heat stress effect
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 18.2.1). </p>
<p>In both Australia and New Zealand, there are significant food- and waterborne
  diseases that occur more commonly in warmer conditions (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
  18.3.5). For example, in parts of Australia, an amoeba that causes meningoencephalitis
  proliferates in water pipes that are heated in summer as the water travels overland
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 18.3.2). Hotter weather also will exacerbate urban
  air pollution due to photochemical oxidants (Woodward et al., 1995), possibly
  leading in the major cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland) to increased frequency
  of respiratory problems and deaths (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 18.3.5). Australia
  and New Zealand have rates of asthma and other allergic conditions that are
  higher than elsewhere in the Pacific or in many parts of Europe, and these diseases
  may be exacerbated by warmer and more humid climates (Pearce et al., 1993).
</p>
<p>Any increase in extreme events and flooding, including those associated with
  sea-level rise, would increase deaths, injury, infectious diseases, and psychological
  disorders and may increase road accidents. Other waterborne illnesses-such as
  viral, bacterial, and protozoal diarrhoea and cyanobacterial poisoning-would
  be affected by any changes in water availability (due to flooding, droughts,
  and public water shortages). Some disease vectors also are influenced by changes
  in water availability. New Zealand currently is free of human arbovirus infections
  (i.e., viruses borne by arthropods-ticks, mites, etc.), but if temperature and
  rainfall alter it may become susceptible to infections that currently are common
  in Australia (Weinstein et al., 1995). Vectors for dengue and malaria already
  exist in Australia, and southward expansion of the vector populations with temperature
  increases would increase the potential for insect-borne diseases to become more
  widely established. These diseases are very sensitive to climate variability-for
  example, outbreaks of dengue are much more common in the western Pacific islands
  during relatively warm and wet La Ni�a years (Hales et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Conditions forecast under climate change could alter the distribution and proliferation
  of arthropod vectors and/or natural vertebrate hosts. Warmer and wetter conditions
  would lead to increased incidences of insect-borne infections such as Japanese
  Encephalitis virus, Murray Valley Encephalitis virus, Ross River virus, and
  dengue. In southeastern Australia, epidemics of Murray Valley Encephalitis and
  Ross River virus infection follow heavy rain in the Murray-Darling basin (Nicholls,
  1986; IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 18.3.1.7), so additional cases might be expected
  if the frequency or duration of heavy rainfall events increased. However, the
  relationship between climate, vector distribution, and disease are complex.
  For example, although the incidence of infection with Ross River virus may increase
  with increased rainfall, the incidence of symptomatic disease may actually fall
  because individuals who are infected as children remain asymptomatic and are
  immune for life. </p>
<p>The indigenous peoples of Australia and New Zealand-Australian Aborigines,
  Torres Strait Islanders, and Maori-may be more vulnerable to climate change
  because their health status in general is worse than for other Australians (Australian
  Bureau of Statistics, 1997) and other New Zealanders (Pomare et al., 1995).
  These health status differences result largely from social and economic disadvantage,
  which itself is a cause for susceptibility. For example, many Australian Aborigines
  live in remote areas, in poor housing, and are particularly susceptible to infections
  related to deficiencies in water supply and sewage disposal (Moss, 1994). Under
  some scenarios, these conditions could worsen due to higher temperatures, changes
  in rainfall, higher water tables, and rising sea levels. Reduced freshwater
  supply, increased standing water, or both could increase exposure to microbial
  and viral infections and vector-borne diseases (Kolsky, 1993; Hales et al.,
  1995; Henderson et al., 1995; Jacobson and Graham, 1996). </p>
<p>The health impacts of climate change will include economic and social costs.
  These costs are difficult to quantify, but the evidence suggests that the health
  impacts for the region are likely to be relatively small compared to impacts
  from other diseases and sources of mortality. At the same time, it should be
  cautioned that there is considerable uncertainty in our current knowledge of
  not only the likely direct impacts but also the complexities of social responses
  to change and interaction with other sectors. For example, there could be changes
  in the incidence of zoonoses (vertebrate animal-mediated diseases) such as leptospirosis,
  a concern in New Zealand, as farming systems and zoonoses transmission alter
  in response to climate change. Heat stress impacts will be affected by housing
  choices and changing attitudes to air conditioning. More difficult to estimate
  precisely-but possibly of greater importance to public health in the long term-are
  the indirect effects of climate change, such as any adverse social and economic
  effects, especially on vulnerable groups, arising from impacts on other sectors
  and any large population shifts of "environmental refugees" (for example, from
  Pacific atolls) (Moore and Smith, 1996). </p>
<h4>4.3.6.2. Adaptation and Vulnerability<a name="adapt"></a> </h4>
<p>Major adaptation responses include strengthening the existing public health
  infrastructure (such as disease monitoring, vector management, and primary health
  care); improving protective systems where deficiencies are apparent already
  (for example, comprehensive infectious disease surveillance and border quarantine
  controls to reduce introduction of exotic pathogens); and meeting the needs
  of the most vulnerable groups in the population who will be at greatest risk
  from new climate-related threats to health (Woodward, 1996), including through
  improvements in water supply and sewerage systems (Moss, 1994). Adaptations
  to deal with the indirect socioeconomic effects arising in other sectors may
  require significant policy responses at the national and international levels.
