<h4>5.2.2. Climatic Trends in This Century </h4>
<p>Although regional differences are relatively high, most of Europe has experienced
  increases in temperature of about 0.8�C on average in this century (Schoenwiese
  et al., 1993; Brazdil et al., 1996; IPCC 1996, WG I, Chapter 3; Onate and Pou,
  1996; Schuurmans, 1996). The increase has not been continuous throughout the
  century; at most stations, an increase to about 1940 was observed, followed
  by a leveling off or even a decrease until about 1970, and then a renewed warming
  to the present period. These features are most pronounced in middle to high
  latitudes. Some locations in southern Europe exhibit different trends-such as
  in Greece and parts of eastern Europe, where some stations show a cooling trend
  over much of the century (see <a href="305.htm#figureA-2">Figure A-2</a> in <a href="305.htm">Annex
  A</a>). During the most recent decade (1981-1990), warming over most of Europe
  has been exceptionally great, with increases in yearly means of 0.25-0.5�C with
  respect to the long-term average. The warming is most apparent in a belt extending
  from Spain through central Europe into Russia. At some high-elevation sites
  in the Alps, temperature increases have been even more marked, exceeding 1�C
  in the 1980s (Auer and Boehm, 1994; Beniston and Rebetez, 1995). The 1980s have
  exhibited annual temperature anomalies that are systematically in excess of
  the long-term mean (see <a href="305.htm#figureA-7">Figure A-7</a>). Temperature rise
  has been most marked during the winter period (see <a href="#figure5-2">Figure
  5-2</a>); much evidence suggests that minimum temperature increases have been
  far larger than changes in maximum temperatures (e.g., Beniston et al., 1994;
  Brazdil et al., 1996). In other words, the diurnal temperature range is decreasing,
  which is consistent with evidence from other regions of the world (e.g., Karl
  et al., 1993). The geographical distribution of temperature trends emphasizes
  greater warming (2�C per century) in the southWestern part of Europe (Iberian
  Peninsula, south and central France) than in the British Isles or along the
  Baltic coastline (1�C per century). The northern and central parts of European
  Russia also have experienced greater warming than the European average-in some
  places exceeding 3�C per century (see <a href="305.htm#figureA-2">Figure A-2</a>). <br>

  Annual precipitation trends in this century are characterized essentially by
  enhanced precipitation in the nothern half of Europe (i.e., north of the Alps
  to northern Fennoscandia), with increases ranging from 10% to close to 50%.
  The region stretching from the Mediterranean through central Europe into European
  Russia and Ukraine, by contrast, has experienced decreases in precipitation
  by as much as 20% in some areas (see <a href="305.htm#figureA-1">Figure A-1</a>). In
  time-series analyses of precipitation averaged over the European region (see
  <a href="305.htm#figureA-7">Figure A-7</a>), it is difficult to determine a meaningful
  trend in precipitation, especially since the 1950s. The interannual variability
  seems to have decreased in the latter part of the record: The amplitude of departures
  in precipitation from long-term averages is far less than in the first half
  of the century. This pattern does not necessarily mean that the amplitude of
  interannual variability has decreased at the regional scale or at specific sites.
