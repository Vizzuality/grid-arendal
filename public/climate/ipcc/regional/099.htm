<h1>5.3. Key Impacts </h1>
<h4>5.3.1. Ecological Systems<a name="eco"></a> </h4>
<p>Europe has few genuine natural ecosystems. Natural ecosystems generally are
  confined to small areas; agriculture and forestry occupy most soils. Many sites
  with intermediate soils are occupied by seminatural vegetation types. </p>
<p>Vegetation responds to climate change directly and indirectly. Direct effects
  include responses to temperature; indirect effects occur primarily as soil-mediated
  phenomena, such as the influence of precipitation on soil moisture regimes.
  Indirect effects also may occur as a result of the responses of herbivores and
  pests to climate changes, changes in soil fauna, and changes in the frequency
  and severity of disturbances such as fire. In addition, vegetation responds
  directly and indirectly to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The responses are
  species-dependent; no two taxa respond to climatic change in exactly the same
  way (e.g., Stirling et al., 1997). The main response of individual taxa to climatic
  change consists of changes in distribution; adaptive evolutionary changes are
  very rare (Huntley, 1991). At the ecosystem level, the impact of CO<sub>2</sub> on ecosystem
  processes remains very uncertain. Zaller and Arnone (1997) have documented an
  increase in surface-casting earthworm activity in Swiss grasslands exposed to
  610 �l CO<sub>2</sub>/l, but such studies are extremely rare. </p>
<p>In a warmer climate, the pattern of species response will be extremely complex
  within Europe (Grime, 1996) because a variety of temperature and moisture gradients
  exist. Although there is a general temperature gradient from south to north
  and from low to high altitudes, east-west gradients in temperature and precipitation
  also exist; the latter are associated with increasing continentality toward
  central Europe. Further complications arise in the prediction of species responses
  to temperature changes because of the importance of the nature of the change.
  For example, a rise in late-summer temperatures will have different impacts
  than a rise in early-spring temperatures or an average rise in temperatures
  spread evenly throughout the year (Fitter et al., 1995). Similarly, the occurrence
  of late frost may play an important role in restricting the responsiveness of
  small-genome species to mean temperature changes (MacGillivray and Grime, 1995).
  This factor makes the prediction of species responses difficult; a general northward
  shift in species distributions is now recognized as too simplistic a hypothesis.
  Successful migration depends on a number of factors-in particular, the range
  of tolerance of a given plant or tree to heat and moisture stress, environmental
  conditions at the new location, the rate of migration, the presence of competing
  species, and natural and human barriers to migration (Thompson, 1994; Malanson
  and Cairns, 1997). Anthropogenic barriers are especially important for large
  portions of western and central Europe, where land use is dominated by direct
  human intervention. </p>
<p>Short-term experiments suggest that many types of plants will respond positively
  to increases in CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the atmosphere (the so-called CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization
  effect), whereby their photosynthetic rates increase if other factors remain
  constant; this is particularly the case for C<sub>3</sub> plant types and all important
  European crops except maize (Semenov et al., 1996; Wolf et al., 1996). Most
  experiments have been undertaken using isolated plants with optimum nutrient
  supply. Such experimental conditions are relevant to horticultural and agro-industrial
  situations but are inapplicable to natural and seminatural plant communities
  (K�rner, 1996). A wide range of vegetation types may show little or no response
  to increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations under field conditions (K�rner, 1996). The
  responses, however, will be species-specific, especially when other factors
  such as enhanced nitrogen deposition are taken into account (H�ttenschwiler
  and K�rner, 1996a). The net primary productivity of other plants may increase
  (provided that they are not water limited), but there are many uncertainties
  regarding the long-term responses of plants to increased CO<sub>2</sub>; studies around
  natural sources of CO<sub>2</sub> have not revealed any gradients in the growth rates or
  biomass of Mediterranean grassland species (K�rner and Miglietta, 1994). Studies
  of trees growing around natural sources of CO<sub>2</sub> revealed no changes in stomatal
  density, but the guard cells were reduced in size (Miglietta and Raschi, 1993).
  Downy oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) growing close to a CO<sub>2</sub> source had lower
  stomatal conductance than those further away, but Holm oak (Quercus ilex L.)
  showed no such trend (Tognetti et al., 1996). In both species, the osmotic potential
  and apoplasmic fraction of water was elevated close to the CO<sub>2</sub>, indicating that
  these trees were more tolerant of drought conditions (Chaves et al., 1995; Tognetti
  et al., 1996). </p>
<p>There is increasing evidence that traits other than photosynthetic metabolism
  are more important in determining the response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> of different
  species under field conditions (e.g., K�rner, 1993; K�rner et al., 1995; Diaz,
  1995, 1996). For example, increased levels of CO<sub>2</sub> are likely to result in increased
  water-use efficiency in many species. Increased water-use efficiency may help
  many plants and trees resist the extremes of heat and drought that may occur
  more frequently in southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. </p>
<p>Studies of model ecosystems exposed to enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen deposition
  suggest the presence of nonlinear system-level adjustments (H�ttenschwiler and
  K�rner, 1996b). These adjustments include physiological down-regulation of photosynthesis
  at the leaf level, reduced leaf area index, and increasing strength of below-ground
  carbon sinks. At the same time, no aboveground growth stimulation was observed.
  Changes were observed between CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of 280 and 420 �l/l; major
  changes in coniferous forest ecosystems may be underway already in response
  to increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. </p>
<p>The impact of climate change on biodiversity and the composition of ecosystems
  in Europe is extremely difficult to predict. A great deal depends on the impacts
  on ecosystem processes, such as the rates and magnitudes of disturbance. The
  resilience of many ecosystems to change also is very uncertain; many Norway
  spruce forests, for example, are likely to persist for several hundred years
  in the absence of any major disturbance (Sykes and Prentice, 1996). This inertia,
  along with the possibility of species acclimation to changed environmental conditions
  (Kellom�ki and Wang, 1996), may delay the onset of many changes in natural ecosystems
  (Woodward, 1993). Models that currently are available for predicting such changes
  generally are restricted to the most important components of vegetation (e.g.,
  trees in forests); little research has been done on possible future interactions
  between these and other ecosystem components under changed climatic and CO<sub>2</sub>
  conditions. The models suggest that in some cases, species arrivals may compensate
  for species losses, whereas in others, human-induced changes in land use may
  delay the arrival of new species, causing a reduction in diversity. Consequently,
  there is a need to combine models that simulate changes in species distributions
  with models developed to look at species turnover at specific sites (compare
  van der Maarel and Sykes, 1993; �kland, 1995a,b; Fr�borg and Eriksson, 1997).
