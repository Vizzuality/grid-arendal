<h4>6.2.4. Climate Change </h4>
<p><a href="306.htm">Annex
  B</a> of this report provides information on the progress
  made with transient runs of atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs),
  which allow-within certain limits and with reliable complementary data-climate
  projections at a regional scale. <a href="306.htm">Annex
  B</a> also provides
  information on different regionalization techniques, which recently have been
  developed and tested to improve the coarse resolution in regional climate change
  simulation. However, the regions identified for this type of simulation do not
  include Latin America. </p>
<p>Whetton et al. (1996) analyzed the performance of models in South America to
  assess the ability of GCMs to reproduce key climate features of the Southern
  Hemisphere, as well as the major gaps in their simulation capability. The authors
  considered several "mixed-layer ocean" experiments and several "coupled" or
  "full dynamic ocean" experiments. The correlation between modeled and observed
  annual mean precipitation over the region ranges from 0.35 to 0.70 in mixed-layer
  GCM runs; slightly higher correlations are found in coupled GCM climate experiments.
</p>
<p>In greenhouse climate experiments performed over South America and adjacent
  oceans (Labraga, 1997; Labraga and Lopez, 1997), mean temperature increases
  simulated in mixed-layer equilibrium experiments ranged between 1.5�C and 4.0�C
  at the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling; transient experiments with coupled GCMs simulated
  mean temperature increases of 1.2-1.7�C. According to the results of five coupled
  GCMs, temperatures in the semi-arid zone of central Chile and central-western
  Argentina during the Southern Hemisphere summer are simulated to increase by
  1-3�C at the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling. During the same season, precipitation in
  the area was projected to decrease by 10-15% per degree of global warming, according
  to the same set of experiments. There is consensus among models that the semi-arid
  subtropical zone will experience intensified and extended dry conditions. In
  addition, the coupled GCMs all project increases in rainfall in the ITCZ in
  the eastern equatorial Pacific and the northWestern part of the continent, the
  South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) in the eastern part of Brazil and the
  adjacent Atlantic Ocean, and the southern tip of the continent. <br>

  Because of the great climatic diversity of this region and the present limitations
  of GCMs in simulating Latin America's regional climate, many studies that have
  estimated vulnerability have used the GCMs as tools for obtaining reference
  scenarios, in order to perform sensitivity analyses (e.g., for different crops
  at specific sites and water resources for specific basins). These analyses have
  included detailed knowledge of the local climate founded on sufficient and reliable
  real data and correctly evaluated proxy data. A good example of this approach
  appears in a study on "Global Warming and Climate Change in Mexico" (Liverman
  and O'Brien, 1991), in which the authors note the importance of acknowledging
  differences among climate model projections-as well as between model simulations
  and observed climates-because these differences underscore the uncertainties
  involved in assessing the regional impacts of global warming. A range of possible
  outcomes is captured by using the results of different GCMs and undertaking
  a sensitivity analysis of the results. Some of the conclusions reached appear
  in the relevant sections of this chapter, which also provide information on
  the vulnerabilities of and potential impacts on natural and managed systems
  and human health in Latin America as a result of global warming. In this context,
  it is very important to realize that climate change is only one among many causes
  leading to the changes that have been observed in these systems during recent
  decades. In fact, many factors-such as limited access to technology, poor research
  capacity, economic crises, social inequality, and population growth-could give
  rise to larger effects than those stemming from atmospheric warming. </p>
