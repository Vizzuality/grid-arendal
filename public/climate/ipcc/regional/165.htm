<h4>7.3.4.2. Land Degradation and Other Environmental Problems Affecting Food
  and Fiber Production </h4>
<p>Land degradation and desertification are major problems that are caused by
  natural factors (e.g., prolonged droughts) and by human activities-particularly
  overgrazing, uncontrolled cultivation, fuelwood gathering, inappropriate use
  of irrigation, uncontrolled urbanization, and tourism development (Kharin, 1995;
  IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 2; Schreiber and Shermuchamedov, 1996; UNEP, 1997).
  Urbanization and related activities (e.g., road construction) have resulted
  in losses of permanent pasture and increases in the agricultural use of marginal
  lands, leading to further degradation (UNEP, 1997). Dryland salinity and waterlogging,
  especially in low-lying countries in the Middle East and parts of central Asia
  (e.g., around the Aral Sea), also are contributing to land degradation (Kharin,
  1997; UNEP, 1997). </p>
<p>The full extent of land degradation in the region is not known, although an
  estimated 10% of the arid and semi-arid land is classified as having some soil
  constraints (see <a href="156.htm#table7-1">Table 7-1</a>). Future erosion risk
  is more likely to be influenced by increases in population density, intensive
  cultivation of marginal lands, and the use of resource-based and subsistence
  farming techniques than by changes in climate (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 4).
</p>
<p>Various options are available for reducing soil degradation by improving the
  carbon and water storage capacity of the soil (see below). Unfortunately, because
  of low surface-water availability, some of these practices might not be helpful
  for all of the countries in the region. However, other soil conservation and
  soil protection measures can be implemented in these areas. </p>
<p><i>Agro-ecosystems</i>. Water availability is the main determinant of productivity;
  the use of reduced tillage and mulching to increase available water and reduce
  surface erosion can promote increased soil carbon. In areas where cropping and
  livestock are closely integrated, more-efficient use of manure and commercial
  fertilizer also can increase productivity and soil carbon. In temperate parts
  of the region, eliminating or reducing summer fallow through better water management
  in nonirrigated areas could significantly increase carbon and decrease soil
  erosion in semi-arid croplands (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 23.2.2). </p>
<p><i>Reduction in animal density</i>. In much of the semi-arid area, the predominant
  land use is pastoral, and grazing control is an important option for the maintenance
  of soil carbon. Reduction in animal numbers can increase carbon storage by enhancing
  plant cover. This practice can have a positive effect on the ecosystem if there
  is sufficient rainfall, but reductions in animal numbers on rangelands may require
  alternative sources of food for humans-and thus changes in national or regional
  food production policies. </p>
<p><i>Changing animal distribution</i>. Changing animal distribution through salt
  placement, development of water sources, or fencing can lead to the more even
  use of pastures and consequently to increases in overall plant cover, improved
  status of the root system (as a consequence of less-intense grazing), and increased
  carbon sequestration. Appropriate animal-management practices will be specific
  to local and regional production systems; for example, fencing or salt placement
  may not be useful in herding systems and may interfere with wildlife migration.
</p>
<p><i>Watershed-scale projects</i>. Practices involving the development of dams 
  with large-scale water-storage capacity may increase long-term carbon storage 
  by improving animal management and food production systems. Such projects are 
  expensive, however, and they can result in social and cultural dislocation, 
  local extinctions of wildlife, and increases in human and animal population 
  density. Because 6-89% of the region's cropland area already is irrigated (see 
  <a href="d5-a.htm">Table D-5</a>), watershed management with additions of dams 
  may not be a suitable response. </p>
