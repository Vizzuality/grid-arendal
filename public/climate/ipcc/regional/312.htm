<h1>B.4. Simulations using Statistical Downscaling and Regional Climate Modeling
  Systems</h1>
<p>Although computing power has substantially increased during the last few years,
  the horizontal resolution of present coupled GCMs is still too coarse to capture
  the effects of local and regional forcings in areas of complex surface physiography
  and to provide information suitable for many impact assessment studies. Since
  IPCC (1992), significant progress has been achieved in the development and testing
  of statistical downscaling and regional modeling techniques for the generation
  of high-resolution regional climate information from coarse-resolution GCM simulations.
</p>
<h4>B.4.1. Statistical Downscaling <a name="b41"></a></h4>
<p>Statistical downscaling is a two-step process basically consisting of i) development
  of statistical relationships between local climate variables (e.g., surface
  air temperature and precipitation) and large-scale predictors, and ii) application
  of such relationships to the output of GCM experiments to simulate local climate
  characteristics. A range of statistical downscaling models have been developed
  (IPCC 1996, WG I), mostly for U.S., European, and Japanese locations where better
  data for model calibration are available. The main progress achieved in the
  last few years has been the extension of many downscaling models from monthly
  and seasonal to daily time scales, which allows the production of data more
  suitable for a broader set of impact assessment models (e.g., agriculture or
  hydrologic models). </p>
<p>When optimally calibrated, statistical downscaling models have been quite successful
  in reproducing different statistics of local surface climatology (IPCC 1996,
  WG I). Limited applications of statistical downscaling models to the generation
  of climate change scenarios has occurred showing that in complex physiographic
  settings local temperature and precipitation change scenarios generated using
  downscaling methods were significantly different from, and had a finer spatial
  scale structure than, those directly interpolated from the driving GCMs (IPCC
  1996, WG I). </p>
<h4>B.4.2. Regional Modeling<a name="b42"></a> </h4>
<p>The (one-way) nested modeling technique has been increasingly applied to climate
  change studies in the last few years. This technique consists of using output
  from GCM simulations to provide initial and driving lateral meteorological boundary
  conditions for high-resolution Regional Climate Model (RegCM) simulations, with
  no feedback from the RegCM to the driving GCM. Hence, a regional increase in
  resolution can be attained through the use of nested RegCMs to account for sub-GCM
  grid-scale forcings. The most relevant advance in nested regional climate modeling
  activities was the production of continuous RegCM multi-year climate simulations.
  Previous regional climate change scenarios were mostly produced using samples
  of month-long simulations (IPCC 1996, WG I). The primary improvement represented
  by continuous long-term simulations consists of equilibration of model climate
  with surface hydrology and simulation of the full seasonal cycle for use in
  impact models. In addition, the capability of producing long-term runs facilitates
  the coupling of RegCMs to other regional process models, such as lake models,
  dynamical sea ice models, and possibly regional ocean (or coastal) and ecosystem
  models. </p>
<p>Continuous month- or season-long to multi-year experiments for present-day
  conditions with RegCMs driven either by analyses of observations or by GCMs
  were generated for regions in North America, Asia, Europe, Australia, and Africa.
  Equilibrium regional climate change scenarios due to doubled CO<sub>2</sub> concentration
  were produced for the continental U.S., Tasmania, Eastern Asia, and Europe.
  None of these experiments included the effects of atmospheric aerosols. </p>
<p>In the experiments mentioned above, the model horizontal grid point spacing
  varied in the range of 15 to 125 km and the length of runs from 1 month to 10
  years. The main results of the validation and present-day climate experiments
  with RegCMs can be summarized in the following points: </p>
<ul>
  <li>When driven by analyses of observations, RegCMs simulated realistic structure
    and evolution of synoptic events. Averaged over regions on the order of 10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>6</sup>
    km<sup>2</sup> in size, temperature biases were mostly in the range of a few
    tenths of �C to a few �C, and precipitation biases were mostly in the range
    of 10-40% of observed values. The biases generally increased as the size of
    the region decreased.</li>
  <li>The RegCM performance was critically affected by the quality of the driving
    large-scale fields, and tended to deteriorate when the models were driven
    by GCM output, mostly because of the poorer quality of the driving large-scale
    data compared to the analysis data (e.g., position and intensity of storm
    tracks). </li>
  <li>Compared to the driving GCMs, RegCMs generally produced more realistic regional
    detail of surface climate as forced by topography, large lake systems, or
    narrow land masses. However, the validation experiments also showed that RegCMs
    can both improve and degrade aspects of regional climate compared to the driving
    GCM runs, especially when regionally averaged.</li>
  <li>Overall, the models performed better at mid-latitudes than in tropical regions.</li>
  <li>The RegCM performance improved as the resolution of the driving GCM increased,
    mostly because the GCM simulation of large-scale circulation patterns improved
    with increasing resolution.</li>
  <li>Seasonal as well as diurnal temperature ranges were simulated reasonably
    well.</li>
  <li>An important problem in the validation of RegCMs has been the lack of adequately
    dense observational data, since RegCMs can capture fine structure of climate
    patterns. This problem is especially relevant in mountainous areas, where
    only a relatively small number of high-elevation stations are often available.</li>
</ul>
<p>When applied to the production of climate change scenarios, nested model experiments
  showed the following (IPCC 1996, WG I): </p>
<ul>
  <li>For temperature, the differences between RegCM- and GCM-simulated region-averaged
    change scenarios were in the range of 0.1 to 1.4�C. For precipitation, the
    differences between RegCM and GCM scenarios were more pronounced than for
    temperature, in some instances by one order of magnitude or even in sign.
    These differences between RegCM- and GCM-produced regional scenarios are due
    to the combined contributions of the different resolution of surface forcing
    (e.g., topography, lakes, coastlines) and atmospheric circulations, and in
    some instances the different behavior of model parameterizations designed
    for the fine- and coarse-resolution models. In summer, differences between
    RegCM and GCM results were generally more marked than in winter due to the
    greater importance of local processes.</li>
  <li>While the simulated temperature changes obtained with nested models were
    generally larger than the corresponding biases, the precipitation changes
    were generally of the same order of, or smaller than, the precipitation biases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, of relevance for the simulation of regional climate change is the
  development of a variable-resolution global model technique, whereby the model
  resolution gradually increases over the region of interest. </p>
