<h4>3.3.5. Fisheries </h4>
<p>The basic limiting factors for fish production in polar and subpolar regions
  are light and temperature. Warming in high latitudes should lead to longer growing
  periods, increased growth rates, and ultimately, perhaps, increases in the general
  productivity of these regions (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 16.2.2.2). On the other
  hand, the probability of nutrient loss resulting from reduced deep-water exchange
  could result in reduced productivity in the long term. Again, this complexity
  highlights the importance of changes in temperature for patterns of circulation.
  Global warming could have especially strong impacts on the regions of oceanic
  subpolar fronts, where temperature increases in deep water could lead to a substantial
  redistribution of pelagic and benthic communities, including commercially important
  fish species (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 8.3.2). </p>
<p>In polar regions, the number of dominant fish species is small; many species
  of low abundance are typical of tropical regions, with the exception of upwelling
  areas. Only 15-20 commercially important species in the Arctic or Antarctic
  Oceans are recorded, whereas the numbers increase to about 50 and 16-450 in
  the boreal and tropic areas, respectively (Laevastu, et al., 1996). The poleward
  distribution of fish due to climate warming generally expands fishing areas.
  This expansion might produce better yields of fish production. In the higher
  latitudes, however, spawning grounds of cold-water species that are very sensitive
  to the temperature change might be destroyed by changes in water properties.
</p>
<p>In some cases, fisheries on the margin of profitability could prosper or decline.
  For example, if there is a retreat of sea ice in Antarctica, the krill fishery-which
  is regulated by the current ice-free period-could become more attractive to
  nations not already involved (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 16.2.2.3). Fishery statistics
  may be more valuable for the analyses of interannual and long-term fluctuations
  of marine populations than was previously thought. Time series of catch-per-unit-effort
  (CPUE) statistics from the commercial krill fishery operating around South Georgia
  during 1973-1993 have been used for considering the hypothesis that fluctuations
  in the abundance of krill in the Scotia Sea area are related to environmental
  changes. A consistent correlation has been found between the various CPUE indices
  and ice-edge positions: The further south the ice-edge occurred during the winter-spring
  season, the lower the CPUE values in the following fishing season. The most
  extreme expression of this relationship was the lack of a krill fishery in 1978
  and 1984, when the ice did not extend far north during the previous winter.
  By contrast, in 1978 and 1984 the March ice-edge reached its northern limit
  at 50ï¿½S, preceding high CPUE values in 1979 and 1985. A consistent relationship
  also exists between CPUE and water temperature. Warm-water temperature in the
  South Georgia shelf area in January-February corresponded to lower CPUE values
  in the same year. There also is significant correlation between air transport
  in late spring and CPUE in the next year. For example, a prevalence of southerly
  meridional air transport precedes high CPUE values (Fedoulov et al., 1996).
  It must be emphasized, however, that the physical regimes of the sub-Antarctic
  region in the vicinity of South Georgia are very complicated, and this model
  may not be applicable to the entire Antarctic. </p>
<p>Fedoulov et al. (1996) proposed the following mechanism as a hypothesis to
  explain how ice, ocean, and atmospheric components of the Southern Ocean affect
  krill distribution. Krill usually are more abundant in the southern Scotia Sea
  along the Weddell Scotia Confluence (WSC), so it is likely that the currents
  play a key role in krill transport to South Georgia from the Antarctic Peninsula.
  The WSC zone extends northward in the eastern Scotia Sea, and this colder water
  penetrates along the southeastern shelf of South Georgia. The position of the
  WSC is thought to be determined by the intensity of the Weddell gyre, which
  in turn is driven by the formation of dense and cold Weddell water. The main
  factor in the creation of the cold Weddell water is increased salinity resulting
  from ice formation. Hence, the dominance of a warm or cold year reflects the
  intensity of the Weddell gyre and consequently the general position of the WSC.
  It is reasonable to suppose that ice can start to influence krill distribution
  when it is close to or covers the area of the WSC. Ice cover modifies the mechanism
  of drift current formation and creates favorable (northern ice-edge position)
  or unfavorable (southern ice-edge position) conditions for krill transport to
  South Georgia. </p>
<p>In a recent study, Loeb et al. (1997) are documenting a more complex relationship
  between krill and salpa, a pelagic tunicate. In essence, extensive seasonal
  ice cover promotes early krill spawning, inhibits population blooms of pelagic
  salps, and favors the survival of krill larvae through their first winter. Salpa
  blooms affect adult krill reproduction and the survival of krill larvae. If
  a decrease in the frequency of winters with extensive sea-ice development accompanies
  the warming trend in the Antarctic Peninsula area, the frequency of krill recruitment
  failures would be expected to increase, and the krill population would decline.
  An increase in salpa blooms would further depress krill numbers. This codependency
  of competing species on changing climate variables has implications for the
  management of the krill fishery and for populations of vertebrate predators
  such as penguins, fish, and whales, which depend on krill. </p>
<h4>3.3.6. Agriculture<a name="agriculture"></a> </h4>
Agriculture in polar lands is severely limited by the harsh climate. Although
agriculture is not practiced in Antarctica, some agriculture currently takes place
in the Arctic. If temperature were to increase and result in earlier last-freeze
dates and later first-frost dates, conditions for Arctic agriculture should become
more favorable, although climate conditions will still make agriculture in the
Arctic extremely difficult. There already are indications in Alaska, based on
the last 70 years, for an increase in the length of the growing season (Sharratt,
1992). Although considerably more land will be available for farming if temperatures
increase, moisture and nutrient problems will limit the productivity of these
areas (Mills, 1994). The more immediate effects are likely to be on plants such
as cotton grass that are important to caribou and reindeer populations (Kuropat,
1984).
