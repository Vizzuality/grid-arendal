<h4>5.3.1.5. Littoral and Pelagic Zones </h4>
<p>Littoral and pelagic zones often are forgotten in studies of climate change
  impacts. However, important changes have already been observed (e.g., a significant
  increase in average temperatures of the waters in the western Mediterranean
  basin over the past 20-30 years) (Francour et al., 1994). Temperature changes
  are reflected in substantial changes in the relative abundance of thermophilic
  species; there have been increased catches of thermophilic fish species such
  as <i>Diplodus cervinus, Epinephus marginatus, Pomadasys incisus, Sphyraena
  sphyraena, Balistes carolinensis, Sardinella aurita, and Pomatomus saltatrix</i>.
</p>
<h4>5.3.1.6. Adaptation Options<a name="adapt"></a> </h4>
<p>Natural ecosystems may adapt to climatic change in one way or another-but not
  necessarily in ways preferred by humans. Therefore, some kind of human intervention,
  in the form of management, may be necessary. Adaptation options for forests
  and plants could include the creation of refugia; migration corridors and/or
  assisted migration; and improvements in integrated fire-, pest-, and disease-management
  techniques. This approach poses problems in many parts of Europe, where ecosystems
  have been so fragmented and the population density is so high that some of these
  options may be impossible to implement. Reforestation would be a viable adaptation
  option in some cases, as would afforestation of abandoned agricultural land-increasing
  habitats and establishing corridors between fragmented nature reserves. For
  wetlands and peatlands, reducing the impacts of climate change could be achieved
  through wetland restoration or creation techniques; in boreal regions where
  permafrost is a major feature of wetland ecosystems, however, such techniques
  would not be of much use. Freshwater biological systems can be assisted in a
  number of ways that could help mitigate the impacts of climate change, particularly
  through the increase and protection of riparian vegetation and the restoration
  of river and stream channels to their natural, adaptive morphologies. Such restoration
  processes may take several decades. </p>
<p>For all ecological systems, the reduction of pollution and land-use stresses
  in more heavily populated regions of Europe would contribute to removing major
  stress factors. In some circumstances, this strategy might allow plants to adjust
  more easily to the negative effects of climatic change. </p>
<p>An increasingly determined effort toward protection and revitalization of freshwater
  ecosystems in developed countries already has shown positive achievements, particularly
  through improvements in the water quality of watersheds. The protection of threatened
  aquatic habitats such as wetlands has facilitated the reintroduction of several
  endangered vertebrate species. This has been the case particularly in central
  Europe as a consequence of increased awareness of environmental problems. </p>
<h4>5.3.2. Agriculture and Fisheries<a name="agri"></a> </h4>
<p>The impacts of climate change on agriculture can be defined at different scales-including
  crop yield, farm or sector profitability, regional economic activity, or hunger
  vulnerability. Impacts depend on biophysical and socioeconomic responses. </p>
<p>In the past decade, substantial amounts of research have focused on regional
  and national assessments of the potential effects of climate change on agriculture.
  Relatively little work, however, has included systematic assessments that identify
  vulnerable socioeconomic groups, integrate effects across sectors, describe
  impacts at different spatial and temporal scales, or address the efficacy of
  the range of practical responses (see Parry et al., 1992). For the most part,
  studies have treated each region or nation in isolation (see IPCC, 1996, for
  a complete reference list of studies to date; see also Sirotenko et al., 1997),
  without regard to changes in production in other places, and have not addressed
  in an integrated way interactions with other related systems (e.g., water resources,
  socioeconomy, policy). Global assessments of climate change impacts in agriculture
  and agricultural markets have been few to date (Parry et al., 1988; Smit, 1989;
  Martin et al., 1990; Kane et al., 1992; Rosenberg and Crosson, 1991; UK Department
  of the Environment, 1991; Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994; Darwin et al., 1995).
  In addition, a major shortcoming of most climate impact assessments has been
  their lack of in-depth treatment of adaptation, in part because of its complexity
  and in part because of the lack of a suitable methodological framework. </p>
