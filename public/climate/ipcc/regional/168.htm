<h4>7.3.7. Human Health </h4>
<ul>
  <li><i>Human health in the region is variable, reflecting the economies of the
    different countries. In countries where poverty is prevalent, infant mortality
    rates are high and life expectancies are low. The population of the region
    is increasing by 2.7% per year; this trend may affect human health (e.g.,
    through the spread of waterborne diseases associated with high population
    densities). The impacts of climate change are likely to be detrimental to
    the health of the population, mainly through heat stress and possible increases
    in vector-borne (e.g., dengue fever and malaria) and waterborne diseases.
    Decreases in water availability and food production (especially if there is
    a shortage of water for irrigation) would indirectly affect the health of
    the population. </i></li>
</ul>
<p>Human health in the region is variable, reflecting the economies of the different
  countries. The proportion of a population living in absolute poverty is considered
  to be an indication of human health. Nearly half of the developing world's poor-and
  nearly half of those in extreme poverty-live in south Asia; the next-largest
  numbers are (in order) in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and north Africa
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 12.2.1.3). Estimates of rural poverty are available
  for nine countries of this region; they range from 6% (Oman) to 60% (Afghanistan).
  Access to safe drinking water in urban areas varies from 39% in Afghanistan
  to almost 100% in 13 countries in the region; in rural areas, the equivalent
  figures are 5% in Afghanistan to almost 100% in several countries (WRI, 1996).
  Because a high percentage of the population lives in urban areas, a high proportion
  of the population has access to safe drinking water, which diminishes the risk
  of waterborne infectious diseases. </p>
<p>Infant mortality rates and the prevalence of infectious diseases also are considered
  to be indicators of human health (WRI, 1996). Figures for infant mortality for
  1970-75 varied between 23 deaths per 1,000 live births (Israel) to 194 deaths
  per 1,000 live births (Afghanistan), with a mean of 94 (the world average was
  93). The equivalent figures for 1990-1995 varied from 9 to 163 (for the same
  countries), with a mean of 50 (the world average is 64). These statistics suggest
  that the health of the population has improved since the 1970s, in part as a
  result of better primary health care (Bener et al., 1993). During 1990-95, life
  expectancy varied between 43.5 years (Afghanistan) and 76.5 years (Israel),
  with a mean of 66.6 (compared with the world average of 52.8). </p>
<p>Generally, the health of the population in the region has been improving faster
  than the world average-with a few exceptions related to civil unrest (e.g.,
  Afghanistan). Given the natural wealth, in terms of petroleum deposits, of many
  countries in the region, this trend should continue in the near future. However,
  political tensions remain high in parts of the region, and much of the region
  is subject to major earthquakes; both of these factors could cause major setbacks
  in public health. </p>
<p>The population of the region is increasing by an average of 2.7% annually;
  as the population increases, air pollution, waste management, and sanitation
  will become important issues. Given global trends, there may be an increase
  in motor vehicle ownership, which is likely to add to the problem of air pollution.
  Photochemical smog produced by the reaction of sunlight with ozone and photochemical
  oxidants-such as peroxyacetal nitrate (PAN) from nitrogen oxides (NOx) and hydrocarbon
  emissions-is particularly prevalent in cities in semi-arid regions with a high
  density of industrial pollution-producing industries (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
  12.3.3). This smog may lead to respiratory problems in the urban populations.
</p>
<p>Climate change will have direct impacts (e.g., through heat stress) as well
  as indirect effects (e.g., through reductions in food, leading to poor nutrition
  and increased susceptibility to diseases) on human health. The overall impact
  of climate change on human societies will vary, depending on many factors-such
  as the amount of low-lying or arid land they occupy and their degree of dependence
  on agriculture or aquatic resources (IPCC 1996, WG III, Section 2.2.3). </p>
<p>Climate change is projected to increase the frequency of very hot days. Extensive
  research has shown that heat waves cause excess deaths (Larsen, 1990; McMichael
  et al., 1996). Recent analyses of concurrent meteorological and mortality data
  in cities in the Middle East provide evidence that overall death rates rise
  during heat waves, particularly when the temperature rises above the local population's
  threshold value. Therefore, it can be predicted that climate change would cause
  additional heat-related deaths and illnesses in the region via increased exposure
  to heat waves (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 18.2.1). </p>
<p>In some areas-especially where access to safe drinking water is poor-waterborne
  gastrointestinal diseases related to fecal contamination (e.g., Giardiasis,
  diarrhea) are a problem. Such diseases often lead to high infant mortality in
  Saudi Arabia (Jarallah et al., 1993; Altukhi et al., 1996); Afghanistan, Jordan,
  and Pakistan (Azim and Rahaman, 1993; Nazer et al., 1993; Chavasse et al., 1996);
  and Turkey. Waterborne diseases also occur in tourist resorts (Kocasoy, 1995)
  in Israel (Lowenthal, 1993), Tajikistan (World Bank, 1995b), and Turkmenistan
  (World Bank, 1995c). Some countries of the region have made efforts to control
  these diseases through various programs-some implemented in the early 1970s.
  If flooding occurs as a result of more intense rainfall events, waterborne diseases
  may become frequent, mostly because of the overloading of sewage systems (McMichael,
  1997). </p>
