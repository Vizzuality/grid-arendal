<h4>2.1.2. People and Natural Resources</h4>
<p>The population of Africa is approximately 650 million (World Bank, 1995b).
  About two-thirds of the population lives in rural areas and derives its main
  income from agriculture. In some countries-such as Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi,
  and Uganda-rural population makes up more than 80% of the total. Agriculture
  is the fundamental economic activity in these countries; although it accounts
  on average for only about 20-30% of GDP, agriculture contributes the largest
  share of total exports (Cleaver and Schreiber, 1994). </p>
<p>Cultivated land per capita varies considerably across the continent, reflecting
  the uneven distribution of population (for example, low density in the Congo
  basin but high in the east African Highlands) as well as low levels of technology
  and the unsuitability of wide areas for farming. Dependence on shifting cultivation
  makes the area needed for cropland high. Scarcity of good land, coupled with
  soil degradation and low levels of inputs and technology, results in increasing
  deficits in food production. The predominance of rain-fed subsistence agriculture
  and, across southern Africa, overdependence on (water-demanding) maize has helped
  ensure that food security for most of the continent is inextricably linked to
  the quality of each rainy season. In dryland regions, crop and livestock production
  are extremely susceptible to seasonal rainfall variability and, as a result,
  have shown considerable volatility in recent years. Drought shock, however,
  extends well beyond the confines of agriculture (crop) and livestock production,
  partly because of the important roles these two sectors play in the overall
  economies of many African states. Crop and livestock production are major employers
  and make significant contributions to GDP and export earnings. They also are
  major sources of raw materials for industries such as textiles, food processing,
  and fuel refining. On the other hand, they are major markets for other industries
  such as machinery, animal feeds, fuel, and fertilizer producers (Gibberd et
  al., 1996). </p>
<p>Of the 30 poorest countries of the world, 22 are African (World Bank, 1996).
  The average income level in sub-Saharan Africa in 1993 was $520 per capita,
  and the average growth rate per capita was negative (-0.8% per year from 1980
  to 1993). By the year 2000, the number of poor in Africa is projected to increase
  to an estimated 265 million-which would represent more than 40% of the continent's
  population (World Bank, 1990). In Africa, poverty is linked to the environment
  in complex ways, particularly in economies that are based on exploitation of
  natural resources. Degradation of these resources reduces the productivity of
  poor persons, who most rely on them, and makes poor communities even more susceptible
  to extreme events (whether meteorological, economic, or political in origin)
  (World Bank, 1996). Poverty is exacerbated by a demographic profile that continues
  to record an annual population growth rate of just under 3%, the highest in
  the world (WRI, 1994). As a result, the population in many African countries
  will continue to double every 20 to 30 years, well into the 21st century. However,
  the high incidence of incurable diseases-such as malaria, human immunodeficiency
  virus (HIV), and hepatitis B-may modify this estimate. </p>
