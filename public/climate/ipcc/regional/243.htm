<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Small island states may comprise a single island (e.g., Barbados, Malta, and
  Nauru); a few islands, such as Tuvalu (9 islands), Vanuatu (12), and Cape Verde
  (15); or numerous islands-for instance, the Seychelles (115), Tonga (180), and
  the Maldives (1,200). Physiographically and geologically, island states may
  comprise low oceanic islands, including atolls and reef islands; high volcanic
  or limestone islands; or continental islands (Nunn, 1994). In the first group
  of islands, species diversity and endemism often are low. In the second group,
  species diversity may be high or low, but endemism usually is high. Continental
  islands-particularly those located on the broad shelves of neighboring land
  masses-tend to have high species diversity and low endemism, which are functions
  of their continental proximity. </p>
<p>The ecology of small islands generally is characterized by a limited range
  of terrestrial and coastal ecosystems, surrounded by a vast expanse of ocean.
  Vegetation usually consists of groups of easily dispersed species, which have
  a tendency to be restricted in their distribution. Forests (including strands
  and mangroves), coral reefs, and sea grass communities provide a range of food
  and other resources. Biodiversity is highly variable and depends on a combination
  of physical and other factors (e.g., location, area, geology). For example,
  because of the coralline nature of most low-lying atolls, soils usually are
  poorly developed, exhibit immature profiles, are highly alkaline and usually
  deficient in nutrients, and have low water-retention capacity. </p>
<p>To the extent that island species are restricted in range and distribution, 
  they are potentially more endangered and prone to extinction than the flora 
  and fauna of continental land masses. Communities of terrestrial fauna on small 
  islands are poorly developed and include few indigenous land mammals. Avian 
  fauna are dominated mainly by migratory sea birds, with a relatively small number 
  of indigenous species (<a href="d7-a.htm">Table D-7</a>), representing a limited 
  number of families. </p>
<p>The economies of small island states are sensitive to external market forces
  over which they have little control. The economies generally are dominated by
  agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and international transport activities (air
  and sea). On some islands, remittances from expatriate nationals are an important
  component of family income. In the case of Tuvalu, remittances mainly from workers
  in the phosphate mines in Nauru, seamen, and contract workers in New Zealand
  exceed by far export earnings (SPREP, 1996). Primary production also is an important
  source of export earnings for many islands; important products include sugar
  (Barbados, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Mauritius), bananas (Dominica, St.
  Lucia, Tonga), copra (Cook Islands, Palau, Seychelles, Vanuatu), forestry (Solomon
  Islands), and mining (Cuba, Cyprus, Jamaica, Nauru). Subsistence agriculture
  also is an important economic activity, providing some level of food security
  and saving valuable foreign exchange that otherwise would be spent on food and
  other imports. Tourism also is an important foreign exchange earner in many
  small island states. </p>
<p>Infrastructure and services often are not well developed and frequently are
  concentrated in areas of high population density; on some islands, however,
  infrastructure for services and tourism is well developed. In most island states,
  the greatest concentration of people tends to occur in the capital city or on
  the capital island-where, in some cases, more than 50% of the country's total
  population lives. Nevertheless, in many cases (e.g., Pacific island communities),
  there are strong traditional and cultural ties to the home island, village,
  or rural area; there also may be strong religious links, which may have an important
  influence on perceptions of and attitudes toward climate change and sea-level
  rise (McLean and d'Aubert, 1993). </p>
<p>Some low-lying small island states-such as the atoll nations of the Pacific
  and Indian Oceans-are among the most vulnerable to climate change, seasonal-to-interannual
  climate variability, and sea-level rise. Much of their critical infrastructure
  and many socioeconomic activities tend to be located along the coastline, in
  many cases at or close to present sea level (Nurse, 1992; Pernetta, 1992; Hay
  and Kaluwin, 1993). Coastal erosion, saline intrusion, sea flooding, and land-based
  pollution already are serious problems that many of these countries face. Supplies
  of high-quality potable water often are inadequate, and water supply systems
  tend to lack adequate storage capacity. Moreover, valuable coastal ecological
  systems currently are stressed by human activities in the coastal zone and inland,
  reducing their capacity to adapt to the effects of climate change and sea-level
  rise. Pressures on these resources continue to increase in most small islands,
  partly as a consequence of high population growth rates, increasing urbanization,
  tourism development, and greater demand for material goods and services. </p>
<p>In addition, these island states are sensitive to changes in precipitation
  in terms of absolute amounts as well as spatial and temporal distribution. Similarly,
  island systems would be extremely vulnerable to any changes in the frequency
  or intensity of extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods, hurricanes, and storm
  surges). Indeed, vulnerability to these and other natural hazards-including
  some that may not be influenced by climate change (e.g., tsunamis, volcanoes)-contributes
  to the cumulative vulnerability of many small island states (Maul, 1996). </p>
