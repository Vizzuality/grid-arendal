<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The 16 countries of Tropical Asia range in size from about 61,000 ha (Singapore)
  to 300 million ha (India). The region is physiographically diverse and ecologically
  rich in natural and crop-related biodiversity. The present total population
  of the region is about 1.6 billion, and the population is projected to increase
  to 2.4 billion by 2025; although this population is principally rural, in 1995,
  the region included 6 of the 25 largest cities in the world. Exploitation of
  natural resources associated with rapid urbanization, industrialization, and
  economic development has led to increasing pollution, land degradation, and
  other environmental problems. Climate change represents a further stress. Over
  the long period of human occupation in the region, human use systems have developed
  some resilience to a range of environmental stresses. However, it is uncertain
  whether such resilience can continue in the face of rapid socioeconomic development,
  increasing population, and projected changes in climate. </p>
<p><b>Climate Characteristics and Trends</b> </p>
<p>Climate in Tropical Asia is characterized by seasonal weather patterns associated
  with the two monsoons and the occurrence of tropical cyclones in the two core
  areas of cyclogenesis (the northern Indian Ocean and the northWestern Pacific
  Ocean). Over the past 100 years, mean surface temperatures across the region
  have increased in the range of 0.3-0.8°C. No long-term trend in mean rainfall
  has been discernible over that period, although many countries have shown a
  decreasing trend in the past three decades. Similarly, no identifiable change
  in the number, frequency, or intensity of tropical cyclones has been observed
  in the region over the past 100 years; however, substantial decadal-scale variations
  have occurred. </p>
<p><b>Ecological Systems</b> </p>
<p>Substantial elevational shifts of ecosystems in the mountains and uplands of
  Tropical Asia are projected. At high elevations, weedy species can be expected
  to displace tree species, although the rates of vegetation change could be slow
  and constrained by increased erosion in the Greater Himalayas. Changes in the
  distribution and health of rainforest and drier monsoon forest will be complex.
  In Thailand, for instance, the area of tropical forest could increase from 45%
  to 80% of total forest cover; in Sri Lanka, a significant increase in dry forest
  and a decrease in wet forest could occur. Projected increases in evapotranspiration
  and rainfall variability are likely to have a negative impact on the viability
  of freshwater wetlands, resulting in shrinkage and dessication. Sea-level rise
  and increases in sea-surface temperature are the most probable major climate
  change-related stresses on coastal ecosystems. Coral reefs may be able to keep
  up with the rate of sea-level rise but may suffer bleaching from higher temperatures.
  Landward migration of mangroves and tidal wetlands is expected to be constrained
  by human infrastructure and human activities. </p>
<p><b>Hydrology and Water Resources</b> </p>
<p>The Himalayas play a critical role in the provision of water to continental
  monsoon Asia. Increased temperature and increased seasonal variability in precipitation
  are expected to result in accelerated recession of glaciers and increasing danger
  from glacial lake outburst floods. A reduction in flow of snow-fed rivers, accompanied
  by increases in peak flows and sediment yields, would have major impacts on
  hydropower generation, urban water supply, and agriculture. Availability of
  water from snow-fed rivers may increase in the short term but decrease in the
  long term. Runoff from rain-fed rivers may change in the future, although a
  reduction in snowmelt water would result in a decrease in dry-season flow of
  these rivers. Larger populations and increasing demands in the agricultural,
  industrial, and hydropower sectors will put additional stress on water resources.
  Pressure will be most acute on drier river basins and those subject to low seasonal
  flows. Hydrological changes in island and coastal drainage basins are expected
  to be small, apart from those associated with sea-level rise. </p>
<p><b>Agriculture</b></p>
<p>The sensitivity of major cereal and tree crops to changes in temperature, moisture,
  and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration of the magnitudes projected for the region
  has been demonstrated in many studies. For instance, projected impacts on rice,
  wheat, and sorghum yields suggest that any increases in production associated
  with CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization will be more than offset by reductions in yield resulting
  from temperature and/or moisture changes. Although climate change impacts could
  result in significant changes in crop yields, production, storage, and distribution,
  the net effect of the changes regionwide is uncertain because of varietal differences
  and local differences in growing season, crop management, and so forth; noninclusion
  of possible diseases, pests, and microorganisms in crop model simulations; and
  the vulnerability of agricultural areas to episodic environmental hazards, including
  floods, droughts, and cyclones. Low-income rural populations that depend on
  traditional agricultural systems or on marginal lands are particularly vulnerable.
</p>
<p><b>Coastal Zones</b> </p>
<p>Sea-level rise is the most obvious climate-related impact in coastal areas.
  Densely settled and intensively used low-lying coastal plains, islands, and
  deltas are especially vulnerable to coastal erosion and land loss, inundation
  and sea flooding, upstream movement of the saline/freshwater front, and seawater
  intrusion into freshwater lenses. Especially at risk are the large deltaic regions
  of Bangladesh, Myanmar, Viet Nam, and Thailand, and the low-lying areas of Indonesia,
  the Philippines, and Malaysia. Socioeconomic impacts could be felt in major
  cities, ports, and tourist resorts; artisinal and commercial fisheries; coastal
  agriculture; and infrastructure development. International studies have projected
  the displacement of several million people from the region's coastal zone in
  the event of a 1-m rise in sea level. The costs of response measures to reduce
  the impact of sea-level rise in the region could be immense. </p>
<p><b>Human Health</b> </p>
<p>The incidence and extent of some vector-borne diseases are expected to increase
  with global warming. Malaria, schistosomiasis, and dengue-which are significant
  causes of mortality and morbidity in Tropical Asia-are very sensitive to climate
  and are likely to spread into new regions on the margins of presently endemic
  areas as a consequence of climate change. Newly affected populations initially
  would experience higher case fatality rates. In presently vulnerable regions,
  increases in epidemic potential of 12-27% for malaria and 31-47% for dengue
  are anticipated, along with an 11-17% decrease for schistosomiasis. Waterborne
  and water-related infectious diseases, which already account for the majority
  of epidemic emergencies in the region, also are expected to increase when higher
  temperatures and higher humidity are superimposed on existing conditions and
  projected increases in population, urbanization rates, water quality declines,
  and other factors. </p>
<p><b>Adaptation and Integration</b> </p>
<p>Strategies for adapting to different climatic conditions will be quite diverse.
  For example, responses to impacts on agriculture will vary from region to region,
  depending on the local agroclimatic setting as well as the magnitude of climate
  change. New temperature- and pest-resistant crop varieties may be introduced,
  and new technologies may be developed to reduce crop yield losses. Countries
  in Tropical Asia could improve irrigation efficiency from current levels, to
  reduce total water requirements. Integrated approaches to river basin management,
  which already are used in a number of countries in the region, could be adapted
  regionwide. Such approaches could increase the effectiveness of adapting to
  the often-complex potential impacts of climate change that generally transcend
  political boundaries and encompass upstream and downstream areas. Similarly
  integrated approaches to coastal zone management can include current and longer-term
  issues, including climate change and sea-level rise. </p>
