<h4>11.3.3.3. Runoff and River Discharge </h4>
<p>Water resources in Tropical Asia could be significantly affected by climate
  change. Results from early greenhouse warming simulations in MPI-ECHAm<sup>3</sup> model
  experiments reported in Lal (1994) suggest that mean annual surface runoff throughout
  the region could increase by about 15% by the end of the century, with the greatest
  increases in northeast India and Indonesia. However, a more recent study (Lal
  et al., 1995b) that takes into account the combined effects of GHGs and aerosols
  suggests a future decline in surface runoff throughout the region. </p>
<p>In many parts of the region, the ratio of monsoon-to-dry-season runoff is very
  high (e.g., nearly 6:1 for the Ganges River). Because water requirements for
  agriculture and other water-use sectors are significantly higher during the
  dry season than during the monsoon, water supply in the dry season often cannot
  meet demand. Any change in the availability of water resources as a consequence
  of climate change may have a substantial effect on agriculture, navigation,
  fisheries, industrial and domestic water supply, reservoir storage and operation,
  and salinity control (Divya and Mehrotra, 1995; Mirza and Dixit, 1997). </p>
<p>Mirza (1997) applied empirical models using standardized precipitation scenarios
  from the CSIRO9, UKMO, GFDL, and LLNL GCMs to estimate changes in mean annual
  discharge of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers in Bangladesh. For the CSIRO9-E1
  (Whetton et al., 1993), GFDL-A2 (Whetherald and Manabe, 1986), and LLNL GCM
  experiments, the global warming value is equivalent to the climate sensitivity
  of the climate model (i.e., the equilibrium global mean temperature change for
  a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent concentration). For the UKMO-X5 GCM experiment
  (Murphy and Mitchell, 1995), the changes are defined as the difference between
  the mean climate state of one decade in the perturbed integration minus the
  climate state of the equivalent decade in the control integration. In the study,
  a 2-6°C temperature increase was considered; under a 4°C global mean temperature
  change scenario, mean annual discharge of the Ganges River could increase by
  27% (CSIRO9), 42% (UKMO), 15% (GFDL), or 2% (LLNL). Under the same temperature
  scenario, mean annual discharge of the Brahamaputra River may change by -0.1%,
  +13%, +9%, and +2% for the four GCMs, respectively. For higher temperature increases,
  the changes vary linearly. </p>
<p>The sediment load transported by these rivers is a nonlinear function of discharge.
  The implications of these increases in discharge on the sediment load of the
  Ganges and Brahamaputra-which already carry an extraordinarily heavy sediment
  load and have a high, though irregular, rate of downstream deposition-could
  be severe (Subramanian and Ramanathan, 1996). </p>
<p>Riebsame et al. (1995) conducted a study on the potential effect of climate
  change on water resources of the Mekong River basin. Equilibrium precipitation
  scenarios for doubled CO<sub>2</sub> from the GISS (Hansen et al., 1983), GFDL (Mitchell
  et al., 1990), and UKMO (Wilson and Mitchell, 1987) GCMs, as well as a transient
  scenario (for the year 2030) from the GISS GCM (Hansen et al., 1988), were used
  in the assessment. Riebsame et al. (1995) found slight or no changes in annual
  river flows, but they did detect changes in seasonality. Reduced hydropower
  production and low-flow augmentation from a planned cascade of 13 dams also
  were projected. </p>
