<h4>5.3.4.1. Adaptation </h4>
<p>People tend to respond to the threat of sea-level rise. Three broad response
  strategies can be distinguished: planned retreat, accommodation, and protection.
  In the latter strategy, land is maintained as it is now, albeit with a decline
  in natural functions and values. In the first strategy, coastal processes are
  allowed to occur naturally, but valuable developments are prevented or withdrawn
  in time. The strategy of accommodation is intermediate; the response in this
  case is to control the impacts of sea-level rise by changing land use. The strategy
  chosen depends on national circumstances, including the economic and ecological
  importance of the coastline, technical and financial capabilities, and the legislative
  and political structure of the countries concerned. </p>
<p>Because most low-lying coastal areas in Europe already are protected from flooding,
  a rise in sea level by itself will not cause serious inundation of human-occupied
  areas. Assuming other climatic factors remain constant, the protection offered
  by the flood defenses will decline as sea level rises, but its effectiveness
  will not disappear immediately (see, e.g., Kelly, 1991, for a discussion of
  the Thames Barrier, which protects London). Based on the GVA, the reduction
  in flood protection will be largest around the Mediterranean (Nicholls and Hoozemans,
  1996). Anticipating accelerated sea-level rise in the design of new flood defenses
  will counter this effect (U.K. Department of the Environment, 1996). </p>
<p>Analysts often employ simplifying assumptions regarding response strategies.
  The costs in <a href="114.htm#table5-4">Table 5-4</a>, for example, assume that
  all densely populated areas will be protected. An alternative assumption is
  that the costs of protection (including the monetary values of nature) will
  be balanced against the costs of land loss. Fankhauser (1994) analyzed this
  assumption for countries in the OECD. He concludes that it is optimal to protect
  all harbors and cities. Open coasts and beaches need to be maintained and protected
  in densely populated areas (such as The Netherlands) and in areas where beach
  tourism is important (such as Greece, Italy, and Spain). On the other hand,
  areas with low population density (such as Norway and Iceland) and poorer areas
  (such as Turkey) have a lower optimal level of protection. Turner et al. (1995)
  analyzed protection in East Anglia, England. At the regional scale, protection
  can be justified for the entire coast. When the 113 individual flood compartments
  were evaluated, however, the study indicated that it may not be economically
  justifiable to continue to protect 20% of compartments, even with modest rates
  of sea-level rise. This analysis assumes that there is no interaction between
  flood compartments-which may not always be the case. However, it suggests that
  a range of responses, rather than a single response, may be appropriate at regional
  and national scales. </p>
<p>Responses may be hindered by resource constraints. In Cyprus, the coast is
  almost totally sediment-starved as a result of catchment regulation and management
  (Nicholls and Hoozemans, 1996), and there are no ready sources of sand available
  for beach nourishment. Yet maintaining the beach is critical to the tourist
  industry. Therefore, external (and hence costly) sources of sand may be required
  for beach nourishment. Many other Mediterranean islands appear to have similar
  problems. </p>
<p>Some adaptation that anticipates climate change already is being implemented,
  despite the costs (U.K. Department of the Environment, 1996). In The Netherlands,
  national policies that outlaw erosion and mandate maintenance to the present
  shoreline position already are in place (Koster and Hillen, 1995). In the Ebro,
  Rhone, and Po deltas, conceptual and quantitative models of deltaic responses
  to sea-level rise are being developed (Jimenez and Sanchez-Arcilla, 1997; Sanchez-Arcilla
  and Jimenez, 1997). The ultimate goal of this work is to harness natural processes
  within deltas to counter global and local (due to subsidence) sea-level rise.
  However, other coastal settings often are not being managed with climate change
  in mind (Nicholls and Hoozemans, 1996). This approach often ignores numerous
  opportunities to use existing changes, such as the redevelopment cycle of coastal
  urban areas, to adapt to climate change (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 9). Planning
  for and responding to sea-level rise raise important questions of equity, such
  as who pays for eroded land (if retreat is a response). These issues remain
  to be addressed systematically. </p>
<p>A more strategic and integrated perspective regarding coastal management and
  shoreline protection has been triggered by climate change, although resulting
  efforts have to consider more than just climate change. In Britain, guidelines
  for estuary management (English Nature, 1993) and shoreline management (U.K.
  Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food et al., 1995) have been published,
  and a number of shoreline management plans and estuary management plans have
  been completed or are being formulated. Recognition of sediment cells and the
  benefits of erosion and beach nourishment in terms of sediment supply to other
  parts of the cell are being more fully realized (Bray et al., 1996). The flood-prevention
  benefits of coastal wetlands also are being assessed. In eastern Britain, some
  managed setback schemes have been carried out on a pilot basis. In these areas-which
  had previously been reclaimed for agriculture-the sea defense has been realigned
  and the seawall breached to recreate areas of salt marsh and intertidal habitat.
  This strategy is expected to assist in the restoration of natural balance in
  estuaries and to provide flood alleviation benefits. It is anticipated that
  larger-scale application of such defense realignment, in appropriate locations,
  may be required to counter expected losses of intertidal habitat and relieve
  pressure on artificial defenses from sea-level rise. Such a policy may find
  more widespread application in Europe and would help minimize wetland losses
  resulting from sea-level rise. </p>
