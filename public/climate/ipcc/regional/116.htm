<h4>5.3.5. Other Infrastructure/Activities/Settlement </h4>
<h4>5.3.5.1. Energy Demand<a name="energy"></a> </h4>
<p>Energy demand will be affected by warming, but the direction and strength of
  the impact are unclear. Air conditioning (cooling) is a relatively new but growing
  source of energy demand in northern Europe, and warmer summers would increase
  this demand. Such a tendency would enhance the urban heat island effect and
  thereby heat stress. Increased demand for irrigation water also would augment
  the demand for energy. On the other hand, warmer winters would reduce the demand
  for heating energy. </p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, peak demand for heating fuels might decline less than
  total annual demand (as a result of a shortened heating season), leading to
  a reduced demand load factor. On aggregate, UK demand for fossil fuels may decline
  by 5-10% and electricity demand by 1-3% for a 2.2°C temperature rise by 2050;
  Finnish electricity demand would fall by 7-23% for a temperature increase of
  1.2-4.6°C; Russian fossil fuel demand would fall by 5% and electricity demand
  by 1% for a 2.0°C temperature increase (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 11). </p>
<h4>5.3.5.2. Water Supply<a name="supply"></a> </h4>
<p>As discussed in <a href="111.htm">Section 5.3.3</a>, GCM-based analyses project
  a range of possible runoff trends-from slightly drier to slightly moister conditions
  in Europe in the future. Many European rivers are likely to have less flow in
  dry periods of summer, aggravating problems of water supply to major cities.
  Numerous public supplies depend on groundwater (e.g., 94% of Portuguese supplies);
  any decrease in winter recharge could have serious implications. Reduced runoff
  also would negatively affect cooling of electric-power and industrial plants,
  particularly if there are environmental constraints on waste-heat production.
  For example, several French nuclear power stations were forced to close down
  or operate well below design capacity during the 1991 drought (IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Chapter 14). </p>
<p>Anticipated climatic changes in Greece are likely to dramatically increase
  the risk of summer water shortages. Significant increases in storage capacity
  would be needed to maintain existing water and energy supplies. The Netherlands
  could face the desiccation of most of its wetland areas or be forced increasingly
  to rely on the Rhine to maintain present water levels. Groundwater aquifers
  could be affected by increased saltwater intrusion as sea level rises. Given
  a possible 4°C temperature increase and a rise in the Alpine snow line of 700
  m in summer, the summer flow of the Rhine could decline by 10%. A temperature
  increase of only 0.5°C and a daily rainfall decrease of 0.08 mm would decrease
  runoff in Hungary by 25-30%. Despite projected wetter winters, drier summers
  and increased evaporation in southeastern England may reduce yields in impounding
  reservoirs by 8-15%. Aquifer yields (which are very important to the London
  area) may fall by 8%. Supplies of water during warmer, possibly drier, summers
  would need to be maintained through larger storages or transfers from wetter
  regions. Water quality may deteriorate because there would be less river flow
  to dilute contaminants (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 10). </p>
<h4>5.3.5.3. Water Demand<a name="demand"></a> </h4>
<p>Increasing temperatures intensify water demand-particularly for agriculture,
  human consumption (e.g., watering of gardens and lawns), cooling water for electric-power
  and industrial plants, and natural ecosystems (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 14).
  Changing precipitation also modifies demands for irrigation, particularly in
  regions with soils of low water-storage capacity (e.g., northern Germany, Denmark,
  Poland). </p>
<h4>5.3.5.4. Air Pollution<a name="pollution"></a> </h4>
<p>More stable anticyclonic conditions in the summer would provide increased opportunities
  for ground-level ozone to build up and lead to deteriorating urban air quality.
  Existing problems in Mediterranean cities such as Athens will increase if conditions
  become drier. Summertime smog (largely ground-level ozone) has become a significant
  problem in many parts of Europe (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 12). The extent of
  these problems in the future will very much depend on future transport policies
  in affected areas. </p>
<h4>5.3.5.5. Construction and Infrastructure<a name="infra"></a> </h4>
<p>In general, risks to construction and infrastructure are caused by extreme
  events (e.g., droughts, high winds) rather than average conditions. In northern
  Europe, the greatest negative impacts on construction are likely to arise from
  river floods. Studies by Kwadijk and Middelkoop (1994) and Penning-Rowsell et
  al. (1996) show that small increases in winter precipitation could lead to drastic
  increases in flood depths. Unless adaptive measures are installed in time, flood
  damage also would increase dramatically. Increased summer drought would aggravate
  land subsidence induced by clay-shrinkage, affecting dwellings particularly
  in England and Poland (Brignall et al., 1996). Increased summer drought also
  would heighten fire danger, especially in the Mediterranean area. In temperate
  and northern climates, higher temperatures will result in lower road maintenance
  costs, particularly if snowfall and the number of freeze-thaw cycles decrease
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 11). </p>
<h4>5.3.5.6. Insurance<a name="insurance"></a> </h4>
<p>Insurance companies are vulnerable to climate change through changes in windstorms,
  droughts, and floods that could affect covered property (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter
  17). Flood insurance can be bought on the free market only in the United Kingdom;
  other European countries have government-backed insurance or none at all (Albala-Bertrand,
  1993). Thus, possible increases in flood magnitudes and frequencies are unlikely
  to seriously affect the insurance sector. Droughts affect insurance only through
  the impact of land subsidence on buildings. Damage to buildings from windstorms
  is widely covered by insurance in Europe. Dorland et al. (1996) show that an
  increase of a few percent in storm intensity (not inconsistent with GCM results)
  could double or triple storm damages, most of which are insured. This effect
  occasionally could lead to troubles in the insurance sector-witness the total
  insured losses of $10 billion (compared with $15 million total losses) during
  the first months of 1990. Storm damage insurance, however, accounts for only
  a tiny fraction of total property insurance (Tol, 1996). </p>
<p>Europe is home to the largest reinsurance companies in the world. Reinsurers
  insure other insurance companies from all over the world for large losses-for
  instance, losses resulting from natural disasters. Thus, increases in floods
  or tropical cyclones in highly developed areas may affect Europe's financial
  sector. Experience in the early 1990s shows that the reinsurance market is capable
  of rapid reform under stress-which indicates that climate change could well
  lead to incidental turmoil but is unlikely to cause structural problems (Tol,
  1996). </p>
