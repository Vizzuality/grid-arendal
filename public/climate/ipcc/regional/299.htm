<h4>11.3.4.3. Fisheries </h4>
<p>Few studies have been done on the possible impact of climate change on fisheries
  in Tropical Asia, despite the fact that commercial and subsistence marine and
  freshwater fisheries and aquaculture are important for the food security and
  the economies of many countries in the region. In the Philippines, for instance,
  fisheries account for about 4% of gross national product (GNP). The fisheries
  sector employs nearly a million people-about 26% of whom are engaged in aquaculture
  operations, 6% in commercial fishing, and 68% in marine and freshwater municipal
  fishing (i.e., artisinal, small-scale, or traditional fisheries) (Lim et al.,
  1995). Overexploitation of inshore and inland fisheries in most countries of
  south and southeast Asia threatens fishery resources as well as the livelihoods
  of the fishermen. </p>
<p>Section 16.2 of the Working Group II contribution to the SAR (IPCC, 1996) identified
  climate change impacts on several types of fisheries and considered health and
  infrastructural issues. For marine fisheries, slight changes in environmental
  variables-such as temperature, salinity, wind speed and direction, ocean currents,
  strength of upwelling, and predators-can sharply alter the abundance of fish
  populations (Glantz and Feingold, 1992). Rises in sea level also may cause saline
  water fronts to penetrate further inland, which could increase the habitat of
  brackish-water fisheries. Coastal inundation also could damage the aquaculture
  industry. </p>
<p>The effect on inland fisheries may be felt strongly because large sections
  of the region's population consume freshwater fish. Fisheries at higher elevations
  may be particularly affected by lower oxygen availability resulting from increases
  in temperature. In the plains, the timing and amount of precipitation may affect
  the migration of fish species from the river to the floodplains for spawning,
  dispersal, and growth. If the magnitude and extent of floods increase, more
  flood-control projects would further deplete floodplain fisheries. Current annual
  losses of open-water fish in Bangladesh from flood-control and drainage projects
  are estimated to be 65 kg/ha (Mirza and Ericksen, 1996). </p>
<h4>11.3.5. Mountain and Upland Regions<a name="mountain"></a> </h4>
<p>Scenarios of climate change in the mountainous regions of the world are highly
  uncertain; they are poorly resolved even in the highest-resolution GCMs (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 5.2). A few impact studies have been carried out in the
  mountain regions of Tropical Asia, where topography and elevation also have
  an important influence on the regional climate. </p>
<p>In Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India, for instance, mountains provide food,
  fuel, and fresh water-which are needed for human survival and are fundamental
  resources for tourism and economic development. Tourism contributes about 24%
  of Nepal's foreign-exchange earnings (HMGN, 1992). Seasonal variations in the
  water resources of Nepal's Himalaya region are very high: The maximum-to-minimum
  discharge ratios for the Karnali, Sapt Gandaki, and Sapt Kosi rivers are 120:1,
  180:1, and 105:1, respectively. This variation is due mainly to heavy and concentrated
  rainfall during a short time period; steep topography, which encourages higher
  surface runoff; and the high rate of deforestation in the watersheds (Uprety,
  1988). </p>
<p>At high elevations in the Himalayas, an increase in temperature could result
  in faster recession of glaciers and an increase in the number and extent of
  glacial lakes-many of which, according to Watanabe et al. (1994), have formed
  in the past several decades. The rapid growth of such lakes could exacerbate
  the danger from glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), with potentially disastrous
  effects. GLOFs result from the failure of moraine dams when excessive hydrostatic
  pressure is exerted on dam walls as a result of increased melting and increased
  water depth in lakes. In a warmer world, GLOFs could be expected to increase
  in number and severity throughout the Himalayas of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.
  Recent examples, which may be suggestive of increasingly frequent occurrences
  in the future, include the catastrophic outburst of two glacial lakes in the
  Lunana area, northern Bhutan, in October 1994 (which resulted in the deaths
  of 21 persons and damage to villages, washed away bridges, and filled water
  with debris and large logs) and the 1985 outburst flood in Khumbu Himal, Nepal
  (Watanabe and Rothacher, 1996). </p>
<p>Devastating floods occur in the central Himalaya of Nepal during the monsoon
  months of June through September. Monsoon floods differ from GLOFs and floods
  caused by breaching of landslide dams: They are of longer duration and less
  sudden in onset. The incessant rainfall of August 1987 submerged parts of central
  and eastern Terai in waters of as much as 1 m (BNJST, 1989). Damage from floods
  takes several forms, including the destruction of footbridges that often provide
  the only link between remote mountain villages; demolition of irrigation diversions;
  mass-wasting by undercutting of steep, stream-adjacent slopes; and damage to
  floodplain agricultural land by erosion and sedimentation (Marston et al., 1996).
</p>
<p>The effects of climate change on soil erosion and sedimentation in mountain
  regions of Tropical Asia may be indirect but could be significant. An erosion
  rate in the range of 1-43 tons/ha-with an average of 18 tons/ha-was calculated
  in three small experimental plots in central Nepal. Over the 3-year period of
  the experiment, 40-96% of the annual losses occurred during two storms (Carver
  and Nakarmi, 1995). Uprety (1988) found a statistically significant correlation
  between monsoon precipitation in the Karnali and Spata Kosi watersheds in Nepal
  and sediment load. In a single storm in 1993, Sthapti (1995) reported a sediment
  load into the reservoir of the Kulekhani hydropower project in Nepal that was
  about 35 times higher than the design value. Increased severity and frequency
  of monsoonal storms and flooding in the Himalayas, which are expected outcomes
  of climate change, may significantly alter the area's erosion, river discharge,
  and sediment dynamics. Eventually, this may affect existing hydropower reservoirs,
  as well as those planned for construction in the Himalayas. Part of the generated
  sediment may be deposited on agricultural lands or in irrigation canals and
  streams, which will contribute to a deterioration in crop production and in
  the quality of agricultural lands. </p>
