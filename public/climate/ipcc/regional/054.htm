<h4>3.3.7. Navigation </h4>
<p>Reduced sea-ice extent and thickness would increase the seasonal duration of
  polar navigation on rivers and in coastal areas that are presently affected
  by seasonal ice cover (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.5). Improved opportunities
  for water transport, tourism, and trade at high latitudes are expected as a
  result. These activities will have important implications for the people, economies,
  and navies of nations along the Arctic rim (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 7 Executive
  Summary). Reduced sea ice will provide safer approaches for tourist ships and
  new opportunities for sightseeing around Antarctica and the Arctic (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Section 7.5.5). Increased calving of icebergs from the Antarctic Peninsula
  may, however, affect navigation and shipping lanes north of the Antarctic Convergence.
  Decreased sea-ice extent around Antarctica could make it easier for tourist
  vessels with less preparedness for sea-ice travel to visit the continent and
  surrounding islands. Some may be ill-prepared to navigate and respond to the
  extreme and highly variable environmental conditions in the Southern Ocean.
  There is no clear consensus, however, about whether the frequency of icebergs,
  and their danger to shipping, will change with global warming (IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Section 7.4). Increased precipitation may reduce the enthusiasm for tourism
  in some areas. </p>
<p>Projected reductions in the extent and thickness of the sea-ice cover in the
  Arctic Ocean and its peripheral seas could substantially benefit shipping, perhaps
  opening the Arctic Ocean as a major trade route (IPCC 1996, WG II, Technical
  Summary, Section 3.2.4). This projection would include the opening of both the
  NorthWest Passage and the Russian Northern Sea Route for up to 100 days a year.
  One French experiment indicated that the use of the Northeast Passage in ice-free
  seasons shortened by about 3 weeks the shipping duration between Europe and
  Far East Asia compared with the present route (i.e., via the Suez Canal). Although
  a reduction of sea ice may be a boon to international shipping and consumers
  in East Asia, North America, and Western Europe, policies designed to limit
  the total burden of pollutants entering the Arctic environment from ports, ship
  operations, and accidents may have to be developed (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter
  8 Executive Summary). </p>
<p>Less river ice and a shorter ice season in northward flowing rivers of Canada
  and Russia should enhance north-south river transport. Combined with less sea
  ice in the Arctic, this development would provide new opportunities for reorganization
  of transport networks and trade links. Ultimately, those changes could affect
  Northern Hemisphere trading patterns (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.5.1). </p>
<p>A survey of the potential impacts on Canadian shipping suggested net benefits
  to Arctic and ocean shipping due to deeper drafts in ports and longer navigational
  seasons, with mixed results for lake and river shipping due to the opposing
  effects of a longer shipping season but lower drafts. Demands to maintain Arctic
  shipping may increase. In Siberia and Canada, many rivers are used as solid
  roads during winter. Warmer winters would require a shift to water transport
  or the construction of more all-weather roads. Other impacts on means of transport
  could arise from changes in snowfall or melting of the permafrost (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Section 11.5.2.1). </p>
<p>Currently, ice-breaking efforts are an expensive aspect of navigation in the
  Arctic. Interannual variability prevents the elimination of these programs unless
  extreme changes in sea ice should occur. Some ice-breaking programs in some
  areas may be cut back with moderate warming of the Arctic. In other areas, costs
  may rise to keep newly available routes open longer. A disappearance of sea
  ice south of Labrador would eliminate Canadian Coast Guard ice-breaking requirements.
  This would mean an annual saving of CDN$15-20 million. Even larger savings also
  can be expected in the former Soviet Union if ice retreats from the shores of
  the Kara, Laptev, and Chukchi Seas. Similar savings would accrue along the Gulf
  of Bothnia with the absence of ice. The effect of annual warming on ice calving
  (simulated using a simple degree-day model) shows that for every 1°C of warming
  there would be a 1° latitude retreat of iceberg occurrence in the Atlantic Ocean.
  In the Southern Ocean, any effects of reduced sea ice will be economically less
  pronounced (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.5.3).</p>
<p>Offshore oil and gas exploration and production conducted at high latitudes
  may be assisted by a longer ice-free season. A possible beneficial effect would
  be shorter winters to disrupt construction, exploration, and drilling programs.
  A decrease in thickness and extent of sea ice in the Arctic will extend the
  drilling seasons for floating vessels considerably. A reduction in sea ice and
  icebergs also will reduce "downtime" on offshore oil and gas drilling explorations.
  Currently such interruptions cost Canadian explorations more than CDN$40 million
  annually. The most critical factor could be ice movement during winter. If there
  were increased numbers and severity of storm surges and wave activity, design
  requirements for offshore structures and associated coastal facilities would
  increase, and oil spill clean-up could become more difficult (IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Section 7.5.4). </p>
<h4>3.3.8. Sub-Antarctic Islands<a name="islands"></a> </h4>
<p>The sub-Antarctic islands are small land areas surrounded by vast areas of
  the Southern Ocean. Some of these islands are sufficiently high to possess glaciers
  and small ice caps. Their climate is characterized by strong and persistent
  winds, little sunshine, many rain days, and cool temperatures. They are generally
  uninhabited, though they contain highly specialized flora and important marine
  mammal and bird populations. </p>
<p>Many of these islands have shown a tendency for warming over the last half
  of this century. Their future climate will be controlled by changes in the surface
  temperature of the Southern Ocean and the strength of Southern Hemisphere westerlies.
  The sub-Antarctic islands are expected to continue to warm. The impacts of climate
  change are unlikely to be important for most animal and bird species, but there
  could be changes in the species composition of plant communities. Glaciers will
  probably shrink. </p>
