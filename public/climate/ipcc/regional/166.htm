<h4>7.3.4.3. Climate Change and Desertification </h4>
<p>Desertification may occur in any area where the potential evapotranspiration
  is greater than 70% of the total precipitation-as is the case for parts of this
  region. It is feasible that desertification itself can exacerbate climate change.
  Changes in land-use practices can affect surface temperatures through boundary
  changes in vegetation cover, which lead to differences in albedo and thus to
  temperature differences (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapters 3 and 4). It has been suggested
  that where these changes occur over large areas, they could affect global mean
  temperatures. The effect is mediated in the short term by surface soil moisture
  and in the longer term by changes in soil conditions and in carbon sequestration,
  which lead to changed emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O and methane. There are no specific data
  from this region to support or refute this possibility. </p>
<p>There also is a great deal of variation in assessments of the nature and severity
  of the desertification problem, mainly because of the lack of adequate data.
  Many large-scale studies have suggested that the annual rate of expansion of
  desertified lands in central Asia ranges from 0.5% to 0.7% of the arid zone.
  Approximately 570 million ha in the region are classified as arid land. Assuming
  a conservative rate of expansion of 0.5% per annum, 3 million ha of land are
  becoming desertified every year. Arid-land desertification could occur faster
  if human and livestock populations continue to increase and particularly if
  the resilience of arid regions is negatively affected by climate change. Some
  recent research, however, has not supported the expanding-desert hypothesis.
  During favorable or "wet" years, there is little evidence to suggest that the
  desertification front has expanded. The different views regarding the importance
  of human abuse versus adverse climatic conditions in causing desertification
  and the lack of agreement on the scale of the problem point to the need for
  a better understanding of the problem and, in particular, better and more comprehensive
  data on its nature and extent. There is little doubt that desertification is
  an important environmental problem that needs to be addressed urgently-and that
  climate change will have an impact on it (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 4), with
  environmental and economic repercussions. </p>
<p>Some of the Middle Eastern countries recently have launched action plans to
  reduce the effects of desertification (UNEP, 1997), though the results of these
  actions remain to be seen. There also are many technical programs in the Middle
  East to assist in desertification problems (UNEP, 1997). </p>
<h4>7.3.5. Coastal Systems<a name="coastal"></a> </h4>
<ul>
  <li><i>Coastal systems in the region are under threat from pollution and development,
    resulting in the deterioration of fish populations in some countries. No scenarios
    suggest that projected changes in sea level will have significant effects
    on the region as a whole. Certain coastlines of the region (e.g., around the
    Caspian Sea and Karachi) are predicted to be threatened by development.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Seven of the 21 countries in the region are landlocked; the others have a total
  of 21,000 km of coastline, mainly on the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Oman.
  Coastal zones in this region are not identified as significantly affected by
  sea-level changes (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 12). The major pressures on them
  will be related to development rather than the direct result of climate change.
</p>
<p>Part of the Mediterranean Sea, the northWestern part of the Gulf of Oman, the
  southern part of the Caspian Sea, and the coast of Karachi are classified as
  coastlines under high potential threat from development (WRI, 1996; McMichael
  et al., 1996). This development includes large cities (>100,000 people), major
  ports, roads, and pipelines-all of which contribute to pollution in coastal
  areas. </p>
<p>Many countries in the region are major oil producers. Oil production is mostly
  land-based and is not as vulnerable to the impacts of climate change as offshore
  oil production in other regions. Transportation of oil also is less likely to
  be affected than some higher-latitude areas, which are projected to experience
  an increase in storm activity and icebergs (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 8.2).
  However, coastal oil production areas are likely to be affected by storm surges
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 8.3.1 and 9.3.1). </p>
<p>Coastal pollution is a major problem in some countries of the Middle East.
  Some countries (e.g., Syria, Lebanon) have integrated coastal management programs
  to overcome some of these problems (UNEP, 1997). Despite such programs, the
  Red Sea and the Kuwait/Oman areas sustain more oil pollution than anywhere else
  in the world. In addition, coastal zones of the Middle Eastern countries experience
  oil spills from ships and pipelines, as well as land-based pollution discharges
  (UNEP, 1997)-all of which lead to the deterioration of coastal areas. </p>
<p>Fishery industries are important in some countries (e.g., the Persian Gulf
  countries in the Middle East). Overfishing and marine pollution have led to
  a decrease in fish catches. The loss of mangroves and intertidal areas (e.g.,
  from dredging/infilling) probably has added to the problem by affecting breeding
  grounds (UNEP, 1997). </p>
<p>Preliminary studies and estimates show that if climate change were to cause
  an increase in flow from the Volga river, the resulting rise in the level of
  the Caspian Sea would significantly increase the vulnerability of its coastal
  zone, requiring some adaptation measures (Golubtsov and Lee, 1995). </p>
