<h1>8.2. Regional Climate Information </h1>
<h4>8.2.1. Current Climate<a name="current"></a> </h4>
<p>North America possesses a multitude of diverse regional climates as a consequence
  of its vastness, its topography, and its being surrounded by oceans and seas
  with widely varying thermal characteristics. The North American region as analyzed
  in this report (see <a href="305.htm#figureA-3">Figure A-3</a> in <a href="305.htm">Annex
  A</a>) extends latitudinally from approximately the Arctic Circle to the Tropic
  of Cancer and longitudinally from the Aleutian Islands in the west to the Canadian
  maritime provinces in the east. The regional atmospheric circulation is dominated
  by disturbances (waves) in the upper-level westerly winds. The development of
  these waves defines the position of the main upper-level jet stream over the
  continent and thus the position of the so-called Polar Front at the surface,
  which generally separates colder, drier air to the north from warmer, moister
  air to the south. In the colder half of the year, the position of the Polar
  Front can vary greatly, from southern Canada to the southern reaches of the
  United States. Such large shifts in the Polar Front are associated with long,
  high-amplitude waves that often cause one part of the continent to experience
  warm, moist, southerly airflow while another part experiences a blast of dry
  and cold Arctic air (meridional flow). These conditions may persist for lengthy
  periods because of the typically slow movement of these longer waves. At other
  times, however (mainly in the fall and spring), shorter, weaker waves move more
  quickly across the continent-producing highly variable weather with rapidly
  changing, but not extremely high or low, temperatures and short wet and dry
  periods. In the summer, the Polar Front retreats well into Canada, for the most
  part, and two oceanic semipermanent high-pressure systems tend to dominate the
  North American weather; as a result, there typically are fewer and weaker synoptic-scale
  disturbances in the westerlies. In summer and autumn, tropical storms of Atlantic,
  Caribbean, or Gulf of Mexico origin occasionally impact the Atlantic and Gulf
  coasts. </p>
<p>The temperature regime over North America varies greatly. Over all seasons,
  mean temperatures generally increase from the extreme north along the Arctic
  Ocean to the southern United States. Mean annual and wintertime temperatures
  along the west coast of the continent generally are higher than at equivalent
  latitudes inland or on the east coast because of the warming influence of Pacific
  air. During the winter in the far north, the long polar nights produce strong
  radiative cooling over the frozen Arctic Ocean and the typically snow-covered
  reaches of Alaska and Canada. This results in very cold surface temperatures
  and a temperature inversion that acts to inhibit cloud development, creating
  a positive feedback on the radiational cooling process. In this way, vast pools
  of cold, dense air (Arctic high-pressure systems) are formed and move over central
  and eastern North America; they sometimes move southward as far as the Gulf
  of Mexico. These extreme cold air outbreaks usually are confined to areas east
  of the Rocky Mountains; they often can produce temperatures below -40°C in the
  heart of the continent, with attendant sea-level pressure readings in excess
  of 1050 mb. To the west of the Rockies, warmer maritime airflow off the Pacific
  Ocean produces milder winters along the coast; the western cordillera effectively
  restricts this mild air from reaching and thus modifying temperatures in the
  interior. The eastern maritime regions of the continent enjoy much less warming
  influence from the Atlantic Ocean during these cold air outbreaks because the
  prevailing air flow is off the land (Schneider, 1996). Nevertheless, in winter
  the east and west coastal regions of Canada and the United States usually are
  warmer than inland regions, with the Pacific and Gulf coasts and Florida experiencing
  the shortest and mildest winters (Schneider, 1996). </p>
<p>In summertime, the large amount of insolation received over the very long days
  in the northern reaches of North America acts to raise temperatures there so
  that these areas are more in line with much of the rest of the continent, thus
  decreasing the north-south temperature gradient. The coldest areas are found
  in the western Canadian mountains and along the Labrador coast (Schneider, 1996).
  The highest continental temperatures are found in the U.S. desert southWest
  and southern plains states, where temperatures routinely exceed 38°C (~100°F).
  Occasionally, extreme summer heat waves spread over much of the central United
  States and parts of central and eastern Canada. These conditions can persist
  for days or weeks when occasional blocking high-pressure ridges form; these
  ridges may extend from the central United States to the western Atlantic. The
  hot air can be extremely humid because of low-level southerly airflow off warm
  Gulf of Mexico waters. The combination of heat and humidity produces dangerous
  health conditions that have resulted in significant numbers of fatalities (e.g.,
  the July 1995 heat wave over the midwestern United States). </p>
<p>Annual precipitation amounts over North America show large spatial variations.
  The wettest regions lie along the Pacific coast, extending generally from Oregon
  to southern Alaska-with mean annual totals exceeding 300 cm at several Canadian
  locations (Environment Canada, 1995). The other main continental maximum in
  annual precipitation is located in the southeastern United States. It is centered
  mainly along the central Gulf coast states during winter, spring, and autumn
  and over Florida in the summer (Higgins et al., 1997). Mean annual precipitation
  amounts along the central Gulf coast exceed 150 cm. </p>
<p>Another precipitation maximum typically is observed over the midwestern United
  States (centered roughly over Missouri and Iowa) (Higgins et al., 1997) in the
  summer months, where mean rainfall (mainly convective in nature) typically exceeds
  25 cm. This feature is associated with convection that often is fueled by a
  strong low-level southerly jet stream bringing abundant moisture from the Gulf
  of Mexico. The active convection often begins in the spring and continues through
  the summer, causing severe local- to regional-scale flooding. The convective
  activity observed over the Midwest, the Great Plains, and the southeastern United
  States also is responsible for the fact that this part of the United States
  experiences more severe weather (in the form of thunderstorms, tornadoes, and
  hail) than any other part of the world. Although North American annual precipitation
  is much more climatologically consistent than in many other parts of the world
  (e.g., northern Africa and eastern Australia), extremely damaging large-scale
  droughts and floods sometimes occur, often in association with blocking patterns
  in the large-scale circulation. </p>
