<h4>8.3.6.2. Oceans </h4>
<p>An early review (Wright et al., 1986, summarized by Mann, 1993) projected that
  for the northern Atlantic, some of the consequences of global warming could
  include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A rise in the average sea surface temperature, causing an increase in evaporation
    and a more vigorous hydrological cycle of precipitation, runoff, and so forth</li>
  <li>The greatest increase in evaporation in mid-latitudes, leading to increased
    precipitation in northern regions, increased river runoff, increased stability
    of the water column, and increased strength of buoyancy-driven currents such
    as the Labrador current</li>
  <li>An increase in the north-south gradient in salinity</li>
  <li>A decrease in the thickness and extent of ice cover</li>
  <li>A reduction of the north-south temperature gradient and possibly a reduction
    in average wind stress over the whole of the north Atlantic, which could lead
    to a decrease in the strength of wind-driven currents such as the Gulf Stream.</li>
</ul>
<p>In their summary of the Symposium on Climate Change and Northern Fish Populations,
  Sinclair and Frank (1995) described the variability of the northern Pacific
  in circulation and mixing and linked that variability in part to shifts in atmospheric
  circulation-specifically, the changes in the location and level of the Aleutian
  low-pressure system. Existing models have not been able to shed light on the
  most probable responses of the northern Pacific to a doubling of atmospheric
  CO<sub>2</sub>. </p>
<p>Mann (1993) briefly considered various sources of data for the wind-driven
  coastal upwelling system off California. He suggested that available data could
  be used to support the hypothesis that coastal upwelling increases during global
  cooling but decreases during global warming. </p>
<h4>8.3.6.3. Impacts, Adaptations, and Vulnerabilities of Ocean Fisheries Resources<a name="impact"></a></h4>
<p><i>Overall, there likely will be relatively small economic and food supply
  consequences at the regional/national level; however, impacts are expected to
  be more pronounced at the subregional level.</i> </p>
<p>Natural climate variability-for example, changes in ocean temperatures and
  circulation patterns associated with the El Niño phenomenon and with the northern
  Pacific gyre-affects the distribution and composition of fisheries. Because
  interannual and decadal-scale natural variability is so great relative to global
  change and the time horizon on capital replacement (ships and plants) is so
  short, impacts on fisheries can be easily overstated; there likely will be relatively
  small economic and food supply consequences in the United States and Canada
  at the national level. At the state or regional level, impacts (positive and
  negative) will be more pronounced, particularly when a center of production
  shifts sufficiently to make one fishing port closer to a resource while a traditional
  port becomes more distant. Over time, fishing vessels and their support structure
  will relocate, followed by processors and eventually families as well. Community
  impacts can be significant. </p>
<p>Changes in primary production levels in the ocean as a result of climate change
  may affect fish stock productivity. As a first step in assessing the role of
  changes in primary production on fish productivity, global primary production
  in the ocean has been estimated by Longhurst et al. (1995) using satellite measurements
  of near-surface chlorophyll fields. Annual global primary production was estimated
  at 45-50 Gt carbon (C)/year. This annual global primary production is the sum
  of the annual primary production in 57 biogeochemical provinces covering the
  world ocean. More than 10 such provinces border North America. For example,
  the total primary production is estimated at 0.37 Gt C/year in the "California
  Upwelling Coastal" province and 1.08 Gt C/year in the "NorthWest Atlantic Continental
  Shelf" province. </p>
<p>Exactly how climate-induced changes in primary production would affect the
  next trophic link, zooplankton, remains a matter of debate (e.g., Banse, 1995).
  However, changes in zooplankton biomass are known to affect fish stock productivity.
  Brodeur and Ware (1995) identified a twofold increase in salmonid biomass in
  the eastern subarctic Pacific since the 1950s, coincident with a large-scale
  doubling of the summer zooplankton biomass in the same region. Beamish and Bouillon
  (1995) examined trends in marine fish production off the Pacific coast of Canada
  and the United States. They concluded that the carrying capacity for fish in
  the northern North Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea fluctuates in response to
  long-term trends in climate. </p>
