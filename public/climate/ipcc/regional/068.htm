<h4>4.3.1.4. Aquatic and Marine Ecosystems </h4>
<p>Aquatic ecosystems are exposed to the primary effects of local changes in temperature,
  sunshine, wind, and so forth and to a wide range of secondary effects, particularly
  from changes in hydrology and waterborne materials. Increased water temperatures,
  increased evaporation, and changes in inflows and flooding would change the
  thermal and chemical structures of rivers and lakes. These changes would directly
  affect the nutrient status of aquatic ecosystems; the survival, reproduction,
  and growth of organisms; the distribution and diversity of species; and overall
  ecosystem productivity (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 10.5, 10.6). Changes in rainfall
  produce disproportionate changes in runoff and in mean flows and levels of rivers
  and some lakes; these effects might be exacerbated if the climate were to become
  more variable, with more frequent flood and drought events. Sea-level rise is
  likely to have significant effects on lowland aquatic ecosystems near the coasts.
  (Coral reefs are discussed in <a href="070.htm">Section 4.3.1.5.</a>) </p>
<p>An increased frequency of more intense rainfalls would increase the intensity
  of runoff events and thus might contribute greater inputs of nutrients, organic
  material, agricultural waste, and sediment (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.5).
  This could lead to reduced water quality, stress on some species, and potentially
  increased biological productivity forming nuisance growths. Waterways in the
  many intensively farmed areas of the region may be particularly vulnerable to
  increased pollution by fertilizers, animal waste, and agrochemicals, with greater
  potential for algal blooms and aquatic plant proliferation. Algal blooms and
  eutrophication already are a major problem in many of Australasia's inland waters
  (SOEC, 1996). Excessive plant growth in lowland streams can reduce drainage
  capacity and increase risks of flooding. </p>
<p>Sediment transport following heavy rainfall can smother extensive areas of
  estuarine habitat, resulting in loss of breeding habitat essential to many coastal
  fish species and affecting food supply for seabirds. Such an extreme event occurred
  in New Zealand's Whangapoua estuary in 1995. Any increase in extreme rainfall
  events and sedimentation would be likely to have major impacts on river, lake,
  estuarine, and coastal waters-particularly the Great Barrier Reef lagoon (Larcombe
  et al., 1996)-and lead to reduced aesthetic values and reduced recreational
  and tourist use. </p>
<p>In the lowland coastal rivers and floodplains of northern Australia, the possibly
  lower rainfall projected by the revised climate change scenarios (CSIRO, 1996a)
  would most likely lead to greatly decreased biodiversity because it has been
  found that poor wet seasons reduce the extent and duration of inundation-which
  in turn has dramatic impoverishing effects on the abundance and diversity of
  the biota. Drier conditions would likely lead to a decrease in the problem of
  insect-borne diseases, however. These floodplains may be particularly prone
  to the impacts of sea-level rise (Steering Committee of the Climate Change Study,
  1995; Waterman, 1995), whereby storm surges, cyclonic floods, and seawater intrusions
  could devastate the freshwater biota. The possible effect of climate change
  on the present invasion of floodplains by aquatic and semi-aquatic weeds (Lonsdale,
  1994; Miller and Wilson, 1995), or on future invasions, is unclear. </p>
<p>The fauna of small lowland tropical streams in northeastern Australia appear
  to be susceptible to depletion by floods and to have a relatively low rate of
  recovery (Rosser and Pearson, 1995), which suggests that an increase in the
  frequency and magnitude of extreme events may lower the diversity of lowland
  rainforest streams. In contrast, upland rainforest streams have a high diversity
  (Pearson et al., 1986) and appear to be relatively resilient (Benson and Pearson,
  1987; Rosser and Pearson, 1995). A study in southeast Australia found that droughts
  deplete introduced trout but not the native galaxiids, resulting in an expansion
  of galaxiid populations downstream with the death of trout (Closs and Lake,
  1996); thus, with increased drought the range of native fish in such small streams
  might increase. </p>
<p>The many ephemeral river and lake ecosystems in inland Australia (temporary
  rivers and lakes that only flow and fill occasionally) (Boulton and Lake, 1988;
  Lake, 1995) are attuned to high climate variability, but their resilience to
  long-term change in the frequency and intensity of events is less certain. Information
  on their biota is scanty. A survey of the small and intermittently flowing streams
  of the George Gill Range in central Australia found an unexpected diversity
  in species (Davis et al., 1993). Although increased temperature and droughts
  may threaten the viability of fish populations in this region, such changes
  may not greatly alter the invertebrate biota-which appear to be well adapted
  to variability in water availability. Breeding cycles of water birds may be
  affected (Hassall and Associates, 1997; see also <a href="#box4-1">Box 4-1</a>).

      <p>A collaborative study by a consulting company, two New South Wales (NSW)
	government agencies, and the CSIRO has made a preliminary integrated assessment
	of the impacts of climate change on the management of the scarce water
	resources of the Macquarie River basin in northern NSW (Hassall and Associates,
	1997). The catchment contains dryland agriculture (mainly wheat) and pastoralism,
	irrigated agriculture (mainly cotton), several small towns, and an episodically
	flooded wetlands area known as the "Macquarie Marshes," which is a major
	breeding area for birds. Over the past decade, agricultural and pasture
	production of sheep, beef, wool, wheat, and cotton contributed 92% to
	the regional economy. </p>
      <p>The study considered the impacts of "low change" and "high change" climate
	scenarios in the region by 2030, based on estimates from the CSIRO regional
	climate model nested in the CSIRO slab-ocean GCM (experiment F1, <a href="003.htm#table1-1">Table
	1-1</a>), and IPCC (1996a) ranges of uncertainty in global warming. Spatially
	and seasonally varying projected rainfall and temperature changes in the
	catchment ranged from about 0 to -15%, and 0.4 to 1.2°C, respectively.
	These were used in a catchment model to quantify possible changes in moisture,
	runoff, and water supplies. Output was then used in the IQQM river management
	model developed by the NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation.
	Consequences for the pastoral, agricultural, and wider economy of the
	region were then considered, using simple models of yield and income on
	climate. Consideration of the need for "environmental flows" in the river
	and to ensure wetland breeding habitat led to limitations on water diversions
	for irrigation. Results of this study showed that mean annual runoff to
	the Burrendong Dam (the main water-storage facility) was reduced by 11%
	in the low-change scenario and by 30% in the high-change scenario, with
	correspondingly less water available for irrigation under present river
	management rules. Using optimistic assumptions regarding the beneficial
	effects of increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on crops and pastures, the study
	found aggregate losses to the agricultural economy in 2030 of 6% in the
	low-change case and 23% in the high case. Beneficial effects of increased
	CO<sub>2</sub> on cotton approximately balanced the effects of climate change, but
	this was less true for wheat. By far the biggest losses were for sheep,
	beef, and wool, which constitute 63% of total agricultural production
	in the region. <br>

      <p>The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service forecast that, if the rules
	were not changed, the loss of water supply would lead to reduced filling
	of the Macquarie Marshes and thus reduced or less frequent breeding of
	some bird species, with possible local or regional extinctions, depending
	on what changes occur in other breeding areas.</p>
