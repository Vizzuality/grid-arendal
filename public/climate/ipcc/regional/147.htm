<h4>6.3.7. Industry, Energy, and Transportation </h4>
<p>Weather and climate play decisive roles in many artificial systems; climate
  variability and climate change would affect these activities, with beneficial
  and adverse impacts. These effects include direct impacts on the planning, implementation,
  and operation of industry; energy production; and transportation, as well as
  on the economics of corresponding systems. Climate affects markets for goods
  and services and the natural resources on which such economic activity depends
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 11.5). Activities directly sensitive to climate include
  construction, fossil fuel production (including offshore drilling), water-dependent
  manufacturing, hydropower generation, space heating and air conditioning, tourism,
  and recreation. Industry located in coastal zones and flood-prone areas also
  would likely be affected by climatic variations. Other activities that depend
  on climate-sensitive resources include agro-industries (food/drink, forestry-related
  activities, and textiles), production of energy from biomass fuels (see<a href="141.htm">
  Section 6.3.4</a>), and activities associated with the production of other renewable
  energy. </p>
<p>Agro-industry is of relatively greater significance in Latin American countries
  where activities associated with agriculture constitute the bulk of the economy,
  than elsewhere. Agro-industries that depend on the production and transportation
  of products such as grain, sugar, and rubber are vulnerable to changes in precipitation
  patterns and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Globalization
  undoubtedly will better define the future activities of some Latin American
  countries. The strategy of "dumping" industrialized products-which has been
  carried out by more developed countries and some of the Far East's emerging
  economies-suggests that Latin American countries might well reorient their development
  toward agro-industry to take advantage of their natural resources and secure
  a place in international markets. The inception of regional markets would facilitate
  a combination of agricultural and agro-industrial production capacities within
  the region, assuming that available natural resources are evaluated, through
  monitoring and research, in the light of projected climate change. This route
  could lead to the region's sustainable development and the improvement of its
  productive capacity to satisfy the demands of an increasing global population.
</p>
<p>An important domain within these agro-industries is the development of energy
  sources through biomass exploitation (see <a href="141.htm">Section 6.3.4</a>).
  In Brazil, the Fuel-Alcohol Program-one of the largest commercial biomass-to-energy
  programs-has facilitated the substitution of ethanol for gasoline in passenger
  cars and light vehicles (Goldenberg et al., 1993). Technological advances, including
  more efficient production and processing of sugarcane, are responsible for the
  availability and low price of ethanol. The transition to ethanol fuel has reduced
  Brazil's dependence on foreign oil (thus lowering its import-export ratio),
  created significant employment opportunities, and greatly improved urban air
  quality. In addition, because sugarcane-derived ethanol is a renewable resource
  (cane is replanted at the same time that it is harvested), the combustion of
  ethanol adds virtually no net CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere-and thus helps reduce the
  threat of global warming. Hydropower production would be influenced by changes
  in precipitation; whether these changes would be beneficial depends heavily
  on the relationship between seasonal patterns of precipitation and electricity
  demand. In Costa Rica and the Cuyo region in Argentina, for example, energy
  production already is affected by climate variability. Whereas hydroelectricity
  contributed 14.5% of the world's generated electricity in 1986, hydroelectric
  sources satisfied 53% of Latin America's electrical energy demands in that year
  (of the rest, 34% was supplied through thermal generation and the remaining
  13% was shared between nuclear and geothermal generation). Of the world's technically
  exploitable hydroelectric potential, Latin America (excluding Mexico) accounts
  for 3,500 TWh per year. The region has an installed capacity of 86.69 GW, which
  in 1988 generated 367 TWh (Moreira and Poole, 1992); thus, about 20% of the
  potentially exploitable hydroenergy was used. Under these circumstances, the
  region would be in a position to increase its hydropower production to satisfy
  increasing demands during the coming century, even if climate change results
  in some reductions in power generation. (This hypothesis assumes the operation
  of new dams and stations, starting in the early 1990s-particularly in South
  America-and the installation of interconnected transmission networks among countries
  in the region.) </p>
<p>As noted in <a href="150.htm">Section 6.5</a>, sensitivity studies and monitoring
  of water resources are needed to prevent serious adverse climate change impacts.
  However, other factors affecting hydropower generation may have more weight
  than those resulting from climate change-such as social and environmental impacts,
  which may be the principal constraints and sources of uncertainty affecting
  hydropower development. Large storage reservoirs exacerbate many problems, particularly
  in tropical regions. The impacts of hydropower development can be categorized
  as direct-such as those that arise while constructing the dam, filling the reservoir,
  and changing the river flow-or indirect, such as effects on the health and well-being
  of the community and local ecosystems. However, many of these problems can be
  reduced by improved planning, in coordination with national or regional communities
  and their participatory social movements [e.g., non-governmental organizations
  (NGOs)]. </p>
<p>Although the energy, industry, and transportation sectors are of great economic
  importance and clearly are sensitive to climate change, the capacity for autonomous
  adaptation is relatively high, as long as climate change takes place gradually.
  The lifetimes of most assets are relatively short compared with projected time
  scales for climate change (Campos et al., 1996). </p>
