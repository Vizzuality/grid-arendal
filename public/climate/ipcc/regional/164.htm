<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>General assessments have suggested a range of positive and negative impacts
  of climate change on agriculture. Positive examples include decreasing frost
  risks and more productive upland agriculture, provided water availability does
  not decline (or irrigation is available) and appropriate cultivars are used.
  Increasing populations of pests and disease-causing organisms-many of which
  have distributions that are climatically controlled-may have a negative impact
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 5.2.4.1). A number of factors affect the vulnerability
  of agricultural systems: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Agro-industry, biomass production, and renewable energy sources depend heavily
    on climate-sensitive resources and therefore are potentially vulnerable to
    climate change.</li>
  <li>Climate change could have a severe impact on countries that are dependent
    on single crops. Diversification of economic activity could be an important
    precautionary response.</li>
  <li>The burden of climate change may affect lower-income households disproportionately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Studies for sub-Saharan Africa suggest that there are critical thresholds related
  to precipitation and the length of the growing season that may affect agricultural
  practices. The yield of cereals in the Mediterranean climatic region is projected
  to decline as a consequence of increased drought resulting from the combination
  of increased temperature and decreased precipitation (or precipitation increases
  that are insufficient to counter higher evapotranspiration) (IPCC 1996, WG II,
  Section 13.6.7). In Kazakstan, where wheat is a major crop, spring wheat yields
  are projected to decrease by almost 60% under CCC-J1 and GFDL-A3 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium
  climate scenarios; winter wheat yields are projected to increase by about 20%.
  Because only 1% of the total cropland is suitable for winter wheat, this increase
  is not likely to significantly affect overall wheat yields, and the overall
  effect would be a decrease in wheat yield (Pilifosova et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Studies in Pakistan project a decline in wheat yields under GISS and UKMO scenarios
  with 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equivalent, while under a GFDL scenario with 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equivalent an
  increase is projected (Qureshi and Iglesias, 1994). However, the results are
  highly dependent on assumptions made about the responsiveness of crops to high
  CO<sub>2</sub> levels. </p>
<p>If there is a decrease in rangeland productivity in the region as a result
  of temperature increases, the overall contribution of the agricultural industry
  to national economies would decline. Such a decrease also would have serious
  implications for the food policies of many countries-and for the lives of thousands
  of pastoral people (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 2). </p>
<p>Some options to minimize the adverse effects of climate change are available.
  For example, rangelands in Kazakstan support sheep and goats, which are important
  for wool production. According to the CCC-J1 and GFDL-A3 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium climate
  scenarios, wool production in this country is projected to decrease by 10-25%
  (Pilifosova et al., 1996). Possible adaptations identified from modeling studies
  include changing the current lambing and sheep shearing dates; however, this
  approach would be feasible only after considerable reeducation efforts were
  undertaken in the region. </p>
<p>In the rangelands of the Middle East and Arid Asia region, active selection
  of forage plants and greater control of animal stocking rates are the most promising
  management options for decreasing the negative impacts of projected climate
  changes (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 2). Introducing or selecting some legume
  species in grassland systems-which would reduce reliance on fertilizer inputs
  and improve the nutritive value of forage-could make these systems more sustainable
  and resilient under climate change (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 2). Use of various
  kinds of domestic animals, game ranching, multiple production systems, and commercial
  hunting and tourism (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 4) are management options that
  also may facilitate socioeconomic activity in the region. These strategies could
  be viewed as "no regrets" options by many countries in the region because they
  would be beneficial even without climate change. </p>
<p>A shift in reliance toward more suitable and more intensively managed land
  areas for food and fiber production could have the dual benefits of allowing
  greater reliability in food production and reducing the detrimental impacts
  of extreme climatic events, such as drought, on rangeland systems (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Chapter 2). Runoff farming-a form of water management that originated
  about 3,000 years ago in parts of the region-has been largely abandoned in some
  countries. It may provide opportunities, however, for sustainable cropping and
  horticulture under changed climates (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 4). </p>
<p>In some countries, marine and/or freshwater fish are important sources of protein.
  The demand for fish is increasing along with increasing populations; this demand
  is expected to at least double by 2020, compared with 1995 levels. The increase
  in demand is expected to be met through inland aquaculture in earthen ponds,
  through mariculture in the Mediterranean (Mires, 1996), and through imports
  (e.g., Israel already imports 60% of its fish protein). </p>
<p>Many freshwater wetlands of great importance to agriculture and wildlife occur
  in the floodplains of lakes and rivers (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 6.5.2). Water
  levels that fluctuate as a result of either human activity or climate-related
  changes may cause lakes to become separated from their bordering wetlands more
  frequently. Because a number of lake fish use these wetlands for spawning and
  nursery areas (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.6.2.2), fish productivity may be
  affected-thus affecting the whole food chain. </p>
