<h4>6.2.3. Climate Variability </h4>
<p>Climate variability means the alternation between the "normal climate" and
  a different, but recurrent, set of climatic conditions over a given region of
  the world. In the Latin American region, climatic variability is related, inter
  alia, to the Southern Oscillation (SO) and the El Ni�o phenomenon (EN). Studies
  on the SO effects, using an SO Index (SOI), have shown its connection with pressure,
  temperature, and rainfall, as well as with hydrometeorological anomalies (e.g.,
  record river discharges and lake levels) (Aceituno, 1987). </p>
<p>Prominent among SO-related anomalies in South America is the well-documented
  tendency for anomalously-wet conditions along the otherwise arid coast of northern
  Peru and southern Ecuador during El Ni�o episodes (Rasmuson and Carpenter, 1982).
  The relationship between the SO and rainfall anomalies in northeastern Brazil
  has long been recognized (Walker, 1928; Doberitz, 1969; Caviedes, 1973; Hastenrath,
  1976; Kousky et al., 1984). Rainfall anomalies related to the SO in extratropical
  South America have been documented primarily for central Chile (Rubin, 1955).
  A tendency for precipitation in subtropical Chile to be exceptionally abundant
  during El Ni�o years has been noted. This relationship is consistent with the
  significant negative correlation between pressure differences (Tahiti minus
  Darwin) and annual precipitation in central Chile (Pittock, 1980) and snow accumulation
  in the southern Andes (Cerveny et al., 1987). Rainfall in the Central America-Caribbean
  domain also is related to the SO, as revealed by the tendency for drought conditions
  to occur during warm episodes off the Peruvian coast (Hastenrath, 1976). </p>
<p>The strong El Ni�o episode in 1982-83, which coincided with a marked negative
  SO phase, was associated with extreme climatic conditions in various parts of
  South America. Examples include the convection regime associated with flooding
  in northern Peru (Horel and Cornejo-Garrido, 1986), droughts in northeastern
  Brazil (Rao et al., 1986), and the remarkable precipitation and circulation
  anomalies over South America (Nobre and De Oliveira, 1986; Minetti and Vargas,
  1995). </p>
<p>During recent decades, the influence of the ENSO phenomenon on the interannual
  variability of weather and climate in South America has been the research subject
  of other authors (Berlage, 1966; Burgos et al., 1991; Santiba�ez and Uribe,
  1994; Vargas and Bishoff, 1995; IPCC 1996, WG I, Chapter 4). During ENSO years,
  precipitation in some areas of northern South America is lower (Aceituno, 1987),
  increasing the likelihood of drought. ENSO events also can lead to higher precipitation
  and air temperature, as has occurred in the coastal deserts of Peru and Chile
  (Caviedes, 1973). In addition, these events are related to massive fluctuations
  in marine ecosystems of the southern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, with adverse
  socioeconomic consequences for commercial fishing and fishmeal production in
  Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Argentina (Pauly and Tsukayama, 1987; Pauly et al.,
  1987; Pauley et al., 1989; Ya�ez, 1991; Bakun, 1993; Sharp and McLain, 1993).
</p>
<p>Records of precipitation in countries of the Central American isthmus show
  an important reduction in precipitation during the ENSO period, particularly
  along the Pacific watershed. This reduction has considerable effects on the
  most important economic activities and sectors in these countries (Campos et
  al., 1996). </p>
<p>It is unclear whether the ENSO phenomenon would change with long-term global
  warming-and what the consequences would be of overlapping sources of climatic
  variability on the Earth's systems. However, ENSO effects have been used by
  regional scientists to help define real scenarios that could be useful as analogs
  for climate change and for studies of potential responses of the countries and
  sectors affected (Campos et al., 1996). </p>
