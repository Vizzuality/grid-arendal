<h4>7.3.4. Food and Fiber for Human Consumption </h4>
<ul>
  <li><i>Many countries in the region are highly dependent on agriculture. Land
    degradation problems and limited water supplies restrict present agricultural
    productivity and threaten the food security of some countries. There are few
    projections of the impacts of climate change on food and fiber production
    for the region. However, many of the options available for combating existing
    problems will contribute to reducing the anticipated impacts of climate change.
    A shift in reliance toward more suitable and more intensively managed land
    areas for food and fiber production-along with selected plant and animal introductions-could
    be beneficial, allowing greater reliability in food production; such approaches
    also would reduce the detrimental impacts of extreme climatic events, such
    as drought, on rangeland systems. Implementation of more flexible risk-management
    strategies (e.g., long-term and appropriate stocking rates, responding to
    variations in precipitation by changing animal numbers annually)-along with
    the use of various kinds of domestic animals, game ranching, multiple production
    systems, commercial hunting, and tourism-would facilitate socioeconomic activity
    and provide some food security to the region. These strategies can be viewed
    as "no regrets" options that might be adopted by many countries in the region
    because they would be beneficial even without any climate change. </i></li>
</ul>
<h4>7.3.4.1. Food and Fiber Production Systems<a name="food"></a> </h4>
<p>The climate of the region greatly limits the portion of land presently suitable
  for livestock production and crop agriculture. Two-thirds of the domestic livestock
  are supported on rangelands (IPCC 1996, WG II, Table 2-1), although in some
  countries, large percentages of animal fodder come from crop residues (e.g.,
  70% in Pakistan) (Pakistan Country Report, 1994). In many countries, crop agriculture
  is highly dependent on irrigation because rainfall is low and highly variable
  (Khan, 1985; UNEP, 1997). Only 8 of the 21 countries of the region have more
  than the world average area of arable land per person (0.26 ha/person); some
  countries have effectively no arable land. (Kazakstan is an exception, with
  more than 2 ha of arable land per person.) Nevertheless, agriculture is an important
  sector in the region as a whole, contributing a high proportion of the GDP in
  about half of the countries (>10% net added value in agriculture as a percent
  of GDP, compared with the world average of about 5%; World Bank, 1997). About
  a third of the GDP of the Kyrgyz Republic, Syria, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan
  can be attributed to agriculture. </p>
<p>Many countries in the region (e.g., the countries of the FSU, Syria, Israel),
  are highly dependent on local agriculture for food; although some (e.g., Turkey
  and Kazakstan) are major food exporters, most countries are net importers of
  food (World Bank, 1997). Some countries (e.g., Tajikistan) rely heavily on imports
  of grain, both for human consumption and for livestock production (World Bank,
  1995b). Land degradation and the consequential need to move to even more marginal
  lands threaten food security and the economies of countries that are highly
  dependent on agriculture. </p>
<p>In some countries, up to 89% of the croplands are irrigated (41% for the region
  as a whole; see <a href="156.htm#table7-1">Table 7-1</a>). Improved irrigation
  practices (e.g., wider use of drip and underground irrigation) could save up
  to 50% of the water used in conventional irrigation systems (IPCC 1996, WG II,
  Chapter 4). Adoption of such conservation techniques could become increasingly
  important if climate change leads to reduced water availability. The expansion
  of winter-growing crops that demand much less water (and would use more of the
  projected precipitation in the region) may be another option (IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Chapter 4). Some of the FSU countries are making major changes in agricultural
  practices and would be able to incorporate new varieties that might respond
  better to low-water conditions (e.g., cotton in Tajikistan) (World Bank, 1995b).
</p>
<p>Increasing populations in areas with limited arable land have led some countries
  (e.g., Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen) to use irrigated farming throughout the
  year, as well as to increase their use of fertilizers and pesticides (UNEP,
  1997); these trends may add to the land degradation problem. </p>
<p>Little quantitative work has been done on the impacts of climate change on
  this sector. National and local assessments providing a detailed understanding
  of crop-specific responses and regional impacts for this region are still lacking
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.6.1). </p>
