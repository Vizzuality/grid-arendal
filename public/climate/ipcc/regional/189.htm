<p>The Queen Maud Gulf lowlands contain one of the largest sites (over 6 million
  ha) designated under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance.
  They are part of the southern Arctic ecozone, a transitional area between the
  taiga forest to the south and the treeless arctic tundra to the north. The ecozone
  includes the major summer range and calving grounds for Canada's largest caribou
  herds, as well as habitat for bear, wolf, moose, arctic ground squirrels, and
  lemmings. It is a major breeding and nesting ground for a variety of migratory
  birds, including yellow-billed, arctic, and red-throated loon; whistling swan;
  snow goose; oldsquaw; gyrfalcon; ptarmigan; and snowy owl (Ecological Stratification
  Working Group, 1995). It also is home to Canada's Inuit, whose subsistence lifestyle
  includes a diet dependent on this wildlife diversity. According to the U.S.
  Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service MAPSS biome model using a variety
  of GCM simulations, this ecozone will nearly disappear from mainland North America
  under a climate brought about with CO<sub>2</sub> doubling (Neilson, 1993a,b,, 1995; Neilson
  and Marks, 1994; see also <a href="315.htm">Annex C</a> in this report). </p>
<p><i>Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations may have a negative influence on forage quality
  and species diversity within North American rangeland ecosystems. </i></p>
<p>Based on studies of plants grown in CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched environments (Owensby et al.,
  1993; IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 2), it has been suggested that forage quality
  in rangeland ecosystems may decrease with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> levels as a result
  of associated increases in carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and in concentrations of
  unpalatable and toxic substances, as well as decreases in mineral concentrations
  in the forage. There is evidence from field studies that low soil nitrogen-a
  common constraint on rangelands (McNaughton et al., 1988; Seastedt et al., 1991)-can
  limit plant growth responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (Owensby et al., 1994; Schäppi
  and Körner, 1996). Several studies have suggested that litter produced at increased
  levels of CO<sub>2</sub> will be nitrogen poor or that increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations slow
  nitrogen mineralization and reduce nitrogen availability to plants (Díaz et
  al., 1993; Morgan et al., 1994; Gorissen et al., 1995). This decreased decomposition,
  mineralization, and uptake of nitrogen could initiate a negative feedback on
  nitrogen availability that reduces plant growth and forage production. </p>
<p>Without dietary supplementation, the growth and reproduction of individual
  animals could decrease as CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations rise (Owensby et al., 1996). Rates
  of nitrogen input, litter quality, and frequency of events (like fire) that
  promote substantial nitrogen loss all mediate how quickly nitrogen accumulation
  and cycling approach the maximum at any given CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Aber et al.,
  1991). Potential production and forage quality on many rangelands therefore
  may be constrained by management practices that promote nitrogen loss or preclude
  nitrogen accumulation by limiting species change (Polley, 1997). </p>
<p>The existing data on the effect that rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations will have on
  the nitrogen cycle are ambiguous. Rising CO<sub>2</sub> may increase nitrogen input to
  rangelands directly or indirectly by promoting nitrogen fixation. Some of the
  most successful woody invaders in grasslands are legumes (e.g., species of the
  Acaia and Prosopis genera). Symbiotic fixation of nitrogen in these species
  can be significantly stimulated (+400%) by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (Polley
  et al., 1994; Polley et al., 1997). By adding fixed nitrogen to rangelands in
  litterfall or root turnover, these woody invaders could potentially increase
  productivity if the nitrogen gains are not offset by losses or conversion of
  nitrogen to recalcitrant forms (Polley, 1997). Kemp et al. (1994) reported that
  the ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at which plants were grown had little effect on
  the decomposition of standing dead material of three tallgrass prairie species.
  O'Neill and Norby (1996) concluded that decomposability of naturally abscissed
  leaf litter was not greatly affected by the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at which the litter
  was produced. </p>
<p>On grasslands where the effects of increased WUE are not negated by an increase
  in leaf temperature and leaf area, rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentration should slow the
  depletion of soil water by grasses and potentially favor shrubs/woody plants
  that otherwise might succumb to water stress (Polley et al., 1997). There is
  evidence that rising CO<sub>2</sub> also could contribute to species change by altering
  seedling survival rates during drought. Polley et al. (1996) found that more
  than twice as many honey mesquite tree seedlings survived soil-water depletion
  at elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels than at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> levels. In the absence of fire or
  browsing, woody plants likewise would be expected to increase in size and abundance
  by exploiting the greater availability of soil water (Polley, 1997). Grass production
  and transpiration often decline following woody plant invasion (Vallentyne,
  1971; Scifres, 1980; Knoop and Walker, 1985; Sala et al., 1989). </p>
<p>By increasing the growth rates of woody seedlings or improving their ability
  to survive drought, rising CO<sub>2</sub> could act as a positive feedback to overgrazing
  in promoting woody plant invasion (Polley et al., 1997). An increase in woody
  plants may result in decreased forage availability in mid-latitude grassland
  ecosystems and increased soil erosion, leading to a nearly irreversible loss
  of productive potential of the soil (Parton et al., 1993). </p>
<p>Since the turn of the century, mesic and arid grasslands in North America have
  had increases in C<sub>3</sub> woody plants (Branson, 1985; IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 2).
  This change often has been accompanied by changes in runoff, accelerated soil
  erosion, and loss of the grazing resource (Rauzi and Fly, 1968; Spaeth et al.,
  1996). Increases in CO<sub>2</sub> and changes in regional climate could exacerbate the
  existing problem of loss of production on western rangelands by accelerating
  the invasion of woody plants. Mayeux et al. (1991) discuss evidence that C<sub>4</sub>
  grasslands are being increasingly invaded by C<sub>3</sub> woody plants-a process that
  may have been abetted by the rise in CO<sub>2</sub> and changes in WUE over the past two
  centuries. However, conclusive evidence for this effect is not available (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Chapter 2). </p>
