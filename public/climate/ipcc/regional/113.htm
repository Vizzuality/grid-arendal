<h4>5.3.3.3. Adaptation Options </h4>
<p>Of all the systems that are sensitive to climatic change, the cryosphere may
  be the most vulnerable; no adaptation measure can counter the disappearance
  of snow and ice in an environment that is likely to experience more frequent
  episodes of above-freezing temperatures than at present. In very restricted
  situations, the use of snowmaking equipment may help to extend the skiing season
  in particular areas, but this solution is expensive, and its environmental impact
  has not been fully evaluated. </p>
<p>In terms of water resource management, technological measures-including land-use
  criteria and erosion control, reservoirs and pipelines to increase the availability
  of freshwater supply, and improvements in the efficiency of water use-can be
  envisaged. Socioeconomic options should include direct measures to control water
  use and land use, as well as indirect measures such as incentives or taxes;
  institutional changes for improved resource management also may be needed. Specific
  examples of possible options include supplementing rain-fed agriculture with
  irrigation; water-conserving irrigation practices; enhanced coordination of
  surface and groundwater management; changes in cropping patterns; watershed
  management; structural and nonstructural flood-control management; and reallocation
  of water resources among water-use sectors and among nations. </p>
<h4>5.3.4. Coastal Zones<a name="coastal"></a> </h4>
<p>Coastal zones are characterized by highly diverse ecosystems that are important
  as sources of food and habitats for many species. In many areas in Europe, population,
  economic activity, and arable land are concentrated in coastal zones, which
  has led to a decrease in their resilience and adaptability to variability and
  change. Some coastal areas-such as much of The Netherlands, the fens in eastern
  England, and the Po River plain (Italy)-already are beneath mean sea level;
  many more areas are vulnerable to flooding from storm surges. Fixed, rigid flood
  defenses and sea-level rise already are causing "coastal squeeze" (i.e., a decline
  in intertidal coastal habitats). </p>
<p>Sea-level rise and possible changes in the frequency and/or intensity of extreme
  events-such as temperature and precipitation extremes, cyclones, and storm surges-represent
  consequences of climate change that are of most concern to coastal zones. Except
  for sea-level rise itself, there currently is little understanding of the possible
  interaction of different aspects of climate change in the coastal zone. Other
  possible changes in climate could be costly. In The Netherlands, the costs of
  protection against an adverse 10% change in the direction and intensity of storms
  may be worse than the costs of a 60-cm rise in sea level (Peerbolte et al.,
  1991; IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 9). </p>
<p>Under the IS92a scenario, global sea level is projected to rise by about 5
  mm/yr (with an uncertainty range of 2-9 mm/yr). This increase is two to five
  times the rate experienced over the past century. Regional and local sea-level
  rise will not necessarily be the same as the global average because of vertical
  land movements (glacial isostatic rebound, tectonic activity, subsidence) and
  possible changes in ocean water characteristics (oceanic circulation, wind and
  pressure patterns, ocean water density). Other climatic change in Europe is
  uncertain. An increase in precipitation intensity seems likely, increasing the
  flood risk in low-lying coastal areas. </p>
<p>Without adaptation, a rise in sea level would inundate and displace wetlands
  and lowlands, erode shorelines, exacerbate coastal storm flooding, increase
  the salinity of estuaries, threaten freshwater aquifers, and otherwise impact
  water quality. The impacts would vary from place to place and would depend on
  coastal type and relative topography. Areas most at risk would be tidal deltas,
  low-lying coastal plains, beaches, islands (including barrier islands), coastal
  wetlands, and estuaries. Tidal range also is a key factor: In general, the smaller
  the tidal range, the greater the response to a given rise in sea level. This
  pattern suggests that the Mediterranean and Baltic coasts, with their low tidal
  range, may be more vulnerable to sea-level rise than the open ocean coasts.
</p>
<p>Examples of susceptible coasts include the Rhone, Po, and Ebro deltas (Jimenez
  and Sanchez-Arcilla, 1997; Sanchez-Arcilla and Jimenez, 1997). These areas already
  are subsiding because of natural and sometimes human factors, and they are sediment-starved
  as a result of changes in catchment management. For example, the Ebro delta
  has lost 97% of its sand supply since the 1950s. Reduction or loss of these
  areas would impact important agricultural and natural values. Many of Europe's
  largest cities-such as London, Hamburg, St. Petersburg, Thessaloniki, and Venice-are
  built on estuaries and lagoons (Frasetto, 1991). Such locations are exposed
  to storm surges, and climatic change is an important factor to consider for
  long-term development. In Venice, a 30-cm rise in relative sea level this century
  has greatly exacerbated flooding and damage to this unique medieval city; permanent
  solutions to this problem are still being investigated. Beaches tend to erode
  given sea-level rise, which destroys a valuable resource and exposes human activities
  landward of the beach to increased wave and flood action. Intense recreational
  use of beaches in many coastal areas, particularly around the Mediterranean,
  makes this erosion a particular problem; some response to such changes often
  is essential. In higher latitudes, gravel beaches are more common than sand
  beaches (Carter and Orford, 1993). Gravel beaches often provide an important
  coastal protection function, which sea-level rise may disrupt. </p>
