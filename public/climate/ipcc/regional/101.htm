<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Increased climatic stress is likely to result in increased amounts of dead
  plant material within forests. At the same time, potential increased carbon-to-nitrogen
  ratios as a result of increased CO<sub>2</sub> may reduce decomposition rates; this effect
  remains uncertain, however: Some studies suggest no change (e.g., Norby et al.,
  1995), whereas increased temperatures are likely to increase decomposition rates
  in areas such as northern Scandinavia (Johansson, 1994; Johansson et al., 1995).
  The net effect of these different trends is largely unknown. Increased volumes
  of dead organic matter, combined with drier climatic conditions, would increase
  the fire hazard in many forests. The Mediterranean zone is likely to be particularly
  affected, but other areas also are likely to see an increase in the fire hazard.
  Boreal forests, which currently are mainly temperature-limited, could become
  soil moisture-limited if warmer temperatures in spring and summer lead to earlier
  melting of snowpack and drying of soil in summer. This shift would lead to increased
  risk of biomass loss through drought-driven mortality and fire. Reduced winter
  snowpacks also may increase the risk of winter damage to trees during periods
  when air temperatures are above zero and the ground remains frozen. Cold winters
  in boreal zones and some temperate regions have protected forests from many
  of the insects and fungi that are common further south; a warmer climate is
  likely to change this situation (Cammell and Knight, 1992; Straw, 1995). </p>
<p>Many forested regions of Europe have been cleared through human land-use practices-particularly
  in western, central, and southern Europe. In the Alps, for example, the timberline
  currently is as much as 200 m below its natural potential limit because of overgrazing
  by game and livestock and the removal of trees over several centuries to provide
  summer grazing areas (Holtmeier, 1994). If warming is accompanied by drier conditions
  in the Alps and Pyrenees, a northward and upward progression of Mediterranean
  ecotypes is likely to occur. </p>
<p>There is a large degree of uncertainty regarding the sensitivity of soil respiration
  to changing heat and moisture conditions, as well as to nitrogen deposition
  rates. As a result, nutrient availability and hence overall ecosystem productivity
  could either increase or decline (see, e.g., Heath and Kerstiens, 1997). A warmer
  climate, particularly in the form of warmer winters, may favor certain pests
  or pathogens-such as bark beetles, aphids (Straw, 1995), or fungi (Brasier,
  1996). Because many of these species live in complex relationships with their
  hosts, as well as with predators and other animals, it is difficult to predict
  the broad-scale net effect of climate change on them. </p>
<p>Many European forests are subject to a variety of anthropogenic influences-including
  direct management, nitrogen deposition and availability (Kinney and Lindroth,
  1997), sulfur emission (Posch et al., 1996; Slovik, 1996), ozone injury, and
  changes caused by unbalanced game populations. These factors are likely to interact
  with climatic change to bring about a complex series of responses that will
  differ from place to place (Thornley and Cannel, 1996; Bugman, 1997; Young,
  1997). Many studies have failed to take such interactions into account; this
  limitation should be considered when interpreting the results (Innes, 1994).
  There is some evidence, however, that the biomass of northern forests was growing
  during the last decades (Houghton, 1996; Lakida et al., 1997; Lelyakin et al.,
  1997; Myneni, 1997). </p>
<p>The interactions between a general increase in winter temperature and the occurrence
  of frost damage have been studied in detail. The timing of budburst is triggered
  by temperature; it is a function of the chilling requirement and the critical
  temperature sum (although precipitation, photoperiod, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and
  the nutritional status of the tree also may play roles). There are differences
  in the timing of budburst between species, between genotypes, and between phenotypes.
  Consequently, some models have predicted an increase in frost injury, such as
  in central and northern Finland (Bach, 1987; Kellom�ki et al., 1995), whereas
  others-such as that developed by Kramer (1994) for The Netherlands and Germany-suggest
  less injury. In Britain, Murray et al. (1989) have suggested that there may
  be no change in frost injury at lowland sites and an increase at upland sites
  for some species. There is likely to be considerable flexibility in budburst
  within a given population, providing some capacity for adaptation to climate
  change (Beuker, 1994). Because increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations may delay budburst,
  there appears to be an antagonistic effect between rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations
  and temperatures that may reduce the increase in frost risk for some species
  in some areas (Murray et al., 1994). </p>
<p>The climatic changes that have been modeled are likely to have considerable
  direct and indirect impacts on plantation forests in Europe. Proe et al. (1996)
  have suggested, on the basis of an ecophysiological process model, that the
  general yield class (GYC) of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong) Carri�re)
  in Scotland would increase by 2.8 m<sup>3</sup>/ha/yr for each 1�C rise in temperature.
  This estimate was based on a uniform increase in temperature throughout the
  year. If there were greater warming during winter months, the GYC increase was
  2.4 m<sup>3</sup>/ha/yr. The reduction is attributable to the negative correlation between
  winter temperature and growth rate in this species, which is believed to be
  caused by the increased activities of pests in warmer winters and the winter
  chilling requirements of the species. Similar negative relationships between
  GYC and winter temperature have been identified in Scotland for Douglas fir
  (Pseudotsuga menziesii F. Mirb.) and Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), but
  not for Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi (L.) Carri�re) (Tyler et al., 1996).
  The winter chilling requirement seems to be a major factor in determining the
  distribution of many tree species (Sykes et al., 1996). </p>
<p>The land area capable of supporting Sitka spruce with a GYC of more than 18
  m<sup>3</sup>/ha/yr in Scotland is expected to double within 20 years and to show a similar
  increase during the subsequent 40 years (Proe et al., 1996). The model did not
  include potential effects of increased CO<sub>2</sub> because these effects are considered
  less important for growth responses than changes in temperature (Prentice et
  al., 1991; Luxmoore et al., 1993). </p>
<p>Similar changes in yield have been predicted in Finnish forests (Kellom�ki
  and Kolstr�m, 1994), although the nature of the changes varies with latitude.
  Yield increases for Scotch pine, silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and downy
  birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) were predicted with increasing temperatures,
  with the increases being greater in northern Finland than in the southern part
  of the country. The productivity of Norway spruce was predicted to decrease
  in the south but to increase substantially in the north. These changes did not
  take into account any changes in precipitation, the nature of which remains
  uncertain. However, other modeling work (Talkkari and Hyp�n, 1996) has suggested
  that any effects of precipitation changes are likely to be much less important
  than the effects of temperature changes, mainly because of the morainic soils
  (which tend to retain moisture) that predominate over much of northern Scandinavia.
  On sandy soils in southern Finland, soil moisture deficits may become a problem
  under future climatic scenarios (Kellom�ki, 1995; Kellom�ki and V�is�nen, 1996).
</p>
<p>There is considerable evidence that predicted changes in yield already are
  occurring in European forests (Spiecker et al., 1996). No systematic studies
  have been undertaken, but growth increases have been recorded in forests in
  Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Slovenia, Sweden, and Switzerland, with possible
  increases also occurring in Portugal and Spain. The causes of these growth increases
  were not evaluated, although climatic change, increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations,
  increased nitrogen deposition, and changes in management practices were cited
  as possible causes. </p>
