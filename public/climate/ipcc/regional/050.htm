<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>In the recent geologic past, the tundra was a carbon sink. Recent climatic
  warming in the Arctic, coupled with the concomitant drying of the active layer
  and the lowering of the water table, has shifted areas of the Arctic from sinks
  to sources of CO<sub>2</sub> (Oechel et al., 1993). Extrapolating results from the Alaskan
  tundra to the circumpolar Arctic, regional warming could have caused a net flux
  from the land to the atmosphere of about 0.2 GtC/yr during the 1980s (IPCC 1996,
  WG I, Section 9.2.3.1). However, unpublished evidence from the Land-Atmosphere-Ice-Interactions
  component of ARCSS indicates that there may be substantial interannual variability
  in the source-sink relationship of Arctic tundra. This concern is reinforced
  by recent study by Myneni et al. (1997). Loss of a sizable portion of more than
  50 Gt of carbon in Arctic soils and 450 Gt of carbon in soils of all tundra
  ecosystems could cause an appreciable positive feedback on the atmospheric rise
  of CO<sub>2</sub> (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.4.3). It should be noted, however, that
  the preceding projections are based on an assessment for all high-latitude ecosystems,
  not just the tundra, and could be misleading as an indication of the potential
  for tundra ecosystems to act as a positive feedback. In addition, Schimel et
  al. (1994) and McGuire et al. (1995) have modeled the temperature sensitivity
  of soil carbon responses and find levels much less than 450 GtC. </p>
<p>Enhanced decomposition of soil organic matter leads to the release of trace
  gases and feedbacks on the global climate. A change in total CH4 flux from Arctic
  wetlands can be expected if the areal extent of wetlands changes, the duration
  of the active period changes, or the per-unit-area production or oxidation of
  CH4 changes (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 6.3.3.2.2). The limited available data
  for the CH4 content of permafrost has substantial variability. High CH4 concentrations
  in ice-bonded sediments and gas releases suggest that pore-space hydrate may
  be found at depths as shallow as 119 m. These data raise the possibility that
  gas hydrates could occur at much shallower depths and may be more rapidly influenced
  by climate change than previously thought (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.4.3).
</p>
<p>In Antarctica, the terrestrial ecosystem is comparatively simple, constrained
  by an exposed land area that is very cold. Only 2% of the Antarctic surface
  is not covered by ice. This limited regime is mostly rocky areas where the temperature
  is below freezing except for periods of a few days or weeks during the Austral
  summer. These "Antarctic oases" provide a natural laboratory for assessing the
  vulnerability and response of this ecosystem to climate change. The mainland
  plays host to a number of microscopic plants that are found mainly in crevices
  and cavities of exposed rocks. Even the poorly developed soil of Antarctica
  harbors bacteria, algae, yeast and other fungi, lichens, and even moss spore
  (though usually in a dormant stage). The coastal region is particularly hospitable
  to the vegetation of lichens and mosses. Meltwater in the area helps to support
  herbaceous species such as grass. Some species of invertebrates survive in the
  harsh environment by super-cooling or anhydrobiosis mechanisms (Walton and Bonner,
  1985). The Dry Valley's environmental conditions resemble those on Mars; this
  area is one of the world's most extreme desert regions. It was formed by the
  advances and retreats of glaciers through the coastal mountain ranges. The ecosystem
  there consists of microorganisms, microinvertebrates, mosses, and lichens. Climate
  change will impact on the physiology, distribution, and species composition
  of this terrestrial ecosystem. </p>
<h4>3.3.4. Freshwater and Marine Ecological Systems<a name="freshwater"></a> </h4>
<p>The ranges of many species in lakes and streams are likely to shift poleward
  by about 150 km for every 1°C increase in air temperature (IPCC 1996, WG II,
  Technical Summary, Section 3.3.1). This axiom is not useful for extrapolation
  in oceanic waters. If global warming effects continue, the sea surface temperature
  increases would be about 3°C in the North Pacific in 50 years. This change represents
  the same effect that would be seen in a present isotherm shift northward of
  about 500 km in mid-latitudes (Kim, 1995). Climate change or regime shifts might
  change distribution, species composition, and productivity in the North Pacific
  as well as adjacent subarctic areas. </p>
<p>Water temperatures have a direct impact on the productivity of fish species
  and the relative abundance of different fish species. Climatic changes are likely
  to affect not only water temperatures but also salinity and seasonal water cycles.
  Temperature influences biological production and can have a profound effect
  on growth and metabolic processes. Observations show that biological rates double
  or halve with a 10°C increase or decrease in temperature, respectively. Over
  the range of temperatures encountered in the ocean (-2 to +30°C), maximum growth
  rates of plankton vary by about a factor of 10. At high latitudes, where the
  temperature range is smaller (-2 to +3°C), temperature changes may have a relatively
  larger effect. Even small changes in temperature could have pronounced effects
  on biological rates of growth and development. Further, glacial meltwater is
  known to affect the nearshore zonation of Antarctic marine invertebrates (Berkman,
  1994) and increased meltwater production may further impact species in the Antarctic
  coastal zone. Climate impacts on long-lived benthic invertebrate species such
  as sponges and some calcareous species, some of which have decadal and perhaps
  century-long lifespans, are unknown. </p>
<p>Greenhouse warming of the troposphere would be accompanied by cooling of the
  stratosphere. Changes in the stratospheric ozone layer have occurred over both
  the Arctic and the Antarctic. In the Antarctic, the occurrence of a persistent
  stratospheric ozone hole occurs during the spring and is due to ozone-depleting
  substances, including chlorofluorocarbons. The low human and species populations
  in the Antarctic have limited the biological damage, although there is evidence
  that significant changes in ecosystem function could occur. In the Arctic, where
  considerably more biological activity may be affected, ozone depletion and increased
  uv radiation have been observed over the past decade. Ozone depletion has occurred
  both as a steady decline and also with short, isolated areas of very low ozone
  (Weatherhead and Morseth, 1997). Climate change may further ozone depletion.
  The cooling of the stratosphere is likely to increase this depletion with current
  chlorine loading. However, chlorine loading can be expected to decline considerably
  in the future. Some of the episodes of low ozone observed in the Arctic are
  not associated with chemical depletion but are due to the influx of low-ozone
  air from lower latitudes (Taalas, 1993; Taalas et al., 1995). Whether these
  episodes will increase or decrease will depend on stratospheric circulation
  patterns near the Arctic; thus, it also may be influenced by climate changes.
  The chemically induced and the dynamically induced episodes of low ozone occurring
  in the Arctic both appear to be increasing in frequency and severity (Taalas
  et al., 1997; Weatherhead and Morseth, 1997). These depletion events are most
  prevalent in the spring, when biological activity is highly sensitive to UV-B
  radiation. Increased levels are likely to affect the human populations as well
  as the aquatic and terrestrial species and ecosystems (Taalas, 1993; SCOPE,
  1996). </p>
<p>Sea ice is important in the development and sustenance of temperate-to-polar
  ecosystems. Ice conditions conducive to ice-edge primary production provide
  a primary food source in polar ecosystems. Ice-dependent activities of organisms
  ensure energy transfer from primary producers (algae and phytoplankton) to higher
  trophic levels (fish, marine birds, and mammals). As a consequence, the ice-dependent
  habitat maintains and supports abundant biological communities (IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Section 8.3.2). </p>
