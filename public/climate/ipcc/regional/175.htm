<p><b>Ecosystems: Forested</b> (<a href="191.htm">Section 8.3.2</a>). Changes
  are likely in the growth and regeneration capacity of forests in many subregions.
  In some cases, this process will alter the function and composition of forests
  significantly. </p>
<p><i>Forests may die or decline in density in some regions because of drought,
  pest infestations, and fire; in other regions, forests may increase in both
  area and density</i>. Models suggest that total potential forest area could
  increase by as much as 25-44%. For some individual forest types, however, range
  expansions could be preceded by decline or dieback over 19-96% of their area
  while the climate and ecosystems are adjusting, but before an equilibrium is
  attained. Even though total forest area could increase, northward shifts in
  distribution could produce losses in forest area in the United States. </p>
<p><i>Geographic ranges of forest ecosystems are expected to shift northward and
  upward in altitude, but forests cannot move across the land surface as rapidly
  as climate is projected to change</i>. The faster the rate of climate change,
  the greater the probability of ecosystem disruption and species extinction.
  Climate-induced dieback could begin within a few decades from the present and
  might be enhanced by increases in pest infestations and fire. Alternatively,
  forest growth might increase in the early stages of global warming, followed
  by drought-induced forest dieback after higher temperatures have significantly
  increased evaporative demand. Migration into colder areas may be limited by
  seed dispersal (e.g., barriers may exist because of urbanization and changing
  land-use patterns), seedling establishment, and poor soils. As forests expand
  or contract in response to climate change, they will likely either replace or
  be replaced by savannas, shrublands, or grasslands. Imbalances between rates
  of expansion and contraction could result in a large pulse of carbon to the
  atmosphere during the transition. </p>
<p><i>Longer fire seasons and potentially more frequent and larger fires are likely</i>.
  Because of decades of fire suppression-resulting in higher forest densities
  and increased transpiration-forests in the continental interior are experiencing
  increased drought stress; pest infestations; and catastrophic, stand-replacing
  fires, potentially resulting in changes in species composition. Future climate
  could result in longer fire seasons and potentially more frequent and larger
  fires in all forest zones (even those that currently do not support much fire),
  due to more severe fire weather, changes in fire management practices, and possible
  forest decline or dieback. </p>
<p><b>Hydrology and Water Resources</b> (<a href="199.htm">Section 8.3.3</a>).
  Water is a linchpin that integrates many subregions and sectors. Water quantity
  and quality will be directly affected by climate change. Available water supplies
  also will be affected by changes in demand from multiple sectors competing for
  water resources. Changes in the hydrological cycle will cause changes in ecosystems-which
  will, in turn, affect human health (e.g., by altering the geographic distribution
  of infectious diseases) and biological diversity. </p>
<p><i>Increases or decreases in annual runoff could occur over much of the lower
  latitudes and in midcontinental regions of mid and high latitudes</i>. Increases
  in temperature lead to a rise in evapotranspiration-which, unless offset by
  large increases in precipitation or decreases in plant water use, results in
  declines in runoff, lake levels, and groundwater recharge and levels. The greatest
  impact of declines in supply will be in arid and semi-arid regions and in areas
  with a high ratio of use relative to available renewable supply, as well as
  in basins with multiple competing uses. Alternatively, regions that experience
  substantial increases in precipitation are likely to have substantial increases
  in runoff and river flows. </p>
<p><i>Climate projections suggest increased runoff in winter and early spring
  but reduced flows during summer in regions in which hydrology is dominated by
  snowmelt. Glaciers are expected to retreat, and their contributions to summer
  flows will decline as peak flows shift to winter or early spring</i>. In mountainous
  regions, particularly at mid-elevations, warming leads to a long-term reduction
  in peak snow-water equivalent; the snowpack builds later and melts sooner. Snow-
  or glacier-fed river and reservoir systems that supply spring and summer flow
  during the critical periods of high agricultural and municipal demand and low
  precipitation may tend to release their water earlier in the year, which would
  reduce supplies during summer droughts. Water supplies and water quality, irrigation,
  hydroelectric generation, tourism, and fish habitat, as well as the viability
  of the livestock industry, may be negatively impacted. The Great Plains of the
  United States and prairie regions of Canada and California are particularly
  vulnerable. </p>
<p><i>Altered precipitation and temperature regimes may cause lower lake levels,
  especially in midcontinental regions and, along with the seasonal pattern and
  variability of water levels of wetlands, thereby affect their functioning-including
  flood protection, water filtration, carbon storage, and waterfowl/ wildlife
  habitat</i>. The response of an affected wetland varies; it might include migration
  along river edges or the slope of a receding lake and/or altered vegetation
  species composition. Long-term lake levels would decline to or below historic
  low levels in the Great Lakes under several climate change scenarios. Prairie
  pothole lakes and sloughs may dry out more frequently in the north-central regions
  of North America. These wetlands currently yield 50-75% of all waterfowl produced
  annually in North America. In the Mackenzie delta of arctic Canada, many lakes
  could disappear in several decades because of decreased flood frequency and
  less precipitation. </p>
<p><i>Ice-jam patterns are likely to be altered</i>. In New England, the Atlantic
  provinces, the Great Lakes, and central Plains areas, as well as northern regions
  susceptible to spring flooding, changes in late winter-early spring precipitation
  patterns could result in diminished frequency of ice jams and flooding. Damages
  caused by these events currently are estimated to cost Canadians CAN$60 million
  and Americans US$100 million annually, though northern deltas and wetlands appear
  to depend on the resulting periodic recharge. Depending on the specific pattern
  of altering climate, mid-latitude areas where ice jams presently are uncommon-such
  as the prairies; central Ontario and Quebec; and parts of Maine, New Brunswick,
  Newfoundland, and Labrador-may suffer from an increase in frequency and/or severity
  of winter breakup and associated jamming. </p>
