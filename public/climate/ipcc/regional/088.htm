<h1>4.4. Integrated Analysis of Potential Impacts </h1>
<p><i>Summary: Some preliminary studies of impacts for limited areas or issues
  have been attempted for the region, but comprehensive integrated analyses are
  not available. A cross-sector economic costing approach indicates substantial
  impacts on Australasia's GDP (several percent per annum for a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>),
  but the method involved is subject to considerable criticism. The New Zealand
  CLIMPACTS and Australian OzClim software packages have been developed as national-scale,
  integrated assessment methodologies to enable the progressive exploration of
  sensitivities, impacts, adaptation options, and so forth as knowledge develops.
  </i></p>
<p><i>Research is needed on better climate scenarios; the dynamic responses of
  ecological systems; impacts on marine, aquatic, and coastal ecosystems; possible
  changes in the magnitude and frequency of "natural disasters"; impacts on settlements,
  industries, and health; cross-sector and multinational interactions; and potential
  adaptations and their ameliorating effects. </i></p>
<p><i>In summary, Australia's relatively low latitude makes it particularly vulnerable
  through impacts on its scarce water resources and on crops presently growing
  near or above their optimum temperatures, whereas New Zealand-a cooler, wetter,
  mid-latitude country-may gain some benefit from the ready availability of suitable
  crops and the likely increased agricultural production. In both countries, however,
  there is a wide range of situations in which vulnerability is thought to be
  moderate to high-particularly in ecosystems, hydrology, coastal zones, settlements
  and industry, and health. </i></p>
<p>A comprehensive integrated analysis of impacts for the region is not possible
  at present, mainly because of the large uncertainties in each of the three stages
  of analysis: first, in the magnitude and direction of change in the climate
  elements; second, in the estimations of potential impacts for individual components
  of systems; and third, concerning possible interactions between components.
  Instead, we discuss preliminary attempts to develop integrated assessment methodologies
  and present results from two case studies. </p>
<p>Integrated assessments of climate change are attempts to integrate three components
  or dimensions of the problem (Weyant et al., 1996; IPCC 1996, WG III, Chapter
  10): </p>
<ul>
  <li>The chain of effects, from changes in atmospheric composition and climate
    to changes in biophysical systems to socioeconomic consequences (the "vertical"
    dimension)</li>
  <li>The interactions between systems, sectors, and activities (the "horizontal"
    dimension)</li>
  <li>The context of other trends and changes in society, such as population,
    technology, land-use, and economics (the "time" dimension).</li>
</ul>
<p>New Zealand was one of the first countries in the world to carry out such an
  assessment of the effects of climate change at the national scale, based on
  the work of expert panels and integrated through a national committee (Mosley,
  1990a). In Australia, the idea of integrated climate impact assessments has
  been developed, to some extent, in the context of climatic variability rather
  than climate change, to better adapt Australian agriculture to the large year-to-year
  climatic variability associated with ENSO fluctuations. Collaborative projects
  involving climatologists, agricultural scientists, rural economists, and stakeholders
  have led to the development of crop-, farm-, and industry-level models that
  facilitate the application of ENSO-derived seasonal climate forecasting to improve
  farm and industry management (Stone et al., 1993; BRS, 1994; Stafford Smith
  et al., 1994). The ability to better predict and manage this short-term climate
  variability is itself an important adaptation tool. </p>
<p>Two initial efforts at integrated assessment in Australia are described in
  <a href="068.htm#box4-1">Box 4-1</a>, on the impacts of climate change on the
  management of the scarce water resources of the Macquarie River basin in northern
  NSW, and in <a href="#box4-2">Box 4-2</a>, on the impacts of climate change
  on the cattle tick. <br>

      <p>Sutherst et al. (1996) carried out an integrated assessment of the national
	socioeconomic impact of climate change on the cattle tick (Boophilus microplus),
	which is an important parasite of cattle in northern Australia. There
	is concern that global warming will result in a spread of ticks and an
	increase in their numbers, as indicated by an earlier study for both New
	Zealand and Australia (Sutherst et al., 1996). The cattle tick causes
	losses in productivity through feeding in large numbers and by transmitting
	a blood pathogen that causes high rates of mortality in nonimmune cattle.
	The southern limit of the ticks currently is maintained by a quarantine
	and eradication program at the border between NSW and Queensland, at a
	cost of several million dollars per year. </p>
      <p>A population model of the cattle tick was used first to estimate current
	national losses of productivity of beef cattle due to the ticks in each
	part of the country. These impacts were costed using an economic model
	of the cattle industry, after which the exercise was repeated using the
	changed climate scenarios derived from the CSIRO9 global climate model
	(experiment F1, <a href="003.htm#table1-1">Table 1-1</a>). Potential costs
	were estimated on the basis that the quarantine line would not be economically
	sustainable because of the recurrent development of strains of ticks that
	are resistant to the chemicals used to control them and the increasing
	difficulty of eradication under more favorable climatic conditions. </p>
      <p>The maps in the accompanying graphic illustrate the estimated potential
	costs under current and 2070 climate scenarios. The number of ticks was
	estimated to increase in the southern part of the existing range-where
	they are limited by the shortness of the warm season, which allows reproduction,
	and by severe winter mortality. Both of these constraints were reduced
	by global warming; as a result, most of the estimated increases in costs
	would be sustained within the current tick-infested area in Queensland.
	There was a parallel increase in the potential area affected by ticks
	in NSW. The final estimates of potential national costs, in terms of net
	present value, ranged from A$18 million to A$192 million, but these estimates
	will vary with discount rates. </p>
      <p>The analysis was unique in Australia in that it was one of the first
	to use a fully integrated hierarchical approach to assessing impacts of
	climate change on pests, diseases, and weeds, including climate change
	scenarios generated by CSIRO; simulation of the target species (ticks)
	with a population model; and calculation of economic impacts on the national
	beef industry, estimated using a beef industry model developed by the
	Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. To achieve these
	objectives, an interdisciplinary team of climate modellers, ecologists,
	and economists was needed. The results are available at <a target="_top" href="http://www.modeling.ctpm.uq.edu.au/dest_public/">http://www.modeling.ctpm.uq.edu.au/dest_public/</a>

<p>
  These integrated assessments in Australia and New Zealand are subject, however,
  to large uncertainties arising from continually evolving GCM-based scenarios
  of regional climate change. Indeed, the remarkable contrast between the rainfall
  change scenarios for Australia (and also by implication for New Zealand-see
  <a href="064.htm">Section 4.2.3</a>) emerging from simulations using slab-ocean
  GCMs and from the more comprehensive coupled-ocean models (Whetton et al., 1996a)
  has increased the uncertainty regarding the "correct" scenario to use in impact
  analyses (CSIRO, 1996a) and has thrown considerable doubt on the predictions
  of many early impact studies (though they remain valuable as sensitivity studies).
  As a consequence, there is a growing recognition that integrated assessments
  for Australia and New Zealand need to be carried out within a versatile framework
  that allows the range of uncertainties to be explored and the effects of changing
  scenarios (due to scientific, economic, or policy changes) to be readily assessed
  in an iterative fashion. For this approach, integrated models are required.
</p>
<p>Methods for integrated assessment have been explored at several recent workshops
  involving Australian and New Zealand participants (Pittock and Mitchell, 1994;
  Braaf et al., 1995; Hennessy and Pittock, 1996a, b). In New Zealand, a major
  research program known as CLIMPACTS has been under way since 1993, involving
  more than seven different laboratories (Kenny et al., 1995; Warrick et al.,
  1996). This project has coupled the MAGICC model (Wigley, 1994)-which generates
  a global average warming curve for given input assumptions-to a regional pattern
  of climate change per 1�C global warming, which is based on a range of GCM simulations
  and local statistical interpolation techniques. A number of impacts models are
  now being coupled to this framework, in order to examine the sensitivity of
  the New Zealand environment to climate variability and change. First-order impacts
  and sensitivities have been assessed for grain maize, pasture, wheat, and kiwifruit.
</p>
<p>In Australia, CSIRO has begun developing an Australian version of CLIMPACTS
  called OzClim (CSIRO, 1996b). This is part of a broad-based climate impacts
  "tool kit" that has been adopted as a goal of the CSIRO Climate and Atmosphere
  Sector. A comprehensive model for assessing the effect of climate change on
  pests and diseases also has been applied in Australia (Sutherst, 1995; Sutherst
  et al., 1996) and could be part of an impacts tool kit. </p>
