<h4>8.3.4.5. Yield and Production Changes by North American Subregion</h4>
<p>Previous studies that have simulated the impact of climate change on the North
  American agriculture sector have taken a variety of approaches. Tables 13-11
  and 13-12 in the SAR (IPCC 1996, WG II) outline the range and variability of
  yield impacts that have been suggested across a number of studies looking at
  climate change impacts for the United States and Canada. For these studies (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 13.6.8), when biophysical and economic impacts were combined,
  market adjustments were found to lessen the impacts of negative yield changes.
  More recent projections of increases in global mean surface temperatures in
  the future are lower than past estimates. These lower estimates are derived
  from new, transient GCM scenarios that take into account the interactions between
  the atmosphere and oceans and the cooling effects of sulfate and other aerosols
  in the troposphere (Darwin, 1997). Most of the impact studies currently available
  for review have not utilized the projections from these more recent climate
  model simulations as a background; as a result, they may overestimate the magnitude
  of expected temperature impacts. </p>
<p>The outcome of the net economic impact summarized in the SAR (IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Section 13.6.8) was sensitive to assumptions about population, income, trade
  barriers, and institutions and ranged from negative to positive. For Canada,
  the vulnerability of the agricultural sector derives from the importance of
  agriculture to subregional (e.g., the prairies) and rural economies, the location
  of agriculture in a marginal climate with regard to temperature and precipitation,
  and limitations to northward shifting of cropping by poor soil quality (Cohen
  et al., 1992). </p>
<p><i>Economic welfare may improve for more northerly farm production regions-with
  potential benefits indicated for the lake states, the northern Plains, the mountain
  region, and the Pacific region.</i> </p>
<p>Evaluation of the direct and indirect effects of climate on yield at the farm,
  regional, or higher level of aggregation requires integrated models that consider
  system interactions. Changes in crop production, crop water demand, and regional
  water resources will arise as a consequence of climate change, although the
  impacts of these changes on agriculture will be modified by trends in world
  food production and commodity exports. These interactions can be modeled to
  estimate the economic consequences of climate change for regions of the United
  States. Adams et al. (1995a,b) used three GCM scenarios to evaluate the economic
  consequences to crop production and regional welfare if climate changes of similar
  magnitude were to occur. <a href="#figure8-8">Figure 8-8</a> illustrates the
  subregional variability in economic welfare suggested by climate change, including
  a CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effect (and accounting for changes in export demand). Based
  on these analyses, eastern, southeastern, and corn belt regions yielded estimates
  of negative impacts, while positive effects were projected for northern plains
  and western regions. <br>
