<h1>Ecosystems</h1>
<p>Ecosystems are of fundamental importance to environmental function and to sustainability,
  and they provide many goods and services critical to individuals and societies.
  These goods and services include: (i) providing food, fiber, fodder, shelter,
  medicines, and energy; (ii) processing and storing carbon and nutrients; (iii)
  assimilating wastes; (iv) purifying water, regulating water runoff, and moderating
  floods; (v) building soils and reducing soil degradation; (vi) providing opportunities
  for recreation and tourism; and (vii) housing the Earth's entire reservoir of
  genetic and species diversity. In addition, natural ecosystems have cultural,
  religious, aesthetic, and intrinsic existence values. Changes in climate have
  the potential to affect the geographic location of ecological systems, the mix
  of species that they contain, and their ability to provide the wide range of
  benefits on which societies rely for their continued existence. Ecological systems
  are intrinsically dynamic and are constantly influenced by climate variability.
  The primary influence of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems is expected
  to be through the rate and magnitude of change in climate means and extremes-climate
  change is expected to occur at a rapid rate relative to the speed at which ecosystems
  can adapt and reestablish themselves-and through the direct effects of increased
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, which may increase the productivity and efficiency
  of water use in some plant species. Secondary effects of climate change involve
  changes in soil characteristics and disturbance regimes (e.g., fires, pests,
  and diseases), which would favor some species over others and thus change the
  species composition of ecosystems. <br>

<p>Based on model simulations of vegetation distribution, which use GCM-based
  climate scenarios, large shifts of vegetation boundaries into higher latitudes
  and elevations can be expected. The mix of species within a given vegetation
  class likely will change. Under equilibrium GCM climate scenarios, large regions
  show drought-induced declines in vegetation, even when the direct effects of
  CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization are included. By comparison, under transient climate scenarios-in
  which trace gases increase slowly over a period of years-the full effects of
  changes in temperature and precipitation lag the effects of a change in atmospheric
  composition by a number of decades; hence, the positive effects of CO<sub>2</sub> precede
  the full effects of changes in climate. </p>
<p>Climate change is projected to occur at a rapid rate relative to the speed
  at which forest species grow, reproduce, and reestablish themselves (past tree
  species' migration rates are believed to be on the order of 4-200 km per century).
  For mid-latitude regions, an average warming of 1-3.5ï¿½C over the next 100 years
  would be equivalent to a poleward shift of the present geographic bands of similar
  temperatures (or "isotherms") approximately 150-550 km, or an altitude shift
  of about 150-550 m. Therefore, the species composition of forests is likely
  to change; in some regions, entire forest types may disappear, while new assemblages
  of species and hence new ecosystems may be established. As a consequence of
  possible changes in temperature and water availability under doubled equivalent-CO<sub>2</sub>
  equilibrium conditions, a substantial fraction (a global average of one-third,
  varying by region from one-seventh to two-thirds) of the existing forested area
  of the world likely would undergo major changes in broad vegetation types-with
  the greatest changes occurring in high latitudes and the least in the tropics.
  In tropical rangelands, major alterations in productivity and species composition
  would occur due to altered rainfall amount and seasonality and increased evapotranspiration,
  although a mean temperature increase alone would not lead to such changes. </p>
<p>Inland aquatic ecosystems will be influenced by climate change through altered
  water temperatures, flow regimes, water levels, and thawing of permafrost at
  high latitudes. In lakes and streams, warming would have the greatest biological
  effects at high latitudes-where biological productivity would increase and lead
  to expansion of cool-water species' ranges-and at the low-latitude boundaries
  of cold- and cool-water species ranges, where extinctions would be greatest.
  Increases in flow variability, particularly the frequency and duration of large
  floods and droughts, would tend to reduce water quality, biological productivity,
  and habitat in streams. The geographical distribution of wetlands is likely
  to shift with changes in temperature and precipitation, with uncertain implications
  for net greenhouse gas emissions from non-tidal wetlands. Some coastal ecosystems
  (saltwater marshes, mangrove ecosystems, coastal wetlands, coral reefs, coral
  atolls, and river deltas) are particularly at risk from climate change and other
  stresses. Changes in these ecosystems would have major negative effects on freshwater
  supplies, fisheries, biodiversity, and tourism. </p>
<p>Adaptation options for ecosystems are limited, and their effectiveness is uncertain.
  Options include establishment of corridors to assist the "migration" of ecosystems,
  land-use management, plantings, and restoration of degraded areas. Because of
  the projected rapid rate of change relative to the rate at which species can
  reestablish themselves, the isolation and fragmentation of many ecosystems,
  the existence of multiple stresses (e.g., land-use change, pollution), and limited
  adaptation options, ecosystems (especially forested systems, montane systems,
  and coral reefs) are vulnerable to climate change. </p>
<h1>Hydrology and Water Resources<a name="hydro"></a></h1>
<p>Water availability is an essential component of welfare and productivity. Currently,
  1.3 billion people do not have access to adequate supplies of safe water, and
  2 billion people do not have access to adequate sanitation. Although these people
  are dispersed throughout the globe-reflecting sub-national variations in water
  availability and quality-some 19 countries (primarily in the Middle East and
  north and southern Africa) face such severe shortfalls that they are classified
  as either water-scarce or water-stressed; this number is expected to roughly
  double by 2025, in large part because of increases in demand resulting from
  economic and population growth. For example, most policy makers now recognize
  drought as a recurrent feature of Africa's climate. However, climate change
  will further exacerbate the frequency and magnitude of droughts in some places.
</p>
<p>Changes in climate could exacerbate periodic and chronic shortfalls of water,
  particularly in arid and semi-arid areas of the world. Developing countries
  are highly vulnerable to climate change because many are located in arid and
  semi-arid regions, and most derive their water resources from single-point systems
  such as bore holes or isolated reservoirs. These systems, by their nature, are
  vulnerable because there is no redundancy in the system to provide resources,
  should the primary supply fail. Also, given the limited technical, financial,
  and management resources possessed by developing countries, adjusting to shortages
  and/or implementing adaptation measures will impose a heavy burden on their
  national economies. There is evidence that flooding is likely to become a larger
  problem in many temperate and humid regions, requiring adaptations not only
  to droughts and chronic water shortages but also to floods and associated damages,
  raising concerns about dam and levee failures. </p>
<p>The impacts of climate change will depend on the baseline condition of the
  water supply system and the ability of water resources managers to respond not
  only to climate change but also to population growth and changes in demands,
  technology, and economic, social, and legislative conditions. </p>
<p>Various approaches are available to reduce the potential vulnerability of water
  systems to climate change. Options include pricing systems, water efficiency
  initiatives, engineering and structural improvements to water supply infrastructure,
  agriculture policies, and urban planning/management. At the national/regional
  level, priorities include placing greater emphasis on integrated, cross-sectoral
  water resources management, using river basins as resource management units,
  and encouraging sound pricing and management practices. Given increasing demands,
  the prevalence and sensitivity of many simple water management systems to fluctuations
  in precipitation and runoff, and the considerable time and expense required
  to implement many adaptation measures, the water resources sector in many regions
  and countries is vulnerable to potential changes in climate. </p>
