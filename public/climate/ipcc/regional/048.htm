<h4>3.3.2. Permafrost, Hydrology, and Water Resources </h4>
<p>Permafrost-ground material that remains below freezing-underlies as much as
  25% of the global land surface, including all of Antarctica and virtually all
  of the Arctic (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.1). In continental areas in the tundra,
  as well as some boreal lands, it extends to considerable depths. It also is
  present under shallow polar seabeds, in ice-free areas in Antarctica, on some
  sub-Antarctic islands, and in many mountain ranges and high plateaus of the
  world (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.2.3). Ice-rich permafrost may contain up
  to twice as much (frozen) water as the same soil in a thawed state (IPCC 1996,
  WG I, Section 7.3.4). It forms an impervious layer to deep infiltration of water,
  maintaining high water tables and poorly aerated soils. </p>
<p>By the year 2050, increases are expected in the thickness of the active layer
  of permafrost and in the loss of extensive areas of discontinuous permafrost
  in Arctic and sub-Arctic areas. Major changes in the volume and extent of deep,
  continuous permafrost are unlikely because it is very cold and reacts with longer
  time lags (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 7 Executive Summary). </p>
<p>In areas of good drainage, significant increases in active layer depth or loss
  of permafrost are expected to cause drying of upper soil layers in most regions.
</p>
<p>Widespread loss of permafrost will trigger erosion or subsidence of ice-rich
  landscapes (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 7 Executive Summary). A critical factor
  influencing the response of tundra to warming is the presence of ground ice.
  Ground ice generally is concentrated in the upper 10 m of permafrost-the very
  layers that will thaw first as permafrost degrades. This loss is effectively
  irreversible because once the ground ice melts, it cannot be replaced for millennia,
  even if the climate were to cool subsequently. The response of the permafrost
  landscape to warming will be profound, but it also will vary greatly at the
  local scale, depending on ground-ice content. As substantial ice in permafrost
  is melted, there will be land subsidence. This process of thermokarst erosion
  in lowland areas will create many ponds and lakes and lead to coastal retreat
  and inland erosion (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.5). These physical changes will
  result in major changes in ecosystem structure and landscape in the interior
  land masses of the sub-Arctic. </p>
<p>Peatlands will be extremely vulnerable to climate change if warmer temperatures
  lead to a thawing of the permafrost layer and affect their hydrology through
  changes in surface elevation, drainage, or flooding. These wetlands have a limited
  capacity to adapt to climate change because it is unlikely that new permafrost
  areas will form (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 6.3.1). Permafrost is the key factor,
  generally, in maintaining high water tables in these peatland ecosystems (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Chapter 7 Executive Summary). </p>
<p>A forerunner of future landscapes can be seen in areas of massive ground ice-such
  as in Russia, where past climatic warming has altered the landscape by producing
  extensive flat-bottomed valleys. Ponds within an area of thermokarst topography
  eventually grow into thaw lakes. These lakes continue to enlarge for decades
  to centuries because of wave action and continued thermal erosion of the banks.
  Liquefaction of the thawed layer will result in mudflows on slopes in terrain
  that is poorly drained or contains ice-rich permafrost. On steeper slopes there
  also will be landslides. Winter discharge of groundwater often leads to ice
  formation. This formation is expected to increase on hill slopes and in the
  stream channels of the tundra (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.5). </p>
<p>Climatic warming would likely make notable changes in the hydrology of Arctic
  areas. The nival regime runoff patterns will weaken for many rivers in the permafrost
  region. The pluvial influence upon runoff will intensify for rivers along the
  southern margin of Arctic regions of Eurasia and North America. Should the climate
  continue to warm, the vegetation will likely be different from today. When lichens
  and mosses-which tend to be suppressers of evapotranspiration-are replaced by
  transpiring plants, evaporative losses will increase. Enhanced evaporation will
  lower the water table, which would be followed by changes in the peat characteristics
  as the extensive wetland surfaces become drier (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.5.1).
</p>
<p>Thawing of permafrost deepens the active layer, allowing greater infiltration
  and water storage, especially for rain that falls during the thawed period.
  Warming of the ground also will lead to the formation of unfrozen zones within
  the permafrost that provide porousness to enhance groundwater flow and increase
  chemical weathering and nutrient release. The chemical composition and amount
  of groundwater discharge may be changed as subpermafrost or intrapermafrost
  water is connected to the surface. In autumn and winter, more groundwater should
  be available to maintain baseflow, further extending the stream-flow season.
  With earlier snowmelt, the seasonality of river flows will be different (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 7.5.1). Because many of the major river systems are north-flowing
  and cross several climate zones that may respond differently to climate warming,
  predictions are further complicated. </p>
