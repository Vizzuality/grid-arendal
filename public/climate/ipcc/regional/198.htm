<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>All studies agree that where forests are limited by cold they will expand beyond
  current limits, especially to the far north. Whether forests will expand into
  the drier continental interior or contract away from it, however, depends on
  hydrological factors and remains uncertain. Vegetation distribution models that
  incorporate a direct physiological CO<sub>2</sub> effect indicate considerable expansion
  of all forest types into drier and colder areas and much enhanced growth over
  most areas-under the newer climate scenarios as well as some of the older studies.
  Under most of the FAR scenarios with a CO<sub>2</sub> effect and under the SAR scenarios
  without a CO<sub>2</sub> effect, however, forests would contract away from the continental
  interior because of increased drought stress. </p>
<p><i>Longer fire seasons and potentially more frequent and larger fires are likely.</i>
</p>
<p>Fire mediates rapid change and could increase in importance for vegetation
  change. Future climate scenarios could result in longer fire seasons and potentially
  more frequent and larger fires in all forest zones (even those that currently
  do not support much fire) because of more severe fire weather, changes in fire-management
  practices, and possible forest decline or dieback (Fosberg, 1990; Flannigan
  and Van Wagner, 1991; King and Neilson, 1992; Wotton and Flannigan, 1993; Price
  and Rind, 1994; Fosberg et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Fire suppression during much of the 20th century has allowed biomass in many
  interior forests to increase by considerable amounts over historic levels (Agee,
  1990). With increased biomass, forests transpire almost all available soil water;
  they become very sensitive to even small variations in drought stress and are
  very susceptible to catastrophic fire, even without global warming (Neilson
  et al., 1992; Stocks, 1993; Stocks et al., 1996). Forests in the interior of
  North America are experiencing increased frequencies of drought stress; pest
  infestations; and catastrophic, stand-replacing fires (Agee, 1990). This sequence
  of events is a reasonable analog for what could happen to forests over much
  larger areas in the zones projected by biogeography models to undergo a loss
  of biomass or leaf area as a consequence of temperature-induced transpiration
  increases and drought stress (<a href="315.htm">Annex C</a>, <a href="321.htm#figureC-6">Figures
  C-6</a> to <a href="321.htm#figureC-9">C-9</a>; <a href="194.htm#table8-3">Table 8-3</a>)
  (Overpeck et al., 1990; King and Neilson, 1992). </p>
<p><i>Enhanced fire and drought stress will facilitate changes in species composition
  and may increase atmospheric carbon contributions from forests. </i></p>
<p>Given the ownership patterns and remote nature of much of the boreal forest
  lands, they are generally managed as natural systems. Even highly managed temperate
  forests are of such large extent that a rapid, large-scale management response
  would be logistically quite difficult and expensive. </p>
<p>On managed lands, harvesting of dead or dying trees, more rapid harvesting
  or thinning of drought-sensitive trees, and planting of new species could reduce
  or eliminate species loss or productivity declines. However, identification
  of which species to plant (and when) under a rapidly changing climate will be
  difficult management issues. The more rapid the rate of climate change, the
  more it may strain the ability to create infrastructure for seeding or planting
  of trees or support the supply of timber if there is a large amount of salvage.
  The fast rate of warming may limit some species that have slow dispersal rates
  or are constrained by human barriers, habitat fragmentation, or lack of suitable
  habitat-or already are stressed by pollution. </p>
<p>As fire-management agencies operate with increasingly constrained budgets,
  it is likely that any increases in fire frequency or severity will result in
  a disproportionately large increase in area burned (Stocks, 1993). More and
  larger boreal fires will result in a reevaluation of protection priorities,
  with likely increased protection of smaller, high-value areas and reduced protection
  over large expanses. If forests die back from drought, infestations, or fire
  in extensive, remote regions, the impacts could include large-scale changes
  in nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration, as well as loss of value for future
  timber harvests or as habitat for wildlife and biodiversity. Some adaptive practices-such
  as harvesting dead or dying trees or thinning-could impact biodiversity, soil
  erosion, stream quality, and nonmarket forest products, producing potentially
  conflicting management options. </p>
<p>Markham and Malcolm (1996) have concluded that ecological resiliency can be
  increased by conserving biological diversity, reducing fragmentation and degradation
  of habitat, increasing functional connectivity among habitat fragments, and
  reducing anthropogenic environmental stresses. They also indicate that adaptation
  strategies should include redundancy of ecological reserves, reserves with much
  structural heterogeneity, and the flexibility to spatially relocate habitat
  protection depending on shifts in future climate (Peters and Darling, 1985;
  McNeely, 1990). Current habitat fragmentation patterns and human barriers may
  hinder species migration. Thus, management of the "seminatural matrix" may play
  an increasing role in fostering species redistribution (Peters and Darling,
  1985; Bennett et al., 1991; Franklin et al., 1991; Parsons, 1991; Simberloff
  et al., 1992). </p>
