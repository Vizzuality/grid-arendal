<h4>3.3.3. Terrestrial Ecological Systems </h4>
<p>Climate change will affect terrestrial ecological systems through changes in
  permafrost as well as direct climatic changes, including changes in precipitation,
  snow cover, and temperature. Terrestrial ecoystems are likely to change from
  tundra to boreal forests, although vegetative changes are likely to lag climatic
  change. Vegetational ecosystem models suggest that the tundra will decrease
  by as much as one- to two-thirds of its present size (see <a href="315.htm">Annex C</a>). Climate change is expected to occur at a rapid rate relative to the
  speed at which forest species grow, reproduce, and reestablish themselves or
  to their ability to develop appropriate soils. The boreal forest covers approximately
  17% of the world's land surface in a circumpolar complex of forested and partially
  forested ecosystems in northern Eurasia and North America (IPCC 1996, WG II,
  Section 1.6.1). If there is warming, the greatest forest changes are expected
  in high latitudes. Polar projections of this region's terrestrial ecological
  changes (<a href="#figure3-3">Figure 3-3</a>) derived from two different models'
  depictions of the future climate reinforce this conclusion, showing significant
  reduction in the tundra and taiga biomes and expansion of the boreal forest.

  A poleward migration of the northern tree line would decrease winter albedo
  because the tree canopy has much lower albedo than exposed snow surfaces, affecting
  local climate through increased absorption of the sun's incoming energy (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Chapter 6). Large losses are projected in the area of boreal forests
  despite their encroachment into current tundra. Shrinkage in total area because
  of the geographically limited poleward shift leads to a net loss of about 25%
  in boreal coverage (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 1.3.4). On the other hand, vegetative
  ecosystem modeling suggests an expansion in the boreal forest ranging from 108%
  to 133% of the present size (see <a href="315.htm">Annex C</a>). The species
  composition of forests is likely to change; entire forest types may disappear,
  while new assemblages of species, and hence new ecosystems, may be established
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 3.1). The rate of migration is critical, and it is
  likely that the loss from the southern margin will be greater than the gain
  in the northern margin. Projections for habitat changes are presented in <a href="#table3-1">Table
  3-1</a>. <br>

  By 1995, the Arctic contained 285 protected areas covering 2.1 million km<sup>2</sup>
  (UNEP, 1997). There will be considerable impacts of climate change on resource
  management in the tundra (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.5). There is likely to
  be a change in the migration patterns of polar bears and numbers of caribou,
  along with other biological impacts (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.5). High-arctic
  Peary caribou and musk-oxen may become extinct, and barren-ground caribou and
  musk-oxen elsewhere may be reduced (Gunn, 1995). Arctic island caribou migrate
  seasonally across the sea ice between many of the arctic islands in late spring
  and fall; changes in sea ice would disrupt those migrations, with unforeseen
  consequences to population survival and gene flow. </p>
<p>It is also anticipated that small mammals, from lemmings to aquatic furbearers
  (muskrats, beavers, mink), will face ecosystem alterations that will change
  their abundance and distribution. Amphibians and reptiles can be expected to
  increase their range, and the distribution and abundance of hundreds of arthropod
  species will alter. Changes in the timing and abundance of forage availability
  and parasite infestations may accumulate-driving populations into decline, with
  serious consequences for people still depending on them (Jefferies, 1992). Increased
  incidences of forest fires and insect outbreaks are likely, such as already
  observed in Alaska. </p>
<p>Indirect temperature effects associated with changes in tundra thaw depth,
  nutrient availability, and vegetation will cause substantial changes in Arctic
  species composition, litter quality, and nutrient availability. Increased nutrient
  availability increases shrub abundance and decreases the abundance of mosses,
  an important soil insulator (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 2.7.3). </p>
<p>Some alpine and tundra plants have no photoperiod requirements for initiating
  growth and therefore are affected by spring frosts. For example, in northern
  Sweden, increased length of the growing season and increased summer temperature
  will have a significant impact on reproduction and population dynamics in Arctic
  and alpine plants (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 5.2.3.1). Experimental doubling
  of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has relatively little multiyear effect on plant growth
  in Arctic tundra, presumably because of constraints of low nutrient supply (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 2.2.2). </p>
<p>Major shifts in biomes will be associated with changes in microbiological (bacteria,
  algae, etc.) and insect communities. As a consequence, some may diminish while
  others prosper. All microbiologically facilitated processes are strongly affected
  by moisture and temperature. Annual soil respiration rates are likely to increase
  because of the lengthened season for breakdown of plant material and because
  increasing temperature strongly stimulates organic-matter decomposition, especially
  in Arctic regions subject to permafrost (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section A.3.1). </p>
