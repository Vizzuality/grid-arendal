<p><b>Sensitivity, Adaptation, and Vulnerability</b> </p>
<p><b><i>Marine Ecosystems</i></b> </p>
<p>The impact of a climate change-related increase in air temperature on small
  island states has not been investigated in any detail. A rise in temperature
  (of the magnitude projected) is not anticipated to have widespread adverse consequences,
  though some critical ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs) are highly sensitive to
  temperature changes. Although reefs have the potential to keep up or catch up
  with the projected rate of sea-level rise, in many parts of the tropics (e.g.,
  the Caribbean Sea, the Pacific Ocean) some species of corals live near their
  limits of tolerance to temperature (about 25-29ï¿½C). Thus, even relatively small
  projected increases in sea-surface temperature could have an adverse impact
  on the viability of some of these organisms. An increase in the incidence of
  bleaching-associated with the elevation of water temperatures above seasonal
  maxima-similarly would pose a threat to coral reef ecosystems. </p>
<p>The natural capacity of mangroves to adapt and migrate landward in response
  to projected sea-level rise is expected to be reduced by associated land loss,
  land-use practices, and the presence of infrastructure in the coastal zone.
  Survival of mangroves appears likely where the rate of sedimentation approximates
  the local rise in sea level, but landward migration commonly is inhibited by
  topography and infrastructure, which will constrict the mangrove belt. </p>
<p>Some ecosystems already are seriously affected by anthropogenic stresses-which,
  in some islands, may pose as great a threat as climate change itself. Where
  this situation exists, the natural capacity of ecosystems to adapt to the effects
  of climate change will be substantially reduced. </p>
<p><b><i>Coastal Systems</i></b></p>
<p>Many islands are likely to experience increased coastal erosion and land loss
  as a consequence of sea-level rise. Beaches are expected to be affected by a
  reduced supply of sediment from adjacent reefs; on high islands, however, increased
  sediment yields from stream catchments may compensate for this effect, at least
  in the short term. In addition, increased sea flooding and inundation (as have
  been projected for the Marshall Islands and Kiribati) are expected in most low-lying
  islands and atolls. </p>
<p><b><i>Human Settlements and Infrastructure </i></b></p>
<p>In many small island states, the largest settlements, much critical infrastructure,
  and major economic activities and services are located close to present sea
  level and therefore will be at risk from sea-level rise. Vulnerability assessment
  studies have shown that the costs of shoreline and other infrastructure protection
  could be burdensome for some islands. </p>
<p><b><i>Tourism</i></b></p>
<p>Tourism is the dominant economic sector in many small island states in the
  Caribbean Sea and the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This sector is the single largest
  contributor to gross national product (GNP) in many countries. In 1995, for
  example, tourism accounted for 69%, 53%, and 50% of GNP in Antigua, the Bahamas,
  and the Maldives, respectively. The tourism sector also earns considerable foreign
  exchange for a number of small island states, many of which depend heavily on
  imported food, fuel, and a range of other goods and services. For example, in
  1995, the tourist industry in the Maldives earned US$181 million in foreign
  exchange-amounting to more than 70% of the country's total foreign exchange
  earnings for that year. In the Bahamas, the industry earned US$1.3 billion in
  foreign exchange in 1995, which was equivalent to more than 50% of government
  revenues for the year. Climate change and sea-level rise would affect tourism
  directly and indirectly. The loss of beaches to erosion and inundation, increasing
  stress on coastal ecosystems, damage to infrastructure, and an overall loss
  of amenities would jeopardize the viability of the tourist industry in many
  small islands. </p>
<p><b><i>Integration and Adaptation</i></b></p>
<p>Proper evaluation of the overall risk of island states to projected climate
  change effects requires adoption of a fully integrated approach to vulnerability
  assessments. The sensitivity of small islands to climate change cannot be attributed
  to any single factor (e.g., size or elevation); the cumulative and synergistic
  result of these and related biophysical attributes, combined with their economic
  and sociocultural character, ultimately determines the vulnerability of these
  islands. Moreover, some islands are prone to periodic non-climate-related hazards
  (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis); the degree of vulnerability
  of such islands to climate change therefore should not be evaluated in isolation
  from these threats. In addition, vulnerability assessments for small island
  states should take into consideration the value of nonmarketed goods and services
  (e.g., subsistence assets, community structure, traditional skills and knowledge),
  which also may be at risk. In some island societies, these assets are just as
  important as marketed goods and services. </p>
<p>Numerous adaptation measures for responding to climate change and sea-level
  rise theoretically are available to small island states; given their small size
  and limited human and financial resources, however, the costs of adaptation
  often are prohibitive. Shore protection, for instance, is very expensive-and
  in the past, the design of structures has not always been appropriate for the
  coastal environments of tropical small islands. The use of more flexible, easily
  replaceable, traditional shore protection measures could be explored, particularly
  in island states of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Moreover, in planning for
  adaptation, efforts should be made to maximize the use of traditional knowledge
  and skills because island peoples have had to cope with a variety of environmental
  stresses in the past. </p>
<p>On low-lying islands and atolls where sea-level rise is projected to be a threat,
  retreat away from the coast rarely is an option, given the limited physical
  size of many islands. As a result, migration and resettlement outside national
  boundaries may have to be considered in extreme cases. </p>
<p>Uncertainties in climate change projections are likely to be a disincentive
  for implementing various adaptive measures, especially because some options
  may be costly or require changes in societal norms and behavior. For example,
  efforts to enhance the health and resilience of natural ecosystems-including
  coral reefs, mangroves, and beaches-by reducing activities that increase their
  vulnerability would be a vital adaptation strategy, but there would be monetary
  and social costs associated with their implementation. However, policies that
  seek to incorporate sound principles of integrated coastal management would
  be beneficial to the small island states in the long term-even in the absence
  of projected climate change and sea-level rise. </p>
