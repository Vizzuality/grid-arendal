<h4>11.3.7.2. Dengue and Schistosomiasis </h4>
<p>Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are widespread in many countries
  of Tropical Asia. Although the transmission of DHF is said to have resulted
  from rapid urbanization, the disease vector Aedes aegypti exists in remote areas
  (WHO, 1996a). In Tropical Asia, children are particularly affected by dengue/DHF;
  these diseases cause many hospitalizations and deaths. According to WHO (1996a),
  dengue/DHF will continue to persist in Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand, where
  they are prevalent in endemic form. In recent years, sporadic cases and outbreaks
  also have been reported in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>Studies suggest that climate change would likely affect the distribution, life
  cycle, and population dynamics of dengue (WHO, 1996b). According to Koopman
  et al. (1991), an increase of 3-4°C in average temperature may double the reproduction
  rate of the dengue virus. Results from a simple mathematical model developed
  in Indonesia suggest that, under the best-estimate climate change scenario,
  incidences of dengue may increase threefold in Indonesia (ADB, 1994b). </p>
<p>Schistosomiasis is a water-based infectious disease caused by five species
  of the trematode Schistosoma. The spread of this disease is largely attributed
  to the expansion of irrigation in tropical regions. According to Martens et
  al. (1995), climate change-related temperature increases would influence snail
  reproduction and growth, schistome mortality, infectivity and development in
  the snail, and human-water contact. Climate change impacts on the spread of
  schistosomiasis also may be indirect (WHO, 1996b); for example, expansion of
  irrigation to new areas may introduce schistosomiasis where endemic foci already
  exist. </p>
<p>A recent assessment of the sensitivity of malaria, dengue, and schistosomiasis
  (the world's most prevalent vector-borne diseases) to global warming suggests
  an increase in the extent of geographical areas susceptible to transmission
  of malarial plasmodium parasites, dengue flavivirus, and schistosoma worms.
  Martens et al. (1997) show that the transmission potential of the three associated
  vector-borne diseases is highly sensitive to climate changes on the periphery
  of the currently endemic areas and at higher elevations within such areas, including
  Tropical Asia. With reference to present endemic areas, their findings show
  that the potential increase in epidemic transmission of malaria and dengue may
  be estimated at 12-27% and 31-47%, respectively; in contrast, schistosomiasis
  transmission potential may be expected to exhibit a 11-17% decrease. </p>
<h4>11.3.7.3. Other Diseases<a name="other"></a> </h4>
<p>In recent years, incidence of visceral leishmaniasis has increased in some
  countries of Tropical Asia. During 1987-1990, visceral leishmaniasis reached
  epidemic form in the Indian state of Bihar and spread rapidly to surrounding
  areas. WHO (1996a) estimated that about 110 million people were at risk from
  visceral leishmaniasis. Major endemic foci are reported in border areas between
  India (states of Bihar and West Bengal), Bangladesh, and Nepal. In Bangladesh,
  visceral leishmaniasis already has reached epidemic form; the most vulnerable
  populations are poor and rural cattlekeepers. Reported cases appear to cluster
  close to flood-control embankments; there appears to be a significant risk that
  visceral leishmaniasis prevalence in some localities will increase as a result
  of flood-control and drainage projects (ISPAN, 1992). In a warmer climate, the
  incidence of visceral leishmaniasis also may increase (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
  18.3; WHO, 1996b). </p>
<p>Other waterborne and food-borne infectious diseases pose a great threat to
  public health in the tropical monsoon region. In 1995, in eight countries of
  the region (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka,
  and Thailand), the total death toll from diarrhea was estimated to be 1.03 million;
  71% and 12% of the deaths occurred in India and Bangladesh, respectively. Children
  under age 5 accounted for about 25% of these deaths (WHO, 1996a). </p>
<p>According to Colwell (1996), the major rivers of the Indian subcontinent that
  discharge into the Bay of Bengal carry huge amounts of agricultural and industrial
  waste, providing nutrients sufficient to convert coastal waters to eutrophic
  conditions. Brackish water extends some distance upriver for all rivers. Salinities
  between 5 ppm and 30 ppm, which were detected in inland coastal areas of Bangladesh,
  as well as in seawater (Huq et al., 1984), are favorable for the growth of V.
  cholerae. </p>
<p>In the Bay of Bengal, evidence has been found-by synthesizing satellite remote-sensing,
  in-situ hydrographic and meteorological data sets, and cholera cases in Bangladesh-that
  cholera cases occur with a rise in ocean temperature (Colwell, 1996). Two peak
  periods for cholera outbreaks have been identified: from early April to mid-May
  and from early September to the end of November. During these periods, high
  sea-surface temperature, salinity, and concentrations of nutrients probably
  favor the growth of V. cholerae. Outbreaks during the monsoon have been substantially
  smaller. Colwell (1996) also indicated a possible link between outbreaks of
  cholera in Peru and neighboring countries and a warming ENSO event. Although
  the ENSO phenomenon has a substantial effect on the Indian summer monsoon, its
  linkage with cholera has not been investigated. Future increases in sea-surface
  temperature, as well as increased concentrations of pollutants in river flows
  under climate change scenarios, may create a more favorable environment for
  the growth of V. cholerae throughout the year in the coastal area of Bangladesh.
</p>
<p>Essential steps in recognizing and mitigating the emergence of malaria, dengue,
  and bilharzia, as well as many other infectious diseases, include enhanced surveillance
  and response (Martens et al., 1997). Dowlatabadi (1997) argues that because
  public health measures, case management, and land use play more significant
  roles in determining the prevalence of malaria than does climate, the most appropriate
  policy is to introduce or improve simple public health measures in the region;
  this approach would ensure that, even with climate change, developing countries
  would be far less susceptible to marginal increases in the potential prevalence
  of diseases such as malaria, schistosomiasis, dengue, and cholera. </p>
