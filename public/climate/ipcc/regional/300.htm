<h4>11.3.6. Coastal Zones </h4>
<p>The impacts of climate change on coastal areas in Tropical Asia could be severe
  and in some areas catastrophic. Nicholls et al. (1995) estimate that (assuming
  no adaptation and no change in existing population) a 1-m rise in sea level
  could displace nearly 15 million, 7 million, and at least 2 million people from
  their homes in Bangladesh, India, and Indonesia, respectively; millions more
  could be threatened in Viet Nam, Myanmar, Thailand, and the Philippines. (Potential
  impacts on special tropical coastal ecosystems, including coral reefs and mangroves,
  are discussed in Section <a href="291.htm#eco">11.3.2</a>.) </p>
<p>Sea-level rise and heavy rainfall events are projected with some confidence
  to increase with climate change; these increases, superimposed on existing coastal
  problems, would have major impacts, regardless of whether there is any change
  in the frequency or intensity of tropical storms. </p>
<p>Projected impacts include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Land loss and population displacement</li>
  <li>Increased flooding of low-lying coastal areas </li>
  <li>Agricultural impacts (e.g., loss of yield and employment) resulting from
    inundation, salinization, and land loss</li>
  <li>Impacts on coastal aquaculture</li>
  <li>Impacts on coastal tourism, particularly the erosion of sandy beaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nicholls et al. (1995) consider the first of these impacts to be the most serious
  coastal issue in the region. They estimate that a 1-m rise in sea level could
  lead to land loss in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia of nearly 30,000;
  6,000; 34,000; and 7,000 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. In Viet Nam, 5,000 km<sup>2</sup> of land could
  be inundated in the Red River delta, and 15,000-20,000 km<sup>2</sup> of land may be threatened
  in the Mekong delta. </p>
<p>Several studies have been undertaken on the vulnerability of Bangladesh to
  climate change, particularly to sea-level rise. A comprehensive summary appears
  in Warrick and Ahmad (1996). Recent geological studies suggest that the magnitude
  of tectonic subsidence in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta of Bangladesh is greater
  than has been taken into account in some earlier projections; this subsidence
  is expected to result in higher estimates of relative sea-level rise. Around
  the city of Dhaka, average subsidence is about 0.62 mm/yr; elsewhere, it can
  exceed 20 mm/yr (Alam, 1996). </p>
<p>The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the world's most densely populated areas,
  and the combined effects of subsidence and sea-level rise could cause serious
  drainage and sedimentation problems, in addition to coastal erosion and land
  loss. With higher sea level, more areas would be affected by cyclonic surges;
  inland freshwater lakes, ponds, and aquifers could be affected by saline and
  brackish-water intrusion. The present limit of tidal influence is expected to
  move further upstream, and increases in soil salinity, as well as surface-water
  and groundwater salinity, may cause serious water supply problems for drinking
  and irrigation over large areas (Alam, 1996). Reduced dry-season freshwater
  supply from upstream sources may further exacerbate salinity conditions in the
  coastal area of Bangladesh. These impacts clearly would have immense socioeconomic
  costs. </p>
<p>The other large deltaic areas in Tropical Asia-such as the Irrawaddy in Myanmar
  and the Mekong and Red in Viet Nam-as well as smaller deltaic regions and low-lying
  coastal plains in India, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines
  will be affected in similar ways. Specific examples of vulnerability assessments
  and impact analyses for several south and southeast Asian countries are given
  in McLean and Mimura (1993), Chou (1994), Nicholls and Leatherman (1995), Erda
  et al. (1996), and Milliman and Haq (1996). </p>
<p>The magnitude of physical and socioeconomic impacts of sea-level rise alone
  on a small segment of the Malaysian coast in West Johor, which is occupied by
  150,000 people, has been detailed by Teh and Voon (1992). In this example, a
  projected coastal embankment failure resulting from sea-level rise would result
  in a substantial reduction in the area under agriculture and extensive damage
  to houses, schools, and other social amenities. In addition, millions of dollars
  of revenue loss from the destruction of the three main crops (coconuts, oil
  palm, and rubber) ultimately could involve a population shift inland. This example
  is duplicated many times in the region, with the implication that greenhouse-induced
  sea-level rise may require a reassessment of existing and future coastal developments-as
  has been done in Malaysia (Midun and Lee, 1995). </p>
<p>In the previous example, the area was essentially rural and agricultural. The
  potential impact of sea-level rise on recreational and tourist sectors-for example,
  on the east coast of peninsular Malaysia (Wong, 1992) and at Phuket, Thailand
  (Wong, 1995)-and on infrastructure, harbors, and airports also would be severe.
  Indeed, Nicholls (1995) shows that present and future megacities of the region-including
  Jakarta, Bangkok, and Manila-are especially vulnerable. For Bangkok, the steady
  rise in sea level poses a threat for the investment, operation, and safety levels
  of the flood-control system, which could have an estimated annual pumping cost
  of up to US$20 million (Sabhasri and Suwarnarat, 1996). </p>
