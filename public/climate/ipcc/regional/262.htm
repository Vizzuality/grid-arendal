<ul>
  <li>Climate change is projected to have favorable impacts on agriculture in
    the northern areas of Siberia and to cause a general northward shift of crop
    zones. Grain production in southWestern Siberia is projected to fall by about
    20% as a result of a more arid climate.</li>
  <li>Projections for 2010 indicate that the need for industrial roundwood could
    increase by 38% (southern Temperate Asia) to 96% (eastern Temperate Asia).
    These requirements may result in serious shortages of boreal industrial roundwood,
    placing further stress on boreal forests. </li>
  <li>Along most of the continental coast, relative sea level (i.e., sea level
    in relation to land) is an important factor for coastal environments. Deltaic
    coasts in China face severe problems from relative sea-level rise as a result
    of tectonically and anthropogenically induced land subsidence. In the next
    50 years, the expected worldwide sea-level rise due to climate change will
    not be a major factor in relative sea-level rise for the Old Huanghe and Changjiang
    deltas in China, although it may be for the Zhujiang delta. Sea-level rise
    due to global warming will, however, exacerbate problems in all three deltas,
    along with saltwater intrusion problems in deltaic regions and coastal plains.
    China, however, has a long history in defenses against sea encroachment. </li>
  <li>Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya are all located in the coastal zone; together,
    they account for more than 50% of Japan's industrial production. In these
    metropolitan areas, already about 860 km<sup>2</sup> of coastal land-an area supporting
    2 million people and with physical assets worth $450 billion-are below mean
    high-water level. With a 1-m rise in mean sea level, the area below mean high-water
    level would expand by a factor of 2.7, embracing 4.1 million people and assets
    worth more than $900 billion. The same sea-level rise would expand the flood-prone
    area from 6,270 km<sup>2</sup> to 8,900 km<sup>2</sup>. The cost of adjusting existing protection
    measures has been estimated at about $80 billion. </li>
  <li>One of the potential threats that sea-level rise poses is exacerbated beach
    erosion. Sandy beaches occupy 20-25% of the total length of the Japanese coast.
    About 120 km<sup>2</sup> of these beaches have been eroded over the past 70 years. An
    additional 118 km<sup>2</sup> of beaches-57% of the remaining sandy beaches in Japan
    today-would disappear with a 30-cm sea-level rise. This percentage would increase
    to 82% and 90% if the sea level rose by 65 cm or 100 cm, respectively.</li>
  <li>An increase in the frequency or severity of heat waves would cause an increase
    in (predominantly cardiorespiratory) mortality and illness. Studies of urban
    populations in Temperate Asia indicate that the number of heat-related deaths
    would increase several-fold in response to modeled climate change scenarios
    for 2050.</li>
  <li>North China-including Beijing, Tianjin, the four provinces (Hebei, Henan,
    Shandong, Shanxi), part of Anhui province, and part of inner Mongolia-is an
    economic center of the country. It also is a topographic and climatological
    entity. Because this region already is at risk from normal climate variability,
    it also is likely to be quite vulnerable to long-term secular shifts.
    <ol>
      <li><i>Water resources</i>: Water resources in north China are vulnerable
	to climate change because of already low levels of available per capita
	water supplies, water projects that already are highly developed, large
	changes in river runoff related mainly to variability in flood season,
	and rapid economic development. Water resources also are sensitive to
	climate change because of the critical dependence of floods on the Asian
	monsoon and the ENSO phenomenon.</li>
      <li><i>Agriculture</i>: This region appears to be especially sensitive to
	climate change because of potential increases in the soil moisture deficit.
	Warming and increased evapotranspiration, along with possible declines
	in precipitation, would make it difficult to maintain the current crop
	pattern in areas along the Great Wall and would limit the present practice
	of cultivating two crops in succession in the Huang-Hai Plains. Although
	climate warming may cause northward shifts of subtropical crop areas,
	frequent waterlogging in the south and spring droughts in the north would
	inhibit the growth of subtropical crops. </li>
      <li><i>Forests</i>: Demands for agriculture as a result of population increases
	and changes in the characteristics of arable lands due to climate change
	will likely result in large reductions of forest area. </li>
      <li><i>Coastal zones</i>: Climate change will exacerbate the already serious
	problem of relative sea-level rise because of tectonic subsidence and
	heavy groundwater withdrawal. Defense against sea encroachment would be
	the only viable response because of the high concentration of population
	and economic activities. Contamination of groundwater by seawater intrusion
	would further worsen the water resource shortage problem.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><i>Research needs</i>: (i) Projection of regional climatic scenarios with
    high spatial and temporal resolution; (ii) improved hydrological models with
    appropriate land-surface parameters under nonstationary climatic conditions;
    (iii) multiple-stress impact studies on water resources in international river
    basins; (iv) implementation strategies for integrated coastal zone management,
    taking climate change into consideration; (v) studies of the interactive effects
    of stresses on human health from hot weather and high levels of air pollution;
    and (vi) integrated impact studies that consider different sectors and their
    response to adaptation strategies.</li>
  <li><i>Conclusion</i>: The major impacts of global warming on Temperate Asia
    will likely take the form of large shifts of the boreal forests, the disappearance
    of significant portions of mountain glaciers, and shortages in the water supply.
    The most critical uncertainty in these estimates stems from the lack of credible
    projections of the hydrological cycle under global warming scenarios. The
    effects of climate change on the Asian monsoon and the ENSO phenomenon are
    among the major uncertainties in the modeling of the hydrological cycle. Projections
    of agricultural crop yields are uncertain not only because of the uncertainty
    in the hydrological cycle but also because of the potential positive effects
    of CO<sub>2</sub> and production practices. In the coastal zones, sea-level rise endangers
    sandy beaches but remains an anthropogenically induced problem in deltaic
    areas. Integrated impact studies that consider multiple stress factors are
    needed. </li>
