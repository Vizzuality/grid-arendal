<h4>6.3.1.2. Rangelands </h4>
<p>Rangelands-grasslands, shrublands, savannahs, and hot and cold deserts, excluding
  hyper-arid deserts-cover 33% of the area of Latin America (IPCC 1996, WG II,
  Section 2.1). Rangeland productivity and species composition are directly related
  to the highly variable amounts and seasonal distribution of precipitation and
  only secondarily controlled by other climate variables. Because rangeland systems
  are driven by extremes, increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme
  events (Easterling, 1990) may have a disproportionate effect on them (Westoby
  et al., 1989). Because of their low productivity, rangeland management units
  usually are very large, often incorporating considerable spatial heterogeneity
  (Stafford Smith and Pickup, 1993). </p>
<p>Latin American rangelands sustain pastoralist activities, subsistence farming,
  and commercial ranching and are a key factor in the economy of many countries
  (e.g., Mexico, countries of the Central American isthmus, Brazil, Argentina,
  Uruguay). There are approximately 570 million animal units on the subcontinent,
  and over 80% of them feed from rangelands (<a href="325.htm">Annex D</a>).
</p>
<p>Human activities may bring about more change in rangeland ecosystems than any
  other forces of global change and may interact strongly with climate change
  impacts, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
  2.3.3). In Argentine Patagonia, for example, the introduction of unsustainable
  numbers of sheep along with inappropriate management policies has resulted in
  major changes in pastureland composition and even desertification (Soriano and
  Movia, 1986). This process is causing the loss of approximately 1,000 km<sup>2</sup> per
  year (LAC CDE, 1992); overall, 35% of the area's pastureland has been transformed
  into desert (Winograd, 1995). As a result, the number of sheep decreased by
  30% between 1960 and 1988-representing a loss of about US$260 million (Paruelo
  and Sala, 1992). </p>
<p>Boundaries between rangelands and other biomes are likely to be affected by
  climate changes both directly (e.g., changes in species composition) and indirectly,
  through changes in fire regimes, opportunistic cultivation, or agricultural
  release of less-arid margins of the rangeland territory. </p>
<p>Concerning possible climate impacts of tropical deforestation, Salati and Nobre
  (1991) pointed out that the large-scale conversion of tropical forests into
  pastures will likely lead to changes in local climates of the Amazon region.
  This kind of land-use change increases surface and soil temperatures, the diurnal
  fluctuation of temperature, and the specific humidity deficit and reduces evapotranspiration-there
  is less available radiative energy at the canopy level because grass has a higher
  albedo than forests (Cerri et al., 1995). </p>
<p>Climate characteristics affecting soil moisture conditions, relative humidity,
  or drought stress-in conjunction with changes in fire and grazing regimes-will
  have the greatest influence on the boundaries of grassland and woody species.
  In Mexico, approximately 70% of xerophytic shrublands have been projected to
  shift their geographical distribution as a result of climate change (Villers,
  1995). This projection is roughly in agreement with outputs from MAPSS and BIOME
  3 (Neilson, 1995; Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996; see <a href="315.htm">Annex C</a>), although these models suggest less dramatic suface reduction. The overall
  carrying capacity for herbivores may increase or decrease, depending on the
  balance between eventual increases in productivity and decreases in plant nutritional
  value. In some regions, warmer temperatures and increased summer rainfall, with
  fewer frost days, may facilitate the replacement of temperate grasses by tropical
  grasses (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 2.6). Although some laboratory experiments
  on plants grown individually have shown that C<sub>3</sub> (temperate) plants tend to respond
  more positively than C<sub>4</sub> (tropical) plants to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, differential effects
  can be offset or even reversed in the field because traits other than photosynthetic
  pathways-such as architecture phenology, water, and nutrient-use efficiency-tend
  to play more decisive roles in the field (Bazzaz and McConnaughay, 1992). </p>
<p>The net effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on forage quality also is uncertain. Elevated
  CO<sub>2</sub> usually results in higher C:N ratios in plants. This effect is reflected
  in increased herbivore consumption and decreased herbivore fitness in laboratory
  experiments involving insect populations and individual plants (Lindroth, 1996).
  It is uncertain whether similar patterns would occur in systems involving rangelands
  and large vertebrate herbivores (Díaz, 1995). Any alteration of the standing
  capacity of grasslands will be economically important, given the scale of livestock
  production in Latin American tropical and temperate grasslands. </p>
<p>Fire has been a factor in the evolution of grasslands and many other types
  of rangelands (Medina and Silva, 1990; Eskuche, 1992). Projected substantial
  increases in the frequency and severity of wildfires (Ottichilo et al., 1991;
  Torn and Fried, 1992) could lead to vegetation and soil alterations (Ojima et
  al., 1990). </p>
<p>Temperate grasslands and the animal production depending on them are vulnerable
  to drought. Therefore, livestock production could be negatively affected by
  higher temperatures or increased evapotranspiration rates. However, experience
  has shown that extreme events, such as large-scale floods or drought-erosion
  cycles, may pose the highest risks (Burgos et al., 1991; Suriano et al., 1992).
</p>
<p>Because of their large extent and important capacity to sequester carbon, temperate
  grasslands play an important role in the maintenance of the composition of the
  atmosphere. Sala and Paruelo (1997) have estimated the value of maintaining
  native grasslands to be US$200/ha; they stress that, once grasslands have been
  transformed into croplands, the reverse process of abandonment of croplands
  and their slow transformation into native grasslands sequesters only a modest
  amount of carbon over relatively long periods of time. Fisher et al. (1994)
  have proposed increasing the carbon sequestration capacity of grasslands through
  reduced burning frequency, nutritional supplementation of soils, and introduction
  of deep-rooted grasses and legumes, in combination with controlled stocking
  rates. </p>
