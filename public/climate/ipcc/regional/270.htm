<h4>10.2.1.5. Cryosphere </h4>
<p>If projections of climate change for the year 2050 (UKMO-X5) are realized,
  a number of impacts on the cryosphere are likely. Projected warming of the climate
  would reduce the area and volume of the cryosphere. This reduction would have
  significant impacts on related ecosystems, people, and their livelihoods. There
  could be pronounced reductions in seasonal snow, permafrost, glaciers, and periglacial
  belts, with a corresponding shift in landscape processes. Pronounced alterations
  in glacier-melt runoff also are likely as the climate changes (IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Section 7.4). </p>
<p>Snow cover in the temperate regions ranges from a few meters to a few centimeters,
  but the snow often is close to its melting point; consequently, continental
  and alpine snow covers are very sensitive to climate. As warming occurs for
  many Asian mountains, there is a tendency for rainfall to occur at the expense
  of snowfall, although the extent of this shift depends on location. Less snow
  will accumulate at low elevations, although there may be more snow above the
  freezing level as a result of increased precipitation (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections
  7.3.1 and 7.4.1). </p>
<p>Glaciers are more sensitive to changes in temperature than to any other climatic
  element. For Asian glaciers, where precipitation occurs mainly during the summer
  monsoon season, temperature rise has a double effect. The first effect is an
  increase in the absorption of solar radiation caused by a lowering of the surface
  albedo, as snowfall is converted to rainfall. The second effect is an increase
  in energy exchange between the atmosphere and the glacier surface (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Section 7.3.1). Both effects lead to an increase in glacial melting.
</p>
<p>Empirical and energy-balance models indicate that a large fraction (about one-third
  to one-half) of the world's existing mountain glacier mass could disappear with
  anticipated warming over the next 100 years. By 2050, up to a quarter of mountain
  glacier mass may have melted. However, the largest alpine glaciers-such as those
  found in the Pamirs, the Tien Shan, and the Himalayas-are expected to continue
  to exist into the 22nd century. Other studies are based on calculations of ablation
  and equilibrium-line altitude, according to given climatic scenarios. Ablation
  would intensify in central Asia with climate warming because conditions there
  could become even more continental (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.4.2). </p>
<p>The broad sensitivity of permafrost to past climate change is well documented
  in Siberia and China. There would be a poleward shift of permafrost zones, although
  deep-seated, ice-rich permafrost will be resistant to changes. Permafrost in
  northeast China is expected to disappear if temperature increases by 2�C or
  more. Over the Qing-Zang plateau, estimates of climate change impacts on permafrost
  range from complete disappearance for a temperature increase of 2�C to the raising
  of its elevation limit to 4,600 m for a warming of 3�C (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections
  7.3.3 and 7.4.3). </p>
