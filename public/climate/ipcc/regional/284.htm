<h4>11.1.2. Physiography and Biogeography </h4>
<p>Tropical Asia includes the major land masses of south and southeast Asia, as
  well as the long peninsulas that reach into the eastern Indian and western Pacific
  Oceans and the archipelagoes comprising the thousands of islands of Indonesia,
  Malaysia, India, and the Philippines (<a href="#figure11-1">Figure 11-1</a>).
  Physiographically, Tropical Asia is extremely complex and diverse. It contains
  the highest mountains on Earth, the deepest seas, and the largest number of
  islands-the latter making up what has been called the "maritime continent."
  The high mountains and the complex land-sea configuration have a strong influence
  on the weather and climate of the region. <br>

  Geologically, Tropical Asia straddles the boundary between the Indo-Australian
  and Pacific tectonic plates. The collision and subduction zones between these
  plates are characterized primarily by earthquakes, land movements, active volcanism,
  and volcanic eruptions, which are major environmental hazards. Earthquakes and
  land movements also are responsible for local differences in relative sea level.
  The massive eruptions of Krakatoa in Indonesia more than a century ago and of
  Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 caused climatic cooling extending
  far beyond the region (Parker et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Tropical Asia includes some large drainage basins, the sources of which extend
  into arid Asia to the north and west of the region. These basins include the
  Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna, Irrawaddy, and Salween Rivers, which drain into
  the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea; and the Nan, Mekong, and Red Rivers, which
  drain into the South China Sea. Varying impacts of climate change can be expected
  on the headwaters, broad valleys, and deltaic mouths of these catchments. </p>
<p>Biogeographically, the region includes the tropical Indo-Pacific borderlands,
  which have some of the greatest natural species diversity and productivity on
  Earth; coral reefs in the marine environment and tropical rainforests on land
  are prime examples. Ecological richness also is demonstrated by the region's
  crop and livestock diversity and by its large numbers of cultivars and varieties.
  The diversity of managed plants and animals is a result, in part, of climate
  and soil; it also reflects the length of human settlement in Tropical Asia,
  as well as its cultural and ethnic diversity. In addition, a number of animals,
  insects, and microbes have developed in parallel with the vegetation in this
  region. </p>
<p>Agriculture in Tropical Asia evolved on the basis of unique crop-related diversity,
  and only a few crops from other regions have become acceptable. Throughout the
  region, agriculture is critically important; it accounts for more than 30% of
  the gross domestic product (GDP) in at least seven countries. Climate-sensitive
  crops-such as rice, other grains and cereals, vegetables, and spices-are particularly
  important in the region. There is little doubt that agricultural systems in
  Tropical Asia have adapted to a range of environmental stresses over the region's
  long history of human settlement and land-use change. Whether such resilience
  can continue in the face of climate change and economic and population changes
  is uncertain, although it is expected that the processes of ongoing adaptation
  to changing environmental circumstances will continue. </p>
