<h1>2.1. Introduction</h1>
<p>This chapter focuses on the potential impacts of climate change on ecosystems,
  natural resources, and various socioeconomic sectors of mainland Africa. To
  the extent permitted by the literature, it describes the functions and current
  status of a number of key resource sectors and ecosystems; the ways in which
  these systems would respond to changes in climatic conditions; options for adaptation
  to projected changes in climate; and the vulnerability of each system or sector,
  taking into account adaptation options as well as impediments to their implementation.
  Downing (1992, 1996) suggests that vulnerability is an aggregate measure of
  human welfare that integrates environmental, social, economic, and political
  exposure to a range of potentially harmful perturbations or threats. Vulnerability
  varies spatially and temporally for different communities, although they may
  face the same risk (Eele, 1996). Feasible strategies for coping with future
  climate changes therefore must be rooted in a full understanding of the complex
  structure and causes of present-day social vulnerability, through an understanding
  of vulnerability to climatic variability on seasonal to interannual time scales.
</p>
<p>Although Africa, of all the major world regions, has contributed the least
  to potential climate change because of its low per capita fossil energy use
  and hence low greenhouse gas emissions, it is the most vulnerable continent
  to climate change because widespread poverty limits capabilities to adapt. The
  ultimate socioeconomic impacts of climate change will depend on the relative
  resilience and adaptation abilities of different social groups. In general,
  the commercial sector and high-income households in communal areas are better
  equipped to adjust adequately and in a timely fashion. Much will depend on the
  coping abilities and mechanisms used by governments and households over the
  next 50 years or so. Such abilities are determined by political stewardships.
  If the region manages to achieve reasonable economic growth, the prospects for
  proper adjustments to climate change are much better than if economic stagnation
  prevails (Hulme, 1996b). <br>

<h4>2.1.1. Physical Geography<a name="physical"></a></h4>
<p>Africa has a total land area of 30,244,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Countries considered in this
  chapter are listed in <a href="008.htm#box2-1">Box 2-1</a>, and socioeconomic
  data are provided in <a href="325.htm">Annex D</a>. </p>
<p>Africa's physical features include a series of plateaus, higher in the east
  and gradually declining toward the west. The general elevation is relieved by
  great shallow basins and their river systems; by the deep incision of the 6,400-km
  Great Rift Valley; and by often-magnificent volcanoes, fault blocks, and inselbergs.
  <a href="008.htm#figure2-1">Figure 2-1</a> shows capitals, other major cities,
  and elevations. The highest point is Mount Kilimanjaro (5,894 m); the lowest
  point is in the Qattara Depression, at 132 m below sea level. Africa's vast
  plateaus are broken only by a few rather low mountain ranges-of which the outstanding
  ones are the Atlas, Ahaggar, Cameroons, Tibetsi, and Ethiopian and east African
  highlands, as well as the Drakensberg Mountains. In east Africa are (in addition
  to Kilimanjaro) Mount Kenya (5,199 m), the Ruwenzoris (5,120 m), and Mount Elgon
  (4,321 m) (Pritchard, 1985). </p>
<p>The African continent encompasses a rich mosaic of ecological settings. Together
  these ecosystems harbor a wealth of economically and biologically important
  resources, from individual species to productive habitats (Huq et al., 1996).
  One quarter of Africa is hyper-arid desert; one third is in the humid climate
  zone; and the remainder of the continent is dryland, consisting of arid, semi-arid,
  and dry subhumid areas (UNEP, 1992). These drylands are home to about 400 million
  people-two-thirds of the continent's total population. Recurrent droughts have
  long been a permanent feature of life throughout the drylands of Africa. Over
  the past 30 years or so, however, unusually severe and/or prolonged droughts
  in these drylands have seriously affected agriculture and wildlife and caused
  many deaths and severe malnutrition. In some areas, desertification has accompanied
  these droughts, although the processes leading to desertification are much more
  varied than climate alone. Currently, 36 countries in Africa are affected by
  recurrent drought and some degree of desertification (UNEP, 1992). The risk
  of drought is highest in the Sudano-Sahelian belt and in southern Africa (Nicholson
  et al., 1988). </p>
