<h4>10.3.2. Forests in Temperate Asia </h4>
<p>Forests, which are characterized by their composition of tree species, are
  among the important ecosystems of the environment. They are greatly affected
  by climate, soil, fire, industry, tourism, and pipeline/railway/road construction.
  Consequently, the expected impact of global warming on forests would vary from
  region to region. </p>
<p>In Temperate Asia, temperature seems to be the primary environmental parameter
  affecting the distribution of forests because sufficient precipitation exists
  for almost all forest types. Exceptions are in regions with heavy snow accumulation,
  windy mountain crests and slopes, or windy coastal zones. </p>
<p>In particular, the amount of snow accumulation seems to be an important parameter
  for forest growth. Accumulated snow protects trees from severe cold, but its
  weight can damage the branches and trunks. In Japan, large differences in snow
  accumulation between the Japan Sea side and the Pacific side are strongly reflected
  in the corresponding forest types. </p>
<p>The amount of snowfall may decrease as a result of global warming, resulting
  in spring and summer drought. Uncertainty remains, however, because changes
  in snowfall amounts depend on changes in the frequency of snow and freezing
  precipitation in the winter in the mountain regions; the wind speed and the
  difference between the air temperature and the sea-surface temperature over
  the Japan Sea in winter, which determine the amount of snow precipitation over
  mountain regions on the Japan Sea side; the ratio of snowfall to rainfall in
  winter; the dates of onset and termination of snowfall and the maximum depth
  of snow accumulation during winter; and the density of accumulated snow. </p>
<p>Almost all forest trees would grow better under a warmer climate, but increases
  in diseases, insect damages, and other meteorological hazards (e.g., severe
  storm damage) also may result in a shortened life for forest trees (Tsunekawa
  et al., 1996a). When the original species in a forest decline, other species
  from neighboring forest zones more suitable for warmer conditions would grow.
  If there were an afforested region or broad cultivated area between natural
  forests, such changes would not occur. The impact of warming would occur noticeably
  on a time scale of decades to centuries, in areas where the distribution of
  plant communities is continuous. </p>
<p>Forests of the Hokuriku region on the Japan Sea side of central Japan are likely
  to respond to climatic change (Kojima, 1996). Of the four vegetation belts,
  the Pinus pumila zone-the highest belt in elevation-would be most seriously
  affected. It may remain only in small areas at higher elevations or even become
  fragmented by the upward advance of plant species adapted to a warmer climate.
  Uncertainties from the viewpoint of vegetation are the rate of geographical
  expansion of plant species, the time lag between climate change and soil change,
  and phenological (seasonal) and environmental adaptation of plant species. </p>
<p>Catastrophic scenarios include water deficit as a result of decreasing precipitation
  and/or increasing evapotranspiration due to warming; elevated minimum temperatures,
  resulting in the absence of low-temperature stimulation needed for germination,
  flowering, and fruition; and discord in the seasonal rhythm of air temperature
  and daytime length, which controls the phenology of plant growth for plants
  propagated to the north. </p>
<p>According to a study on potential vegetation distribution shifts in China (Tsunekawa
  et al., 1996b), the northward shift rate of the deciduous genus Queras is projected
  to be 7 km/year-14-24 times faster than the migration rate recorded over the
  past 13,000 years in Europe. Difficulty in adaptation would be expected for
  such a rapid shift. </p>
<p>Forest and grassland fire is expected to occur more frequently and in broader
  areas in northern parts of Temperate Asia as a result of global warming and
  deforestation activities. In May 1987, one of the largest forest fires of the
  past 30 years occurred in China and Russia. In the Daxinganlin mountain range
  of northeast China, it was reported that the total area burned was 1,010 x 103
  ha, at 729 sites. The most serious wildfire in the forests and grasslands in
  Mongolia occurred in March 1996. The burned-out area was estimated to be about
  8,000 x 103 ha. Although the occurrence of forest fires varies greatly each
  year, such serious cases should be taken into consideration in global warming
  impact studies. </p>
