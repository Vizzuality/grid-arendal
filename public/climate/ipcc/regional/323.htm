<h1>C.7. Conclusions </h1>
<p>MAPSS and BIOME3 produce qualitatively similar results under alternative future
  climate scenarios, with or without including a direct, physiological CO<sub>2</sub> effect.
  However, MAPSS produces consistently stronger drought effects with increasing
  temperature than does BIOME3. When under common scenarios, the two models produce
  similar subregional sensitivities. That is, if two adjacent subregions show
  opposite sign responses under a future climate in MAPSS, they will tend to exhibit
  the same relationship in BIOME3, but the overall sensitivity will be lower in
  BIOME3. The newer scenarios, constructed from transient GCM experiments, are
  consistently less xeric, as measured by simulated changes in leaf area index
  (LAI), than the older, equilibrium GCM scenarios. Under the newer scenarios,
  both ecological models indicate an overall increase in LAI (although nutrient
  constraints could limit or delay the increase), when a direct physiological
  CO<sub>2</sub> effect is included. However, if the direct CO<sub>2</sub> effects are not included,
  both models indicate a general reduction in global vegetation density. </p>
<p>The changes in vegetation leaf area (LAI) simulated by both MAPSS and BIOME3
  are analogous to the changes in soil water content reported by earlier GCM experiments
  (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 6). Those earlier experiments maintained a fixed vegetated
  land surface. That is, the vegetation type and density were not allowed to respond
  to changes in either climate or elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Therefore, as evaporative
  demand went up in those simulations, soil water content decreased, or was totally
  depleted. MAPSS and BIOME3, however, absorb those processes directly in the
  vegetation response. Both models simulate water-limited LAI by maximizing the
  LAI that can be supported and just barely transpire available soil water. Thus,
  in the equilibrium solution to LAI, soil water is fully utilized and can't change
  much under altered climates. Changes in the site water balance are, therefore,
  indicated by changes in LAI. </p>
<p>The newer climate scenarios used in this analysis are relatively cool in comparison
  to other possible new scenarios (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 6). Therefore, the
  analyses presented here must be considered as a relatively conservative subset
  of the possible future ecological responses. </p>
<p>Although many of the simulations from both MAPSS and BIOME3 indicate potentially
  large expansions of tropical and in some cases temperate forests, actual expansions
  would be limited by urban and agricultural land-use constraints, unsuitable
  soils in some areas and slow dispersal rates, among other factors. Even so,
  if a forest is anticipated to expand into a region formerly indicated as shrubland,
  any agriculture in the region might expect an increase in potential productivity,
  and vice versa. Such changes between forest and shrubland are usually underlain
  by a change in LAI, which reflects the site water balance. An increase or decrease
  in LAI indicates a change in the water or energy balance and the potential biomass
  density or carrying capacity that could be supported on the site, regardless
  of whether the biomass is 'natural' or agricultural (dryland agriculture only).
</p>
<p>The results presented here are for steady-state, or equilibrium conditions
  and do not directly indicate how the systems would behave in their transient
  responses toward a new equilibrium. For example, in areas where LAI is indicated
  to decline, it may be that equilibrium runoff is indicated to increase. However,
  one hypothesis is that during the processes of LAI decline, increased evaporative
  demand could cause reductions in runoff, before the vegetation becomes sufficiently
  drought-stressed for the LAI to be reduced. After further time, if the vegetation
  is sufficiently drought stressed, a rapid dieback could occur and might be facilitated
  by pests and fire. Were vegetation to undergo such a large dieback, then transpiration
  demand would be temporarily reduced and runoff could increase substantially.
  Thus, before a new equilibrium is attained with new vegetation growth, streams
  could go through a dry to wet oscillation. These possible hydrologic responses
  to vegetation change are, however, of a different timeframe (years) than possible
  short term floods and droughts that could occur simply due to increased variation
  of extreme weather events (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 6). </p>
<p>At least two contrasting, transient trajectories of vegetation change are possible.
  If a large, direct CO<sub>2</sub> benefit were to occur, vegetation could increase in growth
  and biomass under relatively cool, early warming conditions, only to experience
  drought-stress and decline or dieback under the hotter, later stages of warming.
  Alternatively, if direct CO<sub>2</sub> benefits are more muted, vegetation could become
  drought-stressed and experience decline or dieback within the next few decades
  even under mild warming. Expansion of forests into cooler zones would likely
  lag behind decline and dieback in warmer zones, producing a transient reduction
  in forest area, possible increases in pests and fire, and possibly large releases
  of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere (King and Neilson, 1992; Smith and Shugart, 1993).
