<h4>5.3.2.1. Agricultural Production </h4>
<p>Although agriculture on a global basis could remain unchanged relative to base
  production in a changed climate-as a result of technological improvements and
  more efficient agricultural practices (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 13)-there will
  be large regional discrepancies; these differences may be less acute in Europe,
  where agriculture is highly advanced. </p>
<p>Agricultural production can be described in terms of amount and quality. The
  reactions of an individual crop to global change will depend on the balance
  of shorter cycles resulting from increased air temperatures, shorter periods
  to accumulate yield products (at least in the case of determinate crops), higher
  potential yields resulting from increased assimilation of CO<sub>2</sub>, and increased
  water-use efficiency resulting from enhanced regulation of transpiration with
  elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. This equilibrium could be quite subtle in the highly mechanized
  context of European agriculture. </p>
<p>Projections of future European production derive from controlled-conditions
  experiments and from feeding crop simulation models, with climatic observations
  adjusted according to scenarios of future climate. Quantitative results of simulations
  therefore are highly dependent on the type of climate scenario used (especially
  in terms of available precipitation), though qualitative indications (trends)
  generally are constant among published results. </p>
<p>Most simulation and experimental studies so far have used expected fluctuations
  of mean values for climate variables, but increasing emphasis is being put on
  possible consequences of a more variable interannual and intra-annual climate
  (i.e., within and between years). </p>
<h4>5.3.2.1.1. Annual crops<a name="annual"></a> </h4>
<p>In the following paragraphs, crops are classified according to their main growing
  period: winter (i.e., late autumn, winter, spring, and sometimes early summer)
  or summer (i.e., spring, summer, and early autumn). For Europe, winter crops
  include winter cereals, peas, and rapeseed; summer crops include maize (forage
  and grain), sunflowers, potatoes, sugar beet, and spring cereals. The results
  below need to be tempered by the physiological characteristics of crops-for
  instance, the shortening of the crop season resulting from increasing temperature
  is far less marked on nondeterminate crops (peas, potatoes) than on determinate
  crops (wheat). </p>
<p><i>Suitable areas</i> </p>
<p>As a result of increasing air temperatures in winter, the risks associated
  with damaging frosts will be reduced as a whole. This factor will allow expansion
  of winter cereals and probably other winter crops (CLAIRE, 1996) in large areas
  such as southern Fennoscandia, western Russia, and the Alpine regions-topography,
  physiography, soils, and socioeconomic circumstances permitting. Increasing
  spring temperatures will accelerate soil temperature increases and extend suitable
  zones for most summer crops, allowing a reasonable length for their growth season.
  In the case of sunflowers (and probably for grain maize), the area of suitability
  would extend eastward to Belarus and northward to northern Germany and southern
  Fennoscandia for a specified climate change. As an illustrative example, the
  northern limit of reliable spring cereal cultivation in Finland has been estimated
  to shift northward by 100-150 km for each 1°C of warming (Carter et al., 1996).
  For a representative range of temperature scenarios, the rate of northward shift
  is about 10-80 km per decade (Saarikko and Carter, 1996). Some northward shift
  also is simulated for vegetable crops like onion (CLAIRE, 1996). As far as temperature
  is concerned, there is no region that would become completely unsuitable for
  agriculture-even in southern Europe under high-temperature climate change scenarios.
  Studies currently are being carried out to determine what damage can occur in
  crops at extremely high temperatures. </p>
<p><i>Crop duration</i> </p>
<p>Expected increases in temperature will cause faster rates of development as
  a whole (see "Adaptive Responses" below) and shorten the length of growing periods
  for determinate crops, consequently shortening the length of the grain-filling
  period. The total growing season for these crops may be reduced by 15-30 days,
  depending on the climate scenarios used; in this respect, crop duration could
  be more reduced in central and eastern Europe (4 weeks) than in western Europe
  (3 weeks). Cereal harvest dates therefore would occur sooner. Nevertheless,
  some indication is given by Miglietta et al. (1995) that a lack of cold days
  could reduce vernalization effects and consequently lengthen the first part
  of the growing season for winter cereals. Because of faster rates of development,
  nondeterminate crops would develop more potential harvestable organs (theoretically
  during a longer period) because no development event would stop the process
  of production; increasing temperatures, however, probably would favor an increased
  senescence rate of the crop and tend to mitigate the beneficial effect of increases
  in potential organs by reducing the length of crop photosynthetic life. </p>
<p>Temperature increases in spring and summer will accelerate the course of crop
  development more crucially on short-cycle crops that are sown in spring than
  on winter crops. This general rule must be adapted, however, to local conditions
  (see, e.g., Saarikko and Carter, 1996)-who show by simulation that the sowing-to-leading
  phase in spring cereals in Finland declines by about 1 day per 1°C warming,
  and the heading-to-yellow ripening shortens by 2-4 days per 1°C warming). A
  simulation exercise on sunflowers shows a reduction of the crop cycle by 10-50
  days with UKTR3140 scenario and 10-70 days with UKTR6675 (see Harrison and Butterfield,
  1996 for extensive results on sunflower development under different GCM-based
  scenarios). This quite important change is likely to affect most of Europe,
  with a gradient from the southWest (low reduction in Spain and Italy, where
  cycles are already short) to the northeast (Poland and Russia). This pattern
  can be extrapolated to all determinate summer crops. Nondeterminate crops would
  experience a faster rate of development as well, which would induce earlier
  senescence. </p>
<p><i>Crop yields</i></p>
<p>Accounting for the enhancement of growth resulting from increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations,
  the potential yield of winter crops (assuming that neither precipitation nor
  irrigation is limiting) would increase almost everywhere (with central or southern
  Europe experiencing the highest winter wheat yield boosts, depending on the
  climatic scenario). If water limitations are considered, crop response apparently
  would depend on the scenario chosen for the time evolution of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.
  In the case of winter wheat, there is some indication that the rate of increase
  in yields across Europe could be 0.2-0.36 T/ha/decade under the IS92a emission
  scenario and 0.13 T/ha/decade with the IS92d emission scenario, under both the
  UKTR3140 and the UKTR6675 climate scenarios. The largest increases would occur
  in central and eastern Europe (regardless of changes in management practices
  that may occur in some countries as a result of changes in economic structure)
  and in southern Europe (see <a href="#table5-2">Table 5-2</a>). All winter crops
  probably would follow the pattern of winter wheat yield changes. The largest
  increases per country might occur in northern Europe because of increased possibilities
  for taking winter cereals into cultivation. <br>

  For summer crops, determinate crop yields would be affected by the shortened
  crop cycle and reduced time to assimilate supply and grain-filling periods.
  On the other hand, improvements in the rate of dry-matter production can be
  expected from enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. This effect has been illustrated
  for sunflowers (CLAIRE, 1996), where simulation models suggest a compensation
  between the negative effects of temperature and the positive effects of carbon
  fertilization. Under the IS92a emission scenario, yield benefits occur in central
  and eastern Europe and losses occur in western Europe-but all of them are small.
  With IS92d emissions, the gains are even smaller, but the losses are amplified
  (see <a href="106.htm#table5-3">Table 5-3</a>). The same pattern can be expected
  for all determinate summer crops (even if the fertilizing effect of atmospheric
  CO<sub>2</sub> is less beneficial to C<sub>4</sub> crops such as maize). Similar results were obtained
  with onion, whose simulated yield increased 4-8% with UKTR3140 and GFDL2534
  (IS92a emissions) and 15% (resp. 7%) with UKTR6675 and GFDL5564, IS92a (resp.
  IS92c)-CO<sub>2</sub> effects again counteracting a negative effect of reduced growth period
  on yield (see claire, 1996). For nondeterminate crops, Peiris et al. (1996)
  expect potato yields to increase by as much as 35% under northern conditions
  as a result of the lengthening of the growing season, regardless of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization
  effects. </p>
