<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Long-term research and monitoring of key physical, chemical, and ecological
  properties (particularly water temperature and mixing properties; concentrations
  of nutrients, carbon, and major ions; acid/base status; populations of key organisms;
  primary production; and organic-matter decomposition) remain key research needs
  to reduce uncertainties in projections of freshwater fisheries' responses to
  climate change. </p>
<p><i>Climate warming may result in general shifts in freshwater species' distributions
  northward, with widespread/subregional species extinction at the lower latitudes
  and expansion at the higher latitudes of species' ranges.</i> </p>
<p>Climatic warming may produce a general shift in species distribution northward.
  Species extinction and extirpations are likely to occur at the lower latitude
  boundaries of species distributions, and range expansion likely will occur at
  the higher latitude boundaries of species distributions (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
  10.6.3). For example, a 3.8°C increase in mean annual air temperature is projected
  to eliminate more than 50% of the habitat for brook trout and result in severe
  fragmentation of its distribution in the southern Appalachian Mountains in the
  southeastern United States (Meisner, 1990). In contrast, a 4°C increase in mean
  air temperature is projected to expand the ranges of smallmouth bass and yellow
  perch northward across Canada by about 500 km (Shuter and Post, 1990). </p>
<p>In streams and rivers, particularly at low and mid-latitudes, the distributions
  of many fish species may contract because of limitations on availability of
  thermal refuges and migratory routes during periods of high temperatures and
  lower streamflow in the summer (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.6.3.2). Eaton and
  Scheller (1996) project that the suitable habitat for cold-, cool-, and even
  many warm-water fish species would be reduced by about 50% in streams of the
  lower 48 states in the United States by summer mean air temperature increases
  of 2-6°C (derived from a CCC GCM under a 2xCO<sub>2</sub> climate). In the North Platte
  River drainage of Wyoming, Rahel et al. (1996) project losses from the present
  geographic range of cold-water fish species of from 7-16% for a 1°C increase
  to 64-79% for a 5°C increase in summer air temperatures, with considerable fragmentation
  of remaining populations. In a national study of climate-induced temperature
  effects on fish habitat, complete elimination of cold-water habitat is projected
  for sites modeled in 5 to 10 states and severe reductions in 11 to 15 states,
  depending on the GCM climate projection used (U.S. EPA, 1995). It must be noted,
  however, that most studies of warming effects on stream fish populations have
  used mean temperature increases that generally are greater than those produced
  by current models for the same time period; these later models include aerosol
  forcing and show minimal summer daytime changes and more cloud cover in summer
  for many regions. </p>
<p>Whole ecosystem experiments that alter the thermal, hydrological, or mixing
  regimes in small lakes and streams or in large-scale mesocosms (e.g., lake enclosures
  or artificial streams) are needed to determine the responses of organisms, processes,
  and habitats to global change. Additional work also is needed in the area of
  comparative studies of populations or ecological processes across latitudinal
  and hydrological gradients and ecosystem types to enable us to better understand
  climate-induced temperature effects in the context of natural seasonal and interannual
  variability. </p>
<p>In addition, qualitative projections of the consequences of climate change
  on the fish resources of North America will require good regional atmospheric
  and oceanic models of the response of the ocean to climate change; improved
  knowledge of the life histories of the most vulnerable species for which projections
  are required; and a further understanding of the roles that the environment,
  species interactions, and fishing play in determining the variability of growth,
  reproduction, and abundance of fish stocks. </p>
<p><i>If climate changes result in lower water levels, reduced runoffs, and increased
  hydrological variability, the productivity of some freshwater species may decline.
  </i></p>
<p>In areas of North America that experience significant reductions in runoff,
  lower water levels in some lakes may eliminate or reduce the productivity of
  fish species dependent on shallow near-shore zones or adjacent wetlands as spawning
  or nursery areas (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.6.2.2). Some shallow lakes with
  relatively short water residence times may disappear entirely with reduced annual
  runoff. For example, Marsh and Lesack (1996) project with a hydrological model
  that under a 2xCO<sub>2</sub> climate, many lakes in the Mackenzie delta in the Canadian
  arctic could disappear in several decades as a result of decreased precipitation
  and flooding frequency. In some lake districts, connectivity among lakes would
  be decreased by the cessation of flow in connecting streams-possibly eliminating
  species such as northern pike from some shallow-water lakes because they no
  longer have connections to deep-water lakes for winter habitat (IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Section 10.6.2.2). </p>
<p>In many areas, increases in flow variability are likely to produce larger effects
  on biota than changes in mean flows (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.6.2.1), which
  could result in some changes in ecosystem productivity and organism abundance
  (including positive and negative effects). In arid-land streams, more intense
  storms and longer periods of drought may produce severe streambank erosion,
  lower biomass and productivity, and a decline in biological interactions (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Box 10-3). In humid regions, more intense or clustered storms could
  reduce the abundance of many stream organisms via scouring of streambeds, although
  greater frequency of floodplain flooding also might increase the productivity
  of many river and stream organisms. Longer periods of drought in humid regions,
  particularly in summer, could increase the probability that streams will cease
  flowing and become dry; reductions in annual runoff also could increase the
  probability that streams will dry. In a regional analysis of U.S. streams, Poff
  (1992) projected that nearly one-half of perennial runoff streams in the eastern
  United States may become intermittent with only a 10% decline in annual runoff.
  Even if streams do not become intermittent, longer droughts and lower summer
  baseflows could result in more severe water quality deterioration (low dissolved
  oxygen concentrations, high concentrations of contaminants), which will reduce
  available habitat and eliminate intolerant species from streams (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Section 10.5.4). </p>
