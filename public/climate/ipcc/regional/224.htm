<h4>8.3.7.2.3. Protecting natural shorelines by allowing shores to retreat </h4>
<p>Several planning measures have been proposed to enable some shorelines to remain
  in roughly their natural state as sea level rises, rather than be replaced with
  structures. For the most part, these measures apply to areas that are not yet
  developed. They broadly fall into two categories: setbacks, which are regulations
  that prevent development of areas likely to be inundated, and rolling easements-which
  allow development today, but only with the explicit condition that the property
  will not be protected from rising water levels (Titus, 1997). </p>
<p>Setbacks currently are used to ensure that homes are safe from current flood
  risks. Several U.S. states currently require an additional erosion-based setback,
  in which new houses are set back an additional 20 to 60 times the annual erosion
  rate (Klarin and Hershman, 1990; Marine Law Institute et al., 1995). Eventually,
  however, the shore will erode to any setback line. Moreover, it is economically
  inefficient, and sometimes unconstitutional, to prevent the use of property
  now solely to avoid an adverse impact in the future (Titus, 1991). </p>
<p>Many of these problems are avoided with rolling easements-a planning measure
  in which coastal development is allowed in return for the property owner agreeing
  not to build structures or otherwise artificially stop the natural inland migration
  of wetlands and beaches. This option requires neither a specific estimate of
  future sea-level rise nor large public land purchases, and it is economically
  efficient because it does not prevent owners from using their land unless or
  until the sea rises enough to inundate it. The ability of the government to
  prevent property owners from eliminating the shore is grounded in the "public
  trust doctrine," under which the public has always owned tidal waters and either
  owned or had an access right along all intertidal beaches (Slade, 1990). If
  this approach were implemented in the next decade, ensuring the continued survival
  of natural wetland and beach shores in U.S. areas that are still undeveloped
  would cost approximately $400-1,200 million (Titus, 1997). </p>
<p>Texas common law recognizes rolling easements along its Gulf coast beaches.
  Maine and Rhode Island have issued regulations that prohibit structures that
  block the inland migration of wetlands. South Carolina's Beachfront Management
  Act, passed in response to the risks of a 1-ft rise in sea level, originally
  required setbacks along the coast, but in the aftermath of a trial court ruling
  that was eventually upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court (Lucas v. South Carolina
  Coastal Council), the statute was modified to require rolling easements in some
  locations<sup><a href="fn8.htm#2">2</a></sup> (South Carolina Beachfront Management
  Act, 1988). Because Canada inherited the same common law from England as the
  United States, all of these approaches could be applicable to Canada if its
  coastal zone becomes densely developed in the next century. </p>
<h4>8.3.7.2.4. National assessments of adaptive responses<a name="national"></a></h4>
<p>Several nationwide assessments have been conducted in the United States, mostly
  focusing on the potential loss of wet and dry land and the cost of holding back
  the sea. These studies have recognized that the impact of sea-level rise ultimately
  depends on whether-and how-people hold back the sea; they generally estimate
  impacts assuming alternative policies for protecting coastal land. A rise of
  50 cm would inundate 8,600-19,000 km<sup>2</sup> (3,300-7,300 mi<sub>2</sub>) of dry land if no shores
  are protected and 5,700-16,000 km<sup>2</sup> (2,200-6,100 mi<sub>2</sub>) if currently developed
  areas are protected (<a href="221.htm#table8-7">Table 8-7</a>). The loss of
  coastal wetlands would be 17-43% if no shores are protected and 20-45% if currently
  developed areas are protected-but 38-61% if all shores were protected. These
  results suggest that efforts to mitigate wetland loss from sea-level rise could
  exempt existing development and focus on areas that are still undeveloped (Titus
  et al., 1991). </p>
<p>Studies generally estimate that the cumulative cost of a 50-cm rise in sea
  level through the year 2100 would be $20-200 billion; the cost of a 1-m rise
  would be approximately twice that amount. Titus et al. (1991) estimated that
  for a 50-cm rise, barrier islands could be protected by placing sand on eroding
  beaches and the low bay sides, at a cost of $15-81 billion; elevating houses
  and roads, at a cost of $29-36 billion; and protecting mainland areas with dikes
  and bulkheads, at a cost of $5-13 billion-for a total cost of $55-123 billion.
</p>
<p>Yohe (1990) estimated that if shores were not protected, a 50-cm rise would
  inundate land and structures worth $78-188 billion; Yohe et al. (1996) estimated
  that the cost would only be $20 billion. Their lower estimate appears to have
  resulted from two differences in their study: First, rather than assuming that
  all developed areas would be protected, Yohe et al. assessed the value of land
  and structures and assumed that only areas that could be economically protected
  would be protected. Second, the two studies appear to make different assumptions
  regarding the area of developed barrier islands in the United States. The Yohe
  et al. (1996) analysis was based on a sample of the entire coast, which included
  five densely developed ocean beach resorts; Titus et al. (1991) based their
  estimates on an assessment by Leatherman (1989)-who examined every beach community
  between New Jersey and the Mexican border, as well as in California, along with
  one site in each of the other states. </p>
