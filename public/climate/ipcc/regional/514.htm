<h1>Temperate Asia</h1>
<p>Temperate Asia includes countries in Asia between 18ï¿½N and the Arctic Circle,
  including the Japanese islands, the Korean peninsula, Mongolia, most parts of
  China, and Russian Siberia. The east-west distance of the area is about 8,000
  km, and its north-south extent is about 5,000 km. Distinct subregions include
  arid/semi-arid, monsoonal, and Siberian regions. </p>
<p><i>Ecosystems</i>: Although the area of potential distribution of temperate
  forests in Temperate Asia is, to a large extent, cleared and used for intensive
  agriculture, global climate change can be considered sufficient to trigger structural
  changes in the remaining temperate forests. The nature and magnitude of these
  changes, however, depend on associated changes in water availability, as well
  as water-use efficiency. Shifts in temperature and precipitation in temperate
  rangelands may result in altered growing seasons and boundary shifts between
  grasslands, forests, and shrublands. Some model studies suggest that in a doubled
  CO<sub>2</sub> climate there would be a large reduction in the area (up to 50%) and productivity
  of boreal forests (primarily in the Russian Federation), accompanied by a significant
  expansion of grasslands and shrublands. There also would be a decrease in the
  area of the tundra zone of as much as 50%-accompanied by the release of methane
  from deep peat deposits-and an increase (less than 25%), in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. </p>
<p><i>Hydrology and Water Resources</i>: Overall, most 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium scenario
  simulations show a decrease in water supply, except in a few river basins. Warmer
  winters may affect water balances because water demands are higher in spring
  and summer. Equilibrium climate conditions for doubled equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations
  indicate that a decrease of as much as 25% in mountain glacier mass is possible
  by 2050. Initially, runoff from glaciers in central Asia is projected to increase
  threefold by 2050, but by 2100 glacier runoff would taper to two-thirds of its
  present value. Model results suggest that runoff in the northern part of China
  is quite vulnerable to climate change, mainly as a consequence of changes in
  precipitation in spring, summer, and autumn, especially during the flood season.
  To balance water supply with water demand, increasingly efficient water management
  is likely the best approach for Japan. In other parts of Temperate Asia, water-resource
  development will remain important; the central adaptation issue is how the design
  of new water-resource infrastructure should be adjusted to account for uncertainties
  resulting from climate change. The most critical uncertainties are the lack
  of credible projections of the effects of global change on the Asian monsoon
  or the ENSO phenomenon, which have great influence on river runoffs. Multiple-stress
  impact studies on water resources in international river basins are needed in
  the future. </p>
<p><i>Food and Fiber Production</i>: Projected changes in crop yields using climate
  projections from different GCMs vary widely. In China, for example, across different
  scenarios and different sites, the changes for several crop yields by 2050 are
  projected to be: rice, -78% to +15%; wheat, -21% to +55%; and maize, -19% to
  +5%. An increase in productivity may occur if the positive effects of CO<sub>2</sub> on
  crop growth are considered, but its magnitude remains uncertain. A northward
  shift of crop zones is expected to increase agricultural productivity in northern
  Siberia but to decrease (by about 25%) grain production in southWestern Siberia
  because of a more arid climate. Aquaculture is particularly important to Temperate
  Asia. Greater cultivation of warm-water species could develop. Warming will
  require greater attention to possible oxygen depletion, fish diseases, and introduction
  of unwanted species, as well as to potential negative factors such as changes
  in established reproductive patterns, migration routes, and ecosystem relationships.
</p>
<p><i>Coastal Systems</i>: An increase in sea level will exacerbate the current
  severe problems of tectonically and anthropogenically induced land subsidence
  in delta areas. Saltwater intrusion also would become more serious. A sea-level
  rise of 1 m would threaten certain coastal areas-for example, the Japanese coastal
  zone, on which 50% of Japan's industrial production is located (e.g., Tokyo,
  Osaka, and Nagoya); in addition, about 90% of the remaining sandy beaches in
  Japan would be in danger of disappearing. </p>
<p><i>Human Health</i>: Heat-stress mortality and illness (predominantly cardiorespiratory)
  are projected to more than double by 2050 resulting from an increase in the
  frequency or severity of heat waves under climate-change conditions projected
  by a transient GCM (GFDL X2, UKMO X6). Net climate change-related increases
  in the geographic distribution (elevation and latitude) of the vector organisms
  of infectious diseases (e.g., malarial mosquitoes, schistosome-spreading snails)
  and changes in the life-cycle dynamics of vectors and infective parasites would,
  in aggregate, increase the potential transmission of many vector-borne diseases.
  Increases in nonvector-borne infectious diseases-such as cholera, salmonellosis,
  and other food- and water-related infections-also could occur because of climatic
  impacts on water distribution, temperature, and microorganism proliferation.
  Disease surveillance could be strengthened and integrated with other environmental
  monitoring to design early warning systems; develop early, environmentally sound
  public health interventions; and develop anticipatory societal policies to reduce
  the risk of outbreaks and subsequent spread of epidemics. </p>
<p><i>Conclusions</i>: The major impacts in Temperate Asia under global climate
  change are projected to be large shifts of the boreal forests, the disappearance
  of significant portions of mountain glaciers, and water supply shortages. The
  most critical uncertainty in these estimates stems from the lack of credible
  projections of the hydrological cycle under global climate change scenarios.
  The effects of climate change on the Asian monsoon and the ENSO phenomenon are
  among the major uncertainties in the modeling of the hydrological cycle. Projections
  of agricultural crop yields are uncertain, not only because of the uncertainty
  in the hydrological cycle but also because of the potential positive effects
  of CO<sub>2</sub> and production practices. Sea-level rise endangers sandy beaches in the
  coastal zones, but remains an anthropogenically induced problem in delta areas.
  Integrated impact studies considering multi-stress factors are needed. </p>
