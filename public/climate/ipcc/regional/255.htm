<h4>9.3.7.2. Tourism </h4>
<p>Tourism is one of the most important sectors of the economies of many small
  island states in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific and Indian Oceans; the industry
  is equally important to the Mediterranean island of Malta. In some Caribbean
  countries, the annual number of long-staying visitors (i.e., excluding cruise
  ship arrivals) far exceeds the size of the resident population; in some cases,
  the ratio of tourists to residents is greater than 2:1 (e.g., approximately
  3:1 in Antigua and almost 6:1 in the Bahamas; see Caribbean Tourism Organization,
  1996). Tourism also is the largest single contributor to GNP in many islands.
  In 1995, for instance, this sector accounted for 69% and 53% of GNP in the Caribbean
  islands of Antigua and the Bahamas, respectively, and more than 10% in most
  other islands in the region. Tourism also earns valuable foreign exchange for
  these islands; the sector earned US$180 million in 1995 in the Maldives-more
  than 70% of the country's total foreign exchange earnings for that year. Moreover,
  tourism generates significant employment in many islands, such as the Bahamas-where
  three-quarters of the labor force is employed, directly or indirectly, in providing
  services to the industry (<a href="#box9-5">Box 9-5</a>). <br>

  Tourism is so vital to many small island societies that when there is contraction
  in the industry (and, hence, reduced earnings), the rate of national economic
  growth often declines. In such circumstances, provision of many essential services
  would be jeopardized, and other vital sectors (e.g., health, education, and
  welfare)-whose budgetary allocations may be influenced by tourism earnings-also
  may be affected. </p>
<p>Climate affects tourism in many ways, directly and indirectly. Loss of beaches
  to erosion; inundation; degradation of ecosystems and related impacts (e.g.,
  loss of coral reefs to bleaching, saline intrusion); and damage to critical
  infrastructure are only a few consequences that could undermine the tourism
  resource base of vulnerable small island states (Alm et al., 1993). Although
  some of these impacts also can be triggered by non-climate-related factors,
  there is a growing consensus that climate change is likely to precipitate such
  changes, and that they would be disruptive (Holthus et al., 1992; Pernetta,
  1992; Sestini, 1992; IPCC, 1996, WG II, Box 9-3; SPREP, 1996). There is evidence
  that any such dislocation in the tourism sector would have severe repercussions
  for the economic, political, and sociocultural life of many small islands. </p>
