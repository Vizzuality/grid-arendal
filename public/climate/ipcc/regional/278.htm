<h4>10.3.1.2. Agriculture </h4>
<p>Three subregions in north China appear to be especially sensitive to climate
  change because of potential increases in the soil moisture deficit: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Areas along the Great Wall</i>-This area lies southeast of the transition
    belt between agriculture and animal husbandry. Warming and increased evapotranspiration,
    along with possible declines in precipitation, would make it difficult to
    maintain current crop patterns. The northern rangeland would gradually intrude
    into this area, creating a transition zone dominated by livestock. The northWestern
    part of this area would become an arid grassland.</li>
  <li><i>The Huang-Hai plains</i>-Climatic warming may increase the moisture deficit
    (i.e., the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration) by more
    than 70 mm and result in more frequent and severe spring droughts with hot,
    dry winds, damaging wheat production and limiting the present practice of
    double-cropping in succession. Dryland crops will suffer from drought.</li>
  <li><i>The area north of the Huaihe River, including eastern Shandong</i>-This
    area lies along the southern edge of the temperate crop zone. Climate warming
    may cause the northward shift of subtropical crop areas. However, projected
    frequent waterlogging in the south and spring droughts in the north would
    inhibit the growth of subtropical crops.</li>
</ul>
<p>The state and farmers can take steps to adapt agricultural production to the
  unfavorable impacts of possible climate change. Such strategies include allowing
  the sown acreage of grain to stabilize at a level of 0.8-0.9 ha per capita to
  attain the production target; strengthening irrigation capacity as one of the
  most beneficial means of maintaining agricultural production in the face of
  unfavorable climate change; and transforming medium- or low-yield farmland into
  high-yield farmland. To maintain the productivity of cultivated land, it is
  necessary to popularize a more optimal fertilizer mix and adopt the technique
  of subsoil application according to actual changes in soil conditions. It also
  is necessary to use and extend technology for agricultural adaptability-such
  as using superior species of crops, improving standardized cultural techniques
  under climatic variation, using dryland farming techniques, and developing feed
  crops instead of grain crops. </p>
<h4>10.3.1.3. Forests<a name="forests"></a> </h4>
<p>Forests in northern China have been seriously depleted over the past few centuries.
  Despite recent reforestation efforts, the forested area in the region is only
  11.8% of the total land cover, which is lower than the mean value for China.
  Under the influence of projected climate change, the distribution pattern of
  many important tree species would be affected. For example, the present forests
  of Pinus tabulaeformis, a key temperate species widely distributed in northern
  China, will be reduced an additional 9.4% under a 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium climate
  (Guo, 1995). </p>
<h4>10.3.1.4. Coastal Zones<a name="coast"></a> </h4>
<p>For the southern coast of Shangdong, estimated sea-level rise by the years
  2030, 2050, and 2100 would be 1.1, 5.7, and 40.2 cm, respectively and, for the
  coast of Liaoning-Tianjin, 13.1, 22.5, and 69.0 cm, respectively (Du et al.,
  1996). Construction of dikes and seawalls is likely to be the most common adaptation
  strategy in these areas; this practice has been used there throughout history
  to combat sea encroachment (ESD-CAS, 1994). <br>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 10-2.</b><a name="box10-2"></a> Sea-Level Rise at Major Deltas of China (ESD-CAS,

  <tr>
    <td>The Old Huanghe (Yellow River) delta, the Changjiang (Yangtze River) delta,
      and the Zhujiang (Pearl River) delta are major areas of economic activity
      in China. The metropolises of Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou (Canton)
      are located within these three deltas, respectively. The three deltas are
      located in regions with tectonic subsidence rates of about 2-3 mm/yr, 1-2
      mm/yr, and 1-2 mm/yr, respectively (although hilly lands in the Zhujiang
      delta have a tectonic uplifting rate of 1 mm/yr). The Old Huanghe delta
      and the Changjiang delta have experienced severe land subsidence problems
      in the past as a result of groundwater extraction. Recent efforts to mitigate
      this problem have been successful in reducing the subsidence rate. It is
      estimated that these rates can be controlled within the range of 6-10 mm/yr
      for the Old Huanghe delta and 3-5 mm/yr for the Changjiang delta. In the
      Zhujiang delta, natural progradation of the coast and active land reclamation
      activities have resulted in a 0.5-1 mm/yr sea-level rise in the distributaries
      in the estuarine area-the same order of magnitude as the projected value
      due to climate change. This rate is expected to continue for some time.
      In the next 50 years, therefore, the expected eustatic sea-level rise due
      to climate change will not be a major factor in relative sea-level rise
      for the Old Huanghe and Changjiang deltas, although it may be for the Zhujiang
      delta.</td>
