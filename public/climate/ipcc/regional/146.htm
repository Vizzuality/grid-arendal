<h4>6.3.6. Human Settlements</h4>
<p>In Latin America, the region with the largest urbanization rate, a large spectrum
  of urban settlements has been established at different elevations (from sea
  level to mountain ranges exceeding 3,000 m). These locations have a wide variety
  of geographic and topographic characteristics (see <a href="125.htm#figure6-1">Figure
  6-1</a>). Because weather and climate events already are affecting environmental
  conditions, climate change may be expected to have a host of direct and indirect
  effects on human settlements, even where urban migration is not a factor. However,
  such migration is significant in some countries of the region. In fact, large
  groups of people migrate internally and regionally from rural, drought-prone
  areas (Ezcurra, 1990) or poverty stricken communities (Canziani, 1996) to modern,
  well-developed cities. Unemployment rates indicate that this tendency will continue,
  particularly because cities and urban/industrial/commercial nuclei in Latin
  America offer better opportunities for employment than do those in other regions.
  Such cities may become the kernels of Latin American megalopolises, attracting
  people from less-developed neighboring countries as well as from within. Population
  displacements are likely to have serious socioeconomic and cultural as well
  as health implications (also see <a href="143.htm">Section 6.3.5</a>). More
  than one poverty belt, such as those in the metropolitan areas of some Latin
  American cities, may arise around a single city. </p>
<p>Latin American cities already suffer from the impacts of sea-level rise, adverse
  weather, and extreme climate conditions (e.g., floods, flash floods, windstorms,
  landslides, and cold and heat outbreaks). They also suffer from indirect effects
  through impacts on other sectors, such as water supply, energy distribution,
  transportation, agriculture, and sanitation services. Thresholds beyond which
  impacts escalate quickly are unique to local situations and tend to depend on
  the degree of preparedness for adaptive response (e.g., warning and alert systems
  and procedures; traffic rerouting procedures; flexible welfare systems) (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 12.2). </p>
<p>Global warming can be expected to further affect the availability of water
  resources and biomass (for charcoal and fuel production), both of which are
  important energy sources in many Latin American countries. Water and biomass
  resources already are under stress in many of these areas as a result of rising
  demand, which will increase because of the urban migration trend. The increasing
  urban population in the region also has generated difficulties in providing
  water of adequate quality to urban residents. In most cities, piped drinking
  water and sewage services are not available to everyone. In the Buenos Aires
  metropolitan area, about 55% of the population obtains its drinking water from
  underground sources-some of which have serious levels of contamination from
  industrial waste dumps, agrochemicals, and, particularly, precarious sewage
  systems consisting of pozos negros (excreta and fecal holes) (Gonz�lez, 1990;
  De Filippi et al., 1994). </p>
<p>In mountain regions, hundreds of thousands of people live in precarious settlements
  on potentially unstable hillsides that are especially vulnerable to climatic
  impacts. In recent decades, hundreds of people have been killed or seriously
  injured and thousands left homeless by landslides in Rio de Janeiro, Guatemala
  City, Medell�n, Mendoza, Mexico City, Santos, and Sao Paulo (WHO Commission
  on Human Health and Environment, 1992; Aguilar and Sanchez, 1993), as well as
  Caracas (Hardoy et al., 1992). Shantytowns (barriadas, favelas, or villas miseria)
  surrounding large cities in the region sometimes are established in the drainage
  valleys of rivers and streams-where flooding frequency already is increasing
  as a result of climatic variability (Canziani, 1996) and might be exacerbated
  as a result of global warming. Flooding and landslides have adverse effects
  on the welfare and health conditions of poorer communities. </p>
<p>Nonclimatic effects may be more important than climate change. Local environmental
  and socioeconomic situations are changing rapidly; the living standards of millions
  of people in Latin America are lower now than they were in the early 1970s.
  Poverty has become an increasingly urban phenomenon in recent decades. Migrants
  tend to live in informal, peri-urban settlements with serious infrastructure
  problems-ranging from unhealthy environments and water supplies and lack of
  sewage systems to difficult access to energy, transportation, communications,
  and even decent shelter. Some informal settlements around large Latin American
  cities, especially around the capital cities, are homes for many hundreds of
  thousands of people, leading to impacts on human health (see <a href="143.htm">Section
  6.3.5</a>). </p>
