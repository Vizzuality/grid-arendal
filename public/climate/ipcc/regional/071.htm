<h4>4.3.1.6. Adaptation and Vulnerability </h4>
<p>Adaptations to climate change may be categorized as either "autonomous" adaptations-where
  biota and ecosystems respond and change of their own accord-or "planned" or
  "conscious" adaptations, undertaken by humans. The primary option for conscious
  adaptation measures in respect to near-natural ecosystems is land-use management.
  This includes modification of land clearing, forestry practices, fire management,
  rangeland animal stocking rates, pest animal management, control of herbaceous
  and woody weeds, development of corridors for species migration, resting and
  rehabilitating degraded areas, and the consideration of climate change in management
  plans for urban, coastal, catchment, and other zones. Implementation of riparian
  (riverside) management practices and selective planting of upslope source areas
  would mitigate many of the adverse impacts of land development and hydrological
  changes on water quality and habitat values of streams, rivers, and ultimately
  lake and estuarine habitats. Active manipulation of species generally will not
  be feasible in the region's extensive, lightly managed, natural ecosystems,
  though in some circumstances-such as for endangered or commercially important
  species-relocation to new and more suitable habitats may be desirable and feasible.
</p>
<p>Continued research on natural ecosystems also is a necessary, integral part
  of adaptation responses. In many instances, our knowledge is insufficient to
  provide the guidance sought by managers and policymakers. Routine climatic,
  environmental, and ecological monitoring and prediction also are necessary.
</p>
<p>In summary, it must be concluded that some of the region's species and ecosystems
  are rather vulnerable to climate change because of the likely continued increase
  of greenhouse gases; the likely rate of climate change; the fundamental nature
  of likely changes to biota and ecosystems; the large proportion of Australasia
  affected; the ecological isolation and fragmentation of ecosystems of the region;
  existing environmental stresses; and the limited available options for conscious
  adaptation. </p>
<h4>4.3.2. Hydrology and Water Resources<a name="hydro"></a> </h4>
<p><i>Summary: The four hydrological situations of most concern to the region
  are drought-prone areas, flood-prone urban areas, low-lying islands, and alpine
  snowfields. Model simulations suggest changes of as much as ï¿½20% in soil moisture
  and runoff in Australia by 2030, with considerable variation from place to place
  and season to season and with the possibility of an overall reduction in average
  runoff. Water shortages would sharpen competition among various uses of water,
  especially where large diversions are made for economic purposes. One study
  shows Australia's major Murray-Darling River system facing constraints on existing
  irrigation uses and/or harm to the riverine environment. More frequent high-rainfall
  events would enhance groundwater recharge and dam-filling events but also would
  increase the impacts of flooding, landslides, and erosion. A preliminary study
  for an urban area near Sydney showed a tenfold increase in the potential damage
  of the "100-year" flood under a doubled CO<sub>2</sub> scenario. Water supplies on atolls
  and low-lying islands are vulnerable to saltwater intrusion of groundwater from
  rising sea levels and to possible rainfall reductions. Reduced snow amounts
  and a shorter snow season appear likely and would decrease the amenity value
  of the mountains and the viability of the ski industry. The glaciers of New
  Zealand's Southern Alps are likely to shrink further.</i> </p>
<p><i>Adaptation options include integrated catchment management, changes to water
  pricing systems, water efficiency initiatives, building or rebuilding engineering
  structures, relocation of buildings, urban planning and management, and improved
  water supply measures in remote areas and low-lying islands. The financial exposure,
  and cost involved in potential adaptations, indicate a high vulnerability with
  respect to hydrology.</i> </p>
