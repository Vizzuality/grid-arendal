      <p>African Great Lakes are sensitive to climate variation on time scales
	of decades to millennia (Kendall, 1969; Livingstone, 1975; Haberyan and
	Hecky, 1987). Lake Victoria (the world's second-largest freshwater lake
	by area), Lake Tanganyika (the world's second-deepest lake), and Lake
	Malawi were closed basins for extended periods in the Pleistocene and
	Holocene epochs (Owen et al., 1990). Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika were
	hundreds of meters below their current levels; Victoria dried out completely.
	Today these lakes are in delicate hydrological balance and are nearly
	closed. Only 6% of the water input to Tanganyika leaves at its riverine
	outflow (which was totally blocked when the lake was explored by Europeans)
	(Bootsma and Hecky, 1993). </p>
      <p>Higher temperatures would increase evaporative losses, especially if
	rainfall also declined. Minor declines in mean annual rainfall (10-20%)
	for extended periods would lead to the closure of these basins even if
	temperatures were unchanged (Bootsma and Hecky, 1993). Tropical temperatures
	are increasing; temperatures in the 1980s were 0.5�C warmer than a century
	earlier and 0.3�C warmer than during the period 1951-1980. Concurrently,
	Lake Victoria's epilimnion was warmer by 0.5�C in the early 1990s than
	in the 1960s (Hecky et al., 1994). Although current climate scenarios
	project only small increases in tropical temperatures, small changes in
	temperature and water balance can dramatically alter water levels, as
	well as mixing regimes and productivity. </p>
      <p>Recent temperature and rainfall data and GCM simulations indicate increasing
	aridity in the tropics (Rind, 1995). Increases of 1-2�C in air temperatures
	could substantially increase the stability of stratification in permanently
	stratified Tanganyika and Malawi. Their deep waters are continuously warm,
	but the <1�C difference between surface and deep water in warm seasons
	maintains a density difference that prevents full circulation. Lake Tanganyika's
	deep water has been characterized as a "relict" hypolimnion that formed
	under a cooler climate within the past 1,000 years (Hecky et al., 1994).
	Since then, warming has created a barrier to vertical circulation. Additional
	warming could strengthen this barrier and reduce the mixing of deep, nutrient-rich
	hypolimnetic water and nutrient-depleted surface layers; that mixing sustains
	one of the most productive freshwater fisheries in the world (Hecky et
	al., 1981). </p>

  2.3.2.2. Water Supply<a name="2.3.2.2"></a></h4>
<p>Water supply undoubtedly is a most important resource for Africa's social,
  economic, and environmental well-being. Currently, about two-thirds of the rural
  population and one-quarter of the urban population are without safe drinking
  water, and even higher proportions lack proper sanitation. Climate change will
  likely make the situation more adverse. The greatest impact will continue to
  be felt by the poor, who have the most limited access to water resources. This
  section focuses mainly on sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). <br>

  Availability of water in SSA is highly variable. Only the humid tropical zones
  in central and west Africa have abundant water. Availability of water varies
  considerably within countries, too, influenced by physical characteristics and
  seasonal patterns of rainfall. According to Sharma et al. (1996), eight countries
  were suffering from water stress or scarcity in 1990; this situation is getting
  worse as a consequence of rapid population growth, expanding urbanization, and
  increased economic development. By 2000, about 300 million Africans risk living
  in a water-scarce environment. Moreover, by 2025, the number of countries experiencing
  water stress will rise to 18-affecting 600 million people (World Bank, 1995b).
  <a href="#figure2-10">Figure 2-10</a> shows how countries will shift from water
  surplus to water scarcity as a result of population changes alone between 1990
  and 2025, using a per capita water-scarcity limit of 1,000 m<sup>3</sup>/yr. The scarcity
  statistics also can be associated with challenges to international water resources:
  Eight river basins already face water stress, and four face scarcity (<a href="#figure2-11">Figure
  2-11</a>); <a href="#figure2-12">Figure 2-12</a> illustrates water availability
  in the year 2025 (taking account of population increase alone) (Sharma et al.,
  1996). <br>

  During the 1980s and 1990s, drought affected urban areas and industry very
  severely. Most water-dependent industries in southern Africa were forced to
  reduce their activities after water reservoirs fell to critical levels. Beverage
  companies, which use a lot of water to wash bottles, had to change to nonreturnable
  aluminum cans (which require less water). Botswana's construction and textile
  industries had to retrench workers after operations were scaled down because
  of a severe shortage of water. Similar problems hit Bulawayo, the heart of Zimbabwe's
  industrial sector; companies were almost forced to pull out and relocate elsewhere
  because of a lack of water, and half of the small businesses crumbled. In South
  Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe, sugarcane industries almost ground to a halt
  because there was no water for irrigation. Power rationing in Kenya in 1996-97
  as a consequence of drought severely disrupted the country's manufacturing and
  engineering industries (UNEP, 1997). </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are few assessments of how climate change or responses
  to it could affect local wetland biodiversity. The climate change scenarios
  of Greco et al. (1994) project that there could be less water in most of the
  large rivers in the Sahel over the next 30-60 years, with the possible exception
  of the major rivers flowing into Lake Chad. This shift would mean less available
  water in the large wetlands along these rivers, unless there are changes to
  the management of outflow from dams. Changes to the hydrology of smaller wetlands
  will depend not only on climate change but also on whether they are supplied
  with surface water or groundwater, as well as the extent of cropping in their
  catchment areas. The loss of small wetlands may lead to a significant risk of
  extinction for local populations of turtles and small birds (Gibbs, 1993), although
  taxa that are easily transported as adults, eggs, cysts, larvae, and so forth
  would be subjected to less risk (Magadza, 1991). If wetlands in the eastern
  Sahel become drier, relatively mobile birds that are dependent on wetland habitat
  could move into wetlands further east (i.e., in Niger, northern Nigeria, northern
  Cameroon, Chad). </p>
