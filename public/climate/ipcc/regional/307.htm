<h1>Annex B: Simulation of Regional Climate Change with Global Coupled Climate Models and Regional Modeling Techniques</h1>
<p>In IPCC (1990) and IPCC (1992), very low confidence was placed on the climate
  change scenarios produced by general circulation model (GCM) equilibrium experiments
  on the sub-continental, or regional, scale (order of 105-107 km<sup>2</sup>). This was
  mainly attributed to coarse model resolution, limitations in model physics representations,
  errors in model simulation of present-day regional climate features, and wide
  inter-model range of simulated regional change scenarios. Since then, transient
  runs with Atmosphere-Ocean GCMs (AOGCMs) have become available that allow a
  similar regional analysis. In addition, different regionalization techniques
  have been developed and tested in recent years to improve the simulation of
  regional climate change. This section examines regional change scenarios produced
  by new coupled GCM runs. Following the 1990 and 1992 reports, emphasis is placed
  on the simulation of seasonally averaged surface air temperature and precipitation,
  although the importance of higher order statistics and other surface climate
  variables for impact assessment is recognized (Kittel et al., 1995; Mearns et
  al., 1995a,b). </p>
<h1>B.1. Regional Simulations by GCMs </h1>
<p>In IPCC (1990), five regions were identified for analysis of regional climate
  change simulation: Central North America (CNA; 35-50°N, 85-105°W), South East
  Asia (SEA; 5-30°N, 70-105°E), Sahel (Africa) (SAH; 10-20°N, 20°W-40°E), Southern
  Europe (SEU; 35-50°N, 10 W- 45°E), and Australia (AUS; 12-45°S, 110-155°E).
  Output from different coupled model runs with dynamical oceans for these regions
  was analyzed by Cubash et al. (1994a), Whetton et al. (1996), and Kittel et
  al. (1997), while analysis over the Australian region from equilibrium simulations
  with mixed-layer ocean models was performed by Whetton et al. (1994). Results
  over two additional regions were analyzed by Raisanen (1995) for Northern Europe
  (NEU; land areas north of 50°N and west of 60°E) and Li et al. (1994) for East
  Asia (EAS; 15-60°N, 70-140°E). To summarize the findings of these works, <a href="#figureB-1">Figure
  B-1</a> shows differences between region-average values at the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling
  and for the control run, and differences between control run averages and observations
  (hereafter referred to as bias), for winter and summer surface air temperature
  and precipitation. Note that these models contain increases of CO<sub>2</sub> only. Experiments
  including increased CO<sub>2</sub> and the effects of sulfate aerosols will be discussed
  later. <br>

      and control run averages (CO<sub>2</sub>-Control) and difference between control run
      averages and observed averages (Control-Observed) as simulated by nine AOGCM
      runs over seven regions. Units are °C for temperature and percentage of
      control run, or observed, averages for precipitation. In (f) and (h), values
      in excess of 200% have been reported at the top end of the vertical scale.
      In (e), values in excess of 60% have been reported at the top end of the
      vertical scale. Winter averages are for December-January-February (DJF)
      for Northern Hemisphere regions, and June-July-August (JJA) for Australia;
      summer averages are for JJA for the Northern Hemisphere, and DJF for Australia.

  The biases are presented as a reference for the interpretation of the scenarios,
  because it can be generally expected that the better the match between control
  run and observed climate (i.e., the lower the biases), the higher the confidence
  in simulated change scenarios. The model runs are labeled d, g, m, x, p, q,
  r, s, and t as shown in the legend of the figure. Letter designations here refer
  to model descriptions in <a href="308.htm#tableB-1">Table B-1</a>. Note also
  in <a href="308.htm#tableB-1">Table B-1</a> that the models employ different
  spatial resolutions and flux adjustments. </p>
