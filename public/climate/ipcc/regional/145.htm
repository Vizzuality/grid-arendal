<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>In the recent past, irrigation schemes and agricultural changes in Central
  America, which have been associated with an increased resistance of vectors
  to insecticides, have brought an increase in new cases of malaria. The most
  severe outbreaks, however, are registered in Brazil (particularly in the Amazon
  basin)-where more than 50% of malaria cases in the Americas are reported, including
  6,000-10,000 deaths per year, as a consequence of new settlements and mining
  activities developed in unhealthy locations of the Amazon forest (WHO, 1993).
</p>
<p>Dengue and yellow fever involve similar viruses and epidemiology; they are
  transmitted by the same urban vector, the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito. Although
  this species is recognized as the main vector, another (<i>Aedes albopictus</i>)
  has invaded the American continent, colonizing the United States and Brazil.
  In Latin America, dengue currently is more active than yellow fever. Dengue
  is a severe, influenza-like virus; it sometimes takes the form of hemorragic
  fever, and it is lethal about 15% of the time. Studies performed in Mexico have
  shown that an increase of 3-4°C in mean temperatures may double the transmission
  rate (Koopman et al., 1991), and transmission is common in areas with temperatures
  below 20°C (Halstead, 1990). Cases of dengue at 1,700 m above sea level-an elevation
  never before attained-were found in the state of Guerrero (Herrera-Basto et
  al., 1992) and have since been found at even higher elevations in other regions.
  Apparently, the thermal limit of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> could be a midwinter temperature
  of 10°C (Shope, 1991). Junin et al. (1995) reported re-infestation of the city
  of Buenos Aires by this species-after 30 years of formally declared erradication.
  Temperature is considered to be a predictor of dengue outbreaks. Martens et
  al. (1997) have identified epidemiological areas too cold for the transmission
  of the virus, including those at the current temperature of Mexico City. </p>
<p>Chagas' disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is a parasitic disease produced
  by the flagellate <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>. This infection is one of the most
  important public health scourges in Latin America. It affects the human digestive
  and nervous systems and especially the heart. Its vectors span latitudes from
  42°N to 46°S, with an elevational dispersion ranging from sea level to about
  4,100 m above sea level (Bejarano, 1967). However, the disease's endemic area
  is much smaller; it is confined mainly to tropical and subtropical regions,
  especially in poverty-stricken areas. Triatoma infestans-the most important
  vector of <i>Tripanosoma cruzi</i>-is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,
  Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. Most of the population of this vector lives within
  or around human habitats, particularly in poor rural dwellings that have mud
  walls and roofs made of tree branches, straw, or palm leaves. Colonies also
  exist outdoors in places with cold winters and warm summers (Carcavallo and
  Martinez, 1972). Climate change may influence the population dynamics of vectors
  (Hack, 1955; Burgos et al., 1994), as well as the number of blood-feedings and,
  therefore, the possibilities of infective indirect contacts (Catala, 1991; Catala
  et al., 1992). </p>
<p>The region also is affected by some rickettsial diseases, which are transmitted
  by ticks and have wild mammals as reservoirs. They could become increasingly
  important under climate change because they facilitate the coexistence of every
  link on the epidemiological chain. </p>
<p>Another indirect effect of climate change on human health would be the threat
  to food production (Rosenzweig et al., 1993; Reilly et al., 1994)-particularly
  among populations already living in marginal conditions, which have minimal
  capacity for adaptive changes (Leemans, 1992). For example, climate variability
  and change could increase the adverse effects of plant and animal pests and
  diseases on the quality and quantity of food production. The ENSO phenomenon
  has had similar effects on anchovy and sardine fishing and the related fishmeal
  industry, both of which are important for human and livestock diets. </p>
