<p>These integrated models provide flexible, evolving tools for comprehensive
  assessments of vulnerability and adaptation options. They are especially useful
  in performing "diagnostic" analyses of environmental and socioeconomic sensitivities
  to climate change and variability under the shadow of the large scientific uncertainties
  in GCM-based predictions of regional climate change. </p>
<p>Another way to estimate integrated effects is to calculate a comprehensive
  monetary estimate, where all known impacts are expressed in a dollar value and
  then added (IPCC 1996, WG III, Chapter 6). There is considerable room for criticism
  of this method's assumptions, data, and results. Shortcomings aside, however,
  the estimates available for the Australasian region using this approach indicate
  very significant impacts on total GDP (See <a href="#box4-3">Box 4-3</a>). <br>

      <p>In principle, the total potential economic impact of climate change on
	the world (or a region or country) can be found by deriving a comprehensive
	monetary estimate-where all of the known impacts, positive and negative,
	are expressed in a dollar value and combined (IPCC 1996, WG III, Section
	6.1.2.). For marketed goods and services (for example, increased agricultural
	production, land loss due to sea-level rise, or energy savings in winter),
	this calculation is more or less straightforward because the prices are
	known. In the case of nonmarketed goods and services (for example, wetland
	loss or mortality changes), monetary estimates of impacts can be obtained
	through examining market transactions where such goods or services are
	implicitly traded (e.g., the higher price of a house with a good view)
	or through interviewing people for their preferences. That is, human preferences
	are expressed by people's willingness to pay to secure a benefit or their
	willingness to accept compensation in exchange for a loss. In OECD countries,
	such valuation techniques are well established and have been widely applied.
      </p>
      <p>When applied to agriculture, energy, water supply, sea-level rise, mortality,
	and species losses, the method shows that with an equilibrium doubling
	of CO<sub>2</sub>, the impacts amount to an annual reduction of several percent of
	GDP in many regions of the world (IPCC 1996, WG III, Section 6.2.15).
	The calculations are carried out under current economic conditions and
	include some account of international trade effects in agriculture but
	not of interactions between the different impacts or adaptation responses.
	It should be noted that these results have been strongly criticized-first
	on the basis of inadequate representation of the full range of impacts
	and second because many researchers hold the view that the importance
	of nonmarket goods, especially lives and quality of life, cannot be expressed
	in monetary terms. </p>
      <p>Updated values of the SAR estimates of the annual impact for Australia
	and New Zealand combined fall in the range of -1.2% to -3.8% of GDP, depending
	on economic model assumptions (Fankhauser and Tol, 1997). The real uncertainty
	in these estimates is much greater than the range given. Most of the impact
	arises from health and environmental effects, which do not appear in national
	economic accounts. At face value, these figures indicate substantial negative
	effects on Australasia's economy. Furthermore, they may seriously underestimate
	the true total impact because they do not include a number of impacts
	that are potentially important to Australasia-such as changes in weeds,
	pests, and diseases; storm surges; and urban flooding. In addition, damages
	may increase nonlinearly with increased global warming, so the impacts
	and costs could rise faster than the rate of warming. On the other hand,
	adaptations to climate change, which will act to reduce total costs, also
	are not included in the calculations.</p>

  The Australasian region is subject to high climate variability, especially
  associated with the ENSO phenomenon. Therefore, a better understanding of how
  the region's unique ecosystems are affected by climate variability, extremes,
  and chaotic sequences of climate conditions-as well as small, slow changes in
  mean conditions-is needed to enable us to understand how ecosystems might respond
  to future changes in this variability. The issues of climate variability; time
  characteristics of physical and biological components of ecosystems, including
  hydrology, soils, and weeds; and the resulting dynamic, nonlinear behavior of
  ecosystems are key issues, both generally and for predicting the impacts of
  climate change. </p>
<p>Research also is needed on vulnerability to present-day climate fluctuations
  in the region and on how people and systems respond to and cope with these fluctuations.
  The emerging ability to predict interannual climate variations, especially those
  arising from the ENSO phenomenon, and to use those predictions to optimize management
  strategies (McKeon and Howden, 1993; Stone et al., 1993) is an example of an
  approach that not only serves immediate needs but also can become a tool for
  adaptation to long-term change. </p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand also are extremely vulnerable to international influences
  arising from climate change: through their high levels of international trade
  in food commodities whose supply, demand, and prices will alter in a warmer
  world; from climate-mediated risks of imported biological pests and diseases
  that have the potential to decimate food production systems; from the consequences
  of international greenhouse gas mitigation policies on the region's coal industry,
  energy-intensive industries (transport fuels, smelting), and possibly agricultural
  industry; and through their special responsibilities to assist South Pacific
  island communities in the event of climatic disaster and loss of habitability.
</p>
<p>To improve the prediction of climate change impacts for Australasia, additional
  research and information is needed on more accurate and region-specific climate
  scenarios; the dynamics and internal interactions of ecological systems, as
  noted above; impacts on marine, aquatic, and coastal ecosystems; possible changes
  to the magnitude and frequency of "natural disasters" such as droughts, floods,
  tropical cyclones, fire, and extreme sea-level events (Pittock et al., 1997);
  impacts and costs for human activities (settlements, industries, and health);
  cross-sector and multinational interactions; and potential adaptation options
  (Henderson-Sellers, 1996) and their impact-ameliorating effects. </p>
<p>In broad summary, climate change impacts in Australia are likely to be dominated
  by the following factors. Some of these factors are more similar to those operating
  in low-latitude developing countries than to those in the more developed countries
  of the OECD: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The effects of climate change on water resources, due to the arid and semi-arid
    nature of much of the country</li>
  <li>Potential changes in rainfall variability associated with the ENSO phenomenon,
    tropical cyclones, and the increased water-holding capacity of warmer air</li>
  <li>The fact that much of Australia lies in the tropics and subtropics, where
    many crops grow near or above their optimum temperatures</li>
  <li>The important role of fire in Australian ecosystems</li>
  <li>The lack of substantial cooler alpine or higher-latitude zones to which
    heat-intolerant Australian species, crops, or activities could retreat</li>
  <li>The fragmented nature of many of the remaining Australian native ecosystems</li>
  <li>The large role of commodity exports in the Australian economy, which makes
    Australia extremely vulnerable to changes in world trade and commodity prices-which
    in turn may be affected by climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, New Zealand is a mid-latitude country with relatively large
  alpine areas and greater water resources. Despite New Zealand's large dependence
  on export commodities-which may be affected by world commodity prices-general
  warming would allow adaptation through the introduction of more heat-tolerant
  crops or the migration of species and activities to higher elevations or latitudes.
  Increased agricultural production appears likely. One of the most obvious impacts
  of warming in New Zealand would be the retreat of snowfields and glaciers, which
  may have impacts on tourism, water resources, and hydroelectric power generation.
</p>
<p>For both countries, it is clear that studies of potential impacts are still
  very preliminary, with little work to date based on the latest scenarios from
  the coupled-ocean GCMs. Further, there has been relatively little integration
  across sectors, few attempts to take account of other components of global change,
  and few systematic studies of potential adaptations. </p>
<p>Despite these serious shortcomings, preliminary indications are that in both
  countries many activities and ecosystems are quite sensitive to climate change,
  with positive and negative effects. Australia's relatively low latitude makes
  it particularly vulnerable through impacts on its scarce water resources and
  on crops presently growing near or above their optimum temperatures. The effects
  may be quite nonlinear, with small warmings having benign effects but larger
  warmings producing more negative impacts. </p>
<p>High priority must be given in the future to studies that take a more integrated
  approach and facilitate assessment of the impacts of a wide range of climatic,
  socioeconomic, and other scenarios, as well as potential adaptations. Until
  then, any quantitative estimates of the potential cost of climate change must
  be regarded as highly uncertain. </p>
