<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>If the direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> are minimal and the future scenarios are relatively
  warm, decreases in LAI could occur over very large forested areas, ranging up
  to nearly 2/3 or more of the areas of boreal, temperate and tropical forests
  (<a href="318.htm#tableC-2">Table C-2</a>). By contrast, if the direct effects
  of CO<sub>2</sub> are strong and scenarios are not too warm, then all forest vegetation
  zones could experience increased biomass over as much as 2/3 or more of their
  areas (<a href="318.htm#tableC-3">Table C-3</a>). More likely, the responses
  will be intermediate with large regional contrasts, decreases in vegetation
  density in some areas, increases in others. Even though these are equilibrium
  simulations, a simulated decline in LAI generally implies a less favorable water
  balance and a loss of vegetation density. These losses imply a process of loss
  over some time period. We can only draw inferences about how rapidly such losses
  would occur, based on the simulated amount of loss. The regions that could experience
  declining LAI (<a href="321.htm#figureC-6">Figure C-6</a>, <a href="321.htm#figureC-7">Figure
  C-7</a>, <a href="321.htm#figureC-8">Figure C-8</a> and <a href="321.htm#figureC-9">Figure
  C-9</a>), would exhibit spatial gradients in response from mild decline grading
  into potentially catastrophic dieback. All reaches along the decline gradients
  would experience drought stress, which could trigger other responses, such as
  pest infestations and fire. Following disturbance by drought, infestation or
  pests, new vegetation, either of the same or of a different type would grow,
  but to a lower density. </p>
<p>Including both equilibrium and 'transient' scenarios, MAPSSwas run under four
  different scenarios (not counting the sulfate scenario, HADSUL). These range
  in global temperature increase (delta T) at the time of 2 x CO<sub>2</sub> from 1.7 (HADGHG)
  to 5.2ï¿½C (UKMO) (Annex B). In general, the areas of forest decline within individual
  biomes (incorporating a direct CO<sub>2</sub> effect) increase linearly with increasing
  delta T in the temperate and boreal forests; while, the areas of increased forest
  density decrease with increasing delta T. Tropical forests exhibit a similar
  pattern across the three FAR scenarios, but under the cooler HADGHG scenario
  show a large decline as simulated by MAPSS. By contrast, BIOME3, under the HADGHG
  scenario, shows almost no change in tropical forest density. Interestingly,
  adjacent tropical savannas increase in density in both ecological models under
  the HADGHG scenario. </p>
<h4>C.6.4. Equilibrium vs. "Transient" Scenarios and the Importance of Elevated
  CO<sub>2</sub><a name="c64"></a></h4>
<p>The newer climate scenarios (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 6), extracted from transient
  GCM simulations, are as a group quite different from the older, equilibrium
  scenarios (IPCC 1990, WG I, Section 3), in terms of the simulated ecological
  responses that these scenarios produce. All of the older scenarios produce large
  regions showing LAI declines (especially in temperate to high latitudes), as
  well as gains, even when the direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> are included (MAPSS simulations,
  <a href="321.htm#figureC-6">Figure C-6</a>, OSU and UKMO scenarios not shown).
  By contrast, under the newer scenarios, if a direct CO<sub>2</sub> effect is assumed, then
  there are very few regions with declines in LAI, as simulated by both MAPSS
  and BIOME3 (<a href="321.htm#figureC-7">Figures C-7</a>, <a href="321.htm#figureC-8">C-8</a>);
  rather, most of the world is simulated with an increased LAI. Actual increases
  in LAI could be limited by nitrogen availability in some areas, although elevated
  soil temperatures could increase decomposition, releasing more nitrogen (McGuire
  et al., 1995; VEMAP Members, 1995). The first-order differences between the
  older and newer scenarios are likely due to the smaller global temperature increases
  in the newer climate scenarios, which came from GCMs that had not attained their
  full equilibrium temperature changes. </p>
<h4>C.6.5. Sulfate Aerosols <a name="c65"></a></h4>
<p>The incorporation of sulfate aerosols produced a cooling effect in the HADCM2SUL
  run compared to the HADCM2GHG run, which lacked the sulfate forcing (GHG runs
  are not shown). The vegetation response to the sulfate forcing is observable
  in the model output from both MAPSS and BIOME3, but is relatively small compared
  to the differences between the newer and older climate scenarios. The newer
  scenarios produce widespread enhanced vegetation growth, even without the sulfate
  effect, if direct CO<sub>2</sub> effects are included and widespread decline if the CO<sub>2</sub>
  effects are excluded. The presence of the sulfate-induced cooling produces a
  much smaller amplitude effect on the vegetation than does the presence or absence
  of the direct effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on water-use-efficiency. </p>
<h4>C.6.6. Change in Annual Runoff<a name="c66"></a> </h4>
<p>Changes in annual runoff (<a href="#figureC-10">Figure C-10</a>) were mapped
  for all scenarios from both MAPSS and BIOME3. The changes in runoff are more
  stable among the different climate scenarios than are the simulated changes
  in LAI. The relative stability of simulated runoff change may reflect that runoff
  is a passive drainage process; whereas, evapotranspiration is a biological process
  and a function of the product of LAI and stomatal conductance. If stomatal conductance
  is reduced, e.g., via a direct CO<sub>2</sub> effect, LAI will compensate by increasing
  and runoff will show little change (Neilson and Marks, 1994). Some of the obvious
  differences between MAPSS and BIOME3 can be attributed to structural differences
  in the models. BIOME3 calculates water balance daily, even though all inputs
  are monthly; whereas, MAPSS calculates water balance monthly. This difference
  alone could be causing the more extreme responsiveness of MAPSS, which shows
  both larger runoff increases and larger losses in different regions. On the
  other hand, MAPSS uses a 3-layer soil with roots only in the top two layers;
  while BIOME3 uses a 2-layer soil with roots in both layers. The third layer
  in MAPSS provides a consistent base flow and might explain why MAPSS produces
  runoff in some drier regions, such as the western U.S., while BIOME3 does not.
  The hydrology models in both MAPSS and BIOME3, although process-based, are considered
  prototypes for eventual replacement by more elaborate models (see for example,
  the PILPS model intercomparison study; Love and Henderson-Sellers, 1994). <br>

<p>In general, MAPSS and BIOME3 produce similar regional patterns in the estimated
  changes in runoff. Although the magnitude of the changes are different, there
  are broad similarities in the sign of the change (but, clearly not in all regions).
  The largest area of regional difference between the two models is in interior
  Eurasia (<a href="#figureC-10">Figure C-10</a>). </p>
<p>Runoff generally increases in the Tundra, due to higher temperatures, more
  precipitation and more melting (<a href="318.htm#tableC-4">Tables C-4</a>, <a href="318.htm#tableC-5">C-5</a>).
  It decreases in the Taiga/Tundra due to encroachment of high-density boreal
  forest into low density vegetation (hence, higher transpiration). Runoff results
  are varied in the temperate forests, but Temperate Mixed forests tend to present
  a higher likelihood of reduced runoff over large areas (range 51% to 88% of
  the area under all scenarios) than of increased runoff (range 11% to 47% of
  the area under all scenarios, <a href="318.htm#tableC-4">Tables C-4</a>, <a href="318.htm#tableC-5">C-5</a>).
  Even the most benign scenarios indicate a minimum of 51% of the area of the
  world's temperate evergreen forests could experience a runoff decline; whereas,
  a maximum of 47% of the area would experience increased runoff. Temperate Evergreen
  Forests exhibit a greater likelihood of increased runoff over large areas (range
  29% to 87% of the area under all scenarios) than decreased runoff (range 11%
  to 68%), but the overlap in these increase and decrease ranges indicates the
  degree of uncertainty in the simulations. However, much of the increased runoff
  in the Temperate Evergreen forested areas is due to increased winter runoff,
  which is not necessarily available for use by ecosystems, irrigation or domestic
  purposes. Runoff from tropical forest areas could either increase or decrease
  over large areas, depending largely on the importance of the direct CO<sub>2</sub> effects.
  Runoff from drier vegetation types is regionally variable and exhibits both
  increases and decreases, depending on the direct CO<sub>2</sub> effects and regional rainfall
  patterns. </p>
