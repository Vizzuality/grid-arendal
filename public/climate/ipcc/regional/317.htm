<h1>C.4. Vegetation Classification </h1>
<p>The vegetation classification from each model has been aggregated to ten broad
  classes for MAPSS and nine for BIOME3. The models are most accurate in differentiating
  the broad physiognomic divisions of Forest, Savanna, semi-arid lands (Shrublands
  and Grasslands) and Arid Lands. These differences are largely based on the relationship
  between leaf area and site water balance and the simulated changes in leaf area
  and site water balance should be generally reliable (especially with respect
  to the sign of the change). The aggregated vegetation classes used for this
  analysis are as follows. </p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Tundra</i> is defined as the treeless vegetation which extends beyond
    treeline at high latitudes and altitudes, regardless of whether it is dominated
    by dwarf shrubs or herbaceous plants.</li>
  <li><i>Taiga/Tundra</i> is the broad 'ecotonal' region of open woodland, which
    occurs at higher latitudes or elevations beyond the 'closed' Boreal forest.
    This type is not explicitly simulated by BIOME3, but rather is included in
    Boreal Conifer Forest.</li>
  <li><i>Boreal Conifer Forest</i> is the Taiga proper, i.e., relatively dense
    forest composed mainly of needle-leaved trees and occurring in cold-winter
    climates.</li>
  <li><i>Temperate Evergreen Forest</i> encompasses the wet temperate and subtropical
    conifer forests of the NorthWest in North America, as well as subtropical
    evergreen broadleaf forests (e.g., in China) and the Nothofagus and Eucalyptus
    forests of the Southern Hemisphere.</li>
  <li><i>Temperate Mixed Forest</i> includes pure temperate broadleaf forests,
    such as oak-hickory, or beech-maple. It also includes mixtures of broadleaf
    and temperate evergreen types, such as the cool-mixed pine/fir and hardwood
    forests of the northeastern United States or the warm-mixed pine/hardwood
    forests of the southeastern U.S.</li>
  <li><i>Tropical Broadleaf Forest</i> includes both tropical evergreen forest
    and dense tropical drought-deciduous forests.</li>
  <li><i>Savanna/Woodlands</i> encompass all 'open' tree vegetation from high
    to low latitudes and elevations. The tropical dry savannas and drought deciduous
    forests are contained within this class. So too are the temperate pine savannas
    and 'pygmy' forests and the aspen woodlands adjacent to the boreal forest.
    Fire can play an important role in maintaining the open nature of these woodlands;
    while, grazing can increase the density of woody vegetation at the expense
    of grass. </li>
  <li><i>Shrub/Woodlands</i> are distinguished from the Savanna/Woodlands by their
    lower biomass and shorter stature. This is a drier vegetation type than the
    Savanna/Woodlands and encompasses most semi-arid vegetation types from Chaparral
    to mesquite woodlands to cold, semi-desert sage shrublands. The actual vegetation
    associated with this type is very susceptible to variation depending on soils,
    topography, fire, grazing and land-use history. Distinctions between shrub-steppe
    and grassland are sometimes difficult to quantify, given that each usually
    contains elements of both grass and woody vegetation. The relative abundance
    of the two functional types is considered in determining the classification,
    but there are no generally accepted rules to indicate how much woody vegetation
    is sufficient to label a region a shrubland, or conversely how much grass
    is required to label it a grassland.</li>
  <li><i>Grasslands</i> include both C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> grassland types in both temperate
    and tropical regions. Much of the grassland type is a 'fire climax' type that
    would be populated by shrubs either with the absence of fire, or with extensive
    grazing. </li>
  <li><i>Arid Lands</i> encompass all regions drier than grasslands, from hyper-arid
    to semi-arid, ranging from the "waterless" deserts such as the Namib to the
    'semi-deserts' of central Asia and Patagonia. The regions could be more or
    less 'grassy' or 'shrubby' depending on disturbance and land-use history.</li>
