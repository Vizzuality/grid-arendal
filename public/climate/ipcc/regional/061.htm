<h1>4.1. Background Characterization of Region </h1>
<p><i>Summary: This region is defined here as Australia, New Zealand, and their
  outlying islands. Australia is a large, flat continent spanning the tropics
  to mid-latitudes, with relatively nutrient-poor soils and a very arid interior,
  whereas New Zealand is much smaller, mountainous, and well watered. Both have
  "Gondwanan" ecosystems and unique flora and fauna. They have been subject to
  significant human influences-particularly from fire, agriculture, deforestation,
  and introduced exotic plants and animals. The total land area is 8 million square
  kilometers, and the population is 22 million. In contrast to other OECD countries,
  commodity-based industries of agriculture and mining dominate the economies
  and exports. Tourism is a major and rapidly growing industry.</i> </p>
<p>Australia is a large, ancient, eroded, and relatively flat continent, similar
  in size to Europe or the continental United States, with generally nutrient-poor
  soils. Situated between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, it is bordered to the
  north at 11°S by tropical waters and to the south at 44°S by the cold and windy
  Southern Ocean (<a href="#figure4-1">Figure 4-1</a>). It is the only major OECD
  country that lies largely in tropical and subtropical latitudes. In contrast,
  New Zealand is much smaller; it comprises two narrow, geologically young, and
  mountainous main islands located wholly in the mid-latitudes, from 35°S to 48°S.
  The total land area of the two countries is 8 million km<sup>2</sup>. Small offshore islands
  greatly extend both countries' jurisdictions. Key geographical features of the
  region are its relative isolation in an oceanic hemisphere, Gondwanan ecosystems
  and unique flora and fauna, low human population densities, and significant
  climatic features such as the ENSO phenomenon, the very arid interior of Australia,
  and tropical cyclones. <br>

<p><br>
  The ecosystems of the region are extremely varied, owing to the range of climates
  arising from the large latitudinal range, the continentality of Australia, and
  the mountainous, maritime nature of New Zealand. Australia has mainly rainfall-limited
  ecosystems (both natural and agricultural), although high temperatures also
  are limiting to crop production in some more northern areas. New Zealand has
  generally ample rainfall and mainly low-temperature limited ecosystems. More
  important biomes include the interior Australian deserts; semi-arid shrublands
  and savannas; tropical and temperate grasslands; tropical and temperate rainforests;
  sclerophyll forests and woodlands; alpine zones in southeast Australia and New
  Zealand; freshwater and coastal wetlands; tropical and subantarctic islands;
  coral reefs; and deep ocean systems. Land-use is reported as being 6% cropland
  (with a large fraction irrigated), 55% permanent pasture (much of it semi-arid
  rangelands), 19% forest and woodland, and 20% other (see WRI, 1996, Table 9.1;
  see also <a href="325.htm">Annex D</a> of this report). </p>
<p>Many parts of the region have been subject to significant human influences,
  particularly from the use of fire, widespread agriculture, vegetation clearance,
  deforestation, and other land-use change and from the introduction of exotic
  plants and animals-particularly rabbits and foxes in Australia and rabbits,
  deer, and Australian possums in New Zealand. Owing to millions of years of isolation,
  the region has a very high proportion of endemic species (plants and animals
  found only in this region), and its ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to introduced
  pests, diseases, and weeds. Environmental pollution is relatively low, in line
  with the low human population. Local air and water pollution from urban industries,
  land transport, and intensive farming and related processes are of concern in
  some areas, and soil erosion, rising water tables, and dryland salinization
  (as a result of land clearing and irrigation) are a concern in Australia (SOEC,
  1996). </p>
<p>The region's present population is about 18.5 million (Australia) and 3.5 million
  (New Zealand). Population growth of about 1.6% per annum is higher than the
  average for OECD countries, largely due to immigration. About 85% of the population
  live in urban and suburban areas, mostly near the coast. Half of Australia's
  population lives in just four coastal cities. Average population density is
  low; even when arid areas are excluded, it is only about 5 persons/km<sup>2</sup> for Australia
  (see <a href="325.htm">Annex D</a>). Both countries have strong relationships
  with Pacific island countries, in some cases extending to specific constitutional
  responsibilities, and they are home to sizable populations of Pacific Islanders.
  Large populations outside the region are dependent on the region's agricultural
  exports. </p>
<p>The two countries have open market economies, are members of the OECD, and
  in general have good access to the capital, technological, and human resources
  needed to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Per capita GDP is currently
  about US$19,000 in Australia and US$14,000 in New Zealand (the lower values
  in <a href="325.htm">Annex D</a> are calculated on a different, comparative
  purchasing power basis). Real annual growth rates have been about 3%, and inflation
  is low. Unemployment is about 8-10%. </p>
<p>Primary industries are a cornerstone of the region's economy. These industries
  include Australia's low-input pastoralism (grain, meat, and wool) and irrigated
  agriculture and horticulture and New Zealand's meat, wool, dairy, and horticulture
  industries, together with the associated processing industries in both countries.
  Forestry, fishing, and tropical crops also are important. Australia is a major
  exporter of coal, as well as energy-intensive iron, steel, and aluminium. Coal
  reserves are about 100 billion tonnes, with annual production of about 200 million
  tonnes, mostly for export. About two-thirds of New Zealand's electricity is
  hydro-generated. The bulk of the region's exports is raw or processed agricultural
  and mining products; in this respect the regional economies are anomalous among
  OECD countries, being more like the less developed and emerging economies (Crocombe
  et al., 1991). Thus, regional exports are heavily exposed to fluctuations in
  world commodity prices and trading conditions. </p>
<p>Tourism in the region-which is largely dependent on landscape, biodiversity,
  and climate-is growing faster than the global average and now contributes about
  13% of all export earnings, exceeding traditional export earners such as wool
  and wheat. </p>
<p>Socioeconomic trends in the region are similar to those in other developed
  countries. The population is aging, and there is a continuing shift of employment
  and population from lower value, commodity-related activities to higher value
  manufacturing and service activities. There is more intensive use of the less
  arid and more nutrient-rich land, especially for horticulture; in New Zealand
  especially there is rapid development of plantation forestry. </p>
