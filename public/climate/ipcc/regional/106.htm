<p><i>Climatic risks</i> </p>
<p>Climatic risks will be highly dependent on the expected pattern of time variability
  for weather variables. Increasing temperatures will promote the development
  rate of all winter crops, which therefore will face extreme events (cold spells)
  at a later stage (i.e., when they are more sensitive). Consequences depend as
  a whole on the probabilities of such extreme events and a higher intra-annual
  variability of minimum temperatures-yielding a higher probability of crop failure
  from frost damage. The same problem arises with winter cereals, which face extreme
  temperature maxima in early summer during the grain-filling period. Recent investigations
  show that the probabilities of extreme temperatures increase under all climate
  scenarios (CLAIRE, 1996) and that thermal shocks on poorly adapted genotypes
  lead to losses in grain yield and quality. <br>

  Higher temperatures in summer should not be a real challenge to summer crops
  (except spring cereals, if subjected to elevated temperatures during the grain-filling
  period) because they are more resilient than winter crops. Drought could be
  a major concern in the future, however, particularly in the Mediterranean zone
  and in central Europe. This is a genuinely complex problem; GCM-based scenarios
  do not agree on the magnitude of changes in space of at least one component
  of the water budget (precipitation), and changes in another component-potential
  evapotranspiration (PET)-are extremely dependent on calculation methods. Le
  Hou�rou (1995) states that a 1�C increase in air temperature will induce 37
  mm more PET south of 40�N (ECRASE, 1996)-an enormous 60% increase in PET in
  southern European countries. If simulated changes of -10% to -20% in summer
  precipitation for western, southern, and central Europe are reliable, fully
  irrigated crops may become even larger competitors to domestic and industrial
  users for water resources stored in aquifers and rivers (a 20% reduction represents
  a significant loss in currently moist areas). </p>
<p><i>Adaptive responses </i></p>
<p>Adaptive responses could be facilitated by increased knowledge of weather patterns
  and climate-related variability through the use of climate forecast information.
</p>
<p>To abate the shortening effect of temperatures on crop cycles, changed sowing
  dates and later-maturing genotypes could be used whatever the type of crop.
  This approach, however, may cause a problem with winter cereals whose cycle
  length often is linked with cold temperature requirements (vernalization) that
  may be not completely fulfilled during warmer winters. Later-maturing crops
  also should face climatic risks in the early summer. On the other hand, the
  sowing dates of winter crops cannot be postponed to early fall because of the
  much higher probability of experiencing low temperatures at a sensitive stage
  and because of the cost of fungal disease control during periods in the early
  fall. </p>
<p>For summer crops, using earlier sowing dates or longer-maturing varieties would
  counteract the detrimental effects of climate change in all cases-as was demonstrated
  for sunflowers throughout Europe in CLAIRE (1996), for spring wheat in Finland
  in Saarikko and Carter (1996), and for maize in Spain in CLAIRE (1996). Choosing
  adequate sowing dates also could help to synchronize full canopy development
  and maximum radiation availability on maize-type crops in northern European
  regions (Del�colle et al., 1996), which would enhance final production. Similarly,
  earlier sowing dates would allow the crop to develop during periods of lower
  PET demand, implying an improvement in global water-use efficiency and a reduction
  in irrigation demand-as simulated in Spain by CLAIRE (1996). </p>
