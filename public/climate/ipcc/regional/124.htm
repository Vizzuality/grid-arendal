<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Approximately 35% of the world's continental water (freshwater) is found in
  Latin America. However, its distribution within and among countries is highly
  variable. Freshwater systems (i.e., rivers, lakes, reservoirs, nontidal wetlands)
  and their ecosystems are potentially very sensitive to climate change and vulnerable
  to short-term fluctuations in climate, such as those associated with the ENSO
  phenomenon. </p>
<p>In the humid tropics, extreme precipitation events would increase the number
  of reservoirs silting up well before their design lives have been reached. Other
  areas affected by the impact of climate change on water resources could be those
  that rely on freshwater ecosystems (i.e., lakes and inland wetlands and their
  biota), including commercial and subsistence fisheries. Climate change will
  interact strongly with anthropogenic changes in land use, waste disposal, and
  water extraction; regional water resources will become increasingly stressed
  by higher demands to meet the needs of growing populations and economies, as
  well as by temperature increases. Conflicts may arise among users and regions-and
  even among Latin American countries that share common river basins. The effects
  of climate change on agricultural demands for water, particularly for irrigation,
  will depend significantly on changes in agricultural potential, prices of agricultural
  produce, and water costs. </p>
<p>The vulnerability of Latin American countries to climate change strongly depends
  on the impacts of climate change on water availability, as shown by studies
  performed under the auspices of the U.S. Country Studies Program (USCSP) and
  the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Changes in precipitation rates have consequences
  for hydropower production in Costa Rica, Panama, and western Argentina. ENSO
  events during recent decades have led to a significant reduction in runoff and
  consequently to higher dependence on thermal energy production, especially in
  areas with few energy alternatives. Alterations in hydrological balance resulting
  from climate change could reduce already impaired water supply and distribution
  systems in major Latin American cities and rural areas. According to vulnerability
  studies carried out in Mexico and Peru, the combined impacts of global warming
  and population growth could result in major reductions in water availability
  in both countries in coming decades. Monitoring of the hydrological cycle, sensitivity
  studies, development planning, and improved water management practices are key
  elements in preparing for projected water shortages. </p>
<p>Studies of vulnerability to sea-level rise have suggested that countries of
  the Central American isthmus as well as Venezuela and Uruguay could suffer adverse
  impacts leading to losses of coastal land and biodiversity, saltwater intrusion,
  and infrastructure damage. Impacts likely would be multiple and complex, with
  major economic implications. </p>
<p>Agricultural lands (excluding pastures) represent approximately 19% of the
  land area of Latin America. Over the past 40 years, the contribution of agriculture
  to the gross domestic product (GDP) of Latin American countries has been on
  the order of 10%. Agriculture remains a key sector in the regional economy,
  however, because it occupies an important segment (30-40%) of the economically
  active population. It also is very important for the food security of the poorest
  sectors of the population. Studies in Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay
  based on GCMs and crop models project decreased yields of a number of crops
  (e.g., barley, grapes, maize, potatoes, soybeans, wheat)-even when the direct
  effects of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fertilization and the implementation of moderate
  adaptation measures at the farm level are considered. Global warming also could
  enhance the negative impacts of animal and plant diseases and pests, with further
  negative effects on production. </p>
<p>Large alterations in Latin American ecosystems resulting from climate change
  impacts would have the potential to endanger the livelihoods of subsistence
  farmers and pastoral peoples, who make up a large portion of the rural populations
  of the Andean plateaus and tropical and subtropical forest areas. </p>
<p>Projected changes in climate could increase the impacts of already serious
  chronic malnutrition and diseases affecting a large sector of the Latin American
  population. The geographical distribution of vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria,
  dengue, Chagas') and infectious diseases (e.g., cholera) would expand southward
  and to higher elevations if temperature and precipitation increase. Increasing
  pollution and high concentrations of ground-level ozone, aggravated by increasing
  surface temperatures and higher solar radiation rates, could negatively affect
  human health and welfare, especially in urban areas. </p>
<p>Although climate change may bring benefits for certain regions in Latin America,
  increasing environmental deterioration resulting from the misuse of land might
  be aggravated by the impacts of climate change on water availability and agricultural
  lands, as a result of coastal inundation stemming from sea-level rise and riverine
  and flatland flooding. Socioeconomic and health problems could be exacerbated
  in critical areas, fostering massive migrations of rural and coastal populations
  and deepening national and international conflicts. </p>
<p>Additional efforts in monitoring, research, and sensitivity analyses are needed
  to allow decision makers and other stakeholders to understand the potential
  consequences of climate change and variability, take advantage of potential
  benefits, minimize negative impacts, and seek adequate adaptation options. Specific
  priorities include organization and/or updating of biogeophysical observation
  networks and monitoring systems, development of regional circulation models,
  performance of sensitivity analyses of key sectors-from ecosystems to infrastructure-that
  appear to be most vulnerable in each country or subregion, and development of
  suitable adaptation options. These efforts include the creation of new technologies
  and the adaptation of existing technologies generated within or outside the
  region. Promising options include horizontal cooperation initiatives among countries
  of this region and assistance from countries of other regions of the world-particularly
  Canada and the United States-as well as countries of the temperate Southern
  Hemisphere that already are integrated into the Valdivia Group. </p>
