<h4>6.3.1.4. Mountain Ecosystems and Cryosphere </h4>
<p>Latin America's mountain chains strongly influence its climate, hydrological
  cycles, and biodiversity. They are source regions for massive rivers (e.g.,
  the tributaries of the Amazonas and Orinoco basins) and represent major foci
  of biological diversification and endemism (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 5.1.4).
  Mountain areas are exposed to extreme weather and climate events, such as unusually
  high or low temperatures or precipitation. The Agroclimatological Study of the
  Andean Zone (Frére et al., 1978) provides detailed information on the particular
  limitations that climate imposes on development in the high South American plateaus
  and associated mountain ranges in the central Andes (Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia).
</p>
<p>Although the present importance of mountain ecosystems in the national market
  economies varies from country to country, Andean and extra-Andean mountain ranges
  have sustained traditional subsistence agriculture for centuries to millennia.
  Athough the human population density is very low in the northern and southern
  Andes, the central Andes support the largest percentage rural population in
  the region. </p>
<p>The cryosphere in the Latin American region is represented by glaciers in the
  Andes; Patagonia's ice fields (between 47°S and 52°S); and the Darwin ice field
  in Tierra del Fuego, at about 54ºS. Seasonal snowfall on the high Andes is critical
  for the subsistence of communities in central Chile and large piedmont communities
  in Argentina, where water supply depends almost entirely on snowmelt. </p>
<p>At present, GCMs do not provide sufficiently accurate regional projections;
  therefore, scenarios of climate change for Latin American mountain areas are
  highly uncertain. An added drawback is the scarcity of continuous and reliable
  meteorological and hydrological records in most areas. If climate changes as
  projected in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios (Greco
  et al., 1994), the length of time that snowpacks remain will be reduced, altering
  the timing and amplitude of runoff from snow/ice and increasing evaporation-hence
  altering ecosystems at lower elevations and affecting human communities that
  depend on this runoff. If extreme events increase in frequency or intensity,
  landslides, flash flooding, and fires would become more likely, and soil instability
  would increase. Even in subhumid mountain environments, fires in the dry season
  followed by heavy rainfall events-before substantial vegetation recovery has
  taken place-usually lead to almost irreversible landscape modification (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 5.1.3). </p>
<p>Warming in high-mountain regions would lead to the reduction or disappearance
  of significant snow and ice surfaces (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 7.4.1 and 7.4.2).
  Furthermore, changes in atmospheric circulation stemming from global warming
  may modify snowfall rates, with a direct effect on the seasonal renewal of water
  supply and the variability of runoff and underground water supplies in piedmont
  areas (Del Carril et al., 1996). Glaciers are melting at accelerated rates in
  the Venezuelan and Peruvian Andes (Schubert, 1992; Hastenrath and Ames, 1995),
  as well as at the southern extreme of the subcontinent (Aniya et al., 1992;
  Kadota et al., 1992; Malagnino and Strelin, 1992). Nevertheless, larger glaciers,
  such as those in the Patagonian Andes, should continue to exist into the 22nd
  century. More water would be released from regions with extensive glaciers;
  as a result, some arid regions in their vicinity would benefit from additional
  runoff. Based on seasonal patterns and extreme events in these regions, however,
  this runoff could trigger major erosion, flooding, and sedimentation problems
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.2.2). Melting of Andean glaciers and ice fields
  in southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego would increase runoff, as well as
  the water levels of neighboring rivers and lakes on both sides of the Andes.
</p>
<p>Expected impacts of climate change on the biological diversity of mountain
  ecosystems would include loss of the coolest climatic zones toward the peaks
  of the mountains and shifting of remaining vegetation belts upslope, resulting
  in a net decrease in biodiversity. Mountaintops may become more vulnerable to
  genetic and environmental pressure (Bortenschlager, 1993; IPCC 1996, WG II,
  Section 5.2.2). </p>
<p>Viable areas for crop production in mountainous regions would likely change
  as a result of climate change. Elevational shifts in vegetation and altered
  hydrological patterns may have major implications for the use and conservation
  of multiple vegetation belts by traditional Andean peoples. These shifts may
  lead to competition between alternative land uses (e.g., conservation of endangered
  species versus expansion of subsistence agriculture) toward the mountaintops.
  Given the wide range of microclimates in Latin America's mountain areas that
  have been exploited through the cultivation of diverse crops, direct negative
  effects of climate change on crop yields may not be extremely serious. However,
  continued adaptation to varied climates may be possible only if the remarkable
  diversity of local genotypes is conserved. Development planners and decision
  makers should be fully aware that the protection of the wide variety of wild
  and domesticated genotypes of major crops in the Andes also will be crucial
  for the production of new crop varieties in the face of changing climatic conditions
  in other areas of the world. In 1960, for example, the discovery of two varieties
  of tomato in Peru provided the industry with economic benefits estimated at
  US$5 million per year (LAC CDE, 1992). Decision makers also should be aware
  that, unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken, climate change could
  completely disrupt lifestyles in mountain villages by altering already marginal
  food production and the availability of water resources. </p>
<p>Shifts in crop and rangeland elevation belts may be dramatic in rural, densely
  populated areas of the central Andes; deep socioeconomic changes have been brought
  about by past climatic pulses (Cardich, 1974; Frére et al., 1978). Studies of
  the effects of climate change in Ecuador's central Sierra (Parry, 1978; Bravo
  et al., 1988) have shown that crop growth and yields are controlled by complex
  interactions among different climatic factors and that specific methods of cultivation
  may permit crop survival in sites where microclimates otherwise would be unsuitable.
  Such specific details cannot be included in GCM-based impact assessments-which
  have suggested positive impacts, such as decreasing frost risks in the Mexican
  highlands (Liverman and O'Brien, 1991), and negative impacts, such as decreases
  in the productivity of upland agriculture (Parry et al., 1990). </p>
<p>In many mountain regions, tourist resorts and large urban areas close to the
  mountains have spread into high-risk areas; these areas will be increasingly
  endangered by slope instability and flood risk, particularly as a consequence
  of extreme events aggravated by climate change. Such situations already have
  been observed in Andean cities (Bogota, La Paz, Mendoza, Quito); cities on the
  Serra do Mar mountain range (Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Santos) and their outskirts;
  and Guatemala City, in Central America. </p>
<p>Runoff changes resulting from snow/ice melting and from changes in winter snowfalls
  on high-altitude mountains would affect important sectors and activities (freshwater
  supply, agriculture, industry, and power generation) in the Andes piedmont areas
  (e.g., Cuyo region in Argentina, Elqui Valley in Chile). In view of the economic
  importance of these activities, adaptation measures are likely to be necessary
  (Fuenzalida et al., 1993; Del Carril et al., 1996; IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
  5.2.4). </p>
