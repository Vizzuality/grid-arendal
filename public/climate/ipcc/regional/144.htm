<h4>6.3.5.1. Direct Impacts of Climate Change </h4>
<p>The direct impacts of climate change depend mainly on exposure to heat or cold
  waves or extreme weather events. The former involves an alteration of heat-
  and cold-related illnesses and deaths. Although Latin America was not included
  in the five regions identified by IPCC (1990) for analysis of regional climate
  change simulation, Kattemberg et al. (IPCC 1996, WGI, Chapter 6) made generalized
  tentative assessments concerning extreme events. Studies in temperate and subtropical
  countries have shown increases in daily death rates associated with extreme
  outdoor temperatures. Mortality increases much more steeply with rising temperatures
  than with falling temperatures (Kalkstein, 1993). The lowest mortality occurs
  within a range of intermediate comfortable temperatures and humidities (between
  21°C and 26°C and below 60% relative humidity, in these countries). </p>
<p>No references to studies and research on direct health impacts from projected
  warming in Latin America are included in the SAR; however, extrapolation of
  investigations performed in cities in the United States, China, The Netherlands,
  and the Middle East indicates that morbidity and mortality also could increase
  in this region as a result of the expected increase in the number of days with
  high daily temperatures (i.e., the persistence of days with higher-than-normal
  maximum and minimum temperatures) (Haines et al., 1993; Kalkstein, 1993; IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 18.2.1). The impacts would be exacerbated by high humidity
  rates, intense solar radiation, and weak winds. All of these factors affect
  the physiological mechanisms of human adaptation. </p>
<p>High temperatures and air pollutants, especially particulates, act synergistically
  to influence human mortality. This effect is occurring in large cities, such
  as Mexico City and Santiago, Chile, where such conditions enhance the formation
  of secondary pollutants (e.g., ozone) (Escudero, 1990; Katsouyanni et al., 1993;
  Canziani, 1994). </p>
<p>Global warming could increase the number and severity of extreme weather events
  such as storms, floods, and droughts, and related landslides and wildfires.
  Such events tend to increase death and pathology rates-directly through injuries
  or indirectly through infectious diseases, as well as through social problems
  that stem from the dislocation of people, adverse psychological effects, and
  other stresses (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 18.2.2). A number of slums and shanty
  towns located on hills, as well as human settlements located in flood-prone
  areas, are subject to periodic natural disasters that adversely affect human
  health (<a href="146.htm">Section 6.3.6</a>). These overcrowded and poorly-serviced
  peri-urban settlements also provide a potential breeding ground for disease
  hosts (e.g., rats, mice, cockroaches, flies) and disease organisms, increasing
  the population's vulnerability. Communities surrounded by these poverty belts
  also become more vulnerable to periodic disease outbreaks (WHO Commission on
  Human Health and Environment, 1992). </p>
<p>Climate variability also may aggravate diseases resulting from water contamination.
  Increases in Salmonella infections following a flood in Bolivia resulted from
  the El Niño event of 1983 (Telleria, 1986). </p>
<h4>6.3.5.2. Indirect Impacts of Climate Change<a name="indirect"></a> </h4>
<p>Infectious and parasitic diseases are important causes of morbidity and mortality
  in Latin America, and the main cause of death in children (PAHO, 1994). Some
  infectious diseases are more common in tropical and subtropical areas than in
  temperate or cold areas. Therefore, global warming would tend to extend their
  area of influence or increase the importance of outbreaks. Some of these diseases
  are food- or water-related infections; after they are introduced into a region,
  they show a tendency to spread over the whole region. Viral, bacterial, and
  protozoan agents of diarrhea can survive in water-especially in warmer waters-for
  long periods of time and thus spread at increased rates in rainfall periods,
  enhancing their transmissibility among people. An example is cholera, which
  was introduced into Peru in 1993. It produced an outbreak that spread to most
  of the South American subcontinent, including places as far as Buenos Aires
  (PAHO, 1994). Cholera's relation to the ENSO phenomenon was proposed by Colwell
  (1996). This disease and other diarrheas and dysenteries are associated with
  the distribution and quality of surface water, as well as with flooding and
  water shortages. These conditions alter the population dynamics of organisms,
  impede personal hygiene, and impair local sewage systems. Increases in coastal
  algal blooming also may amplify the proliferation and transmission of Vibrio
  cholerae. </p>
<p>Algal blooming also may be associated with biotoxin contamination of fish and
  shellfish (Epstein et al., 1993). With ocean warming, temperature-sensitive
  toxins produced by phytoplankton could cause contamination of seafood more often,
  resulting in an increased frequency of poisoning. Thus, climate-induced changes
  in the production of aquatic pathogens and biotoxins may jeopardize seafood
  safety. </p>
<p>Other infectious diseases not included in the SAR have now achieved importance
  and could reach critical levels in South America. Some viruses have had unexpected
  outbreaks-such as arenaviruses in Argentina and Bolivia (PAHO, 1996) and hantaviruses
  in the south of Argentina; their relationship to climate change is not yet well
  understood. Fungi such as Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis-which require high humidity
  and generally are associated with rainfall regimes of 500-2,000 mm/yr and average
  temperatures of 14-30°C-are found in some areas of South America (e.g., Brazil,
  Venezuela, and northern Argentina) (Restrepo et al., 1972), where this mycosis
  is becoming endemic. It may spread if climate change provides adequate conditions
  to start the epidemiological chain. In this connection, increasing surface traffic
  that has resulted from commercial activity stemming from the new regional common
  market-Mercosur-may call for the development of appropriate sanitary barriers
  (e.g., disinfection of vehicles and their contents to block transport of harmful
  fungi) at borders. </p>
<p>A special category of infectious diseases-a group known as vector-borne diseases
  (VBDs)-already affect a large number of people in Latin America. These diseases
  could expand their geographic and elevational ranges because conditions would
  be more favorable for viruses and other living agents, reservoirs, and vectors
  as a result of global warming. The most important VBDs in Latin America are
  listed below, with indications of some of their main vectors: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Malaria: Vectors are several species of the mosquito genus Anopheles. Malaria's
    incidence is affected by temperature, surface water, and humidity (Carcavallo
    et al., 1995).</li>
  <li>Dengue: Vectors are Aedes and other mosquito species. Dengue is expanding
    in Latin America (Koopman et al., 1991; Herrera-Basto et al., 1992). High
    temperatures, particularly in winter (Halstead, 1990), promote the spread
    of this disease.</li>
  <li>Yellow fever: Several species are vectors. Yellow fever has an urban epidemiology
    similar to dengue, but it also has cycles that develop in the wild (Martinez
    et al., 1967).</li>
  <li>Chagas' disease or American trypanosomiasis: Vector is <i>Triatominae</i>
    bug of the order Hemiptera. About 100 million people in Latin America are
    at risk, and 18 million people are infected (Hack, 1955; Carcavallo and Martinez,
    1972; WHO, 1995).</li>
  <li>Schistosomiasis: The vector is the water snail (Grosse, 1993).</li>
  <li>Onchocersiasis or river blindness: Vectors are several species of <i>Simulildae</i>
    or "blackflies" (WHO, 1985).</li>
  <li>Leishmaniasis: Vectors are several species of <i>Phlebotominae</i> or "sandfly"
    (Bradley, 1993).</li>
  <li><i>Limphatic filariasis</i>: Vectors are several mosquito species (PAHO,
    1994).</li>
</ul>
<p>Other viruses also affect human beings in this region. One produces Venezuelan
  equine encephalitis; it is transmitted by several mosquito species, and cases
  have been reported in Colombia and Venezuela (WHO, 1996). Its relation to climate
  change has not yet been demonstrated; however, warming could affect the geographical
  distribution and dispersion, as well as some behaviors and patterns, of vertebrate
  reservoirs (mammals and birds) and vectors. </p>
<p>Infective agents and vectors are sensitive to environmental changes, especially
  those conditioned by temperatures and humidity. Vectors also are sensitive to
  wind, soil moisture, surface water, and changes in vegetation and forest distribution
  (Bradley, 1993). Temperatures and humidity influence the geographical and elevational
  dispersion of vectors (Burgos et al., 1994; Curto de Casas et al., 1994), as
  well as their population dynamics and behavior. Precipitation is an important
  factor for vectors with aquatic stages, such as mosquitoes and blackflies, because
  breeding places are increased and maintained by rainfall. Winds may contribute
  to the dispersion of some flying insects, such as mosquitoes, blackflies, and
  sandflies (Ando et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Several years ago, VBDs were very critical in many areas of the region; during
  recent years, however, some of them have been almost entirely controlled or
  reduced in their endemicity. Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical
  areas of the American continent, from south of Mexico to northern Argentina.
  Several species of mosquitoes of genus <i>Anopheles</i> are vectors of <i>Plasmodium
  vivax</i> and <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, which are causal agents of the disease
  that cannot survive at temperatures below 14-18°C, depending on the <i>Plasmodium
  species</i> (see <a href="#figure6-6">Figure 6-6</a>). The normal type of epidemiological
  curve of malaria in northeast Argentina has shown a peak in new cases every
  1-4 years, particularly during the months of March to May or June, when <i>Anopheles
  darlingi</i> has been present. During the period 1991-93, however, there were
  cases every month of the year, and <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> were captured or
  reported sighted during the whole period. Thus, more studies are needed to assess
  the influence of new dams on the behavior of vector species and the epidemiology
  of the disease, as well as the influence of increases in minimum temperatures
  (Carcavallo et al., 1995). Martens et al. (1995) have predicted that temperature
  increases of several degrees Celsius at higher elevations-which could occur
  in Andean ranges under projected climate change-may produce seasonal epidemic
  transmission in areas currently free of paludism. <br>
