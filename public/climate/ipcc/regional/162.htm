<h4>7.3.3. Water Resources </h4>
<ul>
  <li> <i>In an area dominated by arid and semi-arid lands, water is a very limited
    resource. Droughts, desertification, and water shortages are permanent features
    of life in many countries in the region. Rapid development is threatening
    some water supplies through salinization and pollution, and increasing standards
    of living and expanding populations are increasing demand. Water is a scarce
    resource-and will continue to be so in the future. Projections of changes
    in runoff and water supply under climate change scenarios vary. Some countries
    are developing programs to conserve and reuse water or to achieve more efficient
    irrigation. Some countries are vulnerable to reductions in runoff; because
    they rely heavily on hydropower production, their energy supply is likely
    to be affected. </i></li>
</ul>
<p>In semi-arid and arid environments, rainfall is short-lived and often very
  intense. Because soils tend to be thin, much of the rainfall runs directly off
  of the surface, only to infiltrate deeper soils downslope or along river beds
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.2.1). Thus, water availability is a major concern
  in most countries of the region (Middle East Water Commission, 1995; UNEP, 1997).
  Some countries (e.g., Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon) have reliable sources of
  surface water; the majority, however, depend either on groundwater or on desalinization
  for their water supply-both of which enable them to use water in amounts far
  exceeding the estimated renewable fresh water in the country (World Bank, 1995c;
  IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 4; GEO, 1997). Wetlands can retain water, especially
  during dry periods, and thus can enhance recharge to major aquifers (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Section 6.3.3.2.3). However, in semi-arid and arid areas, where groundwater
  recharge occurs after flood events, changes in the frequency and magnitude of
  rainfall events will alter the number of recharge events (IPCC 1996, WG II,
  Section 10.3.6). Water from glacial melt is an important contribution to the
  flow of some river systems, and changes in seasonality and amount from this
  source are likely to occur as a result of climate change (see <a href="160.htm">Section
  7.3.2.2</a>). Fossil aquifers are important water sources in many deserts; they
  will not be affected on a time scale relevant to humans (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter
  3). </p>
<p>As a result of rapid increases in the income of some countries-with resulting
  increases in living standards-the demand for water has increased, such that
  many countries in the Middle East will experience chronic water shortages (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 14.2.2; UNEP 1997). The list of nations with water supply
  problems is likely to expand as a consequence of the accelerated pace of urbanization.
  In some countries (e.g., Kuwait), monitoring programs for water quality have
  been established in an attempt to maintain water quality in accordance with
  World Health Organization (WHO) standards (UNEP, 1997). It is projected that
  the population without safe drinking water will almost double by 2030, assuming
  a "business-as-usual" scenario (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 14.2.2). </p>
<p>Many countries in the region have highly urbanized populations, for whom it
  is easier and more efficient to organize water supply, treatment, and delivery
  systems than it is for rural populations. Moreover, demand can be more easily
  managed to promote water-use efficiency in urban areas. In most countries in
  the region, a large proportion of the population has running water in their
  homes. Although municipal and industrial water use will grow, per capita domestic
  use is likely to decrease and the quality of drinking water to increase with
  centralized treatment. However, future urban water demands are likely to compete
  with the irrigated agricultural sector (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 14.2.2); 15
  of the countries in the region use more than 75% of their water for irrigation
  (see <a href="156.htm#table7-1">Table 7-1</a>). </p>
<p>There are other problems associated with some water bodies in the region, especially
  in areas of high human density. In these areas, habitat degradation often is
  important, causing many semi-enclosed water bodies to become eutrophic (Kharin,
  1995; IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 16.1.1). Dryland salinization also is having
  an impact on water quality in some countries where groundwater is contaminated
  with salt; in other countries (e.g., Oman and United Arab Emirates), seawater
  has intruded into freshwater aquifers (UNEP, 1997). </p>
<p>Efforts are being made in some countries to use wastewater (Sarikaya and Eroglu,
  1993; Abdelrahman and Alajmi, 1994; Shelef et al., 1994; Shelef and Azov, 1996)-and
  to use water more efficiently, especially for agriculture. The Middle East Water
  Commission (1995) suggests that, for some countries, a reduction of 30% in water
  use for agriculture would alleviate some water crises. Increased recycling of
  water is being explored in areas where there are shortages of water, either
  perennially (e.g., Israel and Oman) or during some seasons (e.g., Turkey in
  the summer, when shortages are exacerbated by tourist demand) (Middle East Water
  Commission, 1995; IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 14.2.2). In many of the countries
  of the FSU, plans are underway to increase the efficiency of irrigation practices,
  with savings of over 20% expected in some regions (see <a href="170.htm#trans">Section
  7.4.1</a>). </p>
<p>Populations in many countries of the region are vulnerable because they depend
  on water supplies from outside their political boundaries. Formal agreements
  are in place, or are being developed, to share the water resources of rivers
  flowing across political boundaries (e.g., Euphrates, Tigris, Jordan, and Indus);
  such agreements would reduce the potential for future conflicts over water (Blaikie
  et al., 1994; Middle East Water Commission, 1995). </p>
<p>River-basin runoff is very sensitive to small variations in climatic conditions
  and in the vegetation cover of its catchment. Riebsame et al. (1995) used two
  GCMs (GISS and GFDL) to assess the effect of climate change on various rivers
  throughout the world, including the Indus. The GCM climate scenarios projected
  an increase of 11-16% in annual runoff for the Indus. The authors also assessed
  the effect of a 2ï¿½C temperature increase with +20%, 0%, and -20% changes in
  precipitation and found that runoff is more sensitive to changes in precipitation
  than to changes in temperature. </p>
<p>The effect of climate change on runoff has been studied for some river basins
  in the region. Based on two GCM runs (CCC-J1 and GFDL-A3) with 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium
  climate scenarios, several mountain and plains watersheds experienced 30-35%
  reductions in runoff in years of water shortages and 20-25% reductions in years
  of excess water. A projection based on a third GCM run (GFDL-X2g transient model)
  confirms the tendency for a reduction in water resources during years of plentiful
  water supply for mountainous watersheds (Pilifosova et al., 1996). In the short
  term, however, some studies suggest increases in water resources. For example,
  the above simulation projects increases of up to 12% in the water resources
  of some watersheds in 2000 and 2030 (Golubtsov et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Some countries in the region produce large amounts of hydropower; Tajikistan,
  for example, is the third-highest producer in the world (World Bank, 1995b).
  Changes in runoff to the system could have a significant effect on the power
  output of these countries. One of the bigger river systems in the region, the
  Euphrates and Tigris, has a number of dams that are used for irrigation and
  water supply as well as for hydropower. To date, no studies have assessed the
  effect of climate change on these systems. However, if there is a reduction
  in total runoff as a result of climate change, the increased demand for agricultural
  and hydropower activities could place more pressure on water resources. </p>
