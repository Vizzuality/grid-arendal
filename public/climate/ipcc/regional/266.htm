<h4>10.1.2.2. Future Climate Projections </h4>
<p>Global climate models project that the mean annual surface temperature will
  rise by about 1.0-3.5°C by the year 2100. On regional scales, confidence in
  future climate projections remains low. There is more confidence in temperature
  projections than in precipitation changes. The degree to which regional climate
  variability will change also remains uncertain. Projections of future changes
  in temperature and rainfall for the Temperate Asia region, based on available
  scenarios from various GCM experiments, are described below. </p>
<h4>10.1.2.2.1. Temperature<a name="temp"></a> </h4>
<p>GCM equilibrium response experiments suggested an annual mean warming of 2-5°C
  over the region as a result of a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> (experiment acronyms A3, F1,
  G1, and H2 in <a href="003.htm#table1-1">Table 1-1</a> of the Introduction). Warming
  was projected to be more pronounced during winter than in summer. Subsequent
  numerical experiments with coupled AOGCMs, which included transient increases
  in greenhouse gases (i.e., increases in equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> at a rate of 1% per year),
  projected a slightly lower degree of warming over the region of between 2°C
  and 3°C at the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling on an annual mean basis (experiment acronyms
  X2, X5, and X7 in <a href="003.htm#table1-2">Table 1-2</a> of the Introduction). Warming
  was more pronounced in arid/semi-arid and Siberian regions than in the coastal
  monsoon region. Recent simulation experiments (experiment acronyms X6 and X8
  in <a href="003.htm#table1-2">Table 1-2</a> of the Introduction), wherein GCMs also
  include the offsetting effects of sulfate aerosols, project a temperature rise
  of about 0.8°C over the eastern part of the region, about 1°C over most parts
  of eastern China, and close to 2°C in the Siberian region on an annual mean
  basis by the middle of the next century. During winter, the projected changes
  are marginally higher for all of the regions; during summer, however, the projected
  warming is considerably less, and most parts of China show a cooling. It should
  be noted that the projections that account for sulfate aerosols also are highly
  uncertain because our current understanding of the indirect effects of sulfate
  aerosols is poor (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 6.2.2). </p>
<h4>10.1.2.2.2. Precipitation<a name="pre"></a> </h4>
<p>In equilibrium and transient-response numerical experiments with GCMs, precipitation
  is projected to increase marginally (<0.5 mm/day) at the time of doubling of
  CO<sub>2</sub> during the winter (DJF) throughout the region. In summer (JJA), the spatial
  pattern of projected changes in precipitation is not uniform over the region.
  Model projections suggest that precipitation will increase slightly (0.5-1.0
  mm/day) in the northern part of the region (Siberia) and by more than 1 mm/day
  over the Korean peninsula, the Japanese islands, and the southWestern part of
  China. In contrast, precipitation changes show a decline in the northern, western,
  and southern parts of China (IPCC WG I, Section 6.2.2). The projected decline
  in rainfall over most of China is substantial in numerical experiments that
  include the effects of sulfate aerosols. </p>
<h4>10.1.2.2.3. Possible changes in sea ice over the Sea of Okhotsk<a name="pos"></a></h4>
<p>Tokioka et al. (1995) studied possible changes in sea ice over the Sea of Okhotsk
  based on future climate projections using a coupled GCM (MRI-X3). Sea ice in
  the Sea of Okhtosk is most vulnerable to climate, and it influences climate,
  ecosystems, fisheries, and transportation around the area. Because this area
  is the southernmost ocean in the Northern Hemisphere where sea ice forms, a
  sea ice-albedo feedback may occur early and effectively. These results suggest
  an early disappearance of sea ice and thus a large sea-surface temperature (SST)
  rise over the Sea of Okhotsk. Therefore, it is plausible that this area will
  suffer large impacts of climate change in coming decades. </p>
