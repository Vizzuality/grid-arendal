<h1>B.5. Conclusions </h1>
<p>Analysis of surface air temperature and precipitation results from regional
  climate change experiments carried out with AOGCMs indicates that the biases
  in present-day simulations of regional climate change and the inter-model variability
  in the simulated regional changes are still too large to yield a high level
  of confidence in simulated change scenarios. The limited number of experiments
  available with statistical downscaling techniques and nested regional models
  has shown that complex topographical features, large lake systems, and narrow
  land masses not resolved at the resolution of current GCMs significantly affect
  the simulated regional and local change scenarios, both for precipitation and
  (to a lesser extent) temperature (IPCC 1996, WG I). This adds a further degree
  of uncertainty in the use of GCM-produced scenarios for impact assessments.
  In addition, most climate change experiments have not accounted for human-induced
  landscape changes and only recently has the effect of aerosols been investigated.
  Both these factors can further affect projections of regional climate change.
</p>
<p>Compared to the global-scale changes due to doubled CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, the
  changes at 10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup> scale derived from transient
  AOGCM runs are greater. Considering all models, at the 10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>6</sup>
  km<sup>2</sup> scale, temperature changes due to CO<sub>2</sub> doubling varied between
  0.6 and 7°C and precipitation changes varied between -35 and 50% of control
  run values, with a marked inter-regional variability. Thus, the inherent predictability
  of climate diminishes with reduction in geographical scale. The greatest model
  agreement in the simulated precipitation change scenarios was found over the
  South East Asia (about -1 to 30%), Northern Europe (about -9 to 16%), Central
  North America (about -7 to 5%), and East Asia (about 0.1 to 16%) regions in
  summer, and Southern Europe (about -2 to 29%), Northern Europe (about 5 to 25%),
  and East Asia (about 0.5 to 18%) in winter. For temperature, the greatest model
  agreement in simulated warming occurred over Australia in summer (about 1.65
  to 2.5°C, when excluding one outlier) and the Sahel in winter (about 1.8 to
  3.15°C, when excluding one outlier). Regardless of whether flux correction was
  used, the range of model sensitivities was less than the range of biases, which
  suggests that models produce regional sensitivities that are more similar to
  each other than their biases. </p>
<p>The latest regional model experiments indicate that high-resolution information,
  on the order of a few 10s of km or less, may be necessary to achieve high accuracy
  in regional and local change scenarios in areas of complex physiography. In
  the last few years, substantial progress has been achieved in the development
  of tools for enhancing GCM information. Statistical methods were extended from
  the monthly/seasonal to the daily time scale, and nested model experiments were
  extended to the multi-year time scale. Also, variable- and high-resolution global
  models can be used to study possible feedbacks of mesoscale forcings on general
  circulation. </p>
<p>Regional modeling techniques, however, rely critically on the GCM performance
  in simulating large-scale circulation patterns at the regional scale, because
  they are a primary input to both empirical and physically based regional models.
  Although the regional performance of coarse-resolution GCMs is still somewhat
  poor, there are indications that features such as positioning of storm track
  and jet stream core are better simulated as the model resolution increases.
  The latest nested GCM/RegCM and variable-resolution model experiments, which
  employed relatively high-resolution GCMs and were run for long simulation times
  (up to 10 years) show an improved level of accuracy. Therefore, as a new generation
  of higher resolution GCM simulations become available, it is expected that the
  quality of simulations with regional and local downscaling models will also
  rapidly improve. In addition, the movement towards coupling regional atmospheric
  models with appropriately scaled ecological, hydrological, and mesoscale ocean
  models will not only improve the simulation of climatic sensitivity, but also
  provide assessments of the joint response of the land surface, atmosphere, and/or
  coastal systems to altered forcings. </p>
