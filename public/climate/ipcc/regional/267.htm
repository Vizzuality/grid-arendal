<h1>10.2. Sensitivity, Adaptability, and Vulnerability </h1>
<h4>10.2.1. Ecological Systems (including Cryosphere)<a name="eco"></a> </h4>
<h4>10.2.1.1. Forests, Grasslands, and Tundra<a name="for"></a> </h4>
<p>Although the area of potential distribution of temperate forests in Temperate
  Asia is, to a large extent, cleared and used for intensive agriculture, global
  warming can be considered sufficient to trigger structural changes in remaining
  temperate forests. The nature and magnitude of these changes depend on associated
  changes in water availability, as well as in water-use efficiency. Shifts in
  temperature and precipitation in temperate rangelands may result in altered
  growing seasons and boundary shifts among grasslands, forests, and shrublands
  (IPCC 1996, WGII, Sections 1.5 and 2.6). </p>
<p>According to simulation results of potential vegetation change by Neilson (see
  <a href="315.htm">Annex C</a>), temperate mixed forest areas, temperate evergreen
  forest, and grassland areas would expand in Temperate Asia under 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium
  scenario conditions. However, there would be practically no change in the leaf
  area index (LAI) in almost all parts of the region (see <a href="320.htm#figureC-2">Figures
  C-2</a> and <a href="320.htm#figureC-4">C-4</a> of <a href="315.htm">Annex C</a>). Uncertainty
  remains about the time lag between climate change and migration of forest species
  at high latitudes. </p>
<p>For boreal forests, which are mainly concentrated in the Russian Federation,
  climate models (UKMO-H3, GFDL-A2) suggest large shifts in distribution (area
  reductions of up to 50%) and productivity (Dixon et al., 1996). All components
  of boreal forest ecosystems would be affected, including water resources, soil
  systems, and wildlife, and the combined effect could be even stronger as a result
  of interacting factors. </p>
<p>Grasslands and shrublands in boreal regions may expand significantly, whereas
  the tundra zone may decrease by up to 50%, according to model projections. Climatic
  warming also would increase the release of methane from deep peat deposits,
  particularly from tundra soils, because they would become wetter. It is expected
  that the release of CO<sub>2</sub> would increase, though not by more than 25% of its present
  level (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.4.2). </p>
<p>The most widely distributed coniferous forests in Siberia are the larch forests:
  West of the Yenissei River, <i>Larix</i> russica predominates; to the east,
  <i>Larix gmelini</i> prevails. The latter grows in the north of eastern Siberia,
  where the annual temperature range reaches about 100°C (-64°C to +38°C), as
  shown by mean long-term meteorological data from 1937 to the present from Yakutsk
  weather station. <i>Larix gmelini</i> has a specialized root system: Its apex
  central root dies off at the permafrost border, and a root system develops in
  the upper soil layers. The larch is vulnerable to damage by fires and insects,
  which may occur more frequently under global warming. Increased steppe area
  also may be expected in the southern part of eastern Siberia (Kobak et al.,
  1996). </p>
<p>The biomass densities of larch (<i>Larix sibirica</i>), scotch pine (<i>Pinus
  silvestris</i>), Siberian pine (<i>Pinus sibirica</i>), and birch (<i>Betula
  platyphylla</i>) are projected to decrease by 27.7, 4.3, 28.5, and 2.6 t/ha,
  respectively, under a 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium scenario (Ulziisaikhan, 1996). Such
  decreases seem to be caused by warming air temperature and reduced rainfall
  during the summer season. Gobi and steppe areas in Mongolia would therefore
  expand. </p>
<p>The numbers of all known and endemic species of mammals, birds, and flowering
  plants in Temperate Asia are shown in <a href="#table10-3">Table 10-3</a>. Existing
  factors causing the loss of biodiversity include natural factors, such as storms
  and floods; population pressure; soil erosion and desertification; deforestation
  and timber cutting; and overcollection of wild plant resources (Davis et al.,
  1995; Heywood, 1995). Although global warming will play an important role in
  future changes in biodiversity, human influences also may have the potential
  to affect the climate system (Mooney et al., 1995). Such influences have taken
  the form of rapid, large, and frequent changes in land and resource use; increased
  frequency of biotic invasions; reductions in species numbers; creation of novel
  stresses; and the potential for change in the climate system. <br>

  Climate change may affect the biodiversity in boreal forests of Temperate Asia
  through a myriad of processes and effects: local mortality of boreal species
  and replacement by northern hardwoods or prairies, depending on locale and soil
  type; migration of boreal species northward and coastward, also depending on
  locale and soil type; increased probability of fire; increased or decreased
  soil nutrient availability, depending on permafrost, soil water-holding capability,
  and locale; increased emissions of greenhouse gases-particularly methane-from
  wetlands; and increased probability of outbreaks of pests, particularly insects,
  to drought-stressed trees (Pastor et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Changes in local vegetation zones as a result of global warming could be important
  in marginal areas of the region. For example, in the Kamtchatka Peninsula, five
  ecological zones may be classified (Kojima, 1992): the <i>Larix Kamtchatka</i>
  zone, the <i>Picea ajanensis</i> zone, the Betula ermanii zone, the <i>Pinus
  pumila</i> zone, and the alpine tundra zone. These zones coincide with the division
  by continentality (or oceanity) defined by types of seasonal change, annual
  range, and other characteristics of air temperature. The first three zones are
  boreal forest, under three different climate types: subhumid continental, humid
  continental, and superhumid maritime, respectively. The fourth zone is subalpine,
  corresponding to a humid maritime climate zone. Under global warming, the most
  vulnerable region would be the <i>Larix Kamtchatka</i> zone because of the increasing
  aridity of soils or increasing frequency of forest fires. Major alterations
  in vegetation could be expected, especially in the mountains of the northern
  boreal subzone and the subarctic forest-tundra ecotone in northeast Siberia.
  In the middle and southern boreal subzones, vegetation changes may be more limited
  because of more-resistant species interaction in the forest communities of the
  continental area and the isolated islands of the Kuril, Shantar, and Kommander
  groups (Grishin, 1995). </p>
<p>Plant phenology is an important indicator of vegetation change. It also is
  quite useful and necessary for farmers of intensively cultivated small-hold
  rice fields in this region because their cultivation calendar depends on the
  year-to-year change of seasons, which is reflected in local plant phenology.
  For example, the flowering of cherry blossoms in spring begins about 3-4 days
  earlier per 1°C increase in the mean temperature in March (Yoshino and Ono,
  1996). Leaf-color-change dates of <i>Ginko biloba</i> and <i>Acer palmatum</i>
  in autumn are delayed for 2-7 days per 1°C increase in monthly mean temperature
  (Kai et al., 1996). </p>
