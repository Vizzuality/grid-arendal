<p><i>The survival, health, migration, and distribution of many North American
  marine mammals and sea turtles are expected to be impacted by projected changes
  in the climate through impacts on their food supply, sea-ice extent, and breeding
  habitats</i>. Although some flexibility exists in their need for specific habitats,
  some marine mammals and sea turtles may be more severely affected than others
  by projected changes in the availability of necessary habitat, including pupping
  and nesting beaches; in food supplies; and in associated prey species. Concerns
  are the result primarily of projected changes in seasonal sea-ice extent and
  accelerated succession or loss of coastal ecosystems as a result of projected
  rises in sea level. </p>
<p><b>Coastal Systems</b> (<a href="219.htm#systems">Section 8.3.7</a>). The implications
  of rising sea level are well understood, in part because sea level has been
  rising relative to the land along most of the coast of North America for thousands
  of years. Some coastal areas in the region will experience greater increases
  in sea level than others. Adaptation to rising seas is possible, but it comes
  at ecological, economic, and social costs. </p>
<p><i>In the next century, rising sea level could inundate approximately 50% of
  North American coastal wetlands and a significant portion of dry land areas
  that currently are less than 50 cm above sea level. In some areas, wetlands
  and estuarine beaches may be squeezed between advancing seas and engineering
  structures</i>. A 50-cm rise in sea level would cause a net loss of 17-43% of
  U.S. coastal wetlands, even if no additional bulkheads or dikes are erected
  to prevent new wetland creation as formerly dry lands are inundated. Furthermore,
  in the United States, 8,500-19,000 km<sup>2</sup> of dry land are within 50 cm of high
  tide, 5,700-15,800 km<sup>2</sup> of which currently are undeveloped. Several states in
  the United States have enacted regulations to adapt to climate change by prohibiting
  structures that block the landward migration of wetlands and beaches. The mid-Atlantic,
  south Atlantic, and Gulf coasts are likely to lose large areas of wetlands if
  sea-level rise accelerates. </p>
<p><i>Coastal areas in the Arctic and extreme North Atlantic and Pacific are less
  vulnerable, except where sea ice and/or permafrost currently is present at the
  shoreline.</i> Recent modeling suggests that projected increases in ocean fetches
  as a result of decreases in the period and extent of sea-ice cover could increase
  wave heights by 16-40% and therefore increase coastal erosion during the open-water
  season. Maximum coastal erosion rates are expected to continue in those areas
  where permafrost contains considerable pore, wedge, or massive ice or where
  the permafrost shoreline is exposed to the sea. </p>
<p><i>Rising sea level is likely to increase flooding of low-lying coastal areas
  and associated human settlements and infrastructure.</i> Higher sea levels would
  provide a higher base for storm surges; a 1-m rise would enable a 15-year storm
  to flood many areas that today are flooded only by a 100-year storm. Sea-level
  rises of 30 cm and 90 cm would increase the size of the 100-year floodplain
  in the United States from its 1990 estimate of 50,500 km<sup>2</sup> to 59,500 km<sup>2</sup> and
  69,900 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Assuming that current development trends continue,
  flood damages incurred by a representative property subject to sea-level rise
  are projected to increase by 36-58% for a 30-cm rise and by 102-200% for a 90-cm
  rise. In Canada, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island appears to be especially
  vulnerable, with some of the highest-valued property in the downtown core and
  significant parts of the sewage systems at risk. </p>
<p><i>Saltwater is likely to intrude further inland and upstream</i>. Higher sea
  level enables saltwater to penetrate farther upstream in rivers and estuaries.
  In low-lying areas such as river deltas, saltwater intrusion could contaminate
  drinking water and reduce the productivity of agricultural lands. </p>
<p><b>Human Settlements and Industry</b> (<a href="225.htm">Section 8.3.8</a>).
  Climate change and resulting sea-level rise can have a number of direct effects
  on human settlements, as well as effects experienced indirectly through impacts
  on other sectors. </p>
<p><i>Potential changes in climate could have positive and negative impacts on
  the operation and maintenance costs of North American land and water transportation
  systems</i>. Higher temperatures are expected to result in lower maintenance
  costs for northern transportation systems, especially with fewer freeze-thaw
  cycles and less snow. However, some increased pavement buckling is a possibility
  because of projected longer periods of intense heat. Problems associated with
  permafrost thawing in the Bering Sea region could be particularly severe and
  costly. River and lake transportation could be somewhat more difficult, with
  increases in periods of disruption as a result of projected decreases in water
  levels (e.g., the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway
  system). Increases in the length of the ice-free season could have positive
  impacts for commercial shipping on the inland waterways and in northern ports
  (e.g., Arctic Ocean ports). </p>
