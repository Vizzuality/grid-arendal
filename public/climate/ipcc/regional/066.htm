<h4>4.3.1.2. Soil Properties and Plant Growth </h4>
<p>The impact of climate change on soil is difficult to predict (Jenkinson et
  al., 1991; Gifford et al., 1996a; IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapters A and 4; McMurtrie
  and Comins, 1996; Tate et al., 1996; Thornley and Cannell, 1996). Soil nutrient
  availability is particularly important in Australia, where a high proportion
  of the continent has soils of low nutrient content. Increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration
  and temperature will change the carbon-to-nitrogen ratios of biomass and hence
  of decomposing organic material. Higher temperatures are likely to increase
  the rate of decomposition of organic material; this loss may be partially offset,
  however, by the small observed increases in primary production that can occur
  with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Increases in soil carbon as
  a result of improved stock and pasture management are likely to be significant
  in Australian rangelands (Ash et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Soil water availability is likely to be the most important limiting factor
  for productivity in much of the region, especially in inland Australia and eastern
  districts of New Zealand. Soil water content will be affected by changes in
  rainfall (increases or decreases) and by increased evapotranspiration occurring
  as a result of increased temperature. Tropical forests that experience a long
  dry season-such as those in northern Australia-may be more sensitive to changes
  in rainfall than to changes in temperature. </p>
<p>Increased salinization and alkalization would occur in areas where evaporation
  increased or rainfall decreased (Varallyay, 1994); this development could have
  significant impacts on large areas of Australia's semi-arid zones. In areas
  where salinity is a result of recharge processes, salinization would increase
  if the upstream recharging rainfall increased (Peck and Allison, 1988). Increasing
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration can reduce the impact of salinity on plant growth
  (Nicolas et al., 1993). An increased frequency of higher rainfall events would
  increase soil erosion (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 4.2.1), which would be a concern
  in much of New Zealand's deforested hill country. </p>
<p>Rising levels of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> will have a considerable impact on the growth
  and morphology of plants, with likely increases in potential productivity through
  increases in carbon assimilation, water-use efficiency, and possibly nutrient-use
  efficiency. Increased water-use efficiency under higher CO<sub>2</sub> conditions will
  lead to higher productivity, especially in water-limited systems; but the magnitude
  of the response will depend on other limiting factors such as soil nitrogen
  (Eamus, 1991; Gifford, 1992). Some experiments have shown an "acclimatization"
  or "acclimation" effect, in which the growth response to higher CO<sub>2</sub> in the longer
  term is less than in short-term experiments (Gunderson and Wullschleger, 1994);
  whether this effect applies at the ecosystem level over many years remains untested,
  however. </p>
<p>In temperate zones, increased temperatures generally enhance the rate of plant
  and soil biochemical processes and lead to greater plant productivity. Thus,
  higher air temperatures are likely to increase plant growth in the mid-latitudes
  of New Zealand and southern Australia, where productivity is currently limited
  by lower temperatures. In Australia's tropical areas, however, higher temperature
  stresses (above 35-40°C over extended periods) may result in more frequent damage
  to the vegetation from desiccation and sunscald (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 1.4.3.2).
  In systems where C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species co-exist, their relative proportions may
  or may not change much, depending on the balance between increased photosynthesis
  in C<sub>4</sub> species at higher temperatures and increased photosynthesis in C<sub>3</sub> species
  arising from elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Campbell and Hay, 1993). </p>
<p>Cloudiness has a major influence on the amount of solar radiation reaching
  the Earth's surface. Any changes in cloudiness associated with changing weather
  patterns would directly affect the characteristics of photosynthetically active
  radiation and the amounts of solar UVB radiation, which is often detrimental
  to biota and to the productivity of crop plants and trees (Hunt et al., 1996).
  Many parts of Australasia experience relatively high levels of solar radiation
  and solar UVB radiation. At present, climate models cannot provide reliable
  predictions of how cloudiness might change in the future. </p>
