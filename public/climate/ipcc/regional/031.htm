<h4>2.3.4.1.2. Nigeria</h4>
<p>If sea level rises, inundation could occur along more than 70% of the Nigerian
  coastline, placing land at risk many kilometers inland (Awosika et al., 1992).
  In Nigeria, inundation is the primary threat for at least 96% of the land at
  risk (Awosika et al., 1992; French et al., 1995). With a 1-m rise in sea level,
  up to 600 km<sup>2</sup> of land would be at risk. This area includes parts of Lagos and
  other smaller towns along the coast. For the Mud Coast, a 1-m rise will place
  as much as 2,016 km<sup>2</sup> of land at risk. Even with no acceleration in sea-level
  rise, current rates of land loss through edge erosion alone could cause losses
  of as much as 250 km<sup>2</sup> by the year 2100. This land loss is equivalent to an average
  shoreline recession of 3 km. Erosion threatens a higher percentage of the land
  on the Strand Coast than in the delta (4.6-20.7% for the Strand Coast, versus
  0.8-3.5% for the delta). Without consideration of oil wells in the Niger delta,
  the greatest value at risk is along the Barrier Coast-ranging from just over
  US$1.3 billion with a 0.2-m sea-level rise to almost US$14 billion with a 2-m
  rise. When the value of the oil fields is considered, the value at risk increases
  from US$81.4 million to almost US$2.2 billion with a 0.2-m rise and from US$6
  billion to more than US$19 billion for a 2-m rise. On the Strand Coast, a 1-m
  rise will result in a value loss of more than US$18 billion; the largest contribution
  to this loss would come from the oil fields in the area. </p>
<p>In Nigeria, a potentially massive "environmental refugee" migration will occur.
  For a 1-m rise, more than 3 million people are at risk, based on the present
  population. The estimated number of people that would be displaced ranges from
  740,000 for a 0.2-m rise to 3.7 million for a 1-m rise and 10 million for a
  2-m rise (Awosika et al., 1992). </p>
<h4>2.3.4.1.3. Senegal<a name="2.3.4.1.3"></a></h4>
<p>In Senegal, a 1-m rise in sea level could inundate and erode more than 6,000
  km<sup>2</sup> of land, most of which is wetlands (Dennis et al., 1995). In general, inundation
  is responsible for more than 95% of the land loss, independent of the scenario
  considered. Dennis et al. (1995) have shown that, under a 1-m scenario, buildings
  with a total market value of at least US$499-707 million would be at risk. On
  a national basis, tourist facilities represent 20-30% of the total value at
  risk under the 1-m scenario. Under the 1-m scenario, it is estimated that at
  least 110,000-180,000 people-or 1.4-2.3% of the 1990 population of Senegal-are
  at risk (Dennis et al., 1995). Nearly all of these people are located south
  of the Cape Verde peninsula; the bulk of the population at risk lives south
  of Rufisque. </p>
<h4>2.3.4.1.4. Cote d'Ivoire<a name="2.3.4.1.4"></a></h4>
<p>In Cote d'Ivoire, a 1-m sea-level rise will lead to inundation of 1,800 km<sup>2</sup>
  of lowland. The rate of shoreline retreat as a result of erosion is estimated
  to vary from 4.5 m to 7.4 m per annum (ICST, 1996). The most threatened infrastructures
  on the coastal zone are the Autonomous Port of Abidjan (Port Autonome d'Abidjan,
  PAA) and the port of San Pedro. </p>
<h4>2.3.4.1.5. The Gambia<a name="2.3.4.1.5"></a></h4>
<p>In The Gambia, inundation is projected to lead to a loss of 92 km<sup>2</sup> of land
  for a 1-m sea-level rise. Shoreline retreat is projected to vary between 6.8
  m in cliff areas to about 880 m for flatter and sandier areas (Jallow et al.,
  1996). If a 1-m sea-level rise were to occur as envisaged, without protective
  measures the whole capital city of Banjul would be lost in the next 50-60 years
  because a majority of the city is below 1 m. Preliminary analysis of data from
  the Gambian Department of Lands on the value of land and sample properties between
  Banjul and the Kololi Beach Hotel suggests that about 1,950 billion Dalasis
  (US$217 million) of property will be lost (Jallow et al., 1996). All of the
  structures located on land between Sarro and Banjul cemeteries and the whole
  of Banjul will be lost. (It was not possible to attach monetary value to this
  loss of public places.) According to Jallow et al. (1996), the entire population
  of Banjul (42,000 inhabitants) and people living in the eastern parts of Bakau
  and Cape St. Mary-as well as the swampy parts of Old Jeswang, Kanifing Industrial
  Estate, Eboe Town, Taldning Kunjang, Fagikunda, and Aruko-will be displaced.
</p>
<h4>2.3.4.1.6. Tanzania<a name="2.3.4.1.6"></a></h4>
<p>Using sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5 and 1.0 m per century, Mwaipopo (1997)
  assessed the potential impacts of such a rise on the coastline of Tanzania.
  The results revealed that, with a 0.5-m and 1-m sea-level rise, about 2,090
  km<sup>2</sup> and 2,117 km<sup>2</sup> of land would be inundated, respectively. With a 1-m sea-level
  rise, another 9 km<sup>2</sup> of land would be eroded. Projected damage is expected to
  be about Tsh. (Tanzanian shillings) 50 billion for a 0.5-m rise and Tsh. 86
  billion for 1-m rise. </p>
