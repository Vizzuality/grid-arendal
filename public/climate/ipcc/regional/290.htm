<h4>11.2.3.3. Tropical Cyclones </h4>
<p>Current atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) simulations have
  limited ability to suggest likely changes in tropical cyclone activity; until
  high-resolution GCM simulations are available, it is not possible to say whether
  the frequency, area of occurrence, time of occurrence, mean intensity, or maximum
  intensity of tropical cyclones will change in Tropical Asia. However, more recent
  studies with models of higher resolution appear to be able to simulate tropical
  cyclone climatology (Bengtsson et al., 1995). Bengtsson et al. (1995) found
  a decrease in the number of tropical cyclones under enhanced greenhouse scenarios,
  especially in the Southern Hemisphere, although their geographical distribution
  remained unchanged. </p>
<p>A study by Holland (1997) indicated that tropical cyclones are unlikely to
  be more intense than the worst storms experienced under present-day climate
  conditions-although some potential exists for changes in cyclone intensity in
  tropical oceanic regions, where sea-surface temperature (SST) is betwen 26�C
  and 29�C. According to Henderson-Sellars and Zhang (1997), recent studies indicate
  that the maximum potential intensities of cyclones will remain the same or undergo
  a modest increase of up to 10-20%; they add that these predicted changes are
  small compared with observed natural variations and fall within the uncertainty
  range in current studies. Lal et al. (1995a), in their ECHAm<sup>3</sup>-T106 experiment,
  found no significant change in the number and intensity of monsoon depressions
  in the Indian Ocean in a warmer climate. Similarly, likely changes in the ENSO
  phenomenon under enhanced greenhouse conditions and their possible impact on
  the interannual variability of the summer monsoon are not known. </p>
<p>The spatial patterns of increases in surface temperature during winter (DJF)
  and summer (JJA), simulated by the more recent coupled AOGCMs, tend to confirm,
  to a large extent, the projections of the Climate Impact Group (1992) for the
  monsoon Asian region. Area-averaged increases in temperature for doubled CO<sub>2</sub>
  conditions are, however, lower by 15-20% in the transient experiments (using
  AOGCMs and based on a 1% increase in CO<sub>2</sub>) than in equilibrium experiments (using
  atmospheric GCMs and based on an instantaneous doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> and a mixed-layer
  ocean). The area-averaged increase in summer monsoon rainfall and its spatial
  distribution are highly variable among GCMs, although all models produce an
  increase in monsoon rainfall. </p>
<h4>11.2.4. A Recent Scenario for the Indian Subcontinent<a name="scen"></a> </h4>
<p>The response of the monsoon climate to transient increases in GHGs and sulfate
  aerosols in the Earth's atmosphere has recently been examined by Lal et al.
  (1995b), using data generated by the MPI-ECHAm<sup>3</sup> atmospheric model, coupled to
  a large-scale geostrophic ocean model (ECHAm<sup>3</sup> + LSG). The authors identified
  the potential role of sulfate aerosols in obscuring GHG-induced warming over
  the Indian subcontinent during the past century and found that year-to-year
  variability in simulated monsoon rainfall for the past century is in fair agreement
  with observed climatology. </p>
<p>Lal et al. (1995b) then presented a scenario of climate change for the Indian
  subcontinent for the middle of the next century, taking into account projected
  emissions of GHGs and sulfate aerosols. They suggested an increase in annual
  mean maximum and minimum surface air temperatures of 0.7�C and 1.0�C over the
  land regions in the decade of the 2040s with respect to the 1980s. This warming
  would be less pronounced during the monsoon season than in the winter months.
  A significant decrease in the winter diurnal temperature range, with no appreciable
  change during the monsoon season, also is projected (Lal et al., 1996). Moreover,
  projected warming of the land region of the Indian subcontinent is likely to
  be relatively lower in magnitude than that of the adjoining ocean, resulting
  in a decline in the land-sea thermal contrast-the primary factor responsible
  for the onset of summer monsoon circulation. </p>
<p>As a consequence-and contrary to simulations that consider only CO<sub>2</sub> forcing-Lal
  et al. (1995b) found a decline in mean summer monsoon rainfall of about 0.5
  mm/day over the region, which is marginally above the range of interannual variability
  for the present-day atmosphere. This decline in summer monsoon rainfall resulting
  from combined GHG and aerosol forcing in the southeast Asian region also has
  been suggested in the UKMO GCM experiments (see <a href="310.htm#figureB-2">Figure B-2</a>).
</p>
<p>Despite the great strides that have been made in objective modeling of climate
  and climate change through AOGCMs, there still are uncertainties associated
  with model projections, especially for climate change on regional scales. The
  problem is even more complicated when researchers attempt to project time-dependent
  regional climatic responses to future increases in radiative forcing from anthropogenic
  GHGs and aerosols. Because the anthropogenically induced sulfate aerosol burden
  has large spatial and temporal variations in the atmosphere, its regional-scale
  impacts could be in striking contrast to the impacts of GHGs-the concentrations
  of which are likely, in most cases, to change uniformly throughout the globe.
  Spatially localized radiative forcing resulting from anthropogenic aerosols
  is confined largely to the Northern Hemisphere and tends to yield a steepening
  of normalized meridional temperature gradient in that hemisphere. The effects
  of aerosols also yield distinct precipitation responses in the tropical region
  in general and over the Asian monsoon region in particular. The implications
  of enhanced aerosol loading on tropospheric clouds, which could strongly modulate
  the monsoon climate, still are not clear. Because anthropogenic sulfate aerosol
  loadings are projected to be substantial over the southeast Asian region, their
  impact on the Asian summer monsoon needs to be more carefully examined. Their
  precise magnitude, as well as the roles of other localized potential forcings
  (e.g., aerosols from biomass burning, increases in tropospheric ozone), also
  must be known before confident predictions of regional changes in the monsoon
  climate and its variability can be made. </p>
