<h1>8.4. Integrative Issues </h1>
<p>This chapter has discussed the impacts of climate change on the North American
  region largely in the context of sector-by-sector assessments of plausible impacts.
  Several common characteristics among sectors can be identified, however. Also,
  viewed collectively, interactions between sectors and subregions can be assessed,
  and insights about the integrated nature of the effects of climate change can
  emerge. </p>
<h4>8.4.1. Limitations of Climate Scenarios for Regional Analyses<a name="limit"></a>
</h4>
<p>Most impact studies have assessed how systems would respond to climate change
  resulting from an arbitrary doubling of equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. These
  so-called 2xCO<sub>2</sub> scenarios are limited for regional-scale analyses to the extent
  that they inadequately correspond to the spatial scales of variability in North
  American natural and human systems. They also do not permit an examination of
  the effects of climate variability on physical, biological, and socioeconomic
  systems. Very few studies have considered dynamic responses to steadily increasing
  concentrations of greenhouse gases. Consequently, important insights about the
  ability of systems to respond to changing climate over time are lost. This lack
  of information is of particular concern because the ability of natural ecological
  systems to migrate often may be much slower than the predicted rate of climate
  change. Even fewer studies have examined the consequences of increases beyond
  a doubling of equivalent atmospheric concentrations. </p>
<h4>8.4.2. Regional Texture of Impacts <a name="texture"></a></h4>
<p>All of the potential impacts of climate change exhibit a regional texture.
  Variations in the regional distribution of impacts need to be clearly articulated
  for policymakers. Failure to do so can lead to misleading impressions about
  the potential changes in social welfare as a result of climate change and alternative
  policy responses. A simple look at aggregate impacts on U.S. agriculture, for
  example, might suggest that climate change is not likely to harm agriculture
  enough to significantly affect the overall U.S. economy; policymakers might
  be left with the erroneous impression that no policy-relevant problems exist.
  Distributional differences emerge, however, upon examination of the regional
  texture of agricultural impacts. </p>
<p>Different adaptation strategies and options will be necessary to deal with
  these regional and sectoral differences. In areas where production significantly
  increases-such as the northern edge of agricultural production in North America-additional
  adaptation may be necessary in the development of infrastructure to support
  expanded population and transportation requirements associated with growth.
  The texture of the distribution of sectors and their biological, physical, and
  social components across the North American landscape cannot adequately be captured
  at a fine enough scale to be relevant to long-range planning at the present
  time; these are essential elements of future assessment needs. </p>
<p>It is also recognized-but poorly understood because of limited research-that
  climate change may have some benefits (e.g., it may reduce stress or provide
  opportunities) for certain areas or sectors within North America (e.g., expanded
  agriculture, reduced heating costs) or have a neutral effect on climate-insensitive
  sectors. If one examines any one particular climate impact, it is likely that
  there will be "winners" and "losers" either across subregions or within a subregion
  (e.g., across demographic groups). Nevertheless, the weight of evidence suggests
  that when all potential impacts are considered collectively, every subregion
  will incur some negative impacts of climate change. </p>
<h4>8.4.3. The Role of Adaptation<a name="role"></a> </h4>
<p>Some future climate change is inevitable. Strategies for technological and
  behavioral adaptation offer an opportunity to reduce the vulnerability of sensitive
  systems to the effects of climate change and variability. Some adaptive strategies
  can be undertaken in anticipation of future climate change; others are reactive
  and can be undertaken as the effects of climate change are realized. </p>
<p>Four points must be kept in mind when considering the extent to which adaptive
  strategies should be relied upon. First, adaptation is not without cost. Scarce
  natural and financial resources must be diverted away from other productive
  activities into adaptive practices. These costs must be carefully weighed when
  considering the tradeoffs among adapting to the change, reducing the cause of
  the change, and living with the residual impacts. Second, the economic and social
  costs of adaptation will increase the more rapidly climate change occurs. Third,
  although many opportunities exist for technological and behavioral adaptation,
  uncertainties exist about potential barriers and limitations to their implementation.
  Fourth, uncertainties exist about the efficacy and possible secondary effects
  of particular adaptive strategies. </p>
<h4>8.4.4. Water as a Common Resource Across Sectors and Subregions<a name="common"></a></h4>
<p>Water is a linchpin that integrates many subregions and sectors. Available
  water supplies will be directly affected by climate change, but they also are
  affected by changes in demand from the many sectors that rely upon the water.
  Water is a scarce resource used in the agriculture, forest, and energy sectors.
  It is used in urban areas and in recreational activities. It also is essential
  for the survival of wetlands, nonforest ecosystems, wildlife, and other ecological
  systems. </p>
<p>Assessments of the potential impacts of climate change and variability on any
  of these systems and sectors must account for the inherent competition for water
  supplies and the need for water of varying qualities in various activities.
  For example, in an assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on
  agriculture, an assumption that farmers will be able to adapt to changing climatic
  conditions through a reliance on irrigation is valid only to the extent that
  water is available under future climate scenarios. In many cases, the scarcity
  of available water supplies will increase because of the direct effects of climate
  change on water, as well as increased demands for available water supplies.
