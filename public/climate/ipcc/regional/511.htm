<h1>Latin America</h1>
<p>Latin America includes all continental countries of the Americas from Mexico
  to Chile and Argentina, as well as adjacent seas. The region is highly heterogeneous
  in terms of climate, ecosystems, human population distribution, and cultural
  traditions. Several Latin American countries-especially those of the Central
  American isthmus, Ecuador, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina-are significantly
  affected with adverse socio-economic consequences by seasonal to interannual
  climate variability, particularly the ENSO phenomenon. Most production is based
  on the region's extensive natural ecosystems, and the impacts of current climate
  variability on natural resources suggest that the impacts of projected climate
  changes could be important enough to be taken into account in national and regional
  planning initiatives. Land use is a major force driving ecosystem change at
  present, interacting with climate in complex ways. This factor makes the task
  of identifying common patterns of vulnerability to climate change very difficult.
</p>
<p><i>Ecosystems</i>: Large forest and rangeland areas are expected to be affected
  as a result of projected changes in climate, with mountain ecosystems and transitional
  zones between vegetation types extremely vulnerable. Climate change could add
  an additional stress to the adverse effects of continued deforestation in the
  Amazon rainforest. This impact could lead to biodiversity losses, reduce rainfall
  and runoff within and beyond the Amazon basin (reduced precipitation recycling
  through evapotranspiration), and affect the global carbon cycle. </p>
<p><i>Hydrology and Water Resources</i>: Climate change could significantly affect
  the hydrological cycle, altering the intensity and temporal and spatial distribution
  of precipitation, surface runoff, and groundwater recharge, with various impacts
  on different natural ecosystems and human activities. Arid and semi-arid areas
  are particularly vulnerable to changes in water availability. Hydropower generation
  and grain and livestock production are particularly vulnerable to changes in
  water supply, particularly in Costa Rica, Panama, and the Andes piedmont, as
  well as adjacent areas in Chile and western Argentina between 25�S and 37�S.
  The impacts on water resources could be sufficient to lead to conflicts among
  users, regions, and countries. </p>
<p><i>Food and Fiber Production</i>: Decreases in agricultural production -even
  after allowing for the positive effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on crop growth and moderate
  levels of adaptation at the farm level-are projected for several major crops
  in Mexico, countries of the Central American isthmus, Brazil, Chile, Argentina,
  and Uruguay. In addition, livestock production would decrease if temperate grasslands
  have to face substantial decreases in water availability. Extreme events (e.g.,
  floods, droughts, frosts, storms) have the potential to adversely affect rangelands
  and agricultural production (e.g., banana crops in Central America). The livelihoods
  of traditional peoples, such as many Andean communities, would be threatened
  if the productivity or surface area of rangelands or traditional crops is reduced.
</p>
<p><i>Coastal Systems</i>: Losses of coastal land and biodiversity (including
  coral reefs, mangrove ecosystems, estuarine wetlands, and marine mammals and
  birds), damage to infrastructure, and saltwater intrusion resulting from sea-level
  rise could occur in low-lying coasts and estuaries in countries such as those
  of the Central American isthmus, Venezuela, Argentina, and Uruguay. Sea-level
  rise that blocks the runoff of flatland rivers into the ocean could increase
  the risks of floods in their basins (e.g., in the Argentine Pampas). </p>
<p><i>Human Settlements</i>: Climate change would produce a number of direct and
  indirect effects on the welfare, health, and security of the inhabitants of
  Latin America. Direct impacts resulting from sea-level rise, adverse weather,
  and extreme climatic conditions (e.g., floods, flash floods, windstorms, landslides,
  and cold and heat outbreaks), as well as indirect effects through impacts on
  other sectors such as water and food supply, transportation, energy distribution,
  and sanitation services, could be exacerbated by projected climate change. Particularly
  vulnerable groups include those living in shanty towns in areas around large
  cities, especially where those settlements are established in flood-prone areas
  or on unstable hillsides. </p>
<p><i>Human Health</i>: Projected changes in climate could increase the impacts
  of already serious chronic malnutrition and diseases for some Latin American
  populations. The geographical distributions of vector-borne diseases (e.g.,
  malaria, dengue, Chagas') and infectious diseases (e.g., cholera) would expand
  southward and to higher elevations if temperature and precipitation increase.
  Pollution and high concentrations of ground-level ozone, exacerbated by increasing
  surface temperature, would have the potential to negatively affect human health
  and welfare, especially in urban areas. </p>
<p><i>Conclusions</i>: Increasing environmental deterioration (e.g., changes in
  water availability, losses of agricultural lands, and flooding of coastal, riverine,
  and flatland areas) arising from climate variability, climate change, and land-use
  practices would aggravate socioeconomic and health problems, encourage migration
  of rural and coastal populations, and deepen national and international conflicts.
