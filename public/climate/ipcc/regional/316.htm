<h1>C.1. Introduction </h1>
<p>Global vegetation models (GVM) have in the past decade evolved from largely
  statistical-correlational to more process-based, rendering greater confidence
  in their abilities to address questions of global change. There are generally
  two classes of GVMs, biogeography models and biogeochemistry models. The biogeography
  models place emphasis on determination of what can live where, but either do
  not calculate or only partially calculate the cycling of carbon and nutrients
  within ecosystems. The biogeochemistry models simulate the carbon and nutrient
  cycles within ecosystems, but lack the ability to determine what kind of vegetation
  could live at a given location. BIOME3 has significantly blurred this model
  distinction (Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996). There are over 20 biogeochemistry
  models and about 5 biogeography models. Two of the biogeography models, MAPSS
  (Neilson, 1995) and BIOME3 were used to provide estimates of changes in vegetation
  distribution, density and hydrology for this IPCC special report. These are
  equilibrium models, which simulate the potential 'climax' vegetation that could
  live at any well-drained, upland site in the world under an 'average' seasonal
  climate. Equilibrium models provide useful 'snapshots' of what a terrestrial
  biosphere in equilibrium with its climate might look like, but can provide only
  inferential information about how the biosphere will make transitions from one
  condition to another. This is in contrast to other models, which simulate the
  timeseries of vegetation change at a point (Shugart and Smith, 1996), but which
  do not produce maps of vegetation distribution and function. Fully dynamic versions
  of the spatially-explicit GVMs are being developed and incorporate both biogeography
  and biogeochemistry processes, but the dynamic global vegetation models (DGVM)
  are not yet ready for assessment purposes (Neilson and Running, 1996). Several
  model intercomparison projects are underway and can serve to provide some context
  for the two models used here. One such intercomparison is the VEMAP process.
</p>
<h1>C.2. VEMAP Model Intercomparison <a name="C<sub>2</sub>"></a></h1>
<p>The Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project (VEMAP) compared three
  biogeography models, MAPSS (Neilson, 1995), BIOME2 (Haxeltine et al., 1996),
  and DOLY (Woodward and Smith, 1994; Woodward et al., 1995) and three biogeochemistry
  models TEM (Raich et al., 1991; McGuire et al., 1992; Melillo et al., 1993),
  CENTURY (Parton et al., 1987; Parton et al., 1988; Parton et al., 1993), and
  BIOME-BGC (Hunt and Running, 1992; Running and Hunt, 1993). The two classes
  of global models were intercompared and loosely coupled for an assessment of
  both model capabilities and the potential impacts of global warming on U.S.
  ecosystems (VEMAP Members, 1995). The VEMAP process determined that all the
  models have roughly equal skill in simulating the current environment, but exhibit
  some divergences under alternative climates, in some cases producing vegetation
  responses of opposite sign. </p>
<p>Given the timeframe of this IPCC special report, only MAPSS and BIOME3 were
  able to provide global simulations. MAPSS and BIOME2 (a precursor to BIOME3)
  were found to produce generally similar results under the future climate scenarios
  of the VEMAP process. However, MAPSS is consistently more sensitive to water
  stress, producing a more xeric outcome under future climates and it also has
  a more sensitive response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. That is, when incorporating a direct,
  physiological CO<sub>2</sub> effect, MAPSS produces a larger benefit to vegetation from
  increased water-use-efficiency (VEMAP Members, 1995). </p>
<h1>C.3. Biogeography Model Description<a name="C<sub>3</sub>"></a> </h1>
<p>MAPSS (Mapped Atmosphere-Plant-Soil System; Neilson, 1995) and BIOME3 (Haxeltine
  and Prentice, 1996) are among a new generation of process-based, equilibrium
  biogeographic models (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 1.3.4; VEMAP Members, 1995).
  The models simulate the distribution of potential global vegetation based on
  local vegetation and hydrologic processes and the physiological properties of
  plants. Both models simulate the mixture of vegetation lifeforms, such as trees,
  shrubs, and grasses, that can coexist at a site while in competition with each
  other for light and water. A set of physiologically-grounded 'rules' determines
  whether the woody vegetation will be broadleaved or needleleaved, or evergreen
  or deciduous, as well as other properties. The models also simulate the maximum
  carrying capacity, or vegetation density, in the form of leaf area that can
  be supported at the site, under the constraints of energy and water. Energy
  constraints, largely applicable to cold ecosystems, are prescribed in MAPSS,
  but are simulated by an explicit carbon flux model in BIOME3. The two models
  simulate a similar set of water balance processes, incorporating soil texture
  effects. </p>
<p>Thus, MAPSS and BIOME3 simulate the distribution of vegetation, such as forests,
  savannas, shrubland, grasslands and deserts over all non-wetland sites of the
  Earth, based on the relative densities or productivity of overstory and understory,
  vegetation leaf characteristics and thermal tolerances. The models simulate
  the distribution of generalized vegetation lifeforms (e.g. tree, shrub, grass;
  evergreen-deciduous; broadleaf-needleleaf), rather than species and assemble
  these into a vegetation type classification. There are currently 45 different
  vegetation types simulated by MAPSS and 18 by BIOME3. The vegetation types are
  hierarchical, representing biomes (e.g., boreal forest, temperate savanna, grassland,
  etc.) at the top and more detailed community-level descriptions at the lower
  end (e.g., subtropical, xeromorphic woodland). Only the top of the hierarchy
  is utilized in this analysis. Since both models simulate a full site water balance,
  they are also calibrated and tested hydrologic models, thereby, allowing estimates
  of impacts on water resources fully integrated with the simulated impacts on
  vegetation (Neilson and Marks, 1994; VEMAP Members, 1995). As equilibrium models,
  MAPSS and BIOME3 simulate vegetation distribution and hydrology under an average
  seasonal cycle of climate. They simulate an equilibrium land-surface biosphere
  under current or future climate, but not the transitional vegetation changes
  from one climate to another. Thus, the models show the long term potential consequences
  of climate change, but one can only infer immediate (1-10 year) effects. </p>
<p>MAPSS and BIOME3 contain algorithms that allow the incorporation of a direct
  physiological CO<sub>2</sub> effect. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations can, among other effects,
  enhance productivity and increase the water-use-efficiency (WUE, carbon fixed
  per unit water transpired) of the vegetation thereby reducing the sensitivity
  of the vegetation to drought stress (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section A.2.3; Bazzaz
  et al., 1996; Eamus, 1991). BIOME3 allows a direct CO<sub>2</sub> effect on both productivity
  and water-use-efficiency. MAPSS accomplishes the same effect by reducing stomatal
  conductance, which then results in increased leaf area, thus indirectly incorporating
  a productivity effect. Individual species exhibit variations in their expressions
  of direct CO<sub>2</sub> effects. For example, the productivity and WUE effects are not
  necessarily tightly coupled (Eamus, 1996a). However, since the models simulate
  functional types, rather than species, both models have generalized the direct
  CO<sub>2</sub> effects to all vegetation, with the exception in BIOME3 of differentiating
  C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> physiological types. In BIOME3 C<sub>4</sub> plants do not experience the elevated
  growth of C<sub>3</sub> plants, but do experience increased water-use-efficiency. The realized
  importance of the direct CO<sub>2</sub> processes in complex, mature ecosystems remains
  a matter of debate (Bazzaz et al., 1996). </p>
<p>A review of 58 studies indicated an average 32% increase in plant dry mass
  under a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Wullschleger, Post, and King, 1995).
  Norby (1996) documented an average 29% increase in annual growth per unit leaf
  area in seven broadleaf tree species under 2 x CO<sub>2</sub> over a wide range of conditions.
  Increased WUE, examined in another review, averaged about 30-40% as indexed
  by reductions in leaf conductance to water vapor (Eamus, 1991). If such responses
  were maintained in forests over many decades, they would imply a substantial
  potential for increased storage of atmospheric carbon, as well as conferring
  some increased tolerance to drought due to increased WUE. However, some species
  or ecosystems exhibit acclimation to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> by downregulating photosynthesis
  (Bazzaz, 1990; Grulke et al., 1993; Grulke et al., 1990); while others do not
  exhibit acclimation (Bazzaz, 1990; Teskey, 1997). Most of the early CO<sub>2</sub> research
  was done on juvenile trees in pots and growth chambers. New research is beginning
  to emerge which focuses on larger trees or intact forested ecosystems. Recent
  reviews of this newer literature (Eamus, 1996a; Curtis, 1996) indicate that
  acclimation may not be as prevalent when roots are unconstrained and also that
  leaf conductance may not be reduced and that both responses are dependent on
  the experimental conditions, the length of exposure and the degree of nutrient
  or water stress. These results imply that forests could produce more leaf area
  under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, but may not gain a benefit from increased WUE. In fact,
  with increased leaf area, transpiration should increase on a per tree basis
  and the stand would use more water. Elevated temperatures would increase transpiration
  even further, perhaps drying the soils and inducing a drought effect on the
  ecosystem (ibid). Prominent among the environmental influences that are thought
  to moderate long-term responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> is nitrogen supply (Kirschbaum
  et al., 1994; McGuire et al., 1995; Eamus, 1996b). Unless CO<sub>2</sub> stimulates an
  increase in N mineralization (Curtis et al., 1995), productivity gains in high
  CO<sub>2</sub> are likely to be constrained by the system's N budget (Körner, 1995). Nitrogen
  limitations may constrain carbon gains to structural tissue, rather than leaves
  (Curtis et al., 1995). Thus, in areas receiving large amounts of N deposition,
  a direct CO<sub>2</sub> response could result in large increases in leaf area, increasing
  transpiration and possibly increasing sensitivity to drought via rapid soil
  water depletion. Early growth increases may disappear as the system approaches
  carrying capacity as limited by water or nutrients (Körner, 1995). Shifts in
  species composition will likely result from different sensitivities to elevated
  CO<sub>2</sub> (Bazzaz et al., 1996; Körner, 1995). Both MAPSS and BIOME3 have been operated
  with and without the direct CO<sub>2</sub> effects in this study in order to gauge the
  importance and sensitivity of the processes within the modeling framework. The
  direct effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> are imparted only in the ecological model processes
  and not in the GCMs. There are no feedbacks between the ecological and atmospheric
  models </p>
<p>The MAPSS model also contains a fire model that shifts some vegetation to a
  'fire climax' state, such as in many grasslands or savannas. BIOME3 embeds these
  processes in the calibration. Neither model considers current or past land-use
  practices. Thus, some areas that the models indicate as grassland, for example,
  might actually be shrublands, due to either grazing or fire suppression. Although
  the two models do not simulate actual land-use, the 'potential' land-cover simulated
  by the models should provide an accurate estimate of the land-surface potential.
  That is, forests cannot be grown in deserts or shrublands without irrigation;
  and, agricultural productivity should be higher in a potential forest landscape
  than in a potential shrubland landscape (given similar soils). Changes in LAI
  can be interpreted as a change in the overall carrying capacity or standing
  crop of the site, regardless of whether it is in potential natural vegetation
  or under cultivation. Additions from irrigation or nitrogen could alter this
  conclusion, but it should hold for non-irrigated, upland systems. Thus, simulated
  changes in potential natural vegetation should be valuable indicators of general
  shifts in agricultural potential. </p>
