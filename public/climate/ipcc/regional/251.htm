<h4>9.3.5. Agriculture and Fisheries </h4>
<h4>9.3.5.1. Agriculture<a name="agri"></a> </h4>
<p>The climate-sensitive agricultural sector is important to the subsistence economies
  of many island states (SPREP, 1994a, 1994b, 1996). On many islands, agricultural
  production systems already are stressed as a consequnce of high population densities
  and growth rates. Few studies have been conducted specifically on the effects
  of climate change on agriculture in small islands (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
  13.6.4). However, those investigations that have been undertaken suggest that
  although CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization might have a beneficial effect-mainly on C<sub>3</sub> crops-the
  net effect of climate change is unlikely to be beneficial (Singh et al., 1990;
  Singh, 1994; SPREP, 1996). </p>
<p>Examination of the agricultural impacts of climate variability associated with
  seasonal to interannual climate phenomena offers valuable insight into the potential
  effects of climate change on agriculture. Climate change and climate variability
  effects that alter the rainfall regime, increase evaporation, or reduce soil
  moisture would affect agricultural production-possibly with adverse consequences
  for food security and nutrition in many countries. Crop yields in small island
  states in the Pacific are projected to decrease as a consequence of reduced
  solar radiation (resulting from increased cloudiness), higher temperatures (causing
  shorter growth duration and increased sterility in some cultivars), and changes
  in water availability (because of changes in the frequency of droughts and floods,
  as well as changes in their spatial and temporal distribution) (Singh et al.,
  1990). Seawater intrusion also would degrade the fertility of coastal soils
  and consequently contribute to a reduction in yields (IPCC 1996, WGII, Sections
  13.6.4 and 13.7). Some of these adverse consequences of climate change may be
  partially offset, however, by the beneficial effects of increased atmospheric
  CO<sub>2</sub> (SPREP, 1996). </p>
<p>Singh (1994) projects that, for small islands in the Pacific, an extension
  of the dry season by 45 days would lead to a decrease in maize yields of 30-50%.
  Similarly, yields from sugarcane and taro would be reduced by 10-35% and 35-75%,
  respectively. On the other hand, Singh et al. (1990) found that significantly
  increased rainfall (>50%) during the wet season on the windward side of the
  larger islands would cause taro yields to increase by 5-15%, but would reduce
  rice yields by approximately 10-20% and maize yields by 30-100%. </p>
<p>In Tuvalu, contraction of the freshwater lens on the atolls (as a result of
  increasing water demand and sea-level rise) is expected to reduce crop yields
  severely. At locations such as Funafuti atoll, where there already is heavy
  demand on the water supply, the effects of sea-level rise will exacerbate water
  scarcity. The crop expected to be most seriously affected is pulaka (giant taro).
  Reduced yields from pulaka pits are "likely to have significant cultural ramifications,
  given the central role of this crop in Tuvaluan society" (SPREP, 1996, Section
  6.4.1). The cultivation of taro, another important subsistence crop in the Pacific
  islands, would be similarly threatened (see <a href="#box9-2">Box 9-2</a>).

      <p>The pit cultivation of taro is particularly susceptible to changes in
	freshwater quality. Taro is grown in depressions and pits that have been
	excavated down to the freshwater lens and partly filled with composting
	organic matter. Leaves of many species-including <i>Guettarda speciosa</i>,
	<i>Tournefortia argentea</i>, <i>Artocarpus altilis</i>, <i>Triumfetta
	procumbens</i>, and <i>Hibiscus tiliaceus</i>-are used to form the organic
	soil. In Kiribati, taro (C. Chamissonis) is planted in 20-m x 10-m pits,
	2-3 m deep, with the taro corm placed in "organic baskets" of <i>Pandanus</i>
	and <i>Cocos nucifera</i> and anchored in holes 60 cm below the water
	level. In Puluwat Atoll, in contrast, the taro is planted in organic-matter
	bundles 0.5 m above the water level. Taro swamps also are sites of high
	evapotranspiration; increased loss of freshwater will increase the risk
	of saltwater intrusion. </p>
      <p>A rise in sea level will have a serious impact on atoll agroforestry
	and the pit cultivation of taro. Erosional changes in the shoreline will
	disrupt populations, and the combined effects of freshwater lens loss
	and increased storm surges will stress freshwater plants and increase
	vulnerability to drought (Wilkinson and Buddemeier, 1994).</p>

  Recent research has attempted to assess changes in world prices for selected
  crops, based on GCM projections. Reilly et al. (1994) estimate that, under the
  GFDL scenario, world prices for most crop commodities would fall relative to
  baseline prices; the exceptions are rice and sugar, which would rise by approximately
  30% and 15%, respectively. Should such a projected increase in the price of
  world sugar occur, positive economic benefits (in the form of increased foreign
  exchange earnings) would accrue to the economies of sugar-exporting small island
  states. The estimated price increases are somewhat less for scenarios that include
  adaptation. In the GISS scenario, prices for soybeans, groundnuts, cotton, and
  tobacco fell by about 10-15% with adaptation. Prices for other crop commodities
  considered in the analysis rose by as much as 20% (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
  13.8.2). </p>
<p>Although these scenarios do not address small island states specifically, some
  of the results would be relevant to any analysis of climate change impacts on
  agriculture in these nations. To the extent that island states depend heavily
  on food imports and export some agricultural products, such projected price
  changes would have a considerable impact on the ability of these countries to
  earn much-needed foreign exchange. </p>
