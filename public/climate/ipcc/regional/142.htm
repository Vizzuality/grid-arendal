<p>A series of studies in all of the countries of the Central American isthmus
  under the Central America Project on Climate Change-with the cooperation of
  the USCSP-estimated the vulnerability of agricultural resources. These studies
  were based on scenarios generated through a set of GCMs, including CCC-J1, UKMO-H3,
  GISS-G1, GFDL-A1, and GFDL-K2. The studies focused on specific crops (e.g.,
  maize, rice, sorghum, beans)-surprisingly enough, however, not on export crops,
  such as bananas and coffee. A full summary of the results of these studies would
  be tedious, and they are not highly reliable (as indicated in the Executive
  Summary of the report, the aforementioned GCMs, in general, are not quite fitted
  for this type of specific study). Therefore, <a href="#box6-4">Box 6-4</a> presents
  a case study to provide information about the nature of the results achieved
  in this first exercise to fulfill the UNFCCC's national reporting requirement.

      <p>Under the coordination of the Proyecto Centroamericano de Cambios Climáticos
	(PCCC) and with the support of the USCSP, vulnerability studies were undertaken
	on the impact of climate change on the agricultural sector in Central
	America. The methodology considered the acquisition and analysis of data;
	the use of agroclimatological models; and the performance of biophysical
	studies, involving simulations under base and modified climates and the
	evaluation of results (t/ha, crop duration, evapotranspiration). Scenarios
	selected included a range of temperature changes between +1°C and +2°C
	and precipitation changes ranging from +20 mm to -20 mm, at 10-mm intervals.
      </p>
      <p><u>Impacts of Climate Change on Maize, Red Kidney Beans, and Rice Production
	in Belize </u></p>
      <p>The field experiment took place in two places: one rain-fed area, for
	maize and beans; and one dryland area, for rice. The basic data included
	detailed soil information, maximum and minimum temperatures, daily sunshine
	hours, and precipitation; the model computed other required variables.
	The model also included management information (date, amount, type, fertilizer
	applications, depth and spacing of the plant, and planting date). </p>
      <p>The conclusions of this assessment may be synthesized as follows: On
	the whole, simulated changes in crop yields are driven by two factors-changes
	in climate (temperature and precipitation) and CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment. The interactions
	of these factors on baseline crop growth are often complex. However, yield
	decreases are caused primarily by the increase in temperature, which shortens
	the duration of crop growth stages. New and fluctuating weather patterns
	could have a strong negative impact on economic activities in agriculture.
	The majority of Belizean people who are highly dependent on farming might
	well see their livelihoods destroyed by reduced rainfall and increased
	temperatures as a consequence of climate change. Agriculture continues
	to be a major part of the economy of Belize. Therefore, planning and evaluating
	strategies for adapting to climate change are important.</p>

  Regarding the relationship between agriculture and water resources, the studies
  mentioned above are limited to the known impacts of water deficits on agricultural
  activities. However, information about some cash crops in countries of the Central
  American isthmus indicates that, under current climate conditions, the productivity
  of banana crops is historically affected, particularly in areas already subject
  to flooding, by environmental conditions associated with tropical storms. This
  preexisting condition would indicate that, along the Central American-Caribbean
  watershed, these crops could be additionally stressed if climate change leads
  to increasing frequency of storms and heavy precipitation (Campos, 1996). </p>
<p>In climatic studies involving projections of GCMs and crop models of wheat,
  maize, barley, soybeans, potatoes, and grapes in Latin America (<a href="#table6-7">Table
  6-7</a>), crop yields decreased in the face of climate change-even when direct
  effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> were taken into account-in 9 of 12 studies. Experience
  available with regard to the development and spread of pests and diseases permits
  the inference that climate change would trigger many of them and extend their
  geographical ranges (Austin-Bourke, 1955; Omar, 1980; Pedgley, 1980). <br>

  One area that is highly vulnerable to climate change is the Brazilian northeast,
  which is strongly influenced by the ENSO phenomenon. Years with no rain are
  frequent; these periods are characterized by the occurrence of famine and large-scale
  migrations to metropolitan areas (Magalhães and Glantz, 1992; IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Section 13.7; IPCC 1996, WG III, Section 6.5.9). In the global agricultural
  model of Rosenzweig et al. (1993), yield impacts of climate change in Brazil
  are among the most severe for all regions. Under 2xCO<sub>2</sub> scenarios, yields are
  projected to fall by 17-53%, depending on whether direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> are
  considered. Similar reductions also are projected for Uruguay and Mexico (Conde
  et al., 1996; IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.6.6). </p>
<p>Agroindustries that depend on primary production will be vulnerable to climate
  changes (see <a href="147.htm">Section 6.3.7</a>). Capital-intensive livestock
  operations, which depend on grassland production, also are likely to be negatively
  affected (Parry et al., 1988; Baker et al., 1993; Klinedinst et al., 1993).
  Impacts may be minor, however, for relatively intense livestock production systems
  (e.g., confined beef, dairy, poultry, swine) (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.5).
</p>
<p>Climate change also will affect the distribution and degree of infestation
  of insects indirectly through climatic effects on hosts, predators, competitors,
  and insect pathogens. There is some evidence that the risk of crop loss will
  increase as a result of poleward expansion of insect distribution ranges. Insect
  species characterized by high reproduction rates generally are favored (Porter
  et al., 1991). Human alteration of conditions that affect host plant survival-irrigation,
  for example-also affects phytophagous (leaf-eating) insect populations. </p>
<p>The occurrence of plant fungal and bacterial pests depends on temperature,
  rainfall, humidity, radiation, and dew. Climatic conditions affect the survival,
  growth, and spread of pathogens, as well as the resistance of hosts. Friederich
  (1994) summarizes the observed relationship between climatic conditions and
  important plant diseases. In Latin America, warm, humid conditions lead to earlier
  and stronger outbreaks of late potato blight (Phytophthora infestans), as in
  Chile in the early 1950s (Austin-Bourke, 1955; Löpmeier, 1990; Parry et al.,
  1990). Warmer temperatures would likely shift the occurrence of these diseases
  into presently cooler regions (Treharne, 1989). </p>
<p>As a result of these trends, farmers with limited financial resources and farming
  systems with few adaptive technological opportunities to limit or reverse the
  impacts of climate change may suffer significant disruption and financial loss
  from relatively small changes in crop yield and productivity (Parry et al.,
  1988; Downing, 1992). Conflict is likely to arise between alternative uses of
  land areas under changing climate conditions-for example, competition for the
  same land may arise between expanding agriculture and other land uses (e.g.,
  conservation, afforestation, population relocation). </p>
<p>Disparities in agricultural impact between developed and developing countries
  can be affected by international markets-which can moderate or reinforce local
  and national exchanges (Reilly et al., 1994; Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994). Countries
  whose economies rely strongly on agricultural production would face major imbalances
  between production costs and international prices. According to Rosenzweig and
  Parry (1994), modeled yield changes in low-latitude countries are primarily
  negative, even though direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> on plants, moderate levels of adaptation
  at the farm level, and production and price responses of the world food system
  were considered. Economic limitations, social conflicts (e.g., farmers' reluctance
  to abandon traditional practices), and environmental problems (e.g., salinization
  resulting from increased irrigation, which is not considered in the models)
  are likely to severely limit the capacity for adaptation and hinder the expansion
  of agricultural frontiers. Estimated net economic impacts of climate change
  on crops are negative for several Latin American countries analyzed by Reilly
  et al. (1994), even when modest levels of adaptation are considered. The only
  exception would be Argentina because, as a major exporter of grain, it should
  benefit from high world prices even if yields fall. </p>
