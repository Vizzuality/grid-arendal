<h4>11.3.7. Human Health </h4>
<p>Vector-borne diseases are significant causes of mortality and morbidity in
  Tropical Asia. Climate change may cause a change in the distribution of malaria,
  dengue, bilharzia, leishmaniasis, and schistosomiasis. The region also is particularly
  vulnerable to extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, storms, and
  floods. The vulnerability of the population to these events is significantly
  increased by high population densities and poor sanitation; thus, waterborne
  and food-borne infectious diseases also are major problems. For example, waterborne
  and waterrelated diseases account for about 70% of the epidemic emergencies
  in India. The additional impacts of climate change, superimposed on existing
  conditions, could seriously exacerbate health problems. </p>
<h4>11.3.7.1. Malaria<a name="malaria"></a> </h4>
<p>Malaria is the most serious and widespread tropical disease in the world today.
  In most areas of the Asia-Pacific region where malaria now occurs, its distribution
  was considerably reduced or eliminated during the 1960s and 1970s. In recent
  years, however, the situation has been worsening in frontier regions of economic
  development (Porter, 1994). The emergence and rapid spread of drug-resistant
  malaria have become major health concerns to all malaria-affected countries
  in the region (WHO, 1996a). </p>
<p>Climate has a direct influence on malaria mosquitoes because each species has
  a range of climate conditions suitable for its development (see <a href="#figure11-4">Figure
  11-4</a>). Climate also has an indirect effect on malaria through its influence
  on suitable vegetation and vector breeding sites. Precipitation is important
  because mosquitoes require water to lay their eggs, as well as for the subsequent
  development of larvae. <br>

  Several estimates of the potential distribution of malaria have been produced,
  using climate change scenarios from a number of GCMs. These projections indicate
  that, in the future, malaria is most likely to extend its range into the fringes
  of established endemic areas (Martens et al., 1995). In southeast Asia, this
  would include new areas of Indonesia-notably Sumatra and Irian Jaya-and Papua
  New Guinea (Porter, 1994). Martin and Lefebvre (1995) report that the intensity
  and extent of malaria's potential transmission would change significantly under
  scenarios generated by the five GCMs they used. In all cases, an increase in
  seasonal malaria at the expense of perennial malaria results; such an increase
  is most likely to lead to epidemics among unprepared or nonimmune populations.
  Similarly, Martens et al. (1995) conclude that newly affected populations would
  initially experience high case-fatality rates because of their lack of naturally
  acquired immunity. </p>
<p>Increased incidence of malaria associated with climate change may significantly
  strain the economies of many countries of the region. Picard and Mills (1992)
  estimated losses of five working days for infected persons, during the period
  from infection to recovery, in two districts in Nepal. Mills (1994) found that
  the economic consequences of malaria could be high in the areas without malaria-control
  programs. The high cost of alternative drugs has put enormous pressure on the
  scarce economic resources of the countries in Asia (WHO, 1996a). ISPAN (1992)
  estimated that a complete course of treatment in rural Bangladesh may cost one
  month's wage for an agricultural worker (about US$40), or roughly one-fifth
  of overall per capita income. Hammer (1993) discusses the economics of malaria
  treatment and cites examples from Nepal, Thailand, and Indonesia-where the economic
  return of malaria treatment was found to be substantial. </p>
