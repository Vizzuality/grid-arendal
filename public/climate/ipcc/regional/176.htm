<p><i>Increases in hydrological variability (larger floods and longer droughts)
  are likely to result in increased sediment loading and erosion, degraded shorelines,
  reductions in water quality, reduced water supply for dilution of point-source
  water pollutants and assimilation of waste heat loads, and reduced stability
  of aquatic ecosystems</i>. Projected changes in snowfall and snowmelt-as well
  as suggested increases in warm-period rainfall intensity-could shift the periodicity
  of the flood regime in North America, possibly stressing the adequacy of dams,
  culverts, levees, storm drains, and other flood prevention infrastructures.
  The impacts of flooding are likely to be largest in arid regions, where riparian
  vegetation is sparse; in agricultural areas during winter, when soils are more
  exposed; and in urban areas with more impervious surfaces. Increases in hydrological
  variability may reduce productivity and biodiversity in streams and rivers and
  have large impacts on water resources management in North America, with increased
  expenditures for flood management. Increases in water temperature and reduced
  flows in streams and rivers may result in lower dissolved oxygen concentrations,
  particularly in summer low-flow periods in low- and mid-latitude areas. </p>
<p><i>Projected increases in human demand for water would exacerbate problems
  associated with the management of water supply and quality</i>. Managing increased
  water demands will be particularly problematic in regions experiencing increases
  in variability and declines in runoff. Improved management of water infrastructure,
  pricing policies, and demand-side management of supply have the potential to
  mitigate some of the impacts of increasing water demand. </p>
<p><b>Food and Fiber: Agriculture</b> (<a href="204.htm">Section 8.3.4</a>).
  As the climate warms, crop patterns will shift northward. Most studies of these
  shifts have focused on changes in average climate and assume farmers effectively
  adapt. They have not fully accounted for changes in climate variability, water
  availability, and imperfect responses by farmers to changing climate. Future
  consideration of these factors could either increase or decrease the magnitude
  of changes projected by these earlier studies. </p>
<p><i>Climate modifications that lead to changes in daily and interannual variability
  in temperatures and, in particular, precipitation will impact crop yields.</i>
  Although changes in average temperature and precipitation can be expected to
  impact agriculture, few studies have considered the effects of increased climate
  variability on crop and livestock production. Increased variability in daily
  and interannual temperature and precipitation are likely to be as important
  or more important than the effects of mean changes in climate. Droughts, floods,
  and increased risks of winter injury will contribute to a greater frequency
  and severity of crop failure. An increased reliance on precision farming has
  increased vulnerability to climate variability outside a narrow range of change.
  These impacts are projected to be both site- and crop-specific; reliable forecasts
  for such occurrences, however, are not yet regionally available. </p>
<p><i>The direct effects of a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> on crop yields are largely beneficial</i>.
  Food and fiber production for crops like cotton, soybean, and wheat are expected
  to increase an average of 30% (range -10% to +80%) in response to a doubling
  of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The magnitude of this response will be highly variable
  and will depend on the availability of plant nutrients, temperature, and precipitation.
</p>
<p><i>Crop losses due to weeds, insects, and diseases are likely to increase and
  may provide additional challenges for agricultural sector adaptation to climate
  change</i>. Less severe winters due to climate change may increase the range
  and severity of insect and disease infestations. Increasing pressure to reduce
  chemical inputs (i.e., pesticides) in agriculture will necessitate a greater
  emphasis on concepts of integrated pest management and targeted application
  of agricultural chemicals through precision agricultural technologies. </p>
<p><i>Recent analyses of issues of long-run sustainability associated with agricultural
  adaptation to climate change from an arbitrary doubling of equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations
  have concluded that there is considerably more sectoral flexibility and adaptation
  potential than was found in earlier analyses.</i> Much of this reassessment
  arises from a realization that the costs and benefits of climate change cannot
  be adequately evaluated independently of behavioral, economic, and institutional
  adjustments required by changing climate. Although scientific controversy over
  the nature and rate of climate change remains, most existing scenarios suggest
  gradual changes in mean climate over decades-providing ample opportunities for
  adaptation measures to be implemented within vulnerable subregions of North
  America. However, uncertainties remain about the implications of changes in
  climate variability, as well as crop responses to increases beyond a doubling
  of equivalent atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. </p>
<p><i>Existing studies that have looked at changes in mean temperature and precipitation
  suggest that climate change is not likely to harm agriculture enough to significantly
  affect the overall economy of North America</i>. The economic consequences of
  climate change to U.S. agriculture are expected to be both positive and negative,
  depending on the nature of temperature and precipitation changes that occur
  in specific subregions. Subregions of North America that are dependent on agriculture
  may be more vulnerable than areas offering economic diversity. The Great Plains
  area, for example, relies heavily on crop and livestock production and, as a
  result, is potentially vulnerable to climate change, with negative consequences
  projected for southern extremes and potential positive impacts in northern areas
  as temperatures rise. Warmer temperatures at northern latitudes may lessen the
  adverse effects of frost damage, but the risk of early- and late-season frost
  will remain a barrier to the introduction of new crops. </p>
<p><i>Consumers and producers could gain or lose; the long-term stability of the
  forest-products market is uncertain</i>. Consumer prices could increase by 100-250%
  with severe forest dieback, producing losses of 4-20% of the net value of commercial
  forests. Alternatively, consumer prices could decrease with increased forest
  growth and harvest in Canada, and producers could sustain economic losses. With
  exports from Canada to the United States, however, the net changes (consumers
  plus producers) could be negative for Canadians and positive for the U.S. market.
