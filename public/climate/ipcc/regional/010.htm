<h1>2.2. Regional Climate</h1>
<p>The continent of Africa is characterized by several climatic regimes and ecological
  zones. All parts of the continent, except the Republic of South Africa, Lesotho,
  and the Mediterranean countries north of the Sahara, have tropical climates.
  These tropical climates may be divided into three distinct climatic zones: wet
  tropical climates, dry tropical climates, and alternating wet and dry climates
  (Huq et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Several comprehensive descriptions of the climates of Africa exist, most notably
  those of Thomson (1965) and Griffiths (1972). Surveys of African rainfall have
  been carried out by Newell et al. (1972), Kraus (1977), Klaus (1978), Tyson
  (1986), and Nicholson (1994b). These researchers agree that summer rainfall
  maxima, which are dominant over most of Africa, are controlled primarily by
  the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Over land, the ITCZ tends to follow
  the seasonal march of the sun and oscillates between the fringes of the Sahara
  in boreal summer and the northern Kalahari desert in the austral summer. The
  latitude zones of these arid and semi-arid deserts demarcate the tropics from
  the subtropics. Rainfall in the subtropics is modulated by mid-latitude storms,
  which may be displaced Equator-ward in winter. Further modification of these
  broad patterns is provided by natural features such as lakes and mountains,
  and by the influence of ocean currents. The poleward extremes of the continent
  have extratropical influences associated with mid-latitude synoptic disturbances,
  resulting in significant winter rainfall (Griffiths, 1972). <br>

<p>In general, surface air temperatures over most of Africa display a high degree
  of thermal uniformity, spatially and seasonally (Riehl, 1979). The extreme north
  and south of the continent, however, experience cold frontal systems that quasi-regularly
  introduce abrupt air mass changes. Temperatures there are more variable in response
  to a large annual cycle of insolation and the effects of seasonally varying
  air masses and winds. Mean temperature trends over the past 100 years, averaged
  over continental Africa, are shown in <a href="#figure2-2">Figure 2-2</a>. The
  highland areas of eastern and southern Africa are substantially cooler than
  lowland regions, and there is evidence that recent warming trends may have been
  exaggerated in these mountain areas (Hulme, 1996a). <br>

	    <p>African economies have made relatively low levels of investment in
	  infrastructure and directly productive capital goods-and hence continue
	  to rely heavily on natural capital (natural resources). This natural
	  capital is at risk because poverty and high population growth often
	  induce land degradation and deforestation-which in turn lead to growing
	  food insecurity and loss of biodiversity. This pattern contributes to
	  migration into rural areas that often are less suitable for agricultural
	  expansion and to urban areas with inappropriate physical, social, and
	  economic infrastructure. The process also contributes to population
	  growth by creating an incentive for large families: Adding family labor
	  becomes one way of coping with the increasing time costs of gathering
	  fuel and water and clearing new land. The severity of this population-agriculture-environment
	  nexus is compounded by low investment in human capital (human resource
	  development), which often restricts individuals to continued reliance
	  on unskilled labor and short-term exploitation of natural resources
	  (the land) as the only feasible survival options. </p>
        <p>Although Africa's youthful population represents future social capital,
	  a great deal of investment in terms of education, training, and skills
	  development will be required to ensure its full productivity in the
	  next decade and beyond. Particular attention will need to be paid to
	  capacity-building in information technology to better prepare African
	  societies for efficient, sustainable management of the continent's fragile
	  resources. In addition, the region's political structures, which determine
	  decision making in resource allocation and consumption, will have to
	  be stabilized.</p>

  Rainfall over Africa exhibits high spatial and temporal variability (see <a href="#figure2-3">Figures
  2-3</a> and <a href="#figure2-4">2-4</a>). Mean annual rainfall ranges from
  as low as 10 mm in the innermost core of the Sahara to more than 2,000 mm in
  parts of the equatorial region and other parts of west Africa (<a href="#figure2-4">Figure
  2-4</a>). The rainfall gradient is largest along the southern margins of the
  Sahara-the region known as the Sahel-where mean annual rainfall varies by more
  than 1,000 mm over about 750 km. This tight rainfall gradient means that relatively
  small changes in the position of the ITCZ can have large consequences for rainfall
  in the Sahel; thus, this region is a sensitive indicator of climate change in
  Africa. Coefficients of rainfall variability in Africa exceed 200% in the deserts;
  they are about 40% in most semi-arid regions, and between 5% and 20% in the
  wettest areas (<a href="#figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a>). <br>

  Most policymakers now recognize drought as a normal feature of Africa's climate
  and acknowledge that its recurrence is inevitable. Widespread occurrences of
  severe drought during the past three decades have repeatedly underscored the
  vulnerability of developed and developing societies to its ravages in Africa.
  Although the variability of African climate is inevitable, loss of human life
  and economic disruption associated with extreme climatic fluctuation can be
  lessened by advance warning. Recent scientific advances in understanding the
  climate system and breakthroughs in predictive capabilities on seasonal time
  scales provide an opportunity to reduce the vulnerability of human societies
  by planning for previously unexpected variations from mean climatic conditions.
  Current forecasting capabilities, although by no means perfect, provide a better
  indication of climatic conditions that are expected to prevail during the next
  season or two than simply assuming that rainfall and temperature will be normal
  (Bonkoungou, 1996). </p>
