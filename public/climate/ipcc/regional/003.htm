<h1>1.3. Baseline Data and Climate Scenarios</h1>
<h4>1.3.1. Climate Observations</h4>
<p>Current trends in regional variations of temperature and precipitation also
  are important parts of the baseline against which the potential effects of climate
  change should be assessed. IPCC (1996, WG I, Chapter 3) provided time series
  plots and global maps depicting trends for temperature and precipitation. This
  information was extended and updated by one of the lead authors of the WG I
  assessment (T. Karl, USA). The information was provided to the regional assessment
  lead authors and is contained in <a href="305.htm">Annex A</a> of this special
  report, which describes the data sets used for depicting these trends. Additional
  information based on regional analyses has been added to several of the regional
  chapters by the lead authors. </p>
<h4>1.3.2. Climate Scenarios<a name="scenarios"></a></h4>
<p>GCM-based scenarios are the most credible and frequently used projections of
  climate change. Other types of climate projections include synthetic scenarios
  and analogue scenarios. These approaches and their limitations are described
  in IPCC (1994b). </p>
<p>In the IPCC's second assessment (1996, WG I, Chapter 6), seven regions were
  identified for regional analysis of climate simulations. That analysis was based
  on transient runs with atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs)
  suitable for construction of regional climate scenarios, using additional regionalization
  techniques to improve the simulation of regional climate change. The team of
  lead authors that conducted that analysis, led by F. Giorgi and G. Meehl, prepared
  information on the simulation of regional climate change with global coupled
  climate models and regional modeling techniques for use by the regional assessment
  teams. That information, which is presented in <a href="306.htm">Annex B</a> of this report, is based
  entirely on the information included in the WG I contribution to the SAR. No
  new information has been added to the previous analysis. </p>
<p>The wide range of changes in temperature and precipitation indicated at the
  time of doubled CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for each region is illustrated
  in Figures <a href="307.htm#figureB-1">B-1</a> and <a href="310.htm#figureB-2">B-2</a>,
  which show large model-to-model differences. <a href="306.htm">Annex B</a> provides
  the following conclusion regarding the confidence that can be placed in regional
  climate projections: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Analysis of surface air temperature and precipitation results from regional
    climate change experiments carried out with AOGCMs indicates that the biases
    in present-day simulations of regional climate change and the inter-model
    variability in the simulated regional changes are still too large to yield
    a high level of confidence in simulated change scenarios. The limited number
    of experiments available with statistical downscaling techniques and nested
    regional models has shown that complex topographical features, large lake
    systems, and narrow land masses not resolved at the resolution of current
    GCMs significantly affect the simulated regional and local change scenarios,
    both for precipitation and (to a lesser extent) temperature (IPCC, 1996).
    This adds a further degree of uncertainty in the use of GCM-produced scenarios
    for impact assessments. In addition, most climate change experiments have
    not accounted for human-induced landscape changes and only recently has the
    effect of aerosols been investigated. Both these factors can further affect
    projections of regional climate change." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wide range of projected changes in temperature and precipitation suggest
  that caution is required in treating any impact assessments based on GCM results
  as firm predictions. This uncertainty is why the term "climate scenarios" has
  been adopted in most impact assessments. Such scenarios should be regarded as
  internally consistent patterns of plausible future climates, not as predictions.
  Decisionmakers need to be aware of the uncertainties associated with climate
  projections so that they can weigh them in formulation of strategies to cope
  with the risks of climate change. </p>
<p>The review chapters in this report summarize impact
  studies based on a range of climate scenarios where they were available. Most
  studies were based on the older, mixed-layer GCM climate scenarios; results
  from coupled transient models have only recently become available, and studies
  using these scenarios are only beginning to be conducted. The older GCM runs
  estimate stable equilibrium conditions for 1xCO<sub>2</sub> and 2xCO<sub>2</sub> climates and generally
  show more global mean warming than recent transient model runs (see <a href="#table1-1">Table
  1-1</a> for a list of equilibrium scenarios used in studies assessed in this
  special report). In the transient model runs (see <a href="#table1-2">Table
  1-2</a> for a listing of transient scenarios cited), in which trace gases increase
  slowly over a period of years, the full effects of changes in temperature and
  precipitation lag the effects of changes in atmospheric composition by a number
  of decades. Thus, in impact studies using transient scenarios (e.g., model studies
  of potential climate change impacts on vegetation distribution), the positive
  effects of CO<sub>2</sub> on plant growth and other variables dependent upon plant production
  precede the full effects of changes in climate. </p>
<p>This complication does not mean that impact assessments based on older equilibrium
  GCM projections are of no value. Rather, it suggests that their results should
  be carefully interpreted. Where possible, the actual projected changes in temperature,
  precipitation, and so forth have been stated in the text, and climate scenarios
  representing the range of potential changes in temperature and precipitation
  have been used for regions where a range of scenarios is available. Space limitations
  prevent the presentation of fine detail, but the original source papers and
  reports are listed. Unfortunately, even some of the original material does not
  give as much precise information as might be desired. </p>
<p>At the very least, impact assessments based on older climate scenarios can
  be used to estimate the sensitivity of the various sectors to climate change.
  New transient GCMs based on improved coupling to the oceans; better scenarios
  of greenhouse gas and sulfate aerosol emissions; and better representation of
  processes of cloud formation, water vapor transport, ice/snow formation, vegetation
  feedbacks, and ocean circulation will produce quantitatively different results.
