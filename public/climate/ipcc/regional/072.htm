<h4>4.3.2.1. Hydrological Systems </h4>
<p>Hydrological systems are potentially very sensitive to changes in climate.
  The three key variables are soil moisture, which is a primary control on vegetation
  and ecosystems; groundwater recharge, which feeds groundwater reserves; and
  runoff, which feeds rivers and causes floods. Increased temperatures are expected
  to cause increased potential evaporation and less snow, and possible changes
  in mean rainfall, rainfall intensity, and rainfall seasonality would affect
  soil moisture, streamflow, and groundwater recharge and the occurrence of floods
  and droughts. More frequent high-intensity rainfall would tend to increase the
  occurrence of flooding. Specific effects will depend on the pattern of change,
  in rainfall particularly, and the characteristics of catchments and cannot be
  predicted with confidence. In general, the drier the climate, the greater the
  sensitivity to climate change (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 10). Although the effects
  of rainfall changes and sea-level rise on groundwater resources are not adequately
  understood at present, they cannot be ignored (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.3.6)
  and may be significant for inland and coastal aquifers in Australia (Ghassemi
  et al., 1991). </p>
<p>Water resources in the region are strongly affected by the heavy rainfall of
  major weather events, such as tropical cyclones in northern Australia, and by
  the ENSO phenomenon, which is the main source of year-to-year variation and
  contributes both widespread heavy rainfall and widespread drought, depending
  on its phase. However, climate models are unable to represent these well as
  yet and therefore cannot represent the resulting major sources of surface runoff
  and groundwater recharge events. This situation presents a basic difficulty
  in assessing climate change impacts on hydrological systems and water resources.
</p>
<p>A number of preliminary assessments and research studies of hydrological response
  in the region are available (e.g., Griffiths, 1990; Mosley, 1990; Bates et al.,
  1994; Chiew et al., 1995; Bates et al., 1996; Fitzharris and Garr, 1996; Minnery
  and Smith, 1996; Schreider et al., 1996). Most of the research work has been
  based on available regional scenarios of temperature and rainfall changes (see
  <a href="064.htm">Section 4.2.3</a>) and has focused on changes in water yield
  from unregulated rural catchments. Recent studies have begun to consider impacts
  on groundwater recharge (Green et al., 1997) and on water resources systems
  as a whole (Hassall and Associates, 1997; see <a href="068.htm#box4-1">Box 4-1</a>).
</p>
<p>A wide range of significant changes in water yield and soil moisture was found
  by Chiew et al. (1995), who considered the potential impacts of CSIRO (1992)
  climate scenarios on 28 catchments that represent the large range of climatic,
  physical, and hydrological regimes experienced in Australia. By 2030, increases
  in annual runoff of up to 25% and 10% occurred for catchments in the wet tropics
  of northeastern Australia and in Tasmania, respectively. Decreases of up to
  35% occurred for South Australia, and changes of �20% and � 50% occurred for
  southeastern Australia and the west coast, respectively. Changes in annual soil
  moisture levels ranged from -25% to +15%. Although the specific figures have
  high uncertainty (arising from the large scenario uncertainty), their magnitudes
  provide an indication of the size of changes that may conceivably occur. </p>
<p>Sizable changes in median monthly runoff during the wettest parts of the year
  and increases in annual maximum monthly runoff were found by Bates et al. (1996),
  who used the results of a single climate model (CSIRO9, experiment F1, <a href="003.htm#table1-1">Table
  1-1</a>) and a stochastic daily weather generator to represent climate and hydrological
  variability under current and doubled CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. The increases were due
  to the general increase in rainfall intensity and the increased frequency of
  heavy rainfall events indicated by the CSIRO9 model. </p>
<p>A similar shift toward greater variability was found by Schreider et al. (1996),
  who applied the "most wet" and "most dry" climate change scenarios for 2030
  and 2070 (adapted from CSIRO, 1992) to historical daily rainfall and temperature
  series for 14 rivers in the Ovens and Goulburn Basins in southeastern Australia.
  <a href="#figure4-2">Figure 4-2</a> shows that in scenarios in which rainfalls
  were projected to decrease ("most dry" scenario), the frequency of high-flow
  events substantially decreased, and the drought frequency (as indicated by a
  soil wetness index) increased. However, in scenarios in which rainfalls were
  projected to increase, there was little increase in average annual runoff, but
  the frequency of high flow events increased. <br>

      (bottom row), where rainfall increases and warmings are less, there is some
      increase in the highest runoffs but also some decreases in the highest soil
      wetness frequencies. For further details, see Schreider et al. (1996).</td>

  Changes in catchment vegetation-either from climate change directly or from
  adaptation responses (such as afforestation)-would alter catchment hydrological
  characteristics, including evaporation, runoff, and extreme events (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Sections 14.2, 14.4). The effects of changes in rainfall amount and timing
  on groundwater recharge can be amplified by the dynamic response of vegetation,
  according to a study by Green et al. (1997) that used a daily soil-vegetation-atmosphere
  model to determine changes in groundwater recharge beneath North Stradbroke
  Island in northeastern Australia. It was found that the net recharge increased
  consistently by amounts greater than the change in rainfall and that the recharge
  was more affected by vegetation type than by soil type. </p>
<p>The responses to climate change of the large, arid, ephemeral lake systems
  of interior Australia are difficult to predict. Significant water-level changes
  may occur for nonephemeral lakes in dry evaporative drainages or small basins
  where present evaporation is comparable with rainfall inputs (IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Section 10.3). </p>
<p>Rising sea levels will cause the tidal saltwater wedge to intrude further upstream
  in estuaries and rivers, with resulting changes in salinity affecting estuarine
  aquatic ecosystems (Chappell et al., 1996; Waterman, 1996). Similarly, sea-level
  rise also may lead to greater saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater,
  aquifers, and surface waters in some coastal systems (Ghassemi et al., 1991).
</p>
<p>Hydrological systems in the future also will be affected by other changes such
  as deforestation and urbanization, both of which tend to increase runoff amount
  and runoff speed-increasing the risks of flash flooding, high sediment loadings,
  and pollution. Changes to water pricing and allocation mechanisms also will
  affect patterns of water use and demand (Fenwick, 1995; McClintock, 1997), and
  indeed can be used as adaptation measures. </p>
