<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>All of the small island states considered in this report are located within
  the tropics, with the exception of Malta and Cyprus in the Mediterranean. About
  one-third of the states comprise a single main island; the others are made up
  of several or many islands. Although some states are experiencing relative declines
  in sea level, others-primarily low-lying island states and atolls-are especially
  vulnerable to climate change and associated sea-level rise because, in many
  cases (e.g., The Bahamas, Kiribati, Maldives, Marshall Islands), much of the
  land area is only 3-4 m above the present mean sea level. Islands at higher
  elevations also are vulnerable-particularly in coastal zones, where settlements,
  economic infrastructure, and vital services tend to be concentrated. </p>
<p><b>Regional Characteristics </b></p>
<p>The ocean exerts a strong influence on small islands. Island climate is moderated
  by the maritime influence-which, given the islands' mainly tropical location,
  results in uniformly high temperatures (20°C and above) throughout the year.
  However, other climate variables often exhibit distinct seasonal patterns-particularly
  rainfall distribution, which results in wet and dry seasons. Some small island
  states are subject to tropical cyclones (i.e., hurricanes or typhoons); those
  that are outside the main storm tracks also are affected by high seas and swells
  associated with such events. In the Pacific, large interannual rainfall variations
  resulting from the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon are an important
  climate characteristic; ENSO effects also are felt on islands in the Caribbean
  Sea and Indian Ocean. </p>
<p>Economic activities in small island states frequently are dominated by agriculture
  (e.g., sugar and bananas for export; subsistence farming for local consumption)
  and by tourism, both of which are sensitive to external forces and are strongly
  influenced by climatic factors. Fisheries, although largely artisanal, also
  support an important economic activity. Although total population numbers are
  low, settlements commonly are concentrated in the capital city or on the capital
  island, where population densities often are very high. Human demands on coastal
  and marine resources are continuing to increase; the potential impacts of climate
  change, added to these pressures, almost certainly will result in the degradation
  or loss of some natural ecosystems that are important to the economies of small
  island states. </p>
<p><b>Observed Climate Trends</b> </p>
<p>Caribbean islands experienced an increase in mean annual temperature of more
  than 0.5°C during the period 1900-1995. During the same period, mean annual
  total rainfall decreased by about 250 mm, though throughout the rainfall record
  has been characterized by large variability. In the Pacific islands, the increase
  in average annual temperature has been less than 0.5°C since 1900. Rainfall
  records for the Pacific (1900-1995) reveal no clear trend; they show decadal
  fluctuations of ±200 mm for mean annual rainfall and ±50-100 mm for seasonal
  rainfall. </p>
<p><b>Climate Model Projections</b> </p>
<p>Because simulations using ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (GCMs)
  are not presently conducted at fine horizontal resolution, the ability to generate
  climate change scenarios for the small island states is somewhat limited. However,
  because of the strong influence of the surrounding oceans on the climate of
  these islands and because the oceans are projected to warm in the future [1-2°C
  for the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, with a doubling
  of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)], small islands also are expected to experience moderate
  warming in the future. Mean rainfall intensity also is projected to increase
  by about 20-30% over the tropical oceans (the main locations of the small island
  states) with doubled CO<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, simulations conducted with combined
  greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol forcings project a decrease in mean summer
  precipitation over the Mediterranean Sea region (the location of Malta and Cyprus).
</p>
<p>At this stage, there is much uncertainty in climate model projections with
  respect to possible changes in the distribution, frequency, and intensity of
  tropical cyclones and ENSO events. The most significant climate-related projection
  for small islands is sea-level rise. Current estimates of future global sea-level
  rise of 5 mm/yr (with a range of 2-9 mm/yr) represent a rate that is 2 to 4
  times higher than what has been experienced globally over the past 100 years.
  Considerable local and regional variations in the rate, magnitude, and direction
  of sea-level change can be expected as a result of thermal expansion, tectonic
  movements, and changes in ocean circulation. However, although the level of
  vulnerability will vary from island to island, it is expected that practically
  all small island states will be adversely affected by sea-level rise. </p>
