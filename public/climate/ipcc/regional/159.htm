<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Most semi-arid lands in the region are classified as rangelands, with a cover
  of grassland or shrubland. Moister areas are covered mostly by woodlands; the
  few forested areas account for only 5% of the land area in the region. Together,
  these areas represent 1% of the world's woodlands/forests (see <a href="156.htm#table7-1">Table
  7-1</a>). The region's forests and woodlands nevertheless are important resources
  that will have to be safeguarded, given the heavy use of wood as fuel in some
  countries. </p>
<p>Many desert organisms already are near their limits of temperature tolerance,
  and some may not be able to persist under hotter conditions. Because of the
  current marginality of soil-water and nutrient reserves, some ecosystems in
  semi-arid regions may be among the first to show the effects of climate change
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 4). Higher temperatures in arid regions that experience
  cold winters are likely to allow spring growth to begin earlier. In some cases,
  this effect may result in earlier depletion of water reserves accumulated over
  the cooler winter period-leading to an even longer period of potential drought
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 3) and a potential reduction in animal productivity,
  including wool production. </p>
<p>The influence of climate change on large-scale events, such as wildfires, can
  be inferred only indirectly. However, some authors have suggested that an increase
  in climate variability may increase the frequency and severity of wildfires
  in grasslands and rangelands (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 2). Even without an
  increase in climate variability, fire frequencies may increase in some areas
  as a result of warmer weather. Fires may further reduce local precipitation
  because fire-emitted aerosols increase the number of cloud condensation nuclei,
  producing smaller cloud droplets that are less likely to fall as rain (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 1.4.2). </p>
<p>In arid and semi-arid rangelands, annual net primary productivity is strongly
  influenced by fire and climate. Fires alter the structure of vegetation and
  affect nutrient cycling. By making nitrogen and other nutrients more available
  to soil microorganisms, fire may result in enhanced emissions of nitrous oxide
  (N<sub>2</sub>O) from soil. Most of these emissions are short-term effects that occur immediately
  following the fire (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 2). Parts of the region that become
  subject to more frequent fires also could suffer long-term effects, such as
  decreases in soil organic matter, changes in species composition, and long-term
  losses of nitrogen through volatilization (i.e., loss to the atmosphere during
  the fire) and immobilization (as very stable compounds in the soil). These effects
  would exacerbate any nitrogen limitation, which often is a factor in arid and
  semi-arid areas (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 2). </p>
<p>The MAPSS and BIOME3 models of vegetation cover classify the region as arid
  lands dominated by shrub/woodland/ grasslands; these models project little change
  in cover under the climate scenarios used (see <a href="320.htm">Figure C-1</a>),
  although they project a 1-10% decrease in leaf area index (see <a href="320.htm#figureC-4">Figure
  C-4</a>). However, these models-which are based on a simple matching of vegetation
  to climate-are unable to take into account many of the more complex interactions
  described above. </p>
<p>A vulnerability assessment of the productivity of semi-desert rangelands in
  the Aral Sea region shows that this region is very sensitive to changes in precipitation.
  Under a temperature increase of 2�C and a precipitation increase of 0.2-0.3
  mm/day, grassland productivity is projected to increase by 20-55%. Under a temperature
  increase of 0.5�C and reduced precipitation, however, productivity could be
  reduced by 6-32%; temperature increases of 2-3�C, combined with reduced precipitation,
  could reduce grassland productivity by 40-90% (Smith et al., 1996). </p>
