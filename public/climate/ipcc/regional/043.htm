<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p><b>Main Points</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Arctic is extremely vulnerable to projected climate change and its impacts.
    Over the period of this assessment, climate change is expected to contribute
    to major physical, ecological, sociological, and economic changes already
    begun in the Arctic. Because of a variety of positive feedback mechanisms,
    the Arctic is likely to respond to climate change rapidly and more severely
    than any other area on earth. The most direct and pronounced changes to the
    Arctic are likely to include changes in temperature and precipitation, with
    subsequent effects on sea ice and permafrost. Much smaller changes are likely
    for the Antarctic over the period of this assessment. The Antarctic is likely
    to respond relatively slowly to climate change. </li>
  <li>Substantial loss of sea ice is expected in the Arctic Ocean. If there is
    more open water, there will be impacts on the climate system of northern countries
    as temperatures moderate and precipitation increases. If warming occurs, there
    will be considerable thawing of permafrost-leading to changes in drainage,
    increased slumping, and altered landscapes over large areas. </li>
  <li>Polar warming probably should increase biological production but may lead
    to different species composition on land and in the sea. On land, there will
    be a tendency for poleward shifts in major biomes and associated animals.
    However, the Arctic Ocean geographically limits movement of the tundra, taiga,
    and boreal forest. In the sea, marine ecosystems will move poleward. Animals
    dependent on ice may be disadvantaged. </li>
  <li> Changes in the polar climate are likely to affect the rest of the world
    through increased sea levels from melting of the cryosphere, increased warming
    of lower latitudes from slowing of oceanic transport of heat, and increased
    greenhouse gas levels through carbon dioxide and methane emissions in the
    Arctic. </li>
  <li>Human communities in the Arctic will be affected by these physical and ecological
    changes. The effects will be particularly important for indigenous peoples
    leading traditional lifestyles.</li>
  <li> There will be economic benefits and costs. Benefits include new opportunities
    for shipping across the Arctic Ocean, lower operational costs for the oil
    and gas industry, lower heating costs, and easier access for tourism. Increased
    costs can be expected from several sources, including disruptions caused by
    thawing of permafrost and reduced transportation capabilities across frozen
    ground and water. Sea-ice changes in the Arctic have major strategic implications
    for trade and defense. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Document Summary</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Regional Climate</b>. Cold is the overwhelming characteristic of polar
    regions, with nine months of snow, ice, cold, and relative darkness. In the
    Arctic, there are only a few weeks of thaw, when much of the ground is boggy
    and awash with water. There also are episodes of extreme cold and storms.
    In Antarctica, temperatures mostly remain below freezing.</li>
  <li><b>Climate Trends</b>. Parts of the Arctic and Antarctic have warmed over
    the past half-century, while some parts appear to have cooled. Precipitation
    seems higher. Trends in the overall ice balance of the world's major ice sheets
    in Greenland and Antarctica are uncertain. There is conflicting information
    on changes in the thickness and extent of sea ice globally. Ice seems to be
    thinning in the Arctic but not in the Antarctic. </li>
  <li><b>Vulnerability and Impacts</b>. Systems in the Arctic and Antarctic Peninsula
    are extremely sensitive to temperature. The primary impacts will be on the
    physical environment, biota and ecosystems, and human activities. The Arctic
    Ocean has strong sensitivity to temperature because its exposed areal extent
    grows and shrinks by as much as 50% within a single year. Interannual variability
    in sea ice similarly shows extreme sensitivity to temperature. The Arctic
    terrestrial system, primarily based on permafrost, also is very sensitive
    to temperature because much of the permafrost is currently discontinuous.
    Strong positive feedback mechanisms within the Arctic suggest that climate
    change is likely to be more severe in the Arctic than in the rest of the world.</li>
  <li><b>Terrestrial Ecological Systems</b>. Climate change may occur at a rapid
    rate relative to forest migration ability. If there is warming, there will
    be a poleward migration of the northern treeline. However, geographic limitations
    may restrict the migration of the boreal forest. If warming occurs and the
    forest cover changes, there will be major impacts on biological resources
    (e.g., bears, caribou, small mammals, amphibians, and insects). The effects
    of climate change have not been deeply investigated in the Antarctic terrestrial
    ecosystem, but its distribution and specific composition could be altered
    by global warming. </li>
  <li><b>Marine Ecological Systems</b>. In general, productivity should rise.
    Warming should increase growth and development rates of nonmammals; however,
    ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation is still increasing, which may constrain primary
    productivity as well as fish productivity. Additional risks include the loss
    of sea-ice cover, upon which several marine mammals depend for food and protection.
    Also, Arctic shipping, oil exploration and transport, and economic development
    could bring risks to many species. </li>
  <li><b>Additional Stressors</b>. In addition to climatically driven changes,
    such as changes in sea ice and temperature, the Arctic currently is stressed
    from a variety of sources, and some of these stresses are likely to increase
    in the next few decades. Additional stresses that may confound the effects
    of climate change include hydrocarbons, radionuclides, acidification, heavy
    metals, persistent organic pollutants, and UV radiation, as well as increased
    human development, traffic, and potential oil spills.</li>
  <li><b>Ice</b>. If there is warming, the Arctic Ocean, as well as Arctic lakes
    and streams, could experience a thinner and reduced ice cover. In contrast,
    vast Antarctica is so cold that any warming within the IPCC scenarios should
    have little impact except in the Dry Valleys and on the Antarctic Peninsula.
    In fact, ice could accumulate through greater snowfall, slowing sea-level
    rise. </li>
  <li><b>Permafrost</b>. Permafrost covers all of Antarctica and most of the Arctic.
    Much of the Arctic permafrost is close to thawing, making it an area extremely
    sensitive to even small changes in temperature. Effects of thawing permafrost
    include large-scale slumping, erosion, and sinking of areas. All of these
    effects will disrupt current vegetation, ecosystems, water balance, and human
    structures. </li>
  <li><b>Fisheries</b>. Warming could lead to a rise in production unless changes
    in water properties would disrupt the spawning grounds of fish in high latitudes.
    There could be a substantial redistribution of important fish species. Fisheries
    on the margin of profitability could prosper or decline. Fishing seasons will
    lengthen, but most stocks already are fully exploited. </li>
  <li><b>Navigation and Transport</b>. If sea-ice coverage is reduced, coastal
    and river navigation will increase. Opportunities for water transport, tourism,
    and trade will increase. The Arctic Ocean could become a major trade route.
    Seasonal transport across once-frozen land and rivers may become more difficult
    or costly. Offshore oil production should benefit from less ice. </li>
  <li><b>Sub-Antarctic Islands</b>. These small, isolated, usually uninhabited
    islands in the Southern Ocean have specialized flora and important marine
    mammals and birds. Many seem to have warmed over the past 50 years, and this
    trend is expected to continue. Climate change impacts are unlikely to be important
    for most animal and bird species, but plant communities could change. Glaciers
    will probably shrink. </li>
  <li><b>Arctic Settlements</b>. If the climate ameliorates, conditions will favor
    the northward spread of agriculture, forestry, and mining, with an expansion
    of population and settlements. More infrastructure-such as marine, road, rail,
    and air links-would be required. Changes in the distribution and abundance
    of sea and land animals will impact on traditional lifestyles of native communities.
  </li>
  <li><b>Infrastructure</b>. If the permafrost thaws, much infrastructure-including
    pipelines, airstrips, water supply and sewage systems, building foundations,
    roads, rail lines, and mining systems and structures-will be damaged. Thawing
    could disrupt petroleum production in the tundra. Redesign and replacement
    of many of these systems will be needed. </li>
  <li><b>Integrated Analysis</b>. Direct effects could include ecosystem shifts,
    sea- and river-ice loss, and permafrost thaw. Indirect effects could include
    positive feedback to the climate system. There will be new challenges and
    opportunities for shipping, the oil industry, fishing, mining, tourism, infrastructure,
    and the movement of populations, resulting in more interactions and changes
    in trade and strategic balance. There will be winners and losers. As examples,
    a reduced and thinning ice cover will disadvantage polar bears, while sea
    otters will have new habitats; communities on new shipping routes will grow,
    while those built on permafrost will have difficulties. Native communities
    will face profound changes impacting on traditional lifestyles. </li>
