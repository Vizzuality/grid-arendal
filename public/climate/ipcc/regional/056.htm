<h1>3.4. Integrated Analysis of Potential Vulnerabilities and Impacts and Future
  Research Needs </h1>
<p>Individual sectors and resources will not be affected in isolation but in interaction
  with one another. The direct effects of climate change include shifts in geographic
  distribution of ecosystems, changes in sea and river ice, thaw of permafrost,
  and changes in coastal areas. Indirect effects include feedbacks to the climate
  system through less ice and snow reflectivity, changes in sea ice and ocean
  circulation, and ecological sources and sinks of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. Improvements are
  needed in modeling of future sea-ice distribution and thickness because of their
  importance as drivers for other physical and ecological systems, economics,
  and transportation. There is uncertainty about whether changes in tundra will
  cause it to act as a source or a sink for CO<sub>2</sub>. This issue needs to be resolved.
</p>
<p>There is a variety of positive and negative shifts in opportunities for shipping,
  the oil industry, fishing, mining, and tourism, as well as coastal infrastructure
  and the movement of populations. These impacts will lead to further interactions
  and potential changes in trade and strategic balance. The health consequences
  of these shifts will depend on human capacity to adapt. </p>
<p>The Arctic is more vulnerable than the Antarctic because of its sensitive and
  fragile ecosystems and the impacts on traditional lifestyles of indigenous peoples
  and because climate changes are expected to be greater. An integrated impact
  assessment using multiple stress models is required for the Arctic. When associated
  with baseline monitoring, it should be possible to distinguish natural variability
  from human impacts. </p>
<p>Further analysis should focus on particularly sensitive zones and activities,
  vulnerable species, marginal communities, and estimates of economic impacts.
  To improve biological components of regional and global models, it is important
  to understand how, when, and where productivity in the Southern Ocean will change
  with global warming (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 8.3.2). More certainty is required
  regarding the future behavior of the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet and
  ice balance of the continent. Changes have the potential to substantially alter
  sea level and southern hemispheric climate, but the time frame needs to be defined.
</p>
<p>Most human and natural systems in the Arctic and the Antarctic Peninsula are
  extremely sensitive to temperature. Future global warming is expected to be
  greatest in these areas. Large reductions in sea ice, permafrost, and tundra
  will disrupt many natural systems and change species composition over land and
  in the polar oceans. These areas appear to be vulnerable to climate change,
  although the number of people directly affected would be relatively small. However,
  most are indigenous people, who lead traditional lifestyles and have few adaptive
  strategies that can be implemented. Antarctica is less vulnerable because the
  temperature changes envisioned over the next century are likely to have little
  impact, and few people are involved. </p>
