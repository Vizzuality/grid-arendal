<p><i>Aquaculture potential will be affected by projected changes in climate and
  climate variability and could take advantage of extended favorable conditions
  in currently marginal areas.</i> </p>
<p>Most of the recent growth in total fisheries production is from aquaculture,
  which has grown rapidly during the past few decades and accounts for about 10%
  of total world fish production-mostly of higher-valued products. Aquaculture
  contributes to the resiliency of the fisheries industry, tending to stabilize
  supply and prices. Advancements are unevenly distributed across regions, farming
  systems, and communities. Growth in the United States is about 5% annually.
  The marine component is growing rapidly, but freshwater aquaculture is still
  dominant. Aquaculture will not rapidly solve the scarcity of natural fish, and
  current industry growth will fulfill the demand only for certain commodities,
  regions, and consumer groups. </p>
<p>Genetic engineering holds great promise to increase the production and efficiency
  of fish farming (Fischetti, 1991). However, fishers and resource managers are
  very concerned about accidental or intentional release of altered and introduced
  species that might harm natural stocks and gene pools. Around Scandinavia, escapees
  and nonindigenous reproduction may have reached or exceeded the recruitment
  of salmon wild stocks (Ackefors et al., 1991). Other concerns associated with
  aquaculture are the discharge of excess nutrients into surrounding waters that
  can add to eutrophication; the heavy use of antibiotics and contamination with
  pesticides, potentially leading to disease outbreaks; and the introduction of
  pathogenic organisms and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. </p>
<p>Ranching (in which young fish are released to feed and mature at sea) and fish
  farming, like their equivalents on land, have self-generated and imposed impediments
  to success. The activities can compete for coastal space with other uses, and
  continued expansion can jeopardize the quality and quantity of fish habitat
  (e.g., through loss of mangroves and wetlands, competition for food with wild
  stocks, or other factors) (NCC, 1989). </p>
<p>Climate variability is important to aquaculture. Decreasing temperatures may
  cause low minimum temperatures through the year-possibly causing mass mortalities,
  especially along the east coast. Long-term temperature trends will affect what
  species of fish or shellfish are suitable, as well as the expansion or contraction
  of suitable aquaculture sites. General warming may allow aquaculture sites to
  expand into regions previously unavailable because water temperatures were too
  cold or there was a presence of sea ice. Growth rates of fish or shellfish and
  their food requirements are temperature dependent. Aquaculturists also are interested
  in projections of wind mixing, which contributes to flushing (i.e., the exchange
  of water between the aquaculture site and surrounding waters). Low flushing
  can lead to decreased oxygen; greater potential for the spread of diseases;
  and, in the case of filter feeders such as mussels, reduced food availability.
</p>
<p><i>The survival, health, migration, and distribution of many North American
  marine mammals and sea turtles are expected to be impacted by projected changes
  in the climate through impacts on their food supply, sea-ice extent, and breeding
  habitats. </i></p>
<p>In North American waters, approximately 125 extant species of marine mammals
  (e.g., whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions, polar bears, and marine otters) are
  known to occur at least some time during the year. Although reliable abundance
  estimates for these mammals in North America are limited, there are endangered
  or threatened species among these mammals (e.g., 28 species are listed as either
  endangered or threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act or depleted under
  the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act); many are recovering from commercial
  harvesting and overexploitation. </p>
<p>Many marine mammals (e.g., the great whales) are able to locate and follow
  seasonal centers of food production, which frequently change from year to year
  depending on local oceanographic conditions. Similarly, their migrations may
  change to accommodate interannual differences in environmental conditions. However,
  some marine mammals (e.g., seals and sea lions) have life histories that tie
  them to specific geographic features (e.g., pupping beaches or icefields). Although
  there is some flexibility in their need for specific habitats, some marine mammals
  may be more severely affected than others by changes in the availability of
  necessary habitats and prey species that result from climate change. </p>
