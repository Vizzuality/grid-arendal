<p>The values represented very small percentage changes in total agriculture value
  (< 3% of the value of the base model solution). As a result, in the aggregate,
  Adams et al. (1995b) concluded that climate appears to be a relatively small
  stress to agriculture in the United States. Welfare losses from adverse climate
  change also tended to be smaller than previous estimates, whereas gains from
  favorable climate change tend to be larger because of the more comprehensive
  treatment of adjustment possibilities such as the inclusion of new crops and
  migration possibilities that were used in the analysis. This study concludes,
  as others have, that climate change of the type evaluated does not appear to
  be a food security issue for the United States (Adams et al., 1995b). On the
  other hand, this study did not incorporate the costs of adaptations or the consequences
  of changes in subregional agricultural production for the economies of those
  subregions; it only addressed the consequences of change in mean climate, without
  increased climate variability; and it did not evaluate the possible consequences
  of potential secondary effects on pests, pathogens, or soils that might result
  from climate change. These shortcomings represent important research needs with
  regard to integrated modeling of climate change impacts for the agricultural
  sector. </p>
<p>Sensitivity analyses performed in conjunction with the Adams et al. (1995b)
  analyses indicated that potential farmer adaptations to climate change can play
  a major role in mitigating adverse effects of climate change, suggesting the
  importance of technology and related assumptions in future analyses. Sensitivity
  analyses of export assumptions reinforced the importance of world trade (exports)
  on the welfare of the U.S. agricultural sector. Global climate change is likely
  to increase the demand for U.S. commodities, with possible increases in welfare.
  Because of the importance of North American agriculture to world food production,
  trade issues are an important interregional consideration. </p>
<p>When the GCM-based analyses were considered, climate changes according to the
  GISS forecasts led to net welfare increases of $12 billion for the 1990 base-approximately
  20% larger than previous analyses of GISS climate change using the Agriculture
  Sector Model (Adams et al., 1995b). The increase was related primarily to changes
  in the model allowing other mitigation activities that permit the agricultural
  sector to exploit more fully new climate conditions. The GFDL-R30 analysis revealed
  losses of more than $14 billion (measured against the 1990 base). These losses
  arise from harsher climate conditions under the GCM. Results from the GCM cases
  did not compare well with estimates generated by response functions resulting
  from the uniform change scenarios, indicating the importance of regional differences
  in climate as determinants of estimates of national economic consequences. </p>
<p><i>Several global climate change scenarios imply modest improvements in the
  agroclimatic potential for high-latitude agriculture in North America. </i></p>
<p>Recent studies (Mills, 1994; Brklacich et al., 1996, 1997a) have investigated
  the extent to which global climate change might shift the frontier for Canadian
  agriculture northward. About 1.2 million ha in the Peace River region of northern
  Alberta and British Columbia currently are devoted to spring-seeded cereals,
  forages, and pasture crops. Soils capable of supporting agricultural production
  north of the Peace River region (i.e., above 58�N latitude) are abundant, but
  these regions currently are too cool and too remote from markets. </p>
<p>Climate change scenarios derived from the GFDL and CCC 2xCO<sub>2</sub> models were estimated
  to relax current constraints imposed by short, cool, frost-free seasons. However,
  it also was estimated that these benefits would be offset somewhat by declines
  in summer precipitation, with concomitant increases in crop moisture deficits
  (most notably under the CCC scenario). </p>
<p>The CERES-Wheat model was used to estimate the combined effects of increasing
  CO<sub>2</sub> levels to 555 ppm and the GFDL and CCC climatic change scenarios on spring
  wheat yields. Under the GFDL scenario, modest increases in spring-seeded wheat
  yields were estimated. Increases in crop moisture stress under the CCC scenario
  were estimated to offset the benefits of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels and longer, warmer,
  frost-free seasons; overall, modest declines in spring wheat yields were estimated.
</p>
<p>Winter temperature increases were estimated at 3-4�C and 4�C under the GFDL
  and CCC scenarios, respectively. Assessments using CERES-Wheat indicated that
  these temperature increases would be sufficient to support winter wheat production
  at several locations within the Peace River region. It was also estimated that,
  for lands north of the Peace River region (i.e., north of the current climatic
  frontier for commercial agriculture), these temperature increases would not
  be sufficient to remove the risk of winter crop damage. In these northern prairie
  regions, soil capability to sustainably support agriculture may become more
  limiting than temperature. </p>
<p>Development of the capability to simulate the agricultural impacts of multiple
  transient climate scenarios is a research need that must be met to deal credibly
  with the cost of adaptation, about which there is significant uncertainty. Socioeconomic
  adjustment must be modeled to treat key dynamic processes-such as how the expectations
  of farmers change; whether farmers can easily detect climate change against
  a background of high natural variability; and how current investments in equipment,
  education, and training will affect the costs of adjustment. </p>
