<h4>2.2.1. African Climate Trends and Projections</h4>
<p>Temperature and precipitation trends are reviewed in <a href="305.htm">Annex
  A</a> of this report. Rainfall trends-especially over the past 30 years or so-have
  had a very large bearing on socioeconomic development of the continent because
  most activities are agriculturally based (Serageldin, 1995). </p>
<p>Uncertainties in GCMs make deriving regional climate change predictions impossible
  (see <a href="306.htm">Annex
  B</a> of this report for an assessment of regional
  projections of climate change). Therefore, it is important to interpret model
  outputs in the context of their uncertainties and to consider them as potential
  scenarios of change for use in sensitivity and vulnerability studies. In IPCC
  (1990), IPCC (1996), and Hernes et al. (1995), the Sahel (10-20°N, 20-40°E)
  was selected as a study region for purposes of inter-comparing GCM outputs.
  Since then, several approaches to subregional climate projection have been developed
  at national levels (e.g., Joubert, 1995; Ringius et al., 1996); several others
  have been developed under the U.S. Country Studies Program (USCSP, 1996). </p>
<p>Although most initial climate change simulations used GCMs, an increasing number
  of climate-modeling centers have used regional climate models (RCMs). RCMs rely
  on similar physical representations of atmospheric processes as GCMs but operate
  at a much finer spatial resolution-typically 50 km-over limited domains. Little
  climate change work using RCMs nested within GCMs has been completed as yet
  for Africa (Ringius et al., 1996), so it remains necessary to rely on extracting
  regional results for Africa from GCM climate change experiments. A selection
  of such results is summarized in <a href="011.htm#box2-3">Box 2-3</a>. <br>

	    <p>With respect to temperature, land areas may warm by 2050 by as much
	  as 1.6°C over the Sahara and semi-arid parts of southern Africa (Hernes
	  et al., 1995; Ringius et al., 1996). Equatorial countries (Cameroon,
	  Uganda, and Kenya) might be about 1.4°C warmer. This projection represents
	  a rate of warming to 2050 of about 0.2°C per decade. Sea-surface temperatures
	  in the open tropical oceans surrounding Africa will rise by less than
	  the global average (i.e., only about 0.6-0.8°C); the coastal regions
	  of the continent therefore will warm more slowly than the continental
	  interior. </p>
        <p>Rainfall changes projected by most GCMs are relatively modest, at least
	  in relation to present-day rainfall variability. In general, rainfall
	  is projected to increase over the continent-the exceptions being southern
	  Africa and parts of the Horn of Africa; here, rainfall is projected
	  to decline by 2050 by about 10%. Seasonal changes in rainfall are not
	  expected to be large; Joubert and Tyson (1996) found no evidence for
	  a change in rainfall seasonality among a selection of mixed-layer and
	  fully coupled GCMs. Hewitson and Crane (1996) found evidence for slightly
	  extended later summer season rainfall over eastern South Africa (though
	  nowhere else), based on a single mixed-layer model prediction. Great
	  uncertainty exists, however, in relation to regional-scale rainfall
	  changes simulated by GCMs (Joubert and Hewitson, 1997). Parts of the
	  Sahel could experience rainfall increases of as much as 15% over the
	  1961-90 average. Equatorial Africa could experience a small (5%) increase
	  in rainfall. These rainfall results are not consistent: Different climate
	  models, or different simulations with the same model, yield different
	  patterns. The problem involves determining the character of the climate
	  change signal on African rainfall against a background of large natural
	  variability compounded by the use of imperfect climate models. </p>
        <p>Projected temperature increases are likely to lead to increased open
	  water and soil/plant evaporation. Exactly how large this increased evaporative
	  loss will be would depend on factors such as physiological changes in
	  plant biology, atmospheric circulation, and land-use patterns. As a
	  rough estimate, potential evapotranspiration over Africa is projected
	  to increase by 5-10% by 2050. Little can be said yet about changes in
	  climate variability or extreme events in Africa. Rainfall may well become
	  more intense, but whether there will be more tropical cyclones or a
	  changed frequency of El Niño events remains largely in the realm of
	  speculation. </p>
        <p>Changes in sea level and climate in Africa might be expected by the
	  year 2050. Hernes et al. (1995) project a sea-level rise of about 25
	  cm. There will be subregional and local differences around the coast
	  of Africa in this average sea-level rise-depending on ocean currents,
	  atmospheric pressure, and natural land movements-but 25 cm by 2050 is
	  a generally accepted figure (Joubert and Tyson, 1996). For Africa south
	  of the Equator, simulated changes in mean sea-level pressure produced
	  by mixed-layer and fully coupled GCMs are small (~1 hPa)-smaller than
	  present-day simulation errors calculated for both types of models (Joubert
	  and Tyson, 1996). Observed sea-level pressure anomalies of the same
	  magnitude as simulated changes are known to accompany major large-scale
	  circulation adjustments associated with extended wet and dry spells
	  over the subcontinent.</p>
