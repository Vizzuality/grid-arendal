<h4>8.3.9.3. Extreme Weather Events </h4>
<p>In the United States, 145 natural disasters resulted in 14,536 deaths from
  1945 to 1989. Of these events, 136 were weather disasters; these extreme weather
  events caused 95% of all disaster-related deaths. Floods are the most frequent
  type of disaster. </p>
<p>More frequent extreme weather events are predicted to accompany global warming
  (see <a href="#figure8-10">Figure 8-10</a>), in part as a consequence of projected
  increases in convective activity. More intense rainfall events accompanying
  global warming would be expected to increase the occurrence of floods, and warmer
  sea-surface temperatures could strengthen tropical cyclones (IPCC 1996, WG I).

      growth, nor do they fully account for air-conditioning use; however, they

  Climate models are unable to predict extreme events because they lack spatial
  and temporal resolution. In addition, there is no clear evidence that sustained
  or worldwide changes in extreme events have occurred in the past few decades.
  Nonetheless, such events cause loss of life and endanger health by increasing
  injuries, infectious diseases, stress-related disorders, and adverse health
  effects associated with social and environmental disruptions and environmentally
  enforced migration. Because each extreme weather event is unique in scale and
  location, and population vulnerability varies considerably, it is not possible
  to quantify the health impacts that would be associated with potential changes
  in extreme weather events. </p>
<p>Recent floods in the United States (e.g., Mississippi River flooding in 1993)
  were caused primarily by unusually high precipitation combined with soil saturation
  from earlier precipitation (Kunkel et al., 1994). In the United States, flash
  floods currently are the leading cause of weather-related mortality. In addition
  to causing deaths by drowning, flooding can lead to widespread destruction of
  food supplies and outbreaks of disease as a result of breakdowns in sanitation
  services. Flooding also may result in the release of dangerous chemicals from
  storage sites and waste disposal sites into floodwaters. Increased runoff from
  agricultural lands during periods of heavy precipitation also can threaten water
  supplies. The 1993 Mississippi River flooding, for example, caused wide dispersal
  of microorganisms and chemicals from agricultural lands and industrial sites
  (Changnon, 1996). </p>
