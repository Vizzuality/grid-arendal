<h1>Polar Regions: The Arctic and the Antarctic</h1>
<p>The polar regions include some very diverse landscapes, and the Arctic and
  the Antarctic are very different in character. The Arctic is defined here as
  the area within the Arctic Circle; the Antarctic here includes the area within
  the Antarctic Convergence, including the Antarctic continent, the Southern Ocean,
  and the sub-Antarctic islands. The Arctic can be described as a frozen ocean
  surrounded by land, and the Antarctic as a frozen continent surrounded by ocean.
  The projected warming in the polar regions is greater than for many other regions
  of the world. Where temperatures are close to freezing on average, global warming
  will reduce land ice and sea ice, the former contributing to sea-level rise.
  However, in the interiors of ice caps, increased temperature may not be sufficient
  to lead to melting of ice and snow, and will tend to have the effect of increasing
  snow accumulation. </p>
<p><i>Ecosystems</i>: Major physical and ecological changes are expected in the
  Arctic. Frozen areas close to the freezing point will thaw and undergo substantial
  changes with warming. Substantial loss of sea ice is expected in the Arctic
  Ocean. As warming occurs, there will be considerable thawing of permafrost-leading
  to changes in drainage, increased slumping, and altered landscapes over large
  areas. Polar warming probably will increase biological production but may lead
  to different species composition on land and in the sea. On land, there will
  be a tendency for polar shifts in major biomes such as tundra and boreal forest
  and associated animals, with significant impacts on species such as bear and
  caribou. However, the Arctic Ocean geographically limits northward movement.
  Much smaller changes are likely for the Antarctic, but there may be species
  shifts. In the sea, marine ecosystems will move poleward. Animals dependent
  on ice may be disadvantaged in both polar areas. </p>
<p><i>Hydrology and Water Resources</i>: Increasing temperature will thaw permafrost
  and melt more snow and ice. There will be more running and standing water. Drainage
  systems in the Arctic are likely to change at the local scale. River and lake
  ice will break up earlier and freeze later. </p>
<p><i>Food and Fiber Production</i>: Agriculture is severely limited by the harsh
  climate. Many limitations will remain in the future, though some small northern
  extension of farming into the Arctic may be possible. In general, marine ecological
  productivity should rise. Warming should increase growth and development rates
  of nonmammals; ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation is still increasing, however,
  which may adversely affect primary productivity as well as fish productivity.
</p>
<p><i>Coastal Systems</i>: As warming occurs, the Arctic could experience a thinner
  and reduced ice cover. Coastal and river navigation will increase, with new
  opportunities for water transport, tourism, and trade. The Arctic Ocean could
  become a major global trade route. Reductions in ice will benefit offshore oil
  production. Increased erosion of Arctic shorelines is expected from a combination
  of rising sea level, permafrost thaw, and increased wave action as a result
  of increased open water. Further breakup of ice shelves in the Antarctic peninsula
  is likely. Elsewhere in Antarctica, little change is expected in coastlines
  and probably in its large ice shelves. </p>
<p><i>Human Settlements</i>: Human communities in the Arctic will be substantially
  affected by the projected physical and ecological changes. The effects will
  be particularly important for indigenous peoples leading traditional lifestyles.
  There will be new opportunities for shipping, the oil industry, fishing, mining,
  tourism, and migration of people. Sea ice changes projected for the Arctic have
  major strategic implications for trade, especially between Asia and Europe.
</p>
<p><i>Conclusions</i>: The Antarctic peninsula and the Arctic are very vulnerable
  to projected climate change and its impacts. Although the number of people directly
  affected is relatively small, many native communities will face profound changes
  that impact on traditional lifestyles. Direct effects could include ecosystem
  shifts, sea- and river-ice loss, and permafrost thaw. Indirect effects could
  include feedbacks to the climate system such as further releases of greenhouse
  gases, changes in ocean circulation drivers, and increased temperature and higher
  precipitation with loss of ice, which could affect climate and sea level globally.
  The interior of Antarctica is less vulnerable to climate change, because the
  temperature changes envisaged over the next century are likely to have little
  impact and very few people are involved. However, there are considerable uncertainties
  about the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheets and the future behavior of
  the West Antarctic ice sheet (low probability of disintegration over the next
  century). Changes in either could affect sea level and Southern Hemisphere climates.
