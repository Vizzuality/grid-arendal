<h4>4.3.2.2. Water Hazards and Water Supply </h4>
<p>If rainfall becomes more extreme, flooding, landslides, and erosion would become
  greater and/or more frequent (Fowler and Hennessy, 1995; IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections
  4.2, 12.4). Locations most at risk include steep or unstable hill country, river
  valleys, and floodplains. Most of the region's settlements are adjacent to rivers
  and harbors. Furthermore, in low-lying coastal areas, sea-level rise will compound
  the problem by reducing river flood discharge rates and thus exacerbate flood
  heights and durations. </p>
<p>Where urban areas are exposed to flood risk, either directly or through failure
  of upstream river management works, the potential human and infrastructural
  vulnerability is extreme and has significant financial implications. Major costs
  to dam owners and public agencies would arise from any upward revision of Probable
  Maximum Flood estimates. The costs to private property and public buildings
  and infrastructure of floods under the existing climate are already high; for
  example, the damage caused by the 1974 floods in Brisbane was reported to be
  A$660 million (Minnery and Smith, 1996). A study by these authors of the Hawkesbury-Nepean
  corridor, an urban area near Sydney, estimated that the potential damage from
  the "100-year" flood rose more than tenfold for a doubled CO<sub>2</sub> scenario in which
  the flood return periods decreased by a factor of four (<a href="#table4-1">Table
  4-1</a>). <br>

  Climate change is expected to affect water demand, water supply, and water
  quality (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 14.2, 14.3). For many parts of the region,
  rainfall and water supply are generally adequate. However, the drier inland
  areas of Australia are vulnerable to potential water shortages during the seasonal
  minimum and during droughts; any additional shortages in these regions arising
  from climate change would sharpen competition among various economic, social,
  and environmental uses and hence increase the effective cost of water. Considerable
  demand arises from urbanization and the diversion of large amounts of water
  for economic purposes such as mining and irrigated agriculture. This competition
  may be exacerbated by trends toward population growth, higher valuation of natural
  waters, and possibly shifts to more intensive farming systems. If, on the other
  hand, there were an increase in water availability due to climate change, it
  might well encourage demand for more irrigation, with obvious short-term benefits-although
  in the longer-term this could lead to increased salinization in semi-arid regions.
</p>
<p>In central Australia, low rainfall and high evaporation forces the few towns-such
  as Alice Springs and Yulara-and other tourist centers, cattle stations (ranches),
  and Aboriginal and mining settlements to rely on fresh or desalinated brackish
  groundwater (Knott and McDonald, 1983; Jacobson et al., 1989; Jacobson, 1996).
  Economic growth and population growth will put added pressure on these supplies,
  which are recharged in part by occasional heavy rainfall events. Rainfall changes
  would have complex impacts on this groundwater supply because any reduced recharge
  would lower water tables and water supplies, and vice versa. The effects on
  water quality are not clear. </p>
<p>The water resources of atolls and low-lying islands are usually restricted
  to rainwater or limited sub-surface supplies. These are sensitive to climatic
  variations and environmental impacts, and in many cases are already stressed
  by unsustainable demand and pollution. With climate change, the freshwater lenses
  beneath coral atolls are exposed to saltwater intrusion from rising sea levels
  and possibly increased storm events, as well as to possible rainfall reductions
  where these occur. The indigenous populations of the Torres Strait, the Cocos
  (Keeling) Islands, and Pacific islands associated with New Zealand are likely
  to be affected. </p>
<p>The major Murray-Darling River system, in southeastern Australia, is heavily
  regulated by dams and weirs and supplies 10 billion m<sup>3</sup> of water annually
  for human use, mainly for irrigation. This amounts to about 40% of the mean
  annual flow. Application of various scenarios (e.g., CSIRO, 1992) has suggested
  a possible combination of decreased mean rainfall, higher temperatures and evaporation,
  and a higher frequency of extreme events (i.e., more floods and droughts) (e.g.,
  Schreider et al., 1996; see <a href="072.htm#figure4-2">Figure 4-2</a>); if
  so, the inflows to the system may be reduced, and if irrigation demands remain
  fixed or increase, the remaining river flows would substantially decrease (see,
  e.g., Hassall and Associates, 1997, and <a href="068.htm#box4-1">Box 4-1</a>).
</p>
<p>The Asian-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) team has simulated changes in drought
  and flood intensities for a wide region, including Australia and New Zealand;
  AIM (1997) shows results using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)
  Q-flux climate model (experiment A2 or A3). Based on the estimated magnitude
  of 10-year return period monthly discharge events, they show small and spatially-varying
  changes in flood discharge over Australia but apparently significant reductions
  in minimum flows in the Murray-Darling Basin. However, the rainfall simulation
  of experiment A2 over Australia is questionable (Whetton et al., 1994). </p>
<p>Because of the higher variability of Australian rainfall, the storage capacities
  of Australian water supply dams are typically about six times larger than those
  of European dams for the same percentage of mean annual streamflow and probability
  of water shortfall. In sharp contrast, New Zealand's higher and more reliable
  rainfalls enable its hydro-electricity system to operate on a total reservoir
  capacity equal to only about six weeks of national demand-albeit with the attendant
  risk of a rapid decline in supply in times of drought, as was experienced during
  1992 (Fitzharris, 1992). </p>
