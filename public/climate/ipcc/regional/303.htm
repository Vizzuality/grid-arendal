<h1>11.4. Integrated Assessment of Potential Vulnerabilities and Impacts</h1>
<p>Individual countries, regions, resources, sectors, and systems will be affected
  by climate change not in isolation but in interaction with one another. The
  direct effects of climate change to which this chapter alludes, such as changes
  in rice crop yields and inundation of coastal areas, will have further indirect
  effects. </p>
<p>Integration of impacts and adaptations to climate change can take many forms.
  Several different approaches can be considered for Tropical Asia, including
  the following: </p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Country-Specific Studies</i>-These studies have attempted to summarize
    salient aspects of vulnerability, impacts, and adaptations, generally in a
    qualitative manner. Some simple examples for India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and
    Thailand are given in Section 6.5 of the Working Group III contribution to
    the SAR (IPCC, 1996) and in ADB (1994a, 1994b). In these and other national
    studies, the conclusions usually are strongly thematic or sector-based.</li>
  <li><i>Geographical Integration</i>-Linkages between different functional regions
    are difficult to investigate although, at a conceptual level, they are readily
    acknowledged. For example, drainage basins can provide functional links between
    climate change impacts in headwaters and the downstream areas they affect;
    at the same time, however, downstream areas also may be responding to locally
    specific climate change impacts. Some simple examples have been described
    in this chapter (e.g., <a href="294.htm">Section 11.3.3.3</a>). Functional
    adaptations-such as through total river catchment analyses or integrated coastal
    management-are extraordinarily difficult to implement because of jurisdictional
    sensitivities, even though conceptual and methodological hurdles may be relatively
    easy to overcome.</li>
  <li> <i>Sectoral and Trade Integration</i>-There have been a number of attempts
    to integrate the various components of food supply (agriculture) in Tropical
    Asia, generally with simplified production change models in response to changes
    in environmental conditions (e.g,. temperature or precipitation and their
    derivatives, such as length of growing season and time of fruiting), some
    with yield adaptations and some without. These results are then integrated
    into an international trade-conditions model, and estimates of net economic
    welfare impacts are calculated. Reilly et al. (1993) have done this for Tropical
    Asia using three GCMs and 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium scenarios. </li>
  <li><i>Comprehensive Monetary Estimates</i>-Another way of integrating the range
    of potential impacts of climate change is to derive a comprehensive monetary
    estimate, which adds all of a country's impacts, expressed in their dollar
    value. Expressing damage to marketed goods and services (e.g., land lost to
    sea-level rise, energy savings in winter) in monetary terms is more or less
    straightforward because the price is known. Expressing damage to nonmarketed
    goods and services (e.g., wetland loss, mortality changes) in monetary terms
    can be done either through examining market transactions where such goods
    or services are implicitly traded (e.g., tourism, where landscape beauty is
    valued) or through interviewing people to determine their preferences (i.e.,
    their willingness to pay to secure a benefit or their willingness to accept
    compensation for a loss). Such valuation techniques reflect economic circumstances
    and value systems in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
    (OECD). The estimates for non-OECD countries in Chapter 6 of the Working Group
    III contribution to the SAR (IPCC, 1996) are based on extrapolation from studies
    in the OECD. With these caveats in mind, Chapter 6 of the WG III contribution
    to the SAR (IPCC, 1996) reports best estimates for the annual impact resulting
    from a doubling of atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> of about 2.1-8.6% of
    GDP in South and Southeast Asia. These figures compare with an estimated world
    impact of 1.4-1.9% of GDP. Many assumptions underlie these best guesses, however,
    and large uncertainties remain.</li>
