<h4>4.3.4.3. Vulnerability Assessments and Case Studies </h4>
<p>In Australia, vulnerability assessments were carried out for Cocos (Keeling)
  Island (an Australian Territory), Geographe Bay in Western Australia, and Kiribati
  in response to the first version of the IPCC Common Methodology (IPCC, 1991).
  This led to recommendations for changes to the Common Methodology (McLean and
  Mimura, 1993). </p>
<p>Meanwhile, a major vulnerability study was carried out by the Port of Melbourne
  Authority (1992) on the impact of projected greenhouse changes on the 3,000
  km of the Victorian coast. Quantitative assessment was carried out for selected
  beaches for 0.3- and 0.5-m rises in mean sea level, without considering other
  changes. The largest recession rates were indicated for beaches west of Cape
  Otway, due to the relatively fine sand and more severe wave conditions. Shoreline
  recession rates also were significant in parts of Port Phillip Bay and the Gippsland
  Lakes, due to generally narrower beaches. Detailed assessments identified beaches,
  barriers, estuaries, mudflats, swamps, and sedimentary cliffs that are particularly
  vulnerable. </p>
<p>A series of nine case studies initiated by the Australian Department of the
  Environment, Sport and Territories (DEST) on coastal vulnerability to climate
  change and sea-level rise was undertaken during 1994 and 1995 (Waterman, 1996).
  Impacts considered included sea-level rise, temperature and rainfall variation,
  changes in storm intensity and frequency, and saltwater intrusion into surface
  and groundwater supplies. Case studies were undertaken for Mackay, Queensland;
  Batemans Bay, New South Wales; Gippsland Lakes and Port Phillip Bay, Victoria;
  South Arm, Hobart, Tasmania; Northern Spencer Gulf, South Australia; Perth,
  Western Australia; and the Darwin and Alligator Rivers regions in the Northern
  Territory. Emphasis in the studies was placed on the wider socioeconomic, environmental,
  aesthetic, and cultural aspects, as well as strategies for integration of vulnerability
  assessment into coastal management and planning processes. The main aim in most
  of the studies, however, was to test the methodology rather than to produce
  definitive assessments of the vulnerability in the regions. </p>
<p>The studies found that vulnerability to climate change is difficult to determine
  in the context of the inherent variability of natural systems and the impacts
  of development on the coastal zone. In addition, the effects of change are poorly
  understood, and the implications for coastal management are not well appreciated
  by the wider community. The researchers concluded that community consultation,
  along with serious attempts to address the complex jurisdictional issues concerning
  coastal management, was essential. </p>
<p>Several of the studies, such as those for Port Phillip Bay and Hobart, noted
  the high degree of variability in potential impacts, even over distances of
  a few kilometers. The basis for identifying vulnerable areas was a geomorphological
  study that identified the main coastal landforms. At the broadest scale of generalization,
  the whole coast of Australia has been categorized by Chappell et al. (1996)
  according to several overlapping geomorphological and greenhouse hazard criteria,
  partly based on the work of Bird (1988, 1993) and Thom (1984). High wave energy
  coasts in the southern parts of the west and east of the continent are vulnerable
  to shifts in wave direction and energy, especially on beach coasts. Across most
  of northern Australia, rising sea level and changes in tropical cyclone activity
  are the greatest threats, whereas the Great Barrier Reef may benefit in some
  respects from moderate sea-level rises. </p>
<p>Severe limitations applied in quantitatively assessing likely impacts in the
  DEST case studies because of the wide range of uncertainty in the scenarios
  for sea-level rise, temperature and rainfall changes, and changes in storm intensity
  and frequency. Moreover, even in well-studied areas-such as the Alligator Rivers
  region in the Northern Territory, where rapid changes (such as saltwater intrusion
  into the Kakadu freshwater flood plains) (Knighton et al., 1991; Woodroffe and
  Mulrennan, 1993) have occurred in historical times-processes of natural change
  are not well understood. Nevertheless, it is clear that Kakadu National Park,
  which is a World Heritage Area and major tourist attraction as well as Aboriginal
  hunting and fishing grounds, would be almost totally transformed into mangrove
  forest by a sustained 1-m rise in mean sea level. </p>
<p>In several of the areas studied, towns such as Port Augusta, Port Pirie, Lakes
  Entrance, and Mackay have experienced partial flooding from the sea due to extreme
  events in the recent past, so they are very vulnerable to effects of sea-level
  rise. This was highlighted for Mackay by Smith and Greenaway (1994), who note
  a high sensitivity of flood damage to any change in the climatology of storm
  surges. </p>
<p>Potential vulnerability to health effects, particularly due to increases in
  standing water (see Section <a href="087.htm#health">4.3.6.1</a>), also were noted.
  The study of the Perth metropolitan coastline noted the natural "breakwater
  effect" of the offshore reef system and concluded that "climate change, natural
  or greenhouse-induced, appears to be more important to future changes ... than
  projected rises in mean-sea level." Saltwater penetration into the coastal aquifer
  also is an issue in the Perth region, as it is in some other coastal aquifers
  (Ghassemi et al., 1991). </p>
<p>Small, low-lying coastal and island communities are particularly vulnerable
  to sea-level rise and changes in climatic forcing of extreme events. These communities
  include several of the Torres Strait islands (Mulrennan, 1992), the Australian
  territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and several Aboriginal coastal communities
  across northern Australia. Unlike cities such as Darwin, these small communities
  usually do not abide by strict building codes or have evacuation procedures.
  Development of such codes and procedures therefore is necessary for effective
  adaptation. </p>
<p>The DEST project (Waterman, 1996) identified a number of issues concerning
  how policy and management decisions are made about the effects of climate change
  and sea-level rise by authorities and groups in coastal areas. Common methodological
  elements that should form part of a region-specific approach to vulnerability
  assessment were identified. Specific recommendations included capacity-building
  at governmental and community levels, including awareness raising; the development
  of a better appreciation of insurance, legal, and land-use planning implications,
  including professional and public liability; the development of a guide to best
  practice in integrated coastal zone management; and the development of benchmarks,
  monitoring programs, and databases for coastal zones. </p>
<p>In New Zealand, there has been no comprehensive national assessment of coastal
  vulnerability to climate and sea-level changes. Nonetheless, under the Resource
  Management Act (RMA) of 1991, local authorities are obligated to ensure the
  "avoidance or mitigation of natural hazards," including coastal flood and erosion
  hazards. Subsequent legal rulings have confirmed that future sea-level rise
  should be taken into account in coastal hazard analyses in connection with resource
  consent (permit) procedures as specified under the RMA. Furthermore, the New
  Zealand Coastal Policy Statement (Department of Conservation, 1994), which contains
  policies aimed at achieving the single purpose of the RMA (the "sustainable
  management of natural and physical resources"), includes specific reference
  to the possibility of a "rise in sea level" and its impacts on the subdivision,
  use, and development of the coast. </p>
<p>As a consequence of this policy framework, numerous coastal hazard studies
  have been commissioned by local authorities and developers in New Zealand for
  planning, policy development, and environmental impact assessment purposes.
  On the whole, these analyses-mostly in the form of unpublished consultants'
  reports-suggest that a considerable portion of the existing built environment
  of the New Zealand coast would be endangered by a future rise in sea level of
  the order of 0.5-1 m, especially along sandy beach and dune coasts. Where development
  pressures are high, such as in the Bay of Plenty, the potential increase in
  vulnerability is large unless adaptive measures are taken. </p>
