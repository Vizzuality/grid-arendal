<p>(continued...)</p>
<p><i>Agriculture</i>: Significant impacts on agriculture are likely, including
  crop and pasture performance increases from CO<sub>2</sub> rises; mixed effects of temperature
  rises; changes in soil fertility; changes in quality of grain and pasture nutrition;
  shifts in the suitability of districts for particular crops, such as kiwifruit;
  and possibly increased problems with weeds, pests, and diseases. </p>
<p>Impacts will vary widely from district to district, crop to crop, and decade
  to decade. Grain crops may gain in the first few decades because of the immediate
  beneficial effect of higher CO<sub>2</sub>, but that advantage may be eroded as the delayed
  rise in temperature becomes greater and reduces the grain-filling period. In
  Australia's warm low latitudes, some crops are near their maximum temperature
  tolerance and are likely to suffer increasingly as the temperature increases.
  The possibility of overall decreased rainfall in Australia would negatively
  affect rangeland pastoralism and irrigated agriculture (which is a major source
  of production). Any changes in global production, and hence international food
  commodity prices, would have major economic impacts. </p>
<p>Farming in the region is well adapted to dealing with variability and change
  through a variety of natural and market factors-for example, by means of plant
  breeding, diversification, seasonal climate prediction, and so forth. Such techniques
  are likely to be sufficient to adapt to climate change over the next few decades;
  in some cases, these techniques may facilitate expanded production. As the time
  horizon extends, however, the changing climate is likely to become less favorable
  to agricultural production in Australia, leading to a long-term increase in
  vulnerability. </p>
<p><i>Forestry</i>: Production forestry will be affected by changes in tree productivity;
  forest operational conditions; and weed, disease, and wildfire incidence. The
  net impact is not clear. The longer time to reach maturity results in a relatively
  large exposure to financial loss from extreme events, fire, or any rapid change
  in climate conditions. </p>
<p><i>Fisheries</i>: A number of climate sensitivities have been identified, but
  the impacts cannot be predicted with any confidence. It appears that freshwater
  and near-shore fisheries will be more affected than open-ocean fisheries. The
  principal adaptation option is scientifically based integrated fisheries management
  and coastal zone management. </p>
<p><i>Coastal zones</i>: The impacts on coastal zones of sea-level rise and climate
  change include inundation, riverine flooding, saline intrusion, erosion, and
  wave damage. The impacts of changes in weather conditions (winds, waves, storms,
  and storm surge) may be comparable to those of sea-level rise alone. Beaches,
  estuaries and coastal wetlands, and reefs-including the Great Barrier Reef-have
  adapted naturally to past changes in climate and sea level. However, in the
  future they are likely to face faster rates of change, and in many cases landward
  migration will be blocked by human land uses and infrastructure. Impacts will
  be complex, both physically and socioeconomically, and will vary greatly from
  place to place. There is potential for considerable damage to the region's low-lying
  coastal settlements and infrastructure where populations, tourism, and capital
  investment are large and growing. New Zealand also is exposed to impacts on
  its Pacific island territories, including the eventual possibility of environmental
  refugee fluxes. Some parts of Australasia's coastline, including a number of
  coastal cities and indigenous communities in low-lying coastal settlements and
  islands, are highly vulnerable. </p>
<p>Adaptation options include integrated coastal zone management; redesign, rebuilding,
  or relocation of capital assets; protection of beaches and dunes; development
  zone control; and retreat plans. </p>
<p><i>Human settlements</i>: In addition to possible changes in the frequency
  and magnitude of "natural disaster" type events such as urban fringe fires,
  floods, and extreme sea-level events, urban areas and industry will experience
  a variety of direct climatic impacts on water and air quality, water supply
  and drainage, waste disposal, energy production and distribution, minerals production,
  transport operations, insurance, and tourism. The effects of the direct impacts
  are likely to be small relative to other economic influences, but the sectors
  are very large, and the impacts and necessary adaptations may represent major
  losses and costs. Thus, a moderate degree of vulnerability is present. Adaptations
  will include improved planning, zoning, and engineering standards that take
  climate change and sea-level rise into account. </p>
<p><i>Human health</i>: Increases are expected in heat stress mortality (particularly
  in Australia), tropical vector-borne diseases such as dengue, and urban pollution-related
  respiratory problems. These impacts are small compared to the total burden of
  ill-health, but they have the potential to cause significant community impact
  and cost. Indigenous communities and economically disadvantaged persons appear
  to be more at risk. Adaptation responses include strengthening existing public
  health infrastructure and meeting the needs of vulnerable groups. A moderate
  degree of vulnerability is apparent with health. </p>
<p><i>Integration</i>: Some preliminary studies of impacts for limited areas or
  issues have been attempted for the region, but comprehensive integrated analyses
  are not available. A cross-sector economic costing approach indicates substantial
  impacts on Australasia's gross domestic product (GDP) (several percent per annum
  for a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>), but the method involved is subject to considerable criticism.
  The New Zealand CLIMPACTS and Australian OzClim software packages have been
  developed as national-scale, integrated assessment methodologies to enable the
  progressive exploration of sensitivities, impacts, adaptation options, and so
  forth as knowledge develops. </p>
<p><i>Research needs</i>: Research is needed on better climate scenarios; the
  dynamic responses of ecological systems; impacts on marine, aquatic, and coastal
  ecosystems; possible changes in the magnitude and frequency of "natural disasters";
  impacts on settlements, industries, and health; cross-sector and multinational
  interactions; and potential adaptations and their ameliorating effects. </p>
<p><i>Conclusion</i>: Australia's relatively low latitude makes it particularly
  vulnerable through impacts on its scarce water resources and on crops presently
  growing near or above their optimum temperatures, whereas New Zealand-a cooler,
  wetter, mid-latitude country-may gain some benefit from the ready availability
  of suitable crops and the likely increase in agricultural production. In both
  countries, however, there is a wide range of situations in which vulnerability
  is thought to be moderate to high-particularly in ecosystems, hydrology, coastal
  zones, settlements and industry, and health. </p>
