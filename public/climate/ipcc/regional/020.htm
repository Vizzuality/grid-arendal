<h4>2.3.2.3. Adaptation and Vulnerability</h4>
<p>Climate change will have various effects on water resources and water management
  in Africa. The large variability in projected climate scenarios over Africa's
  most vulnerable river basin systems (such as the Nile) makes any policy reformulation
  in anticipation of climate change difficult. However, improved efficiency in
  irrigation systems and water use are strongly recommended modes of action because
  they will benefit the region regardless of the degree and direction of climate
  change. Detailed studies of the river basins are essential to provide adequate
  information for planning and negotiation purposes in this area that will continue
  to generate tension across many borders. </p>
<p>Sharma et al. (1996) have evaluated the sub-Saharan African countries with
  respect to their degree of national commitment and planning to address water
  problems in general and have developed a list of country performance indicators
  (<a href="018.htm#table2-5">Table 2-5</a>). Columns 4-7 describe the enabling
  environment; columns 1 and 2 are poverty indicators; and columns 1, 2, and 3
  are risk indicators, where problems will call for either more water or more
  efficient management of existing stocks. The following points are critical:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The extent of political stability, ownership of development efforts, and
    commitment to sustainable water resources management in each country</li>
  <li>The extent to which an enabling environment exists-consisting of transparent
    and accountable governance in the water sector, clear legislation and policy,
    strategies and investment programs, stakeholder participation, and the capacity
    for water resources management at all levels</li>
  <li>The extent to which information and knowledge exists to gauge water availability
    and quality, consumer demand, and sectoral needs (e.g., sanitation coverage,
    irrigation, hydropower).</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowledge also is needed about multiple cross-sectoral linkages relating to
  a nation's water development (competing demands from agriculture, industry,
  and municipalities; reliance upon international waters). Depending on how a
  country fares with regard to the three critical points above, the types of efforts
  and interventions required by funding agencies and nations will vary. Countries
  that fare poorly in this analysis will be most vulnerable to climate changes
  because they will have less capacity to adapt. </p>
<h4>2.3.3. Agriculture and Food Security<a name="2.3.3"></a></h4>
<h4>2.3.3.1. Socioeconomic Vulnerability<a name="2.3.3.1"></a></h4>
<p>Many indicators of human development highlight Africa's relative poverty and
  vulnerability (<a href="#table2-6">Table 2-6</a>). With smaller holdings and
  little investment in agriculture, household production faces difficulties in
  meeting subsistence requirements or developing specialized export crops. Household
  expenditures on food are high-more than half of the annual budget, on average.
  Africa receives the largest amount of food aid of any continent. Low rates of
  female literacy and high rates of infant mortality are indicative of populations
  that have low status and inadequate infrastructure for education and health-two
  essential requirements for vigorous rural development. The high numbers of refugees
  highlight potential economic and political instability. Vulnerable populations
  include smallholder agriculturists with inadequate resources, pastoralists,
  rural landless laborers, and the urban poor. Rural populations are directly
  affected by climatic variations. Reduced food supplies and high prices immediately
  affect landless laborers who have little savings. The effect on agriculturists
  and pastoralists depends on how much surplus they produce and the relative terms
  of trade (e.g., between food and livestock). A dramatic increase in urban poverty
  has been noted in the past decade-one consequence of stagnant rural development
  and high population pressures. The urban poor are indirectly affected by climate
  change through changes in prices and regional investment. <br>

    </td>

      <p>Extensive droughts have afflicted Africa, with serious episodes since
	independence in 1965-1966, 1972-1974, 1981-1984, 1986-1987, 1991-1992,
	and 1994-1995 (WMO, 1995; Usher, 1997). The causes of African drought
	are numerous and vary among regions, seasons, and years. Local droughts
	occur every year; continental crises appear to occur once (or more recently
	twice) every decade. Major droughts tend to be connected to ENSO anomalies.
	It seems prudent to expect drought in Africa to continue to be a major
	climatic hazard. </p>
      <p>The potential effect of climate change on drought in Africa is uncertain.
	At a local level, increased temperatures are likely to lead to increased
	moisture demand. The balance between rainfall and higher evapotranspiration
	implies more frequent water scarcity. However, a great deal depends on
	vegetation response to higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and the timing of rainfall.
	The combination of higher evapotranspiration and even a small decrease
	in precipitation could lead to significantly greater drought risks. An
	increase in precipitation variability would compound temperature effects.
	For example, Hulme (1996b) reports that interannual variability increases
	on the order of 25% in much of southern Africa in the UKTR scenario for
	the 2050s. Within the region, however, some areas experience a similar
	decrease in variability. The temperature-precipitation-CO<sub>2</sub> forcing of
	seasonal drought probably is less significant than the prospect of large-scale
	circulation changes that drive continental droughts that occur over several
	years. A change in the frequency and duration of atmosphere-ocean anomalies,
	such as the ENSO phenomenon, could force such large-scale changes in Africa's
	rainfall climatology. However, such scenarios of climate change are not
	well developed at the global level, much less for Africa. </p>
      <p>The effects of drought are cross-cutting, with severe direct impacts
	on agriculture, water resources, and natural vegetation and indirect effects
	on health, the economy, and institutions (see Benson and Clay, 1994, for
	an overview of drought impacts). The impacts of drought are confounded
	by environmental degradation, including soil erosion, water pollution,
	and deforestation. Intersectoral linkages, the diversity of the economy,
	the numbers of vulnerable people, the intensity of water use in the economy,
	the role of financial systems and public enterprises, and public revenue
	and expenditure affect the severity and distribution of drought impacts.
	Drought in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s triggered widespread starvation
	and loss of life, particularly in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa. Similar
	famine has been averted in the 1990s through more effective early warning
	systems and responses. The aggregate impact of drought on the economies
	of Africa can be large: 8-9% of GDP in Zimbabwe and Zambia in 1992, 4-6%
	of GDP in Nigeria and Niger in 1984 (Benson and Clay, 1994). </p>
      <p>The 1991-1992 episode in southern Africa amply illustrates the impact
	of drought. In that episode, the SADC countries experienced the worst
	drought of the century: From central Zambia through central Malawi and
	Mozambique southward, there were seasonal deficits of as much as 80% of
	normal rainfall (Zinyowera and Unganai, 1993). Large sections of the SADC
	subregion received scanty rainfall-20-75% of normal-during the rainy season
	from October 1991 through April 1992. Abnormally high temperatures (47�C
	along the South Africa-Zimbabwe border) exacerbated the extreme dryness.
	Regional grain production fell 60% short of expected levels. Food stocks
	had been depleted, largely as a consequence of exports. Roughly five times
	more food had to be brought into southern Africa than had been delivered
	to the Horn of Africa during the famine of 1984-1985. Six different transport
	corridors were used to deliver food aid, and 11 countries assisted in
	trying to alleviate the crisis wrought by the drought. Even though 1992-1993
	and 1993-1994 could be considered post-drought periods, recovery in the
	subregion was slow. Nutritional status was affected by crop failure, depending
	on alternative sources of income and drought responses. The number of
	food-insecure households among communal farmers in Zimbabwe more than
	doubled during the 1991-1992 drought, especially in semi-arid zones (Christensen
	and Stack, 1992). The level of the reservoir at Kariba Dam, which supplies
	power to Zambia and Zimbabwe, fell below the level required to generate
	hydroelectric power (see IUCN, 1994). Water shortages, electricity shortages
	and rationing, input supply difficulties, reduction in demand, and macroeconomic
	constraints led to a 9% reduction in manufacturing output in Zimbabwe,
	with a 6% loss in foreign currency receipts (Benson and Clay, 1994).</p>
