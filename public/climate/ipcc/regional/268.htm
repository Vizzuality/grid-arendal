<h4>10.2.1.2. Deserts and Desertification </h4>
<p>Cold deserts and semi-deserts are widespread in west-central Temperate Asia.
  With projected shifts to warmer and drier conditions in Mongolia, the Gobi would
  change to warm temperate desert scrub, and the area of cool temperate desert
  scrub would expand to the Khangai mountains, supplanting forest areas (Ulziisaikhan,
  1996). At the same time, low- and midland parts of central Asia are likely to
  change gradually into a more arid interior desert as the disappearance of mountain
  glaciers reduces the volume of summer runoff. Projection of potential changes
  in the total extent of cool semi-deserts varies among models: Whereas BIOME
  1.1 suggests an almost 50% reduction in its extent, IMAGE 2.0 projects no change.
  However, desertification arises from adverse climatic conditions and from human
  abuse of the land; the latter can accelerate the desertification process (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 2.6). </p>
<p>Evapotranspiration rates over the grasslands in inner Mongolia of China are
  two to three times higher in midsummer than in spring or autumn, and the heat
  budget of the grassland under such a desertification process is close to that
  of a sand dune (Harazono et al., 1993). In northWestern China, the number of
  days each year when windstorms (greater than 17.2 m/sec) occur averages 20-40
  days in arid regions and 10-25 days in semi-arid regions-but reaches more than
  100 days in areas most affected (Xia, 1993; Zhao, 1996). These numbers are expected
  to increase under global warming because dryer and stronger-wind conditions
  are expected, resulting in accelerated soil degradation. </p>
<h4>10.2.1.3. Lakes, Streams, and Wetlands <a name="lakes"></a></h4>
<p>Significant shortening of the duration of ice cover in lakes is expected. Enhanced
  evaporation, as well as ground thaw, would cause some arctic lakes to disappear.
  Lakes in northern latitudes may change from a vertically homogeneous state to
  a stratified state (vice versa for those in southerly areas). These changes
  in mixing regimes are likely to have very important effects on biota (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Section 7.4.4). </p>
<p>Lake water levels are very sensitive to climate. In many regions, lake levels
  are likely to decline or fluctuate more widely because of changes in precipitation
  or increases in evapotranspiration. In lakes experiencing declines or rapid
  changes in water level, vegetation and habitat characteristics of highly productive
  inshore littoral areas may change significantly-with profound but highly lake-specific
  effects on food webs and productivity. Water-level declines in lakes with extensive
  bordering wetlands are likely to reduce lake productivity and populations of
  fish and invertebrates dependent on these wetlands for spawning and nursery
  grounds (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 10.5.2 and 10.6.2). </p>
<p>Climate change would result in a wide range of changes in the hydrological
  regimes of streams, with associated impacts on their ecosystems. For snowmelt
  streams, for example, a shift toward more rainfall and less snowfall in winter
  would result in a shift of the seasonality of stream discharge regimes toward
  higher winter flows and lower spring and summer flows. These changes may alter
  the timing of biogeochemical fluxes that could produce very important, but highly
  uncertain, effects on the biota in streams, lakes, and estuaries (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Section 10.3.5). </p>
<p>Model results based on six different climate change scenarios (precipitation
  increasing or decreasing by 10% and temperature increasing 1�C, 2�C, and 3�C)
  suggest that the areal extent of herbaceous wetlands in eastern China would
  decline as a result of reductions in total rainfall and increases in evapotranspiration
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 6.3.3). </p>
<p>Local extinctions and extirpations of cold-water and cool-water species of
  fish and invertebrates may be expected as a consequence of warming in the temperate
  zone. This effect will be most pronounced in shallow lakes, streams, and rivers
  in which appropriate thermal refugia (well-oxygenated deep waters, groundwater
  vents, access to higher elevations) are not available. Although biodiversity
  theoretically should increase with warming-particularly at mid- and high latitudes-initially
  there may be a loss in total diversity in cool temperate and boreal regions,
  if northward migration of warm-water species cannot keep pace with the rate
  of loss of cool-water and cold-water species due to limitations on dispersal
  (physiological limitations, lack of north-south corridors) and genetic adaptation
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 10.6.1 and 10.6.3). </p>
<p>Productivity and biodiversity in streams and rivers will likely be reduced
  in humid parts of Temperate Asia, which are expected to experience reductions
  in total rainfall and/or increases in evapotranspiration that produce longer,
  more severe droughts during the warm season. Declines in biodiversity would
  result from severe water quality deterioration (e.g., low dissolved oxygen levels,
  high concentrations of toxic substances, high temperatures) during extended
  low-flow periods in the summer, as well as from drying of previously perennial
  streams. These effects will be exacerbated in systems that are strongly affected
  by human activities (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 10.3.7, 10.4.2, 10.6.2, and
  10.6.4). </p>
