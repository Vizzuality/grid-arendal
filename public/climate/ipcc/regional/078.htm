<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Grain quality may decline as a result of increases in the frequency of high-temperature
  extremes during grainfill (Blumenthal et al., 1991a,b), and increased atmospheric
  CO<sub>2</sub> may reduce grain protein contents under some circumstances (e.g., Gifford
  et al., 1996). Any reduced protein content of grains would be detrimental for
  some grain products (like bread wheat), reducing their value, but advantageous
  for others (like brewing barley). </p>
<p>There is also the possibility of an increase in the incidence of pests and
  diseases and in some areas an increase in competition from weed growth (Farrow
  et al., 1993; Sutherst et al., 1996). However, Sutherst et al. (1996) noted
  the general lack of quantitative research on the effects of climate on weed
  species dynamics and the current inability to predict such interactions. </p>
<p>Temperature rises are expected to result in a general poleward shift in preferred
  crops and production systems, though there will be many subregional variations
  depending on the total climatic and soil requirements of a crop. </p>
<p>Higher temperatures will reduce the viability of existing temperate horticultural
  areas, especially with respect to winter chilling requirements for apples, stone
  fruit (Hennessy and Clayton-Greene, 1995), kiwifruit, and some vegetables and
  cereals such as winter wheat and barley. There are likely to be positive effects
  for tropical fruits and warm-climate crops such as maize and sweet corn. For
  these crops, the longer growing seasons, increased availability of "growing
  degree days," and reduced risk of early- or late-season frost damage will allow
  the use of later maturing cultivars with higher yield potential. Warmer conditions
  will accelerate crop development, allowing crops to avoid early- and late-season
  climatic risks and perhaps providing better timing of harvesting to meet market
  needs (e.g., Gifford et al., 1996b). However, unless cultivars are changed,
  the shorter growth duration will allow less opportunity for yield accumulation
  and hence lower yield. </p>
<p>Recent work using a simple model developed by Salinger and Kenny (1995) shows
  that a critical change in kiwifruit production in New Zealand may occur around
  the year 2050 (Warrick et al., 1996), although there are large uncertainties
  and caveats. Increased winter temperatures would reduce winter chilling, requiring
  the greater use of chemicals to manage the breaking of dormancy, but overseas
  market resistance may require reduction in the use of such chemicals in the
  future. Ongoing work using the CLIMPACTS model (see <a href="088.htm">Section
  4.4</a>) also indicates that warmer conditions will lead to later maturity of
  kiwifruit. Changes in maturity dates, especially for temperate, perennial fruit
  crops, may make it more difficult to match the timing of harvesting to market
  needs. </p>
<p>Biological risks are a major concern for the region's agricultural industries.
  As long-isolated island countries, Australia and New Zealand are extremely vulnerable
  to invasion by foreign weeds, insects, and pathogens for which there are no
  natural local biological controls (Sutherst et al., 1996). These invaders can
  directly affect the productivity and quality of pastoral lands, horticultural
  crops, and forest products and cause the closure of foreign markets to exports.
  Vulnerability to biological risks may alter under a changed climate, both from
  the direct effects on biota and ecosystems and indirectly from any adaptations
  that involve changes to crop types and farming systems. </p>
<p>Any changes in rainfall or rainfall reliability-for example, from changes in
  ENSO characteristics or other regional synoptic circulations-causing increased
  drought in drought-prone areas of either country could seriously affect pastoral
  and dairy production (e.g., McKeon et al., 1993). Irrigated agriculture produces
  a significant part of Australia's agricultural income, and rainfall decreases
  would have a major impact on the demand for and the relative availability of
  irrigation water (Pittock, 1995; Schreider et al., 1996; Hassall and Associates,
  1997). Conversely, wetter conditions may result in the expansion of cropping
  and pastoralism (McKeon et al., 1988). Some crops that require dry conditions
  at certain stages, like grapes, could be harmed by any increased frequency of
  unseasonal rainfall (Boag et al., 1988). </p>
<p>There may be increased risk of soil erosion in agricultural areas from the
  expected increase in the frequency of intense rainfalls (Yu and Neil, 1995).
  This will require improved soil surface management to reduce runoff rates (McKeon
  et al., 1988). </p>
