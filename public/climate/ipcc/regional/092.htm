<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<ul>
  <li> <i>Climate Change</i>. Climate model projections suggest a general increase
    in temperature, greatest in northerly latitudes. Precipitation changes are
    considerably more uncertain, but one could expect generally wetter conditions
    in the north, drier conditions in the south, and increasingly drier conditions
    from west to east. Winter precipitation may be greater than today, while summer
    precipitation is likely to decrease. </li>
  <li><i>Sensitive Regions</i>. As water is one of the main integrating factors
    for many environmental and economic systems in Europe, currently sensitive
    areas in terms of their hydrology include the Mediterranean region, the Alps,
    northern Scandinavia, certain coastal zones, and central and eastern Europe.
    A changing climate is likely to enhance water-related stresses in these already
    sensitive regions. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Vulnerability and Potential Impacts</b> </p>
<p><b>Hydrology, Snow and Ice, Water Supply and Demand</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Evapotranspiration will increase in a warmer climate, with potential reductions
    in water availability; however, the response of hydrological systems depends
    on the distribution of precipitation (highly variable, as suggested above)
    and storage capacity.</li>
  <li>Many regions in the southern and interior parts of Europe could experience
    a general decrease in runoff, though the change in runoff may range between
    -5% and +12%.</li>
  <li>More droughts could be expected in southern Europe, and the potential for
    winter and springtime flooding could be greater in northern and northWestern
    Europe. However, this pattern is not the same for all general circulation
    models (GCMs).</li>
  <li>Intrusion of saline waters into coastal aquifers and the expected reduction
    in precipitation could aggravate the problem of freshwater supply in some
    areas. </li>
  <li>Snow and ice are likely to decrease in many places, with consequences for
    the timing and amount of runoff in river basins, as well as winter tourism.</li>
  <li>Demand for water could increase in summer. Supply could decrease, though
    there may be regional differences in which storage capacity plays an important
    role. </li>
  <li>Pollution is a major stress factor for many European rivers, and a decrease
    in discharge would increase pollutant concentrations, leading to reductions
    in water quality.</li>
  <li>Current national and international policies and practices for water resources
    management will be put under stress by climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ecosystems</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>With the exception of parts of Scandinavia and the Russian Federation, Europe
    has few genuine natural ecosystems. Natural ecosystems generally are confined
    to poor soils and are fragmented and disturbed; consequently, they tend to
    be more sensitive to climate change than agriculture, which occupies the most
    fertile soils.</li>
  <li>The reaction of European ecosystems to global change is difficult to predict
    because there are a number of interactions and feedback loops between increasing
    temperatures, decreasing availability of soil water, and increasing carbon
    dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations.</li>
  <li>Increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increases the productivity of plants with C<sub>3</sub>
    metabolism under laboratory conditions (for most agricultural plants, except
    maize and millet). However, many other factors come into play under field
    conditions, such as water and nutrient stress, increased respiration losses,
    and interactions between species. Therefore, the overall change in productivity
    can only be predicted if these interacting environmental conditions are taken
    into account. Many studies indicate that CO<sub>2</sub> increases alone may have relatively
    little impact under field conditions.</li>
  <li>The forests in many parts of Europe are affected by high deposition rates
    of nitrogen. Their productivity is not only a function of climatic factors
    but of the change in nitrogen deposition, which can both act as a fertilizer
    and cause disturbances to many processes within the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Agriculture</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Crop mixes and production zones will be redistributed, and the use of water,
    fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides will shift with them. </li>
  <li>Conflicting demands for water-for instance, between irrigation and domestic
    supply in southern Europe-will need to be taken into account.</li>
  <li>Changes in potential production translate in a complex way to farmer incomes
    and food prices, depending on technology, farmer adaptation, world markets,
    and agricultural policies.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Coastal Zones</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sea-level rise will place additional stress on coastal zones already stressed
    by other factors (urbanization, coastal developments, pollution, etc.).</li>
  <li>The level of impact will depend on the adaptation capacity (e.g., the ability
    of systems to move inland) and policies of individual countries (e.g., trade-offs
    between lands that are not considered important and those that need to be
    protected).</li>
  <li>Sensitive zones include areas already close to or below mean sea level (such
    as the Dutch and German North Sea coastlines, the Po River delta, and the
    Ukrainian Black Sea coast), areas with low intertidal variation (such as the
    coastal zones of the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean), and coastal wetlands.</li>
  <li>Changes in the nature and frequency of storm surges, particularly in the
    North Sea, are likely to be of considerable importance for low-lying coastal
    areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Other Infrastructure, Activities, Settlements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Energy</i>. Changing hydrology will impact those energy and industrial
    production sectors that depend on water for cooling. There is a potential
    for increased energy demand related to cooling in summer, and decreased energy
    demand related to heating in winter. Such changes would lead to shifts in
    peak energy demand.</li>
  <li><i>Urbanization</i>. Infrastructure, buildings, and cities designed for
    cooler climates will have to be adjusted to warmer conditions, particularly
    heat waves, to maintain current functions.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Health</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>While there are fewer heat-related deaths in Europe than in some other parts
    of the world, the risk of heat-related deaths would probably increase with
    summer warming. The risk of cold-related deaths would probably decline with
    winter warming. It is not clear what the net change in risk would be for Europe.</li>
  <li>Warmer temperatures will exacerbate summer air pollution episodes and their
    health impacts in many cities.</li>
  <li>Some vector-borne infectious diseases will have the potential to extend
    their range; the adaptation capacity of individual countries will depend on
    their level of environmental management, public health surveillance, and health
    care.</li>
</ul>
