<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The Middle East and Arid Asia includes 21 countries of the predominantly arid
  and semi-arid region of the Middle East and central Asia. The region extends
  from Turkey in the west (26�10'E) to Kazakstan in the east (86�30'E) and from
  Yemen in the south (12�40'N) to Kazakstan in the north (50�30'N). Although the
  relief is mostly low, there are several peaks of 7,500 m or more in the Hindu
  Kush and Tien Shan mountain ranges; the lowest point is the Dead Sea in Israel
  (-395 m). Many of the region's countries are landlocked. The total population
  is 433 million, with half living in urban centers; six of the 21 countries have
  urban populations of over 80%. Countries of the region vary greatly in gross
  national product (GNP)-they include relatively resource rich, oil exporting
  countries and several poorer countries. </p>
<p><i>Climate</i>: Average monthly mean daily temperatures in the region range
  from -10�C to 25�C in January to 20�C to >35�C in July. The rainfall in the
  region is low but highly variable. Average monthly rainfall ranges from 0 mm
  to 200 mm in January and from 0 mm to 500 mm in July. </p>
<p><i>Climate trends</i>: Records of annual temperatures during the period 1900-96
  show almost no change for most of the Middle East region, but a 1-2�C/century
  increase for central Asia. There was a 0.7�C increase from 1900 to 1996 for
  the region as a whole. There was no discernible trend in annual precipitation
  during 1900-95 for the region as a whole, nor in most parts of the region-except
  in the southWestern part of the Arabian peninsula, where there was a 200% increase.
  This increase, however, is in relation to a very low base rainfall (<200 mm/yr).
</p>
<p><i>Climate scenarios</i>: Climate models project that temperatures in the region
  will increase by 1-2�C by 2030-2050, with the greatest increases in winter in
  the northeast and in summer in part of the southWest. Precipitation is projected
  to increase slightly in the winter throughout the region and in the summer to
  remain the same in the northeast and increase in the southWest (i.e., the southern
  part of the Arabian peninsula). These precipitation projections vary from model
  to model and are unlikely to be significant. Because of projected increases
  in temperatures, higher evaporation is expected. Soil moisture is projected
  to decrease in most parts of the region, which may lead to increased areas of
  soil degradation. </p>
<p>Because of the arid nature of the region, some sectors will be particularly
  affected by climate change. The impacts on these sectors are summarized below.
</p>
<p><i>Ecological systems</i>: The region is mostly arid and semi-arid and is dominated
  by grasslands, rangelands, deserts, and some woodlands. Vegetation models project
  little change in most arid (or desert) vegetation types under climate change
  projections. The impacts may be greater in the semi-arid lands of the region
  than in the arid lands, especially in composition and distribution of vegetation
  types. The projected small increase in precipitation is unlikely to improve
  land conditions in the next century, partly because soil conditions take a long
  time to improve and partly because human pressure on these systems may contribute
  to land degradation. Improved water-use efficiency by some plants under elevated
  carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) may lead to some improvement in plant productivity and
  changes in ecosystem composition. Grasslands, livestock, and water resources
  are likely to be most vulnerable to climate change in this region because they
  are located mostly in marginal areas. Management options, such as better stock
  management and more integrated agroecosystems, could improve land conditions
  and counteract pressures arising from climate change. </p>
<p>Forests/woodlands are important resources, although they cover only a small
  area. They will have to be safeguarded, given the heavy use of wood for fuel
  in some countries. </p>
<p>The region has a large area dominated by mountains, such as the Hindu Kush,
  Karakoram, and Tien Shan mountains in the eastern part of the region. Mountain
  areas are under pressure from human use, which is leading to land degradation
  in some areas. Some of the mountains have permanent glaciers, which will be
  affected by climate change. Glacial melt is projected to increase under climate
  change, leading to increased flows in some river systems for a few decades;
  this will be followed, however, by a reduction in flow as the glaciers disappear-creating
  larger areas of arid, interior deserts in low- and mid-lying parts of central
  Asia. </p>
<p>A tenth of the world's known species of higher plants and animals occur in
  this region. Many countries are centers of origin for crop and fruit tree species
  of critical importance to world food production; thus, they are important sources
  of genes of wild relatives. Few studies have assessed the impact of climate
  change on biodiversity in the region. Current human activity, however, is causing
  a loss of biodiversity. </p>
<p><i>Water resources</i>: Water shortages already are a problem in many countries
  of this predominantly arid region, and are unlikely to be reduced and may be
  exacerbated by climate change. Projected precipitation increases are small,
  and temperatures and evaporation are projected to rise. Rapid development is
  threatening some water supplies through salinization and pollution, and expanding
  populations are increasing the demand for water. Adaptation strategies might
  include more efficient organization of water supply, treatment, and delivery
  systems for urban areas and, in arid Asia, increased use of groundwater. Measures
  to conserve or reuse water already have been implemented in some countries;
  such strategies may overcome some shortages, especially if they are adopted
  widely throughout the region. Changes in cropping practices and improved irrigation
  practices could reduce water use significantly in some countries, especially
  those of the former Soviet Union (FSU). </p>
<p><i>Food and Fiber</i>: Land degradation problems and limited water supplies
  constrain present agricultural productivity and threaten the food security of
  some countries. Though there are few projections of the impacts of climate change
  on food and fiber production for the region, studies in Kazakstan and Pakistan
  have suggested some negative impacts on wheat yields. There are also projected
  increases (e.g., winter wheat in Kazakstan). Many of the options available for
  combating existing problems will contribute to reducing the anticipated impacts
  of climate change. Food and fiber production concentrated on more intensively
  managed lands could lead to greater reliability in food production and reduce
  the detrimental impacts of extreme climatic events, such as drought, on rangeland
  systems. Implementation of more flexible risk-management strategies (e.g., long-term
  and appropriate stocking rates, responding to variations in precipitation by
  changing animal numbers annually)-along with the use of a wider variety of domestic
  animals, game ranching, and multiple production systems-would provide greater
  food security to the region. </p>
<p><i>Health</i>: Human health in the region is variable, reflecting the economies
  of the countries. Some countries, where poverty is high, have high infant mortality
  rates and low life expectancies. The impacts of climate change are likely to
  be detrimental to the health of the population, mainly through heat stress and
  possible increases in vector-borne (e.g., dengue fever and malaria) and waterborne
  diseases. Decreases in water availability and food production (especially if
  there is a shortage of water for irrigation) would lead to indirect impacts
  on human health associated with nutritional and hygiene issues. </p>
<p><i>Integration</i>: Countries of the FSU are undergoing major economic changes,
  resulting in changes in agricultural systems and management. This transition
  is likely to provide significant "win-win" opportunities for the conservation
  of resources, to offset the impacts of climate change. Opportunities to change
  crop types and introduce more efficient irrigation are among the most promising.
  Human activity can exacerbate the effect of climate change in this arid/semi-arid
  region, leading to long-term detrimental effects on ecosystems and human health.
  The Aral Sea is an illustrative example of the multiplicative effects of resource
  overuse, which can lead to local environmental and even climate change. Extensive
  redirection of water from feeder rivers to irrigated agriculture since 1960
  has led to a reduction in the surface area of the lake, as well as damage to
  the surrounding wetlands and the species that depend on them. Air temperature
  in the vicinity of the lake has increased. Saline and polluted dust from the
  exposed lake bed has been implicated in significant health problems and increases
  in infant mortality. </p>
<p>There are some obvious research needs. Clearly, many basic physiological and
  ecological studies of the effects of changes in atmospheric and climatic conditions
  are necessary. The most pressing need over much of the region is for sound assessment
  and monitoring programs to establish current baselines and identify rates of
  change. </p>
