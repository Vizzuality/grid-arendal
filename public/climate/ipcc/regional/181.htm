<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Canada and the United States rank among the wealthiest countries in the world
  in terms of per capita income and natural resources. In fact, there is a strong
  link between the region's economic prosperity and well-being and that of its
  natural resources. For example, Canada, more than most industrialized nations,
  depends on the land for its economic well-being, with one in three workers employed
  directly or indirectly in agriculture, forestry, mining, energy generation,
  and other land-based activities (Government of Canada, 1996). In the United
  States, although dependence on primary production is lower, agricultural production
  and marketing account for 16% of employment, and almost half of the total land
  area (excluding Alaska) is dedicated to agriculture-related purposes (PCSD,
  1996). </p>
<p>North America has abundant energy resources-including uranium, oil, natural
  gas, and coal-and leads the world in the production of hydropower. It also is
  the world's largest consumer of energy, but because of more rapid growth in
  other regions of the globe, emissions from North America have shrunk from 45.1%
  of the global total in 1950 to 24.3% in 1994. The region historically and currently
  leads the world in greenhouse gas emissions, contributing 1509 million metric
  tons of carbon in 1994 (Canada, 122 million metric tons; the United States,
  1387 million metric tons) (Marland and Boden, 1997). </p>
<p>Water availability and quality are among the most common concerns expressed
  by North Americans (UNEP, 1997). Despite an overall abundance, water shortages
  occur periodically in some localities (e.g., arid sections of the western United
  States, the Canadian prairies, and some of the interior valleys of the Rocky
  Mountains). Compared with people in most other regions, North Americans are
  among the world's leaders in per capita water consumption, and the region enjoys
  relatively good water quality. Nevertheless, the availability of safe water
  remains a problem in a number of areas, particularly in rural and remote areas.
  Improper agricultural practices and by-product and waste disposal practices
  in some areas have contributed to impaired water quality of rivers, lakes, and
  estuaries. For example, large concentrations of industrial capacity and agricultural
  production (nearly 25% of the total Canadian agricultural production and 7%
  of the U.S. production) are located within the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence basin
  and have contributed to the reduced quality of the water contained within that
  basin (U.S. EPA and Environment Canada, 1995). </p>
<p>As in other regions of the globe, a number of pressures are being brought to
  bear on North America that are affecting the region's progress toward sustainability
  (e.g., population dynamics, land-use changes, changes in the global and regional
  economy, air and water pollution, consumption, and technological changes). Modern
  social and ecological systems, for the most part, have evolved and adapted to
  the prevailing local climate and its natural variability. Climate change, however,
  is an additional factor that will affect the evolution and adaptation (i.e.,
  sustainability) of these systems. It acts in combination with these other pressures,
  resulting in either a negative impact or, in some cases, an opportunity that
  could benefit an area or sector. Climate change impacts and the ability of North
  America to adapt, therefore, must be assessed within the broader context of
  these other changes and development trends. </p>
<p>Another factor for consideration is the relative sensitivity of any activity,
  resource, or area of the region to climate and how these other changes and pressures
  will affect that sensitivity. Population growth, changing demographics, and
  the movement of a large proportion of that population to coastal communities
  are projected to increase the sensitivity of North Americans to climate change
  and variability. For example, by the year 2000, more than 75% of the U.S. population
  (PCSD, 1996) and approximately 25% of the Canadian population (Government of
  Canada, 1996) will reside in coastal communities. Projected increasing demands
  on water resources-in terms of absolute amounts and multiplicity of demands-are
  expected to increase the climate sensitivity of these resources. On the other
  hand, increased energy efficiency and related technological advances are projected
  to decrease climate sensitivity through their positive impacts on reducing energy
  demands (e.g., energy for lighting, heating, and cooling). </p>
<p>Some of the key issues that need to be considered when interpreting the results
  of this assessment or deciding how to respond are as follows. </p>
<p><i>There are uncertainties associated with climate change and with the responses
  of natural and social systems to climate change, particularly at the regional
  and subregional scales </i>(IPCC 1996, WG I, Summary for Policymakers). Because
  of inherent uncertainties in our knowledge of the processes affected, our understanding
  of the magnitude of the responses is equally, or more, uncertain. These uncertainties
  are compounded further by uncertainties about how landowners and other decision
  makers will respond to associated risks. Assumptions about how people will respond
  to risks associated with climate change can significantly affect estimates of
  associated socioeconomic impacts. </p>
