<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Beyond improving agriculture using available strategies, what more should be
  done to plan for climate change? Ringius et al. (1996) provided guidelines on
  adaptation for agriculture and water in Africa (see also Downing et al., 1996).
  Anticipating climate change may be warranted for projects with long life spans
  (e.g., irrigation schemes); where the marginal cost of adaptation is small or
  brings benefits regardless of climate change; for protection against extreme
  events; and to prevent irreversible impacts (e.g., preservation of biodiversity).
  For example, the most certain aspect of climate change is increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.
  Efforts to enhance positive CO<sub>2</sub> responses in new cultivars may be worth the
  investment in plant breeding and agricultural technology, irrespective of projected
  changes in moisture availability. Strategic food reserves to buffer potential
  increases in the variation of local and national production might be relatively
  inexpensive at the international level but not warranted for most countries
  or at local grain banks. Drought early warning and preparedness could build
  upon the considerable improvements that already are underway in many regions
  of Africa, including making better use of seasonal climate predictions. </p>
<p>Protection against irreversible impacts or losses of valued resources may be
  warranted in some situations. Thus, if coastal erosion and sea-level rise threaten
  valuable coastal resources, protection measures may be cost-effective. For example,
  groundwater pumping may be required to lower the water table if saline intrusion
  affects agriculture in low-lying areas. It is unlikely that such projects are
  a priority in the near future. However, protection measures should be considered
  in the design of new development. </p>
<p>Regulation of resource allocation and development is deficient in much of Africa.
  Institutional and regulatory reform may be warranted to preclude development
  in areas that become increasingly hazardous (such as coastal zones) and to protect
  vulnerable communities (e.g., economic restructuring). Establishing priorities
  for development based on future land capabilities may be premature for most
  regions, but flexibility in development priorities should be retained and new
  information taken into account. For example, the ability of community groups
  to manage rapid resource changes may warrant further support. Market structures
  often support crops with a high level of risk and fail to support markets for
  drought-tolerant crops. Regulations that constrain free trade may increase the
  volatility of local markets and food supplies in response to climatic variations.
</p>
<p>If the present scope for adaptation is limited, investment in research and
  education are warranted to develop new solutions and stimulate behavioral changes
  to accommodate climate change. For example, development of cultivars that optimize
  responses to CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment and development and testing of new cultivars suitable
  for a range of likely climatic conditions require improved research. Education
  on environmental issues is warranted, although it is probably too soon to undertake
  specific campaigns designed to adapt to climate change. However, a broad capacity
  to address environmental issues and communicate understanding to stakeholders
  is urgently needed. This capacity is even more critical in linking greenhouse
  gas abatement with sustainable development issues. </p>
<p>Beyond specific adaptive actions, institutions may need to be strengthened-for
  example, to enhance the productivity of natural resources, to increase the capacity
  to respond to developmental pressures and resource crises, and to improve environmental
  quality. Concerning drought, institutions need to make better use of climate
  information to cope with climatic risks and reduce vulnerability. These are
  ongoing development objectives, but further assistance is warranted in light
  of the risk of changes in climatic hazards. </p>
<p>Ringius et al. (1996) evaluate four ensembles of adaptive strategies at different
  levels of planning: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Farm-level adaptive responses include substitution of agronomic practices
    (changes in sowing date, planting density, cultivars, etc.); altered inputs
    (e.g., fertilizer, pest and weed control, crop choice); and agricultural development
    (soil and water management that requires more substantial investment). The
    priority stakeholder is the smallholder farming sector. Commercial farms would
    be less likely to need assistance in these sorts of adaptive strategies. On
    the other hand, these strategies are less likely to be effective for agropastoralists
    and pastoralism in general. Such farm-level agronomic improvements can be
    effective, can be readily implemented, and have few substantial constraints
    to their adoption.</li>
  <li>At the national level, three strategies commonly are proposed:
    <ul>
      <li>Maintaining strategic reserves allows the government (or marketing bodies)
	to dampen price fluctuations and release food in emerging crises. Large
	national reserves have been held in the past, but have been reduced under
	structural adjustment agreements because of their cost.</li>
      <li>Markets and trading conditions could be adjusted to promote private-sector
	responses to climate change and climatic variability. This strategy might
	take the form of tax incentives for carryover stocks or bonds to smooth
	income between adverse and good trading years. This approach would build
	upon present efforts to reduce trade barriers, with some specific adjustments
	to accommodate climate change.</li>
      <li>Promoting agricultural development in general would close the gap between
	research and practice. The need to adapt to climate change could be used
	as one argument for fresh initiatives in promoting adaptive agricultural
	research and development in Africa. </li>
      <li>The primary beneficiaries of such national adaptive strategies are consumers
	and commercial producers who depend on markets for food consumption. Market
	adjustments may entail some trade-offs between consumers and producers
	or between relatively prosperous farmers and vulnerable smallholders who
	may not have access to inputs and markets. Yet the potential for multiple
	benefits is high (except for strategic reserves, which are a burden on
	the economy). As a group, these strategies would be reasonably effective
	in preparing for climate change.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>At the global level, some policies to prepare for climate change may be
    justified:
    <ul>
      <li>Climate change may require additional trade to smooth out fluctuations
	in national production. Maintaining international prices within acceptable
	limits would benefit poorer countries that might not be able to afford
	large imports in times of scarcity. In the transition toward a new climate,
	such an international capacity to prevent food deficits from becoming
	survival emergencies would appeal to the humanitarian goals of ending
	famine and reducing hunger. </li>
      <li>Encouraging free trade between and among countries should stimulate
	agricultural markets in regions with a comparative advantage. This trade
	may be a major benefit to some countries and a significant cost to others,
	as the impacts of climate change alter traditional markets. In principle,
	free trade allows national surpluses and deficits to be accommodated more
	efficiently. Thus, supply and price fluctuations are buffered at the global
	level, widening the potential pool of responses to climate change.</li>
      <li>International mechanisms to promote agrotechnology transfers to developing
	countries might focus on basic foodstuffs: wheat, rice, and maize. International
	agencies might license new technologies developed by biotechnology firms
	for dissemination and use in developing countries.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reducing drought risk and societal vulnerability would provide greater resilience
    in coping with climate change. Concerted action is required in three areas:
    mitigation to reduce vulnerability, monitoring drought and vulnerability,
    and preparedness to respond effectively to emerging crises. Considerable progress
    has been made in the past decade; a further decade of development might reap
    substantial rewards in efforts to eliminate widespread famine and enhance
    livelihood security, at least in times of drought (see Downing et al., 1996;
    Gibberd et al., 1996). The priority stakeholders should be the most vulnerable
    socioeconomic groups affected by drought crises-although many levels of local,
    national, and international actors are required to implement drought monitoring,
    mitigation, and emergency responses. </li>
</ol>
<p>These four broad strategies would promote African resilience in the face of
  present climatic risks and enhance Africa's capacity to adapt to climate change.
  In the next few decades, Africa must manage the transition from vulnerable subsistence
  agriculture to resilient, adaptive systems. If real progress is achieved, most
  regions and populations could cope with climate change over the next few decades.
  Climate change on top of continued vulnerability and agricultural crises threatens
  regional security. </p>
<p>The fundamental requirement for adaptation in Africa is to promote sustainable
  agricultural development-closing the gap between experimental yields and farm
  yields, overcoming constraints in markets, and providing rural infrastructure
  (credit, inputs, transport, etc.), which will enhance the capacity of the agricultural
  sector to contribute to local and national economic development. The overall
  aim should be to make the best use of climate as a resource for agriculture
  by enhancing the capabilities of agriculturists, agribusiness, and organizations
  to respond to climate variations and climate change. Perhaps the clearest specific
  objective at present is to prepare for climatic hazards by reducing vulnerability
  by way of developing monitoring capabilities and by enhancing the responsiveness
  of the agricultural sector to forecasts of production variations and food crisis.
