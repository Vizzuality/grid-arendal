<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>There is a need for assessments of crops, agricultural systems, food economy,
  and food security at local, national, and regional levels, but data are not
  readily available (IPCC, 1996). In some African countries, such studies are
  underway. </p>
<p>Adaptation to climate change is not automatic or autonomous. The motivations,
  constraints, and domains of authority of decisionmakers involved in shaping
  policy, implementing decisions, and coping with the consequences of changes
  in resources and hazards must be considered (see Grimble and Chan, 1995). The
  principal stakeholders in African agriculture range from vulnerable consumers
  and subsistence producers to national and international organizations charged
  with planning, research, and relief (see Gibberd et al., 1996, for examples
  in the context of seasonal climate prediction). Consumers are the ultimate stakeholders
  in adapting to climate change. For particularly vulnerable groups (such as resource-poor
  farmers, landless laborers, the urban poor, the destitute and displaced, or
  refugee populations), the outcome of strategies to adapt to climate change and
  climatic hazards may alter their livelihoods. Failure to cope with adverse change
  could lead to significant deprivation, social disruption, and population displacement.
  Producers adapt to climatic variations every season but have varying interests
  in climate change. Subsistence farmers are unlikely to have the resources necessary
  to consider specific strategies to adapt to climate change. Commercial farmers
  are more likely to be linked to national markets and international agribusinesses
  and able to invest in agricultural technology. However, adopting specific strategies
  depends on cost effectiveness within the context of short-term enterprise goals.
  One of the key stakeholders in enacting forward-looking strategies is business-from
  local market traders to international commodity and research organizations.
  However, commodity traders are not likely to be affected directly by the consequences
  of climate change, as long as production is viable and trade required somewhere
  in the world. Incentives may be required to induce agribusiness to adopt a longer
  planning horizon and to develop and implement adaptive responses. At present,
  the bulk of responsibility for designing, evaluating, and implementing strategic
  responses falls upon national governments, national and international research
  centers, and aid organizations (particularly bilateral and multilateral groups,
  although some international and even local NGOs may take an interest in adaptation
  policies). These are the same actors charged with development; extending their
  purview to longer-term climate change should not be difficult. </p>
<p>What options are available to different stakeholders to begin preparing for
  climate change in Africa? The impacts of climate change could be serious, at
  least in some regions and for some stakeholders. Equally important, however,
  climate change presents new opportunities that may promote development. <a href="#table2-8">Table
  2-8</a> lists generic agricultural adjustments that currently are practiced
  in Africa and may be appropriate to cope with climate change. Adjustments are
  grouped according to the level of the agricultural sector in which they might
  be applied: land management, crop variety and land use, crop husbandry, and
  farm-level economic adjustments (macro-economic and sectoral planning also should
  be considered). <a href="#box2-8">Box 2-8</a> evaluates one such adjustment
  in Zimbabwe. <br>

      <p>Throughout the world there is great scope to adapt to the agricultural
	impacts of climate change. Simulations with the CERES-Maize crop model
	at four sites in Zimbabwe illustrate the impacts of climate change and
	the effect of changing planting dates (Makadho, 1996; see also Muchena,
	1994; Hulme, 1996b). The CERES model simulates crop development and yield
	using specialized functions to calculate photosynthesis, phenological
	stage, evapotranspiration, and partitioning of biomass. Simulations were
	discrete, with the default initial soil water moisture set at the field
	capacity of the soils. Nitrogen stress and pests were not simulated. Average
	potential yields, as simulated with 40 years of climate data, range from
	more than 3.5 t/ha in Region II (Karoi) to barely 1 t/ha in Region V (Beit
	Bridge). There is a considerable gap between these potential yields and
	the yields realized by farmers in the region. In semi-arid zones (Region
	V), 500 kg/ha would be an above-average yield. Average commercial farm
	yields in the high veld are closer to the potential yield because of application
	of fertilizer. For the two equilibrium scenarios of climate change, yields
	decrease in the high veld (Karoi) and semi-arid region (Beit Bridge) but
	increase in the middle zones (Gweru and Masvingo). If the season start
	is adjusted, the yield decreases in the high veld, and semi-arid zones
	produce sizable increases. For example, planting on 15 October at Karoi
	results in 3.7 t/ha at present. With climate change and delaying planting
	to 1 November, yields would be 4.6 t/ha-a 25% increase. At Beit Bridge,
	the season would shift toward earlier planting to avoid high temperatures
	and water stress at the height of the summer.<br>
