<h4>5.3.1.1. Forests </h4>
<p>The species composition of forests in Europe is determined more by past management
  activities than by natural factors (Ellenberg, 1986). Because there currently
  is a tendency toward a more ecological approach to forest management (e.g.,
  Innes, 1993; L�m�s and Fries, 1995), it will be difficult to separate the influence
  of changing climates from the influence of changing management practices. The
  trend toward tree species compositions in forests that more closely mimic those
  occurring naturally has been regarded as making the forests more adaptable to
  climate change. The evidence to support this hypothesis, however, is very limited
  (see, e.g., Fries et al., 1997). Current species combinations are based on today's
  conditions; future communities are likely to be composed of species assemblages
  that do not necessarily occur today (Lindner et al., 1997). The successful establishment
  today of species mixes that will be appropriate for future climatic conditions
  represents a major challenge for modern silviculture. </p>
<p>The range of European forests is limited primarily by climate, either through
  moisture availability or through temperature (both absolute amounts and seasonal
  distributions) (Berninger, 1997). A change in temperature or precipitation will
  affect the current distributions and productivity of forests (Bugmann, 1996;
  Lindner et al., 1996; Kellomaki et al., 1997). The response can be predicted
  with greater ease at the northern boundaries of forests in Fennoscandia and
  northern Russia, where an expansion of Norway spruce and Scotch pine into tundra
  regions is likely to occur under warmer conditions (Sykes and Prentice, 1996).
  These changes would be accompanied by a northward movement of the southern limit
  of these two species in Fennoscandia. Similar conclusions were reached by Kr�uchi
  (1995), whose model predictions indicated the replacement of Norway spruce by
  beech and other broad-leaved species at a site in northern Germany (Solling),
  associated with an increase in mean annual temperature of 0.3�C/decade until
  the end of the 21st century. </p>
<p>The rate of northward extension of the forest limit and individual species
  is highly uncertain because it depends not only on the rate of climate change
  but also on associated rates of dispersal (Malanson and Cairns, 1997), soil
  development, species composition (e.g., spruce/pine/beech) (Sykes and Prentice,
  1996), and age of the trees. Such changes in the distribution of species will
  be highly individualistic (Huntley and Webb, 1989; Huntley, 1991)-with some
  species expanding their ranges, some showing little or no change, and others
  contracting their ranges (Sykes and Prentice, 1995, 1996), possibly to the point
  of extinction. Climate projections suggest a displacement of climatic zones
  suitable for forests by 150-550 km over the next century (IPCC 1996, WG II,
  Chapter 1). This shift is faster than the estimated potential of many species
  to migrate (20-200 km/century) (Davis, 1981; Birks, 1989) or the capability
  of many soils to develop a new structure. </p>
<p>In mountain regions, certain species and communities could disappear altogether
  because the upward displacement of species living close to the upper reaches
  of mountains will be constrained by the lack of any place in which they can
  become established (Kienast, 1991; Kienast et al., 1996). Modeling studies in
  Switzerland (Kr�uchi and Kienast, 1993) suggest that a temperature increase
  of 3�C would result in deciduous broad-leaved trees invading the subalpine belt
  and coniferous trees invading the alpine zone. Within the deciduous zone, colline
  Carpinion forests would expand at the expense of sub-montane and low-montane
  beech forests (Brzeziecki et al., 1995). The species composition of future forests
  would depend on changes in the continentality of each site. Such results have
  not yet been confirmed by empirical studies. H�ttenschwiler and K�rner (1995)
  found no indication of an upward movement in Scotch pine in the Swiss central
  Alps in response to summer temperatures during the period 1982-1991-when temperatures
  were, on average, 0.8�C warmer than those of the period 30 years before. They
  argued that the primary control on the altitudinal distribution of Scotch pine
  and Arolla pine (Pinus cembra L.) was more likely to be interspecific competition
  than temperature. However, some studies (e.g., Hofer, 1992; Grabherr et al.,
  1994) have noted an upward shift in the distribution of some alpine species.
</p>
<p>Changes in the forests of southern Europe are most likely to be driven primarily
  by changes in water availability, although changes in temperature (particularly
  reductions in frost occurrence) also may play a role in the expansion of some
  forest types (e.g., Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus rotundifolia). Changes in
  precipitation will determine the relative importance of sclerophyllous and deciduous
  species; water availability in the period April-June would be particularly important
  (Gavil�n and Fern�ndez-Gonz�lez, 1997). </p>
<p>Many changes in forests may occur as a consequence of subtle alterations in
  the competitive balance between species. For example, rising temperatures are
  likely to change the time interval between budburst and leaf fall, but the effects
  will differ among species. Kramer (1995) argues that the duration of the growing
  season is likely to decrease with increasing temperature for European larch
  (Larix decidua Miller) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), whereas it will
  increase for beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata
  Miller). There already is some evidence that a substantial (25-30%) proportion
  of the forests in Switzerland is poorly adapted to the expected natural species
  distribution under current climatic conditions-and that this proportion will
  increase with an increase in temperature (Kienast et al., 1996). Similar patterns
  are likely elsewhere in Europe. </p>
