<p>Climate change impacts on hydrological cycles are expected to be greatest in
  semi-arid and arid areas; on lakes and streams in high evaporative drainages;
  in basins with small catchments and relatively short retention times; in shallow
  lakes, streams, and rivers in which appropriate thermal refugia are not available;
  and on irrigation systems that rely on isolated reservoirs or snowmelt from
  seasonal snowfall (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapters 7 and 10). The implications of
  climate warming on the hydrological cycle and its consequences for precipitation
  distribution, intensity, and timing; surface runoff; and underground water resources
  will be aggravated in certain areas by population growth and unsustainable development
  of water-consuming activities. Country studies undertaken to satisfy commitments
  under the UNFCCC indicate the vulnerability of Latin American communities that
  are dependent on water resource availability. In this respect, reduced precipitation
  has had serious consequences for hydropower production in Central American countries;
  for example, ENSO events during the past decades in Costa Rica led to significant
  reductions in runoff and consequently to a higher demand for thermal energy
  production (Campos et al., 1996) (see <a href="#figure6-5">Figure 6-5</a>).
  On the other hand, increased precipitation (up to 35% in the province of La
  Pampa) has been observed in the Pampas-the most important area for grain and
  livestock production in Argentina (Canziani et al., 1987; Forte-Lay, 1987; Vargas,
  1987). The benefits from such an increase in precipitation have been offset
  by more frequent extreme precipitation events and higher risks of flooding.

  Extreme precipitation events could increase the number of reservoirs in the
  humid tropics that silt up well before their design lives have been reached.
  Poor management of a basin (e.g., severe deforestation in drainage areas, especially
  in the case of rivers flowing along deep valleys) would increase erosion and
  interact with hydrological changes, causing siltation and decreasing the potential
  for hydroelectricity generation (Bruijnzeel and Critchley, 1994; Campos et al.,
  1996). </p>
<p>Lakes have individualistic and often rapid responses to climate changes. Lake
  Titicaca, for example, experienced a 6.3-m rise in water level from 1943 to
  1986 (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.5.2). This increase exceeds by a factor of
  40 the change in mean sea level estimated from global warming. Fluctuations
  in lakes with large temporal changes in water level are expected to be aggravated
  by climate change. Changes in mixing regimes also are projected as a result
  of climate change in temperate zones because of increases in winter air temperatures-with
  potentially large effects on biota. </p>
<p>Wetlands are distributed throughout the region but are more extensive in the
  tropics and subtropics. The effects of climate change on wetlands remain very
  uncertain (Gorham, 1991; IPCC 1996, WG II, Figure 6-1). Human intervention may
  be more critical than climate change in affecting these ecosystems. </p>
<p>Freshwater fisheries and aquaculture generally could benefit from climate change,
  though there could be some significant negative effects, depending on the species
  and on climate changes at the local level. Positive factors associated with
  warming and increased precipitation at higher latitudes include faster growth
  and maturation rates, lower winter mortality rates from cold or anoxia, and
  expanded habitats as a result of ice retreat. Offsetting negative factors include
  increased summer anoxia, increased demand for food to support higher metabolisms,
  possible negative changes in lake thermal structures, and reduced thermal habitat
  for cold-water species. Individual effects are difficult to integrate. However,
  warm-water lakes generally have higher productivity levels than cold-water lakes;
  because of the latitudinal distribution of projected warming, warm-water lakes
  will be in areas with the least change in temperature. It is reasonable to expect
  higher overall productivity from freshwater systems. Finally, fishery managers
  heavily manipulate freshwater fisheries, and aquaculture is expanding in many
  Latin American countries. If species mixes continue to be changed to support
  angler and market preferences and changing habitats, climate-change damages
  may diminish while benefits increase. </p>
<p>Impacts on biota-including commercial and subsistence fisheries-are expected
  to be most pronounced in isolated systems, such as high-elevation Andean lakes
  or lakes in the far south of Argentina and Chile, as well as in areas in which
  species are close to their geographical distribution limits. Within large drainage
  systems, flexibility for migratory shifts to compatible temperatures will be
  greater in north-south flowing systems (Meisner, 1990; IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections
  10.6.1.2, 16.2.1). </p>
<p>The effects of climate change on freshwater ecology will interact strongly
  with anthropogenic changes in land use, waste disposal, and water extraction.
  Regional water resources will become increasingly stressed because of higher
  demands to meet the needs of growing populations and economies, as well as temperature
  increases. These anthropogenic effects are expected to increase in Latin America,
  and there is a risk that these impacts will extend to tropical streams and wetlands
  that, owing to their remoteness, have so far escaped the impacts of human activities
  (Armentano, 1990; IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 6.3 and 10.2.2). </p>
<p>Conflicts may arise among users and regions and among Latin American countries
  that share common river basins. The effects of climate change on agricultural
  demands for water, particularly for irrigation, will depend significantly on
  changes in agricultural potential, prices of agricultural produce, and water
  costs (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 14), as well as on other consumptive uses.
  Water availability in two countries of the region (Mexico and Peru; see <a href="#box6-3">Box
  6-3</a>) is expected to decline significantly with respect to the present climate.
  Furthermore, as has happened in the past, reductions in or a lack of freshwater
  availability, or cases of excess leading to flood conditions, may lead to interstate
  or international conflicts or invasion of neighboring territories by "campesinos"
  in distress. <br>
