<h1>Europe</h1>
<p>Europe constitutes the western part of the Eurasian continent. Its eastern
  boundary is formed by the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, and part of the Caspian
  Sea. The proximity of the relatively warm Gulf Stream and typical atmospheric
  circulation contribute to the large spatial and temporal variability of the
  region's temperature and precipitation. South of the main Alpine divide, the
  climate is of the Mediterranean type. </p>
<p><i>Ecosystems</i>: Natural ecosystems generally are fragmented, disturbed,
  and confined to poor soils. This situation makes them more sensitive to climate
  change. Mediterranean and boreal grasslands may shift in response to changes
  in the amount and the seasonal distribution of precipitation. The northern boundaries
  of forests in Fennoscandia and northern Russia would likely expand into tundra
  regions, reducing the extent of tundra, mires, and permafrost areas. Survival
  of some species and forest types may be endangered by the projected movement
  of climate zones at rates faster than migration speeds. High-elevation ecosystems
  and species are particularly vulnerable because they have nowhere to migrate.
  An increase in temperature, accompanied by decreases in soil moisture, would
  lead to a substantial reduction in peat formation in Fennoscandian and northern
  Russian peatlands. Thawing of the permafrost layer would lead to lowered water
  tables in some areas and would flood thaw lakes in others, altering current
  wetland ecosystem types. Although the diversity of freshwater species may increase
  in a warmer climate, particularly in middle and high latitudes, there may be
  an initial reduction in species diversity in cool temperate and boreal regions.
  Ecosystems in southern Europe would be threatened mainly by reduced precipitation
  and subsequent increases in water scarcity. </p>
<p><i>Hydrology and Water Resources</i>: Most of Europe experienced temperature
  increases this century larger than the global average, and enhanced precipitation
  in the northern half and decreases in the southern half of the region. Projections
  of future climate, not taking into account the effect of aerosols, indicate
  that precipitation in high latitudes of Europe may increase, with mixed results
  for other parts of Europe. The current uncertainties about future precipitation
  are mainly exacerbated by the effects of aerosols. </p>
<p>Water supply may be affected by possible increases in floods in northern and
  northWest Europe and by droughts in southern portions of the continent. Many
  floodplains in western Europe already are overpopulated, which hampers effective
  additional flood protection. Pollution is a major problem for many rivers; a
  warmer climate could lead to reduced water quality, particularly if accompanied
  by reduced runoff. Warmer summers would lead to increased water demand, although
  increased demand for irrigation would be at least partly offset for many crops
  by increased water-use efficiency associated with CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization. </p>
<p>Expected changes in snow and ice will have profound impacts on European streams
  and rivers. Up to 95% of Alpine glacier mass could disappear by 2100, with subsequent
  consequences for the water flow regime-affecting, for example, summer water
  supply, shipping, and hydropower. Also, in some areas, winter tourism would
  be negatively affected. </p>
<p>Water management is partly determined by legislation and cooperation among
  government entities, within countries and internationally; altered water supply
  and demand would call for a reconsideration of existing legal and cooperative
  arrangements. </p>
<p><i>Food and Fiber Production</i>: Risks of frost would be reduced in a warmer
  climate, allowing winter cereals and other winter crops to expand to areas such
  as southern Fennoscandia and western Russia. Potential yields of winter crops
  are expected to increase, especially in central and southern Europe, assuming
  that neither precipitation nor irrigation are limiting and that water-use efficiency
  increases with the ambient atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>. Increasing spring
  temperatures would extend suitable zones for most summer crops. Summer crop
  yield increases are possible in central and eastern Europe, though decreases
  are possible in western Europe. Decreases in precipitation in southern Europe
  would reduce crop yields and make irrigation an even larger competitor to domestic
  and industrial water use. Along with potential crop yields, farmer adaptation,
  agricultural policy, and world markets are important factors in the economic
  impact of climate change on the agricultural sector. </p>
<p><i>Coastal Systems</i>: Coastal zones are ecologically and economically important.
  Settlement and economic activity have reduced the resilience and adaptability
  of coastal systems to climate variability and change, as well as to sea-level
  rise. Some coastal areas already are beneath mean sea level, and many others
  are vulnerable to storm surges. Areas most at risk include the Dutch, German,
  Ukrainian, and Russian coastlines; some Mediterranean deltas; and Baltic coastal
  zones. Storm surges, changes in precipitation, and changes in wind speed and
  direction add to the concern of coastal planners. In general, major economic
  and social impacts can be contained with relatively low investment. This is
  not true, however, for a number of low-lying urban areas vulnerable to storm
  surges, nor for ecosystems-particularly coastal wetlands-which may be even further
  damaged by protective measures. </p>
<p><i>Human Settlements</i>: Supply and demand for cooling water will change.
  Energy demand may increase in summer (cooling) and decrease in winter (heating),
  and peak energy demand will shift. Infrastructure, buildings, and cities designed
  for cooler climates will have to be adjusted to warming, particularly heat waves,
  to maintain current functions. In areas where precipitation increases or intensifies,
  there are additional risks from landslides and river floods. </p>
<p><i>Human Health</i>: Heat-related deaths would increase under global warming
  and may be exacerbated by worsening air quality in cities; there would be a
  reduction in cold-related deaths. Vector-borne diseases would expand. Health
  care measures could significantly reduce such impacts. </p>
<p><i>Conclusions</i>: Even though capabilities for adaptation in managed systems
  in many places in Europe are relatively well established, significant impacts
  of climate change still should be anticipated. Major effects are likely to be
  felt through changes in the frequency of extreme events and precipitation, causing
  more droughts in some areas and more river floods elsewhere. Effects will be
  felt primarily in agriculture and other water-dependent activities. Boreal forest
  and permafrost areas are projected to undergo major change. Ecosystems are especially
  vulnerable due to the projected rate of climate change and because migration
  is hampered. </p>
