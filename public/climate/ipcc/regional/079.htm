<h4>4.3.3.2. Production Forestry </h4>
<p>The production of wood and paper products is a major industry in the region.
  In New Zealand, the industry is primarily based on plantations of fast-growing
  exotic species, whereas in Australia there is still a considerable forest industry
  based on native eucalypt forests in addition to expanding plantation forests.
  A rising world population, combined with increased living standards, may (at
  current prices) demand more wood than can be supplied from global resources
  by the year 2050. Temperate forest products are expected to play an important
  role in meeting demand (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 15.2.3, 15.4.3). There also
  is an increasing trend to see plantation forests as a means of sequestering
  carbon in the region (Maclaren, 1996). </p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization is likely to increase growth, especially when trees are water
  limited. However, growth enhancements due to increased temperature may occur
  only in trees not subject to water limitations (Landsberg, 1996). As already
  noted, however, the CO<sub>2</sub> impact on tree growth decreases with time for many species
  (Gunderson and Wullschleger, 1994). Any overall reductions in rainfall or changes
  in seasonality that result in water limitations or prolongation of droughts
  would negatively affect production and plantation seedling establishment. On
  the positive side, in New Zealand forestry many of the worst exotic weeds are
  C<sub>4</sub> plants, so the competitive effects may be reduced if elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration
  favors growth of C<sub>3</sub> over C<sub>4</sub> plants in temperate zones. Again, however, this
  gain might be negated by the relative advantage of C<sub>4</sub> plants at higher temperatures.
  Changes in tree and forest water use would alter the catchment hydrological
  characteristics, particularly runoff and extreme events (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections
  14.2, 14.4). </p>
<p>The exposure of forests and forest operations to fire risk may increase, particularly
  in Australia, and there is potential for changes in the frequency and intensity
  of damaging events from wind and storm, particularly in New Zealand. More intense
  rainfall events would exacerbate soil erosion and pollution of streams during
  forestry operations and make these operations more difficult to carry out. Warmer
  and wetter conditions could provide the opportunity for increased incidence
  of arthropod pests and pine needle blight (Dothistroma pini). Pinus radiata
  constitutes 91% of the exotic plantation forests in New Zealand and 68% in Australia,
  so this blight is a major potential risk to production forestry. </p>
<p>An important distinguishing feature of forestry is the long time scale of the
  tree lifecycle and the very large investment in the standing crop relative to
  the annual yield. Whereas a wheat farmer stands to lose one year's production
  in a climatic disaster, a forester may have at risk a full 30 years' growth.
  Thus, more so than with agricultural crops, global change has the potential
  to adversely affect the substantial accumulated capital of a standing forest.
  Furthermore, the long time scale means there are less frequent opportunities
  to apply adaptation options to any particular forest. The slower growing indigenous
  forests will be even more affected than the fast-rotation exotic forest plantations.
</p>
<h4>4.3.3.3. Fisheries<a name="fish"></a> </h4>
<p>Relatively little is known about how climate affects marine fishes-particularly
  in the Southern Hemisphere, where data series tend to be short. Thus, it is
  extremely difficult to predict how climate change may affect Australasia's fish
  stocks and fishing industry, particularly in the context of the present stresses
  on fish stocks. There is some evidence, however, that climate impacts can be
  quite profound. The IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) concluded that although
  global marine fisheries production may remain about the same-despite possible
  changes in dominant species-there are likely to be collapses and expansions
  of specific regional fisheries (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 16.2.2). These conclusions
  may likewise apply to large oceanic regions like Australasia, though current
  knowledge is not adequate to predict the impacts-positive or negative-on total
  productivity for the region. </p>
<p>In these circumstances, mobile high-seas fishing fleets are less likely to
  be affected, provided that access regulation is not tied to geographical areas.
  However, among the more localized small-scale fishers, who are dependent on
  specific in-shore fisheries, there may be large gains and large losses if fish
  populations shift their areas of abundance (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 16). In
  addition, in-shore fisheries and marine stocks that need to reproduce in freshwater,
  estuaries, or mangroves may be negatively affected by changes in terrestrial
  and coastal processes, such as increased pollution and sediment discharge or
  loss of habitat. The economic impacts are unclear but could be significant for
  some parts of the industry. </p>
<p>Climate conditions are a factor in the outbreaks of bloom-forming algae and
  shellfish diseases that periodically occur in Australasian waters. These organisms
  include naturally occurring species and exotic species introduced by discharge
  of ships' ballast water. In the region's nontropical waters, some of the organisms
  are likely to be at the margins of suitable temperature conditions, and warming
  may give them increased opportunities to survive, spread, and form problem populations
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 16.2.4). </p>
<p>Aquaculture and freshwater fisheries at mid-latitudes may benefit from longer
  growing seasons, lower natural winter mortality, and faster growth rates. Studies
  for New Zealand suggest that rising sea level and temperatures may increase
  oyster farm areas and productivity-but that sea temperatures may become excessive
  for salmon farming. Any increases in rainfall intensity over land are likely
  to increase coliform bacteria counts in runoff and result in more frequent closures
  of shellfish beds (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 16.2.3). </p>
