<h1>Coastal Systems</h1>
<p>Coastal zones are characterized by a rich diversity of ecosystems and a great
  number of socioeconomic activities. Coastal human populations in many countries
  have been growing at double the national rate of population growth. It is currently
  estimated that about half of the global population lives in coastal zones, although
  there is large variation among countries. Changes in climate will affect coastal
  systems through sea-level rise and an increase in storm-surge hazards and possible
  changes in the frequency and/or intensity of extreme events. </p>
<p>Coasts in many countries currently face severe sea-level rise problems as a
  consequence of tectonically and anthropogenically induced subsidence. An estimated
  46 million people per year currently are at risk of flooding from storm surges.
  Climate change will exacerbate these problems, leading to potential impacts
  on ecosystems and human coastal infrastructure. Large numbers of people also
  are potentially affected by sea-level rise-for example, tens of millions of
  people in Bangladesh would be displaced by a 1-m increase (the top of the range
  of IPCC Working Group I estimates for 2100) in the absence of adaptation measures.
  A growing number of extremely large cities are located in coastal areas, which
  means that large amounts of infrastructure may be affected. Although annual
  protection costs for many nations are relatively modest-about 0.1% of gross
  domestic product (GDP)-the average annual costs to many small island states
  total several percent of GDP. For some island nations, the high cost of providing
  storm-surge protection would make it essentially infeasible, especially given
  the limited availability of capital for investment. </p>
<p>Beaches, dunes, estuaries, and coastal wetlands adapt naturally and dynamically
  to changes in prevailing winds and seas, as well as sea-level changes; in areas
  where infrastructure development is not extensive, planned retreat and accommodation
  to changes may be possible. It also may be possible to rebuild or relocate capital
  assets at the end of their design life. In other areas, however, accommodation
  and planned retreat are not viable options, and protection using hard structures
  (e.g., dikes, levees, floodwalls, and barriers) and soft structures (e.g., beach
  nourishment, dune restoration, and wetland creation) will be necessary. Factors
  that limit the implementation of these options include inadequate financial
  resources, limited institutional and technological capability, and shortages
  of trained personnel. In most regions, current coastal management and planning
  frameworks do not take account of the vulnerability of key systems to changes
  in climate and sea level or long lead times for implementation of many adaptation
  measures. Inappropriate policies encourage development in impact-prone areas.
  Given increasing population density in coastal zones, long lead times for implementation
  of many adaptation measures, and institutional, financial, and technological
  limitations (particularly in many developing countries), coastal systems should
  be considered vulnerable to changes in climate. </p>
<h1>Human Health<a name="human"></a></h1>
<p>In much of the world, life expectancy is increasing; in addition, infant and
  child mortality in most developing countries is dropping. Against this positive
  backdrop, however, there appears to be a widespread increase in new and resurgent
  vector-borne and infectious diseases, such as dengue, malaria, hantavirus, and
  cholera. In addition, the percentage of the developing world's population living
  in cities is expected to increase from 25% (in 1960) to more than 50% by 2020,
  with percentages in some regions far exceeding these averages. These changes
  will bring benefits only if accompanied by increased access to services such
  as sanitation and potable water supplies; they also can lead to serious urban
  environmental problems, including air pollution (e.g., particulates, surface
  ozone, and lead), poor sanitation, and associated problems in water quality
  and potability, if access to services is not improved. </p>
<p>Climate change could affect human health through increases in heat-stress mortality,
  tropical vector-borne diseases, urban air pollution problems, and decreases
  in cold-related illnesses. Compared with the total burden of ill health, these
  problems are not likely to be large. In the aggregate, however, the direct and
  indirect impacts of climate change on human health do constitute a hazard to
  human population health, especially in developing countries in the tropics and
  subtropics; these impacts have considerable potential to cause significant loss
  of life, affect communities, and increase health-care costs and lost work days.
  Model projections (which entail necessary simplifying assumptions) indicate
  that the geographical zone of potential malaria transmission would expand in
  response to global mean temperature increases at the upper part of the IPCC-projected
  range (3-5°C by 2100), increasing the affected proportion of the world's population
  from approximately 45% to approximately 60% by the latter half of the next century.
  Areas where malaria is currently endemic could experience intensified transmission
  (on the order of 50-80 million additional annual cases, relative to an estimated
  global background total of 500 million cases). Some increases in non-vector-borne
  infectious diseases-such as salmonellosis, cholera, and giardiasis-also could
  occur as a result of elevated temperatures and increased flooding. However,
  quantifying the projected health impacts is difficult because the extent of
  climate-induced health disorders depends on other factors-such as migration,
  provision of clean urban environments, improved nutrition, increased availability
  of potable water, improvements in sanitation, the extent of disease vector-control
  measures, changes in resistance of vector organisms to insecticides, and more
  widespread availability of health care. Human health is vulnerable to changes
  in climate-particularly in urban areas, where access to space conditioning may
  be limited, as well as in areas where exposure to vector-borne and communicable
  diseases may increase and health-care delivery and basic services, such as sanitation,
  are poor. </p>
