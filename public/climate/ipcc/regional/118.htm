<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Summer conditions in Europe are warm enough in some countries for native mosquito
  species to transmit malaria. Indeed, until the third quarter of this century,
  the disease was present in southern Europe. Although malaria was successfully
  eradicated from most of Europe during the 1950s and 1960s, there have been recurrent
  outbreaks in Turkey and the former Soviet Union (Bruce-Chwatt and de Zulueta,
  1980), and it is present in parts of North Africa. Different types of malaria
  are present; the severity of symptoms is related to the plasmodia involved.
  The most dangerous form is <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (other species are <i>P.
  vivax</i>, <i>P. ovalum</i>, and <i>P. malariae</i>). Climate change would increase
  the risk of malaria transmission (which currently is low). However, existing
  public-health resources-surface-water management, disease surveillance, and
  medical treatment-would make re-emergent malaria unlikely. Localized outbreaks
  of "airport malaria" may occur (because of increases in tourism, increased malaria
  in countries that Europeans visit, and warmer local conditions in Europe), so
  it is important to strengthen current policies. For example, about 2,000 cases
  of malaria were diagnosed in England in 1990, and there are 10-12 fatalities
  each year. A troublesome trend is the increasing resistance of the plasmodia
  to prophylactics, which increases the chances of disease transmission. </p>
<p>Several existing tick-borne infectious diseases are significant in Europe (e.g.,
  Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, and tick-borne
  viral encephalitis). The tick's life cycle is sensitive to temperature and humidity,
  and tick populations depend on access to intermediate host animal species (especially
  rodents and deer). Unpublished data indicate that an earlier onset of spring
  and a later arrival of the winter season are related to increases in the incidence
  of tick-borne encephalitis in Sweden (Lindgren and Gustafson, submitted). </p>
<p>Leishmaniasis is endemic at a low level in all countries bordering the Mediterranean,
  as well as Portugal (Gradoni et al., 1995). The visceral form of the disease,
  known as kala-azar (which can be fatal), is limited by the distribution of its
  sand fly vectors. Climate change is likely to expand the distribution of the
  sand fly vectors. Higher temperatures also would accelerate the maturation of
  the protozoal parasite, thereby increasing the risk of infection (Rioux et al.,
  1985). </p>
<p>The mosquito <i>Ae. albopictus</i> is considered second only to <i>Ae. aegypti</i>
  in its importance as a disease vector of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever.
  The first sighting of the vector species in Europe (in 1979) came from Albania.
  However, it was only when <i>Ae. albopictus</i> was introduced into Italy in
  1990-through the importation of used tires-and subsequently spread that the
  species was considered a threat to public health. By the end of 1995, <i>Ae.
  albopictus</i> infestations had been reported in 10 Italian regions and 19 provinces.
  Other countries where climatic conditions meet such criteria and that may be
  vulnerable to a potential introduction of <i>Ae. albopictus</i> include Spain,
  Portugal, Greece, Turkey, France, Albania, and the former Republic of Yugoslavia
  (Knudsen et al., 1996). </p>
<p>5) Increases in non-vector-borne infectious diseases also would occur because
  of the effect of higher temperatures on microorganism proliferation. Many food-related
  infections are affected by ambient temperatures and have their annual peaks
  during the summer months (e.g., food poisoning from salmonellosis) (Bentham
  and Langford, 1995). Declining water availability and quality also would pose
  risks to health. Flooding and regional droughts would alter the mix of drinking
  water sources in some locations. Outbreaks of waterborne infectious diseases
  such as cryptosporidiosis-which have occurred in both the United Kingdom and
  the United States in recent years-may become more likely. </p>
<p>6) Climate change also could affect human health indirectly through other impacts.
  For example, a potentially important health impact would result from deterioration
  in social and economic circumstances that might arise from effects of climate
  change on patterns of employment, wealth distribution, and population mobility
  and settlement. </p>
<p>The actual impact of climate change on human health is modulated by the susceptibility
  of the exposed population and the human ability to adapt. In general, the most
  vulnerable populations, communities, or subgroups would be people living in
  poverty or with a high prevalence of malnutrition, chronic exposure to infectious
  disease agents, and inadequate access to social and physical infrastructures.
  Within Europe, in general, the vulnerability to many health impacts is limited
  by existing material resources, public health measures, and systems of health
  care. Heat waves, other forms of extreme weather, airborne respiratory hazards,
  and vector-borne infectious diseases may have an impact, however. </p>
