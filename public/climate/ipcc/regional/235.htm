<h4>8.3.9.4.2. Waterborne diseases </h4>
<p><u>Freshwater</u>: Diarrheal diseases in North America can be caused by a large
  variety of bacteria (e.g., <i>salmonella, shigella</i>, and <i>campylobacter</i>),
  viruses (e.g.,<i> rotavirus</i>), and <i>protozoa</i> (e.g., <i>giardia lamblia</i>,
  <i>toxoplasma</i>, and <i>cryptosporidium</i>). Climatic effects on the distribution
  and quality of surface water, including increases in flooding or water shortages,
  can impede personal hygiene and impair local sewage systems. For example, extreme
  precipitation contributed to an outbreak of <i>toxoplasmosis</i> in British
  Columbia in 1995 when excessive runoff contaminated a reservoir with oocysts
  from domestic and wild cats (British Columbia CDC, writ. comm. 1995). </p>
<p>Cryptosporidiosis, which causes severe diarrhea in children and can be fatal
  to immunocompromised individuals, is the most prevalent waterborne disease in
  the United States (Moore et al., 1995). Natural events (e.g., floods, storms,
  heavy rainfall, and snowmelt) often can wash material of fecal origin, primarily
  from agricultural nonpoint sources, into potable water. The Milwaukee cryptosporidiosis
  outbreak in 1993 resulted in 403,000 reported cases; it coincided with unusually
  heavy spring rains and runoff from melting snow (MacKenzie et al., 1994). </p>
<p>Factors enhancing waterborne cryptosporidiosis will depend on hydrological
  responses to climate change and the degree of flooding in water catchment areas.
  Flushing from heavy rains may be more important than actual flooding, especially
  for private wells influenced by surface water. Land-use patterns also determine
  contamination sources (e.g., agricultural activities) and therefore must be
  considered. </p>
<p>In addition, intensification of heavy rainfall events (as suggested by some
  scenarios) could lead to more rapid leaching from hazardous-waste landfills,
  as well as contamination from agricultural activities and septic tanks. This
  leaching or contamination represents a potential health hazard-particularly
  at times of extensive flooding, which can lead to toxic contamination of groundwater
  or surface drinking water. Improvements in water treatment facilities and technologies
  could help ameliorate this situation. </p>
<p><u>Marine</u>: Warm water favors the growth of toxic organisms such as red
  tides, which cause paralytic shellfish poisoning, diarrheic shellfish poisoning,
  and amnesic shellfish poisoning. For example, one species of toxic algae previously
  confined to the Gulf of Mexico (Gymnodinium breve) extended northward in 1987
  after a "parcel of warm Gulf Stream water" reached far up the east coast, resulting
  in human neurologic shellfish poisonings and substantial fish kills (Tester,
  1991). Domoic acid, a toxin produced by <i>Nitzchia pungens</i> diatom that
  causes amnesic shellfish poisioning, appeared on Prince Edward Island for the
  first time in 1987. The outbreak coincided with an El Niño year, when warm eddies
  of the Gulf Stream neared the shore and heavy rains increased nutrient-rich
  runoff (Hallegraeff, 1993). </p>
<p>Zooplankton, which feed on algae, can serve as reservoirs for <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>
  and other enteric pathogens, particularly gram-negative rods. Quiescent forms
  of <i>V. cholerae</i> have been found to persist within algae; these quiescent
  forms can revert to a culturable (and likely infectious) state when nutrients,
  pH, and temperature permit (Huq et al., 1990). <i>V. cholerae</i> occur in the
  Gulf of Mexico and along the east coast of North America. With warmer sea surface
  temperatures, coastal algal blooms therefore could facilitate cholera proliferation
  and transmission. </p>
