<h1>8.3. Impacts and Adaptation </h1>
<h4>8.3.1. Ecosystems: Nonforest Terrestrial <a name="eco"></a></h4>
<h4>8.3.1.1. Distribution and Sensitivities<a name="dist"></a> </h4>
<p>Nonforest terrestrial ecosystems are the single largest type of land surface
  cover (>51%) in North America. They are extremely diverse and include nontidal
  wetlands (bogs, fens, swamps, and marshes), ecosystems of the polar domain (tundra
  and taiga), traditional rangeland ecosystems (grasslands, deserts, and savannas),
  and improved pastures. These ecosystems are major components of every region
  of North America; they constitute about 80% of the land cover of western North
  America and nearly 100% of the land cover above the 75th parallel. They provide
  forage for 80 million cattle, sheep, and goats and 25 million deer, elk, antelope,
  caribou, and buffalo, as well as most of the breeding and feeding grounds for
  waterfowl in North America (Child and Frasier, 1992; WRI, 1996). Nonforest ecosystems
  are the source of most surface flow and aquifer recharge in the western Great
  Plains and the extreme northern regions of North America. Municipal, agricultural,
  and industrial sectors in these regions depend on nonforest ecosystems for the
  quantity and quality of water required for economic sustainability. The quality
  and quantity of water derived from nonforest ecosystems depend on the management
  these lands receive and the average annual and extreme climatic events they
  encounter. </p>
<p>Nontidal wetlands in North America include a variety of ecosystems such as
  bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, and floodplains. Classification systems are many
  and varied. These wetlands are distributed throughout North America, principally
  in a band extending from the New England states to Alaska. There are additional
  significant areas in the Mississippi Valley, the "Prairie Pothole" region, the
  many coastal wetlands (e.g., the Mississippi River delta, the Everglades, and
  the Okefenokee), the Atlantic coastal marshes and Fraser River estuary, the
  former Great Kankakee and Great Blackwater swamps, the Hudson Bay Lowlands,
  the Peace-Athabasca-Slave delta, the Mackenzie delta, and the Queen Maud Gulf
  on the Arctic Ocean (Mitsch and Gosselink, 1986; Ecological Stratification Working
  Group, 1995; IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 6). See <a href="199.htm">Section 8.3.3</a>
  for a more detailed discussion of wetlands impacts. </p>
<p>Rangelands are characterized by native and introduced vegetation-predominantly
  grasses, grasslike plants, forbs, shrubs, and scattered trees. These lands are
  extremely varied: They include the tallgrass, mixed, and shortgrass prairie
  regions of central North America; tundra and taiga areas in the polar domain;
  annual grasslands of California; chaparral regions of Arizona and California;
  sagebrush shrub steppe and pinyon-juniper woodlands in the intermountain region
  of western North America; and the Chihuahuan, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts in
  the southWestern portion of North America. The associated ecosystems are complex
  and are affected by many interacting biotic and abiotic components, and their
  health depends on the interaction of climate, soils, species competition, fire,
  grazing, and management. These ecosystems provide a wide array of goods and
  services, including forage, water, and habitat for wildlife and domesticated
  livestock and open space for recreational activities, and they are the source
  of many of the raw materials needed to sustain our industrial society (i.e.,
  pharmaceuticals, precious metals, minerals, construction materials, natural
  gas, oil, and coal) (Heady and Child, 1994). </p>
<p>Although some rangelands are fragile and easily disturbed by anthropogenic
  activity (Belnap, 1995), others are resistant to change. Semi-arid and arid
  ecosystems are considered among the most sensitive because these ecosystems
  often are water-limited and have marginal nutrient reserves (OIES, 1991; IPCC
  1996, WG II, Chapter 2). </p>
<p>Current levels of uncertainties associated with the functioning and adaptive
  capacity of nonforest ecosystems under variable and changing climate and the
  possibility of critical thresholds limit our ability to identify the relative
  sensitivities of these ecosystems (and the potential impacts of changing climates).
  It is understood, however, that these ecosystems are sensitive to climate variability
  and that the impacts can vary depending on the resilience and resistance of
  the ecosystem to the stresses applied (e.g., changes in precipitation, CO<sub>2</sub>,
  temperature, fire, land use, and land cover and management). Researchers also
  believe that the impacts of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment and shifts in temperature and precipitation
  regimes are likely to be greatest when they are reinforced by other destabilizing
  forces. Lack of information about how these other factors interact with climate
  change also limits our understanding of ecosystem response. Also of concern
  are the relative sensitivities of species at the ecotones between vegetation
  types, such as between grasslands and woodlands and between woodlands and forests
  (Polley, 1997). </p>
