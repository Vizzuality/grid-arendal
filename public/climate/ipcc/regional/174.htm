<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Within the North American region (defined for the purposes of this report as
  the portion of continental North America south of the Arctic Circle and north
  of the U.S.-Mexico border), vulnerability to climate change varies significantly
  from sector to sector and from subregion to subregion. Recognition of this variability
  or subregional "texture" is important in understanding the potential effects
  of climate change on North America and in formulating viable response strategies.
</p>
<p>The characteristics of the subregions and sectors of North America suggest
  that neither the impacts of climate change nor the response options will be
  uniform. This assessment suggests that there will be differences in the impacts
  of climate change across the region and within particular sectors. In fact,
  simply considering the relative climate sensitivity of different sectors or
  systems within a particular subregion (i.e., climate-sensitive, climate-insensitive,
  or climate-limited) would suggest differentiated impacts. This diversity also
  is reflected in the available response options. Sectors and subregions will
  need to adopt response options to alleviate negative impacts or take advantage
  of opportunities that not only address the impacts but are tailored to the needs
  and characteristics of that subregion. </p>
<p>Comprising most of Canada and the contiguous United States, this large area
  is diverse in terms of its geological, ecological, climatic, and socioeconomic
  structures. Temperature extremes range from well below -40°C in northern latitudes
  during the winter months to greater than +40°C in southern latitudes during
  the summer. The regional atmospheric circulation is governed mainly by upper-level
  westerly winds and subtropical weather systems, with tropical storms occasionally
  impacting on the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts during summer and autumn.
  The Great Plains (including the Canadian Prairies) and southeastern U.S. experience
  more severe weather-in the form of thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hail-than any
  other region of the world. </p>
<p>Our current understanding of the potential impacts of climate change is limited
  by critical uncertainties. One important uncertainty relates to the inadequacy
  of regional-scale climate projections relative to the spatial scales of variability
  in North American natural and human systems. This uncertainty is compounded
  further by the uncertainties inherent in ecological, economic, and social models-which
  thereby further limit our ability to identify the full extent of impacts or
  prescriptive adaptation measures. Given these uncertainties, particularly the
  inability to forecast futures, conclusions about regional impacts are not yet
  reliable and are limited to the sensitivity and vulnerability of physical, biological,
  and socioeconomic systems to climate change and climate variability. </p>
<p>Within most natural and human systems in North America, current climate-including
  its variability-frequently is a limiting factor. Climate, however, is only one
  of many factors that determine the overall condition of these systems. For example,
  projected population changes in North America and associated changes in land
  use and air and water quality will continue to put pressure on natural ecosystems
  (e.g., rangelands, wetlands, and coastal ecosystems). Projected changes in climate
  should be seen as an additional factor that can influence the health and existence
  of these ecosystems. In some cases, changes in climate will provide adaptive
  opportunities or could alleviate the pressure of multiple stresses; in other
  cases, climate change could hasten or broaden negative impacts, leading to reduced
  function or elimination of ecosystems. </p>
<p>Virtually all sectors within North America are vulnerable to climate change
  to some degree in some subregions. Although many sectors and regions are sensitive
  to climate change, the technological capability to adapt to climate change is
  readily available, for the most part. If appropriate adaptation strategies are
  identified and implemented in a timely fashion, the overall vulnerability of
  the region may be reduced. However, uncertainties exist about the feasibility
  of implementation and efficacy of technological adaptation. </p>
<p>Even when current adaptive capability has been factored in, long-lived natural
  forest ecosystems in the east and interior west; water resources in the southern
  plains; agriculture in the southeast and southern plains; human health in areas
  currently experiencing diminished urban air quality; northern ecosystems and
  habitats; estuarine beaches in developed areas; and low-latitude cold-water
  fisheries will remain among the most vulnerable sectors and regions. West coast
  coniferous forests; some western rangelands; energy costs for heating in the
  northern latitudes; salting and snow clearance costs; open-water season in northern
  channels and ports; and agriculture in the northern latitudes, the interior
  west, and west coast may benefit from opportunities associated with warmer temperatures
  or potentially from carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fertilization. </p>
<p>The availability of better information on the potential impacts of climate
  change and the interaction of these impacts with other important factors that
  influence the health and productivity of natural and human systems is critical
  to providing the lead time necessary to take full advantage of opportunities
  for minimizing or adapting to impacts, as well as for allowing adequate opportunity
  for the development of the necessary institutional and financial capacity to
  manage change. </p>
<p><b>Key Impacts to Physical, Biological, and Socioeconomic Systems</b></p>
<p><b>Ecosystems: Nonforest Terrestrial</b> (<a href="187.htm#eco">Section 8.3.1</a>).<br>
  The composition and geographic distribution of many ecosystems will shift as
  individual species respond to changes in climate. There will likely be reductions
  in biological diversity and in the goods and services that nonforest terrestrial
  ecosystems provide to society.</p>
<p><i>Increased temperatures could reduce sub-arctic (i.e., tundra and taiga/tundra)
  ecosystems. Loss of migratory wildfowl and mammal breeding and forage habitats
  may occur within the taiga/tundra, which is projected to nearly disappear from
  mainland areas.</i> This ecozone currently is the home of the majority of the
  Inuit population. It also provides the major breeding and nesting grounds for
  a variety of migratory birds and the major summer range and calving grounds
  for Canada's largest caribou herd, as well as habitat for a number of ecologically
  significant plant and animal species critical to the subsistence lifestyles
  of the indigenous peoples. Current biogeographic model projections suggest that
  tundra and taiga/tundra ecosystems may be reduced by as much as two-thirds of
  their present size, reducing the regional storage of carbon in the higher latitudes
  of North America-which may shift the tundra region from a net sink to a net
  source of CO<sub>2</sub> for the tundra region. </p>
<p><i>The relatively certain northward shift of the southern boundary of permafrost
  areas (projected to be about 500 km by the middle of the 21st century) will
  impact ecosystems, infrastructure, and wildlife in the altered areas through
  terrain slumping, increased sediment loadings to rivers and lakes, and dramatically
  altered hydrology; affected peatlands could become sources rather than sinks
  for atmospheric carbon</i>. Projections suggest that peatlands may disappear
  from south of 60°N in the Mackenzie Basin; patchy arctic wetlands currently
  supported by surface flow also may not persist. </p>
<p><i>Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations may alter the nitrogen cycle, drought survival
  mechanisms (e.g., the rate of depletion of soil water by grasses), and fire
  frequency-potentially decreasing forage quality and impacting forage production
  on rangelands</i>. Increases in CO<sub>2</sub> and changes in regional climate could exacerbate
  the existing problem of loss of production on western rangelands related to
  woody and noxious plant invasions by accelerating the invasion of woody C<sub>3</sub> plants
  (many crop and tree species) into mostly C<sub>4</sub> (tropical grasses, many weed species
  ) grasslands. Mechanisms include changes in water-use efficiency (WUE), the
  nitrogen cycle (increase in carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and concentrations of unpalatable
  and toxic substances), drought survival mechanisms, and fire frequency. Growth
  and reproduction of individual animals could decrease as CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations
  rise, without dietary supplementation. However, the data are ambiguous, and
  production may increase in some grassland ecosystems. Uncertainty exists in
  our ability to predict ecosystem or individual species responses to elevated
  CO<sub>2</sub> and global warming at either the regional or global scale. </p>
<p><i>Arid lands may increase</i>. Current biogeographical model simulations indicate
  up to a 200% increase in leaf area index in the desert southWest region of North
  America and a northern migration and expansion of arid-land species into the
  Great Basin region of North America. Although uncertainty exists in predictions
  of regional climate changes and simulations of ecosystem responses to elevated
  CO<sub>2</sub> and global warming, long-term change in ecosystem structure and function
  is suggested. </p>
<p><i>Landslides and debris flows in unstable Rocky Mountain areas and possibly
  elsewhere could become more common</i> as winter wet precipitation increases,
  permafrost degrades, and/or glaciers retreat. Water quality would be affected
  by increased sediment loads. Fish and wildlife habitat, as well as roads and
  other artificial structures, could be at increased risk. </p>
