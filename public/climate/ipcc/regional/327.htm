  leaves</p>
<p><b>succession</b> transition in the composition of plant communities following
  disturbance </p>
<p><b>susceptibility</b> probability for an individual or population of being
  affected by an external factor</p>
<p><b>sustainable</b> a term used to characterize human action that can be undertaken
  in such a manner as to not adversely affect environmental conditions (e.g.,
  soil, water quality, climate) that are necessary to support those same activities
  in the future</p>
<p><b>symbionts</b> organisms that live together to mutual benefit [e.g., nitrogen-fixing
  bacteria that live with a plant (legume)] </p>
<p><b>synoptic</b> relating to or displaying atmospheric and weather conditions
  as they exist simultaneously over a broad area</p>
<p><b>taiga</b> coniferous forests of northern North America and Eurasia</p>
<p><b>talik</b> a layer of unfrozen ground occurring between permafrost and the
  active layer</p>
<p><b>technical calorie</b> the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature
  of 1 g of water 1�C at 15�C </p>
<p><b>thermohaline circulation</b> circulation driven by density gradients, which
  are controlled by temperature and salinity</p>
<p><b>thermokarst</b> irregular, hummocky topography in frozen ground caused by
  melting of ice </p>
<p><b>thermophilic species</b> species growing at high temperatures</p>
<p><b>timberline</b> the upper limit of tree growth in mountains or high latitudes</p>
<p><b>transpiration</b> the emission of water vapor from the surfaces of leaves
  or other plant parts</p>
<p><b>tsunami </b>a large tidal wave produced by a submarine earthquake, landslide,
  or volcanic eruption </p>
<p><b>ungulate</b> a hoofed typically herbivorous quadruped mammal (as a ruminant,
  swine, camel, hippopotamus, horse, tapir, rhinoceros, elephant, or hyrax) </p>
<p><b>upwelling</b> transport of deeper water to the surface, usually caused by
  horizontal movements of surface water</p>
<p><b>urbanization</b> the conversion of land from a natural state or managed
  natural state (such as agriculture) to cities</p>
<p><b>vector</b> an organism, such as an insect, that transmits a pathogen from
  one host to another</p>
<p><b>vernalization</b> the act or process of hastening the flowering and fruiting
  of plants by treating seeds, bulbs, or seedlings so as to induce a shortening
  of the vegetative period</p>
<p><b>vulnerability</b> the extent to which climate change may damage or harm
  a system; it depends not only on a system's sensitivity, but also on its ability
  to adapt to new climatic conditions </p>
<p><b>wadi </b>a water course that is dry except during the rainy season; the
  stream or flush that runs through it</p>
<p><b>water-use efficiency</b> carbon gain in photosynthesis per unit water lost
  in evapotranspiration; can be expressed on a short-term basis as the ratio of
  photosynthetic carbon gain per unit transpirational water loss, or on a seasonal
  basis as the ratio of net primary production or agricultural yield to the amount
  of available water</p>
<p><b>winter dormancy</b> period without biochemical activity in plant tissues
</p>
<p><b>xeric</b> requiring only a small amount of moisture</p>
<p><b>xerophyte</b> a plant structurally adapted for life and growth with a limited
  water supply, especially by means of mechanisms that limit transpiration or
  that provide for the storage of water</p>
