<p>According to climate change projections, approximately 70% of the current temperate
  forest in Mexico could be affected by climate change (Villers, 1995). Other
  vulnerability studies (Gay-García and Ruiz Suarez, 1996), carried out on the
  basis of CCC-J1 GCMs (Boer et al., 1992; Boer, 1993; McFarlane et al., 1992;
  GDFL-A3, Wetherald and Manabe, 1988), suggest that 10% of all vegetation types
  in northern Mexico's ecosystems-including forests and shrublands of southern
  Chihuahua, eastern Coahuila, northern Zacatecas, and San Luis Potosí-would be
  affected by drier and warmer conditions, resulting in the expansion of dry and
  very dry tropical forests and xerophytic shrublands. Changes in precipitation
  intensity and seasonality are likely to have larger impacts on the future composition
  and distribution of Costa Rican and Nicaraguan forests than annual temperature
  changes alone (Halpin et al., 1995a,b). About 35 million ha in Venezuela have
  been projected to change from subtropical forest to tropical forest, and 40-50
  million ha could shift from moist to dry or very dry forest by the time atmospheric
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration doubles, according to studies performed on the basis of scenarios
  derived from a number of models: GFDL (Manabe and Wetherald, 1987), GISS (Hansen
  et al., 1984), OSU (Schlesinger and Zhao, 1989), and UKMO-H2 (Mata, 1996; Mitchell
  and Warrilow, 1987). </p>
<p>In Bolivia, forests cover about 53.4 million ha (48% of the national territory).
  The deforestation rate over a period of 18 years has been estimated to be on
  the order of 168,000 ha per year, as a result of the expansion of agricultural
  frontiers and the selective extraction of species with high commercial value.
  Changes in Bolivian forest characteristics resulting from climate change have
  been assessed on the bases of Holdridge's model, and on the GISS-G1 (Hansen
  et al., 1984) and UKMO-H3 (Mitchell et al., 1989) GCMs, assuming a doubling
  of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The resulting projections indicate reductions in humid
  subtropical forests (86.6% under GISS-G1, 95% under UKMO-H3), and expansions
  of humid tropical forests (61.8% under GISS-G1, 8.9% under UKMO-H3) (Tejada
  Miranda, 1996). </p>
<p>Middle- to high-latitude forests would be more strongly affected by temperature
  than tropical and subtropical forests; they also are believed to be more sensitive
  to the speed of climate change than to its magnitude (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
  1.5). In Latin America, therefore, climate warming per se should have its greatest
  impact on the Austral forests of southern Chile and Argentina, especially at
  their northern boundaries with other ecosystem types. </p>
<p>The foregoing information has very important implications for governments,
  local communities, and other stakeholders in Latin American countries: It is
  apparent that the consideration of feedbacks between changes in climate and
  land-use practices is essential in the design of sustainable development policies.
  The study of linkages between the present climate and projected climate, in
  the context of seasonal-to-interannual variability, is the first step in this
  design process. </p>
