<p><u>Encephalitides</u>: Of reported encephalitis cases in North America, many
  are mosquito related, including Saint Louis encephalitis, which has occurred
  as far north as Windsor, Ontario (1975); LaCrosse encephalitis; and western,
  eastern, and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (Shope, 1980). The elderly
  are at highest risk for Saint Louis encephalitis, and children under 16 years
  are at greatest risk of LaCrosse encephalitis. </p>
<p>Although mosquito longevity diminishes as temperatures rise, viral transmission
  rates (similar to dengue) rise sharply at higher temperatures (see <a href="233.htm#figure8-11">Figure
  8-11</a>) (Hardy, 1988; Reisen et al., 1993). From field studies in California
  (Reeves et al., 1994), researchers have suggested that a 3-5�C temperature increase
  could cause a northern shift in western equine and Saint Louis encephalitis
  outbreaks, with the disappearance of western equine encephalitis in southern
  endemic regions. Also to be considered in these types of impact assessments
  is the impact of projected climate change on mosquito habitat (e.g., freshwater
  hardwood swamps for the eastern equine encephalomyelitis vector <i>Culiseta
  melanura</i>-which may well be eliminated from the southeast United States).
</p>
<p>Outbreaks of Saint Louis encephalitis are correlated with periods of several
  consecutive days in which temperature exceeds 30�C (Monath and Tsai, 1987).
  For example, the 1984 California epidemic followed a period of extremely high
  temperatures. In addition, eastern equine encephalitis has been associated with
  warm, wet summers along the east coast of the United States (Freier, 1993).
  Computer analysis of monthly climate data has demonstrated that excessive rainfall
  in January and February, combined with drought in July, most often precedes
  outbreaks of eastern equine encephalitis (Bowen and Francy, 1980). Such a pattern
  of warm, wet winters followed by hot, dry summers resembles many of the GCM
  projections for climate change over much of the United States. </p>
<p><u>Tickborne diseases:</u> Ticks transmit Lyme disease-the most common vector-borne
  disease in the United States, with more than 10,000 cases reported in 1994-along
  with Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), and Ehrlichiosis. Involved tick and
  mammal host populations are influenced by land use and land cover, soil type,
  and elevation, as well as the timing, duration, and rate of change of temperature
  and moisture regimes (Mount et al., 1993; Glass et al., 1994). The relationships
  between vector life-stage parameters and climatic conditions have been verified
  experimentally in field and laboratory studies (Goddard, 1992; Mount et al.,
  1993). Ixodes scapularis-an important hard-backed tick vector in North America-will
  not deposit eggs at temperatures below 8�C, and larvae will not emerge from
  eggs at temperatures below 12�C; the nymphal molt requires approximately 35
  days at 25�C, and the adult molt requires 45 days at 25�C. Temperature also
  affects the activity of ticks; a minimum threshold for activity is 4�C. Ticks
  also are highly dependent on a humid environment. Climate change, therefore,
  could be expected to alter the distribution of these diseases in both the United
  States and Canada (Grant, 1991; Canadian Global Change Program, 1995; Environment
  Canada et al., 1995; Hancock, 1997). For example, any tendency toward drying
  would suggest a reduction in the incidence of these diseases. </p>
