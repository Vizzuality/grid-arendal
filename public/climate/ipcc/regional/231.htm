<h4>8.3.9.2. Air Quality and Ground-Level Ozone </h4>
<p><i>Projected climate changes could lead to exacerbation of respiratory disorders
  associated with reduced air quality in urban and rural areas and effects on
  the seasonality of certain allergic respiratory disorders. </i></p>
<p>It is well established that exposure to single or combined air pollutants has
  serious public health consequences. For example, ozone at ground level has been
  identified as causing damage to lung tissue, particularly among the elderly
  and children-reducing pulmonary function and sensitizing airways to other irritants
  and allergens (Beckett, 1991; Schwartz, 1994; U.S. EPA, 1996). Ground-level
  ozone affects not only those with impaired respiratory function, such as persons
  with asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease, but also healthy individuals.
  Even at relatively low exposure levels, healthy individuals can experience chest
  pain, coughing, nausea, and pulmonary congestion as a result of exposure to
  ground-level ozone. </p>
<p>Researchers also recognize that concurrent hot weather and air pollution can
  have synergistic impacts on health (Katsouyanni et al., 1993). For example,
  warmer temperatures can accelerate production and increase concentrations of
  photochemical oxidants in urban and rural areas and thus exacerbate respiratory
  disorders (Shumway et al., 1988; Schwartz and Dockery, 1992; Dockery et al.,
  1993; Katsouyanni et al., 1993; Pope et al., 1995; Phelps, 1996). </p>
<p>Few large-scale studies have been performed to assess the implications of climate
  change on air quality or population exposures to high concentrations of ground-level
  ozone. This limitation is related to difficulty in devising a defensible scenario
  of future climate change for a specific location, the previous focus on acute
  short-term effects rather than long-term effects, and the expense involved in
  modeling atmospheric chemistry. There is a limited number of studies, however,
  that shed some light on possible impacts of climate change on air quality and
  associated health implications. </p>
<p>Emberlin (1994), for example, has suggested that global warming may affect
  the seasonality of certain allergic respiratory disorders by altering the production
  of plant aero-allergens. Asthma and hay fever can be triggered by aero-allergens
  that cause high seasonal morbidity. The severity of allergies may be intensified
  by projected changes in heat and humidity, thereby contributing to breathing
  difficulties (Environment Canada et al., 1995; Maarouf, 1995). </p>
<p>Ozone concentrations at ground level continue to be the most pervasive air
  pollution problem in North America. The U.S. population exposed to unhealthy
  levels of ozone has fluctuated over the past 10-20 years-reaching a peak in
  1988, when 112 million people lived in areas with higher than acceptable concentrations.
  In addition, recent studies (U.S. EPA, 1996) provide evidence of a positive
  correlation between ground-level ozone and respiratory-related hospital admissions
  in several cities in the United States. Such hospital admissions in the province
  of Ontario strongly relate to ambient levels of sulfur dioxide and ozone and
  to temperature (Canadian Public Health Association, 1992). </p>
<p>Research has shown that ground-level ozone formation is affected by weather
  and climate. Many studies have focused on the relationship between temperature
  and ozone concentrations (Wolff and Lioy, 1978; Atwater, 1984; Kuntasal and
  Chang, 1987; Wackter and Bayly, 1988; Wakim, 1989). For example, the large increase
  in ozone concentrations at ground level in 1988 in the United States and in
  parts of southern Canada can be attributed, in part, to meteorological conditions;
  1988 was the third-hottest summer in the past 100 years. In general, the aforementioned
  studies suggest a nonlinear relationship between temperature and ozone concentrations
  at ground level: Below temperatures of 22-26°C (70-80°F), there is no relationship
  between ozone concentrations and temperature; above 32°C (90°F), there is a
  strong positive relationship. </p>
<p>Regression analyses have revealed that high temperatures are a necessary condition
  for high ozone concentrations at ground level; other meteorological variables
  often need to be considered, however. Weather variables that have been included
  in regression equations include temperature, wind speed, relative humidity,
  and sky cover (Wakim, 1990; Korsog and Wolff, 1991); however, other variables
  that could be included are wind direction, dew-point temperature, sea-level
  pressure, and precipitation. </p>
<p>Studies of ground-level ozone concentrations in which emissions and other weather
  factors are held constant (Smith and Tirpak, 1989) suggest the following impacts
  on ground-level ozone as a result of a 4°C warming: </p>
<ul>
  <li>In the San Francisco Bay area, maximum ozone concentration could increase
    by about 20% and could approximately double the area that would be out of
    compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS).</li>
  <li>In New York, ground-level ozone concentrations could increase by 4%.</li>
  <li>In the Midwest and Southeast, changes in ground-level ozone levels could
    range from a decrease of 2.4% to an increase of 8%, and the area in exceedance
    of the ozone standard could exhibit nearly a threefold increase.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Canada, a projected fivefold rise in the frequency of hot days (i.e., those
  with temperatures >30°C) could lead to a greater number of days with levels
  of ground-level ozone considered to be a health risk for sensitive individuals
  in the population (Environment Canada et al., 1995). </p>
