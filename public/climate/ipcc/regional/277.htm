<h4>10.2.6.3. Pollution Hazards </h4>
<p>Experiments by Hatakeyama et al. (1991) showed that the higher temperatures
  are, the faster ground-level ozone forms and the longer high concentrations
  of ozone last. Therefore, global warming would accelerate the photochemical
  reaction rates among chemical pollutants in the atmosphere, increasing oxidants
  in many urban areas. High levels of photochemical oxidants are associated with
  eye irritation, severe respiratory irritation, increased frequency of asthmatic
  attacks of susceptible persons, and decreased pulmonary functions (Ando, 1993).

<h1>10.3. Integrated Analysis of Potential Vulnerabilities and Impacts<a name="inte"></a>
</h1>
<h4>10.3.1. North China<a name="nchina"></a> </h4>
<p>North China-including Beijing, Tianjin, the four provinces (Hebei, Henan, Shandong,
  Shanxi), parts of Anhui province, and parts of inner Mongolia-is an economic
  center of China. It also is a topographical and climatological entity. Its population
  is 371 million, and its area is 76.5 million ha, including 28.9 million ha of
  cultivated land. Because this region already is at risk from normal climate
  variability, it also is likely to be quite vulnerable to long-term secular shifts.
  The concept of regions at risk is used here to focus on four different managed
  ecosystems: water resources, agriculture, forests, and coastal zones. </p>
<h4>10.3.1.1. Water Resources<a name="water"></a> </h4>
<p>Water resources in north China are sensitive and vulnerable to climate change
  because: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Water resource availability in this area amounts to merely 500 m<sup>3</sup> per capita-half
    the critical value of the United Nations (UN) standard (1,000 m<sup>3</sup> per capita)
    for maintaining socioeconomic and environmental development. </li>
  <li>There already is a high level of water project development in this region.
    For example, in the Haihe basin, the ratio of water supply to total runoff
    has reached 0.87, but the ratio of water demand to total runoff already is
    1.32. Because of the shortage of surface runoff for meeting water demand,
    depletion of groundwater resources is very serious.</li>
  <li>Depending on the different scenarios used for GCMs, changes in runoff could
    range between -16% and +7%; these shifts would occur mainly during the flood
    season. Such changes could unfavorably affect reservoir capability for storage
    and flood control. Although water shortages resulting from climate change
    are likely to be less important than those caused by population growth, economic
    development, and urbanization (for example, in the Hailuang River basin, water
    shortages resulting from climate change are projected to be about 6.9-9.5
    billion m<sup>3</sup>, whereas shortages from other factors are projected to be 25.2-47.8
    billion m<sup>3</sup>), the potential water deficiency due to climate change in moderately
    and extremely dry years may seriously exacerbate the current water shortage-and
    thus badly affect socioeconomic development in this region.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trends of runoff for north China under four GCM scenarios are shown in <a href="#table10-9">Table
  10-9</a>. (At its lower reach, the Huanghe is elevated above its neighboring
  lands.) Both surface water and groundwater in north China seem to be quite sensitive
  to climatic variability, especially on the Huang-Hai plain, according to the
  model results. Under these scenarios, climate change will result in an additional
  shortfall of 0.15-1.4 billion m<sup>3</sup> of water in the Jing-Jin-Tang subregion, which
  would cause economic losses of US$50-800 million (constant 1990 values) in a
  normal year and US$230-2,270 million in a very dry year. <br>
