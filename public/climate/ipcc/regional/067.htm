<h4>4.3.1.3. Terrestrial Ecosystems </h4>
<p>Predictions based on scenarios of climate change suggest increased variability
  and unpredictability in productivity and community composition. Any changes
  that might occur in the location and seasonal patterns of rainfall and in ENSO
  characteristics would result in significant impacts and vulnerability (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 2.7.2 and Boxes 2.2 and 2.8). Although migration to more
  suitable climatic regimes is an option for some biota (Mitchell and Williams,
  1996), ecosystems are not expected to shift en masse. Differential rates of
  migration and survival of different species will inevitably change the abundance
  and distribution of species, community structure, and possibly ecosystem function
  at any given location. Altered species interactions-for example, predation,
  parasitism, and competition-also are likely and may eliminate formerly successful
  species even if the climate remains within their physiological tolerances (Peters,
  1992). Ecosystems whose "keystone" species are particularly sensitive to climate
  will be more at risk. (A keystone species is one that has a central servicing
  role affecting many other organisms and whose demise is likely to result in
  the loss of a number of species and lead to major changes in ecosystem function.)
  Some species will be slow to migrate because of factors such as slow reproduction
  rate or limited seed dispersal mechanisms (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 1.3.5);
  species with better capacity for dispersal and establishment, including weeds,
  will have an advantage. Disruption in forest composition is most likely to occur
  where fragmentation of the forest reduces the potential for dispersal of new,
  more suitable species (Whitehead et al., 1992). Although many species will be
  able to adapt, climate change is expected to reduce biodiversity in individual
  ecosystems overall (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 1.3.6). </p>
<p>Rising temperatures can be accommodated by moves toward higher elevations (if
  the terrain allows) because air temperature decreases by about 1ï¿½C for every
  100-200 m increase in elevation (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 5.2.3.3), or toward
  higher latitudes because temperatures generally decline as one moves poleward,
  especially in mid-latitudes. However, elevational migration is not an option
  for most of Australia's predominantly flat expanses, and latitudinal migration
  is a limited option in parts of tropical Australia where the latitudinal variation
  of temperature is small and poleward migration is limited by desert or land-use
  change; here the biota will increasingly experience temperatures never previously
  encountered. In contrast to North America and Eurasia, the oceanic boundary
  of southern Australia will restrict the poleward migration of terrestrial biota.
  Small offshore islands and mountain tops provide limited migration options,
  and escarpments, deserts, agricultural land, and urban areas present physical
  barriers to migration. Conversely, changes in climate thresholds, such as frost,
  may remove an existing limitation to species survival and performance. The survival
  of vulnerable species in refugia, particularly during drought, and then expansion
  into adjacent areas (e.g., Morton et al., 1995) suggest that migration will
  be even more limited if there are increases in the frequency or intensity of
  climatic extremes such as drought. </p>
<p>More than half of the region comprises the arid and semi-arid ecosystems of
  grasslands, shrublands, and savanna. These areas exhibit a high degree of spatial
  variation, from small-scale variation in water and soils to larger-scale variation
  in climate patterns. In such rangeland ecosystems, the amount and timing of
  rainfall and nutrient limitations are the major determinants of plant community
  composition, distribution, and productivity (Mott et al., 1985; IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Section 2.1). Possible increases in rainfall intensity with climate change
  would increase the proportion of rain that runs off particular landscape elements
  and runs onto others, resulting in changes in the temporal and spatial functioning
  of rangelands (Stafford Smith et al., 1994). In general, rangelands are not
  in equilibrium but fluctuate between states according to rainfall, fire, grazing,
  and other factors (Westoby et al., 1989; IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 2.1). They
  have adapted to the naturally high variation of rainfall associated with their
  low mean rainfall and ENSO-related interannual variability. Should ecosystem
  productivity and composition become more variable and unpredictable-as has been
  suggested by some climate change studies-then land management issues, such as
  the type of grazing activity, the use of fire for woody weed control, and pest
  animal management, will become more important (Stafford Smith et al., 1994).
</p>
<p>The responses of animals to climate change will be partly determined by the
  response of co-occurring plants and habitat. For example, migratory species
  may be affected by reduction of suitable habitats along their migration routes.
  Thermal stress, which is particularly evident in animals in a variety of Australian
  ecosystems (Nix, 1982), may affect the geographic range and the reproductive
  biology of species. Indeed, contractions in core climatic habitat were shown
  for more than 80% of threatened vertebrate species in Australia under three
  climate change scenarios based on CSIRO (1992) (Dexter et al., 1995). Although
  some animal species may be physically capable of moving great distances, behavioral
  traits may restrict dispersal options (Peters, 1992). As with plants, animals
  that are less adaptable, less mobile, or physically restricted (such as fish
  in lakes) may decline or become extinct. </p>
<p>Forest and woodland are reported to cover 19% of Australia and 28% of New Zealand
  (WRI, 1996). Indigenous forests occupy nearly a quarter of New Zealand, mainly
  under conservation control and often in mountain lands. The slowly maturing
  trees of indigenous forests will be more vulnerable than other plants to long-term
  external change. </p>
<p>Alpine ecosystems in Australia, which occupy only a small area, have been identified
  as being particularly susceptible to climate change (Busby, 1988; Nias, 1992;
  Brereton et al., 1995). Upslope areas required to cope with the predicted rise
  in temperatures may not be available for many of these ecosystems. In small
  alpine streams, any increase in water temperatures and reduction in water flow
  could be stressful for alpine stream animals. Model studies for Australian mountain
  vegetation show that there is potential for the expansion of woody vegetation
  and shrub communities, as well as rises in treelines (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
  5.2.3.4). </p>
<p>Pests, weeds, and diseases play significant roles in Australian and New Zealand
  ecosystems (and agriculture). The geographical distribution and severity of
  their impacts on host plants and ecosystems could be dramatically changed by
  the combination of changes in climate, atmospheric composition, and habitat
  (Sutherst et al., 1996). For example, any changes in the timing and intensity
  of plant moisture stress will bring changes in the relative advantage of different
  types of herbivorous insects. </p>
<p>Fire plays an important role in the composition, function, and dynamics of
  many Australian ecosystems (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 1.5.1). For example, the
  importance of the length of inter-fire interval has been repeatedly demonstrated
  (Christensen and Kimber, 1975; Burgman and Lamont, 1992; Gill and Bradstock,
  1995; Morrison et al., 1995; Keith, 1996). It has been strongly suggested that
  the risk of fire may increase as the climate changes (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
  1.3.1) because of factors such as higher temperatures and water stress-though
  there remains much speculation about future fire regimes owing to the uncertainty
  associated with the many climatic and ecosystem variables involved (Williams
  and Gill, 1995). If fires become more frequent under climate change (Beer and
  Williams, 1995; Pittock et al., 1997), species composition and structure could
  be altered, at least in southern Australia. Changes in other components of the
  fire regime, such as intensity (which could be affected by changes in fuel loading)
  and season, likewise could affect species diversity. Any increased fire occurrence
  also could present increased risks to people and infrastructure in forested
  urban fringe areas of southeastern Australia. </p>
