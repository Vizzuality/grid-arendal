<h4>8.3.8.2. Recreation and Tourism </h4>
<p>Climate creates opportunities and limitations for outdoor recreation. It is
  a major influence on the economic viability of some recreation enterprises.
  Several studies have projected shorter North American skiing seasons as a result
  of climate change. In a study of the implications of an effective CO<sub>2</sub> doubling
  on tourism and recreation in Ontario, Canada, Wall (1988) projected that the
  downhill ski season in the South Georgian Bay region could be eliminated. This
  outcome assumed a temperature rise of 3.5-5.7�C and a 9% increase in annual
  precipitation levels. Some of these losses would be offset by an extended summer
  recreational season. Lamothe and P�riard (1988) examined the implications of
  a 4-5�C temperature rise throughout the downhill skiing season in Quebec. They
  projected a 50-70% decrease in the number of ski days in southern Quebec; ski
  resorts equipped with snowmaking devices probably would experience a 40-50%
  reduction in the number of ski days. This change in winter recreational traffic
  would have direct implications for road traffic (down) and requirements for
  snow-removal and road repair (also probably down). On the other hand, Masterton
  et al. (1976) have noted that low temperatures are a limiting factor on recreation
  activity in the northern part of the prairie provinces. The summer recreation
  season in many areas may be extended (Masterton et al., 1976; Staple and Wall,
  1994). Warmer temperatures may offset some of the costs of sea-level rise for
  recreational barrier islands. </p>
<h4>8.3.8.3. Extreme Weather Events<a name="extreme"></a> </h4>
<p><i>Human settlements and infrastructure are especially vulnerable to several
  types of extreme weather events, including droughts, intense precipitation,
  extreme temperature episodes, high winds, and severe storms. Hence, there could
  be impacts should the frequency or intensity of these extreme events increase
  or decrease with climate warming. </i></p>
<p>Weather-related natural disasters (wildfires, hurricanes, severe storms, ice,
  snow, flooding, drought, tornadoes, and other extreme weather events) are estimated
  to have caused damages in the United States averaging about $39 billion per
  year during the years 1992-96 (FEMA, 1997). Those losses included damages to
  structures (buildings, bridges, roads, etc.) and losses of income, property,
  and other indirect consequences. </p>
<p>As indicated in <a href="186.htm">Section 8.2.3</a> and IPCC (1996, WG I, Section
  6.5), the ability to predict changes in the frequency or intensity of extreme
  weather events using global and regional models has been limited by their lack
  of small-scale spatial and temporal resolution and uncertainties about representation
  of some processes.<sup><a href="fn8.htm#3">3</a></sup> Historical changes in
  frequencies of extreme events also provide some insights on possible changes,
  but there is debate about which changes are significant and which are unambiguously
  attributable to climate warming. However, some indications of directions of
  change have been inferred from observations and model simulations for North
  America, particularly regarding increased variability of precipitation. Beyond
  those inferences, a number of vulnerabilities of resources to extreme events
  have been identified should such events increase in frequency or magnitude.
  Conversely, decreases in extreme events could reduce levels of damages currently
  experienced. Additional research is needed to better understand the sensitivity
  and vulnerabilities of North American human settlements and infrastructure to
  extreme events, including factors beyond climate that are changing those vulnerabilities.
</p>
<p><i>Flooding may be a very important impact because of the large amount of property
  and human life potentially at risk in North America, as is evident from historical
  disasters. There have been relatively few studies addressing the change in risk
  directly because of the lack of credible climate change scenarios at the level
  of detail necessary to predict flooding.</i> </p>
<p>The evidence for an increasing trend in warm-period rainfall intensities in
  the United States (discussed in <a href="184.htm">Section 8.2.2</a>) suggests
  the potential for a shift in the periodicity of the flood regime in North America.
  More frequent or more extreme flooding could cause considerable disruption of
  transportation and water supply systems. </p>
<p>Increases in heavy rainfall events (e.g., suggested changes in frequency of
  intense subtropical cyclones) (Lambert, 1995) and interactions with changes
  in snowmelt-generated runoff could increase the potential for flooding of human
  settlements in many water basins. Changes in snowmelt runoff may add to or subtract
  from rainfall events, depending on basin characteristics and climate changes
  for a basin. Extreme rainfall events can have widespread impacts on roads, railways,
  and other transportation links. As long as rainfall does not become more intense,
  impacts on urban roads and railways in temperate, tropical, and subtropical
  zones are likely to be modest. </p>
<p>Some areas in North America may experience changed risks of wildfire, land
  slippage, and severe weather events in a changed climate regime. Although this
  increase in risk is predicated on changes in the frequency or intensity of extreme
  weather events-about which there is controversy-considering these risks in the
  design of long-lived infrastructure may prove cost-effective in some circumstances.
  Human settlement infrastructure has increasingly concentrated in areas vulnerable
  to wildfire, such as the chaparral hillsides in California. Settlements in forested
  regions in many areas are vulnerable to seasonal wildfires. Areas of potentially
  increased fire danger include broad regions of Canada (Street, 1989; Forestry
  Canada, 1991) and seasonally dry Mediterranean climates like the state of California
  in the United States. It is possible that fuel buildup under drought conditions
  would decrease, decreasing fire intensities. Although generally less destructive
  of life than in many developing world locations, landslides triggered by periodic
  heavy rainfall events threaten property and infrastructure in steep lands of
  the western United States and Canada. Relict landslides occur in much of northern
  Europe and North America (Johnson and Vaughan, 1989). Although stable under
  present natural conditions, these landslides are reactivated by urban construction
  activities and are triggered by heavy rains (Caine, 1980). Lands denuded of
  vegetation by wildfire or urban development also are vulnerable. </p>
<p>Although there has been an apparent downward trend in Atlantic hurricanes in
  recent years (e.g., Landsea et al., 1996), not all authors agree (Karl et al.,
  1995b). What is certain is that the amount of property and the number of people
  in areas known to be vulnerable to hurricanes is large and increasing in low-lying
  coastal areas in much of the United States Atlantic and Gulf coasts. For example,
  although data on the amount or proportion of national physical assets exposed
  to climate hazards are not readily available, it is known that in the United
  States about $2 trillion in insured property value lies within 30 km of coasts
  exposed to Atlantic hurricanes (IRC, 1995). </p>
<p>Most authors have found increases in seasonal minimum temperatures in North
  America, but not in seasonal maximums (IPCC 1996, WG I, Chapter 3). These results
  would suggest reduced incidence of cold-related problems without a concomitant
  increase in heat-related problems. However, increases in regional cold outbreaks
  occurred from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. There has been little evidence
  of an increase in danger from tornadoes in the region (Grazulis, 1993; Ostby,
  1993). </p>
<p>Offshore oil and gas exploration and production would be influenced by change
  in extreme events. In the south, an increase in extreme storm events in the
  Gulf of Mexico may mean increasing fixed and floating platform engineering standards
  (i.e., more expensive platforms) and more frequent and longer storm interruptions.
  In terms of interruptions, weather-related production shutdowns result in losses
  to production companies in the range of $1 million dollars per day-$10,000-50,000
  per facility where evacuation is necessary. The industry defers millions of
  dollars annually in royalties (approximately $7 million each day for offshore
  Gulf of Mexico facilities) paid for hydrocarbon produced from fields owned by
  the public. </p>
