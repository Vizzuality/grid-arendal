<p>Using more recent climate change scenarios (IPCC 1996, WG I, Chapter 6; <a href="306.htm">Annex
  B</a> and <a href="315.htm">Annex C</a> of this report), forest decline and
  dieback ranged only from 0-19% of the individual forest areas (<a href="194.htm#table8-3">Table
  8-3</a>) when a direct CO<sub>2</sub> effect was included. However, if the direct CO<sub>2</sub> effect
  is withheld under the newer scenarios, dieback could be quite extensive in all
  forest types-with a range of 12-89% of the forest area-with large range contractions
  in all major forest zones. Results without a CO<sub>2</sub> effect under the IPCC's Second
  Assessment Report (SAR) scenarios are similar in magnitude to results with a
  CO<sub>2</sub> effect under the FAR scenarios (<a href="306.htm">Annex
  B</a>). Because
  the full 2xCO<sub>2</sub> effect may be less than fully realized, the potential forest
  response is bounded by simulating forests with and without a CO<sub>2</sub> effect. It
  is worth noting that by including sulfate aerosols in one SAR scenario, warming
  over the temperate mixed forest type in eastern North America is reduced, and
  there is less simulated forest dieback. </p>
<p>The SAR scenarios were produced from GCMs operated in a fully transient mode
  with gradual increases in greenhouse gases while coupled to a dynamic three-dimensional
  ocean. The biogeography models can only simulate equilibrium conditions, so
  average climate statistics were extracted from the simulations for a current-climate
  period and a period representing the time of 2xCO<sub>2</sub> forcing. At the time of 2xCO<sub>2</sub>
  forcing in the SAR scenarios, however, the GCMs had not equilibrated because
  of thermal inertia of the oceans and had only attained about 50-80% of their
  potential equilibrium temperature change. Thus, the SAR scenarios tend to be
  somewhat cooler than the FAR scenarios, which are run to equilibrium over a
  mixed-layer ocean. Nevertheless, when allowed to equilibrate to 2xCO<sub>2</sub> forcing,
  the SAR scenarios exhibit a global temperature sensitivity that is similar to
  the FAR scenarios (<a href="306.htm">Annex
  B</a>). Thus, the less deleterious
  or even beneficial impacts simulated under the SAR scenarios may simply be precursors
  to the more severe impacts simulated under the equilibrium FAR scenarios. </p>
<p>Assessments using gap models under the equilibrium FAR GCM scenarios or sensitivity
  analyses have been completed for eastern North America (Solomon, 1986), the
  southeastern United States (Urban and Shugart, 1989), British Columbia (Cumming
  and Burton, 1996), central Canada (Price and Apps, 1996), and the Great Lakes
  region (Pastor and Post, 1988; Botkin et al., 1989). Gap models differ from
  equilibrium biogeography models by simulating temporal dynamics of forests at
  a point; they therefore are able to simulate forest decline, dieback, or enhanced
  growth, as well as changes in species composition. The different models showed
  either increases or decreases in biomass depending on the method used for water
  balance calculations (Bugmann et al., 1996). Slight variations in model structure,
  small differences in soil texture, or the method for implementing direct CO<sub>2</sub>
  effects can affect the magnitude and direction of change in simulated productivity
  and biomass storage (Martin, 1992; Post et al., 1992). </p>
<p>Gap model results using the FAR GCM scenarios indicate the potential for significant
  forest dieback related to high temperatures, throughout the eastern United States-comparable
  to the more severe biogeography model simulations (Solomon, 1986; Pastor and
  Post, 1988; Botkin et al., 1989; Urban and Shugart, 1989). Given cooler SAR
  climate scenarios and improved gap model technology, however, these older dieback
  results may be too severe (Fischlin et al., 1995; Bugmann et al., 1996; Loehle
  and LeBlanc, 1996; Martin, 1996; Oja and Arp, 1996; Pacala et al., 1996; Post
  and Pastor, 1996; Shugart and Smith, 1996). Moreover, most of the gap model
  results do not include a direct CO<sub>2</sub> effect. </p>
<p>Studies using a regional forest-growth model suggest that forests in the northeastern
  United States might grow more (Aber et al., 1995), while forests in the southeastern
  United States could experience considerable forest dieback (McNulty et al.,
  1996). These simulations incorporate a direct CO<sub>2</sub> effect but do not consider
  vegetation redistribution. </p>
<p>Gap model simulations in the boreal forest indicate increased biomass under
  cooler scenarios (less warming) but some dieback or shifts to drier types under
  the warmer scenarios (Price and Apps, 1996). Within the temperate evergreen
  zone of British Columbia (and throughout North America), gap models indicate
  that forests could shift upward in elevation and possibly disappear from some
  zones because of the lack of winter cooling for forest regeneration, increased
  sensitivity to spring frosts, and drought stress (Cumming and Burton, 1996).
  Where simulated dieback occurs in any of the forest zones, it tends to occur
  within a few decades of initial warming-with, for example, a 30% reduction in
  biomass within 50 years in the Douglas fir zone (Cumming and Burton, 1996).
