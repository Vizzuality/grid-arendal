<h4>10.2.4.2. Coastal Flooding and Inundation </h4>
<p>Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya are located in the coastal zone, and together they
  account for more than 50% of Japan's industrial production. In these metropolitan
  areas, about 860 km<sup>2</sup> of coastal land-an area supporting 2 million people and
  with physical assets worth $450 billion (1985 dollars)-already are below mean
  high-water level. With a 1-m rise in mean sea level, this area would expand
  by a factor of 2.7 to embrace 4.1 million people and assets worth $908 billion.
  The same sea-level rise would expand the flood-prone area from 6,270 km<sup>2</sup> to
  8,900 km<sup>2</sup>. The cost of adjusting existing protection measures has been estimated
  at about $80 billion (IPCC 1996, WG III, Section 6.5.2). </p>
<p>One of the potential threats that sea-level rise poses to the coastal environment
  is exacerbated beach erosion. Sandy beaches occupy 20-25% of the total length
  of the Japanese coast. About 120 km<sup>2</sup> of these beaches have been eroded over
  the past 70 years. According to Bruun's Rule, an additional 118 km<sup>2</sup> of beaches-57%
  of the remaining sandy beaches in Japan today-would disappear with a 30-cm sea-level
  rise. This percentage would increase to 82% or 90% if the sea level rose by
  65 cm or 100 cm, respectively (Mimura, 1995). </p>
<p>Temperate Asia experiences tropical cyclones every year; these storms inundate
  and exacerbate flood situations in coastal areas, eroding and restructuring
  coastal formations. There is no conclusive evidence that the frequency or intensity
  of tropical cyclones would change as a result of climate change or that a systematic
  shift in their tracks would occur (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 9.3.2). However,
  with the projected sea-level rise, even if the frequency and severity of storms
  remain unchanged in the future, storm surge could still present an increased
  hazard. It should be pointed out that China and other countries of the region
  have a long history of experience in the defense against sea encroachment, through
  the construction of dikes, seawalls, and other structures (ESD-CAS, 1994). </p>
<h4>10.2.4.3. Integrated Coastal Zone Management<a name="int"></a> </h4>
<p>Coastal oceans provide rich living and nonliving resources; serve as media
  for transportation and recreation; and receive, dilute, and transform massive
  quantities of wastes from human activities on land. Coastal oceans already are
  under stress as a result of a combination of factors (e.g., increased population
  pressure, habitat destruction, increased land-based pollutant loads, and increased
  nutrient inputs from rivers). The effects of climate change therefore will constitute
  additional-largely adverse-series of impacts on an already overstressed resource,
  with potential for synergistic relationships among stresses (IPCC 1996, WG II,
  Section 8.2.2). </p>

<h4>10.2.5. Human Settlements and Industry<a name="human"></a> </h4>
<h4>10.2.5.1. Human Settlements<a name="settlements"></a> </h4>
<p>If future climates resemble those projected by GCMs, wetter coasts, drier midcontinent
  areas, and sea-level rise may cause the gravest effects of climate change through
  sudden human migration, as millions of people are displaced by shoreline erosion,
  river and coastal flooding, or severe drought. For example, agricultural settlements
  in China are projected to be sensitive to drought conditions (IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Section 12.4.2). </p>
<p>Climate change may affect the intensity or the probability of the occurrence
  of extreme weather events. The impact of extreme events on human settlements
  can be affected by the grade of the extreme event, the level of economic and
  technological development, and the extent of countermeasures taken. In Japan,
  for example, although the number of deaths is large for the more severe typhoons,
  such deaths have been declining since World War II (see <a href="#figure10-3">Figure
  10-3</a>). This decline is thought to have occurred because of increasingly
  effective mitigation measures taken during the past 40 years. These measures
  include conservation of mountain slopes, rivers, and coasts; harmonization of
  institutions and laws related to disaster mitigation; preparation of systems
  for disaster prevention, including better design; meteorological observation
  and information systems; promotion of people's consciousness with regard to
  preventing disasters; and development of communication systems for disaster
  occurrences. On the other hand, economic damages from typhoons have been rising
  in Japan during the same period because of the increasing values of properties
  along the coasts (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 12.4.2). <br>

  In mountain lands and continental permafrost areas, cryospheric change could
  reduce slope stability and increase the incidence of natural hazards for people,
  buildings and other structures, pipelines, and communication links (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Section 7.5). </p>
<p>During summer days, from the early morning to the time of maximum temperature,
  the temperature inside a big oasis in the arid regions of northWest China usually
  is 2-3°C lower than that outside the area; this gradient is called the "oasis
  effect" (Du and Maki, 1994; Yoshino and Liu, 1997). In the future, as the population
  increases in oases, so will the cultivated area and water consumption. This
  pattern could lower the moisture content in the oasis and hence weaken the oasis
  effect. Climate change thus could compound the hardship for human settlements
  in the oases. </p>
<p>Ironically, some arid regions of northWest China also have been suffering from
  heavy rainfall and flood damages. In Xinjiang, during the period 1949-1990,
  about one-third of the total natural hazards and two-thirds of the total losses
  incurred by natural hazards were caused by floods (Yoshino and Liu, 1997). Under
  global warming, this tendency could be intensified because intense rainfall
  is likely to occur more frequently. </p>
