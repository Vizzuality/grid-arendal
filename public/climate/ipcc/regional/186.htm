<h4>8.2.3. Climate Scenarios </h4>
<p>As discussed in IPCC (1996, WG I, Section 6.6), output from transient runs
  of atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (hereafter referred to simply
  as GCMs) has become available that can be used as the basis for improved regional
  analysis of potential climate change. The main emphasis of current analyses
  is on the simulation of seasonally averaged surface air temperature and precipitation.
  Climate scenario information for North America is available from several GCMs.
  In IPCC (1990, WG I), one of the five regions identified for analysis of regional
  climate change simulation was central North America (35-50�N, 85-105�W). Output
  for this region from different coupled model runs with dynamic oceans was analyzed
  by Cubasch et al. (1994) and Kittel et al. (1998). Results for central North
  America, as well as the other identified regions, are depicted in <a href="307.htm#figureB-1">Figure
  B-1</a> (<a href="306.htm">Annex
  B</a>), which shows differences between region-average
  values at the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling and the control run, as well as differences
  between control run averages and observations (hereafter referred to as bias)
  for winter and summer surface air temperature and precipitation. These model
  results reflect increasing CO<sub>2</sub> only and do not include the effects of sulfate
  aerosols. The biases in <a href="307.htm#figureB-1">Figure B-1</a> (<a href="306.htm">Annex
  B</a>) are presented as a reference for interpretation of the scenarios because
  it can be generally expected that the better the match between control run and
  observed climate (i.e., the lower the biases), the higher the confidence in
  the simulated change scenarios. A summary of these transient model experiments
  is given in <a href="307.htm#figureB-1">Table B-1</a> (<a href="306.htm">Annex
  B</a>).
  Most experiments use a rate of CO<sub>2</sub> increase of 1%/year, yielding a doubling
  of CO<sub>2</sub> after 70 years. </p>
<p>Scenarios produced for central North America by these transient experiments
  vary quite widely among models for temperature but less so for precipitation.
  GCM simulations also have been conducted that consider the effect of combined
  greenhouse gas- and direct sulfate aerosol-forcing on temperature, precipitation,
  and soil moisture (see <a href="306.htm">Annex
  B</a>). For central North America,
  the inclusion of sulfate aerosols results in a projected warming of 0-0.5�C
  in the summer and 1.4-3.4�C in the winter by the year 2100. In the case of precipitation,
  the inclusion of sulfate aerosol-forcing has little effect on the projections
  (see <a href="306.htm">Annex
  B</a>). </p>
<p>Using the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC) GCM (see <a href="306.htm">Annex
  B</a>),
  Lambert (1995) found a 4% decrease in cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere, though
  the frequency of intense cyclones increased. Lambert hypothesized that the latent
  heat effect is responsible for the greater number of intense storms. No change
  in storm tracks was evident. A few areas showed increased frequencies, such
  as off Cape Hatteras, over Hudson Bay, and west of Alaska. These results are
  similar to those of Rowntree (1993), who found a 40% increase in Atlantic gales,
  though fewer intense storms over eastern North America. Hall et al. (1994) and
  Carnell et al. (1996) found an intensification and northward shift of storm
  tracks. </p>
<p>Regarding sea-level rise scenarios, for IPCC Scenario IS92a, global mean sea
  level is projected to be about 50 cm higher by 2100 than today, with a range
  of uncertainty of 20-86 cm (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 7.5). It is possible that
  for much of the North American coastline, future sea-level rise will be greater
  than the global average, given the higher historical rates of sea-level rise
  along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts (see <a href="184.htm">Section
  8.2.2</a>). By contrast, future sea-level rise along the Pacific coast may be
  less than the global average rise because of this region's generally lower historical
  rates. Even less sea-level rise might be expected in extreme northern North
  America, given the historical drop in sea levels at many locations (Titus and
  Narayanan, 1996). </p>
