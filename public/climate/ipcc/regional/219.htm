<p>Seasonal sea-ice extent, at least in some areas of the Northern Hemisphere,
  is retreating. This information, coupled with projections of warming, suggests
  that current barriers to gene flow among marine mammal stocks in the Arctic
  may change dramatically in the next 50 years. Although this shift may not result
  in a reduction in abundance at the species level, it could very well change
  the population structure of many species of Arctic whales and seals, which will
  greatly affect their management. </p>
<p>Coastal wetlands and beaches may be eliminated in some areas by rising sea
  level. As a result, marine mammal calving and pupping beaches may disappear
  from areas where there are no alternatives. Affected marine mammals could include,
  for example, all of the temperate and tropical seals and sea lions, coastal
  whales and dolphins, and manatees in estuarine habitats. </p>
<p>Six species of sea turtles (all of which are listed as endangered or threatened
  under the U.S. Endangered Species Act) regularly spend all or part of their
  lives off North American coasts and in U.S. territorial waters of the Caribbean
  Sea and Pacific Ocean. The loss of nesting beaches that would result from the
  combination of coastal development and projected sea-level rise is a threat
  to all marine turtle species. </p>
<h4>8.3.7. Coastal Systems<a name="systems"></a> </h4>
<p>Rising sea level is gradually inundating wetlands and lowlands; eroding beaches;
  exacerbating coastal flooding; threatening coastal structures; raising water
  tables; and increasing the salinity of rivers, bays, and aquifers (Barth and
  Titus, 1984). The areas most vulnerable to rising seas are found along the Gulf
  of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean south of Cape Cod. Although there also are
  large low areas around San Francisco Bay and the Fraser delta (British Columbia),
  most of the Pacific coast is less vulnerable than the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.
  Because of a combination of rocky shores, lower rates of sea-level rise, higher
  elevations, and less shorefront development, most of the Canadian coast is much
  less vulnerable to the direct effects of rising sea level (Shaw et al., 1994)
  than the low, sandy and muddy shores of the United States. </p>
<p>This section focuses primarily on the impacts of sea-level rise, which is the
  most thoroughly studied effect of global warming on coastal zones. Nevertheless,
  global climate change also is expected to alter coastal hydrology, the frequency
  and severity of severe storms, and sea-ice cover. Moreover, the impacts of regional
  climate change on inland areas also will affect coastal zones-particularly the
  estuaries into which most of the continent drains. </p>
<h4>8.3.7.1. Physical Effects and Their Implications<a name="physical"></a> </h4>
<p>The implications of rising sea level are well understood, in part because sea
  level has been rising relative to the land along most of the coast of North
  America (and falling in a few areas) for thousands of years. For the most part,
  the relative rise and fall of sea level has been caused by adjustments of the
  earth's crust to the glacial mass that was removed from the land surfaces after
  the end of the last ice age (Grant, 1975). Change in the volume of water in
  oceans was also of importance. Water locked up in ice caps during ice ages lowered
  the volume of water in oceans, thus lowering sea level. The changes discussed
  here have occurred over geologic time (Holocene Epoch-last 10,000 years). The
  land is rising (i.e., relative sea level is falling) in the northern areas that
  had been covered by the ice sheet; land is subsiding in nearby areas that were
  not covered by the glaciers, such as the Canadian maritime provinces and U.S.
  middle Atlantic states. </p>
<p><i>A 50-cm rise in sea level would inundate approximately 50% of North American
  coastal wetlands in the next century; many beaches would be squeezed between
  advancing seas and engineering structures, particularly along estuarine shores.</i>
</p>
<p>Coastal marshes and swamps generally are found between the highest tide of
  the year and mean sea level. Coastal wetlands provide important habitat and
  nourishment for a large number of birds and fish found in coastal areas. Wetlands
  generally have been able to keep pace with the historic rate of sea-level rise
  (Kaye and Barghoorn, 1964). As a result, the area of dry land just above wetlands
  is less than the area of wetlands. If sea level rises more rapidly than wetlands
  can accrete, however, there will be a substantial net loss of wetlands (Titus,
  1986; Park et al., 1989). Because the current rate of sea-level rise is greater
  than the rate that prevailed over the past several thousand years (IPCC 1996,
  WG I), some areas-such as Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) along the
  Chesapeake Bay-are already experiencing large losses of coastal wetlands (Kearney
  and Stevenson, 1985). Blackwater NWR is also a victim of herbivory by an introduced
  rodent, which makes interpretation of the role of sea-level rise difficult.
