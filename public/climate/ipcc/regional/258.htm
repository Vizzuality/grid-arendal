<h4>9.3.9. Cultural Integrity </h4>
<p>In many small island states, a number of factors, including isolation and close
  traditional ties to the land and sea, have contributed to the development of
  a unique set of cultural traits on different islands or groups of islands. In
  Tuvalu, for instance-as in other small Pacific atoll states-attachment to land
  and sea is a critical component of local cosmology (SPREP, 1996). Any force
  that poses a threat to this attachment would be culturally and socially disruptive
  in these traditional societies. </p>
<p>Ethnic, linguistic, social, and religious differences among and between the
  peoples of Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia in the South Pacific illustrate
  the cultural diversity of the island states. The unique cultures that have developed
  over millenia on the resource-rich and diverse high-volcanic and limestone islands
  in the region, such as Vanuatu, Fiji, and Samoa, are unlikely to be seriously
  threatened by climate change. On the other hand, resource-poor, low-reef islands
  and atolls, which have developed equally distinctive traditional identities
  over centuries-such as the Tuvaluan, Kiribati, Marshallese, and Maldivian cultures-are
  more at risk. The fragility of these low islands and their sensitivity to sea-level
  change and storms suggest that the future existence of such islands and their
  cultural diversity could be seriously threatened (Roy and Connell, 1991). </p>
<h1>9.4. Integrated Analysis of Potential Vulnerabilities and Impacts<a name="inte"></a>
</h1>
<p>Because of their strong dependence on economic sectors that are highly sensitive
  to climate change effects (e.g., coastal tourism and agriculture), small island
  states clearly are a vulnerable group of countries (IPCC 1996, WG III, Sections
  6.5.10, 6.5.11). Briguglio (1993) developed a mean "vulnerability index" for
  different categories of nations, based on three selected variables: export dependence,
  insularity and remoteness, and proneness to natural disasters. Although there
  may be some limitations associated with this index (e.g., the restricted criteria),
  it supports the widely held view that small island states will be more vulnerable
  than any other group of countries to projected climate change impacts. On a
  scale from 0 (lowest vulnerability) to 1 (highest vulnerability), a score of
  0.590 (the highest index) was derived for the small island group. A lower index,
  0.539, was calculated for other developing countries; the index for all developing
  countries as a group was 0.417. Indeed, based on Briguglio's index, 9 of the
  10 most vulnerable countries are small islands. Thus, though the index has its
  limitations, it draws attention to the high vulnerability of small island states
  in relation to all other regional groups. </p>
<p>Pernetta (1988) ranks Pacific islands in terms of their vulnerability to sea-level
  rise, taking other factors-such as elevation-into consideration. Based on his
  classification, states such as the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Kiribati would
  suffer "profound" impacts, including disappearance in the worst-case scenario;
  "severe impacts," resulting in major population displacement, would be experienced
  by the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, and Tonga; "moderate to severe
  impacts" would be felt by Fiji and the Solomon Islands; and "local severe to
  catastrophic" effects would be experienced by Vanuatu and Western Samoa. </p>
<p>It must be emphasized, however, that the sensitivity of small islands to the
  projected effects of climate change cannot be attributed to any single factor
  (e.g., size, elevation, remoteness, or any other) or to a select group of factors.
  Rather, the level of vulnerability of these islands is determined by the cumulative
  and synergistic result of these and related biophysical attributes (including
  the degree of natural adaptive capacity), combined with the islands' economic
  and sociocultural characters (including current and future levels of anthropogenic
  stress) (see, e.g., SPREP, 1996). Moreover, because many small islands already
  are prone to other hazards (e.g., tropical cyclones and storm surges) that invariably
  have adverse effects, climate change impacts on longer time scales could render
  these countries extremely vulnerable. </p>
<p>The Caribbean countries are a case in point. Some face an annual threat from
  hurricanes (cyclones); others, such as St. Vincent and Montserrat, are prone
  to disruptive volcanic activity; and still others are affected by periodic earthquakes
  and tsunamis (Maul, 1996). Most have extensive, vulnerable, low-lying coastal
  plains; some (e.g., Barbados, Antigua, St. Kitts, Bahamas) are heavily dependent
  on groundwater supplies; and for many, tourism is the most vital economic sector.
  A higher incidence of flooding and inundation, beach and coastal land loss,
  reef damage, salinization of the freshwater lens, and disruption of tourism
  and infrastructure would create economic and social crises in a number of these
  islands. Thus, many Caribbean countries must be classified as vulnerable to
  the effects of climate change and sea-level rise-not simply because of their
  size or elevation alone but because of strong linkages between these and other
  physical characteristics, natural resources, and socioeconomic structures. </p>
<p>Moreover, for small islands with limited resources, it is absolutely essential
  for integrated assessment models to include the value of nonmarketed goods and
  services that also will be at risk. Commodities such as cultural and subsistence
  assets (e.g., community structures), recreational values, traditional skills
  and knowledge, and natural values (e.g., the capacity of mangroves to filter
  nitrate and phosphate and thus reduce nutrient loading to the marine zone) are
  just as important to some small islands as marketed goods and services. Such
  nonmarketed goods and services often are not incorporated into integrated assessment
  models. From the perspective of small island states, the integration of these
  assets is an important and necessary challenge facing the modeling community.
  Some recent attempts to develop an appropriate methodology for vulnerability
  assessment, incorporating these factors, have been made by Yamada et al. (1995)
  for southWest Pacific islands. </p>
<p>Clearly, it would be inappropriate to assess the sensitivity of small islands
  to climate change impacts in isolation from other factors that contribute to
  their overall vulnerability. Constraining factors such as size, elevation, limited
  resources (natural, financial, and technological), proneness to natural hazards,
  dependence on external markets, and generally high population growth rates enhance
  the vulnerability of these island states (Alm et al., 1993). Only when the effects
  of such factors are evaluated in combination with the threat of climate change
  impacts can a meaningful vulnerability index for small island states be developed
  and appropriate adaptation options pursued (see <a href="#box9-6">Box 9-6</a>).
