<h4>6.3.1.3. Deserts </h4>
<p>Extremely arid (<100 mm annual precipitation) deserts in Latin America (i.e.,
  the Chihuahuan, Sonoran, Peruvian, Atacama, Monte, Patagonian deserts) occupy
  a large proportion of the region (see <a href="130.htm#figure6-4">Figure 6-4</a>);
  they have significant species richness and a high degree of endemism (IPCC 1996,
  WG II, Section 4.4.2). On the other hand, their contribution to the region's
  primary productivity and C and N pools is extremely low. Because they are driven
  by discrete events (e.g., rainfall) that occur at irregular intervals, deserts
  are described as pulse-driven ecosystems (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 3.3.2);
  soil instability, dune systems, and shifting boundaries are some of their typical
  features. In some of the driest coastal deserts (e.g., in northern Chile and
  Peru), fog banks (camanchaca) are particularly frequent and provide the largest,
  if not the entire, moisture supply in most years (IPCC 1996, WG II, Figure 3-1
  and Section 3.3.4). Harvesting of camanchaca-using frames with vertical nylon
  threads, either static or rotating at very low speeds-is a common activity among
  communities along the coast; such harvesting provides enough water to maintain
  some coastal rangelands and woodlands, which support seasonal grazing by sheep
  and goats. </p>
<p>Specific information on the vulnerability of Latin America's extreme deserts
  is rather poor, and further research is required. As with all extreme deserts,
  however, these systems already experience wide fluctuations in rainfall and
  are adapted to coping with the consequences of extreme conditions. Initial changes
  associated with climate change are unlikely to create conditions significantly
  outside the present range of variation (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 3.2). </p>
<p>Changes in precipitation projected under a set of climate scenarios assembled
  for sensitivity studies in the Second Assessment Report (SAR) (Greco et al.,
  1994) (e.g., a 25% increase in the present mean of 2 mm/yr rainfall) are unlikely
  to produce major ecosystem changes. Regarding changes in temperature, increases
  projected in the Greco et al. (1994) scenarios typically are in the range of
  0.5-2.0�C, with greater increases in the summer. A rise of 2�C without an increase
  in precipitation would increase potential evapotranspiration by 0.2-2 mm per
  day (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 3.3.2, 4.2.1). </p>
<p>Human-induced desertification at the boundary between arid and extremely arid
  areas has the potential to counteract any ameliorating effects of climate change
  on most deserts, unless appropriate management actions are taken. Even if wetter
  conditions were to prevail, their effects may be overridden by pressure from
  resource exploitation (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 4.4.2). Other arid and semi-arid
  areas in Latin America also suffer from desertification; in Mexico, for example,
  water erosion alone affects 85% of the territory (Gligo, 1995). Vulnerability
  studies undertaken in Mexico under the USCSP (Gay-Garc�a and Ruiz Suarez, 1996)
  show that drought in central Mexico could be severe, affecting various states
  in the area (such as Michoacan, where more than 50% of the land surface is highly
  vulnerable to desertification). Similar trends are expected in Jalisco, Colima,
  Nayarit, Queretaro, Hidalgo, and Guanajuato. </p>
