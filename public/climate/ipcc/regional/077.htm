<h4>4.3.3.1. Agriculture and Horticulture </h4>
<p>The possible interactions among atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, climate, soil, plants, animals,
  and humans in the agricultural system are very complex, which makes it difficult
  to draw firm conclusions about agricultural responses to projected climate changes
  (Warrick et al., 1996). However, research has indicated that increased CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization,
  higher temperatures, and changed rainfall characteristics are likely to lead
  to changes in productivity and crop yield; changes in grain quality and animal
  pasture feed quality; changes in the incidence of diseases, pests, and weeds;
  and changes in the suitability of districts for particular crop types and farming
  systems (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 13). Furthermore, it can be expected that
  climate change impacts on other countries' agriculture will lead to changes
  in global food markets and that these external changes may have as great an
  effect on the region's agricultural industries as internal changes. </p>
<p>The yield responses reported for studies of Australasian crops and pasture
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.6.4 and Table 13-7) cover a wide range of values,
  depending on the situation studied and the research assumptions. Considering
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature rises (but not necessarily rainfall
  changes) and ignoring adaptive measures, it appears that pasture productivity
  may generally increase (e.g., Greer et al., 1995), but annual crop yield may
  increase only slightly or remain about constant (e.g., Wang et al., 1992; Rawson,
  1995; Wang and Connor, 1996), or even reduce slightly (Muchow and Sinclair,
  1991). As long as slower-maturing grain cultivars are available, crop yields
  may benefit, with the beneficial effects of higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations outweighing
  the reductions in yield expected from shorter grain-filling periods associated
  with warmings (Wang et al., 1992; Wang and Connor, 1996). However, if sufficiently
  longer-maturing cultivars cease to become available due to greater warmings,
  yields may decrease. This would happen first at low latitudes, and the effect
  would increase as further warming occurs later in the next century (Pittock,
  1995, 1996). </p>
<p>An empirically based study by Nicholls (1997) has attributed 30-50% of the
  observed increase in Australian wheat yield since 1952 (which was about 45%)
  to observed climatic trends, with increases in minimum temperature the dominant
  influence. The method excludes the direct physiological effects of increasing
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration on yield but could be confounded if farmers used more fertilizer
  in climatically favorable years. </p>
<p>The interaction of climate change and increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on pasture
  quality and subsequent animal productivity remains uncertain (Owensby, 1993).
  Pasture plants grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration always seem to have lower
  protein (Arp and Berendse, 1993) and higher nonstructural carbohydrate contents
  (Lutze, 1996), which implies an impact on the nutritional quality of the forage.
  In high-rainfall temperate regions, particularly early in the growing season,
  most forage is eaten as green sward (or products preserved from green material),
  in which case the increased soluble carbohydrate content would increase the
  digestibility and nutritional value of the forage (Smith et al., 1997). Reductions
  in feed quality may occur through reductions in digestibility and increase in
  lignin content of tropical grasses grown at higher temperatures (Wilson, 1982)
  and increased stem-to-leaf ratios of plants grown under high CO<sub>2</sub> levels (e.g.,
  Morison and Gifford, 1984). Thus, rangeland forage quality is likely to decrease
  at some times of year-suggesting an increased need for feed supplements or legume
  pastures. However, higher plant water-use efficiency under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels
  may result in more "green days" each year, partly offsetting the above effects
  (McCown, 1980). </p>
<p>In Australia's rangelands, scenarios of climate change suggest alterations
  in the temporal and spatial components that are likely to increase variability
  and unpredictability in plant productivity and community composition. Increased
  competition from woody weed species in mixed pasture may have a significant
  negative effect on grass growth (Scanlan, 1992) and hence livestock production
  (Stafford Smith et al., 1994). It is anticipated that in temperate areas of
  Australia and New Zealand, encroachment of subtropical grasses into pastures
  may be exacerbated not only by the warming conditions but also by the strong
  response of C<sub>4</sub> growth during recurring periods of water stress (Campbell et
  al., 1996). This would affect the types of possible grazing activity and would
  require greater consideration of land management issues, such as the use of
  fire for woody weed control and pest animal management (Stafford Smith et al.,
  1994). </p>
<p>Aborigines have a large and increasing role in land management in the pastoral
  zone (Young et al., 1991; Ross et al., 1994). Aboriginal land supports a wide
  range of uses, including pastoralism, hunting and gathering, horticulture, conservation,
  cultural tourism, and mining. Climate change may affect native bush food supplies
  and sacred biota, as well as water resources for remote Aboriginal communities.
</p>
<p>Temperature increases will very likely lead to an increase in pasture production
  in mid-latitudes, with corresponding increases in livestock production. However,
  if most of the increase in pasture growth comes in summer, winter feed may remain
  the limiting factor unless there is increased feed conservation or changes in
  livestock production systems. Increased pasture production may not occur if
  there is an increase in the frequency of extreme events, such as summer droughts
  or late-winter snowstorms in lowland sheep areas of New Zealand. Any increases
  in production also would depend on farmers' attitudes toward risk and on the
  signals reflected back to producers from the effect of economic and climate
  changes on customers and competitors (Martin et al., 1991). </p>
<p>Livestock-which in this region are largely unhoused-are expected to benefit
  from warmer winters, possibly extended growing seasons, and possible minor improvements
  in feed quality in temperate high-rainfall zones. In some circumstances, however,
  they may be negatively affected by lower nutritional quality of feed (Owensby,
  1993) and greater summer heat stress (Russell, 1991; McKeon et al., 1993). There
  may be increases in diseases of tropical origin but decreases in cold-weather
  diseases (Sutherst et al., 1996). In the New Zealand high country, it is not
  uncommon for huge losses of livestock to result from cold, wet weather and heavy
  snowfalls during winter and early spring. Warmer winters may lead to reductions
  in the numbers of animals lost. </p>
