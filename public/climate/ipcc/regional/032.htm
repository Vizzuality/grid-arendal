<h4>2.3.4.2. Adaptation Strategies and Measures in the Coastal Zone</h4>
<p>Ibe (1990) has found that large-scale protective engineering measures are impractical
  in Africa because of the high costs to countries in the region. Instead, low-cost,
  low-technology, but effective measures-such as permeable, nonconcrete, floating
  breakwaters; artificial raising of beach elevations; and installation of rip-rap,
  timber groins, and so forth-are considered more sensible. </p>
<p>In Egypt, protection of beaches and associated infrastructure must depend upon
  continuous and periodic nourishment. The total cost of protection is estimated
  to be only US$21 million and $42 million for the 0.5-m and 1-m scenarios, respectively
  (El-Raey et al., 1995). The city of Alexandria is built on three intermittent
  calcareous ridges, parts of which are leveled and thus constitute a potential
  pathway for rising water to reach the lowland south of the city. El-Raey et
  al. (1995) have suggested that maintaining the beaches in front of these pathways,
  using beach nourishment, will help to prevent surface water from reaching the
  lowland south of the city through these paths, particularly during storm surges.
  Construction of small dikes also may be necessary. </p>
<p>According to French et al. (1995), the potential cost of protection against
  a 1-m rise in sea level in Nigeria ranges from US$558-668 million if densely
  developed areas are protected (important areas protection) to US$1.4-1.8 billion
  if all shores are protected from erosion, inundation, and flooding (total protection).
  Under the "important areas protection" option, the 1-m sea-level rise scenario
  would require a total of 430 km of seawall and associated fill, costing nearly
  US$200 million. An additional 474 km of sheltered seawall and 180 km of open-coast
  seawall is required when total protection is considered. More than 600,000 villagers
  could be displaced by a 1-m rise in sea level, based on existing population
  (French et al., 1995). It is impractical to protect these villages and populations
  at risk in Nigeria from a 1-m rise in sea level. Relocation probably is the
  most practical solution to the problem of inundation of the villages. </p>
<p>If the option considered in Senegal is "important areas protection," Dennis
  et al. (1995) suggest that about 70 km-or about 14.5%-of the open coastline
  would require protection. Total protection would require protection of 2,063
  km, including 310 km of open-coast seawall and 1,680 km of sheltered-coast seawall.
  The cost of total protection is about 2.5-4 times higher than the costs of important
  areas protection. </p>
<p>With regard to The Gambia, Jallow et al. (1996) argue that if sea-level rise
  were to occur as envisaged, the most appropriate response (considering The Gambia's
  economic situation) would be to protect important areas. The projected cost
  includes US$3.1 million for construction of a 7-km low-cost seawall and US$3.9
  million for construction of a revetment. About 16 km of dikes is required to
  protect villages bordering wetlands and swamplands from seasonal flooding. Four
  types of actions could fulfill required protection needs: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Repair of groin systems</li>
  <li>Construction of breakwaters</li>
  <li>Construction of low-cost seawalls</li>
  <li>Construction of revetments.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Cote d'Ivoire, the most essential response to a potential sea-level rise
  of 1 m in the next century would be to protect important areas-such as the two
  ports at Abidjan and San Pedro; the airport; tourism facilities; residential
  areas; and other areas of high economic importance, particularly in Grand Bassam,
  Abidjan, Grand Lahou, Sassandra, San Pedro, and Tabou (ICST, 1996). No cost
  estimates are attached to this protection. </p>
<p>Within an integrated approach, there is a great opportunity to anticipate problems
  associated with sea-level rise rather than simply react to change as, or after,
  it occurs (Nicholls and Leatherman, 1994). Furthermore, a well-planned response
  that seeks to anticipate the physical impacts of sea-level rise in a timely
  fashion will minimize unwise decisions and result in lower costs for reactive
  responses such as protection (Nicholls and Leatherman, 1995). Anticipatory responses
  include urban growth planning, building setbacks, wetland preservation and mitigation,
  public awareness, and integrated coastal zone management. </p>
<p>Policies and regulations concerning the use of the coastal zone for any form
  of human activity should include consideration of sea-level rise. Physical planning
  and building-control measures and regulations should be instituted and implemented.
  Allocation of land for any economically useful purpose in areas likely to be
  flooded or inundated should be avoided. The public should be informed of the
  risk of living in coastal and lowland areas that are threatened by sea-level
  rise. Timely public education about erosion, sea-level rise, and flooding risks
  could be a cost-effective means of reducing future expenditures. Where coastal
  infrastructures such as roads, fish land, and curing plants are approved and
  must be constructed, the authorities and owners of these infrastructures should
  make sure that marginal increases in the height of the structures are included
  to offset sea-level rise (Smith and Lenhart, 1996) and other related phenomena.
  People located in high-risk areas should be offered incentives to relocate out
  of these areas. Setbacks could be used as buffer zones to allow sea level to
  rise without threatening coastal development. French et al. (1995) recommended
  incorporating buffer zones between the shore and new coastal development in
  Nigeria. </p>
<p>Adaptation to climate change and concomitant adverse effects will involve an
  understanding of climate change parameters and dynamics, including monitoring
  and data analysis of climate change parameters. This strategy should lead to
  an African Climate Change Scenario (ACCS), upon which countries can base their
  adaptation options. Existing scenarios and adaptation measures for climate change
  and sea-level rise are built around Western experiences. </p>
<p>All of the adaptation strategies, options, and policies discussed above will
  reduce the risks from current climate variability and protect against potential
  climate change and sea-level rise. These measures should be combined in a coastal
  zone management plan (CZMP). The CZMP brings together all actors in the coastal
  area to address coastal-zone problems. The program should consist of a set of
  principles and plans to guide the use of coastal land for conservation, recreation,
  and development. </p>
