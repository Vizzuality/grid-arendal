<p><i>Projected changes in water temperatures, salinity, and currents can affect
  the growth, survival, reproduction, and spatial distribution of marine fish
  species and of the prey, competitors, and predators that influence the dynamics
  of these species. </i></p>
<p>Environmental conditions have a marked effect on the growth of many fish species.
  For example, mean bottom temperatures account for 90% of the observed (10-fold)
  difference in growth rates between different Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stocks
  in the north Atlantic (Brander, 1994, 1995). Warmer temperatures lead to faster
  growth rates. Regional studies have shown similar results (Fleming, 1960; Shackell
  et al., 1995). In the northWest Atlantic, the largest cod typically are found
  on Georges Bank-where a 4-year-old fish, on average, is five times bigger than
  one off Labrador and Newfoundland. Temperature accounts not only for differences
  in growth rates between cod stocks but also year-to-year changes in growth within
  a stock. </p>
<p>In addition to growth, the environment affects the reproductive cycle of fish
  and shellfish. For example, the age of sexual maturity of certain fish species
  is determined by ambient temperature. Atlantic cod off Labrador and the northern
  Grand Banks mature at age 7 and in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence and the
  eastern Scotian Shelf at age 6; in the warmer waters off southWest Nova Scotia
  and on Georges Bank, they mature at 3.5 years and 2 years, respectively (Myers
  et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Spawning times also are influenced by temperature. Generally, cold temperatures
  result in delayed spawning (Hutchinson and Myers, 1994a), whereas warm temperatures
  result in earlier spawning. Marak and Livingstone (1970) found that a 1.5-2°C
  temperature change produced a difference in the spawning time of haddock on
  Georges Bank by a month, with earlier spawning and a longer duration in warmer
  years. </p>
<p>Temperature is one of the primary factors, along with food availability and
  suitable spawning grounds, that determine the large-scale distribution patterns
  of fish and shellfish. Because most fish species or stocks tend to prefer a
  specific temperature range (Coutant, 1977), long-term changes in temperature
  can lead to expansion or contraction of the distribution range of certain species.
  These shifts generally are most evident near their northern or southern boundaries;
  warming results in a distributional shift northward, and cooling draws species
  southward. </p>
<p>Changes in distribution also were observed during a warming trend in the 1940s
  in the Gulf of Maine-which produced a northward shift in the abundance and distribution
  of Atlantic mackerel, American lobster, yellowtail flounder, Atlantic menhaden,
  and whiting, as well as the range extension of more southern species such as
  the green crab (Taylor et al., 1957). </p>
<p>Frank et al. (1990) projected a northward shift of the southern extensions
  of important fisheries such as Atlantic cod, Atlantic halibut, American plaice,
  and redfish out of the Gulf of Maine and into Canadian waters. Also projected
  is the northern extension of more southern fish species such as Atlantic menhaden,
  butterfish, and redhake further northward into the Gulf of Maine. Coutant (1990)
  suggests a northward shift of summer stocks of striped bass, with losses occurring
  for Virgina, Delaware, and New York and gains projected for Massachusetts, New
  Hampshire, Maine, and New Brunswick. </p>
<p>Understanding recruitment variability has been the number one issue in fisheries
  science in this century. Since the advent of intensive fishing, it has become
  increasingly difficult to sort out the relative importance of fishing versus
  environment as the cause of recruitment variability. Still, recruitment levels
  frequently have been associated with variations in temperature during the first
  years of life of the fish (Drinkwater and Myers, 1987). American lobster landings
  increased steadily during the 1980s and into the 1990s, to all-time historic
  highs. However, the temperature/landing relationships for lobster are not consistent
  with an expected positive linear relationship-suggesting that more than one
  variable can control the relationship, and a different variable may be the dominant
  one at any given time. </p>
<p>Climate also can affect the fishery through its influence on availability (fish
  available to be caught) and catchability (difficulty to catch), both of which
  depend not only on the abundance of fish but on when and how they are distributed.
  If cod traps are located in waters that are too cold, catches are low. Only
  when the temperature is warm enough do catches increase. In the case of lobster
  catchability, when temperatures are low, lobster are known to move slowly, reducing
  the potential for encountering lobster traps and hence reducing catchability
  (McLeese and Wilder, 1958). </p>
<p>Climate change can be expected to result in distributional shifts in species,
  with the most obvious changes occurring near the northern or southern boundaries
  of species' ranges. Migration patterns will shift, causing changes in arrival
  times along the migration route. Growth rates are expected to vary (with the
  amplitude and direction species-dependent). Recruitment success could be affected
  by changes in time of spawning, fecundity rates, survival rate of larvae, and
  food availability. Another possibility associated with climate change is a change
  in stratification (as a result of differences in heating, freshwater, and vertical
  mixing rates), which may lead to changes in the ratio of pelagic to groundfish
  abundance (Frank et al., 1990). If stratification were to increase, more production
  would be expected to be recycled within the upper layers of the oceans, and
  less would reach the bottom. </p>
<p>Evidence of environmental control on the distribution of marine fish is abundant.
  For example, Welch et al. (1995) have identified critical temperatures defining
  the southern boundaries of salmonid species. The authors suggest that future
  temperature changes in the northern Pacific therefore could have a direct impact
  on the production dynamics of Pacific salmon. Impacts of global warming in the
  ocean, however, will be difficult to separate from natural shifts in ocean carrying
  capacity. A general warming of the ocean will have an impact on predators and
  prey distributions. In the Strait of Georgia, there was an abrupt decline in
  marine survival after the 1976-77 regime shift, but the mechanisms responsible
  remain unknown. On the west coast, warm periods after the 1989-90 climate change
  resulted in an influx of predators that caused large increases in juvenile mortalities.
  It is impossible to forecast the actual changes in the marine ecosystems; thus,
  the degree to which chinook marine survival may be affected is unknown. The
  abruptness of change in the Strait of Georgia and the west coast is of concern
  because it indicates that signals of change need to be detected quickly and
  managed effectively (Beamish et al., 1997). </p>
