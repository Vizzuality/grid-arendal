<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>Scenarios produced by these transient experiments varied widely among models
  and from region to region, both for temperature and precipitation. Except for
  a few outliers, individual values of projected surface warming varied mostly
  in the range of ~1 to ~5°C [<a href="307.htm#figureB-1">Figure B-1</a> (a,c)]-with
  the NCAR(r) and MPI(q) runs showing the least temperature sensitivity because,
  with a 1% linear increase in CO<sub>2</sub>/year (Table B-1), CO<sub>2</sub> has increased only by
  a factor of 1.7 by the end of the 70-year simulation, compared to a doubling
  for the other model runs. For most regions, the inter-model range of simulated
  temperature increase was rather pronounced, about 3-5°C. With the exception
  of one or two outliers, the smallest inter-model range of simulated warming
  at the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling was over Australia in summer and the Sahel in winter,
  where the scenarios differed among models by no more than 1.3°C. It should be
  noted, however, that for a region such as Australia continental-scale agreement
  may come from canceling differences at the sub-continental scale. </p>
<p>The surface air temperature biases had positive and negative values both in
  winter and summer [<a href="307.htm#figureB-1">Figure B-1</a> (b,d)]. However,
  biases were mostly negative in winter and positive in summer, an indication
  that the models tended to overestimate the seasonal temperature cycles. Most
  biases were in the range of -7 to 10°C, but values as large as ~15°C were found.
  The smallest biases were found over Australia and, with the exception of one
  or two models, South East Asia and Southern Europe. Over most regions, the inter-model
  range of temperature biases was of the order of 10°C (i.e., it was greater than
  the inter-model range of regional temperature increase). The surface temperature
  biases as well as the simulated regional warming scenarios were in the same
  range as those reported in IPCC (1990) for a number of equilibrium runs. </p>
<p>Regional precipitation biases spanned a wide range, with values as extreme
  as ~-90% or greater than 200% [<a href="307.htm#figureB-1">Figure B-1</a> (f,h)].
  The biases were generally larger in winter than in summer, and, overall, regions
  with the smallest biases were Southern Europe, Northern Europe, and Central
  North America. Regions receiving low winter precipitation (e.g., Sahel, South
  East Asia) tended to have large positive or negative biases, because small errors
  in control run values appear as large biases when reported in percentage terms.
</p>
<p>Simulated precipitation sensitivity to doubled CO<sub>2</sub> was mostly in the range
  of -20 to 20% of the control value [<a href="307.htm#figureB-1">Figure B-1</a>
  (e,g)]. The most salient features of simulated regional precipitation changes
  are summarized as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>All models agreed in summer precipitation increases over East Asia and,
    except for one model, South East Asia-reflecting an enhancement of summer
    monsoonal flow (contrast this result to the experiments that include the effects
    of sulfate aerosols; see discussion below in relation to <a href="310.htm#figureB-2">Figure
    B-2</a>).</li>
  <li>All models agreed in winter precipitation increases over Northern Europe,
    East Asia, and, except for one model, Southern Europe. In the other cases,
    agreement was not found among models even on the sign of the simulated change.</li>
  <li>Regions with the smallest inter-model range of simulated precipitation change
    were Central North America, East Asia, and Northern Europe in summer and Southern
    Europe, Northern Europe, and East Asia in winter.</li>
  <li>Overall, the precipitation biases were greater than the simulated changes.
    A rigorous statistical analysis of the model results in <a href="307.htm#figureB-1">Figure
    B-1</a> has not been carried out; however, it can be expected that, due to
    relatively high temporal and spatial variability in precipitation, temperature
    changes are more likely to be statistically significant than precipitation
    changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, several instances occurred in which regional scenarios produced
  by all models agreed, at least in sign. In fact, regardless of whether flux
  correction was used, the range of model sensitivity was less than the range
  of biases (note that the scales in <a href="307.htm#figureB-1">Figure B-1</a>
  are different for the sensitivities and the biases). However, the range of simulated
  scenarios of the model regional biases were still large, so that confidence
  in regional scenarios simulated by AOGCMs remains low. It should be pointed
  out that, while model agreement increases our confidence in the veracity of
  model responses, it does not necessarily guarantee their correctness because
  of possible systematic errors or deficiencies shared by all models. On the other
  hand, in spite of these errors, models are useful tools to study climate sensitivity
  (see IPCC 1996, WG I, Chapter 5). Even though models cannot exactly reproduce
  many details of today's climate, key processes that we know to exist in the
  real climate system are represented in these models (see IPCC 1996, WG I, Chapter
  4). For example, the simulation of the seasonal cycle of winds, temperature,
  pressure, and humidity in both the horizontal and vertical provides us with
  a first-order qualification of the fidelity of the models' ability to capture
  these basic features of the Earth's climate. As another example, AOGCMs exhibit
  the ability to simulate essential responses of the climate system to various
  forcings (e.g., those involving El Niño sea surface temperature anomalies and
  aerosols from volcanic activity). This increases our confidence in the use of
  AOGCM sensitivity experiments to evaluate potential changes in important climate
  processes. </p>
