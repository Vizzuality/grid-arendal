<h4>2.3.1.4. Forest and Woodland Ecosystems</h4>
<p>Forests in Africa are of great socioeconomic importance as sources of timber,
  fuel, and many nonwood products, as well as for the protection of water resources.
  Ecologically, they serve critical roles in water, carbon, and nutrient cycling.
  The impacts of climate change on forests at the continental scale will be assessed
  in very broad terms using biome distribution models. <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In geological time scales, forest boundaries fluctuated a great deal during
  the Pleistocene epoch (Sayer et al., 1992); the forests of Africa even now are
  considerably more extensive than they were during the most recent high-latitude
  glacial advance about 18,000 years ago. Environmental conditions in tropical
  Africa at about 18,000 before present (BP) are quite well known, thanks to a
  large number of pollen and plant microfossil studies (see Hamilton, 1988, for
  more details). During the severe arid period around 18,000 BP, core areas (centers
  of biotic diversity) were the main centers of forest survival. Two such principal
  core areas are located in Cameroon/Gabon and eastern Democratic Republic of
  Congo (DRC) (formerly Zaire); other, less-diverse core areas are in west Africa
  and near the east African coast (Sayer et al., 1992). The core areas are not
  only rich in numbers of species and endemics but also are centers of distribution
  of disjunct species. Some of these species are unlikely to be able to disperse
  from core area to core area without continuous forest cover. For example, gorillas
  are disjunctly distributed across the Zaire basin (Figures <a href="014.htm#figure2-6">2-6</a>
  , <a href="014.htm#figure2-7">2-7</a> and <a href="014.htm#figure2-8">2-8</a>).
  Although the forests between the two populations seem suitable for the species,
  some explanation is needed regarding how their ranges became fragmented. A likely
  explanation for the gorilla and other obligate forest species is that their
  ranges became fragmented as a result of forest retraction at times of aridity
  and that these species subsequently have been slow to expand their range to
  include all potentially suitable habitat. Thus, animal species may not adapt
  fast enough to rapid changes in climate. </p>

  Current vegetation distribution can be studied using biome distribution models.
  Biome distribution models such as MAPSS (Neilson, 1995) and BIOME3 (Haxeltine
  and Prentice, 1996) simulate the distribution of potential global vegetation
  based on local vegetation and hydrological processes and the properties of plants.
  They simulate the mixture of life forms (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses)
  that can coexist at a site while in competition with each other for light and
  water. These models simulate the maximum carrying capacity, or vegetation density
  (in the form of leaf area), that can be supported at the site under the constraints
  of energy and water. A change in leaf area can be interpreted as a change in
  overall carrying capacity or standing crop of the site, regardless of whether
  it is potential natural vegetation or under cultivation. This carrying capacity
  potential is the basis for application of these models to all of Africa to indicate
  possible shifts in agricultural or vegetation potential. </p>
<p>MAPSS and BIOME3 outputs were generated (see <a href="315.htm">Annex C</a>) using several GCM scenarios,
  with and without CO<sub>2</sub> effects and aerosol emissions. <a href="014.htm#figure2-1">Table
  2-1</a> summarizes changes in areal coverage for four main biome types in Africa
  (the shrub/woodlands biome was combined with grasslands). The models indicate
  a net shift from more arid biomes (low leaf area index-LAI) to more mesic biomes
  (higher LAI) for the OSU, GFDL, and UKMO scenarios. Exact percentages of change
  and where this change would occur are highly uncertain because the models indicate
  potential, not actual, vegetation. <br>

<p>The biome models are able to capture some overall divisions (e.g., rainforest
  versus woodland versus arid), but they do not yet capture fine-scale detail
  for Africa. This limitation is a result of the quality of the climate data used
  as inputs, coarse soils information, and the nature of the models-which were
  primarily designed to describe vegetation in temperate climates. </p>
<p>Biome distribution models simulate only static vegetation (i.e., equilibrium
  vegetation at a future date). Factors that affect vegetation dynamics, such
  as competition and disturbance (fire, herbivory), are not considered. These
  factors have not yet been incorporated in global vegetation models (but see
  Woodward and Steffen, 1996, for plans and developments in this area). An important
  factor to consider with regard to whether a vegetation type can respond as simulated
  is migration. Migrating species would require corridors of unmanaged land. The
  fragmented nature of remaining African vegetation (outside the rainforests)
  would make vegetation responses to climate change difficult. The destructive
  aspects of fires also would reduce migration. The dynamics of savannas and woodlands
  (such as miombo) are strongly linked to fires, so likely changes in fire intensity
  and frequency will have unknown consequences on vegetation. </p>
<p>Some progress is being made in the development of models of vegetation dynamics
  that include the effects of fire and herbivory for African vegetation (e.g.,
  Menaut et al., 1991; Van Dalaan and Shugart, 1989; Desanker, 1996). However,
  these models have to be widely tested and validated before they can be used
  to evaluate impacts of climate change at the broad scale. Results of biogeochemical
  modeling in savannas using the CENTURY model of Parton et al. (1992) are discussed
  in <a href="015.htm">Section 2.3.1.5</a>. </p>
