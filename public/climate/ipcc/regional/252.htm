<h4>9.3.5.2. Fisheries </h4>
<p>Fishing, although largely artisinal or small-scale commercial, is an important
  activity on most small islands (Blommestein et al., 1996; Mahon, 1996). Although
  marine fisheries only account for approximately 1% of the global economy, many
  coastal and island states are far more dependent on the sector than this statistic
  would suggest (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 16.1.1). For example, the annual yield
  of lobsters from the shelves and banks of the Caribbean islands (excluding the
  U.S. Virgin Islands) has a retail value in restaurants of approximately US$40
  million (Vicente, 1996). Similarly, marine fish account for 16% of global animal
  protein consumption, but the contribution to protein intake is much greater
  in developing countries, where animal protein tends to be relatively expensive
  (Lauretti, 1992; Weber, 1993, 1994; IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 16.2.4). </p>
<p>The modest temperature increases projected for these regions are not anticipated
  to have a widespread adverse effect on small island fisheries. However, a temperature
  rise could have a negative effect on productivity in areas-such as shallow lagoons-where
  hypersalinity may occur, especially if juveniles are sensitive to salinity or
  temperature (Alm et al., 1993). On the other hand, warming-induced changes in
  current patterns might increase upwellings at sea, bringing more nutrients to
  the surface and providing more food for the fish (Aparicio, 1993; Bakun, 1993;
  Chakalall, 1993; Maul, 1993). </p>
<p>There is some evidence that clam and sea-turtle fisheries could be sensitive
  to sea temperature changes. Clams, like corals, are known to suffer from bleaching
  with the expulsion of symbiotic algae, as a result of excesses in temperature
  or radiation (Gomez and Belda, 1988; Lucas et al., 1988). Bleaching would cause
  "loss of productivity or devastation in stocks of growout clams on the reef-flats"
  (Wilkinson and Buddemeier, 1994). One possible option to minimize this possibility
  in locations where commercial clam mariculture is practiced (e.g., the Solomon
  Islands, Palau, Samoa) in deeper water, where light and temperature fluctuations
  would be reduced. This measure, however, will result in lower growth rates and
  reduced returns to the grower (Lucas et al., 1988; Wilkinson and Buddemeier,
  1994). In the case of sea turtles, most species nest during the summer, when
  temperatures are close to the organisms' upper thermal limit. It is uncertain
  whether turtles will be able to adapt to warmer temperatures by nesting in the
  cooler months (Limpus, 1993). If such adaptation is not possible, increased
  temperatures are likely to result in a higher ratio of females to males because
  the sex ratio of sea turtles is directly determined by temperature (Wilkinson
  and Buddemeier, 1994). </p>
<p>Generally, fisheries in the small island states are not expected to be adversely
  affected by sea-level rise per se. A higher sea level would be a critical factor
  for fisheries only if the rate of rise were far more rapid than current projections
  suggest. In such circumstances, the natural succession of coastal ecosystems
  on which some species depend (e.g., mangroves, seagrasses, corals) would be
  disrupted (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 16.2.2.1). In tropical islands, these ecosystems
  function as nurseries and forage sites for a variety of commercially important
  species. Fish production obviously would suffer if these habitats were endangered
  or lost (Costa et al., 1994). </p>
