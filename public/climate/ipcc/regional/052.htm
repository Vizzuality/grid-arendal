<p>(continued...)</p>
<p>A number of marine mammals depend explicitly on ice cover. For example, the
  extent of the polar bear's habitat is determined by the maximum seasonal surface
  area of marine ice in a given year. The disappearance of or a major reduction
  in ice cover would threaten the very survival of the polar bear, as well as
  certain marine seals. Similarly, a reduction in ice cover would reduce food
  supplies for seals and walruses and increase their vulnerability to natural
  predators and human hunters and poachers. Other animals, such as the sea otter,
  could benefit by moving into new territories with reduced ice (IPCC 1996, WG
  II, Section 8.3.2). </p>
<p>Furthermore, many species of penguins and seals that are dependent upon krill
  production in the Southern Ocean use coastal areas as breeding sites. Year-class
  strength of krill is closely related to climate change or sea-ice distribution,
  and the growth, survival, and hatching rates of penguin chicks or seal pups
  at the rookery are directly influenced by krill abundance in the sea. </p>
<p>Animals that migrate great distances-as do most of the great whales and seabirds-are
  subject to possible disruptions in the distribution and timing of their food
  sources during migration. It remains unclear how the contraction of ice cover
  would affect the migration routes of animals that normally follow the ice front.
  The timing and order of whale migration, for instance, may be influenced by
  changes in sea-ice cover, with subsequent impacts on their energetics (e.g.,
  feeding and reproductive biology). At least some migrating species may respond
  rapidly to new situations; for example, migrating ducks have altered their routes
  to take advantage of the recent exploding population of zebra mussels in the
  Great Lakes (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 8.3.2). </p>
<p>Many pelagic marine mammals (e.g., the great whales) are able to locate and
  follow seasonal centers of food production that frequently change from year
  to year because of local oceanographic conditions. Similarly, their migrations
  may change to accommodate interannual differences in environmental conditions.
  However, some marine mammal stocks (e.g., seals and sea lions) have life histories
  that tie them to specific geographic features (e.g., pupping beaches or ice
  fields). Although they have some flexibility in their need for specific habitats,
  some marine mammals may be more severely affected than others by changes in
  the availability of necessary habitats and prey species that result from climate
  change. </p>
<p>With sea-level rise, marine mammal calving and pupping beaches may disappear
  from areas where there are no alternatives. Some species will be able to take
  advantage of increases in prey abundance and spatial/temporal shifts in prey
  distribution toward or within their primary habitats. Conversely, some populations
  of birds and seals will be adversely affected by climatic changes if food sources
  decline or are displaced away from regions suitable for breeding or rearing
  of young (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 8.3.2). </p>
<p>Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that the extent of seasonal sea ice,
  at least in some areas of the Northern Hemisphere, is retreating. This information,
  coupled with predictions of warming from GCMs, suggests that current barriers
  to gene flow among marine mammal stocks in the Arctic may change dramatically
  in the next 50 years. Although this shift may not result in a reduction in abundance
  at the species level, it could very well change the underlying population structure
  of many species of Arctic whales and seals, which will greatly affect their
  management. </p>
<p>Although the impacts of these ecological changes are likely to be significant,
  they cannot be reliably forecast or evaluated. Climate change may have positive
  and negative impacts, even on the same species. Positive effects such as extended
  feeding areas and seasons in higher latitudes, more-productive high latitudes,
  and lower winter mortality may be offset by negative factors that alter established
  reproductive patterns, breeding habitats, disease vectors, migration routes,
  and ecosystem relationships (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 8.3.2). </p>
