<h1>2.3. Vulnerabilities and Potential Impacts for Key Sectors </h1>
<h4>2.3.1. Terrestrial Ecosystems<a name="terrestrial"></a></h4>
<h4>2.3.1.1. Introduction<a name="intro"></a></h4>
<p>Numerous schemes have been used to describe Africa's vegetation and ecosystems.
  White's (1983) classification system is used here, aggregated (after Justice
  et al., 1994) to show the rainforest in central Africa (unmarked) and two major
  categories of woodland savannas divided by moisture and nutrient level: broad-leafed,
  nutrient-poor, moist savannas; and fine-leafed, nutrient-rich, arid savannas
  (<a href="#figure2-5">Figure 2-5</a>). This aggregation summarizes current understanding
  of the role of soil nutrients and moisture on vegetation distribution in Africa,
  especially in savannas (Scholes and Walker, 1993). The broad-leafed savannas
  include the extensive miombo woodlands of central and southern Africa. Nutritionally
  poor soils support only low-quality grass for grazing, so the numbers of large
  herbivores is low in miombo and other broad-leafed savannas (Frost, 1996). The
  fine-leafed savannas include acacia-dominated thorn woodlands, which have higher-quality
  grass and so support large numbers of large herbivores; these areas constitute
  the main rangeland region. <br>

<p>Africa is composed essentially of woodlands and grasslands, with rainforests
  occupying only about 7% of the land area. Africa's rainforests represent slightly
  less than one-fifth of the total remaining rainforest in the world; Asia and
  Latin America contain the rest (Sayer et al., 1992). Only about a third of Africa's
  historical forest extent remains, with west Africa's forests being lost faster
  than those of any other region. Annual deforestation rates average 0.7% per
  annum (FAO, 1997). </p>
<p>WRI (1996) indicates that only 8% (0.5 million km<sup>2</sup>) of Africa's regional forest
  remains as "frontier forest." (Frontier forest is essentially natural/primary
  forest of sufficient size to support ecologically viable populations of indigenous
  species.) More than 90% of west Africa's original forest has been lost, and
  only a small part of what remains qualifies as frontier forest. Of the remaining
  forest, 77% is under moderate or high threat from logging and commercial hunting
  to meet growing urban demand for bushmeat. Demands on forests also have escalated
  in some regions (e.g., as a result of civil unrest that has pushed hundreds
  of thousands of people into previously intact forest). </p>
<p>Many studies of African ecosystems emphasize particular vegetation types-savanna
  grasslands, miombo woodlands, mopane woodlands, rangelands, or rainforest-or
  particular regions: the Sahel, sub-Saharan Africa, or the Southern African Development
  Community (SADC). In general, the structure of Africa's vegetation is determined
  by climate at the large scale, then soil type (texture) and nutrient levels
  at the local scale (Scholes and Walker, 1993). Fire and herbivory are important
  disturbance factors. Increased moisture in drier areas will likely result in
  a complex set of feedbacks between nutrients, fire occurrence, decomposition,
  and competing vegetation. </p>
<p>Increased variability in rainfall and changes in temperature will likely disrupt
  key ecosystem processes such as phenology and will influence insect pests and
  diseases in mostly unknown ways. Direct effects on pests will involve disruption
  of insect life cycles or creation of more suitable conditions for new pests
  (or for old pests to expand their territory). Ticks, tsetse flies, and locusts
  are notable examples of serious insect pests in Africa. Although a lot of work
  has been done to study these insects, a lot remains to be done, especially in
  relation to how climate change may impact them. </p>
<h4>2.3.1.2. Climatic Driving Forces <a name="climatic"></a></h4>
<p>Of the many climatic factors that are important for plant growth, among the
  most significant in relation to climate change are temperature, water availability
  (determined by precipitation and soil characteristics, as well as other meteorological
  variables), and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations. Consideration of the effects
  of climate change requires examination of the direct effects of changes in CO<sub>2</sub>
  concentrations and climate variables on the growth of plants, as well as the
  ways in which these direct effects are modified by soil feedbacks and biological
  interactions among different organisms. </p>
<p>The effects of temperature changes will vary in different subregions and ecosystems.
  An increase in temperatures will reduce the incidence of frost damage in areas
  where this damage occurs and widen the potential geographical range of species
  that are limited by minimum temperatures. The extent of effects of higher temperatures
  on African vegetation (e.g., effects on respiration rates, membrane damage)
  is largely uncertain. Temperature is known to interact with CO<sub>2</sub> concentration,
  so expected increases in respiration resulting from a temperature increase alone
  may be offset or even reduced by higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (Wullschleger and
  Norby, 1992). </p>
<p>In most of Africa, water availability is projected to have the greatest impact
  on plant processes. Individual species are adapted to particular water regimes
  and may perform poorly and possibly die out in conditions to which they are
  poorly adapted (e.g., Hinckley et al., 1981). The effects of climate change
  will vary-depending, for example, on how particular plant types use water (water-use
  efficiency, WUE) or the amount of water available in the soil. Plants are grouped
  into C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>, and CAM plant types depending on how the process of photosynthesis
  takes place (see IPCC 1996, WG II, Section A.2.2). C<sub>3</sub> plants (which include
  most trees and crop species such as wheat, rice, barley, cassava, and potato)
  have relatively poor WUE, unlike C<sub>4</sub> plants (most of the tropical grasses and
  agricultural species such as maize, sugarcane, and sorghum). Higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentration
  will likely improve water-use efficiency and growth in C<sub>3</sub> plants in water-limited
  environments. C<sub>4</sub> and CAM plants (including desert plants such as cacti) are
  unlikely to be affected directly by changes in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. </p>
<p>The amount of water available to plants over the course of the year affects
  plant growth and location across soil and climate types. Available soil water
  (in combination, of course, with other factors) generally controls the growth
  cycle (beginning and end) and other events such as when to leaf, shed leaves,
  set buds, and so forth. Water availability and temperature indices and parameters
  (maxima and minima, heat sums, cold sums) have been used to relate the distribution
  of vegetation formations to climatic factors (for more details on these plant
  biogeography models, see <a href="014.htm">Section 2.3.1.4</a>). However, large
  uncertainties in GCM precipitation projections constrain our ability to project
  ecosystem responses to changes in climate. Thus, improving climate modeling
  at the regional scale is a priority in most of Africa, where ecosystem processes
  are limited by moisture. </p>
