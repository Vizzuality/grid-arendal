<h4>8.3.4.4. Direct and Indirect Effects </h4>
<p><i>The results of a large number of experiments designed to examine the effects
  of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on crops have generally confirmed high confidence
  in a net beneficial effect of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization, up to some level. Sustained
  plant response under field conditions to concentrations beyond 2xCO<sub>2</sub> would likely
  be dependent on species as well as water and nutrient status and is highly uncertain.</i>
</p>
<p>A mean value yield response of C<sub>3</sub> crops (most crops except maize, sugar cane,
  millet, and sorghum) to doubled CO<sub>2</sub> is reported to be approximately +30% (range
  -10% to +80%). There is reason to expect, however, that this value represents
  an upper estimate unlikely to be achieved under field conditions. Factors known
  to affect the magnitude of CO<sub>2</sub> response in crops include the availability of
  plant nutrients, the crop species, temperature, precipitation, and other environmental
  factors, such as air pollution, soil quality, weeds, insect pests, and diseases
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.2.1). Increased WUE is a result of elevated CO<sub>2</sub>
  as well, though in many regions of North America, higher temperatures associated
  with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> can be expected to increase evaporative demand and transpiration,
  resulting in minimal benefit from the increase in WUE (Brklacich et al., 1997b).
</p>
<p>Changes in soils (e.g., loss of soil organic matter, leaching of soil nutrients,
  salinization, and erosion) are likely consequences of climate change for some
  soils in some climatic zones. Cropping practices such as crop rotation, conservation
  tillage, and improved nutrient management are technically effective in combating
  or reversing such deleterious effects (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.3; Matson
  et al., 1997). </p>
<p>Livestock production could be affected by changes in grain prices, changes
  in the prevalence and distribution of livestock pests, and changes in grazing
  and pasture productivity. Livestock are sensitive to stress from warmer, drier
  conditions, as well as reduced range forage quality and water availability.
  Warmer winter temperatures may enhance winter survival of range livestock. Taking
  action to improve forage quality or water supply could benefit livestock. Analyses
  indicate that intensively managed livestock systems such as those in North America
  have more potential for adaptation than crop systems because of their mobility
  in terms of access to food and water (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.5). </p>
<p><i>The risk of losses due to weeds, insects, and diseases is sensitive to temperature
  and moisture (including rainfall, humidity, and dew); the risk is likely to
  increase in subregions where these factors become more favorable for specific
  disease organisms but may decrease under drier conditions. Increased climate
  variability may provide additional challenges for pest-management adaptation
  to climate change.</i> </p>
<p>Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels may enhance the growth of C<sub>3</sub> weeds, based on the results
  of controlled exposure experiments. Evidence also exists, however, that other
  factors determining plant productivity may be more important in controlling
  plant response in the field (e.g., water- and nutrient-use efficiency) than
  the differential CO<sub>2</sub> response (Bazzaz and McConnaughay, 1992). There currently
  is little experimental evidence to directly evaluate the effects of elevated
  CO<sub>2</sub> on weed infestation, insect pests, or plant diseases under field conditions.
  Less severe winters may increase the range and severity of insect and disease
  infestations. Temperature and moisture are critical to the spread and development
  of many plant diseases (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.4.3). Successful disease
  development requires convergence of a susceptible host, a virulent pathogen,
  and suitable environmental conditions. Increased variability of precipitation,
  for example, could affect the host-parasite interaction positively or negatively,
  leading to more or less disease development (Shriner, 1980). Increased climate
  variability also could render less effective disease-forecasting models currently
  used to manage some diseases and require increased reliance on pesticides. North
  American agriculture will need to address these concerns in the context of increasing
  pressure on agriculture to reduce chemical inputs. </p>
