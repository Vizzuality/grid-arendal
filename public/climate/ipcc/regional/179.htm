<p><i>Projected changes in climate could increase risks to property and human
  health/life as a result of changes in exposure to natural hazards (e.g., wildfire,
  landslides, and extreme weather events)</i>. A large and increasing number of
  people and their property in North America are vulnerable to natural hazards.
  Projected changes in wildfires and landslides could increase property losses
  and increase disruptions and damages to urban and industrial infrastructure
  (e.g., road and rail transportation and pipeline systems). Although some questions
  remain regarding the extent and regional reflections of changes in extreme weather
  events as a result of climate changes, projected changes in the frequency or
  intensity of these events are of concern because of the implications for social
  and economic costs in a number of sectors. For example, extreme weather events
  can cause direct physical harm to humans; disrupt health infrastructure, causing
  contamination of water systems and creating breeding sites for insects or favorable
  conditions for rodents that carry diseases; and affect construction costs, insurance
  fees and settlement costs, and offshore oil and gas exploration and extraction
  costs. </p>
<p><i>Climate warming could result in increased demand for cooling energy and
  decreased demand for heating energy, with the overall net effect varying among
  geographic regions. Changes in energy demand for comfort, however, are expected
  to result in a net saving overall for North America.</i> Projected increases
  in temperature could reduce energy use associated with space heating [e.g.,
  a 1°C increase in temperature could reduce U.S. space-heating energy use by
  11% of demand, resulting in a cost saving of $5.5 billion (1991$US)]. It also
  has been projected that a 4°C warming could decrease site energy use for commercial-sector
  heating and cooling by 13-17% and associated primary energy by 2-7%, depending
  on the degree to which advanced building designs penetrate the market. If peak
  demand for electricity occurs in the winter, maximum demand is likely to fall
  as a result of projected temperature changes, whereas if there is a summer peak,
  maximum demand will rise. </p>
<p><i>The technological capacity to adapt to climate change is likely to be readily
  available in North America, but its application will be realized only if the
  necessary information is available (sufficiently far in advance in relation
  to the planning horizons and lifetimes of investments) and the institutional
  and financial capacity to manage change exists.</i> Some adaptations can be
  made without explicit climate predictions through increasing the resilience
  of systems, such as greater flood control, larger water reservoirs, and so forth,
  but these approaches are not without social and economic costs. Rapid changes
  in climate and associated acceleration of sea-level rise would limit adaptation
  options, thereby putting considerable strain on social and economic systems
  and increasing the need for explicit adaptation strategies. </p>
<p><b>Human Health</b> (<a href="230.htm">Section 8.3.9</a>). Climate can have
  wide-ranging and potentially adverse effects on human health through direct
  pathways (e.g., thermal stress and extreme weather/climate events) and indirect
  pathways (e.g., disease vectors and infectious agents, environmental and occupational
  exposures to toxic substances, and food production). </p>
<p><i>Direct health effects include increased heat-related mortality and illness
  and the beneficial effects of milder winters on cold-related mortality.</i>
  Under a warmer North America, current models indicate that by the middle of
  the next century, many major cities could experience as many as several hundred
  to thousands of extra heat-related deaths annually. The elderly, persons with
  preexisting health conditions, and the very young (0-4 years) are most vulnerable
  to heat stress. Gradual acclimatization to increasing temperatures, the use
  of air conditioners, and an adequate warning system for heat waves may help
  reduce heat-related deaths. Conversely, it has been suggested that winter mortality
  rates may decrease in the future with warmer winter temperatures. </p>
<p><i>Climate warming may exacerbate respiratory disorders associated with reduced
  air quality and affects the seasonality of certain allergic respiratory disorders.</i>
  Concurrent hot weather and exposure to air pollutants can have synergistic impacts
  on health. Recent studies show a positive correlation between ground-level ozone
  and respiratory-related hospital admissions in the United States and Canada.
  Increased temperatures under climate change could lead to a greater number of
  days on which ozone levels exceed air quality standards. Global warming also
  may alter the production of plant aero-allergens, intensifying the severity
  of seasonal allergies. </p>
<p><i>Changing climate conditions may lead to the northward spread of vector-borne
  infectious diseases and potentially enhanced transmission dynamics due to warmer
  ambient temperatures.</i> Vector-borne infectious diseases (e.g., malaria, dengue
  fever, encephalitis) and waterborne diarrheal diseases currently cause a large
  proportion of global fatalities. Temperature increases under climate change
  are expected to enlarge the potential transmission zones of these vectors into
  temperate regions of North America. Some increases in waterborne diseases may
  occur due to changes in water distribution, temperature, and microorganism proliferation
  under climate change. However, the North American health infrastructure likely
  would prevent a large increase in the actual number of vector-borne and waterborne
  disease cases. </p>
<p><b>Integrative Issues</b> (<a href="236.htm">Section 8.4</a>). Taken individually,
  responses to any one of the impacts discussed here may be within the capabilities
  of a subregion or sector. The fact that they are projected to occur simultaneously
  and in concert with changes in population, technology, and economics and other
  environmental and social changes, however, adds to the complexity of the impact
  assessment and the choice of appropriate responses. </p>
<p>This assessment highlights a number of the uncertainties that currently limit
  our capability to understand the vulnerability of subregions and sectors of
  North America and to develop and implement adaptive strategies to reduce that
  vulnerability. The following research and monitoring activities are considered
  key to reducing these uncertainties: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve regional and subregional projections of climate change that consider
    the physiographic characteristics that play a significant role in the North
    American climate (e.g., the Great Lakes, the nature of the coasts, and mountain
    ranges), and incorporate biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks.</li>
  <li>Improve projections of changes in weather systems and variability, including
    extremes.</li>
  <li>Develop a better understanding of physiological and ecosystem processes,
    with particular emphasis on direct CO<sub>2</sub> effects and how the CO<sub>2</sub> effects might
    be enhanced or diminished by nitrogen-cycle dynamics.</li>
  <li>Identify sensitivities and relative vulnerabilities of natural and social
    systems, including the availability of the necessary physical, biological,
    chemical, and social data and information.</li>
  <li>Identify beneficial impacts or opportunities that may arise as a result
    of climate change.</li>
  <li>Develop integrated assessments of impacts.</li>
  <li>Define viable response options that recognize the differentiated and integrative
    nature of the impacts and response options and the specific needs of sectors
    and subregions of North America.</li>
</ul>
