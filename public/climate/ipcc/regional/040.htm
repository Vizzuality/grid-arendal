<h1>2.4. Integrated Assessment of Potential Impacts </h1>
<p>Work on integrated assessment of climate change in the Africa region is in
  its infancy. Several different approaches are being applied in country studies
  and primary research. These approaches include assessments of illustrative case
  examples related to ecosystems, water supply/basin management, and socioeconomic
  activities such as agriculture. These case studies begin to integrate, for specific
  subregions (such as watersheds or agricultural production areas), the impacts
  of climate change with the potential impacts of other factors such as land-use
  change, demographic change, land degradation, air and water pollution, and economic
  and social change (including factors such as changing resource demands resulting
  from economic development and technological change). </p>
<p>The use of integrated assessment models has not been widespread in the African
  context, although it is becoming an item on the agenda of several modeling groups
  and organizations. More widespread use of integrated assessment models is a
  priority for the IPCC in the Third Assessment Report, although it will require
  fundamental advances in the research literature. As a basis for integration,
  primary research on impacts on the potentially most vulnerable sectors and regions
  must be conducted so that interactions among the many potential costs and benefits
  can be assessed and, where possible, quantified. </p>
<h1>2.5. Major Challenges Ahead for Africa<a name="major"></a> </h1>
<p>One of the first and most pressing scientific steps to address the shortage
  of data on African climate is the maintenance and (if possible) enhancement
  of the surface climate observing network. The network is important because,
  for the detection of long-term climate change, stable and continuous observing
  sites are necessary. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has a program
  to designate and maintain key sites as Reference Climate Stations. This program
  needs additional recognition and funding. The observing network also will help
  in the calibration of new satellite-based methods of observing the climate (WMO,
  1992). </p>
<p>There is a continual need to evaluate the results of GCM experiments that simulate
  greenhouse gas- and aerosol-induced climate change to identify the likely subregional
  response within Africa to projected global-mean warming. This research should
  be seen as only one part of the much larger effort underway worldwide to narrow
  the uncertainties surrounding predictions of greenhouse gas-induced climate
  change. Determining whether recent desiccation in the Sahel is associated in
  some way with global air pollution also is of great importance (Hastenrath,
  1995; Ringius et al., 1996). </p>
<p>In addition to conducting more comprehensive assessments of the sensitivity
  and vulnerability of key resource sectors and systems, there is an urgent need
  to begin to apply existing and developing techniques for integration of potential
  climate change impacts on several dimensions, as suggested in the introduction
  to this report. These dimensions include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Integrating the chain of effects from changes in atmospheric composition
    and climate to changes in biophysical systems to the socioeconomic consequences
    (the "vertical" dimension)</li>
  <li>Including interactions among systems, sectors, and activities (the "horizontal"
    dimension)</li>
  <li>Considering climate change in the context of other trends and changes in
    society (the "time" or "global change" dimension)</li>
  <li>Considering the integrated impacts of current levels and episodes of climate
    variability.</li>
</ul>
<p>In light of the large number and magnitude of socioeconomic and environmental
  changes projected for Africa, developing integrated assessments of climate change
  is an urgent priority for the region. <br>

      Diseases: The Case of Malaria</td>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Malaria is a vector-borne environmental disease; as such, it is greatly
	influenced by macro- and microenvironmental changes. The impact of human-induced
	environmental change on malaria can be graded on a scale that commences
	at a global level and terminates at the level of an individual family
	homestead. In the investigation of environmentally induced changes in
	malaria transmission, it is impossible to restrict the study to localized
	environmental changes because they are nested within the changing macroenvironment.
	To understand the dynamics of these changes, as well as their interactions
	and their potential for prediction of occurrence, it is essential that
	we consider the role of macroenvironmental change (e.g., global warming)
	as well as microenvironmental change (e.g., deforestation or changes in
	land-use patterns, housing type, migration). <a name="figure2-15"></a><br>

      <p>There is little doubt that global warming is now a reality (IPCC 1990,
	Chapters 5, 7, 8). Over the past three decades there has been a marked
	increase in mean temperatures, especially at higher latitudes; in the
	tropics, the increase is estimated to be about 0.2°C (IPCC 1990, Chapter 5). Some attention has focused on global climate change and its implications
	for epidemic malaria transmission (Bouma et al., 1994; Martens et al.,
	1995a; Martin and Lefebvre, 1995). The impact of these climatic changes
	on malaria is likely to be greatest in regions where malaria transmission
	previously was limited physiologically by low temperatures, which limit
	the development of the vector and the parasite. In these areas, transmission
	is likely to be limited to specific seasons (when temperatures are favorable)
	or may not occur at all. Increased temperatures will lengthen the transmission
	season, resulting in a marked increase in incidence. Increased temperatures
	also can expand transmission into regions that previously defined the
	limits of malaria transmission because of the effects of latitude or elevation
	(or both). </p>
      <p>Studies in Rwanda (Loevinsohn, 1994) and Kenya (Knight and Neville, 1991;
	Some, 1994) have investigated the extent to which small-scale land-use
	changes can be responsible for dramatic increases in highland malaria.
	The effects of short-term environmental changes, as well as changes in
	human behavioral patterns (e.g., migration, changes in control activities
	in adjacent regions), are superimposed on more general effects of macroenvironmental
	change and are likely to play an important role in the onset of epidemics.
	Thus, although climate change may mean certain regions become more susceptible
	to malaria transmission, the actual risk of epidemics may remain low because
	of the absence of local contributory risk factors. </p>
      <p>The accompanying figures a, b, c, and d provide a delineation of regions
	that would be environmentally affected by 0.5°C and 1.0°C increases in
	temperature. Figures a and b limit the modeling process to the highland
	areas of Africa, whereas Figures c and d include regions in which malaria
	distribution previously was restricted by elevation and latitude. These
	"new" zones of malaria transmission would be intermediate between areas
	of known annual transmission and those where malaria has never occurred.
	With respect to the latter (the upper limit), the simulation errs on the
	side of caution: Malaria always is limited (cannot occur at present) and
	is not subject to interannual variation. It uses existing long-term, retrospective,
	climatological (temperature and rainfall) and topographic surfaces that
	already exist for Africa (Hutchinson et al., 1995). Inherent in the prerequisite
	for such epidemic fringe malaria (elevation or latitude) is that in certain
	years a window of suitable environmental conditions will exist. This window
	consists of a number of consecutive months with suitable environmental
	conditions. The graphic provides a conservative estimate; it assumes a
	prerequisite of five consecutive months, whereas in some regions (such
	as the Sahel) this may be as short as three (Bagayako, pers. comm.). Despite
	the occurrence of such a window, transmission may not occur. Transmission
	then will be contingent on human activities that result in the introduction
	of the parasite into this suitable (short-term) climatological environment.
      </p>
      <p>The premise that climate variables, on their own, may not always reliably
	predict epidemic risk has important implications for the forecasting of
	epidemics and changes in distribution. This model is not definitive but
	provides an illustration of how climate may impact upon disease distribution
	and how regions of impact may be delineated. Similarly, the change or
	shift in severity in existing malarial regions could be modeled. The figures
	illustrate that increased temperatures would significantly increase susceptible
	regions in areas of the Southern Hemisphere where distribution previously
	was constrained by latitude. In contrast, northern Africa is not affected
	because the distribution concurs with the Sahelian region, where the absence
	of rainfall and high temperatures limits the disease (similarly with Botswana).
	Conversely, in certain areas of southern Africa, especially South Africa,
	low temperatures previously were limiting-thus, a significant increase
	in distribution is likely. </p>

<p>As this information on sectoral vulnerabilities and integrated assessment of
  potential climate change impacts is developed, it must penetrate more fully
  into national government organizations and international donor agencies. This
  penetration is necessary to ensure that what is known about past and present
  climate variability is properly taken into account in developing national economic
  and environmental plans (Sadowski et al., 1996). Such sensitization of the policymaking
  process to climate variability also ensures that as knowledge about future climate
  change improves, it too can be sensibly used to guide drought/climate-related
  economic policy (OECD, 1996). </p>
<p>Within Africa, priority areas for environmental policy include securing sustainable
  water supply and quality; preventing and reversing desertification; combating
  coastal erosion and pollution; ensuring sustainable industrial development;
  making efficient use of energy resources; maintaining forests and wildlife resources;
  managing demographic change; and ensuring adequate food security. These priority
  areas highlight environmental and developmental concerns in the region that
  require immediate attention from the research and policy communities (Hulme,
  1996a). </p>
