<p>The natural effects of drought may be exacerbated by climate change in catchments
  like the Murray-Darling basin in southeastern Australia, with its present high
  human demands on water. Billabongs (cutoff meanders), which are water bodies
  of high diversity (Boon et al., 1990; Hillman and Shiel, 1991), and off-channel
  wetlands may dry up for extensive periods and become depleted in terms of diversity.
  There is evidence that where species are eliminated by drought, recolonization
  may be slow (e.g., Boulton and Lake, 1992). The already increasing salinity
  of the Murray-Darling system (Macumber, 1990) could alter under a changed climate.
  Although much of the biota of its floodplain sections appears to have considerable
  salinity tolerance (Walker, 1992), above a salinity of 1 g/l many species of
  freshwater biota, especially invertebrates, are adversely affected (Hart et
  al., 1991). In lowland streams of northern Victoria, saline pools that develop
  under normal low-flow conditions (McGuckin et al., 1991) are increasing in number
  and are marked by a very low faunal diversity (Metzeling et al., 1995). </p>
<p>In relation to its size, southWestern Australia has highly endemic fish and
  invertebrate fauna but low species richness (Bunn and Davies, 1990). The low
  diversity may be due to the isolation of the area, its history of aridity, and
  a very low level of primary productivity. If changes in climate were to eliminate
  species in this area, it is unlikely that they would be replaced by species
  colonizing from elsewhere. </p>
<p>Although a great deal is known about New Zealand's aquatic ecosystems, little
  research has been done on the potential impacts of climate change. A number
  of issues and possible impacts-such as the effects of rising sea level on estuaries
  and temperature effects on spawning-have been identified and discussed in preliminary
  reviews by Burns and Roper (1990), Glova (1990), Paul (1990), and McDowell (1992).
  McDowell concluded that scientific knowledge of the controls on New Zealand
  freshwater communities' species composition and interactions and of ecosystem
  function is very limited, and is inadequate to make specific predictions even
  if very detailed climate scenarios were available. </p>
<p>It is known, however, that New Zealand's lake ecosystems are very similar in
  composition and function despite the latitudinal range of 5°C in mean temperature,
  which suggests an insensitivity of these ecosystems to projected temperature
  rises. Furthermore, New Zealand's river ecosystems contain relatively simple
  generalist species with little diversity-presumably a response to the high degree
  of short-term hydrological variability of the country's short, steep rivers
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.6.3.4). Thus, these river ecosystems have an existing
  resilience to hydrological variability, which may offer some degree of insensitivity
  to predicted increases in rainfall variability. </p>
<p>Specific effects on aquatic ecosystems cannot be predicted with confidence.
  A general rule appears to be that the drier the climate, the greater the sensitivity
  to climate change (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 10)-which implies that sensitivities
  and impacts are likely to be more significant in Australia than in New Zealand.
  Any increase in climatic variability, especially in extremes of flooding and
  drought, would have greater ecological effects than a change in mean conditions
  (IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 10.5, 10.6). </p>
<p>The region's marine environment extends from tropical to subantarctic waters
  and includes extensive areas of open ocean. Any changes in the structure and
  strength of the region's wind fields and ocean currents would alter nutrient
  upwelling, food networks, reproductive patterns, and species distribution (IPCC
  1996, WG II, Section 16.2.2). In addition, the Australasian region can expect
  to be affected by major oceanic changes occurring in other regions because the
  waters of the globe's oceans circulate throughout all the major ocean basins.
  Changes in wind speed and direction over upwind land surfaces would alter wind-borne
  terrestrial nutrient input, including micronutrients such as iron. Paleo-oceanographic
  research on sediments east of New Zealand has shown a close relationship between
  ocean phytoplankton productivity-as represented by diatom content-and regional
  wind strength, as represented by terrestrial quartz content (Fenner et al.,
  1992). </p>
<p>As with freshwater systems, our knowledge of the role of climate in marine
  systems and our ability to predict climate change outcomes for the marine environment
  is very limited, though some of the responses of species and ecosystems to climate
  change described above for terrestrial systems are expected to apply to marine
  systems as well. Migration is an option for fish populations where coasts have
  a generally north-south alignment and suitable habitats exist. However, along
  the northern and southern extremities of Australia and New Zealand, or where
  a population is in equilibrium with a specialized habitat such as an estuary,
  rocky reef, island, or submarine seamount, there may be more random losses and
  gains of faunal components. (Impacts on coastal systems are discussed further
  in <a href="081.htm">Section 4.3.4.</a>) </p>
