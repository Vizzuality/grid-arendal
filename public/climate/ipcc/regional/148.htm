<h1>6.4. Integrated Analysis of Potential Impacts and Adaptation Options </h1>
<p>To fulfill the commitments arising from the UNFCCC, Conference of the Parties
  (COP) members in Latin America have initiated the preparation of national GHG
  inventories, with the assistance of the USCSP and the GEF. These inventories
  generally are associated with the performance of vulnerability studies aimed
  at defining the potential impacts of climate change on natural and human systems
  on which the economies and the well-being of the respective national communities
  rely. The resulting information is designed to assist Latin American governments
  in better understanding the urgency of developing more and better information
  on impacts and adaptation strategies; as a tool for minimizing negative impacts
  and taking the best possible advantage of new opportunities under changing climatic
  conditions; and for achieving sustainable development practices. Vulnerability
  and impact assessments and adaptation options should consider interactions and
  feedbacks among different sectors. Some of the outputs of country studies are
  reports of vulnerability to climate change in selected areas in different countries.
  Examples are the case study for Belize (reported in <a href="142.htm#box6-4">Box
  6-4</a>); other case studies cited in the bibliography, such as country studies
  in Venezuela (Perdomo et al., 1996) and Peru (Teves et al., 1996); and information
  included in the preliminary report of the National GHG Inventory in Mexico (Gay-Garcï¿½a
  et al., 1996). Another interesting approach, which may be considered as an integrated
  analysis study with implications for some adaptation options, is summarized
  in <a href="#box6-5">Box 6-5</a>. <br>

      <p>Considering that, under changing climate conditions, land use is a key
	factor for agricultural production as well as for environmental preservation,
	effective land-use regulations would be necessary to reduce the vulnerability
	of this type of human system to climate change. In this connection, an
	analysis of trade-offs among productivity, stability, and sustainability
	in low-output agricultural systems was undertaken by Viglizzo and Roberto
	(1997). It showed that the productivity of herbage and grain (primary
	products) clearly exceeds that of milk and beef (secondary products).
	However, the secondary activities involve processes that are less affected
	by environmental disturbances, whereas primary product processes are more
	extractive in terms of soil nutrients and, consequently, less sustainable
	in the long term. This analysis suggests that different combinations of
	cropping and cattle activities on agricultural lands may need to be regulated
	to prevent undesirable effects in regions with different vulnerability
	to climate change, like Argentina's Pampas.</p>

  Climate change under 2xCO<sub>2</sub> scenarios is projected to produce economic losses
  of 0.9-3.1% of Latin America's GDP. These large losses-compared with global
  (1.1-1.8%) and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
  (1.3-1.9%) loss projections-are explained by the fact that primary production
  accounts for a higher share of GDP in Latin America (Fankhauser and Tol, 1997);
  therefore, a large output is directly exposed to climatic influences (IPCC 1996,
  WG III, Section 6.5.9). It should be noted, however, that many assumptions underlie
  these best guesses-and that large uncertainties remain. </p>
<p>Many of the impacts of climate change may not be directly revealed in the marketplace.
  Nonmarket impacts on biodiversity, subsistence agriculture, traditional land-use
  patterns, and so forth may be no less important than market impacts (IPCC 1996,
  WG III, Table 6-1 and Section 6.2.1). In addition, the impact of climate change
  on Latin American ecosystems needs to be considered in parallel with impacts
  caused by unsustainable land-management practices and the effects of increasing
  population. In most cases, it is impossible to separate the effects of these
  impacts, and land-use impacts and population growth are expected to result in
  more severe changes than are changes in climate. Desertification, for example,
  is a widespread problem in Latin America arising from human abuse of the land
  and adverse climate conditions. Even if wetter conditions were to prevail, human-induced
  desertification could increase the vulnerability of land to desertification
  and escalate the desertification process (see <a href="135.htm">Section 6.3.1.3</a>).
</p>
<p>In most managed ecosystems and human systems, adaptation to climate change
  in Latin America is not as much an issue of scientific knowledge or technical
  feasibility as of socioeconomic and cultural factors and political decisions.
  It is extremely difficult at this stage to analyze the viability of different
  options because their cost/benefit ratio depends on ecological and social conditions
  and the integration of local and external markets. In virtually all cases, political
  measures (e.g., credits, subsidies); educational programs; and interactive communication
  among experts, policymakers, and stakeholders are needed-especially within local
  communities-to implement viable adaptation options. <a href="149.htm">Table
  6-9</a> presents a very preliminary summary of possible adaptation options for
  different sectors within Latin America. </p>
