<h1>6.3. Sensitivity, Adaptability, and Vulnerability </h1>
<p>As noted above, climate change is only one of the causes leading to global
  change. As happens when there are multiple stresses, different stresses may
  be prevalent in different situations. In this regard, the vulnerability of certain
  systems and activities-such as mountain regions with snow/ice cover, low coastal
  areas, agriculture, water resources management and hydropower generation, and
  human health-are recognized as vulnerable under projected climate change scenarios.
  Furthermore, climate change may worsen some existing problems-such as desertification
  and freshwater shortages (in certain regions)-and give rise to new problems,
  such as the expansion of the geographical and altitudinal range of some human
  diseases. Warming of the atmosphere also may result in some benefits, such as
  the enhancement of high-latitude agriculture and reductions in the effects of
  wintertime diseases. Politicians and decisionmakers need to be aware of the
  vulnerability and adaptability of ecosystems and activities in their countries
  and their region, as well as elsewhere around the world, to design and implement
  sustainable development initiatives that take advantage of beneficial climate
  changes and to build strategies for international commercial exchanges in light
  of differential climate change impacts around the world. </p>
<p>Regarding the assessment of climate change impacts on different economic sectors,
  climatic projections at scales relevant to the production and management fields
  are still inadequate (as indicated in <a href="306.htm">Annex
  B</a>). The resolution
  of current GCMs is too coarse to allow reliable projections or cost/benefit
  analyses of possible adaptation options for the individual countries of Latin
  America. In some cases, however, appropriate downscaling and other techniques
  are available, making possible the use of GCM outputs, and regional models suitable
  for impact and vulnerability analysis are now being developed for this region.
</p>
<p>The largest impacts of climate change are likely to affect natural ecosystems
  and sectors related to primary production, such as agriculture, livestock raising,
  and fisheries. Water resources are at risk in many areas. Human health and human
  settlements, especially in coastal lowlands and environmentally and socioeconomically
  marginal areas, also are vulnerable. Impacts are expected to be less severe
  for industry, transportation, and infrastructure outside of flood-prone areas,
  although increased frequency or severity of extreme events may affect these
  sectors. </p>
<h4>6.3.1. Terrestrial Ecosystems: Vulnerability and Impacts<a name="terrestrial"></a>
</h4>
<p>Virtually all of the world's major types of ecosystems are present in Latin
  America (<a href="#figure6-4">Figure 6-4</a>), which is characterized by high
  species and ecosystem diversity. Some Latin American countries-such as Mexico,
  Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru-are among the world's
  richest in terms of terrestrial plant and animal species (<a href="325.htm">Annex D</a>; see also WRI, 1990-91; LAC CDE, 1992). Forest biomes in this region include
  tropical rainforests, such as the Amazon; other tropical forests in eastern
  Mexico, Central America, and northern South America; and the endangered Mata
  Atlantica in Brazil. There also are important sectors of tropical deciduous
  forests in the Yucatán; in the Pacific watershed of Central America, Venezuela,
  and Ecuador; and on the Brazilian coast from about 7°S to the Tropic of Capricorn.
  Mid-latitude deciduous or temperate forests are established on low-elevation
  coastal mountains in southern Brazil and southern Chile and to a lesser extent
  in southern Argentina (in the piedmont area of the Patagonian Andes). Austral
  forests are located on the southernmost tip of the subcontinent and on Tierra
  del Fuego Island. Grasslands, shrublands, and deserts-the most extensive ecosystems
  in the region-are found on the Mexican Pacific and Venezuelan Caribbean coasts,
  in northeastern Brazil, and in inland areas between Brazil and Bolivia. The
  Gran Chaco ecosystem is located across parts of Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina.
  The chaparral biome is on the central Chilean coast. Mid-latitude grasslands
  occupy extensive areas in southern Brazil, Uruguay, and central and eastern
  Argentina; tropical grasslands and savannas are present in Central America,
  the Guyanas, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. Arid shrublands
  occupy the west of Argentina and Patagonia, and hyper-arid areas exist along
  the west coast of Peru and northern Chile, as well as in southern Bolivia and
  northWestern Argentina. The Latin American region includes almost 23% of the
  world's potentially arable land, 12% of the current cropland, and 17% of all
  pastures (Gómez and Gallopin, 1991). <a href="#table6-3">Table 6-3</a> lists
  the surface area of different biomes in South America, and <a href="131.htm#table6-4">Table
  6-4</a> lists land-cover types by country; <a href="#figure6-4">Figure 6-4</a>
  provides information on the actual vegetation cover in South America, based
  on satellite imagery (Stone et al., 1994). <br>
