<h4>9.2.2.2. Tropical Cyclones </h4>
<p>The annual number of tropical cyclones for the greater Caribbean over the last
  100 years and for the southWest Pacific cyclone belt for the past 50 years is
  given in <a href="244.htm#figure9-2">Figure 9-2c,f</a>. In both regions, high
  interannual and subdecadal variations are evident with no long-term overall
  trend. </p>
<h4>9.2.3. Model Projections<a name="model"></a> </h4>
<h4>9.2.3.1. Temperature, Precipitation, and Evaporation<a name="temp"></a> </h4>
<p>Analysis of climate model results (including results from a number of global
  coupled atmosphere-ocean models) suggests that global mean surface air temperatures
  can be expected to rise in the future. Unfortunately, current computing requirements
  for atmosphere-ocean GCMs (AOGCMs) virtually prohibit the modeling community
  from conducting simulations at fine horizontal resolution; because many of the
  small island states fall within a grid box of the models, they are not appropriately
  resolved. This constraint severely limits any ability to generate future projections
  of climate change for small islands. Nonetheless, because the climate of these
  islands is influenced by the surrounding oceans, and the oceans are expected
  to warm in the future (albeit at a slower rate than land masses), the small
  island states also are likely to experience moderate warming. Pittock et al.
  (1995) have made some progress toward developing climate change scenarios for
  the southWest Pacific. </p>
<p>An annual mean rise in tropical sea-surface temperature of about 1.0°C is projected
  by AOGCMs (with a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>), with no appreciable differences between
  the two seasons. This projection is in agreement with the analysis of Wigley
  and Santer (1993)-who were confident that, although the magnitude of the warming
  in the Caribbean is uncertain, the sign of the projection is correct. The models
  also suggest some differential mean warming of the eastern and western Pacific
  Ocean. Small reductions also are projected in mean diurnal temperature ranges.
</p>
<p>One possible consequence of generally warmer temperatures would be an increase
  in evaporation in the tropics. As in other regions, however, the rates of increase
  in evaporation in the latitudes of small island states would not be uniform
  because evaporation is influenced by factors other than temperature (e.g., pressure).
  Thus, changes in evaporation rates would be expected to vary spatially and temporally,
  across and within regions. </p>
<p>Mean rainfall intensity is projected to increase by approximately 20-30% over
  the tropical oceans (the main locations of the small island states) at the time
  of doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>. However, simulation experiments with combined GHG and aerosol
  forcings suggest that mean precipitation might decrease during summer over the
  Mediterranean Sea region, leading to a higher probability of dry soils in islands
  located in this region (i.e., Cyprus and Malta). Relatively greater increases
  in mean rainfall are projected for the central equatorial Pacific Ocean region
  (see IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 6.2). </p>
<p>Inter-model agreement (for equilibrium experiments, as well as for coupled
  model experiments) on rainfall change is variable. Agreement is poor for the
  western tropical Atlantic Ocean/Caribbean Sea and Mediterranean Sea regions;
  it is moderate for the Indian Ocean and fairly good over the Pacific Ocean region
  (see Maul, 1993; Whetton et al., 1996).</p>
