<h4>4.7.2.5. Conservation Tillage </h4>
<p>Conventional tillage generally leads to a gradual reduction in carbon stocks,
  whereas conservation tillage (including increased crop residue return) on areas
  formerly under conventional tillage generally results in a slow recovery of
  soil carbon towards the original, untilled level (Fact Sheet 4.3). Spatial variability
  is high because tillage is patchily applied in time and space by a large number
  of individual farmers, each working on a small area. The cost per sample is
  low to moderate, but a large number of samples are needed. Leakage is low because
  crop yields are similar to those achieved with conventional tillage, and the
  activity is clearly human-induced. The carbon gained is easily lost again if
  the land use reverts to conventional tillage even briefly (Lindstrom <i>et al.</i>,
  1999). There generally is a reduction in fossil fuel usage (through less machinery
  use), and there may be minor increases in CH<span class="subscript">4</span> uptake and N<span class="subscript">2</span>O emission by the
  soil. </p>
<p>The net increased emission of GHGs resulting from conventional tillage (excluding
  emissions resulting from the initial land-use conversion) is small on a per-hectare
  basis, as is the net uptake resulting from conservation tillage. The total global
  area to which these practices could be applied is very large, however. The associated
  environmental impacts of conventional tillage (erosion, declining soil native
  fertility, loss of biodiversity) are generally negative, and the associated
  impacts of conservation tillage are therefore positive relative to conventional
  tillage; on the negative side is possibly increased use of biocides and an increase
  in soil water-which in some cases may increase drainage that can affect salinization
  in downslope soils. </p>
<p>The socioeconomic benefits of tillage are large, of course (it is the basis
  of global food and fiber production), and can be maintained under conservation
  tillage. Conservation tillage currently is not more widely applied largely because
  the economic benefits are marginal (and may even be marginally negative), and
  the added organic material at the surface may create some additional disease
  problems in some situations. At a project or national level, the decision to
  use conservation tillage as a climate change reducing activity would probably
  be strongly influenced by the balance of reporting costs relative to carbon
  stored. </p>
