<h3>5.6.1. Consistency with Nationally Defined Sustainable Development and/or
  National Development Goals</h3>
<p>Prospective investors in LULUCF projects and host countries may have different
  priorities in selecting projects. From the investors' perspective, criteria
  such as land availability and the suitability of the country to undertake the
  project, the estimated GHG benefits, project cost-effectiveness, risk, and other
  environmental effects are some of the major concerns. From the host country's
  perspective, projects that more specifically consider regional or local land-use
  priorities and significantly strengthen sustainable development contributions
  will be favored. Some observers have also expressed concern that selecting only
  the cheapest projects will be detrimental to non-Annex I countries if they subsequently
  take on GHG emissions (Lee <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Brown, 1998). For LULUCF projects
  to be designed, conceived, and implemented successfully to provide economic
  and environmental benefits, however, the support of different stakeholders of
  the project-project investors, host countries, and local communities-is crucial.
</p>
<p>The voluntary nature of host country participation in climate mitigation projects
  increases the prospects that only projects that satisfy investor and host country
  interests will be implemented. Moreover, host countries can take steps to ensure
  that the goals of accepted projects are consistent with national and local development
  and natural resource protection priorities (Intarapravich, 1995; Michaelowa
  and Schmidt, 1997; Hardner <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Dutch and Costa Rican criteria
  for approval of AIJ projects, for example, state that projects should be compatible
  with and supportive of sustainable development priorities of each country; fulfill
  the obligations of various conventions; and enhance income opportunities and
  quality of life for rural people and members of certain vulnerable groups, including
  cultural minorities (Andrasko <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Ministry of Housing, Spatial
  Planning and the Environment, 1996; Subak, 2000). </p>
<p>One way to ensure that a mitigation project is consistent with the host country's
  developmental goals is for the host country to set up a simple approval process
  for accepting projects and to list criteria that are based on national and local
  needs. Projects may not satisfy all criteria, but it is important to ensure
  that they adhere to all applicable laws and/or regulations of the host country.
  To meet national or regional sustainable development priorities, project transaction
  costs should be kept low. High costs can reduce investor interest in financing
  LULUCF climate mitigation projects (<a href="251.htm">Section 5.2</a>) and reduce
  the proportion of funding available to promote and monitor environmental and
  social aspects of implemented projects. </p>
<p>To achieve consistency with national and regional environmental and development
  goals, it is also important to ensure that policies and programs support rather
  than undermine project objectives. Changes in key policies that may affect project
  sustainability either positively or negatively include financial subsidies for
  forestry or agriculture, land tenure, policies to expand agricultural production,
  import-export policies, and paper recycling programs (World Bank, 1997). For
  example, Brazil's government-subsidized program to produce ethanol vehicle fuel
  from sugarcane withered in the face of low gasoline prices (La Rovere, 1998).
  Therefore, incorporating projects that minimize conflicts or institutional changes
  relative to existing land-use policies in the host country may be essential.
