<h3>4.3.2. How Broadly or Narrowly are "Activities" Defined? </h3>
<p>In this context, the term "broad" is used to denote an activity definition
  that is essentially land- or area-based, where the net effect of all practices
  that might be applied to the same area over the same time period are included
  within the activity. For example, the broad activity of "cropland management"
  might embrace practices such as conservation tillage, improved fertilization,
  and irrigation water management. If broad definitions are applied, periodic
  stock change measurements that statistically sample the area to be monitored
  could be used to estimate the net effect of altered carbon emission or sink
  processes. Where statistical sampling methods are used, monitoring larger areas
  becomes more cost-effective because the number of samples required for a given
  degree of statistical accuracy does not scale up proportionately with increased
  area. <br>
  The term "narrow" denotes an activity definition that is based on individual
  practices, such as reduced tillage or irrigation water management. Where individual
  practices are used as the basis for reporting, associated rates of reduced emissions
  or increased sinks need to be developed through model estimates or research
  plots-which in many instances are not yet available for all environmental circumstances.
  Estimates of annual rates of carbon stock change could then be estimated as
  a product of the area affected by the practice and the associated rate of emission
  or sink (perhaps by general soil type, if needed for accuracy). Such estimates
  could be verified by using other data sources or by a sampling technique that
  measured soil carbon stock change on the area where the practice had been reported.
  Non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> GHG emission estimates could be included where appropriate (on agricultural
  soils, these emissions may already be reported under the IPCC Guidelines, so
  care may need to be taken to avoid double-counting). </p>
<p>Some implications regarding definition of activities follow: </p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Broad
    <ul>
      <li>Activity definitions can be fairly loose.</li>
      <li>Lends itself to land-based stock change CO<span class="subscript">2</span> flux measurements; helps
	minimize double-counting or undercounting.</li>
      <li>Non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> GHG fluxes must be estimated with practice-based models or other
	methods.</li>
      <li>Verifiable by a third party, using different methods and at a later
	date, using techniques such as statistical sampling or remote sensing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Narrow
    <ul>
      <li>Activity definitions critical; must be unambiguous, implementable, and
	verifiable.</li>
      <li>Lends itself to activity-based model estimates of fluxes. Where multiple
	activities occur on the same land area, there is a potential for double-counting.</li>
      <li>CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions can be estimated with activity-based models.
	Where more than one activity occurs on a land area, some of which are
	not included in Article 3.4 accounting, stock change measures would be
	more difficult.</li>
      <li>Verifiable by auditing activity statistics and independently checking
	them using other data sources. Verifying where activities have occurred
	in prior years may be difficult or impossible if no visible evidence remains.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Both options would require further decisions about the modalities, rules, and
  guidelines necessary for implementation. Some options are discussed in <a href="211.htm">Section
  4.6</a> and in <a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a>. </p>
<p>The process of selecting activities would be facilitated and made more transparent
  and consistent by the development of criteria for activity selection (<a href="218.htm">Section
  4.7</a>). </p>
<p>One approach to structuring activities broadly is suggested by <a href="#figure4-6">Figure
  4-6</a>, which indicates how broadly defined activities might be fitted into
  a land-cover classification system. If such a scheme were used, every activity,
  no matter how it were defined, would fit in one of the boxes in the matrix.
  A national inventory based on a sampling scheme that produced statistically
  reliable estimates for each land cover/land use box in the matrix could produce
  national estimates of carbon stock change across all land uses and land cover
  areas. Therefore, if Parties differed somewhat over the definition of an activity,
  the practices carried out within the activity, or a definition of land cover
  such as forest, the impact on total accounting would be minimal because the
  impact would simply shift from one box in the matrix to another. If such an
  approach were adopted, a full-carbon accounting system (<a href="038.htm">Chapter
  2</a>) would be required, wherein each major land area and land use were sampled
  on a periodic basis. Such a system is in place in some countries (national forest
  inventories are one example) but may currently be infeasible for some. </p>

<p>The activities reviewed in <a href="171.htm">Section 4.4</a> are categorized
  in a way that is consistent with this broadly defined approach-not to prejudge
  the decisions to be taken by the Conference of Parties (COP) but to keep the
  presentation to a reasonable length. For more specific information on a few
  of the practices that might be considered as additional activities under the
  narrow-definition approach, see the Fact Sheets at the end of the chapter. </p>
