<h3>2.2.6. Ecologic-Economic Zoning and Globally Consistent Databases on Land
  Resources</h3>
<p>The quantification of Articles 3.3 and 3.4 activities for accounting purposes
  will likely be undertaken by country institutions. There may be vast differences
  in carbon sequestration potential, however, within a Party's territory depending
  on prevailing socioeconomic conditions, legal-institutional structure, and bio-geophysical
  conditions. Identification and delineation of these variations will simplify
  national level reporting and reduce measurement sample requirements (<a href="077.htm">Section
  2.4</a>). Such a classification system may also serve as a geographic base for
  land-based accounting (<a href="061.htm#s2-3-2-2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>). </p>
<p>The socioeconomic conditions of rural areas are normally expressed in statistical
  data for each administrative unit (e.g., districts or provinces). Legal-administrative
  characteristics (e.g., land ownership type, national parks, indigenous reserves)
  are generally defined within historically defined geographical units. Bio-geophysical
  conditions within a country can be homogeneous or very diverse, depending on
  the country's size and variation in climatic zones. </p>
<p>The sequestration potential and the percentage of each biophysical zone within
  a country are important variables. One approach is to apply biome or eco-region
  concepts, with geographic domains (e.g., polar, humid temperate, dry, humid
  tropical), divisions (e.g., tundra, boreal forests, prairies, steppe, deserts,
  savannas, and rainforests), and subdivisions based on elevation. Bailey (1998)
  and Udvardy (1975) provide world maps that are based on these units; they are
  also defined in the "life-zones" scheme of Holdridge (1947), which is used in
  many Latin American countries for national zonations. </p>
<p>For Article 3.4 activities that involve agricultural soils, the agro-ecological
  zone (AEZ) concept developed by FAO (1996) may be used for within-country geographic
  subdivisions. This concept combines agroclimatic characteristics with elevation/
  topography and soil conditions. Agroclimatic criteria include major climates
  (boreal, arid, seasonally dry subtropics, humid tropics, etc.), annual growing
  periods, a dryness index, and the frost period. Initially applied only to developing
  countries, the AEZ program has been recently extended to all Annex I countries
  and made available in digital form, accompanied by a digital elevation model
  and a soil database that includes soil carbon (FAO/IIASA, 1999; Fischer et al.,
  1999). The combination of the three data sets provides the spatially explicit
  AEZs. In a simplified form these zones can be used to construct tables of carbon
  sequestration potential per country (see <a href="157.htm">Chapter 4</a>). </p>
<p>A global database on forest cover and changes in forest cover since 1980 is
  available through FAO's decadal Forest Assessments, the latest being FRA 2000
  (FAO, 1993a; FAO, 1997b; UN-ECE/FAO, 2000). FAO also maintains a global and
  country-level database on agricultural land use and commodity movements. The
  FAO/Unesco world soils information (FAO, 1971-1981), although somewhat out of
  date, is based on correlation of national soil mapping information. Upgrades
  of the soil database per continent currently underway (SOTER program) (FAO,
  1993b; Baumgardner, 1999) will provide spatial terrain data with associated
  soil profile measurements, climatic conditions, and vegetation or land-use information
  in relational digital form, based on country-wide geographic information at
  a medium intensity (scale 1:1 million). The Latin American-Caribbean component
  was completed in 1998 (FAO/UNEP/ISRIC, 1999); the other continents will be covered
  in the coming 3 to 6 years, with Africa as a priority region. Technical soil
  data are provided in terms of the World Reference Base for Soil Classification
  (WRB, 1998) and Soil Taxonomy (SSS, 1999), where appropriate. These databases
  can be used to compile country-wide maps on actual and potential soil carbon
  stock. For some regions, such as North America (Lacelle et al., 1997), generalized
  soil carbon maps are already available. </p>
<p>In general, national and international geo-referenced databases on the 1990
  state of forests and qualitative vegetative cover, soil and terrain conditions,
  actual land uses, and degree of soil degradation and improvement are approximate
  only. </p>
