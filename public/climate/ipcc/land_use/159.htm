<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (continued) </h2>
<p>Carbon storage rates per hectare in grazing systems are low, but these systems
  cover very large areas. Net carbon uptake can be achieved through reversion
  of degrading processes (overgrazing, erosion, acidification and salinization)-a
  strategy that also tends to increase productivity. Increased carbon storage
  can also occur through enhanced plant productivity by fertilization of nutrient-limited
  locations, introduction of better adapted grass and legume species, and irrigation
  in water-limited situations. Changes in grazing and fire management can also
  increase soil and biomass carbon pools. The increases in woody biomass that
  usually follow a reduction in fire frequency may have adverse impacts on grazing
  productivity, other production values, and biodiversity. Monitoring the extensive
  but relatively small per-unit area changes in grassland carbon stocks is technically
  challenging. The net assessment must include changes in CH<span class="subscript">4</span>,
  N<span class="subscript">2</span>O, and ozone-precursor emissions (<a href="177.htm">Section
  4.4.3</a>). </p>
<p>Drainage of wetlands can reduce methane emissions, but it results in a rapid
  emission of carbon dioxide. Re-flooding of previously drained wetlands allows
  carbon to be stored, but only at a slow rate-which can result in domination
  of the radiative forcing benefit by the restored methane emission. These offsetting
  impacts make full and symmetrical accounting of wetland management a difficult
  and complex problem (<a href="196.htm">Sections 4.4.6</a>, <a href="219.htm">4.7.2</a>).
</p>
<p>The chapter identifies several activities that can occur under different land
  use and cover conditions. These activities therefore are difficult to separate
  out under most land-cover mapping schemes (<a href="167.htm">Section 4.3.2</a>)
  that separate the landscape into areas of cropland, grassland, forest, and so
  forth. These activities include agroforestry and biofuel production-which are
  options for growing a different mix of crops on crop, grass, or forest land-and
  restoration of severely degraded soils. </p>
<p>The use of agricultural and forest crops to produce biofuels reduces the use
  of fossil fuels-currently by the equivalent of about 1 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>
  and potentially by up to 10 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>. If biomass crops were deployed
  at this maximum level, they would be a major land use. The fossil fuel replacement
  effect is captured under existing reporting rules, but the direct effects of
  land conversion to biofuel crops (which can be positive or negative) are not.
  The latter could be included under Article 3.3 (where forest crops were planted
  on former cropland) and/or under Article 3.4 (where growing grasses or short-rotation
  woody crops for biofuels were defined as a cropping change). Modern biofuel
  technology could contribute to sustainable development and GHG mitigation and
  may reduce GHG levels sooner than other energy sector measures, at low cost.
</p>
<p>Agroforestry can increase carbon sequestration while creating positive environmental
  and social impacts such as improved biodiversity and farm income security. It
  includes conversion of land recently derived from forest to agroforests rather
  than to croplands or pastures, restoration of nutrient-depleted lands using
  trees, and improvement of productivity in current agroforestry systems in tropical
  and temperate regions. At present, the application of agroforestry is largely
  limited to non-Annex I countries. </p>
<p>Restoration of severely degraded soils can produce significant increases in
  soil and biomass carbon per unit area. In general, restoration activities also
  improve biodiversity, promote sustainable productivity, and reduce air and water
  pollution. Their adoption will often require some form of additional incentives
  because the immediate benefits to land managers can be negligible or negative.
  If relapse is avoided by addressing the causes of the original degradation,
  the carbon pools formed are effectively permanent. Reclamation, restoration,
  and removal of the causes of severe land degradation are almost always expensive,
  so no more than a few percent of the affected area can or will realize this
  potential. Fully reclaimed land can be put to a variety of uses and offers the
  opportunity to adopt many of the sequestration methods discussed in this Special
  Report for increasing the carbon sink still further. </p>
<p>To facilitate the assessment of existing proposals and future proposals as
  they arise, we have suggested a decision framework that can be adapted to assist
  in the consideration of issues such as verifiability, additionality, permanence,
  and additional impacts (see <a href="#table4-2">Table 4-2</a>). </p>
