<h3>3.2.1. Definitional Scenarios </h3>
<p>From the definitions presented in <a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a>, we assembled 
  seven illustrative scenarios that reflect a range of possible approaches to 
  implement Article 3.3 (see <a href="#table3-4">Table 3-4</a>). This approach 
  was selected to highlight the complexity of combining definition elements and 
  the possible implications of these combinations. These seven scenarios are not 
  intended to be exhaustive of all possible scenarios. We selected two scenarios 
  that use definitions found in FAO publications and the IPCC Guidelines. These 
  two scenarios are intended to capture the existing frameworks in which Article 
  3.3 could be viewed.</p>

          of forest..."-an action that may be interpreted as a direct human activity. 
        </li>
        <li> Planting of trees always qualifies as afforestation or reforestation, 
          yet the site need not be deforested prior to being reforested. </li>
        <li> Silvicultural planting following a harvest would qualify as reforestation, 
          but the harvest would usually not count as deforestation (i.e., symmetry 
          between deforestation and reforestation is not maintained). </li>

          with specific activity requirements (e.g., planting versus regeneration 
          through silvicultural activities).</li>
        <li>No ambiguity in definition of deforestation, reforestation, or afforestation 
          in that each involves direct human-induced activity.</li>

        <li>Based on a very simple structure and approach that would leave many 
          decisions to national administrations. </li>

      </ul>
    </td>

      <ul>
        <li>Would lead to most intensive forest harvesting being considered as 
          deforestation, and most forest regeneration being considered as reforestation 
          (creates large area of ARD lands).</li>
        <li>Most forest management activities would create ARD lands. </li>
        <li>Definitions of reforestation and afforestation use the phrase "Activities 
          that lead to..." so that credit can be given for increase in carbon 
          stocks associated with reforestation and afforestation prior to reaching 
          the Y% cover threshold required to define an area of land as forest.</li>

          maximum flexibility in establishing its own criteria because it can 
          convert cover or inventory data to a carbon per unit area basis. Countries 
          may select threshold for crown cover, carbon, tree height, etc. Also, 
          countries may select how long a land must have been non-forest to qualify

          large areas being considered ARD lands.</li>
        <li>Selection of cover classes is based on thresholds in widest usage.</li>
        <li>nclusion of regenerating forest within definition of a forest means 
          forest management will not result in creation of ARD lands unless there

<p>A key difference between the FAO and most of the other scenarios is that the 
  FAO definition of reforestation includes artificial regeneration of tree cover 
  after a clearing. The State of the World's Forests 1999 report (FAO, 1999) defines 
  reforestation as "establishment of a tree crop on forest land." The Forest Resource 
  Assessment Terms and Definitions (FAO, 1998) define reforestation as "artificial 
  establishment of forest on lands which carried forest before" but gives this 
  definition under the headings "forest cover changes" and "new plantations." 
  TBFRA 2000 (UN, 1999, p. 157) explains regeneration of forest land as "reforestation 
  of land that has recently been forested." Such regeneration includes natural 
  regeneration, natural regeneration enhanced by planting, coppice sprouting, 
  and planting or seeding. We interpret the FAO definition of reforestation to 
  include regeneration after clearing. </p>
<p>The IPCC scenario is extracted from the Glossary of the IPCC Reporting Guidelines. 
  These guidelines do not include a definition of a forest, however, which limits 
  their direct applicability. For the purposes of the IPCC scenario, we have assumed 
  the FAO definition of forests. Neither FAO nor IPCC designed their definitions 
  of forest, afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation with the Kyoto Protocol 
  in mind; thus, the definitions are not necessarily optimal for meeting the requirements 
  of Article 3.3. </p>
<p>To ensure that a full range of possible definitional approaches was explored, 
  we developed five additional scenarios on the basis of the definitional framework 
  for the terms forest, afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation, as outlined 
  in <a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a>. The Land Use scenario employs a land-use 
  definition of a forest and bases the definitions of afforestation and reforestation 
  on activities undertaken on a piece of land. Three of the scenarios-Land Cover, 
  Flexible, and Biome-use different definitions of a forest but similar definitions 
  of afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation. The differences in carbon 
  amounts associated with differences in the definition of what is and is not 
  a forest are very large, reflecting fundamental differences about how Article 
  3.3 could be implemented and the amount of credits or debits it would create. 
  The Land Cover scenario uses a fixed threshold for what is a forest; the Flexible 
  scenario entails a country-based definition that utilizes carbon or crown-cover 
  criteria; and the Biome scenario uses a biome-based fixed criterion. The remaining 
  definitional scenario, Degradation/Aggradation, attempts to capture in the definitions 
  of deforestation and reforestation the incremental nature of many deforestation 
  and reforestation events. </p>
<p>The differences among these definitional scenarios are summarized in <a href="#table3-5">Table 
  3-5</a>. Note that the definitional scenarios are not intended to be discrete 
  but illustrative. It is possible to combine definitional elements from one scenario 
  with those from another. In combining definitional elements, it is important 
  to recognize that the implications are not always transparent.</p>

<p>The definitional scenarios imply activities and conditions that invoke the 
  creation of ARD lands under Article 3.3, as well as which activities are left 
  for Article 3.4 if double-counting is to be avoided. For example, if ARD and 
  forests are defined broadly to include the harvest/regeneration cycle (e.g., 
  FAO or Land Cover scenarios), few if any forestry activities will be left for 
  inclusion under Article 3.4. The Degradation/Aggradation scenario might also 
  somewhat reduce the choice of activities under Article 3.4, though not as much. 
  With the IPCC, Flexible, Biome, and Land Use scenarios, most forestry activities 
  would fall outside Article 3.3 and thus would be candidates for Article 3.4. 
</p>
<p>In analyzing the implications of the definitional scenarios, the assumption 
  has been made that all activities are DHI unless they have been demonstrated 
  to be otherwise. The remainder of this chapter discusses how the definitional 
  scenarios interact with a wide range of activities and conditions. </p>
