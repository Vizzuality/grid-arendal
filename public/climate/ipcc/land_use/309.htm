<h4>6.3.2.3. Fossil Fuel Substitution </h4>
<p>The Guidelines capture reduced emissions resulting from fossil fuel substitution
  in the energy sector. Biomass fuels include wood, wood waste, charcoal, bio-alcohol,
  biogas, and so forth (IPCC, 1997, Vol. 1, p 1.20). The Guidelines state that
  "Biomass fuels are included in the national energy and carbon dioxide emissions
  accounts for information only. Within the energy module biomass consumption
  is assumed to equal its regrowth. Any departures from this hypothesis are counted
  within the Land Use Change and Forestry module" (IPCC, 1997, Vol. 2, p. 1.3).
  Specifically, under the UNFCCC, the accounting of biomass changes occurs in
  the "changes in forest and other woody biomass stocks" category of the LUCF
  module. Hence, fossil fuel substitution by reduced carbon dioxide emissions
  in the energy sector is already "rewarded." </p>
<p>To avoid underreporting, therefore, any changes in biomass stocks on lands
  under Article 3.4 resulting from the production of biofuels would need to be
  included in the accounts. For non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> greenhouse gases, the situation differs
  because "non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> greenhouse gas emissions from biomass as fuels are included
  in the Energy sector" (IPCC, 1997, Vol. 2, p. 1.15); hence, underreporting is
  not expected to occur. </p>
<h3><a name="s6-3-3"></a>6.3.3. Forest Harvesting and Wood Products </h3>
<p>In the Guidelines, all CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions and removals associated with forest harvesting
  and the oxidation of wood products are accounted for in the year of harvesting
  by the country in which the wood was grown. This approach may be inaccurate
  because of the underlying assumption that there is no change in the size of
  the wood products pool. </p>
<p>To resolve this issue, the IPCC (Brown <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Lim <i>et al.</i>,
  1999a) identified three approaches for estimating emissions and removals of
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> from forest harvesting and wood products. All of these approaches are more
  data intensive than the current Guidelines, and concerns over their practicality
  have been raised (Maclaren, 1999; see also <a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a>).
  Furthermore, if the Guidelines are applied, CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions from forest harvesting
  are already counted; therefore, these emissions should not be counted again.
  If wood products are brought into the inventory under the Protocol, however,
  more accurate methods-such as those described below-may be elaborated. Further
  work, however, cannot be initiated until there is guidance from the Parties
  on which, if any, of the approaches below is adopted. </p>
<p><i>Stock-change approach.</i> This approach estimates net changes in carbon
  stocks in the forest and wood products pool. Changes in carbon stock in forests
  are accounted for in the country in which the wood is grown (the producing country).
  Changes in the products pool are accounted for in the country where the products
  are used (the consuming country). These stock changes are counted within national
  boundaries, where and when they occur. </p>
<p><i>Production approach.</i> This approach also estimates net changes in carbon
  stocks in the forest and wood products pool, but it attributes both to the producing
  country. This approach inventories domestically produced stocks only and does
  not provide a complete inventory of national stocks. Stock changes are counted
  when but not where they occur if wood products are traded. </p>
<p><i>Atmospheric-flow approach.</i> This approach accounts for net emissions
  or removals of carbon to and from the atmosphere within national boundaries,
  where and when the emissions and removals occur. Removals of carbon from the
  atmosphere resulting from forest growth is accounted for in the producing country;
  emissions of carbon to the atmosphere from oxidation of harvested wood products
  are accounted for in the consuming country. </p>
