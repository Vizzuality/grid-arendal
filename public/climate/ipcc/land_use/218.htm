<h2>4.7. Technical Issues Related to Implementation of Article 3.4</h2>
<h3><a name="s4-7-1"></a>4.7.1. Assessing Activities </h3>
<p>If the Parties decide to include only some activities under Article 3.4, they
  will need to address two generic problems: </p>
<ul>
  <li>How to weigh the large number of factors relevant to the decision</li>
  <li>How to be consistent across widely different practices, some of which probably
    have not even been suggested yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>One way to deal with both of these issues is to adopt a decision framework
  that allows practices now and in the future to be screened in a consistent way
  and simplifies a complex problem by dividing it into simpler steps and following
  a logical procedure. The framework outlined in <a href="#figure4-13">Figure
  4-13</a> is one example of such a procedure, which could be modified by the
  Parties. It works through multiple criteria to reach an endpoint where an activity
  falls into one of the following categories: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Clearly a priority candidate for inclusion</li>
  <li>Clearly not a candidate</li>
  <li>May need to be considered in terms of reduced radiative forcing of the atmosphere
    traded off against non-climate impacts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach can be made semi-quantitative up to the point at which climate
  impacts need to be compared to non-climate impacts, which unavoidably involves
  value judgments. The procedure can be applied at all scales (project, national,
  or global), although the importance-weighting of different criteria is likely
  to vary with scale. For example, the cost-efficiency of the activity (especially
  the monitoring cost) is very important at the project level, and non-climate
  impact is very important at the national level. At the global level, the net
  atmospheric impact (discounted for risk and uncertainty) and its verifiability
  may be the key criteria. </p>

	  and how likely it is to be lost through disturbance (note that this
	  is an example list; the Parties have yet to decide which criteria will
	  be employed). The estimate then must be adjusted for changes in non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
	  GHG emissions and changes in fossil fuel consumption resulting from
	  the activity. Finally, this adjusted estimate must be weighted up in
	  relation to the non-climate benefits or disbenefits it may cause.</i></div>

<p>The total global magnitudes for carbon stored through various activities (<a href="160.htm#figure4-1">Table
  4-1</a>) are relevant to the discussion of whether activities should be included
  as adjustments to Kyoto Protocol targets or whether they are so insignificant
  that the additional complexity of accounting is not justified. From the perspective
  of individual nations or projects, the local rate (the per-hectare rate multiplied
  by the area under consideration) may be of highest concern. Even activities
  that make minor global contributions can be important in the GHG inventories
  of individual nations. </p>
<p>Arguments about the cost of implementing an activity or the cost of measurement
  and reporting an activity are not directly relevant to whether an activity should
  be permitted under Article 3.4. Such arguments, however, will strongly affect
  the degree to which permitted activities will actually take place or be reported
  by individual Parties. Most of the additional activities analyzed in this chapter
  are undertaken primarily for non-climate reasons, so only a portion of the cost
  would be allocated to climate impact reduction. For activities whose cost-effectiveness
  is already demonstrated by their partial adoption, the costs of broader application
  may consist only of the marginal transaction cost of inventorying and reporting.
  Individual countries and projects will make cost-effectiveness decisions on
  the basis of their own circumstances, which vary greatly, and in relation to
  the cost of alternative land-use activities and energy sector options. Inventory
  and reporting costs are important at the national level if spatially comprehensive
  (and especially spatially explicit) accounting is required. </p>
<p>The sample assessment procedure begins by estimating the carbon storage rate
  for the activity in a given area (<a href="#figure4-13">Figure 4-13</a>). It
  then successively reduces this value, taking into consideration the following
  factors: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The confidence with which the storage rate can be estimated</li>
  <li>The degree to which the observed storage is likely to result from direct
    human-induced activity</li>
  <li>The security of the carbon pools formed (given the risks to which they are
    exposed).</li>
</ul>
<p>The example deliberately refrains from being prescriptive regarding cutoff
  criteria or formulae to be used because these judgments are decisions for the
  policy process. The weighting factors conceptually range between zero and one:
  In the example, "fully weighted" means a weighting of 1.0, "highly weighted"
  approximately 0.7, "low weighted" approximately 0.4, and "very low weighted"
  approximately 0.2. </p>
