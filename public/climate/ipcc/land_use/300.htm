<h2>6.2. Relevant issues in the IPCC Guidelines for Reporting under the Kyoto
  Protocol</h2>
<p>This section reviews the Guidelines and summarizes issues relevant to Articles
  3.3 and 3.4 of the Protocol. </p>
<h3><a name="s6-2-1"></a>6.2.1. Relevance of the IPCC Guidelines to the Protocol
</h3>
<p>Two linked themes underpin the accounting methods in the LUCF chapters of the
  Guidelines. First, net emissions and removals of atmospheric carbon (as CO<span class="subscript">2</span>)
  by the land are assumed to be equal to changes in biomass carbon and soil carbon
  stocks. Second, annual changes in carbon stocks are calculated from rates of
  change in land use and the human activities that bring about these changes.
  <br>
  The estimated emissions and removals of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> are reported in the following categories
  in the LUCF chapter: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Changes in forest and other woody biomass stocks (e.g., afforestation, reforestation)</li>
  <li>Decay and on- and off-site burning of aboveground biomass from conversion
    of forest and grassland to other land-cover types (e.g., deforestation), together
    with non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> trace gas emissions from on-site burning of biomass</li>
  <li>Regrowth of biomass on abandoned managed lands</li>
  <li>Changes in soil carbon stocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three ARD activities are described in the Guidelines. Deforestation (IPCC,
  1997, Vol. 3, p. 5.6) is referred to as conversion of forest, often accompanied
  by burning. Afforestation is defined as planting of new forests on lands that
  historically have not contained forests (IPCC, 1997, Vol. 1, p.1, Glossary).
  Reforestation is defined as planting of forests on lands that have previously
  contained forests but have been converted to some other use or some other species
  (IPCC, 1997, Vol. 1, Glossary). </p>
<p>Afforestation and reforestation activities are described differently in a footnote
  of the Reference Manual (Vol. 3, p. 5.14), which states that "plantations are
  forest stands that have been established artificially, to produce a forest product
  'crop.' They are either on lands that previously have not supported forests
  for more than 50 years (<i>afforestation</i>), or on lands that previously supported
  forests within the last 50 years and where the original crop has been replaced
  with a different one (<i>reforestation</i>) (Brown <i>et al.</i>, 1986)." </p>
<p>Consistent with the concept of comprehensive accounting, all trees can be potentially
  included in the national inventory. The default biomass data for forests are
  based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), at least for the tropics
  (IPCC, 1997, Vol. 3, p. 5.7). According to the Guidelines, however, percentage
  crown cover can also be used to characterize open and closed forests (IPCC,
  1997, Vol. 3, p. 5.7). The IPCC categories of trees are potentially wide-ranging
  and can be extended to include those that are not traditionally considered "forests,"
  such as village and farm trees (IPCC, 1997, Vol. 3, p. 5.7) and urban trees
  (IPCC, 1997, Vol. 1, p. 1.14). <a href="038.htm">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="112.htm">3</a>
  discuss other definitions of forests and their implications. </p>
<p>Users of the Guidelines are required to select appropriate input data and assumptions
  for the methods chosen. Users must decide on forest definitions, land-use classifications,
  activities, land areas subject to ARD and other activities, accounting methods,
  and the number of carbon pools to be included in the inventory. The Guidelines
  provide definitions and guidance for choosing appropriate definitions, but they
  are not prescriptive. As noted in <a href="038.htm">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="112.htm">3</a>,
  an inventory for LULUCF is sensitive to varying definitions. The amount of land
  that is brought into the inventory, for example, depends critically on the definitions
  applied. The Guidelines allow considerable flexibility in their interpretation
  and do not, in themselves, ensure consistency in reporting among Parties (see
  <a href="302.htm">Section 6.2.3.</a>). <br>
  For Parties that wish to move away from defaults and collect national data,
  the Guidelines offer only a limited range of methods-though this situation is
  not unique to LULUCF. Currently, the Guidelines do not provide a framework for
  reporting the variability and uncertainty of national data; again, this situation
  is not unique to LULUCF. </p>
