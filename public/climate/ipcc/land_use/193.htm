<h4>4.4.5.4. Pest Management </h4>
<p>Pest management is the application of approved strategies to maintain a pest
  population within tolerable levels. Improved pest management may prevent damage
  to standing stocks of forests and thus prolong and increase carbon storage.
  The processes related to carbon storage are well known, whereas the reasons
  pests occur and how they can be prevented are far less well known. The interactions
  between pests, fire, and climate change are likely to be important factors in
  forest cover change in the next century. <br>
  Methodological and scientific uncertainty will make this practice difficult
  to measure and monitor if practice-based accounting is used. As part of a broad
  forest management strategy, good pest management will contribute to improved
  carbon stocks over time by helping to maintain sustainable forest conditions
  and higher standing carbon stocks within managed forests. </p>
<h4><a name="s4-4-5-5"></a>4.4.5.5. Harvest Quantity and Timing </h4>
<p>Harvesting is a procedure by which a forest stand is logged with an emphasis
  on meeting logging requirements while concurrently attaining silvicultural objectives.
  Harvest scheduling is a process for allocating cutting and other silvicultural
  treatments over a forest with an emphasis on which treatments to apply, as well
  as where and when to apply them. The practice relates to when the harvesting
  is done (thinnings including pre-commercial thinnings, selection fellings, or
  clear-fellings) and the timber volume extracted. </p>
<p>Harvest intensity significantly affects the quantity and quality of timber
  produced. The carbon sequestration impact therefore must be considered in connection
  with the end use of wood products that are manufactured from a particular harvest.
  For example, merely increasing the rotation time, lengthening the period between
  harvest operations, or reducing the volume extracted may lead to reduced growth
  rates and reduced sequestration opportunities in the forest, as well as less
  wood for bioenergy or replacement of energy-intensive products such as steel,
  aluminum, and concrete (Row, 1996). </p>
<p>Optimal thinning and clear-felling times (and quantities) are interlinked and
  dependent on other forest management measures (e.g., fertilization or plant
  density) and objectives. Hoen and Solberg (1994) analyzed combinations of thinnings,
  clear-fellings, and other silviculture measures (e.g., fertilization, types
  and intensity of regeneration) simultaneously for a boreal forest region, keeping
  harvesting levels constant and maximizing carbon storage (including end use
  and decay of wood products) for the region for a long period. The study illustrates
  that in such a situation, thinning and clear-felling times will be significant
  and complementary. For example, thinnings on good site classes substitute for
  clear-fellings on low site classes that have high standing volumes (but low
  annual growth and carbon sequestration potential if harvested). Boscola <i>et
  al.</i> (1997) show how the length of harvest cycles and minimum cutting diameters
  can be combined to produce maximum carbon sequestration; they arrive at a cost
  of US$1.20 t-1 C for an increase in cutting cycles from 40 to 50 years for lowland
  tropical rain forest in Malaysia. Other studies on this topic include Boscola
  and Buongiorno (1997), Hoen and Solberg (1997), and Plantinga and Birdsey (1994).
