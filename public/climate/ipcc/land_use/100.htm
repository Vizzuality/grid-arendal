<h5>2.5.1.1.5. Acidification </h5>
<p>When forests are planted on former non-forest lands, soils may become acidified
  through removal of base cations in harvested wood. In areas with high concentrations
  of polluted cloud water or reactive pollutant gases in the air (HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>,
  HN<span class="subscript">3</span>, and HCl), trees can also increase the transfer
  of those pollutants from the atmosphere to the ground (Fowler <i>et al.</i>,
  1989). This transfer can result in acidification of soil and waters and increase
  aluminum in waters, especially in areas with base-poor soils. This transfer
  can have detrimental effects on fish, invertebrates, vegetation, and perhaps
  trees themselves (Ormerod <i>et al.</i>, 1989; Kreiser <i>et al.</i>, 1990).
  The risk of enhanced acidification is a well-known constraint on afforestation
  in parts of Europe and North America. It may be a consideration in any country
  with high levels of acidifying air pollutants or in areas with soils of low
  buffer capacity where cation extraction exceeds mineralization (Last and Watling,
  1991). </p>
<h5><a name="s2-5-1-1-6"></a>2.5.1.1.6. Climate feedbacks </h5>
<p>Water cycling is another major environmental service of forests. One of the
  expected impacts that would result from a significant expansion of the extent
  of deforestation in Amazonia and other parts of Brazil would be a reduction
  in rainfall, especially during the dry season (Lean <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Similar
  effects have been calculated for the effects of forests on rainfall in the Indian
  subcontinent (Harding, 1992), and tropical forest protection has been shown
  to generate drought mitigation and flood mitigation benefits in Indonesia (Pattanayak
  and Kramer, 2000) and Madagascar (Kramer <i>et al.</i>, 1997). </p>
<p>Anthropogenic wildland fires release significant quantities of GHGs and have
  considerable socioeconomic and ecological impacts. For example, the 1997-1998
  wildland fires in southeast Asia resulted from extensive land clearing, exacerbated
  by unusually dry El Niï¿½o conditions. These fires adversely affected the health
  of an estimated 20 million people and produced extensive damage to the region's
  forests and biodiversity, at a total estimated cost of US$4.4 billion (EEPSEA/WWF,
  1998, as cited in Levine <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>The relatively high water use by forests compared with non-forest lands transfers
  more water to the atmosphere, with potential effects on local and regional climate
  if forest areas are very extensive. Although the magnitude of these feedbacks
  is the subject of contention, extensive forestation may increase humidity, lower
  temperature, and increase rainfall in temperate and tropical regions (Harding,
  1992; Blythe <i>et al.</i>, 1994). </p>
<p>Deforestation can lead to decreased local rainfall and increased temperature-most
  notably in Amazonia, where about 50 percent of rainfall originates from within
  the Amazon basin and the predicted decrease in rainfall and warming (after loss
  of forest) could make conditions unsuitable for subsequent regeneration of many
  rainforest species (Gash and Shuttleworth, 1991). Similarly, adverse impacts
  of reduced rainfall from deforestation have been documented in Asia (Chan, 1986;
  Meher-Homji, 1992). </p>
