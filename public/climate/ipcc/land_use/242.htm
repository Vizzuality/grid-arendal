<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.19. Restoration of Severely Degraded Land </h3>
<p>Severely degraded land is understood in this context to mean land that will
  not revert to its former state through good agricultural, rangeland management,
  or forestry practice alone. Practices include restoration of severely eroded
  land and land polluted with heavy metals or mine spoils (Bennett, 1977; Akala
  and Lal, 1999), as well as reclamation of deserts (Lal <i>et al.</i>, 1999b),
  saline soils (Glenn <i>et al.</i>, 1993), and alkaline soils (Garg, 1998; Sumner
  and Naidu, 1998). Section 3.2.5.7 discusses definitions and databases; Section
  4.6.1.4 includes a small discussion in relation to degraded forest soils. Other
  relevant categories include acidified soils; soils polluted with hydrocarbons;
  compacted, sealed, or crusted soils; and waterlogged and slumped soils. </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  The specific techniques needed depend on the nature of the degradation. The
  potential is large, but there is always a reason why land has become degraded;
  unless this cause is removed, restoration and carbon sequestration will not
  occur. Globally, very large areas are affected, although there is much variability
  in estimates of the extent of the problem. Most authors (Dregne <i>et al.</i>,
  1991; Glenn <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Gupta and Rao, 1994; Sumner and Raidu, 1998;
  Lal and Bruce, 1999; Lal <i>et al</i> 1999b) estimate, however, that no more
  than 20-40 percent of badly degraded land is restorable at a reasonable cost.
</p>
<p><b>Current Knowledge and Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  Eroded soil may have become unstable and susceptible to further erosion. Remaining
  soil may be highly weathered and lacking basic fertility to permit restoration
  by growing crops, in particular hyperaccumulators or soil microorganisms. Where
  land has become degraded-for example, by overgrazing-the underlying cause must
  be addressed, or the overgrazing is likely to happen again once vegetation is
  restored. Certain soils are always going to be susceptible simply because of
  their constitution; stabilizing these soils or achieving anything other than
  low amounts of carbon stocks may be impossible. Remaining fertility may be extremely
  variable across a site, making restoration patchy. Resistance to further erosion
  depends partly on establishing full vegetative cover to provide protection from
  the action of wind or water. </p>
<p><b>Time Scales </b><br>
  Highly degraded soils often start from a low carbon base in relation to undisturbed
  conditions. Given this difficulty, full restoration of the soil may take many
  years. The combination of large potential and low rates, however, means that
  some degraded lands could function as a sink for very many years-perhaps more
  than half a century. </p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, and Transparency </b><br>
  Monitoring depends on the sequestration/revegetation method chosen. The extent
  or effectiveness of vegetation cover can be monitored by using satellites, and
  carbon can be estimated in the usual way. Soil carbon can be estimated using
  models and verified by taking samples on-site. If a soil is still susceptible
  to erosion, there is a danger that erosion may continue during the monitoring
  period. The height and location of soil may need to be referenced. Removal of
  organic pollutants requires special treatment. This practice is as verifiable
  as any other means of changing soil carbon stocks. Organic pollutants may cause
  problems that require special attention. Transparency depends on the method
  of analysis chosen. Uncertainty may be greatest if erosion continues to remove
  soil or if the original pollutant is organic. </p>
<p><b>Permanence</b><br>
  If degraded soils start from a low carbon stock, the permanence of additional
  carbon is probably high, but adequate measures must be taken to prevent repeat
  degradation. </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  This practice may lead to an increase in aboveground biomass on soil that previously
  could not support cropping; increased fertility and profitability; reduced erosion
  and environmental problems such as landslip and silting of water courses; and
  "recycling" of land where land is scarce. </p>
<p><b>Relationship to IPCC Guidelines </b><br>
  The Guidelines do not explicitly deal with restoration of severely degraded
  lands. Changes in soil carbon stocks could be incorporated similarly to what
  is done with conversions to set-asides, provided appropriate time-dependent
  "Base Factors" were determined. Changes in non-woody biomass stocks for restoration
  of degraded lands are not included in the Guidelines. </p>
