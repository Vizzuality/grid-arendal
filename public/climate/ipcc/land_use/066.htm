<h4>2.3.3.2. Direct versus Indirect </h4>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol distinguishes between direct and indirect human-induced
  land-use change and forestry activities. The word "direct" precedes the phrase
  "human-induced" in Article 3.3 but not in Article 3.4. Temporal and spatial
  immediacy may indicate directness; the closer in time and space the activity
  is to the impact, the more direct it is. Intent and foreseeability also might
  be relevant in determining directness. </p>
<p>One of the most significant distinctions between direct activities and indirect
  influences relates to the effects of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fertilization and nitrogen deposition.
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fertilization and nitrogen deposition are indirect because the removals
  are not geographically immediate-that is, they may occur thousands of miles
  from the site of the emissions. The fact that enhanced growth of biota is a
  completely unintended consequence of the polluting activity also argues in favor
  of treating it as an indirect activity. Moreover, CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fertilization and nitrogen
  deposition cannot reasonably be described as land-use change or forestry activities.
</p>
<p>At the global scale, carbon cycle studies suggest that terrestrial ecosystems
  that are not subject to tropical deforestation are sequestering an average of
  approximately 2.2 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> through biomass regrowth resulting from natural
  regeneration and uptake of carbon dioxide, as well as nutrient fertilization
  and changing climate (see <a href="014.htm">Chapter 1</a>). The geographic distribution
  of this sink is uncertain, but if credit became available for the effects of
  carbon and/or nitrogen fertilization over a large fraction of the landscape,
  the implications would be profound. If Parties could obtain credit for 50 percent
  of the estimated sink from these factors, achieving the emission limitations
  of the first commitment period would not require any actions beyond business-as-usual
  projections (Lashof and Hare, 1999). Accounting inconsistencies also could arise
  if credit could be taken under the Kyoto Protocol for CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and 
  nitrogen fertilization.<a href="fn3.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(3,2); return false;"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, completely excluding these effects from crediting may be
  impractical because current methods cannot precisely determine either the total
  or incremental amounts of uptake attributable to CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and nitrogen fertilization.
  Indeed, estimates of carbon uptake from forest inventory data continue to suggest
  a much smaller current terrestrial carbon sink than that inferred from atmospheric
  measurements (Holland and Brown, 1999; Lashof and Hare, 1999). At a project
  level, however, an approach that compares a "with-project" scenario to a "without-project"
  scenario should control for much of the fertilization effect because both scenarios
  will be subject to fertilization. As <a href="067.htm">Section 2.3.4</a> notes,
  a similar approach could be applied at the national level under Article 3.4,
  but use of a baseline may not be practical or important to accounting under
  Article 3.3. </p>
