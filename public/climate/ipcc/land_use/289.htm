<h3>5.6.3. Extent and Effectiveness of Local Community Participation in Project
  Development and Implementation</h3>
<p>The involvement of local communities that directly depend on forest resources
  is a precondition for the success of community-based projects. Local communities
  can be involved by designing a project to develop local skills, create employment
  in the project, and promote equity, all of which will lead to the long-term
  sustainability of the project activity. In the Scolel Te project, for instance,
  local communities and their agroforestry traditions are included in the project
  design process (Imaz <i>et al.</i>, 1998). On the other hand, the ECOLAND project
  in Costa Rica has caused discontent among local residents who did not sell their
  lands and now face hardships caused by the inclusion of their lands in a national
  park (Goldberg, 1998). It is also important that the host country and the project
  designers recognize the land titles and legal rights of indigenous people to
  ensure their effective participation in the project (see <a href="#box5-5">Box
  5-5</a> for a case involving the social forestry program in India). </p>

	<p>Several developmental projects in the forestry sector have been implemented
	  in the tropics that could be sources for understanding the possible
	  implications of future LULUCF projects. One such afforestation program
	  implemented in India was funded by several donor agencies during the
	  1980s. In terms of number of trees planted (18,876 million trees in
	  1980-87, Chambers <i>et al.</i>, 1989), the project was a success. The
	  lessons learned from the program are briefly described below (Saxena,
	  1997).</p>
	<p>Social forestry projects were implemented by the Forest Department
	  in India with the goal of meeting the demands of rural people and reducing
	  the burden on production forestry. The species planted in the village
	  commons and revenue lands were mainly monocultures of <i>Eucalyptus,
	  Casuarina,</i> and <i>Acacia</i> sp. Tree planting and management was
	  carried out by the Forest Department in the initial years and later
	  handed over to the Panchayat (village governing body).</p>
	<p><i>Local Participation</i><br>
	  The selection of species reflected the choice of the Forest Department
	  rather than the local preferences. Participation was limited to a few
	  members of the village elite. Community involvement was limited to handing
	  over the common land for plantation and participation as wage labor.
	  In designing the project, foresters and foreign experts did not fully
	  grasp the complexity of the rural power structure and assumed that the
	  village Panchayats represented the interests of all concerned in the
	  village (SIDA, 1992). Thus, a large portion of the benefit from the
	  project went to the urban areas, industries, and retailers-defeating
	  the purpose of the project. </p>
	<p><i>Land Tenure</i><br>
	  Throughout the social forestry phase, it was not clear whether village
	  land belonged to the Forest Department, the Revenue Department, or the
	  village body. Such uncertainty about ownership and legal rights impeded
	  community action. Non-forest laws often conflicted with the social forestry
	  projects. </p>
	<p><i>Technical Issues</i><br>
	  Species selection, spacing, and other silvicultural issues were not
	  properly examined and implemented. Benefits that could flow to poor
	  villagers from species yielding intermediate products were not properly
	  appreciated. The production of grass, legumes, leaf fodder, fruits,
	  and non-timber forest products was neglected. Close spacing was prescribed
	  to avoid intermediate management options, reduce plantation costs, and
	  cut down on staff supervision time. As a consequence, thinning and pruning,
	  which could have produced intermediate yields of grass and tree products
	  for the people, were not undertaken (Saxena, 1997). Because of the close
	  spacing, grass production was affected. Because projects were designed
	  around the ultimate felling of the planted trees, degradation often
	  set in after the trees were harvested.</p>
	<p><i>Policy Issues</i><br>
	  The failure to define, establish, and publicize the rights for marketing
	  and allocating benefits to the community led to the failure of their
	  participation. Rights to trees and a distribution policy that were not
	  official preoccupations in the early stages of the tree planting led
	  to inequitable distribution later.</p>
	<p><i>Equity Issues</i><br>
	  A government review found that only 20 percent of the respondents knew
	  about the woodlots during the planning stage, only 14 percent of the
	  people participated in the meetings, and about 83 percent of the low-status
	  people were adversely affected by the closure of the community land.
	  The landless farmers and artisans depend on the village commons to graze
	  their animals and collect fuelwood.</p>
	<p><i>Capacity-Building</i><br>
	  The funding projects provided the Forest Department with vehicles and
	  foreign training, but little emphasis was given to building the capacity
	  of the Forest Department. </p>
	<p><i>Multiplicity of Donors </i><br>
	  Multiplicity of donors with different priorities within single provinces
	  resulted in conflicting policies being followed. </p>

<p>In bioenergy projects, local people could be trained in the operation and maintenance
  of biogas plants; this training could lead to the creation of new jobs in rural
  areas and reduce migration to urban centers, thereby achieving equitable development
  between rural and urban areas (Ravindranath and Hall, 1995). It would also promote
  the sustainability of the project by providing financial, social, and environmental
  benefits even after the investors have withdrawn. </p>
<p>The success of community management projects also depends on equitable discussion,
  participation, and distribution of benefits, which is crucial for the development
  of rural areas (Sokona <i>et al.</i>, 1999). It is important to have institutional
  arrangements to ensure land tenure and product ownership by local communities
  or to meaningfully involve local participants in decision-making processes regarding
  species choice, mode of production, harvesting, and benefit sharing that encourages
  them to commit themselves to the protection and management of LULUCF projects.
