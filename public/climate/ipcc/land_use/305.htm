<h2>6.3. Adequacy of the IPCC Guidelines for Reporting National Activities under
  the Kyoto Protocol </h2>
<p>This section assesses the adequacy of the Guidelines in relation to activities
  under Articles 3.3 and 3.4. It begins with a discussion of reporting issues
  common to ARD, then addresses issues that are specific to deforestation. </p>
<h3><a name="s6-3-1"></a>6.3.1. Afforestation, Reforestation, and Deforestation
  under Article 3.3 </h3>
<h4><a name="s6-3-1-1"></a>6.3.1.1. Generic Issues on Afforestation, Reforestation,
  and Deforestation</h4>
<p>In the Guidelines, stock changes arising from afforestation and reforestation
  activities are reported under the same category, "Changes in forest and woody
  biomass stocks." For accounting purposes, there is no distinction between afforestation
  and reforestation; the same method is used for both. Deforestation can be dealt
  with separately, according to the principles for accounting of "Forest and Grassland
  Conversion." <a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a> explores a range of possible definitions
  of ARD. <a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a> further explores a wide range of definitional
  scenarios, including that of the FAO. If Parties choose the IPCC definitions,
  afforestation and reforestation can be dealt with using the principles in the
  Guidelines. For discussion only, this section assumes that the principles of
  afforestation and reforestation are the same as those in the Guidelines. </p>
<p>There would be implications for all three ARD activities if Parties were to
  adopt an extension beyond the Workbook. Carbon pools are limited to changes
  in aboveground biomass and soil carbon in the Workbook. Additional carbon pools
  are discussed in and can be accounted for using the approach laid out in the
  Reference Manual. According to the rules, modalities, and guidelines agreed
  to under Articles 3.3 and 5.2, however, Parties may decide that accounting methods
  for these additional carbon pools may need to be developed and provided in the
  Workbook. </p>
<p>The calculations in the Workbook do not explicitly link the aboveground biomass
  and soil carbon pools for a specific activity. To resolve this issue, reporting
  of ARD for aboveground and below-ground biomass could be geographically explicit
  (mapped) or linked through modeling, or the accounting methods for these pools
  could be slightly modified. The same principle would apply to the linking of
  other carbon pools, such as more complete treatment of surface soil litter,
  below-ground biomass, and wood products (see <a href="309.htm#s6-3-3">Section
  6.3.3</a>). Geographically explicit reporting and modification of accounting
  methods are not expected to be difficult to implement, although data can be
  expensive to obtain on a large scale, however, even for Parties with a good
  deal of scientific infrastructure (see <a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Furthermore,
  the data would have to be reported at appropriate time intervals in all cases
  and with consideration of the "since 1990" time clause. </p>
<p>All three ARD activities cause changes in aboveground biomass. Closely linked
  to the issue of ARD is the definition of forests, which has implications for
  lands that are included in an inventory (see <a href="038.htm">Chapters 2</a>
  and <a href="112.htm">3</a>). If Parties adopt definitions for forests other
  than the existing ones, the Guidelines may have to be improved to account for
  the new definitions. Changing these definitions by forest ecosystem or crown
  cover is unlikely to have significant implications on the Guidelines; the approach
  for estimating changes in aboveground biomass is expected to remain similar.
  If Parties adopted definitions of ARD activities that differed from the IPCC
  definitions, however, more significant improvements to the Guidelines might
  be required-depending on how the regeneration and harvest cycle were treated,
  for example. </p>
<p>If a land-based accounting system (<a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a>) were to
  apply, a generic issue for ARD is that there may be a need to separately identify
  land into ARD categories and report land categorization in 1990, as well as
  in the commitment period. The optimum size of the landscape unit at which ARD
  activities may be detected is another consideration (<a href="112.htm">Chapter
  3</a>). </p>
<p>If an activity-based accounting system (<a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a>) were
  to apply, another solution might be possible. Differentiation among categories
  can be made at the beginning of a commitment period (in 2008, in the first instance)
  on the basis of activities implemented prior to 2008. In this system, the impact
  of an activity on carbon stocks could be tracked and summed per unit area. Carbon
  stocks would be more difficult to verify under this system, however, than those
  tracked under a land-based accounting system (see <a href="038.htm">Chapter
  2</a>). <br>
  For reporting of ARD under both the land-based or activity-based systems, the
  activities and the areas subject to these activities since 1 January 1990 would
  have to be identified. The Guidelines do not currently apply this time clause
  to such land areas. The Guidelines require the use of land areas and ARD activities
  to estimate changes in carbon stock, however; hence, either a land-based or
  activity-based system could be used to track aboveground biomass and soil carbon.
</p>
<p>To more accurately account for changes in carbon stocks under ARD, a finer
  level of geographic detail and subcategories may be appropriate. Stocks estimates
  could be improved by reflecting forest management type, species, soil type,
  and so forth, as well as by substituting default assumptions with national or
  region-specific data and assumptions from local sources (IPCC, 1997, Vol. 3,
  p 5.15). </p>
<p>On the other hand, if changes in stocks associated with ARD activities were
  reported at aggregated levels, reporting could be made geographically explicit
  at an appropriate scale, with geo-referencing of stocks according to species,
  forest type, and age of stand. The same principle applies with regard to verifying
  that a forest qualifies as ARD land and verifying changes in these stocks. Geo-referencing
  in itself does not provide transparency. The Guidelines would not be adequate
  for this purpose. A well-designed national system, together with the application
  of good practice, may be needed to ensure verifiability and transparency of
  reported data. </p>
<p>In relation to ARD, examples of data or assumptions that may be reported include
  the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Forest inventories at the required level of accuracy (IPCC, 1997, Vol. 3,
    p. 5.16). New methods based on satellite and aerial photography are also available
    for large-scale measurements, but only of area. Generic treatment for data
    quality is covered in the GPG.</li>
  <li>Conversion factors appropriate to categories of forests (IPCC, 1997, Vol.
    3, p. 5.18) for estimating tons of biomass per unit volume of commercial timber
    and tons of carbon per ton of dry biomass. </li>
  <li> Biomass densities appropriate to the mix of species in the growing stock
    of a particular region could be used, based on literature data or field measurements
    (IPCC, 1997, Vol. 3, p. 5.22). Any default values would have to be age-class
    dependent, especially because stands established since 1990 will be very young
    during the commitment period, and expansion factors tend to be significantly
    higher for young stands. </li>
  <li>The same principles apply to below-ground biomass (coarse woody roots, etc.)
    and to forest litter (dead roots, slash, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>All three ARD activities can affect the level of soil carbon. Although the
  Guidelines can be readily applied to account for ARD, they focus on agricultural
  land use and management, rather than ARD. For comprehensive carbon accounting,
  soil carbon components of soil surface litter could be included. Consideration
  would have to be given to soil depth and rates of change in carbon, as appropriate.
  In cropped soils, however, most changes occur in the upper 30 cm (<a href="038.htm">Chapter
  2</a>), as assumed in the Workbook. In some situations, consideration of deep
  soil carbon and more types of soil humus, with differing rates of decomposition,
  might be necessary for ARD activities. Significant changes may occur at 30-50
  cm depth-for example, in deep tropical soils (see <a href="038.htm">Chapters
  2</a> and <a href="157.htm">4</a>), where changes in soil carbon are generally
  faster than in boreal areas. Consistency in the accounting rules may need to
  be established, especially if crediting for soil carbon is allowed. </p>
<p>With respect to soil carbon, other refinements to the Guidelines may include
  the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Use of soil carbon models or methods with realistic time dependencies that
    reflect the soil type, moisture, and temperature conditions. In the IPCC default
    method, changes are assumed to be linear in time, so a straight averaging
    of past rates of change of land use is used. In the Protocol context, changes
    in stock resulting from increase or decay of soil carbon could be calculated
    using a time course (e.g., exponential) appropriate to the region and the
    commitment period in light of local conditions. This approach will give greater
    weight to more recent events. </li>
  <li>Use of improved soil carbon data from surveys, field studies, and long-term
    agricultural experiments to replace default values.</li>
  <li>Use of geo-referencing to relate data on base factors, tillage factors,
    and input factors and initial soil carbon content (IPCC, 1997, Vol. 2, p.
    5.25) that is transparently reported with aboveground biomass changes. The
    base factor refers to the change in soil organic matter that is associated
    with the conversion of native vegetation to agriculture (IPCC, 1997, Vol.
    3, p. 5.47). The term "initial" is used here rather than "native" to take
    into account that deforestation may be of forest that had been disturbed sometime
    in the historical past.</li>
  <li> As discussed in <a href="309.htm#s6-3-3">Section 6.3.3</a>, changes in
    carbon wood products could be considered (Winjum <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Brown
    <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </li>
</ul>
<p>A key question is whether averaging periods for data are appropriate. Changes
  in biomass are linked to climatic fluctuations, so changes in stocks between
  2008 and 2012 could be depressed or boosted by unusual weather patterns. Such
  fluctuations may affect stock changes over the commitment period for afforestation
  and reforestation or regrowth after deforestation. Separating the observed stock
  change that is directly human-induced from the influence of indirect causes
  and natural variability is generally difficult. One possibility is the use of
  default data to smooth out the effects of natural variability and extreme climatic
  events. This use of default data would deviate, however, from the principles
  of the Guidelines. <br>
  Because the Guidelines do not fully address the issue of uncertainties (Lim
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999b), the reporting of ARD activities could be modified to
  include treatment of uncertainties and methods for error propagation-using,
  for example, Monte Carlo analyses or standardized calculation methods. Uncertainties
  in measurements of stocks at two points in time (e.g., 2008 and 2012) may cancel
  out for systematic errors. Under the gross-net approach of Article 3.3, however,
  the uncertainties would not cancel out for 1990 and the commitment period: For
  1990, the uncertainties would comprise the non-LUCF sectors (gross) only, whereas
  for the commitment period the uncertainties would be the net of the uncertainties
  of estimates in non-LUCF and LUCF sectors. </p>
