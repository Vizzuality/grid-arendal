<h4>4.4.5.2. Forest Fertilization </h4>
<p>Fertilization is the addition of nutrient elements to increase growth rate
  or overcome a nutrient deficiency in the soil. Effective fertilization can entail
  either an increase in the quantity of fertilizer or an improvement in application
  through the selection of compounds, timing, and dosage so that as much fertilizer
  as possible is taken up by trees and less becomes waste to groundwater. Unintentional
  fertilization is occurring in many forests that are downwind of industrial centers,
  as a result of the deposition of nitrogen and sulfur from the atmosphere. </p>
<p>Appropriate fertilization leads to higher growth rates of aboveground and below-ground
  biomass, thereby increasing carbon storage. The process is well understood except
  for some of the soil processes, and in many countries reliable models are available
  to predict increased biomass growth. Fertilization may have negative associated
  environmental impacts because it can increase the emission of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O and NO<span class="subscript">X</span> to
  air and water and influence soil processes. Few studies exist on forest fertilization
  as a method of carbon sequestration (e.g., Lunnan <i>et al.</i>, 1991; Hoen
  and Solberg, 1994; Nabuurs <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<h4><a name="s4-4-5-3"></a>4.4.5.3. Fire Management </h4>
<p>"Fire management" describes activities that are required for the protection
  of wildland values from fire, as well as the use of fire to meet land management
  objectives. Fire management is usually carried out in an attempt to produce
  less damaging wildfires through lowered fire intensity and severity. Fire management
  can entail changing the type of fire (i.e., reducing the chances of a lethal
  crown fire by thinning a stand so that a subsequent fire will be a cooler, surface
  fire) or increasing the frequency of intentional fires to reduce the chance
  that fuels will build to levels that will support a severe wildfire. For several
  types of forests, such activities increase the standing stock and reduce the
  risk of large, severe wildfires that may cause soil damage, nutrient depletion,
  and watershed damage (MacDonald <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Although prescribed fires
  produce a variety of GHGs and particulate pollution, if managed properly they
  may reduce time-averaged emissions from some forest ecosystems (Neuenschwander
  and Sampson, 2000). In extreme situations, severe wildfires can so degrade a
  site that forest recovery may be delayed, a totally different ecosystem may
  emerge, or desertification may begin (Cromack et al., 2000). Fire management
  is complicated and must be viewed in connection with the long-term health of
  the particular forest ecosystem involved, as well as harvest and wood utilization
  practices. Burning aboveground and below-ground biomass, humus, and soil increases
  the emission of carbon and other GHGs (Goldammer, 1990; Dixon and Krankina,
  1993; Price <i>et al.</i>, 1998). </p>
<p>Globally, forest burning releases large quantities of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, about 10 percent
  of annual global CH<span class="subscript">4</span> emissions, and 10-20 percent of global N<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions-a
  significant effect on atmospheric chemistry (IPCC, 1992). In the United States,
  effective fire suppression for the past century has dramatically reduced wildfire
  emissions and atmospheric pollution, but it also has restored high-risk fuel
  conditions that are now a major policy concern (Leenhouts, 1998; Sampson <i>et
  al.</i>, 2000). Forest ecosystems that developed with fire as a major ecosystem
  process (i.e., nearly all forests)-even those where fires, though infrequent,
  generally killed most or all of the trees (i.e., boreal forests)-could be expected
  to re-assimilate the CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emitted during the growing period between fires, provided
  that the fire frequency as measured over large regions is relatively unchanging.
  The latter requirement may no longer hold true in many parts of the world because
  of human intervention and climate change (Apps <i>et al.</i>, 1999a). </p>
