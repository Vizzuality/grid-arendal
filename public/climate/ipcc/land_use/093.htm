<h4>2.4.4.5. Future Remote-Sensing Systems </h4>
<p>Many remote-sensing systems are expected to be implemented over the next several
  years, and plans exist for many more between now and the first commitment period.
  These systems include missions recently launched by the United States (including
  public and private systems), India, Brazil and China, Europe, Japan, and others.
  A detailed description of the plans for all of these systems is beyond the scope
  of this section. </p>
<p>Several points are important in the context of the first commitment period
  (and beyond), however. Currently, there is no published national or international
  commitment to ensure that remote-sensing measurements adequate to determine
  areas of forest clearing and regrowth will be collected during the first commitment
  period. Systems that currently provide such information-such as Landsat, SPOT,
  IRS, and CBERS-have current operational lifetimes that nominally end before
  the first commitment period begins. Ensuring that remote-sensing data adequate
  to this task will be available will require public and possibly private investment
  and a commitment by governments to ensure its availability. The situation with
  respect to remotely sensed data for ecosystem metabolism models and fire detection
  is less uncertain. Under current plans, these data will be included in joint
  U.S.-European meteorological missions that are projected to orbit during the
  first commitment period. </p>
<h3><a name="s2-4-5"></a>2.4.5. Models </h3>
<p>Bookkeeping models have been used for years to calculate the effects of land-use
  change on terrestrial carbon storage (Moore <i>et al.</i>, 1981; Houghton <i>et
  al.</i>, 1983; Woodwell <i>et al.</i>, 1983). The same models may be used to
  calculate annual emissions and accumulations of carbon at any scale-from the
  project level to national, regional, and global levels. Two types of information
  are required: rates of land-use change (e.g., areas cleared annually for croplands,
  cubic meters of wood annually harvested) and per-hectare changes in carbon stocks
  following a change in land use (including changes in living vegetation, logging
  debris, harvested products, and soil carbon). The IPCC Guidelines are based
  on simplifications of these models. These models generally consider only fluxes
  of carbon resulting from land-use change, including forestry. They do not include
  the indirect effects of human-induced changes, such as climate, CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, or nitrogen
  deposition. </p>
<p>A similar set of bookkeeping models that include natural disturbances such
  as fire, insects, or wind-throw have been used to determine the carbon balance
  for large areas of forest (e.g., Kurz and Apps, 1995, 1999). These models require
  a third type of information-namely, areas annually disturbed by these factors,
  as well as by harvesting. </p>
<p>Process-based models do include the effects of environmental variables on the
  carbon dynamics of ecosystems; such models have some potential for estimating
  natural as well as human-induced changes in carbon stocks. These models also
  have the potential to extrapolate site-based measurements temporally and spatially;
  to attribute changes in carbon stock to direct human-induced and naturally occurring
  change; and to estimate emissions or consumption of trace gases such as NO<span class="subscript">X</span>,
  N<span class="subscript">2</span>O, and CH<span class="subscript">4</span>-although the current capacity to do so is not sufficiently accurate
  for emissions trading purposes. Before these models can be used to assess changes
  in carbon stocks, they must be thoroughly documented, evaluated against independent
  data sets (e.g., from long-term forestry or agronomic experiments), and, if
  necessary, calibrated for local conditions. Such models, when correctly parameterized,
  can be effectively used at the time scale of the commitment period, but their
  use over longer periods may be limited. </p>
<p>The range of available models enables simulation of carbon dynamics at various
  scales, from plot level (<1 ha) to global level. As the scale increases, the
  spatial resolution of the model decreases and the input data become more aggregated.
  Some models deal with single ecosystem components such as soil (e.g., RothC;
  Falloon <i>et al.</i>, 1998), whereas others simulate whole ecosystems (e.g.,
  Century; Parton <i>et al.</i>, 1987). Other models operate at the biome level
  and are most often applied at the continental and global scale (Meentenmeyer
  et al., 1985; Heimann <i>et al.</i>, 1998). To estimate and project changes
  in carbon stock for particular locations or specific combinations of environmental
  and management conditions, detailed biogeochemical process models can be employed.
  Such models have high data input requirements and may need particular calibration
  or parameters for individual locations. Model drivers include parameters such
  as soil clay content and topographic position, as well as climate data and land
  management information. Several reviews describe many of these models in detail
  (e.g., McVoy <i>et al.</i>, 1995; Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1997c; Heimann <i>et
  al.</i>, 1998). </p>
<p>The use of models to estimate changes in carbon stock may result in a loss
  of transparency because the modeling process can be very complex. If models
  are used, they must be documented and archived in the form in which they were
  used (including source code and input files), and the validation data must form
  part of the reporting requirement. With a view to using models for subsequent
  inventories, it is suggested that initial inventories gather data to evaluate
  model outputs in addition to measures that are required solely for inventory
  purposes. The incremental cost of doing so is small, and the data can be used
  for cross-validation. </p>
