<h4>4.4.7.2. Badly Eroded and Desertified Soils </h4>
<p>Eroded soils have a large potential for carbon sequestration if the erosion
  can be halted to prevent the further loss of sequestered carbon. In many cases,
  much fertile topsoil has already been lost, and the soil may need fertilizers
  to support restoration. Soil structure and stability are of great importance
  if soil is to avoid further damage; in some cases, the addition of clay or silt
  may be needed. </p>
<p>Of a total estimated area of 2,000 Mha of degraded land (Oldeman, 1994), badly
  eroded land constitutes about 1,200 Mha; 250 Mha of this eroded land is considered
  to be severely eroded (Paustian <i>et al.</i>, 1998b). Almost half of the severely
  eroded land area (112 Mha) is in Africa; 88 Mha are in Asia, and 37 and 13 Mha
  are in Latin America and Europe, respectively. Lal and Bruce (1999) consider
  100 Mha of land worldwide to be so badly degraded that it is unsuitable for
  agriculture; assuming a sequestration rate of 0.25 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>, these lands have
  a global potential to sequester 0.025 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>. Lal <i>et al.</i> (1999b) report
  that 3,500-4,000 Mha of land are susceptible to desertification throughout the
  world; much of this land is rangeland or degraded tropical forests (see <a href="177.htm">Sections
  4.4.3</a> and <a href="182.htm">4.4.4</a>). Desertified cropland constitutes
  757 Mha. </p>
<p>Activities instigated to combat degradation and desertification include irrigation
  with silt-rich water; land stabilization and revegetation; enclosures to restrict
  grazing; and recovery of buried, fertile soils (Fullen and Mitchell, 1994).
  In the tropical and subtropical regions of China, about 48 Mha are regarded
  as "wasteland"-of which about 6 percent could be restored as pasture (Li and
  Zhao, 1998). In India, there are estimated to be more than 100 Mha of land in
  which organic carbon can be as low as 0.2 percent (Gupta and Rao, 1994). Revegetation
  of 35 Mha of these lands with suitable grass and multi-purpose trees could sequester
  up to 0.84 and 1.06 Gt C in vegetation and soil, respectively. Increase in soil
  carbon following cultivation is considerably enhanced by the introduction of
  legume trees or shrubs into the perennial pasture (e.g., Prinsloo <i>et al.</i>,
  1990). The global potential from restoration of desertified lands is estimated
  at 1.0-1.4 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> (Squires <i>et al.</i>, 1995; Lal <i>et al.</i>, 1999b);
  the potentials estimated in <a href="199.htm#table4-11">Table 4-11</a> are more
  conservative because they assume that only a fraction of the affected land is
  likely to be treated, given economic and other constraints. </p>
<p>The potential for aboveground increases in carbon stocks in degraded lands
  following afforestation may be about 2-3 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>; potential increases
  in soil carbon are probably on the order of 0.25 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (Lal <i>et al.</i>,
  1999a). Rehabilitation of severely degraded lands was estimated to have the
  potential to store 0.14 Gt C in the 0-10 cm soil layer in northeast Australia;
  such rehabilitation, however, would require higher cost inputs (Ash <i>et al.</i>,
  1996) that have not yet been assessed for financial viability. The rate of establishment
  of perennial grasses appears to determine the rate of recovery of soil carbon
  (Burke <i>et al.</i>, 1995), and soil carbon can be lost from these systems-through
  a combination of inappropriate management and drought years-much more quickly
  than it can be replaced (Northup and Brown, 1999). Thus, a continuity of management
  purpose is required to maintain or increase soil carbon reliably. </p>
