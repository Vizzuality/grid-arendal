<h3>4.6.4. Banking of Emissions Offsets </h3>
<p>Article 12.10 of the Kyoto Protocol permits any certified emissions reduction
  from the year 2000 (8 years prior to the first commitment period) to be used
  to achieve compliance during the first commitment period under the CDM. This
  provision could have the effect of encouraging participation by non-Annex B
  countries and stimulating early implementation of activities that reduce emissions.
  Recognizing the slow rate at which biomass activities sequester carbon compared
  to the high rate at which they can discharge carbon, as well as the associated
  advantages of early implementation of improved land-management activities, the
  Parties could choose to permit this sort of banking for early credits under
  Article 3.4 activities. This strategy might encourage early adoption of sustainable
  land-management practices; it would also create additional credits that would
  permit Annex B countries to more easily meet their commitments in the first
  commitment period. </p>
<h3><a name="s4-6-5"></a>4.6.5. Capturing Both Increases and Decreases in Carbon
  Stocks</h3>
<p>Article 3.4 permits Parties to choose whether to include these additional activities
  in meeting commitments during the first commitment period. Without appropriate
  guidance or the adoption of a full and symmetrical accounting system (see <a href="038.htm">Chapter
  2</a> and <a href="166.htm#figure4-5">Figure 4-5</a>), a Party might be able
  to select projects or activities that provide a net sink for carbon without
  accounting for those that are a net source. This type of selection could encourage
  adoption of desirable land-management activities in some places with no net
  gain for the atmosphere if countervailing choices are made elsewhere. </p>
<p>A partial solution to this potential problem would be to adopt any additional
  activities allowed for credit under Article 3.4 through a single decision that
  required acceptance of all activities or none in one package. This approach
  could ensure that a Party that chose to apply the decision to the first commitment
  period would have to account for the net effect of all of the additional activities.
  A full accounting approach for all changes in carbon stocks would also avoid
  this problem. </p>
<h3><a name="s4-6-6"></a>4.6.6. Adjusting Credits from Changes in Carbon Stocks</h3>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol currently treats all GHG flows equally, in CO<span class="subscript">2</span>-equivalent
  units: A ton of carbon is a ton of carbon, whether it is from fossil fuel combustion
  or is sequestered by reforestation. An alternative approach would be to treat
  different flows of carbon differently by giving partial, limited, or exaggerated
  credit for some carbon flows with respect to others or by putting a cap on the
  credits or debits available from a particular sink or source. Four reasons have
  been suggested for choosing to treat different flows of carbon differently:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encouraging emissions reductions in other sectors</li>
  <li>Compensating for uncertainty in measurement</li>
  <li>Compensating for differences in permanence</li>
  <li>Compensating for leakage.</li>
</ul>
<p>One could choose an adjustment factor that is greater or less than 1 to encourage
  sequestration in the biosphere or to discourage it with respect to other mitigation
  strategies. Such an approach could be applied to provide differential encouragement
  for different activities. A system might be designed to reward improvements
  with respect to uncertainty, permanence, or leakage. For example, providing
  credits at the 90-percent confidence level for estimates of changes in carbon
  stocks would reward improved accuracy in measurement with additional credits
  (Canada, 1998). There is a risk that valuing different carbon flows differently
  could lead to outcomes that are not economically efficient or environmentally
  optimal. </p>
