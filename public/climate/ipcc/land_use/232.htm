<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.9. Fire Management in Grasslands </h3>
<p>Fire management entails changing burning regimes to alter carbon pools in the
  landscape. </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  Fire often is an essential tool in pastoral lands for controlling woody weeds,
  removing dead biomass, stimulating regrowth, hunting, controlling pests, and
  clearing land. In many areas, fire regimes are strongly influenced by human
  actions such as controlled burning, back-burning, firebreaks, and rapid response.
  Reduced fire frequency or fire prevention tends to increase mean soil, biomass,
  and litter carbon levels (Jones et al., 1990). In particular, fire management
  increases the density of woody species in many landscapes (Archer, 1994; Archer
  et al., 1995; Scholes and Archer, 1997). </p>
<p>The magnitude of carbon storage associated with woody growth can be large.
  In the Orinoco Llanos, for example, protection from fires for 25 years increased
  the total carbon pool by a mean of 1.4 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>; carbon stocks increased
  by 5.6 and 29 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> in the vegetation and soil pools, respectively. If open
  forest is allowed to form, up to 5.69 Gt C may accumulate over 51 years, if
  extrapolated over the full area of the Orinoco Plains (28 Mha) (San Jose <i>et
  al.</i>, 1998). Similarly, in 60 Mha of savanna lands in northeastern Australia,
  Burrows et al. (1998, 2000) report that management and environmental changes
  (predominantly decreased fire frequency) are increasing carbon pools by 30 Mt
  yr<sup>-1</sup> in aboveground woody biomass and 10 Mt C yr<sup>-1</sup> in below-ground woody biomass;
  aboveground biomass pools could increase 2-5 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> (open grassland) to 15-75
  t C ha<sup>-1</sup> (closed woodland), and similar changes in below-ground biomass stocks
  can be expected (Burrows <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Similar changes have been found
  in Africa (northern Guinea savanna): Protection from burning for 26 years resulted
  in large increases in tree density and basal area compared with burned plots,
  as well as increases in soil carbon concentrations (Brookman-Amissah <i>et al.</i>,
  1980). Scholes and Hall (1996) suggest that increased tree cover in savannas
  could be contributing a worldwide sink of 2 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>. This potential could
  be limited in parts of Africa and South America, however, because of population
  pressures on land use and in other regions because of changes toward more sustainable
  stocking rates that will increase burning opportunities for woody vegetation
  management (Hall <i>et al.</i>, 1998). </p>
<p>Optimizing fire timing may increase biomass in some systems while increasing
  productivity. Conventional spring and autumn burning in some perennial grasslands,
  for example, have a long-term negative effect on live biomass and standing crop;
  midsummer burns facilitate more effective recovery of the grasses (Cox and Morton,
  1986). In some ecosystems, burning has little effect on aboveground or below-ground
  biomass (e.g., Senthilkumar <i>et al.</i>, 1998). </p>
<p>Charcoal generated by fires can constitute 8 g C kg-1 soil and represent up
  to 30 percent of the soil carbon content of some Australian soils (Skjemstad
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996); it probably constitutes a significant part of the inert
  or passive soil carbon pool. Reduction or removal of fire will result over long
  periods (several centuries) in reduction of this pool. </p>
<p><b>Methods</b><br>
  Direct, repeated measurements of basal area increase in woody species can be
  made cost-effectively to high levels of accuracy (e.g., Back <i>et al.</i>,
  1997; Brown, 1997; Vine <i>et al.</i>, 1999); these measurements can be combined
  with allometric equations for the species involved (e.g., Burrows <i>et al.</i>,
  2000) to calculate aboveground and below-ground biomass carbon change. Associated
  soil carbon sampling (see <a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a>) can be carried out
  to calculate total system carbon change. The results can be scaled up to regional
  levels by using statistical sampling methods (Austin and Heyligers, 1989) or
  via remote sensing (Danaher <i>et al.</i>, 1998). For areas where woody components
  are not a large part of the carbon fluxes, sampling regimes described in <a href="229.htm">Fact
  Sheet 4.6</a> can be used. </p>
<p>Sampling for charcoal pools is a unique feature related to this activity. The
  slow rate of change of these relatively inert pools create uncertainty about
  whether including this pool is appropriate to the short time frame of the Kyoto
  Protocol. Furthermore, analysis is likely to be expensive. The size of the pool
  and the relatively poorly known dynamics, however, suggest that research is
  needed to determine the significance of this pool under reduced-fire regimes.
</p>
<p><b>Current Knowledge and Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  There is copious documentation of the increase in woody density in savannas
  and other woodlands (e.g., Archer, 1994; Archer <i>et al.</i>, 1995), supported
  by analyses such as soil C<sup>13</sup>/C<sup>12</sup> profiles (e.g., Boutton <i>et al.</i>,
  1998; Burrows <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Management appears to be a more significant
  factor in these changes than environmental factors such as CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, climate, and
  increased nitrogen deposition (Archer <i>et al.</i>, 1995). There is difficulty
  in definitively attributing the proportion of change from each factor, which
  will vary by location. There is significant variation in rates of accumulation
  of woody biomass by location (e.g., 0.25-2.5 t ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for South African savannas)
  (Scholes and van der Merwe, 1996), and differences in potential pool sizes are
  likely. This situation requires some spatial disaggregation to meet uncertainty
  levels specified for reporting. </p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, and Transparency </b><br>
  Monitoring to detect change can be carried out by repeat sampling procedures
  (Back <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Critchley and Poulton, 1998). Detailed guidelines
  for establishing a monitoring network and ensuring its representativeness are
  given by Brown (1997), MacDicken (1997), and Vine <i>et al.</i> (1999). At the
  individual plot level, the combination of allometry plus measured stem growth
  increment (including the use of dendrometers) is a powerful and accurate indicator
  of aboveground biomass flux. A verification and auditing team could evaluate
  satellite imagery to confirm that the integrity of registered sites was maintained,
  and auditing could be undertaken of a subset of these sites. </p>
<p><b>Time Scales </b><br>
  Biomass carbon increases are likely to continue for at least 50 years, though
  at reduced rates with time (Scholes and van der Merwe, 1996; Burrows <i>et al.</i>,
  1998). In some systems, the period of accumulation may be 100 years or longer
  (Archer, 1989). </p>
<p><b>Removals</b><br>
  Burning transfers a large proportion (up to 90 percent) of the aboveground carbon
  and nitrogen pools in some grasslands, and 3 percent of the total nitrogen pool
  to 10 cm in the soil (e.g., Kauffman <i>et al.</i>, 1994), into the atmosphere
  as CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, CO, CH<span class="subscript">4</span>, N<span class="subscript">2</span>O, NO<span class="subscript">X</span>, and particulates. The mix of the gases depends on
  the material burned and the conditions of burning. Burning results in greater
  soil temperature, which increases soil CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fluxes (Knapp <i>et al.</i>, 1998).
  Thus, burning results in a short-term loss of carbon from ecosystems. Replacement
  of this carbon, however, generally occurs within 1 to 3 years for grasslands
  (somewhat longer for woody plants). Where demands for fuel wood or agricultural
  products dictate or where population density is high (e.g., West Africa), increase
  in woody plant density will most likely be kept in check by ongoing management.
</p>
<p>GHG emissions directly from burning (CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, CO, CH<span class="subscript">4</span>, N<span class="subscript">2</span>O, NO<span class="subscript">X</span>) and associated
  grazing activities (CH<span class="subscript">4</span>, N<span class="subscript">2</span>O) cause most productive savannas to be net sources
  of greenhouse emissions (0.06-0.2 t CO<span class="subscript">2</span>-eq ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for semi-arid grasslands
  in Australia; Moore et al., 1997). Elimination of burning along with subsequent
  increases in woody plants and reductions in grazing livestock numbers can cause
  these systems to become net sinks for GHGs (about 1 t CO<span class="subscript">2</span>-eq ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>; Moore
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997). </p>
<p><b>Permanence</b><br>
  In the absence of human intervention, catastrophic fire is the major threat
  to carbon storage in savannas. This situation may be impossible to prevent in
  the long term (50-100 years) (Scholes and van der Merwe, 1996), but because
  this vegetation type evolved under a regular burning regime, recovery after
  fire to the pre-fire structure is usually rapid. Extended droughts can also
  cause mortality (Fensham, 1998). Where mature woody plants die, they are likely
  to be replaced, provided that fire frequency remains low. Dead trees may remain
  standing, undergoing slow decomposition and providing a continuing but decreasing
  carbon store for periods of up to decades. Tree clearing and thinning may occur
  on dense stands to improve agricultural productivity. </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  For much of the world's broad-leaved savannas, as woody plant density increases,
  potential livestock carrying capacity declines (e.g., Scanla, 1992)-as does
  production for other purposes (e.g., Brookman-Amissah <i>et al.</i>, 1980).
  In many ecosystems, fauna and flora species are fire-dependent, so removing
  or reducing fires may result in localized extinction or decline (e.g., Edroma,
  1986). Increasing woody biomass may also reduce environmental services such
  as catchment water yield. Reducing burning will reduce atmospheric loads of
  particulates and various other forms of pollution. </p>
<p><b>Relationship to IPCC Guidelines </b><br>
  The Guidelines deal with savanna burning only in terms of non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> gases; it
  is assumed that there are no net losses of carbon, and the system is assumed
  to be in balance on average. </p>
