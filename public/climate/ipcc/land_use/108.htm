<h4>2.5.2.4. Consistency with Internationally Recognized Criteria and Indicators
  for Sustainable Forest Management and Sustainable Agriculture</h4>
<h5><a name="s2-5-2-4-1"></a>2.5.2.4.1. Sustainable forest management </h5>
<p>Since the UNCED, several intergovernmental efforts have been initiated to develop
  criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management. These efforts include
  the Helsinki Process (covering 39 European countries), the Montreal Process
  (covering 12 non-European countries in the temperate and boreal zones), the
  Tarapoto Process (covering the eight countries in the Amazonian Cooperation
  Treaty), and the International Tropical Timber Organization (covering most forested
  countries in the tropics). In addition, several efforts to establish criteria
  and indicators at the national and subnational levels build on these international
  approaches and adapt them to national and local forest conditions (WCFSD, 1999).
</p>
<p>These and similar (e.g., FAO, 1995a) criteria and indicators are generally
  moving beyond a narrowly defined focus on the productivity of timber and other
  commercial forest products to incorporate ecological and social dimensions of
  sustainability. For example, the broad forest values developed as criteria under
  the Montreal Process for the conservation and sustainable management of boreal
  and temperate forests follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Conservation of biological diversity</li>
  <li>Maintenance of the productive capacity of forest ecosystems</li>
  <li>Maintenance of forest ecosystem health and vitality</li>
  <li>Conservation and maintenance of soil and water resources</li>
  <li>Maintenance of forest contribution to global carbon cycles</li>
  <li>Maintenance and enhancement of long-term multiple socioeconomic benefits
    to meet societal needs</li>
  <li>Effective legal, institutional, and economic framework for forest conservation
    and sustainable management.</li>
</ul>
<p>The development of multiple national and international efforts to develop criteria
  and indicators has led some observers, including the World Commission on Forests
  and Sustainable Development (WCFSD), to propose that some elements of these
  approaches can be usefully harmonized (WCFSD, 1999). The WCFSD further suggests
  that these criteria and indicators should be based on a strategy for sustainable
  forest management that reflects several broadly applicable objectives, including
  the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Indefinitely satisfying needs for timber, fiber, and non-timber forest products</li>
  <li>Ensuring conservation of soil and water </li>
  <li>Sustaining the resilience and renewal capacity of forests</li>
  <li> Supporting food security and livelihood needs of forest-dependent communities
  </li>
  <li>Conserving biological diversity </li>
  <li>Achieving the foregoing goals in a manner that is consistent with the incremental
    productive capacity of forests and requirements for ecological security </li>
  <li>Realizing a more equitable sharing of benefits from uses to which forests
    are put </li>
  <li>Increasing management, cultivation, harvesting, and utilization of minor
    forest products as potential pillars of sustainable forestry to sustain livelihoods
    from dwindling resources </li>
  <li>Securing tenural rights of forest-dependent populations as a means of promoting
    conservation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Parties seeking to implement sustainable forest management in the context of
  LULUCF climate mitigation measures may be able to adapt the criteria and indicators
  developed under one or more of these international processes. It is important
  to recognize, however, that many of these general criteria address national-level
  policy and sustainability and are not intended to directly assess sustainability
  at the forest stand level. Indeed, some objectives will likely prove to be mutually
  contradictory, particularly when they are applied in small ecological units.
  For example, economically viable timber harvesting often may not be reconcilable
  with the conservation of mature forest-dependent biological diversity in the
  same forest tract (<a href="096.htm">Section 2.5.1</a>; Frumhoff, 1995; Bawa
  and Seidler, 1998). </p>
<p>For site-specific projects, Parties might find the criteria and indicators
  that the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) has developed for
  the management of natural forests (CIFOR C&I Team, 1999; Prabhu <i>et al.</i>,
  1999) particularly valuable. The CIFOR criteria and indicators were based on
  research in large-scale natural forests that are managed for commercial timber
  production in Indonesia, Cote d'Ivoire, Brazil, and Cameroon, with additional
  sites in Germany, Austria, and the United States. These criteria and indicators
  provide a useful framework for evaluating policy, environmental, social, and
  production aspects of sustainable forest management and are designed to be readily
  adaptable to local conditions. CIFOR is also planning to develop criteria and
  indicators for tropical plantations and community-managed forests. </p>
<p>One tool for encouraging voluntary application of sustainable forest management
  criteria and indicators to LULUCF projects that have timber or non-timber products
  involves forest product certification. Certification is a process that links
  market demands for sustainably produced forest products with producers who can
  meet those demands. Certification may reward the performance of companies that
  adopt sound forestry practices by enabling them to maintain or improve the marketability
  of wood or other forest products (FAO, 1997a; WCFSD, 1999). Currently, the Forest
  Stewardship Council (FSC) and its accredited certifiers offer one approach to
  product certification. Parties might wish to consider whether and under what
  conditions encouragement of market certification of forest products could strengthen
  the capacity of managed forests to meet carbon mitigation and sustainable development
  goals. </p>
<p>The International Standards Organization (ISO), through its ISO 14000 series,
  also provides a framework for certifying forest management (and other environmental
  management) systems (ISO, 1996). Unlike FSC, the ISO does not identify performance
  standards and does not allow a label to be attached to forest products. Instead,
  ISO 14000 management standards are designed to allow the setting of specific
  environmental and sustainable development criteria for LULUCF projects. Projects
  could then be managed on an ongoing basis to attain those goals, and independent
  auditors could verify whether the management system was consistent with the
  standard. </p>
<p>If Parties wish to implement ISO 14000 management standards for forest or other
  projects under the Kyoto Protocol, they would need to define and periodically
  update the sustainable development guidelines for LULUCF project activities.
  Project participants could then employ the ISO 14000 standards as a means of
  assessing compliance with those guidelines, with independent auditing carried
  out by an existing pool of accredited private-sector agents. This Special Report
  does not analyze the potential cost and time implications of adopting ISO management
  standards for LULUCF projects. </p>
