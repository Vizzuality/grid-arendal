<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.21. Biofuel Produced from Planted Land </h3>
<p>This Fact Sheet details the land-use implications of an expanding role for
  biofuel. </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  Industrial-scale ethanol production exists in Brazil (from sugar cane) and in
  the United States from corn. There is little fuelwood plantation project experience
  from the AIJ phase (see <a href="252.htm#table5-1">Table 5-1</a>). No significant
  electric power supply based on plantation biofuel exists. </p>
<p>This practice's potential depends on success in enlisting and retaining local
  support for biofuel production on land from which communities have drawn their
  livelihood in other ways. Short-rotation forestry, corn, sugar cane, herbaceous
  plants, and grasses have been proposed, but the focus here is forestry. </p>
<p>The biofuel scenarios captured here project a rise in use from around 60 EJ
  (~10 EJ from waste) in 2020 to 300 EJ (~50 EJ from waste) in 2100, with land-use
  implications that depend on plantation productivity (see <a href="207.htm">Section
  4.5.3</a>). Biofuel usage would rise from 10 oven dry tons of wood (~5 t C)
  (~200 GJ) ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> to 25 oven dry tons of wood (~12.5
  t C) (~500 GJ) ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> over a century, leading to land
  usage that would rise from 250 Mha in 2020 to 500Mha in 2100. If these changes
  are realized, the potential fossil fuel offset in ~2040 would be as tabulated
  below. </p>

<p><b>Removal from Atmosphere </b><br>
  Biomass growth absorbs CO<span class="subscript">2</span> that is returned to the atmosphere when it is used
  as biofuel, providing a renewable fuel system that can be based on sustainable
  cultivation practices. Removals from atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> result from substitution
  in the commercial energy system, leaving fossil fuel underground. With traditional
  wood fuel, the removal results from leaving standing natural forests that would
  otherwise be lost.</p>
<p><b>Scientific and Socioeconomic Uncertainties</b><br>
  Technological uncertainties arise in relation to the community-scale application
  of existing and near-term future biofuel conversion processes. The area covered
  by individual plantations, the transportation cost of supply, and the environmental
  and socioeconomic impacts depend on the scale of application technology. Recent
  advances in reduced-scale electricity generation and liquid fuel production
  from gas feedstocks (e.g., gasified biofuel) suggest that community-scaled plantations
  no greater than about 10-km diameter can support cost-effective production of
  commercial energy products (Read, 1999). </p>
<p>Economic uncertainties, for export-led growth based on the production of liquid
  biofuels, relate to future oil price trends, future credits for CO<span class="subscript">2</span> mitigation,
  and possible support for diversifying the liquid fuel resource base, reducing
  strategic dependence on dwindling low-cost oil supplies. </p>
<p>Sociocultural uncertainties arise with regard to sustaining commitment to biofuel-based
  employment and wealth-creating projects that are designed to match the cultural
  traditions and micro-economic interests of the communities concerned. This sustained
  commitment requires major capacity-building to enable sustainable technology
  transfer through country-driven projects that reflect the needs of local communities
  and host country priorities. This capacity-building entails a career structure
  for "Project Champions" qualifying at a rate of ~3000 p.a. in ~200 institutions
  in developing countries (Haque <i>et al.</i>, 1999).</p>
<p><b>Time Scale</b><br>
  Even if the incentives provided by carbon credits and the potential energy productivity
  of suitable land are sufficient to make reversal of deforestation trend driven
  by economic pressures of the past few decades possible, this reversal cannot
  be a short-term process. Rates of policy-driven land-use change that have been
  modeled are broadly in line with that proposed in the Nordwijk Ministerial Declaration
  of 1989.</p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, and Transparency</b><br>
  Where products are commercially traded, market statistics and biofuel conversion
  technology data provide an accurate basis for carbon absorption measurements,
  as with fossil fuel emissions. Where products are used traditionally, "best
  practice" project monitoring procedures and benchmark default estimates would
  be needed.</p>
<p><b>Permanence</b><br>
  Where emissions savings come through retention of existing stocks of carbon
  underground and in natural forest, permanence is no different from emissions
  reduction and forest preservation measures, respectively. With absorption in
  standing plantation timber, permanence depends on perpetuating community involvement
  and the incentives that underpin project initiation. For environmental effectiveness,
  insurance against natural hazards must take the form of additional planting
  on lands in diverse locations.</p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts</b><br>
  Community-scaled plantations can transform lifestyles and fund investments in
  sustainable food systems (e.g., based on agroforestry concepts) in the community.
  Negative socioeconomic and environmental impacts are avoidable through good
  project design. Rural electricity and fuelwood used in modern appliances provide
  rural employment and reduced health risks from smoke inhalation. Environmental
  benefits include cleaner air with sulfur-free liquid fuels; reduced soil degradation,
  water runoff, and downstream siltation; capture of polluting agricultural runoff;
  and utilization of wastes for plantation fertilization, avoiding landfill (Woods
  and Hall, 1994). Famine is caused by poverty, not land shortage (Sen, 1981),
  so carbon credit funding could help raise rural living standards and agricultural
  productivity.</p>
<p><b>Relationship to IPCC Guidelines</b><br>
  The treatment of biofuels in the IPCC Guidelines is discussed in <a href="293.htm">Chapter
  6</a>. </p>
