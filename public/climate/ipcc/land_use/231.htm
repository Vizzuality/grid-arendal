<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.8. Grassland Productivity Improvements </h3>
<p>The productivity of many pastoral lands, particularly in the tropics and arid
  zones, is restricted by nitrogen and other nutrient limitations and the unsuitability
  of some native species to high-intensity grazing. Introduction of nitrogen-fixing
  legumes and high-productivity grasses or additions of fertilizer can increase
  biomass production and soil carbon pools. </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  Native grasses in grasslands, woodland, and shrublands in some regions are sensitive
  to heavy grazing, and growth is often nutrient-limited. Introduction of grass
  and legume species to overcome these limitations has a long history. Such introductions,
  where successful, can significantly increase primary production by up to a factor
  of three or more (Montes and Masco, 1996), thereby increasing soil and biomass
  carbon. Legume and grass introductions increase soil carbon by about 0.08 and
  3.97 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Conant <i>et al.</i>, 2000; <a href="171.htm#table4-4">Tables
  4-4</a> and <a href="177.htm#table4-6">4-6</a>), although the value for grasses
  is significantly higher in a study by Fisher <i>et al.</i> (1997) that introduced
  African grasses to South America. </p>
<p>The area of grassland is variously estimated as 1900-4400 Mha, with a median
  value of 3220 Mha derived from the IGBP-DIS database (Loveland and Belward,
  1997). In developed nations, much of this land may be improved, but in these
  and other regions there is likely to be considerable further potential. For
  example, Fisher <i>et al.</i> (1994) suggest that there may be 35 Mha of suitable
  land in South America that could store 100-507 Mt C yr<sup>-1</sup> by using deep-rooted
  African grasses. This estimate is thought to be too high because of economic
  and management constraints (Fearnside and Barbosa, 1998); carbon storage will
  likely plateau as decomposition rates match increased carbon inputs (Davidson
  <i>et al.</i>, 1994). </p>
<p>Species characteristics such as resistant root material appear to influence
  carbon storage (Urquiaga <i>et al.</i>, 1998). In some environments, productivity
  declines over time because of nitrogen immobilization in the root mass (e.g.,
  Robbins <i>et al.</i>, 1989; Robertson <i>et al.</i>, 1997). Nitrogen can be
  released by soil disturbance, which can also release soil carbon in the short
  term. Wills <i>et al.</i> (1996) suggest that there is potential for the establishment
  of chenopod shrubs over about 6 Mha in New Zealand, with growth of 2-3 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>.
  Similar opportunities exist to grow halophyte shrubs in coastal deserts, inland
  saline soils, or salinized irrigated lands (<a href="173.htm#table4-5">Table
  4-5</a>). </p>
<p>Plant growth on many pastoral lands is limited by lack of nutrients. Additions
  (particularly phosphorus, nitrogen, and sulfur) can result in large growth responses-which
  lead to increases in biomass and soil carbon pools, especially in more mesic
  environments. Normal management practice, however, is to increase the harvesting
  intensity of the additional biomass produced (e.g., Winter et al., 1989), leading
  to potentially little change in carbon stocks. In the absence of grazing, increases
  in aboveground biomass carbon are maximized. In New Zealand, for example, fertilizer
  application to pasture increased total biomass and soil carbon (0-25 cm) by
  7.6 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> in ungrazed grasslands, compared with 6.3 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> in grazed pasture
  (McIntosh <i>et al.</i>, 1997). Even with grazing, fertilizer application in
  the semi-arid tropics increased aboveground grass biomass from 0.88 to about
  3 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> (Cameron and Ross, 1996). In prairie vegetation, nitrogen fertilization
  (0.224 t N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) over 40 years resulted in an increase of about 22 t SOC
  ha<sup>-1</sup> compared with unfertilized plots (Schwab <i>et al.</i>, 1990). </p>
<p>Addition of superphosphate to phosphate-poor soil in conjunction with planting
  of legumes has been shown to more than double soil organic matter levels (Williams
  and Donald, 1957; Russell, 1960; Barrow, 1969). Dalal and Carter (1999) suggest
  that phosphorus and sulfur fertilization over 56 Mha of northern Australia could
  increase carbon sequestration by 28 Mt C yr<sup>-1</sup> (280 Mt C over 10 years). Haynes
  and Williams (1992) reported that SOC (0-4 cm) levels of 37-year-old grazed
  pastures that received 0, 188, and 376 kg of superphosphate per year were greater
  than or equal to SOC levels at their "wilderness" site. </p>
<p><b>Curent Knowledge and Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  The basic processes that change carbon stocks under this activity are well understood.
  The extent of the potential area for this activity and the proportion of potential
  carbon storage benefits that will result are uncertain. Rates of increase of
  soil carbon are generally higher in more mesic environments than in drier ones
  (<a href="171.htm#table4-4">Table 4-4</a>); these rates vary between ecosystems,
  with woodlands and native grasslands exhibiting the greatest increases (Conant
  et al., 2000). Background environmental changes such as climate variability,
  climate change, and atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> increases may impact on carbon stocks. </p>
<p><b>Methods</b> <br>
  Where direct sampling is used, soil carbon pools must be measured throughout
  the profile down to at least 1 m because of deep carbon storage with some species.
  In at least some environments, surface soil carbon is correlated with pasture
  condition (Ash <i>et al.</i>, 1996), which could be assessed as described in
  <a href="229.htm">Fact Sheet 4.6</a>. There is some capacity to model carbon
  changes, if information about climate, soils, species characteristics, fertilizer
  applications, and livestock usage is sufficiently well known. </p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, and Transparency </b><br>
  Techniques for repeat direct sampling exist for the biomass and soil components
  (<a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a>). There may be opportunities to develop approaches
  to scale up these results by using the approaches that are briefly described
  in <a href="229.htm">Fact Sheet 4.6</a>. Agricultural statistics on areas of
  improved pastures and fertilizer use and associated information on livestock
  density and characteristics may be needed to make evaluations of likely impacts
  on system carbon stores. </p>
<p><b>Time Scales </b><br>
  Soil carbon can continue to accumulate for periods of greater than 40 years
  (Conant <i>et al.</i>, 2000). For example, linear increases in soil carbon over
  40- to 50-year periods have been recorded (e.g., Russell, 1960). Carbon accumulation
  will plateau at some point, however, and this time is likely to vary substantially
  between systems and with specific activities. </p>
<p><b>Removal</b><br>
  Biomass is removed by livestock and other herbivores, by fire, and through detachment
  and decomposition. Soil carbon is removed mainly by decomposition and erosion.
  Both processes are strongly influenced by management. </p>
<p><b>Permanence</b><br>
  Cessation of these practices will tend to result in restrictions of further
  carbon storage. Soil carbon is likely to have varying residence times, extending
  to millennia. Biomass carbon is vulnerable to disturbance but will recover rapidly
  in most circumstances, and mean levels of carbon are likely to be higher than
  in the absence of the activity given suitable grazing regimes. </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  Increased agricultural productivity is likely, as is some loss of biodiversity
  from native grass ecosystems. Increased legume components are likely to increase
  acidification rates in tropical (Noble <i>et al.</i>, 1997) and temperate (Helyar
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997) pastures, through increased leaching of nitrate and increased
  productivity. Productivity may fall if pH is lowered too far. Scanning accessions
  for lower rates of acid excretion may lead to introduction of new varieties
  that impose less acidification risk (Tang <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Optimization
  of fertilizer application rates can reduce these risks and reduce off-site impacts
  from nutrient leaching and pollution of waterways and groundwater. </p>
<p>Increases in legumes may result in more nitrous oxide emissions than from native
  grass pastures (Veldkamp et al., 1998). Increased digestibility and protein
  content of improved pastures, however, may reduce livestock methane emissions
  substantially (Kurihara <i>et al.</i>, 1999). The radiative forcing of methane
  emissions is about an order of magnitude larger than that of nitrous oxide emissions
  from tropical grasslands (Howden <i>et al.</i>, 1994). Addition of nitrogenous
  fertilizer is associated with nitrous oxide emissions. These emissions and methane
  emissions from livestock are accounted under the current IPCC Guidelines. </p>
<p><b>Relationship to IPCC Guidelines </b><br>
  The Reference Manual includes procedures for estimating changes in soil carbon
  stocks associated with pasture management as it affects productivity. Individual
  practices (e.g., species replacement, fertilization), however, are not dealt
  with, and general default values are provided in the Workbook only for improved,
  unimproved, and degraded pasture soils. </p>
