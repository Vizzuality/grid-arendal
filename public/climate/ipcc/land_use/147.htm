<h4>3.5.2.5. Landscape-Level Results </h4>
<p>The numerical values selected for all aspects of carbon dynamics in the hypothetical
  landscape are comparable to those of a temperate ecosystem. The actual values
  are not important here, nor are the absolute numerical values of the results.
  The purpose of these examples is to demonstrate qualitatively how, for each
  definitional scenario, the reported carbon stock changes in the ARD land portion
  of the landscape compare to the actual carbon stock changes in the simulated
  landscape. Although the simulations extend over several commitment periods,
  for clarity only the results of the first commitment period are reported here.
</p>
<p>The area of ARD land in each commitment period is a function of the human activities
  simulated in each of the nine cases, as well as the definitional scenarios that
  specify which activities create ARD land (see <a href="144.htm#table3-10">Table
  3-10</a>). In all cases, the area of ARD land in the first commitment period
  is much less than the total area in the landscape. For cases A through F, no
  ARD land is created for the definitional scenarios that require a forest change
  (<a href="#figure3-5">Figure 3-5</a>). For these scenarios, only cases G, H,
  and I (i.e., those with a true forest/non-forest change) create ARD land at
  the end of the first commitment period. The Degradation/ Aggradation definitional
  scenario also reports ARD land for cases E and F, in which the potential forest
  cover at maturity is changed for some areas. </p>

<p>The definitional scenarios in which a harvest/regeneration cycle creates ARD
  land (i.e., FAO and Land Cover) report large areas of ARD land. In case A, the
  area of ARD land is 23 kha for both the FAO and the Land Cover scenarios. In
  case B, the area naturally regenerated in the FAO scenario does not create ARD
  land. In cases H and I, the afforested area is not included in the Land Cover
  scenario because the planted areas have not grown past the forest cover threshold
  at the end of the first commitment period. In case I, all deforested and afforested
  area contributes 9.2 kha of ARD land at the end of the first commitment period-except
  in the Land Cover scenario, in which the afforested area again has not yet grown
  past the forest cover threshold. </p>
<p><a href="fig3-6.htm">Figure 3-6</a> summarizes the results for the nine cases 
  defined in <a href="144.htm#table3-10">Table 3-10</a> for the first commitment

  including soil carbon; and total ecosystem carbon, which is the sum of aboveground 
  and below-ground biomass and dead organic matter. Below-ground biomass is not 
  shown separately because it is proportional to aboveground biomass. All carbon 
  stock changes are reported in kilo tons over the 5-year commitment period. The 
  actual stock change is that observed in the hypothetical landscape. </p>

<p>In most combinations of definitional scenarios and simulated cases, <a href="fig3-6.htm">Figure 
  3-6</a> shows large discrepancies between the actual carbon stock change in 
  the landscape and that reported for the ARD land. In cases A and B, the actual 
  carbon stock change in the landscape is zero. The scenarios that limit the creation 
  of ARD land to only forest change activities report no ARD land, therefore no 
  carbon stock changes for cases A-F. These definitional scenarios fail to account 
  for increases (case D) or decreases (case C) in actual carbon stocks resulting 
  from accelerated or decelerated harvesting rates and from changes in forest 
  productivity (cases E and F). These scenarios do capture the land-use change 
  activities of cases G, H, and I and represent the correct carbon stock increase 
  in case H, as well as the decrease in cases G and I. </p>
<p>Definitional scenarios in which the harvest/regeneration cycle creates ARD
  land (FAO, Land Cover) report a large decrease in carbon stock in the ARD land,
  except with an activity-based accounting approach in the FAO scenario. In cases
  in which the actual landscape carbon stock increases (cases D, F, and H) or
  decreases (cases C, E, G, and I), the reported stock change becomes somewhat
  larger or smaller relative to case A, respectively. Despite these small differences
  between cases, the reported change is always negative, even if the actual carbon
  stock increases in the landscape (e.g., cases D and F). </p>
<p>The choice between the three carbon accounting approaches (land-based I and
  II and activity-based) for the FAO definitional scenario does not affect the
  area of ARD land. The approaches do report different carbon stock changes for
  the ARD land, however. The stock change in land-based approach I is reported
  for the 5-year commitment period. For land-based approach II, the stock change
  on the land is reported from the time of the activity to the end of the commitment
  period. In the activity-based approach, stock changes that do not result from
  the reforestation activity but happen on the land after reforestation has taken
  place are excluded from the accounting. </p>
<p>The impacts of the three accounting approaches differ between carbon pools. 
  For aboveground biomass, the FAO definitional scenario with land-based approach 
  I (FAO opt 1 in <a href="fig3-6.htm">Figure 3-6</a>) always yields a large negative 
  carbon stock change because this option indirectly accounts for harvesting during 
  the commitment period. Land-based approach II (FAO opt 2) reports a small positive 
  carbon stock change in aboveground biomass, resulting from the growth of reforested 
  seedlings. This increase in aboveground biomass is more than offset by decreases 
  in dead organic matter carbon stocks. Land-based approach II does not account 
  for the increase in dead organic matter from the input of logging slash and 
  root biomass during harvest. It does account for the decay of all dead organic 
  matter from the reforestation activity to the end of the commitment period. 
  Thus, land-based approach II reports a large negative carbon stock change for 
  the dead organic matter pools. Total ecosystem carbon stock change under land-based 
  approach II is negative-albeit only about one-third of the values reported for 
  land-based approach I. The results for the activity-based approach are the same 
  as for land-based approach II, except that the negative stock change from decaying 
  slash between reforestation and 2012 is excluded from the accounting because 
  it does not result from the reforestation activity. Therefore, the FAO scenario 
  with activity-based accounting results in carbon credits in the first commitment 
  period; that is, only the aboveground biomass increase under FAO (option 2) 
  would be reported. </p>
<p>The definitional scenario that is designed to capture degrading or aggrading
  carbon stocks (the Degradation/Aggradation scenario) correctly reports no change
  in carbon stocks in cases A and B. By design, it does not capture carbon stock
  changes associated with altered harvest rates (cases C and D) because they do
  not change the potential cover of carbon density at maturity. This scenario
  fails to accurately report the actual carbon stock changes in cases E and F,
  which represent degrading and aggrading forest conditions. As before, the changes
  at the landscape level are different from those reported for the ARD land. Moreover,
  even when the carbon stock at the landscape level is increasing (case F), the
  reported carbon stock change is still negative. </p>
<p>The decision about which pools to include will also affect the differences 
  between the actual carbon stock changes in the landscape and those reported 
  for the ARD land. For aboveground biomass, below-ground biomass (not shown), 
  and total ecosystem carbon, the differences are in the same direction but of 
  different magnitude (<a href="fig3-6.htm">Figure 3-6</a>). The differences can 
  be of opposite direction for the dead organic matter pool alone, but it is not 
  likely that carbon stock changes for only this pool will be reported. For definitional 
  scenarios in which the harvest/regeneration cycle creates ARD land, the dead 
  organic matter pool can increase when biomass pools are decreasing because logging 
  slash-including stumps and root biomass-is added to the dead organic matter 
  pool following harvesting. </p>
<p>We have conducted additional simulation experiments as sensitivity analyses.
  We systematically altered the rates of land-use change and harvest to cause
  landscape-level carbon stocks to either increase, remain approximately unchanged,
  or decrease. It can be demonstrated that combining one rate of land-use change
  with three different rates of harvesting, or vice versa, creates very different
  reported carbon stock changes for the three groups of definitional scenarios.
</p>
<p>We drew the following conclusions from the analyses of the simulations: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The area of ARD land in the first commitment period is much less than the
    total area in the landscape. The area is greater in definitional scenarios
    in which forest harvesting creates ARD land. </li>
  <li>Definitional scenarios that limit ARD land to areas with forest/non-forest
    change and scenarios in which the harvest/regeneration cycle does not create
    ARD land (IPCC, Land Use, Flexible, and Biome) report very similar amounts
    of carbon stock changes for the same amount of deforestation. These definitional
    scenarios are insensitive, however, to actual changes in the landscape-level
    carbon stock. Thus, although the same carbon stock change is reported for
    the ARD land area, the actual carbon stock change in the landscape could be
    positive, unchanged, or negative. </li>
  <li> Definitional scenarios in which a harvest/regeneration cycle creates ARD
    land (FAO and Land Cover) report changes in the ARD land in the early commitment
    periods that are much more negative than the actual changes in the landscape
    because regrowth on lands harvested prior to 1990 is not counted. This conclusion
    holds for land-based accounting approaches I and II but not for the activity-based
    approach: In some cases the activity-based approach does report an increase
    in aboveground biomass even if the actual carbon stock change is zero or negative.
    In the FAO and Land Cover scenarios, the rates of harvest and deforestation
    affect the reported carbon stock change. Thus, with the same deforestation
    rate, the reported change in carbon stocks becomes more negative with increasing
    harvest rate. </li>
  <li> If the intent is to report carbon stock changes that are similar to the
    actual carbon stock changes in a landscape, only full carbon accounting can
    achieve this objective. If the intent is to best account for carbon stock
    changes in the ARD land area, a definitional scenario that only includes forest/non-forest
    transitions is best suited. </li>
  <li> Differences between actual and reported carbon stock changes can be reduced
    further if forest management activities that alter landscape-level carbon
    stock are included using the mechanisms defined in Article 3.4. </li>
