<h3>4.3.3. Land-Based versus Practice-Based Accounting</h3>
<p>The choice of accounting approaches will be important in establishing the difficulty
  in implementing additional activities under Article 3.4 (see <a href="048.htm">Section
  2.3.2.2</a> for a discussion of these accounting issues and <a href="126.htm">Section
  3.3.2</a> for a discussion of various measurement methods as they apply to Article
  3.3 activities). If the Parties decide on land-based measurement for activities
  under Articles 3.3 and 3.4 and the affected Parties are successful in identifying
  and tracking individual land parcels in a land-based system, some additional
  cost and difficulty would result from the extra parcels of land that would need
  to be tracked, measured, and recorded as a result of additional Article 3.4
  activities. This increased cost and difficulty may not pose a significant challenge
  if a Party's reporting is based solely on project activities. If the Party wishes
  to report on the implications of a policy or program with national impacts,
  however, the technical and operational difficulties may become significant.
  The additional demand for field monitoring resources would essentially scale
  linearly with the number of separate land areas involved. The incremental effort
  may be small, however, relative to the large investment of effort needed for
  the initial establishment of a system for Article 3.3, unless the sheer number
  of land areas overwhelms the system's capability. </p>
<p>If a land-based approach were chosen, the demand on a Party's measurement and
  accounting system created by the additional activities selected under Article
  3.4 would be significantly affected by the manner in which those activities
  were defined. Under the broad definition, the monitored land areas might be
  large regions of similar land use where periodic measurements based on statistical
  sampling methods were used to document changes in stock over the whole area.
  <br>
  If the narrow definition of activities is utilized-and a fairly lengthy list
  adopted-maintaining a spatially explicit database on each land area where activities
  were implemented may be beyond the capacity of any existing national environmental
  inventory system, so the Parties may wish to consider options that do not require
  spatially explicit recordkeeping. In selecting among these options, the major
  issues are likely to be cost and feasibility (<a href="#figure4-7">Figure 4-7</a>).
  Although all options are technically feasible, they vary widely in their degree
  of difficulty. Where Parties have strong institutions of private land ownership
  and management responsibility, establishing a system in which land owners and
  managers carry out the basic measurements and annual monitoring, with verification
  by a third party or government, may be feasible. (The issues of accounting methods
  discussed in <a href="038.htm">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="112.htm">3</a> would
  be encountered in a similar manner with activities under Article 3.4.) </p>

<p>The impact of these policy choices on monitoring and reporting effort may or
  may not be significantly affected by selection of a short rather than long list
  of activities under Option A, if a broad activity definition is adopted. In
  instances in which a national inventory system is established and the entire
  land surface is periodically monitored, the addition of further activities would
  represent no additional effort. If a narrow definition of activity were adopted,
  the effort would essentially scale up with the number of land areas affected
  by that activity, and by the number of different activities in the list. The
  effort would continue to rise, even once the entire land surface of an area
  was under observation. </p>
<p>One effect of selecting Option B associated with a flexible approach to definitions
  would be to encourage research and development of new and more efficient methods
  of measurement, monitoring, and verification. The Parties might choose to make
  an initial decision that allows for a broad approach during a testing period,
  with a second review period to take place at a specified future date, as a means
  of encouraging innovation while protecting against the permanent establishment
  of methods that might later be regarded as inappropriate. </p>
