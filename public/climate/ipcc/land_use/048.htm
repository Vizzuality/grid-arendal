<h4>2.2.3.2. Reforestation</h4>
<p>Reforestation refers to "the establishment of trees on land that has been cleared
  of forest within the relatively recent past." Operational forestry definitions
  of reforestation often include the establishment of trees on land that has just
  been harvested. With such a definition, areas subject to conventional forest
  harvesting and regeneration cycles would come within the domain of Article 3.3
  of the Protocol at their first post-1990 harvest and regeneration cycle. This
  definition could have major implications for the size of the land base included
  as lands under Article 3.3 (see <a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a>). </p>
<p>In some definitions, reforestation is the conversion of land use back to forest
  after a period of some other land use. The IPCC Guidelines, which were developed
  explicitly for carbon inventory, used such a definition of reforestation: "the
  planting of forests on lands which have, historically, previously contained
  forests but which have been converted to some other use." </p>
<p>Most of the definitions for reforestation collected by Lund (1999) arise from
  this forestry perspective and appear to include regeneration after harvesting.
  Some are very explicit: "Reforestation areas are temporarily unstocked areas
  caused by harvesting, wind breaks, natural disasters and so on. These areas
  have to be reforested artificially (usually within 3 years, under certain circumstances
  within maximal 8 years) or with methods of natural regeneration (usually within
  8 years, under certain circumstances within maximal 11 years). In Austria, reforestation
  has always been recognized as a part of forest management and has never been
  linked to land-use change." </p>
<p>Such definitions of reforestation do not involve transition from a non-forest
  to forest state (unless, for example, a strict canopy-cover definition of forest
  is used). Instead, these definitions are activity-based; they do not reflect
  a change of land-use designation. This factor raises several options for combinations
  of definitions based on land use, land cover, and activities that are considered
  in the definitional scenarios of <a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a>. </p>
<p>One must consider the different types of reestablishment methods. Decision
  9/CP.4 includes the phrase "direct human-induced activities of afforestation,
  reforestation, and deforestation." Some definitions of reforestation restrict
  the activity to the planting of trees (e.g., the IPCC definition) or the "artificial
  establishment" of trees (see <a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a>), which could be
  taken to exclude methods based on more natural regeneration. Most forest regeneration
  is carried out through "natural" reestablishment from seed remaining on the
  site or from retained seed-trees. Sometimes the seed-bed is prepared by mechanical
  or chemical treatment. Only a small percentage of forest area is reestablished
  by direct planting. If the definition is broadly encompassing with regard to
  regeneration methods, other questions still arise. For example, should land-use
  practices that lead to an increase in woody cover (e.g., invasion by woody weeds)
  be counted as reforestation? <a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a> deals with some
  aspects of this issue; <a href="157.htm">Chapter 4</a> (<a href="177.htm">Section
  4.4.3</a>) takes up other aspects. </p>
