<h3>1.4.2. Land-Use Management </h3>
<p>Management of forests, croplands, and rangelands affects sources and sinks
  of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, CH<span class="subscript">4</span>, and N<span class="subscript">2</span>O. On land managed for forestry, harvesting of crops and
  timber changes land cover and carbon stocks in the short term while maintaining
  continued land use. Moreover, most agricultural management practices affect
  soil condition. A forest that is managed in a wholly sustainable manner will
  encompass stands, patches, or compartments comprising all stages from regeneration
  through harvest, including areas disturbed by natural events and management
  operations. Overall, a forest comprising all stages in the stand life cycle
  operates as a functional system that removes carbon from the atmosphere, utilizing
  carbon in the stand cycle and exporting carbon as forest products. Forests of
  such characteristics, if well managed, assure rural development through working
  opportunities at the beginning and establishment of forest industries in later
  stages of the development process. In addition, such forests provide other benefits,
  such as biodiversity, nature conservation, recreation, and amenities for local
  communities. For historical and economic reasons, however, many forests today
  depart from this ideal and are fragmented or have strongly skewed stand age
  distribution that influences their carbon sequestration capability. </p>
<p>Forest soils present opportunities to conserve or sequester carbon (Johnson,
  1992; Lugo and Brown, 1993; Dixon <i>et al.</i>, 1994a). Several long-term experiments
  demonstrate that carbon can accrete in the soil at rates of 0.5 to 2.0 t ha<sup>-1</sup>
  yr<sup>-1</sup> (Dixon et al., 1994b). Management practices to maintain, restore, and enlarge
  forest soil carbon pools include fertilizer use; concentration of agriculture
  and reduction of slash-and-burn practices; preservation of wetlands, peatlands,
  and old-growth forest; forestation of degraded and nondegraded sites, marginal
  agricultural lands, and lands subject to severe erosion; minimization of site
  disturbance during harvest operations to retain organic matter; retention of
  forest litter and debris after silvicultural activities; and any practice that
  reduces soil aeration, heating, and drying (Johnson, 1992). </p>
<p>Cropland soils can lose carbon as a consequence of soil disturbance (e.g.,
  tillage). Tillage increases aeration and soil temperatures (Tisdall and Oades,
  1982; Elliott, 1986), making soil aggregates more susceptible to breakdown and
  physically protected organic material more available for decomposition (Elliott,
  1986; Beare et al., 1994). In addition, erosion can significantly affect soil
  carbon stocks through the removal or deposition of soil particles and associated
  organic matter. Erosion and redistribution of soil may not result in a net loss
  of carbon at the landscape level because carbon may be redeposited on the landscape
  instead of being released to the atmosphere (van Noordwijk <i>et al</i>., 1997;
  Lal et al., 1998; Stallard, 1998). Although some the displaced organic matter
  may be redeposited and buried on the landscape, in general the productivity
  of the soil that is eroded-and its inherent ability to support carbon fixation
  and storage-is reduced. Losses through leaching of soluble organic carbon occur
  in many soils; although this leaching is seldom a dominant carbon flux in soils,
  it is a contributor to the transport of carbon from the terrestrial environment
  to the marine environment via runoff (Meybeck, 1982; Sarmiento and Sundquist,
  1992; cf. runoff in <a href="019.htm#figure1-1">Figure 1-1</a>). Soil carbon
  content can be protected and even increased through alteration of tillage practices,
  crop rotations, residue management, reduction of soil erosion, improvement of
  irrigation and nutrient management, and other changes in forestland and cropland
  management (Kern and Johnson, 1993; Lee et al., 1993; Cole et al., 1996). </p>
<p>Livestock grazing on grasslands, converted cropland, savannas, and permanent
  pastures is the largest areal extent of land use (FAO, 1993). Grazing alters
  ground cover and can lead to soil compaction and erosion, as well as alteration
  of nutrient cycles and runoff. Soil carbon, in turn, is affected by these changes.
  Avoiding overgrazing can reduce these effects. </p>
<p>Croplands and pastures are the dominant anthropogenic source of CH<span class="subscript">4</span> (<a href="022.htm">Section
  1.2.2</a>) and N<span class="subscript">2</span>O (<a href="023.htm">Section 1.2.3</a>), although estimates
  of the CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and N<span class="subscript">2</span>O budgets remain uncertain (Melillo et al., 1996). Rice cultivation
  and livestock (enteric fermentation) have been estimated to be the two primary
  sources of CH<span class="subscript">4</span>. The primary sources of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O are denitrification and nitrification
  processes in soils. Emissions of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O are estimated to have increased significantly
  as a result of changes in fertilizer use and animal waste (Kroeze <i>et al</i>.,
  1999). Alteration of rice cultivation practices, livestock feed, and fertilizer
  use are potential management practices that could reduce CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and N<span class="subscript">2</span>O sources.
</p>
<p>Ecosystem conservation may also influence carbon sinks. Many forests, savannas,
  and wetlands, if managed as nature reserves or/and recreation areas, can preserve
  significant stocks of carbon, although these stocks might be affected negatively
  by climate change. Some wetlands and old-growth forests exhibit particularly
  high carbon densities; other semi-natural ecosystems (e.g., savannas) may conserve
  carbon simply because of their large areal extent. </p>
