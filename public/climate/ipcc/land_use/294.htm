<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Under Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol (see <a href="#box6-1">Box 6-1</a>),
  the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Guidelines)
  provide the basis for estimating and reporting anthropogenic emissions by sources
  and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs). </p>

    <td>Methodologies for estimating anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals
      by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol
      shall be those accepted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
      and agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties at its third session. Where
      such methodologies are not used, appropriate adjustments shall be applied
      according to methodologies agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties
      serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Protocol at its first session.
      Based on the work of, inter alia, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
      Change and advice provided by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological
      Advice, the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties
      to this Protocol shall regularly review and, as appropriate, revise such
      methodologies and adjustments, taking fully into account any relevant decisions
      by the Conference of the Parties. Any revision to methodologies or adjustments
      shall be used only for the purposes of ascertaining compliance with commitments
      under Article 3 in respect of any commitment period adopted subsequent to
      that revision.</td>

<p>Annex A of the Protocol lists all sectors from the Guidelines that may be used
  to meet commitments (Article 3.1), with the exception of land-use change and
  forestry (LUCF). The LUCF sector is excluded from Annex A because the accounting
  rules for this sector are yet to be defined by Parties. However, Article 3 refers
  to the potential use of agricultural soils and LUCF. </p>
<p>The Guidelines were developed to report national greenhouse gas inventories
  under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), not
  the Protocol. Depending on decisions made by Parties, it is likely that improvements
  to the Guidelines will be needed to estimate and report GHGs, stock changes,
  and associated activities. This chapter suggests options for improving the Guidelines
  in relation to the verifiability and transparency of reported data. </p>
<p>The IPCC Guidelines consist of three volumes: the Reference Manual, the Workbook,
  and the Reporting Instructions. To analyze their adequacy for reporting under
  the Protocol, there is a need to distinguish between them. The desired principles
  of these inventory guidelines include completeness, comparability, transparency,
  and accuracy. The UNFCCC has developed reporting guidelines for National Communications
  of Annex I Parties, which are based on the IPCC Guidelines. </p>
<p>The Workbook contributes to comparability and transparency by virtue of a common,
  simplified approach. It is also helpful when there are limitations of expertise
  and data. To improve accuracy, however, country-specific data and more elaborate
  methods, such as those described in the Reference Manual, may be required. The
  Workbook encourages the use of national data but provides default data because
  the methods were designed for use by all Parties. The use of national data is
  likely to increase the accuracy of estimates of emissions and removals of GHGs,
  changes in carbon stocks, and their associated activities. This increased accuracy
  could be important for compliance under the Protocol. </p>
<p>The Reference Manual provides a comprehensive approach to carbon accounting
  (by covering all of the main land-use change and forestry activities). The Reference
  Manual mentions all pools and encourages countries to undertake comprehensive
  accounting of carbon pools affected by anthropogenic activities in relation
  to LUCF. The Guidelines do not differentiate, however, between direct human-induced
  activities and indirect human activities (e.g., atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fertilization
  or nutrient deposition). </p>
<p>With the Reference Manual, it is feasible to estimate national changes in aboveground
  and below-ground biomass, soil, soil surface litter, and harvested wood products
  for all forests, shrublands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. For countries
  in which the change in stocks of forest products is significant, the Reference
  Manual recommends that the products pool be reported. </p>
<p>The underlying principles of national accounting for GHG emissions and removals
  in the Reference Manual are the same as those applied in the Workbook. The Workbook
  contains accounting methods and default data for a subset of carbon pools, such
  as aboveground biomass and carbon in the top 0.3 m of the soil. The Workbook
  does not give explicit methods for other pools, including below-ground biomass,
  harvested wood products, or deep soil carbon. For the treatment of wood products,
  the Workbook assumes that the stock of forest products is not increasing significantly
  in most countries. Hence, carbon accounting for wood products is not required,
  although the amount of wood harvested for biofuels is necessary for countries
  to estimate non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> gases from combustion and report these emissions in the
  energy sector. The accounting methods in the Workbook may need to be improved
  to directly link changes in soil carbon and other pools with the activities
  that cause these changes. </p>
<p>The Reporting Instructions provide a range of definitions for anthropogenic
  activities, a glossary of terms, and tables to report anthropogenic emissions
  and removals of GHGs. These tables are flexible enough to allow for reporting
  of all carbon pools, even if the accounting methods and default data are not
  provided by the Guidelines. This flexibility in reporting contributes to inventory
  completeness, though not necessarily comparability. </p>
<p>Under the Protocol, if emissions and removals of GHGs resulting from land use,
  land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) are to assist Annex B Parties in meeting
  their commitments, the Guidelines must provide a basis for transparent and verifiable
  reporting. In addition, there are other potential requirements: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Reporting of changes in carbon stocks resulting from afforestation, reforestation,
    and deforestation (ARD) activities separately (Article 3.3)</li>
  <li>Reporting of changes in carbon stocks and emissions and removals of GHGs
    resulting from additional human-induced activities, yet to be decided by the
    Parties (e.g., Article 3.4)</li>
  <li>Reporting of net GHG emissions and removals associated with LULUCF projects
    (e.g., Article 6).</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the issues discussed in this chapter are not unique to the LUCF sector,
  including uncertainties, transparency, and verifiability. Generally, the level
  of uncertainty may be inherently higher for all GHG emissions associated with
  biological systems than the level of uncertainty for emissions associated with
  energy and industrial systems. These uncertainties can be reduced, however,
  through scientific and technological developments, as well as improvements in
  data collection and analysis. Parties would need to consider the tradeoffs between
  improved accuracy of data, transparency, verifiability, and costs. An underlying
  principle of the Guidelines, however, is the consistent treatment and reporting
  of uncertainties of GHGs among all sectors. </p>
