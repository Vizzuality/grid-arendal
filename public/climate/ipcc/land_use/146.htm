<h4>3.5.2.3. Scenarios in Which Forest Degradation or Aggradation Create ARD Land</h4>
<p>Only in the Degradation/Aggradation definitional scenario is ARD land created
  when human activities aggrade or degrade forests (i.e., they change the potential
  carbon stock at maturity). In this scenario, human activities that result in
  land-use change also create ARD land. Forest harvesting followed by planting
  does not create ARD land if it does not alter the potential carbon stock at
  maturity. </p>
<h4><a name="s3-5-2-4"></a>3.5.2.4. Land- and Activity-Based Carbon Accounting
  Rules</h4>
<p><a href="126.htm">Section 3.3.2</a> introduces three possible approaches to
  carbon accounting: </p>
<ol>
  <li>A land-based approach in which an activity creates ARD land and the carbon
    stock change on that land is reported for the entire commitment period (land-based
    approach I).</li>
  <li>A land-based approach in which an activity creates ARD land and, if the
    activity occurred during the commitment period, the carbon stock change on
    that land is reported from the start of the activity to the end of the commitment
    period (land-based approach II).</li>
  <li>An activity-based approach in which each activity is assigned a carbon stock
    change, and the reported carbon stock change of a landscape is calculated
    as the area of each activity times the stock change assigned to each activity.
    Only stock changes resulting from an ARD activity are accounted. There can
    be carbon stock changes on ARD land that do not result from an ARD activity
    and therefore are not accounted. This approach introduces a series of complications-such
    as multiple activities on the same land area, verification of ARD land area,
    verification of carbon stock changes, and so forth. This approach could be
    implemented without reference to a specific land area, but such implementation
    would aggravate such complications. </li>
</ol>
<p>For the landscape-level analyses, we apply the carbon accounting rules of the
  three foregoing options to the FAO definitional scenario in which reforestation
  (and not harvest) creates ARD land. The difference between the three accounting
  rules becomes obvious when reforestation follows harvest during the commitment
  period. Under option 1, the carbon stock change from the start to the end of
  the commitment period is reported, thereby including the stock change effect
  of harvesting even though the subsequent reforestation creates ARD land. Under
  option 2, the carbon stock change from reforestation to the end of the commitment
  period is reported, including the loss of post-harvest slash. This reporting
  period includes less than the five-year commitment period. Under option 3, the
  carbon stock change is also reported from the reforestation to the end of the
  commitment period, but the carbon release from harvest slash and dead roots
  is not accounted because this loss does not result from the reforestation activity.
  This carbon accounting approach is approximated here by estimates of aboveground
  biomass changes obtained from option 2 and by ignoring all changes in soil and
  dead organic matter pools. </p>
<p>To conduct the quantitative analyses with the hypothetical landscape, we developed
  an analytical framework that employs a very simple model of ecosystem carbon
  dynamics and applies the definitions and accounting rules of the seven scenarios.
  The ecosystem model is driven by three curves that describe the aboveground
  biomass dynamics as a function of age for the high- and low-productivity forests
  and the agricultural land (<a href="#figure3-4">Figure 3-4</a>). These curves
  are applied to a landscape that contains 1,500 parcels of 100 ha each. Note
  that in the model, the agricultural land contains 5 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> in aboveground
  biomass. A set of companion curves defines canopy cover as a function of stand
  age for the two forest types. </p>

	  in the model as a function of age for productive and degraded forest
	  and for agricultural land.</i>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>In the model, below-ground (i.e., living root) biomass is calculated as a proportion
  of aboveground biomass. Each year a proportion of the aboveground and below-ground
  biomass is transferred to a single dead organic matter and soil carbon pool.
  Carbon is released from this pool through decomposition. Harvest transfers carbon
  from biomass to the dead organic matter pool and to a pool of harvested material
  (which is not included in this model). The model accounts for annual growth
  and decomposition and for changes in cover type and land use associated with
  human activities. </p>
