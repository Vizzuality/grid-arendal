<h3>3.4.3. Changes in Carbon Stock (per Unit of Area) </h3>
<p>To assess carbon stock changes on lands in which ARD activities have taken
  place, it is necessary to either spatially delineate the land over which ARD
  activities have occurred and assess the stock changes therein or use a system
  of remeasured sample plots including the same areas. </p>
<p>The language of decision 9/CP.4 (FCCC, 1998b) implies that carbon stocks need
  to be measured only in 2008 and 2012 for Article 3.3 adjustments in the first
  commitment period. In Article 3.4, a stock assessment in 1990 is specifically
  called for. Incorporation of a D-R Rule (see <a href="129.htm">Section 3.3.2.3</a>),
  however, would require an additional carbon stock assessment at a specific year
  prior to 2008 to estimate the carbon stock at the specific time a parcel of
  land becomes part of the ARD land. Without such a rule, incentives exist for
  deforestation followed by reforestation after 1990; with the rule, a carbon
  stock assessment is required for a point in time prior to the deforestation
  (e.g., 1990). </p>
<p>Absent this rule, an assessment for Article 3.3 (under the land-based I approach)
  would entail accounting for ARD land at 2008 and 2012. If the measurements do
  not coincide with the endpoints of the commitment period, however, interpolation
  may be required. </p>
<p><a href="079.htm">Section 2.4.2</a> describes the data requirements for assessment
  of the carbon stock of a forest. The choice of scenario will not change the
  data necessary for carbon stock assessments. A carbon stock-based definition
  of forest implies, however, that a carbon stock assessment is required to determine
  whether an ARD activity has taken place; other scenarios involve carbon stock
  assessments only after the determination that land has become ARD land. </p>
<p>Existing forest inventory systems may not be adequate to assess stock changes
  resulting from ARD activities. For example, the U.S. National Forest Inventory
  uses a two-phase sampling system that determines the forest/non-forest condition
  of approximately 3 million plots (using aerial photographs) in the first phase
  and establishes 300,000 permanent field plots in a second phase. Although information
  collected from forested field plots should be quite adequate to estimate carbon
  stocks, there are insufficient data from non-forested areas to accurately assess
  stocks. An example would be a plot that was forested at one field visit, during
  which adequate carbon stock information was obtained. Subsequent conversion
  to a non-forest condition might mean the plot is no longer visited in the field,
  although it might still contain a substantial portion of the pre-conversion
  carbon stock. This plot could meet the criteria for Article 3.3, yet insufficient
  information would be available to assess the stock change. Similarly, application
  of a definitional scenario based solely on a low percentage of forest cover
  might result in inclusion of urban lands as forest. For example, an area of
  non-forest land may be developed for urban use and sufficient trees planted
  to exceed the minimum cover threshold. Because this land would be classified
  as forest under such a scenario, its carbon stock would be eligible for Kyoto
  Protocol purposes. </p>
<p>Most current forest inventories were developed to efficiently estimate merchantable
  wood production, not biomass or carbon content. Forest inventories generally
  provide estimates of main stem volume in a green condition. The use of conversion/
  expansion factors enables estimation of biomass and carbon from stemwood volume.
  This technique may mask significant gaps in data for some forest conditions,
  which may be important depending on the scenario. For example, wood volume in
  small trees and younger stands is rarely included in forest inventories, causing
  difficulty in reliably estimating forest biomass. This situation applies to
  any afforestation/reforestation activities involving young stands. In particular,
  scenarios in which regeneration after harvest constitutes reforestation (the
  FAO and Land Cover scenarios) will involve large afforestation/ reforestation
  areas with young stands. For these cases, special regeneration surveys may be
  required. The lack of information on the dynamics of young stands (including
  soil carbon pools) is particularly critical in the first commitment period,
  when the old stands in the ARD lands will be at most 23 years old. </p>
<p>If the forest products pool is included in the carbon stocks to be reported
  under Article 3.3, a substantial body of additional data will be required, including
  estimates of carbon in wood products and the fate of this carbon. This type
  of data is unavailable in many countries, and collection of such data may be
  costly in relation to the stock change reported. </p>
