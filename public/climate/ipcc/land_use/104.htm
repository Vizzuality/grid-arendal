<h3>2.5.2. Options for Assessing and Strengthening the Sustainable Development
  Contributions of LULUCF Climate Mitigation Measures</h3>
<p>Potential LULUCF climate mitigation measures can have highly variable environmental
  and socioeconomic impacts (see <a href="096.htm">Sections 2.5.1</a> and <a href="283.htm">5.5</a>),
  depending on the measures and the means by which they are implemented. Article
  2.1(a) of the Kyoto Protocol provides an impetus for Parties to assess these
  impacts to determine whether and how any LULUCF climate mitigation measures
  carried out within their borders may contribute to national sustainable development
  objectives. Because countries often have very different views about what constitutes
  sustainable development, such national objectives might be expected to vary
  widely. In addition, Article 2.1(b) provides that Parties might consider whether
  and how to establish some common approaches to promoting the sustainable development
  contributions of LULUCF measures-for example, to ensure that these impacts are
  evaluated consistently across Parties. The Parties might also develop common
  approaches to ensure that LULUCF activities and projects under the Protocol
  are consistent with the goals and objectives of other multilateral environmental
  agreements (<a href="106.htm">Section 2.5.2.2</a>). For projects between countries,
  the Parties may also decide to assess whether potential projects are consistent
  with the sustainable development objectives of investor and host countries.
</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the Parties opt for a strictly national or multinational
  approach to sustainable development, a system of criteria and indicators would
  be useful for assessing and comparing sustainable development impacts across
  alternative LULUCF actions. An ideal set of sustainable development indicators
  would feature many of the same general characteristics as an ideal accounting
  system: transparency, consistency, comparability, completeness, and accuracy.
  No comprehensive set of indicators with these characteristics currently exists
  for the suite of LULUCF policies and measures considered in this Special Report.
  Several approaches have been developed for related purposes that the Parties
  might adapt to gauge the sustainable development contributions of LULUCF definitions,
  activities, and projects undertaken to mitigate GHG emissions. This section
  highlights approaches that have been developed explicitly for the purposes of
  assessing the environmental and/or socioeconomic impacts of policies or measures
  undertaken at international, national, or project levels. These approaches are
  not mutually exclusive; several could be adapted by the Parties to be used in
  concert. Criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management are most
  directly adaptable to specific LULUCF measures at the national and project levels
  (<a href="108.htm#s2-5-2-4-1">Section 2.5.2.4.1</a>). </p>
<p>The following sections briefly describe each approach and discuss key factors
  that may affect its potential application to LULUCF activities and projects.
  In addition, potential tools-such as environmental screens and the application
  of environmental impact assessments-by which selected criteria and indicators
  could be applied to strengthening the sustainable development contributions
  of LULUCF activities and/or projects are identified and evaluated. As with criteria
  and indicators, Parties could adopt these tools on a national or multinational
  basis. More specific approaches to strengthen the national and local sustainable
  development contributions of LULUCF projects are described in <a href="286.htm">Section
  5.6</a>. </p>
