<h5>2.5.1.2.2. Agriculture, employment, and poverty </h5>
<p>Although expanding the area of forest generates many environmental and socioeconomic
  benefits for society, it generally comes at the cost of forgone opportunities
  for other activities, especially agriculture. Social impacts can include population
  displacement and loss by some section of society, but the net effect of land-use
  change on employment, income, and equity cannot generally be determined a <i>priori</i>:
  It must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with specific social conditions
  in each country taken into account in assessing overall impact. In principle,
  the decision to limit deforestation carries opportunity costs as well because
  it entails forgoing other potential land uses, such as agriculture. In many
  developed countries with agricultural surpluses-notably in Europe-or relatively
  abundant marginal agricultural land (e.g., the United States), there is considerable
  scope for increased afforestation on agricultural land with relatively little
  adverse effect on agricultural production, employment, or economic well-being.
</p>
<p>Several studies in the United States have examined the scope of afforestation
  of agricultural land for carbon sequestration. Some of these studies (e.g.,
  Moulton and Richards, 1990; Parks and Hardie, 1995; Stavins, 1999) have ignored
  the effects of afforestation on land markets and thereby on the agricultural
  sector. A study by Adams et al. (1993) found that large-scale afforestation
  programs in the United States could have potentially sizable impacts on the
  agricultural sector by diverting land from agriculture and increasing agricultural
  prices. Alig <i>et al.</i> (1997) developed an integrated model of the forest
  and agricultural sectors of the U.S. economy and used this model to assess the
  likely impact of a fairly crude afforestation program with limited long-term
  incentives. They found that much of the land converted from agriculture to forests
  could be offset simply by converting other land from forestry to agriculture
  to maintain equilibrium in the land market. Although this forest-to-agriculture
  conversion reduces the social cost of afforestation programs, it also reduces
  their carbon sequestration potential.<br>
  Adams <i>et al.</i> (1999) demonstrated that the scope and timing of forest-based
  carbon sequestration activities have important effects on the social costs of
  the policy and the intersectoral impacts between forestry and agriculture. Their
  study suggested that carbon sequestration activities within existing land uses
  under Article 3.4 (e.g., changes in forest management) would induce less intersectoral
  spillover between the forest and agricultural sectors than would land-use change
  activities under Article 3.3. </p>
<p>In the tropics, afforestation could enhance or impoverish local agriculture
  and increase or decrease employment and wealth, depending on specific circumstances.
  On one hand, some of the biomass from new plantations could provide green manure,
  fodder, or fuelwood, which releases cow dung and crop residues to be incorporated
  into the soil. This biomass could increase overall agricultural production and
  reduce the pressure on natural forests (Ravindranath and Hall, 1995). Plantations
  can also provide employment, especially if they are organized through partnerships
  with local communities and if there are opportunities for the utilization of
  non-timber forest products (Indonesian First National Communication, 1999; TERI,
  1999). </p>
<p>On the other hand, new plantations may take fertile land of high value from
  vulnerable groups, such as small farmers and landless rural people. Conversion
  of such land to forests could threaten the livelihoods of local groups, increase
  poverty, and perhaps accelerate deforestation elsewhere. The use of agroforestry
  may often provide a viable combination of carbon storage with the least effects
  on the food production capacity of the land. The inclusion of trees will typically
  increase the carbon density of sites relative to traditional agriculture, thereby
  providing climate change mitigation benefits. Agroforestry has also been demonstrated
  to produce many of the other environmental benefits of forests, however, as
  well as diversifying the income base of the individuals practicing it. Conversion
  of degraded croplands that are typical of smallholder farming in sub-Saharan
  Africa into agroforests has major positive impact on carbon storage, but it
  has also become key to food security and a way out of poverty for millions of
  African farmers (Sanchez <i>et al.</i>, 1997a,b; Sanchez, 2000). </p>
<p>Not only can changes in agricultural and agroforestry practices directly enhance
  carbon storage in soils, improvements in these practices on the forest margin
  can reduce deforestation pressure and corresponding emissions of carbon. The
  net effect of changes in agricultural practices on deforestation, however, may
  depend on the relative input intensity of the technologies that are applied.
  Capital and land-intensive technologies on the forest margin may further the
  rate of deforestation; labor-intensive technologies are less likely to do so.
</p>
<p>Forests are valued for many goods and services, as reflected in recent forest
  policy and institutional changes in many countries. In contrast, carbon is a
  single commodity, and any form of carbon in trees and soils will suffice as
  long as it is securely stored. Promotion of carbon over other forest values
  could impoverish people who benefit from the diversity of products and non-carbon
  services. This problem will be greatest where livelihoods are at stake, especially
  where food security is threatened (Ogle, 1995), as well as where the interests
  of forest-dependent people are poorly represented (Tipper and de Jong, 1998).
  This factor is particularly important in countries with low per capita incomes
  that are not self-sufficient in terms of growing food and have a low capacity
  to finance food imports. <br>
