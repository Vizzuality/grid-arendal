<h3>Discrepancies between Actual and Reported Stock Changes </h3>
<p>Some definitions of ARD could result in Parties receiving "credits" (i.e.,
  additions to their assigned amounts) for activities that result in an increase
  or no change in atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentrations (type I discrepancy). An example
  is deforestation after 1990, followed by agricultural land use then reforestation
  to create credits in a commitment period. Although carbon emissions associated
  with the deforestation would not be reported, the sequestration associated with
  reforestation during a commitment period may be. Conversely, some definitions
  could result in Parties receiving debits (i.e., deductions from their assigned
  amounts) for emissions associated with activities that result in reductions
  or no change in atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentrations (type II discrepancy). For example,
  a harvest during the commitment period on land afforested since 1990 could result
  in debits, despite the net carbon sequestered since 1990. </p>
<p>Several potential options would avoid these discrepancies: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Define reforestation under Article 3.3 such that it specifies either a
    minimum period during which the land must have been non-forest prior to reforestation
    or a point in time prior to reforestation at which the land must have been
    non-forest (e.g., 1990). </li>
  <li> Limit the credits and debits available from reforestation/ deforestation
    under Article 3.3. For example, credit for reforestation could be awarded
    only for carbon stock increases above the stocks on the land prior to deforestation
    (or in 1990). This approach avoids the type I discrepancy. Data on stocks
    in 1990 are required in Article 3.4; left unspecified, however, is whether
    this information should be reported at the country level or the activity level
    or whether the data should be site specific. Other data could be used as a
    proxy for geo-referenced stocks in 1990 or prior to deforestation-for example,
    crown-cover data from satellite imagery. To avoid the type II discrepancy,
    carbon debits on afforested or reforested lands could be limited to net credits
    (i.e., credits minus debits) received for carbon accumulating on the same
    land (A/R Debit Rule). </li>
</ul>
<h3>Land-Based versus Activity-Based Accounting</h3>
<p>In an activity-based accounting system, the starting point is the carbon stock
  change attributable to ARD activities. This method may require distinction of
  the activity effect from background or baseline carbon stock changes. It is
  conceivable to have more than one activity per unit land, but it will be difficult
  to separate the stock changes attributable to individual activities. The total
  ARD land area can increase or decrease because activities can have different
  durations. </p>
<p>In a land-based accounting system, the starting point is the total carbon stock
  change in applicable carbon pools on land units subject to an ARD activity.
  This method involves first identifying land units on which such activities occur,
  then determining the total change in carbon stocks on these land units. This
  approach assumes that all carbon stock changes will be considered (i.e., that
  there is no baseline). Once a unit of land enters the accounting system, the
  net effect of multiple activities (e.g., deforestation then reforestation) may
  be accounted, even though only one of these activities has triggered the land
  to become ARD land. ARD land area increases with each successive commitment
  period. </p>
<p>Another question under the land-based accounting system is whether carbon stock
  changes for ARD activities initiated after 1 January 2008 should be assessed
  beginning on 1 January 2008 or with the onset of the activity. If accounting
  begins with the activity, a stock change prior to that activity but in the commitment
  period will remain unaccounted. For example, if a harvest that is not defined
  as an activity under Article 3.3 precedes an event that is defined as reforestation
  under Article 3.3, there could be a discrepancy between actual and reported
  carbon stock changes during a commitment period. Similarly, if a forest is degraded
  from full stocking in 2008 to zero stocking in 2012, the carbon loss would be
  counted only from the time at which the threshold between forest and non-forest
  is crossed (e.g., in 2011). A significant part of the stock change might be
  missed. If accounting begins when the activity takes place and not at the beginning
  of the commitment period, data requirements will greatly increase. </p>
<p>This chapter analyzes three possible combinations of options: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i> Activity-based approach.</i> Carbon accounting begins with the start
    of the activity or on 1 January 2008, whichever is later. Any stock changes
    prior to the activity remain unaccounted because they do not result from the
    ARD activity. Any stock change that occurs after the start of the activity
    but does not result from the activity is not accounted. An example is decaying
    slash from a harvest that is followed by reforestation (FAO scenario). </li>
  <li><i> Land-based approach I.</i> All carbon stock changes on ARD land are
    counted, beginning on 1 January 2008. </li>
  <li><i> Land-based approach II.</i> All carbon stock changes on ARD land are
    counted, beginning with the start of the activity or with 1 January 2008,
    whichever is later. In this approach, for example, decaying slash would be
    counted as a negative carbon stock change. </li>
</ul>
