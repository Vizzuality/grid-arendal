<h3>1.3.1. Carbon Stocks and Flows in Major Biomes </h3>
<p>For the estimation of present and future carbon sequestration potential, it
  is necessary to consider broad vegetation types differentiated by climatic zones
  and water availability (i.e., tropical, temperate, and boreal regions). <a href="019.htm#table1-1">Table
  1-1</a> lists the areas, current estimates of aboveground and below-ground carbon
  stocks, and NPP of the world's major regions or biomes. Within each biome, large
  additional variation exists resulting from local conditions and topography.
  In the tropics, for example, moist and dry forests have widely differing carbon
  stocks and NPP. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Pristine forests (e.g., in the wet tropics or boreal region) were long believed
    to be mostly in a state of equilibrium, such that over a period of several
    years their carbon balance would be neutral. This view has been challenged
    in more recent years by increasing evidence from sample plot studies that
    undisturbed areas of forests also sequester carbon (e.g., Lugo and Brown,
    1993; Phillips <i>et al.</i>, 1998, for the tropics; Schulze <i>et al.</i>,
    1999, for the Siberian boreal forest). These carbon quantities will eventually
    be returned to the atmosphere when patches of trees die for biological or
    climatic reasons, localized natural disturbance occurs, or compartments of
    the forest are cleared. Because of its importance to the Kyoto Protocol, carbon
    sequestration by managed and unmanaged forests is considered in some detail
    below (<a href="026.htm">Section 1.3.2</a>). </li>
  <li> Grassland ecosystems store most of their carbon in soils, where turnover
    is relatively slow (<a href="019.htm#table1-1">Table 1-1</a>). In most grassland
    types, below-ground NPP is at least equal to or higher than aboveground production.
    Carbon accumulation by combined aboveground and below-ground NPP may be as
    much as 3.4 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in tropical humid savannas and as little as 0.7
    t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in tropical dry savannas and 0.5 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in temperate
    steppe (Parton <i>et al.</i>, 1995). </li>
  <li>Wetlands are important reservoirs of carbon. Undrained peatlands in high
    latitudes have accumulated appreciable amounts of carbon from the atmosphere
    since the retreat of the ice and continue to be significant CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
    sinks (0.2-0.5 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), but they are also sources
    of methane (0.03-0.3 t CH<span class="subscript">4</span> ha<sup>-1</sup>
    yr<sup>-1</sup>). By contrast, peatlands that are drained for agriculture
    or for afforestation release carbon as CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
    because of accelerated decomposition of the aerobic peat (Cannell <i>et al.</i>,
    1993), although they no longer release methane in significant amounts. The
    quantitative balance between these two processes is poorly understood (Cannell
    <i>et al.</i>, 1999), although it is important because the GWP of methane
    is 21 times that of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> (see <a href="018.htm">Section
    1.2</a>). Peatlands drained for agriculture continue to be a sustained carbon
    source as long as any peat remains in the soil. Peatlands drained for afforestation
    may continue to be a source of carbon in spite of forest biomass growth (Zoltai
    and Martikainen, 1985), but under certain climatic conditions they can also
    revert to carbon sinks (Minkkinen and Laine, 1998). </li>
  <li>In agricultural land, by far most of the carbon is stored below ground (see
    <a href="019.htm#table1-1">Table 1-1</a>). Losses of carbon from terrestrial
    systems during the past 200 years, particularly until the middle of the 20th
    century, were mostly the result of the establishment of agriculture on grassland
    and land that was previously covered by forests. Regular plowing, planting,
    and harvesting led to enhanced oxidation of organic matter in the soils, which
    has been emitted into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Today, agricultural
    lands are major sources of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> in many countries as a result of past land-use
    changes (e.g., Cannell <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Soil organic carbon in cultivated
    soils is continuing to decline in many areas of the world. The use of fertilizers,
    high-yielding plant varieties, residue management, and reduced tillage for
    erosion control has contributed to the stabilization or increase in soil organic
    carbon (Cole <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Sombroek <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Blume <i>et
    al.</i>, 1998).</li>
