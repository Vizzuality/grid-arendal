<h5>5.4.2.1.3. Alternative approaches </h5>
<p>Alternative approaches have been proposed to better address the temporal dimension
  of carbon storage. Most of these approaches are based on adopting a two-dimensional
  measurement unit that reflects storage and time-namely, the ton-year. Many authors
  have proposed the concept of a ton-year unit (Moura-Costa, 1996a,b; Fearnside,
  1997; Greenhouse Challenge Office, 1997; Chomitz, 1998; Dobes <i>et al.</i>,
  1998; Tipper and de Jong, 1998; Fearnside <i>et al.</i>, 2000; Moura-Costa and
  Wilson, 2000). The general concept of the ton-year approach is in the application
  of a factor to convert the climatic effect of temporal carbon storage to an
  equivalent amount of avoided emissions (the remainder of this section refers
  to this factor as the equivalence factor, or Ef ); this factor varies from 0.007
  to 0.02 (Dobes <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Tipper and de Jong, 1998; Moura-Costa and
  Wilson, 2000). This factor is derived from the "equivalence time" concept (referred
  to as Te in the remainder of this section): the length of time that CO<span class="subscript">2</span> must
  be stored as carbon in biomass or soil to prevent the cumulative radiative forcing
  effect exerted by a similar amount of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> during its residence in the atmosphere
  (Moura-Costa and Wilson, 2000). <a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a> describes the
  theory and methods used for determining <i>E<span class="subscript">f</span></i>.

	  The project receives yearly credits calculated as the total amount of
	  carbon stored in any given year, multiplied by an equivalence factor,
	  Ef. Alternatively (in the case of <i>stock change crediting with ton-year
	  liability adjustment</i>), credits could be given as carbon is stored
	  (solid line); in case of any event leading to the release of carbon
	  stored, the amount of credits to be returned would be calculated as
	  the difference between the solid line and the dotted line at that point

<p>Irrespective of the method used to calculate the equivalence factors, they
  could be useful for the accounting of GHG benefits of LULUCF projects. Different
  applications have been proposed (Moura-Costa and Wilson, 2000); in practice,
  a combination of approaches can be used, as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Equivalence-adjusted average storage,</i> using Te as the denominator
    of the average storage equation. This method could be used to standardize
    the way in which the average storage method is currently used.</li>
  <li><i>Stock change crediting with ton-year liability adjustment,</i> giving
    projects credits according to the stock change method but using ton-years
    to calculate the amount of credits to be removed in the case of any noncompliance
    (in the case of occurrence of risk-related events).</li>
  <li><i>Equivalence-factor yearly crediting (ton-years),</i> by which a project
    is credited yearly with a fraction of its total GHG benefit; this fraction
    is determined by the amount of carbon stored each year, converted using <i>E<span class="subscript">f</span></i>
    (<a href="#figure5-4">Figure 5-4</a>). This approach would greatly discourage
    the implementation of LULUCF projects.</li>
  <li><i>Equivalence-delayed full crediting,</i> recognizing the full benefits
    of carbon sequestration only after storage for a time period <i>Te</i> <a href="#figure5-5">(Figure
    5-5</a>). This delayed crediting likely would discourage the implementation
    of LULUCF projects.</li>
  <li><i>Ex-ante ton-year crediting,</i> giving projects an amount of credits
    at the beginning of the project, according to the planned project duration,
    using the ton-year approach. This approach would reduce the disadvantages
    that delayed crediting would create for project developers.</li>
