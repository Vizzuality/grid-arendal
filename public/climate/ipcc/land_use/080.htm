<h5>2.4.2.1.2. Total tree biomass </h5>
<p>For live tree biomass, diameters of a sample of trees are measured and converted
  to biomass and carbon estimates using allometric biomass regression equations.
  Such equations exist for many forest types; some are species-specific, whereas
  others, particularly in the tropics, are more generic in nature (e.g., Alves
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Brown, 1997; Schroeder <i>et al.</i>, 1997). Cutting and
  weighing a sufficient number of trees to represent the size and species distribution
  in a forest to generate local allometric regression equations with high precision,
  particularly in complex tropical forests, is extremely time-consuming and costly
  and may be beyond the means of most projects. The advantage of using generic
  equations, stratified by ecological zones (e.g., dry, moist, and wet; see Brown,
  1997), is that they tend to be based on a larger number of trees (Brown, 1997)
  and span a larger range of diameters; these factors increase the precision of
  the equations. A disadvantage is that the generic equations may not accurately
  reflect the true biomass of trees in the project. Relatively inexpensive field
  measurements performed at the beginning of a project can be used to check the
  validity of the generic equations, however. It is very important that the database
  for regression equations contain large-diameter trees because such trees tend
  to account for more than 30 percent of the aboveground biomass in mature tropical
  forests (Brown and Lugo, 1992; Pinard and Putz, 1996). For plantation or agroforestry
  projects, developing or acquiring local biomass regression equations is less
  problematic because much work is done on plantation forestry (e.g., Lugo, 1997).
  Dead wood, both lying and standing, is an important carbon pool in forests that
  should be measured for an accurate representation of carbon stocks. Methods
  have been developed for this component and tested in many forest types. The
  non-tree component of the vegetation (understory, shrubs, mosses, lichens) may
  also be important in some forests and should be included in measurements. </p>
<p>The carbon content per unit mass of plant tissue varies little within a species
  and tissue type but can vary significantly between tissue types (e.g., fruits
  vs. wood) and function groups of plants (e.g., trees vs. grasses). Default values
  generally can be used, but they should be supported by a validated sample. </p>
<p>Roots are an important part of the carbon cycle because they transfer large
  amounts of carbon directly into the soil, where it may be stored for a long
  time. Most of the below-ground biomass of forests is contained in coarse roots-generally
  defined as >2 mm-but most of the annual growth is allocated to fine roots (Deans,
  1981; Jackson <i>et al.</i>, 1997). Part of the carbon in roots is used to increase
  biomass, but carbon is also lost through exudation, respiration, and decomposition.
  Although some roots may extend to great depths (Canadell <i>et al.</i>, 1996),
  the overwhelming proportion of the total root biomass is generally found within
  30 cm of the soil surface (Jackson <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Measuring the amounts
  of biomass in roots and their turnover is an extremely costly exercise. Therefore,
  regression equations are often used to extrapolate aboveground biomass to whole-tree
  biomass (Kurz <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Cairns <i>et al.</i>, 1997). The problem
  with this approach is that deforestation and harvests (as well as changing environmental
  factors) may change the relationship between aboveground and below-ground biomass.
  On the other hand, below-ground carbon might still be assessed from a known
  history of aboveground vegetation. </p>
