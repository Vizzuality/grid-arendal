<h2>4.5. Biofuels and Forest Products </h2>
<p>This section focuses on biofuels and forest products and their implications
  for land use and carbon dynamics. <a href="190.htm#s4-4-5">Section 4.4.5</a>
  discusses the in situ stock of carbon in growing forest; this section deals
  with carbon in forest products (<a href="209.htm">Section 4.5.6</a>) and the
  tradeoff between biofuels and in situ sequestration, including environmental
  and socioeconomic impacts (<a href="206.htm">Sections 4.5.2</a>, <a href="207.htm">4.5.3</a>,
  <a href="207.htm#s4-5-4">4.5.4</a> and <a href="208.htm">4.5.5</a>). Fact Sheets
  at the end of this chapter deal with tradeoffs (<a href="243.htm">Fact Sheet
  4.20</a>), biofuel from plantations (<a href="244.htm">Fact Sheet 4.21</a>),
  and biofuel from food and fiber production wastes such as sawdust (<a href="245.htm">Fact
  Sheet 4.22</a>). </p>
<h3><a name="s4-5-1"></a>4.5.1. Introduction </h3>
<p>When biomass displaces fossil fuels, the mitigation is captured as a decrease
  in fossil fuel use. The change in carbon stored in and on the land during biofuel
  growth must be accounted for separately. Tradeoffs between carbon storage and
  displacement of fossil fuels and energy-intensive materials have implications
  for land use and forest management. Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol clearly
  distinguishes between biofuels and fossil fuels, establishing that biofuels
  are part of the cycling of carbon in the biosphere. Distinguishing biofuels
  from other fuels entails assessing options for managing carbon through the land-use
  change and forestry sector and looking at effects in the energy sector. </p>
<p>Globally, biofuel contributes about 14 percent of primary energy supply. Most
  biofuel use is traditional wood fuel in developing countries, but agricultural
  and forest wastes provide significant industrial feedstocks for energy production
  in developed economies (see <a href="244.htm">Fact Sheets 4-21</a> and <a href="245.htm">4-22</a>).
  Modern biofuel technology can provide electricity, gases, and transportation
  fuels and more efficiently support traditional uses of wood fuel, with environmental
  and social benefits. These benefits include job creation, productive use of
  surplus agricultural land, avoidance of health hazards from traditional wood
  burning, reduced urban and agricultural wastes, and nutrient recycling. </p>
<p>Agroforestry systems can provide multiple benefits, including energy, to rural
  communities, with synergies between sustainable development and GHG mitigation.
  Large-scale biofuel production raises questions, however, involving land availability
  and productivity (short- and long-term), species selection and mixtures, environmental
  sustainability, social and economic feasibility, and ancillary effects. Issues
  include fertilizer and pesticide requirements, nutrient cycling, energy balances,
  biodiversity impacts, hydrology and erosion, conflicts with food production,
  and the level of financial subsidies required. </p>
<p>Three broad questions arise if biofuels are to significantly reduce net CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  emissions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Is sufficient land available to meet demand for food, fiber, and energy?</li>
  <li>Do adverse environmental and social impacts negate the advantages of biofuels?
  </li>
  <li>Why aren't modern biofuels more widely used now?</li>
</ul>
<p>Underlying these questions is the tradeoff between stocking carbon in standing
  forest and producing a flow of woody biomass that displaces fossil fuels directly
  as biofuel or by displacing energy-intensive building materials. </p>
<p>The key message of this section is that managing land use for maximum on-site
  carbon storage may not always result in the most effective mitigation of GHG
  emissions. Increased carbon storage in the biosphere yields benefits, but over
  time greater mitigation is possible by managing the entire system-including
  the production and use of biofuels and other products. </p>
<p>From a policy perspective, the potential for biofuel displacement of fossil
  fuel is an order of magnitude greater than any other land-use change. It may
  also impact atmospheric carbon levels earlier and at lower cost than other energy
  sector measures. This consideration has significant precautionary potential
  against the possibility that undesired climate effects may occur at lower levels
  of atmospheric GHG than have been previously postulated (e.g., the threshold
  for rapid, nonlinear climate change, which is currently unknown) (Houghton,
  1998). </p>
