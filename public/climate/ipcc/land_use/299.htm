<h3>6.1.2. The IPCC Guidelines and the UNFCCC </h3>
<p>The IPCC developed its Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories in
  1995 to enable all Parties to report national inventories of anthropogenic emissions
  of all GHGs by sources and removals by sinks under Articles 4.1a and 12.1a of
  the UNFCCC. The IPCC recognizes that improving the Guidelines is an ongoing
  process, consistent with Article 7.2 of the UNFCCC. </p>
<p>The IPCC improved the 1995 guidelines and published the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines
  for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories in 1997; the SBSTA recommended that
  Parties use these Revised Guidelines. </p>
<p>The process for improving the Guidelines can be initiated by a request from
  the SBSTA to the IPCC. Currently, there is no mandate for the IPCC to improve
  the Guidelines or develop guidelines for projects. Any improvement to the IPCC
  Guidelines, however, may remain under the remit of the IPCC. </p>
<p>The IPCC is now developing good practice guidance (GPG) for managing uncertainty
  of GHG inventories for many sectors (IPCC, 1999), including LUCF in 2000. The
  combined use of the Guidelines and the GPG can enhance the accuracy and comparability
  of national GHG inventories. </p>
<h3><a name="s6-1-3"></a>6.1.3. The IPCC Guidelines and the Kyoto Protocol </h3>
<p>Under Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol (see <a href="294.htm#box6-1">Box 6-1</a>),
  the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories provide
  the basis for estimating and reporting of anthropogenic emissions by sources
  and removals by sinks of GHGs. The reporting requirements of the Protocol are
  likely to differ from those of the UNFCCC, however. A new development may be
  the use of national GHG inventories to assess compliance with emission limitation
  and reduction commitments of Annex I Parties, as described under Article 3.1
  of the Protocol. </p>
<p>To meet commitments, Parties may use emissions and removals of GHGs from the
  sectors listed in Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol. Annex A of the Protocol details
  all of the sectors from the Guidelines that may be used, with the exception
  of LUCF. The LUCF sector is excluded from Annex A because Parties have yet to
  define the accounting rules for this sector. Articles 3.3, 3.4, and 3.7, however,
  refer to the potential use of agricultural soils and LUCF, as explored elsewhere
  in this Special Report. There is a further requirement to report changes in
  carbon stocks in a way that is transparent and verifiable (Articles 3.3 and
  3.4). </p>
<p>The inclusion of projects under the Protocol may also introduce new criteria
  for reporting. The Protocol includes two project-based mechanisms. The first
  allows for the joint implementation of projects between Annex I Parties (UNFCCC,
  1997, Article 6). The second, the CDM, allows for certified emission reduction
  projects in countries of non-Annex I Parties to assist Annex I Parties in meeting
  their commitments (UNFCCC, 1997, Article 12). In addition, the CDM will assist
  non-Annex I Parties in achieving sustainable development and contribute toward
  the ultimate objective of the FCCC. The Guidelines are intended for reporting
  of national inventories of emissions and removals of GHGs. The principles of
  the Guidelines could be applied, however, to estimate changes in carbon stock
  in projects, although they were not designed to gauge the non-carbon impacts
  of projects or to address sustainable development. </p>
