<h3>Part II </h3>
<h4>3. Issues Associated with Definitions</h4>
<ol start="12">
  <li>For purposes of this Special Report, in a given land area and time period,
    a full carbon accounting system would consist of a complete accounting for
    changes in carbon stocks across all carbon pools. Applying full carbon accounting
    to all land in each country would, in principle, yield the net carbon exchange
    between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. However, the Kyoto Protocol
    specifies, among other things, that attention focus onto those land areas
    subject to "direct human-induced" activities since 1990 (Article 3.3) or human-induced
    activities (Article 3.4). [<a href="064.htm">2.3.2.5</a>]</li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="s3-1"></a>3.1. Forests, Afforestation, Reforestation, and Deforestation
</h4>
<ol start="13">
  <li>There are many possible definitions of a "forest" and approaches to the
    meaning of the terms "afforestation," "reforestation," and "deforestation"
    (ARD). The choice of definitions will determine how much and which land in
    Annex I countries are included under the provisions of Article 3.3, lands
    associated with activities included under Article 3.3 (hereafter "lands under
    Article 3.3"). The amount of land included will have implications for the
    changes in carbon stocks accounted for under Article 3.3. [<a href="045.htm#s2-2-2">2.2.2</a>,
    <a href="047.htm">2.2.3</a>, <a href="123.htm">3.2</a>, <a href="144.htm">3.5.2</a>,
    <a href="148.htm">3.5.3</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Seven definitional scenarios were developed that combine definitions of
    forest and ARD and reflect a range of approaches that can be taken. The scenarios
    are not intended to be exhaustive. They can be split into two representative
    groups, which are discussed in the SPM: 1) scenarios in which only a forest/non-forest
    conversion (i.e., a land-use change triggers accounting under Article 3.3)
    (e.g., IPCC Definitional Scenario), and 2) scenarios in which land-cover change
    or activities trigger accounting under Article 3.3 (e.g., FAO Definitional
    Scenario). [<a href="045.htm#s2-2-2">2.2.2</a>, <a href="047.htm">2.2.3</a>,
    <a href="123.htm">3.2</a>, <a href="144.htm">3.5.2</a>, <a href="148.htm">3.5.3</a>,
    <a href="124.htm#table3-4">Table 3-4</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Countries have defined forests and other wooded lands, for a number of national
    and international purposes, in terms of (i) legal, administrative, or cultural
    requirements; (ii) land use, (iii) canopy cover, or (iv) carbon density (essentially
    biomass density). Such definitions were not designed with the Kyoto Protocol
    in mind and, thus, they may not necessarily suffice for the particular needs
    of Articles 3.3 and 3.4. [<a href="045.htm#s2-2-2">2.2.2</a>, <a href="123.htm">3.2</a>]
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Forest definitions based on legal, administrative, or cultural considerations
    have limitations for carbon accounting as they may bear little relationship
    to the amount of carbon at a site. [<a href="045.htm#s2-2-2">2.2.2</a>, <a href="123.htm">3.2</a>]
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Most definitions of forest are based in part on a single threshold of minimum
    canopy cover. However, such definitions may allow changes in carbon stocks
    to remain unaccounted under Article 3.3. For example, if a high threshold
    for canopy cover (e.g., 70% canopy cover) is used in the definition of a forest,
    then many areas of sparse forest and woodland could be cleared or could increase
    in cover without the losses or gains in carbon being counted under Article
    3.3. If a low threshold is set (e.g., 10% canopy cover), then dense forest
    could be heavily degraded and significant amounts of carbon released, without
    the actions being designated as deforestation. Similarly, a forest, for example
    with 15% canopy cover, could be considerably enhanced without the actions
    qualifying as reforestation or afforestation under Article 3.3. Approaches
    to partly address these problems may include, inter alia, using national,
    regional, or biome-specific thresholds (e.g., a low canopy cover for savannas
    and a high canopy cover for moist forests). [<a href="045.htm#s2-2-2">2.2.2</a>,
    <a href="123.htm">3.2</a>, <a href="126.htm">3.3.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Definitions of forests based on carbon-density thresholds have similar issues
    with respect to thresholds as canopy cover-based definitions. [<a href="045.htm#s2-2-2">2.2.2</a>]
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>There are a number of approaches to definitions of afforestation, reforestation,
    and deforestation. One approach involves the concept of land-use change. Deforestation
    can be defined as the conversion of forest land to non-forest land. Reforestation
    and afforestation can be defined as the conversion of non-forested lands to
    forests with the only difference being the length of time during which the
    land was without forest. [<a href="047.htm">2.2.3</a>, <a href="123.htm">3.2</a>]
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>An alternative definition of deforestation might be based on a decrease
    in the canopy cover or carbon density by a given amount or crossing one of
    a sequence of thresholds. Similarly, afforestation and reforestation could
    be defined in terms of an increase in canopy cover or carbon density. None
    of these definitions involves the concept of a land-use change. [<a href="045.htm#s2-2-2">2.2.2</a>,
    <a href="123.htm">3.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Definitions of a forest based strictly on actual canopy cover without consideration
    of potential canopy cover could lead to harvesting and shifting agriculture
    being referred to as deforestation and to regeneration being referred to as
    reforestation, thus creating additional areas of lands under Article 3.3.
    If the definition of a forest was based on the potential canopy cover at maturity
    under planned land-use practices, harvesting/regeneration activities may not
    fall under Article 3.3. [<a href="045.htm#s2-2-2">2.2.2</a>, <a href="047.htm">2.2.3</a>,
    <a href="123.htm">3.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Some commonly used definitions of reforestation include the activity of
    regenerating trees immediately after disturbance or harvesting where no land-use
    change occurs. If, for example, the definition of deforestation or the accounting
    system do not include disturbance and harvesting, then emissions from a harvested
    stand will not be accounted for. In this particular example, uptake due to
    regeneration would be accounted for, resulting in potentially significant
    credits for which a corresponding net removal of carbon from the atmosphere
    would not occur. This issue could be considered when developing the accounting
    system. [<a href="048.htm">2.2.3.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>There are several consequences of using definitions that lead to the creation
    of lands under Article 3.3 by the harvest-regeneration cycle (i.e., where
    harvesting is included in the definition of deforestation, or regeneration
    is included in the definition of reforestation). For example, a forest estate
    managed on a sustainable-yield basis where an area of forest is cut in a regular
    cycle (e.g., 1/50th of the forest is harvested and regenerated each year on
    a 50-year rotation cycle) may be in approximate carbon balance. However, in
    this case, only those stands harvested or regenerated since 1990 would be
    considered lands under Article 3.3. The regrowth (carbon sink) on these lands
    will be less than the carbon emissions due to harvesting until all stands
    of the estate are lands under Article 3.3. Different definitional and accounting
    approaches would have different accounting consequences. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>If emissions from harvesting during a commitment period are counted
	(land-based approach I; see <a href="007.htm#table3">Table 3</a>), then
	during the first and subsequent commitment periods a net debit could arise
	from a managed forest estate that is approximately in carbon balance.
      </li>
      <li>If emissions from harvesting during a commitment period prior to regeneration
	are not counted (land-based approach II; see <a href="007.htm#table3">Table
	3</a>), then during the first and subsequent commitment periods a net
	credit would generally arise from a managed forest estate that is approximately
	in carbon balance. This may be offset to some extent by delayed emissions
	from soils and harvest residues. </li>
      <li>If emissions from harvesting during a commitment period are not counted
	(activity-based approach; see <a href="007.htm#table3">Table 3</a>), then
	during the first and subsequent commitment periods a net credit would
	arise from regeneration in a managed forest estate that is approximately
	in carbon balance. It would be practically very difficult to separate
	changes in soil carbon pools associated with harvesting and regeneration
	activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <dl>
      <dt>In each of these approaches the accounted stock changes would generally
	be different from the actual net exchange of carbon between this example
	forest estate and the atmosphere during a commitment period. [<a href="123.htm">3.2</a>,
	<a href="144.htm">3.5.2</a>] <br>
	<br>
      </dt>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>Afforestation is usually defined as the establishment of forest on land 
    that has been without forest for a period of time (e.g., 20-50 years or more) 
    and was previously under a different land use. The precise period that distinguishes 
    afforested from reforested land is not important in accounting for lands covered 
    under Article 3.3 provided afforestation and reforestation are treated identically 
    under the Protocol, as they are in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National 
    Greenhouse Gas Inventories.<a href="fn1.htm#2" onClick="showFootnote(1,2); return false;"><sup>2</sup></a> 
    [<a href="047.htm">2.2.3</a>, <a href="126.htm">3.3.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Article 3.3 encompasses ARD activities that have occurred since 1990 but
    recognizes only verifiable carbon stock changes in each commitment period.
    This has several implications. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>For lands deforested between 1990 and the beginning of the first commitment
	period only a fraction of carbon stock changes (such as those from delayed
	carbon emissions from soil and wood products if they are accounted) will
	occur during the commitment period and would be debited under Article
	3.3. If these lands are subsequently reforested then there may be an increase
	in carbon stocks during the commitment period and a credit under Article
	3.3. This would mean that the credit received would not match the actual
	carbon stock changes or the net exchanges of carbon with the atmosphere
	since 1990. </li>
      <li>Another accounting issue could arise when land is reforested or afforested
	between 1990 and 2008 but stocks are reduced either by harvesting or natural
	disturbance during a commitment period. Even though the forest area and
	possibly carbon stocks may have increased since 1990, a debit could be
	recorded in a commitment period. This creates the possibility of a negative
	incentive for establishing forests well in advance of the first commitment
	period, because any stock increase prior to 2008 would not be credited
	but the later loss of this stock would be debited. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <dl>
    <dt> Such outcomes could possibly be addressed through different combinations
      of definitional and accounting approaches. [<a href="126.htm">3.3.2</a>]<br>
      <br>
    </dt>
  </dl>
  <li>There are definitional and carbon accounting issues concerning drawing a
    clear boundary between natural phenomena and human-induced activities, when,
    for example, significant forest losses occur as a result of fires or disturbances
    such as pest outbreaks. In cases involving lands under Article 3.3 or 3.4
    where fires or pest outbreaks occur in a forest, a question is whether accounting
    should, inter alia: (i) count neither the loss nor subsequent uptake of carbon
    (which reflects the actual net change in carbon stocks on those lands and
    exchange of carbon with the atmosphere in the long term, but creates problems
    in continuing to account for the area burnt/defoliated as lands under Article
    3.3 or 3.4); (ii) count both the loss and subsequent uptake of carbon (which
    reflects the actual net change in carbon stocks on those lands and exchange
    of carbon with the atmosphere, but creates an initial carbon debit for the
    Party concerned); (iii) count only the loss of carbon (which would overestimate
    the actual losses of carbon stocks, not represent the exchanges of carbon
    with the atmosphere, and create future accounting problems), or (iv) count
    only the subsequent uptake (which would fail to reflect the actual changes
    in carbon stock and would not represent the exchanges of carbon with the atmosphere,
    and would provide carbon credits for the Party concerned). [<a href="049.htm">2.2.3.3</a>]
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>In cases involving lands that do not fall under Articles 3.3 or 3.4, where
    fires or pest outbreaks trigger land-use change, the consequences are similar
    to deforestation. If similar vegetation cover is allowed to regenerate, such
    disturbances may not lead to a long-term change in carbon stocks. [<a href="090.htm">2.4.4</a>,
    <a href="047.htm">2.2.3</a>, <a href="065.htm">2.3.3</a>] </li>
