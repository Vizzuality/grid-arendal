<h2>2.3. Accounting and Reporting Issues </h2>
<p>A carbon accounting system is needed to provide a consistent and transparent
  approach to recording and reporting of changes in carbon stocks from applicable
  activities for use in meeting commitments under Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol.
  This section presents a general accounting framework and describes some of the
  generic issues that arise in bringing the LULUCF provisions of the Kyoto Protocol
  into operation. Key considerations include how to identify stock changes resulting
  from human-induced activities, the implications of different choices of system
  boundaries and the timing of stock changes, and how to account for incomplete
  data and uncertainty. Subsequent chapters in this Special Report present detailed
  analyses of the implications of these issues for specific provisions of the
  Protocol. </p>
<h3><a name="s2-3-1"></a>2.3.1. Objectives of an Accounting System </h3>
<p>For the purposes of this Special Report, a carbon accounting system records,
  summarizes, and reports the quantity of carbon emissions by sources and removals
  by sinks through applicable LULUCF activities for a specific period of time.
  Through the accounting system, Parties will quantitatively demonstrate the extent
  to which LULUCF activities covered by the Kyoto Protocol affect their emission
  reduction commitments. Building on the principles established in the UNFCCC
  reporting guidelines for annual GHG inventories, an ideal accounting system
  possesses the following core objectives: transparency, consistency, comparability,
  completeness, and accuracy. Moreover, Article 3 of the Protocol requires that
  carbon stock changes be verifiable. Moreover, practical constraints on implementation
  indicate a need to consider the efficiency of an accounting system. These features
  are discussed in turn below. </p>
<h4><a name="s2-3-1-1"></a>2.3.1.1. Transparency </h4>
<p>According to the UNFCCC inventory reporting guidelines, transparency implies
  that the assumptions and methods used are clearly explained so that users of
  the information can replicate and assess the information. For an accounting
  system, transparency means that reported information can be traced back to the
  underlying data through a logical set of procedures that summarize the data.
  For example, reported carbon fluxes may be estimated by a measurement method
  that accounts for all relevant pools; in turn, the measurement method is applied
  to data that represent carbon changes by pool. </p>
<h4><a name="s2-3-1-2"></a>2.3.1.2. Consistency </h4>
<p>The ideal accounting system is consistent with the scientific principles of
  carbon processes and the institutional context in which the system is applied.
  Dimensions of scientific consistency include carbon coverage over space, pools,
  and time. Those aspects are addressed in the full carbon accounting discussion
  below. Institutional consistency refers to the system's correspondence to the
  objectives driving the need for the system in the first place. For the purposes
  of this Special Report, the institutional objective of the accounting system
  is to demonstrate compliance with the Kyoto Protocol. </p>
<h4><a name="s2-3-1-3"></a>2.3.1.3. Comparability </h4>
<p>An accounting system should produce information that is comparable across Parties
  and over time. Because methods and data systems may differ across Parties and
  time, strict comparability may be difficult to maintain. Nonetheless, differences
  in methods and data should be made transparent so that the numbers are as consistent
  and comparable as possible. Comparability may require some form of standardization.
  Although such standards do not exist for a Protocol-specific accounting system,
  the IPCC Guidelines (IPCC, 1997) may provide an initial framework. </p>
