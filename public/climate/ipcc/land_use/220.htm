<h4>4.7.2.3. Fire Management in Savannas </h4>
<p>Reduction in the frequency and/or intensity of fires in savannas is technically
  possible, leading to a modest reduction in the time- and space-averaged emission
  of methane and ozone precursor gases from fires, as well as a gradual accumulation
  of wood and soil carbon. Smoke particles have a small radiative cooling effect,
  and some carbon is stored in the long term as charcoal, but the net effect of
  fire reduction is reduced radiative forcing (Moore <i>et al.</i>, 1997). The
  change in fire frequency is monitored relatively easily with remote sensing;
  if such monitoring is conducted over large areas and multiple years, the change
  in fire frequency can be compared to historical or contemporary baselines. The
  increase in carbon stocks is sufficiently large to be quantifiable through a
  combination of ground or aerial survey. The decrease in fire emissions is difficult
  to measure directly in an operational system, but it can be reliably modeled
  given fire frequency and fuel biomass. There is little risk of leakage: Suppressing
  fires in one savanna region does not encourage them elsewhere because there
  is no demand for fires <i>per se</i>. </p>
<p>The avoided non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions can be considered permanent, whereas the increase
  in carbon stocks is somewhat vulnerable to future fires. The associated impacts
  are a mixture of positive and negative: On the positive side are an increased
  stock of timber resources, reductions in air pollution, and a reduced risk of
  injury or asset loss from fire; negative impacts are mostly related to potentially
  reduced biodiversity and reduced grass production for grazing use. The breadth
  of outcomes on the associated impacts axis reflects the varying degrees to which
  benefits arising from grazing are important in savannas, as well as the varying
  risks of loss of biodiversity (higher carbon gain is associated with greater
  chance of biodiversity changes). </p>
<h4><a name="s4-7-2-4"></a>4.7.2.4. Afforestation on Biodiverse, Water-Limited
  Lands </h4>
<p>Large areas that could be considered for afforestation in non-Annex I countries
  in sub-humid regions are currently covered with native vegetation. Planting
  fast-growing, usually non-indigenous, tree crops into grassland or savanna landscapes
  has the potential to substantially increase the carbon sequestered (e.g., Christie
  and Scholes, 1995)-although this effect depends on effective ongoing plantation
  management, which sometimes is not socioeconomically viable (e.g., Carrere and
  Lohmann, 1996). The area planted and the biomass per hectare are relatively
  easily verified. This activity is clearly human-induced, and it has little leakage
  potential (although it does displace the current land use, which may be reestablished
  somewhere else with negative GHG consequences). </p>
<p>The carbon is stored as leaf, litter, wood, and soil carbon; the first three
  are susceptible to rapid loss through fire-a risk that can be reduced through
  established fire control practices. Where plantations replace biodiverse native
  vegetation in water-limited lands, there are significant negative environmental
  impacts: The water yield from the catchment is significantly reduced (van Wilgen
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998), as is biodiversity. Positive socioeconomic benefits, such
  as wealth or job creation, must be balanced by the loss of welfare resulting
  from reductions in available water, grazing, natural resources, and agricultural
  land. Afforestation of previously eroded or otherwise degraded land may have
  a net positive environmental impact; in catchments where the water yield is
  large or is not heavily used, the streamflow reduction may not be critical.
