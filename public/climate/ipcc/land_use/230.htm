<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.7. Protected Grasslands and Set-Asides </h3>
<p>Changing land use from cropping or degraded lands to perennial grasslands in
  response to government policies can increase aboveground and below-ground biomass
  and soil carbon stocks. </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  Set-aside of marginal and/or degraded cropland to grassland is likely to be
  most predominant in countries with agricultural surpluses, but opportunities
  for set-asides for environmental protection reasons are possible in all countries.
  The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the United States has resulted in
  the set-aside of more than 17 Mha of erodable and environmentally sensitive
  croplands, most of which have been planted to perennial grasses and legumes.
  Several estimates of the potential carbon storage on CRP lands have been made,
  ranging from 12 to 18 Mt C yr<sup>-1</sup> (Gebhart <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Barker <i>et al.</i>,
  1995; Follett <i>et al.</i>, 2000; Paustian <i>et al.</i>, 2000b). Comparable
  per-unit area increases have been reported for studies of conversions to grasslands
  in other temperate regions (Paustian <i>et al.</i>, 1998b), although low or
  non-significant increases have been found in some studies in semi-arid climates
  (Burke <i>et al.</i>, 1995; Robles and Burk,e 1998). Globally, estimates of
  the potential area of cropland that could be placed into set-asides are on the
  order of 100 Mha (IPCC, 1996b). </p>
<p><b>Current Knowledge and Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  The processes involved in carbon storage with conversion of cultivated land
  to perennial grasslands are relatively well understood. Rates vary, however,
  as a function of many site-specific factors, including stand composition and
  establishment, fertilization, and nutrient availability (Huggins <i>et al.</i>,
  1998a). Many rate measurements in the literature are based on paired-site comparisons,
  which increases levels of uncertainty (Huggins <i>et al.</i>, 1998a; Robles
  and Burke, 1998; Follett <i>et al.</i>, 2000). </p>
<p><b>Methods</b><br>
  Where direct sampling is used, soil carbon should be measured to sufficient
  depth (e.g., 1 m) to represent the full rooting zone because of deep carbon
  storage with some species. Carbon stock changes can be directly measured through
  repeated sampling at intervals of 3-5 years or more; the length of the re-measurement
  interval depends on the initial carbon level and the productivity of the grassland
  conversion. Scaling up can be implemented with the use of models and information
  on the location of the pertinent areas; time since conversion; and climate,
  soils, and vegetation composition. </p>
<p><b>Time Scales </b><br>
  Carbon accumulation to levels comparable to native grasslands may take up to
  50 years (McConnell and Quinn, 1988) or longer (Dormaar and Smoliak, 1985; Burke
  <i>et al.</i>, 1995) in temperate regions, but recovery rates will vary according
  to site and management variables. Rapid rates of carbon accumulation are most
  likely in highly productive grassland conversions in mesic environments. </p>
<p><b>Removals</b><br>
  Aboveground biomass is subject to removal by livestock and other herbivores,
  as well as by fire. In the absence of significant erosion or degradation of
  vegetation, sequestered carbon will be maintained in the soil.</p>
<p><b>Permanence </b><br>
  If these lands are returned to crop production, there will be a rapid loss of
  carbon from the soils (Barker <i>et al.</i>, 1995), although re-conversion to
  no-till cropping may reduce these losses. If continuity of management purpose
  is maintained, storage of carbon in soils and root biomass can provide pools
  that persist for years to centuries. </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  Associated impacts include reduced crop production, increased animal production
  (if the land is grazed), increased biodiversity of native grass ecosystems (if
  they are reestablished), increased wildlife habitat, reduced erosion, improved
  water quality, and reduced dryland salinity downslope (in landscapes with this
  hazard). If the land is grazed, methane and nitrous oxide emissions may more
  than offset the sink provided by increasing carbon pools (Crush <i>et al.</i>,
  1992). </p>
<p><b>Relationship to IPCC Guidelines </b><br>
  Grassland set-asides are included in the Reference Manual (which refers to "abandonment
  of managed lands"); the Workbook provides default values of carbon stock changes
  for set-asides that are less than 20 years old and older than 20 years. </p>
