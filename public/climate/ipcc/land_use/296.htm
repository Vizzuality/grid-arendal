<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>The Guidelines do not address projects, although many of the accounting methods
  can be applied to estimate emissions and removals of GHGs, changes in carbon
  stock, and associated activities. Development of guidelines for project activities
  will depend greatly on the level of detail required and future decisions by
  the Conference of Parties (COP). The degree of improvements to the Guidelines
  depends on their intended use. Within each of the options below, Parties could
  choose their own methods, or internationally agreed methods could be stipulated.
  There are three main options, of increasing complexity: </p>
<p><i>Option 1.</i> If the Guidelines are intended to show impacts to a Party's
  assigned amount, a summary of changes in net GHG emissions and removals from
  all projects may be all that is required. The first step would involve the transfer
  of GHG emissions and removals from the project to the national inventory; in
  the second step, the GHGs from projects would be subtracted from the national
  inventory. </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Option 1a</i>-This option would allow Parties to choose a different reporting
    format for projects approved by the Parties. An example would be a modification
    of the Uniform Reporting Format (URF) used in the Activities Implemented Jointly
    Pilot Project. This option is the simplest to operationalize, but it lacks
    transparency in methods and data.</li>
  <li><i>Option 1b</i>-This option could stipulate the use of internationally
    agreed methods and perhaps involve the use of guidance for the URF.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Option 2.</i> If the Guidelines are intended to enable Parties to generate
  a complete and transparent record of GHG emissions and removals of each project,
  including a breakdown of all activities, baselines, leakage, risks, and so forth
  (see methods in <a href="246.htm">Chapter 5</a>), considerable changes will
  be required. </p>
<p><i>Option 3.</i> Finally, there may be a need to report all changes in net
  GHG emissions and removals and environmental and socioeconomic impacts, especially
  for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects (Article 12). </p>
<p>For option 1, a reporting format in the Guidelines could be developed with
  minimal effort. For options 2 and 3, considerable effort may be required. The
  period involved in developing these options would depend on the decisions of
  the Parties. </p>
<p>For projects, many of the data and reporting needs are similar to those of
  Articles 3.3 and 3.4. There is a range of additional features to consider, however,
  including project locations and boundaries, additionality, leakage, permanence,
  biodiversity, and impacts on sustainable development and the environment. The
  Guidelines were not designed for reporting of these features. They do provide
  a basis, however, for reporting changes in emissions and removals of GHGs for
  projects in a single year. To avoid double-counting, projects and national inventories
  should be reported in a consistent way in space and time. </p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Article 5.2 of the Protocol provides a mechanism for Parties to initiate a
  process to improve the accounting methods and default data in the Guidelines.
  The time required to make such improvements depends on the decisions of the
  Parties-including decisions on methods for reporting on projects, which are
  not currently covered by the Guidelines.</p>
<p>Of importance in this context is a decision by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific
  and Technological Advice (SBSTA) at its eighth session to encourage the IPCC
  Inventories Program to "give high priority to completing its work on uncertainty,
  as well as to prepare a report on good practice in inventory management." In
  addition, the "SBSTA invited the IPCC to develop a work plan addressing methodological
  issues raised in the IPCC special report in the context of the IPCC 1996 Revised
  Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories in the areas of agriculture
  and land-use change and forestry, to commence as soon as practicable following
  completion of the special report." This work plan may include good practice
  guidance in LUCF to be initiated in 2000. </p>
<p>Following decisions by the Parties, possible improvements to the Guidelines
  include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reporting of defined activities and changes in carbon stocks associated
    with them </li>
  <li>Methods for accounting for carbon stocks not currently provided in the Guidelines</li>
  <li>Methods for data collection and evaluation of data quality (uncertainties)</li>
  <li>Methods to integrate changes in aboveground biomass, soil carbon, and other
    pools, as well as reporting of these changes spatially and by activity (geo-referencing)</li>
  <li>Reporting for projects that takes into account baselines, system boundaries,
    leakage, and additionality, as well as socioeconomic and non-GHG environmental
    impacts </li>
  <li>Reporting tables for inventories and projects that differentiate between
    the base year, 1990, and the commitment period. Projects that qualify under
    Article 6-and potentially under Article 12-would have to be distinguished,
    reported, and treated differently in the national GHG inventories of Annex
    I and non-Annex I Parties.</li>
</ul>
