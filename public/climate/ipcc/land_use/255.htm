<h3>5.2.4. Potential Magnitude of LULUCF Projects </h3>
<p>The form and magnitude of the eventual markets for ERUs under Article 6 (i.e.,
  Annex I JI) and CERs under Article 12 (the CDM) are difficult to estimate. Key
  policy decisions have not been made by the Parties. This discussion of the potential
  for LULUCF activity in the CDM makes no judgment about the policy issue of whether
  the CDM includes specific LULUCF activities. </p>
<p>No credible, detailed estimates of the magnitude of the potential for LULUCF
  activities in Annex I and in non-Annex I countries are available for the first
  commitment period, 2008-2012 (see <a href="157.htm">Chapter 4</a>). To date,
  macroeconomic model assessments of supply and demand for emissions reductions
  by Annex I countries using the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms (e.g., emissions
  trading, JI, or the CDM) have not separated LULUCF activities or projects. These
  analyses generally do not reflect policy or technical tests and guidance likely
  to be included in the operationalization of Articles 6 and 12. Analyses are
  needed of the potential supply, cost, and demand for LULUCF project-based activities,
  especially at the national level, under realistic scenarios for operating conditions
  under Articles 6 and 12. </p>
<p>The best approximations of Annex I project-level activity would be some small
  fraction-as yet unknown-of estimated country-level Article 3.3 and possibly
  Article 3.4 activities (depending on additional activities the Parties decide
  to include under Article 3.4, if any). Prospective activity levels under these
  two articles are reviewed in <a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a> and <a href="157.htm">4</a>
  (see also Nabuurs <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Project-level activities under Article
  6 likely would be a small subset of these activities, which otherwise have been
  widely assumed to be reported nationally under the two articles, not as projects.
  No estimates of the demand for LULUCF project ERUs under Article 6 have been
  widely reviewed and reported for individual countries or for Annex I as a whole.
</p>
<p>Global economic general equilibrium models have been used to project GHG target
  levels for 2010 for Annex I countries, to estimate the percentage of emissions
  reductions and total financial flows that might occur under Annex I JI or the
  CDM. Austin and Faeth (2000) summarized the results of four independent modeling
  teams. These models have been used to estimate where emissions reductions could
  occur at the lowest cost, largely on the basis of fossil fuel CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions.
  Modeling results project that estimated emissions reductions by Annex I countries
  in the year 2010 (for that year) would come predominately from domestic reductions
  (15-45 percent), Annex I trading (6-10 percent), and "hot air" (8-41 percent).
  (<i>Hot air</i> is a term that describes ERUs predicted to be generated by country
  emissions during the first commitment period below countries' assigned amounts,
  as an artifact of macroeconomic and political changes in economies in transition,
  such as the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Poland.) Some limited set of JI
  projects under Article 6 might be developed, although such projects would compete
  directly with these emissions reduction alternatives. Reductions in developing
  countries were estimated at 33-55 percent (another estimate is 19-57 percent;
  Vrolijk, 1999) of the demand for reductions by Annex I countries. </p>
<p>These models are neither designed to assess LULUCF activities, nor JI or the
  CDM. Project-oriented mechanisms are not likely to deliver the same stream of
  least-cost GHG abatement activities as an efficient emissions trading system,
  carbon tax, or other economic instrument (Austin and Faeth, 2000). Projects
  under Articles 6 and 12 may require certification and reporting costs, and costs
  for projects under Article 12 may also include charges for an adaptation fund
  and administration expenses of the CDM, as well as sustainable development considerations.
  These constraints may reduce the economic efficiency of JI and the CDM relative
  to emissions trading, according to reviews by some economists (e.g., Manne and
  Richels, 1999). </p>
