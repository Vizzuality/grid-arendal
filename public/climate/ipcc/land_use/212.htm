<h3>4.6.1. "Since 1990" </h3>
<p>Article 3.3 allows credit only for ARD activities undertaken since 1990; Article
  3.4 allows credit only for activities during the first commitment period. Aside
  from limiting credits to newly undertaken activities, these requirements have
  two obvious consequences: They withhold credits from Parties that behaved in
  the desired way (regardless of motivation) prior to 1990, and they complicate
  the accounting system by requiring differentiation of activities by date of
  initiation. If the Protocol were to adopt more comprehensive accounting of carbon
  in the biosphere, relaxing the "since 1990" requirement for Article 3.4 activities
  in commitment periods after the first would make accounting simpler. If the
  intent is to give credits only for a short list of narrowly defined activities
  that can be identified in time and space, however, retaining the "since 1990"
  requirement could work toward this objective. Article 3.4 stipulates, in its
  last sentence, that if the additional activities are used to meet commitments
  during the first commitment period (a choice offered to each Party), the "since
  1990" requirement will apply; it does not impose this requirement on subsequent
  commitment periods, however. The options are to either relax this MRG or impose
  another initiation date. Obviously, the later the initiation date, the fewer
  the projects that will qualify and the more likely that qualifying projects
  (or the national scale of an activity) were undertaken for purposes that include
  gaining GHG emissions credits. The earlier the initiation date before 1990 (unless
  no initiation date is set), the more difficult it will be to retrospectively
  gather baseline data, if needed. For instance, remote-sensing data on land cover
  are not available from before the mid-1970s. </p>
<h3><a name="s4-6-2"></a>4.6.2. "Measured as.changes in carbon stocks in each
  commitment period"</h3>
<p>There are two possible approaches for measuring CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions by sources and
  removal by sinks in the biosphere. In most instances, the IPCC Guidelines and
  other conventions estimate the actual exchange of a gas between the system of
  interest and the atmosphere. This approach is used, for example, to measure
  emissions of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> from fossil fuel combustion and CH<span class="subscript">4</span> from landfills. The Kyoto
  Protocol has chosen in Article 3.3 to use the other approach: measuring net
  emissions as the change in carbon stocks in the various reservoirs (see Brown
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Apps <i>et al.</i>, 1997; <a href="062.htm">Sections 2.3.2.3</a>
  and <a href="168.htm">4.3.3</a>). Having made this land-based choice for Article
  3.3 activities, the accounting system may become more complex if an activity-based
  approach is chosen for Article 3.4 activities. This approach may be needed in
  the case of some activities for which distinguishing whether products (e.g.,
  forest products) originate from Article 3.3 or 3.4 activities could be difficult
  once the products are in industrial trade channels. A stock-based approach does
  not work for non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> GHGs; these emissions must be treated by activity-based
  methods. </p>
