<h3>5.2.3. Financial Analysis of LULUCF Project Activities</h3>
<p>Financial analyses of GHG reductions by projects are rarely comparable because
  no standard method of evaluation has emerged and come into wide use. Financial
  analysis of direct, indirect, initial, and recurring costs, as well as the stream
  of revenues, varies across projects. Available cost estimates for LULUCF projects
  often include direct costs incurred by the project developers: land purchase
  or rental costs, if necessary; land clearing and site preparation; initial planting
  or other activity costs; annual, recurring costs of project maintenance and
  management-including, for example, periodic thinning or other stand improvement
  or weed control in agricultural soil management; and sometimes the establishment
  of monitoring data collection and evaluation systems. <br>
  Opportunity costs of land (i.e., the present value of alternative opportunities
  or uses of the land, at the margin) are often not included in financial analyses
  of projects. Other costs often overlooked are infrastructure costs (e.g., road
  development), monitoring data collection and interpretation costs, and maintenance
  or other recurring costs that will be incurred in the future (Mulongoy <i>et
  al.</i>, 1998; Witthoeft-Muehlmann, 1998). The stream of revenues is not widely
  reported for projects to date, in part because few revenues have accrued in
  their early stages of implementation. Revenues may be generated by the sale
  of logs or value-added products from timber harvest, sale of fuelwood or non-timber
  products such as medicinal plants, usage fees for access, government or NGO
  grants for subsidies, in-kind contributions, and sale of emissions reductions.
</p>
<p>Project-level financial analysis methods are widely used and fairly standardized
  in development assistance and private investment projects. They have yet to
  be consistently applied to and reported for LULUCF projects, however-in part
  because of the highly varied expertise of early actors in such projects (Mulongoy
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998). A standard approach for comparing the economic attractiveness
  of different projects would compare the time flow of revenues-including the
  sale of emissions reductions and crediting rules applying to them-with the time
  flow of expenditures, applying appropriate discount rates. Detailed financial
  data are not available for most LULUCF projects, however, so the economic indicators
  often are obtained simply by dividing a project's total carbon sequestration
  or emissions avoidance over time by total expenditures (e.g., Witthoeft-Muehlmann,
  1998). A further complication relates to how emissions reductions are allocated
  between the sellers and investors. The unit cost of reduction will vary directly
  with the percentage of total reductions that accrue to the investor. </p>
<p>Cost and investment estimates are available for virtually all of the projects
  in <a href="253.htm#table5-2">Table 5-2</a>; because of the different methods
  used in the estimates, however, only summary ranges are reported in <a href="#table5-3">Table
  5-3</a>. The costs of GHG benefits in these projects range from $0.1-28 per
  t C, simply dividing project costs by their total reported carbon benefits.
  Most of the cost estimates are in the range of $1-15 per t C, with a higher
  range for reforestation and afforestation projects (reflecting the inclusion
  of temperate and boreal projects). Mulgonoy <i>et al.</i> (1998) reviewed cost
  estimates for LULUCF carbon projects and found that most estimates for the tropics
  fall in the range of $2-25 per t C. Two other reviews reported costs of sets
  of projects in temperate and tropical biomes ranging from $4-26 (Swisher and
  Masters, 1992) and $2-12 per t C (Witthoeft-Muehlmann, 1998). Other studies
  are consistent with these results (Dixon <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Brown <i>et al.</i>,
  1996; Stuart and Moura-Costa, 1998). </p>

<p>Other methodological issues include the absence of discounting in most of the
  available cost estimates, to reflect the time value of the investment and the
  production of GHG benefits. The choice of accounting approach also is important.
  If the ton-year approach (<a href="273.htm">Section 5.4.2.</a>) were used, these
  costs would tend to rise from about 50 percent to several times that, because
  fewer GHG benefits could be credited over a similar time frame. <br>
  Estimated total investment committed to date in projects in <a href="#table5-3">Table
  5-3</a> is about $160 million; this amount could grow to about $330 million
  if these projects were fully funded and implemented, although these estimates
  are provisional (EPA/USIJI, 1998; Stuart and Moura-Costa, 1998; Witthoeft-Muehlmann,
  1998). Developers' project costs per ton of carbon are likely to change from
  these initial estimates over time. The price and supply of certified emissions
  reductions will be revealed if a market for them develops and as the eventual
  eligibility and requirements for various articles of the Kyoto Protocol become
  known. Costs may tend to decrease if economies of scale and technology transfer
  become widely available, potentially via development of portfolios of projects
  by entities transferring common, state-of-the-art methods to countries and projects.
  The Costa Rican Government's PAP, for example, undertook land-use data collection,
  baseline development, and establishment of monitoring systems for virtually
  all public lands in the country. The parallel Private Forest Program (PFP) provided
  some of the same services for private forest lands. In both cases, the goal
  was to reduce barriers to investment for carbon benefits (Tattenbach, 1996;
  Subak, 2000). </p>
