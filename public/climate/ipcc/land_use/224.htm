<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.1. Agricultural Intensification and Carbon Inputs
</h3>
<p>Farming practices that enhance production and the input of plant-derived residues
  to soil include crop rotations, reduced bare fallow, cover crops, high-yielding
  varieties, integrated pest management, adequate fertilization, organic amendments,
  irrigation, water table management, site-specific management, and other proper
  management practices. These practices are referred to collectively as agriculture
  intensification (Lal <i>et al.</i>, 1999b; Bationo <i>et al.</i>, 2000; Resck
  <i>et al.</i>, 2000; Swarup <i>et al.</i>, 2000). For more detail, see <a href="173.htm">Section
  4.4.2.1</a>. </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential</b><br>
  Increasing global demand for food will drive continued agriculture intensification.
  Intensification can be applied to all cropping systems, with varying degrees
  of constraints because of economics and the availability of labor and technology.
  Rates of residue return to soil are also influenced by potential alternative
  uses as fodder and fuel. Intensification of systems with previously low use
  of purchased inputs (e.g., fertilizer, improved varieties, pesticides) may involve
  increased use of these inputs and/or intensive management using biological inputs
  (e.g., crop rotations, cover crops, manures). Where the use of purchased inputs
  is already high, intensification implies increased efficiency (and potentially
  reduced use) of fertilizer, pesticide, and other inputs. The principal means
  by which intensification influences soil carbon changes are through the amount
  and quality of carbon returned to soil (via roots, crop residues, and manures)
  and through water and nutrient influences on decomposition (Paustian <i>et al.</i>,
  2000a). Agricultural intensification can occur on all or nearly all of the world's
  existing cropland (1.6 Bha). </p>
<p><b>Current Knowledge and Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  The rates of SOC sequestration by agriculture intensification differ among soils
  and ecoregions. The influence of these practices on productivity and soil properties,
  including organic matter dynamics, has been studied for many decades; there
  is an extensive body of research results and many well-documented, long-term
  field studies around the world (Powlson <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Uncertainties
  remain, however, regarding the interactions between different practices (e.g.,
  crop rotations, water table management, fertilization) for different soil and
  climate conditions. </p>
<p><b>Methods</b><br>
  Rates of soil carbon sequestration can be established for predominant cropping/management
  systems on the basis of long-term benchmark experiments, on-site sampling, and
  modeling (e.g., Powlson <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Eve <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Annual
  statistics on cropland area and crop production are available globally at the
  country level (e.g., FAO, IGBP-DIS), and more detailed data on crop production
  and the extent and distribution of the practices described above exist to varying
  degrees for all Annex I countries and many non-Annex I countries. Several generalized
  models of carbon cycling in agricultural systems exist (see <a href="038.htm">Chapter
  2</a>). Quantification of soil carbon changes can be estimated, using models,
  from the distribution of major cropping systems, data on production and residue
  returns, and associated soil and climate information, and/or with soil sampling
  designs. Scaling from local to regional to national levels can be done by using
  a combination of climate and soil maps, management and yield data, modeling,
  and geographic information systems (GIS). </p>
<p><b>Time Scale </b><br>
  These practices can increase soil carbon stocks for 25-50 years or until saturation
  is reached. </p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, and Transparency </b><br>
  The amount of new carbon sequestration and its residence time (turnover rate)
  can be verified through ground truthing (on-site sampling) and well-calibrated
  models. Periodic monitoring can be done by using benchmark sites where SOC content
  and bulk density can be measured once every 5-10 years to a depth of 1 m. Because
  of the stratification of SOC, soil samples need to be taken in small depth increments
  in the surface layers. The practices to be used are well characterized. </p>
<p><b>Removals</b><br>
  Reversion to conventional agriculture practices (i.e., plowing, residue removal
  or burning, inappropriate irrigation, improper fertilizer use) can cause the
  loss of sequestered carbon. </p>
<p><b>Permanence</b><br>
  Most carbon in agricultural systems is in the soil and has residence times of
  years to centuries (see <a href="161.htm">Section 4.2</a>). </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  Agriculture intensification has numerous ancillary benefits-the most important
  of which is the increase and maintenance of food production. Environmental benefits
  can include erosion control, water conservation, improved water quality, and
  reduced siltation of reservoirs and waterways. Soil and water quality is adversely
  affected by indiscriminate use of agriculture inputs and irrigation water. Where
  intensification involves increased use of nitrogen fertilizers, fossil energy
  use will increase, as may N<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions. </p>
<p><b>Relationship to IPCC Guidelines </b><br>
  These practices relate directly to the "Input Factors" used in the IPCC Guidelines
  for estimates of changes in soil carbon stocks. Default values for three levels
  of plant residue production and addition to soil are provided in the Workbook,
  with examples describing the types of management systems that each level would
  correspond to. </p>
