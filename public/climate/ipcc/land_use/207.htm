<h3>4.5.3. Global Scenarios for Biomass Energy </h3>
<p>Recent scenario studies (Hall <i>et al.</i>, 2000) show biomass energy contributing
  150-200 EJ yr<sup>-1</sup> by 2050, avoiding CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions of ~3.5 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>-more than
  half of present fossil fuel emissions. Previous global energy scenarios show
  a rising trend for biofuel use, at small or no additional cost, with Latin America
  and Africa becoming large net exporters of liquid biofuels. WEC (1993) projects
  62 EJ in 2020, plus traditional wood fuel in developing countries; IEA (1998)
  projects that biomass fuels will grow at 1.2 percent per year to 60 EJ in 2020;
  Lazarus <i>et al.</i> (1993) project 91 EJ in 2030; Dupont-Roc <i>et al.</i>
  (1996) showed a business-as-usual scenario for Shell International with 221
  EJ-of which 179 EJ were from fuel plantations-in 2060. The Global Energy Perspectives'
  high-growth, high-biomass scenario has 316 EJ of biomass by 2100 (Nakicenovic
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Without arguing these and other numerical scenarios, the
  common vision is that there is a large and increasing potential for biofuels
  (see Fact Sheet 4.21 for land-use implications). </p>
<p>Under its Biofuel Activity Program, the International Energy Agency (IEA) monitors
  a wide range of commercial and near-commercial processes, many of which use
  small-scale plants for converting biofuel into heat, light, and transportation
  fuels (Overend and Chornet, 1999; Rosillo-Calle <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Walter
  (2000) reviews new technology. Large sunk costs in long-lived capital stock
  and infrastructure impedes market entry for renewable energy. Biofuel is relatively
  compatible, however, with the fossil fuel-based energy systems (e.g., blending
  with petroleum products, wood chips with coal at power stations). Modern biofuel
  is efficient at small scales (e.g., in rural areas and developing countries).
</p>
<h3><a name="s4-5-4"></a>4.5.4. Land Availability </h3>
<p>In general, land availability (out of the very large area that might be used)
  will be influenced by its value (opportunity cost) in the variety of services
  that land provides, from wilderness through food production to urban occupation,
  as well as by its biomass productivity. The potential for increased production
  of biofuels can be accomplished through increased use of existing forest and
  other land resources, higher rates of plant productivity, and more efficient
  conversion processes and capture of wastes. </p>
<p>Unmanaged woody species have yields of less than 5 t ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (dry weight
  biomass). Optimal management and planting of selected species and clones on
  appropriate soils currently achieves 10-15 t ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in temperate areas and
  15-25 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the tropics; 40 t C ha yr<sup>-1</sup> has been obtained with <i>Eucalyptus</i>
  in Brazil and Ethiopia. High yields (30-40 dry t ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) are also possible
  with herbaceous crops such as switchgrass (Hall et al., 1992). In Brazil, the
  average annual yield of sugar cane has risen from 28 to 39 t ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (dry
  weight) over 15 years, with more than 70 t ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> achieved in Hawaii, southern
  Africa, and Queensland (FAO, 1999). </p>
<p>There are large areas of deforested and degraded lands in tropical countries
  that could produce multiple benefits from the establishment of biofuel plantations
  (Brown, 1998). Conversion of these and other lands to biofuel plantations can
  provide economic value to the local people. Large-scale biofuel production will
  require specific energy crops, improved land management, species selection and
  mixes, genetic engineering, and so forth. </p>
