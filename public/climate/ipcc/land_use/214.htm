<h4>4.6.3.1. Change in Carbon Stocks in 1990 as the Reference</h4>
<p>For CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions from fossil fuel combustion and most other categories of
  emissions from Annex I countries, the Kyoto Protocol would require that Parties
  reduce emissions by some specified amount below emissions levels in 1990. (We
  note for completeness that some countries are in fact permitted an increase
  in emissions and that, for some countries and some GHGs, an alternate reference
  year is permitted.) In application to Article 3.4, this requirement would suggest
  that the carbon stock change during the commitment period be compared with the
  carbon stock change during the base period (1990). </p>
<p>In mathematical terms, the change in stocks over time is equal to net emissions,
  so net emissions are the first derivative of the stocks (the first derivative
  of stocks gives the rate at which stocks are changing). The change in net emissions
  over time is the second derivative of stocks, which indicates the rate at which
  net emissions are changing. The opening line of Article 3.3 suggests that, in
  fact, the second derivative of stocks is of interest; this phrase conflicts
  with later portions of Article 3.3, however, and has now been officially rendered
  meaningless by a decision at COP4 interpreting Article 3.3 (UNFCCC, 1998b).
  Nonetheless, some observers believe that our interest should be in the second
  derivative of stocks. This conflict has been referred to as the "gross-net disparity"
  (IGBP, 1998). </p>
<p>For Parties to whom Article 3.7 applies (i.e., Parties for whom land-use change
  and forestry constituted a net source of GHG emissions in 1990), aggregate emissions
  and sinks from land-use change in 1990 are to be included in the 1990 reference.
  Subtraction of base-year emissions from commitment-year emissions then yields
  a true measure of the change in net GHG emissions from the base period to the
  commitment period if the same list of activities is included in both calculations-limited
  by the "since 1990" stipulation. If the change in carbon stocks in 1990 (or
  other base year) is not taken as the reference for Article 3.4 activities, and
  if some of the activities brought in under Article 3.4 were significant sources
  of GHG emissions in the base year, a qualification such as that in Article 3.7
  might be considered. If some of these Article 3.4 activities are defined as
  land-use changes, Article 3.7 may be interpreted to apply. </p>
<p>One of the procedural problems with this approach has to do with year-to-year
  variability in the natural part of the global carbon cycle, particularly in
  the terrestrial biosphere (see <a href="014.htm">Chapter 1</a>). Another difficulty is that retrospectively
  determining the rate of change in some stocks may not be technically feasible-restricting
  this approach to application only in the future. Although this approach was
  rejected in Kyoto, it would most nearly treat emissions from the biosphere in
  the same way that emissions from fossil fuel burning are treated, while retaining
  the linkage to carbon stocks. </p>
<p>Another issue that has been raised with regard to this approach is the possibility
  that best efforts could still result in a net rate of removals that shrinks
  with time. As an activity continues over time, it could use all of the land
  available (conservation tillage, for example, might become adopted on virtually
  all cropland) and/or begin to fill up the ecologically available carbon stocks
  (a soil achieves a general equilibrium at a certain SOC level, or a large region
  of forests matures and growth rates decline); thus, the rate of change would
  begin to decline compared to an earlier period. This issue may be more immediately
  germane to project-level accounting-which is more likely to contain a few soil
  situations or ecosystem successional phases-but it could become important at
  the Party level if aggressive implementation of effective activities were continued
  for several decades. The result is that a Party with a declining rate of carbon
  sequestration would appear to be a source from an accounting standpoint even
  though it was a net carbon sink. </p>
