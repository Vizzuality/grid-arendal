<h4>4.4.7.4. Verification </h4>
<p>At a scale greater than a few hectares, land restoration generally can be verified
  by remote sensing. A change in vegetation or in the density of vegetation is
  usually apparent; where it can be made quantitative, the effectiveness of the
  restoration can be assessed. Carbon gains associated with the new vegetation
  may be modeled with acceptable accuracy at this scale (except, perhaps, in very
  toxic soils). Confirmation requires field sampling of soil carbon and aboveground
  biomass. </p>
<h3><a name="s4-4-8"></a>4.4.8. Urban and Peri-Urban Land Management </h3>
<p>Improving land management in urban and peri-urban areas can affect stocks of
  carbon through additions to aboveground and below-ground biomass in areas where
  grass and trees can be grown. Urban forests-in the form of trees and other greenery-constitute
  a major amenity feature of urban areas, but they are also elements of the urban
  ecosystem: They moderate air temperatures and water runoff, clean pollutants
  from low-level air, and provide wildlife habitat in addition to sequestering
  carbon (McPherson <i>et al.</i>, 1997). In Tokyo, with its high population densities,
  the proportion of green coverage is 23 percent; in Vienna, a city known for
  its open areas, the proportion is 50 percent. </p>
<p>Rapid expansion of urban areas is occurring in the United States: Urban expansion
  of approximately 1.34 Mha yr<sup>-1</sup> was recorded in the period 1992-1997, of which
  around 0.5 Mha was converted from forest (USDA-NRCS, 1999). Conversion of forest
  to urban development may remove only a portion of the forest cover (unless the
  development includes large buildings or solid hard surface), but there are few
  data to help estimate the amount of carbon loss that might be associated with
  the activity for activity-based carbon flux estimates. </p>
<p>Urban areas around the world generally exhibit a "heat island" effect that
  makes the center of the city warmer than its surrounding rural regions (Akbari
  <i>et al.</i>, 1989, 1992). This effect increases the demand for energy for
  cooling, which typically is provided by fossil fuels. Urban vegetation, particularly
  urban trees, is an important factor in reducing urban heat build-up, reducing
  the energy demand and thus saving fossil fuels. Studies in the United States
  indicate that the daily electrical usage for air-conditioning could be reduced
  by 10-50 percent by properly locating trees and shrubs (Akbari <i>et al.</i>,
  1992). Although these fossil fuel savings will be accounted for elsewhere, the
  net carbon store in increased urban vegetation is not. A 10-year program aimed
  at increasing the canopy cover by 10 percent on residential lands and 5-20 percent
  on other urban lands in the United States could result in sequestration of 3-9
  Mt C yr<sup>-1</sup> in trees and soils and a 7-29 Mt C reduction in emissions as a result
  of energy conservation from improved shading, increased evapotranspiration,
  and reduction of the urban heat island, along with wintertime heat savings (Sampson
  <i>et al.</i>, 1992). </p>
<p>Improving urban trees also contributes to the reduction of ozone formation
  through their effect on lowering urban heat island temperatures. Ozone in the
  lower atmosphere is an important GHG as well as a threat to human health. Mitigating
  the heat island effect is important in reducing the formation of ozone in the
  lower atmosphere. Rosenfeld <i>et al.</i> (1996) estimated that, for the city
  of Los Angeles, a program of tree planting and installing cooler roofing and
  pavement products could reduce by 12 percent the number of days when ozone levels
  exceed health standards, with half of the benefit coming from trees and the
  other half from increased reflection of incoming solar radiation during summer
  months. </p>
<p>Trees contribute to ozone formation by emitting volatile organic compounds
  (VOC) in the presence of NO<span class="subscript">X</span> (largely from automobile exhaust); they also "scrub"
  ozone from city air. Because these VOC emissions-which generally constitute
  less than 10 percent of total VOC emissions in urban areas (Nowak, 1991)-are
  temperature-dependent, increased urban tree cover is believed to lower overall
  VOC and therefore reduce ozone formation (Cardelino and Chameides, 1990). Nowak
  (1994) found that Chicago's urban forest was removing 2,000 t O<span class="subscript">3</span> yr<sup>-1</sup> from that
  city's atmosphere. </p>
