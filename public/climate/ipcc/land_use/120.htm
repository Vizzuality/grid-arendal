<h3>Country, Regional, and Global ARD Potentials </h3>
<p>If definitions of ARD include the harvest/regeneration cycle and stock changes
  are accounted over the full commitment period (land-based approach I), the reported
  carbon stock change in the commitment period will be negative for many Annex
  I countries. Debits will exceed credits, except in regions with forests that
  mature very quickly. If carbon accounting does not start before the start of
  the activity (land-based approach II or activity-based approach), reported carbon
  stock changes will be positive for most Annex I countries if only biomass is
  considered. Land-based approach II is likely to yield carbon debits initially
  if changes in dead organic matter and soil organic matter pool are also considered,
  as demonstrated in stand- and landscape-level examples. </p>
<p>The Temperate and Boreal Forest Resource Assessment 2000 (TBFRA 2000) (UN,
  1999) provides estimates on area of extension of forest and natural colonization
  of forest and other wooded land that could be regarded as non-forest to forest
  change in all definitional scenarios. TBFRA 2000 provides areas of regeneration
  after harvest that could be regarded as reforestation in the FAO scenario. Estimates
  for annual loss to other uses, obtained from an earlier FAO report, could be
  regarded as deforestation in all definitional scenarios. Annex I countries have
  reported a regeneration area that was 14 times larger than the area of extension
  of the forest, and loss to other uses was approximately three times the extension
  of forest, with the consequence that deforestation dominates net changes in
  carbon stocks to be reported under Article 3.3. Some countries have not reported
  extension or regeneration of forest, nor losses to other uses. Because the terms
  and definitions in TBFRA 2000 do not fully correspond to the terms and definitions
  of ARD used here, there is additional uncertainty associated with these ARD
  estimates. </p>
<p>The maximum amount of carbon that can be sequestered by global afforestation
  and reforestation activities (IPCC Scenario) is 60-87 Gt C on 344 Mha between
  1995 and 2050, with 70 percent in tropical forests, 25 percent in temperate
  forests, and 5 percent in boreal forests. The average annual carbon sequestration
  rate would be 1.1-1.6 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>. The actual rate would be lower in the first
  commitment period (0.5 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> above and below ground after 20 years of growth)
  because a large proportion of the forests established since 1990 would still
  be in a juvenile stage.</p>
<p>National studies indicate that change from non-forest to forest could provide
  credits on the order of 1-2 percent of 1990 CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions in most Annex I countries
  and up to 50 or 100 percent for countries with low population density and substantial
  afforestation programs. Reforestation under the FAO scenario could contribute
  additional debits of up to 27 percent of 1990 CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions for some countries
  with large reforested areas and relatively slow regrowth, if land-based accounting
  approach I is used. It could provide a credit of up to 25 percent when stock
  changes are calculated between reforestation and the end of the commitment period,
  if the effects of decaying slash are excluded (activity-based approach). Deforestation
  could contribute debits of up to 3 percent of 1990 CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions. </p>
