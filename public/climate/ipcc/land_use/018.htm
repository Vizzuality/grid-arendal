<h2>1.2. Biogeochemical Cycles of Greenhouse Gases </h2>
<p>Terrestrial ecosystems are important components in the biogeochemical cycles
  that create many of the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous
  oxide and thereby influence global responses to human-induced emissions of greenhouse
  gases (GHGs). The dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems depend on interactions
  between a variety of biogeochemical cycles, particularly the carbon cycle, the
  nutrient cycles, and the circulation of water-all of which may be modified indirectly
  by climate changes and by direct human actions (e.g., land-use/cover change).
</p>
<h3><a name="s1-2-1"></a>1.2.1. The Global Carbon Cycle</h3>
<h4><a name="s1-2-1-1"></a>1.2.1.1. Natural and Human-Induced Changes in the Past
  Carbon Cycle </h4>
<p>Analyses of air bubbles in ice cores from Greenland and the Antarctic have
  given us a reasonably clear idea about variations in atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration
  since the end of the last glacial maximum. It was then about 200 ppmv; it rose
  gradually to about 250 ppmv 8,000 years ago and subsequently by 25 ppmv during
  the following 7,000 years. During the past millennium until the beginning of
  the industrial revolution, CO<span class="subscript">2</span> varied between 275 and 285 ppmv. There seems
  to have been an increase of about 10 ppmv around 1300 AD, followed by a 10 ppmv
  decrease around 1600 AD (i.e., during the Little Ice Age) (Barnola <i>et al.</i>,
  1995; Etheridge <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Indermühle <i>et al.</i>, 1999). All of
  these changes took place gradually, and the rate of change in the atmospheric
  reservoir probably seldom exceeded a few Gt C per decade (Ciais, 1999). </p>
<p>The CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration has risen from the range noted above to a concentration
  of 366 ppmv in 1998 (Keeling and Whorf, 1999). The decadal rate of change over
  the past century has been persistent and more rapid than during any other period
  in the last millennium. This rate of change can be explained by the cumulative
  effects of emissions from fossil fuel combustion and land clearing and the response
  of the oceans and biosphere to this anthropogenic perturbation. </p>
<p>From 1850 to 1998, 270 ± 30 Gt C were emitted from fossil fuel burning and
  cement production (Marland <i>et al.</i>, 1999); 176 ± 10 Gt C accumulated in
  the atmosphere (Etheridge <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Keeling and Whorf, 1999). The
  cumulative ocean uptake during this time has been estimated (with the aid of
  ocean carbon cycle models) to be 120 ± 50 Gt C (Kheshgi <i>et al.</i>, 1999;
  Joos <i>et al.</i>, 1999). This estimate of ocean uptake is more uncertain than
  estimates of total emissions from fossil fuel burning and the accumulation in
  the atmosphere (Siegenthaler and Joos, 1992; Enting <i>et al.</i>, 1994). Nevertheless,
  balancing the carbon budget for this period yields a global net terrestrial
  source of about 26 ± 60 Gt C. In other words, it is likely that the terrestrial
  system has been a source during this period. </p>
<p>It is relevant to compare the magnitude of this global net terrestrial source
  with direct estimates of emissions during this time resulting from the expansion
  of cropland, deforestation, and other land-use changes (see <a href="033.htm#s1-4-1">Section
  1.4.1</a>). The area covered by cropland in temperate regions (particularly
  in North America and the former Soviet Union) reached a maximum by the middle
  of the 20th century (Ramankutty and Foley, 1998). The rate of increase of croplands
  in tropical regions (mainly Latin America), however, surpassed that of temperate
  regions around 1960 (Houghton, 1994, 1999). </p>
<p>During the period 1850-1998, net cumulative global CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions from land-use
  change are estimated to have been 136 ± 55 Gt C (assuming that the relative
  uncertainty of land-use change emissions is the same as the estimate for the
  1980s). Of these emissions, about 87 percent were from forest areas and about
  13 percent from cultivation of mid-latitude grasslands (Houghton, 1999; Houghton
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999, 2000). A residual global terrestrial sink of 110 ± 80 Gt
  C is therefore required to reconcile the difference between the net terrestrial
  source estimated by balancing the carbon budget (26 ± 60 Gt C) and the larger
  terrestrial source estimated by accounting for the effects land-use change on
  carbon stocks (136 ± 55 Gt C). Thus, this residual terrestrial carbon sink-popularly
  referred to as the "missing carbon sink"-was comparable in size to the net ocean
  uptake over this period. </p>
