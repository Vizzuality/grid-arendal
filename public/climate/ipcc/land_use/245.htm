<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.22. Energy By-Products from Food and Fiber Wastes
</h3>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  Biomass waste products arising from traditional agricultural and forest production,
  and processing contributes significantly to the energy mix (Hall, 1991; Pingoud
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Hall <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Resources include rice husks,
  corn cobs, cereal straw, bagasse, wood process residues (bark, sawdust, off-cuts),
  black liquor, nut shells, animal manures, and municipal solid wastes. A wide
  range of energy conversion routes exist to produce electricity, heat, or fuels
  (landfill gas, biogas, producer gas, ethanol, methanol, briquetted pellets,
  charcoal, etc.). Currently, a significant proportion of biomass waste at food
  and fiber processing plants is either burned to waste or dumped into landfills
  for disposal. Where this dumping entails a disposal cost, use of the resource
  for energy production may be economically feasible and reduce the possibility
  of local air and water pollution. </p>
<p><b>Monitoring and Verification </b><br>
  The resource is widely distributed, highly variable, and difficult to assess
  with any degree of accuracy. It tends to have a low energy density and high
  moisture content. In countries with extensive forest industries-such as Sweden,
  Finland, and Austria-energy from woody biomass by-products can be monitored
  relatively easily and can supply up to 30 percent of the country's primary energy.
  In developing countries with dispersed rural populations, use of biomass wastes
  for cooking and heating can only be estimated. </p>
<p><b>Removals</b><br>
  Agricultural and forest production wastes are traditionally left in the field
  after harvest to decompose; hence, these wastes return organic matter and nutrients
  to the soil and carbon to the atmosphere. Sustainable production methods would
  need to be carefully evaluated for each site and soil type if this biomass were
  to be removed from the site along with the traditional food and fiber products.
  Conversely, removal of these waste by-products (straw, logging slash, etc.)
  may have benefits-such as ease of cultivation and replanting, disease control,
  and avoiding methane production during natural decomposition. Because of the
  importance of organic residues to the maintenance of soil quality, it has been
  suggested that only about 50 percent of agricultural residues can be removed
  from fields without affecting future crop productivity (Sampson <i>et al.</i>,
  1993). </p>
<p><b>Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  Waste-to-energy plants that produce biofuels or generate heat and electricity
  may create local emission problems relating to heavy metals, dioxins, and so
  forth, depending on their design and operation, as well as the nature of the
  biomass. For example, considerable debate continues about the benefits of incineration
  of municipal solid waste and sewage sludge (e.g., Aumonier, 1996) versus disposal
  to properly designed landfills after increased diversion of the organic component
  to composting facilities or anaerobic digestors (e.g., Finnveden and Ekvall,
  1998). If GHG emissions reduction is the primary objective, incineration with
  energy recovery may be preferred. When other economic and environmental factors
  are also considered, there may be no general solution. </p>
<p>Collection and transport of biomass by-products such as cereal straw and forest
  residues to a central processing plant are energy-intensive. Full life-cycle
  analyses need to be undertaken and energy ratios evaluated. </p>
<p><b>Time Scales </b><br>
  Many commercial waste-to-energy plants are already being operated successfully.
  Bagasse is used for on-site co-generation and electricity exports in Australia,
  South Africa, and Hawaii. Cereal straw is used for district heating in Denmark,
  Germany, and the United Kingdom. Wood processing residues are used in the United
  States, Australasia, and northern Europe. Landfill gas plants are widely distributed
  in most developed countries. Community-scale biogas plants are gaining in popularity
  in Denmark, India, and China. Several power plants that burn chicken litter
  are operating in the United Kingdom. Development of further plants depends on
  local energy prices and government strategies for waste avoidance and carbon
  trading. </p>
