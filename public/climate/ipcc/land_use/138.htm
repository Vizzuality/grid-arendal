<h3>3.4.1. Identification of ARD Activities </h3>
<p>Regarding the determination of the area of ARD land, there are fundamentally
  two sources of information available: reports of activities (in countries where
  such reports exist) and monitoring of forest/non-forest change. </p>
<p>The activity reporting approach assumes that a well-defined set of human activities
  will determine ARD land and that information about these activities will be
  reliably reported and compiled. In some countries, for example, conversion of
  forest requires some form of legal permission. Because afforestation and reforestation
  activities require investments, it should be possible to create incentives for
  reporting of activities that would benefit the national carbon balance. An activity
  reporting approach is best if the ARD activities are well defined and are limited
  to changes to and from forest (e.g., the Land Use scenario) rather than changes
  within forest classes. An activity reporting approach cannot meet the data requirements
  for scenarios that include a transition from one forest class to another (e.g.,
  the Degradation/Aggradation scenario). </p>
<p>Several techniques are available for monitoring forest/non-forest change. The
  simplest method is to identify the total area considered forest in 1990 and
  at the end of the commitment period. This information might be collected through
  independent samples at two points in time. A net increase in forest area represents
  an excess of afforestation and reforestation over deforestation; a net decline
  represents the reverse. This technique does not follow the fate of individual
  forest stands. Thus, it allows deforestation to the extent that it is compensated
  by afforestation and reforestation. A zero net change in forest area can be
  achieved by deforesting and afforesting the same amount of area. Because the
  two activities would be expected to contain very different carbon stocks per
  hectare, however, the zero net change in area would not result in a zero net
  change in carbon stocks. Therefore, an alternative technique that avoids this
  problem would be to identify specifically which areas were afforested, reforested,
  or deforested during the time period. </p>
<p>ARD activities can be monitored in a variety of ways. The two predominant methods
  are field sampling and remote sensing. These techniques are described in more
  detail in <a href="077.htm">Section 2.4</a>; both involve sampling the land
  (with either field plots or aerial/ orbital images) at multiple points in time
  and subsequently identifying locations (or sample plots) where land-use or land-cover
  changes indicate that ARD activities have occurred. ARD activities could be
  identified by an assessment of forest extent in 1990 and in 2012; those areas
  that change from forest to non-forest or from non-forest to forest during this
  interval could be deemed to have undergone an ARD event. An assessment conducted
  only at the endpoints of this interval, however, may miss many ARD events that
  could result in changes in carbon stocks. For example, a 1990 forest that is
  deforested in 1991, only to be reforested in 2010, is in forest condition at
  both interval endpoints, yet it may be counted as ARD land. </p>
