<h4>2.4.3.3. Continental Scales </h4>
<p>Terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon (fluxes) can be estimated over very
  large areas by combining two types of information: spatial and temporal variations
  in atmospheric concentrations of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and models of atmospheric mixing or transport.
  At present, there are roughly 100 sites routinely operated by a few air sampling
  networks. Most measurement sites are located in the marine boundary layer, however-far
  from the direct influence of continental ecosystems. Better sampling of the
  continental air sheds is critical to reduce current uncertainties about terrestrial
  carbon sources and sinks. One also must make measurements through the air column
  to integrate the fluxes of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> from ecosystems over a large spatial domain,
  typically between 100 and 1,000 km. CO<span class="subscript">2</span> measurement by very high television
  towers (Bakwin <i>et al.</i>, 1995) and aircraft (Choularton <i>et al.</i>,
  1995) appear to represent the most practical solutions to pursue that goal.
</p>
<p>Atmospheric transport models are based on wind fields that are derived from
  numerical climate models or weather forecast models. Large-scale mathematical
  inversions of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> data with these models provide an estimate of the net flux
  of carbon from all surface processes. These models cannot be applied to determine
  the carbon exchange for projects, and, in general, they cannot be used to attribute
  fluxes to specific activities. </p>
<p>Recent analyses show conflicting results in apportioning CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fluxes over the
  continents. A debated issue is the partitioning of the Northern Hemisphere terrestrial
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> flux among North America, Europe, and Asia. For example, a study by Fan
  <i>et al.</i> (1998) found most of the northern mid-latitude sink in North America,
  whereas Bousquet <i>et al.</i> (1999) found most of it in Asia. The high estimate
  for North America is also inconsistent with analyses that are based on land-use
  change and forest inventories (Houghton <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>Current inversion analyses depend to some extent on a priori knowledge about
  surface fluxes and patterns of atmospheric transport. Thus, one must verify
  carefully that the solution is mostly constrained by atmospheric observations
  via the atmospheric transport, not by any of the model's artifacts. The current
  generation of inverse models of the global carbon cycle can generate intriguing
  hypotheses regarding the possible location of regional carbon fluxes, but these
  models are insufficiently constrained to be reliable for specific activities
  or inventory purposes. This situation is unlikely to change dramatically within
  the next decade, but in the longer term, inverse modeling in conjunction with
  large-scale flux measurements may pass from the research into the operational
  arena. </p>
<p>In summary, there are a range of flux measurement and flux estimation methodologies
  under active development that can be expected to improve the ability to determine
  average net surface fluxes over a range of spatial scales for CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  GHGs. In some cases, isotopic information can be used to partition fluxes between
  different source types (e.g., fossil fuel vs. biotic sources). Methods that
  are applicable at regional and larger scales are not expected to provide a basis
  for CO<span class="subscript">2</span> flux estimation that is useful for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol
  in the first commitment period. Nevertheless, information from these larger
  scale methods can provide constraints on total surface fluxes that may be useful
  for full carbon accounting and for validating process-based models of GHG fluxes.
