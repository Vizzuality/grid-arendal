<h3>5.6.4. Transfer and Local Adaptation of Technology</h3>
<p>For LULUCF projects, technology adaptation, diffusion, and transfer requires
  a broad definition. Such transfer may include sustainable forest management
  practices; forest conservation and protected area management systems; silvicultural
  practices for afforestation and reforestation programs; genetically superior
  planting material; efficient harvesting, processing, and end-use technologies;
  indigenous knowledge of forest conservation; and low-tillage agriculture and
  ruminant management practices (Ravindranath <i>et al.</i>, 2000).</p>
<p>Most LULUCF projects require the transfer of such technology. The absence of
  these technologies may frustrate delivery of the mitigation and developmental
  benefits associated with them (Sathaye <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Poorly designed
  LULUCF projects may lead to the importation of inadequate or inappropriate technologies
  into recipient countries. In agroforestry projects, for example, inappropriate
  selection of species and crop timbering processes or machinery may fail to bring
  out the full potential of associated co-benefits, which depend on local biophysical,
  social, cultural, and organizational factors (Lemaster, 1995). </p>
<p>Current and emerging pathways and mechanisms for technology transfer through
  LULUCF GHG mitigation projects have several limitations-namely, limited financial
  resources, inadequate information on costs and potential benefits of projects,
  limited host country technical capacity, absence of policies and institutions
  to process and evaluate mitigation projects, and long gestation periods. In
  addition, the forest sector faces land-use regulation and other policies that
  favor conversion to other land uses, such as agriculture and cattle ranching.
  Insecure land tenure and subsidies that favor agriculture or livestock are among
  the most important barriers to ensuring sustainable forest management and sustainability
  of GHG mitigation (Ravindranath <i>et al.</i>, 2000).</p>
<p>LULUCF projects have surmounted some of these barriers through means that include
  extensive capacity building and establishing institutions at the local level
  (e.g., NKCAP, Bolivia; Scolel-Te, Mexico); development of improved forest management
  systems and joint ventures between private companies and local organizations
  (RIL, Malaysia); and systems of financial incentives that directly benefit farmers
  by increasing the relative cost-effectiveness of forestry options (Costa Rica
  Joint Implementation Program) (see <a href="251.htm#box5-1">Box 5-1</a>). LULUCF
  projects in non-Annex I countries have the potential to fund improved technologies
  that can yield environmental benefits by raising agricultural productivity through
  the transfer of irrigation or management practices; increasing milling efficiency;
  improving silvicultural practices; promoting sustainable forest management (Brown,
  1998), as in Senegal (<a href="#box5-6">Box 5-6</a>); or-where LULUCF projects
  involve biofuel production-supporting energy sector development that "leap-frogs"
  the fossil fuel stage, moving directly to sustainable energy development (Read,
  1999). </p>

      <td>Enda Syspro, an international institution, has developed an ecologically
	sustainable agroforestry practice in Senegal. This system involves planting
	hedges in the boundary of the fields with drip irrigation to produce various
	crops and vegetables for local markets and exports. This type of project
	improves food security which has been considered the primary concern of
	African countries at the 1999 Abidjan, Ivory Coast, meeting for climate
	change. The agroforestry project not only reduces GHG emissions (by avoiding
	deforestation, sequestering carbon in hedges and soils, and replacing
	fossil fuels with sustainably harvested firewood), it also improves soil
	fertility and reduces soil erosion. The project maintains biodiversity
	by reducing deforestation and fragmentation of the landscape. By reducing
	the need for water for irrigation, it helps to reduce vulnerability to
	climate change in the Sahelian countries. A training center has been set
	up for Senegal and Sahelian countries to replicate such farming systems.
	Various high-technology agricultural activities, including biotechnology
	transfer, have been developed in Enda Spyro to improve food security and
	to measure carbon sequestration. Today, more than 1,000 ha of such agroforestry
	systems have been established in Senegal.</td>
