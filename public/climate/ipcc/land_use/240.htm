<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.17. Low-Impact Forest Harvesting </h3>
<p>Low-impact harvesting entails harvesting methods that are developed and executed
  to provide minimum disturbance to soil, remaining vegetation, and extracted
  trees. The practice influences the carbon stock change from trees left in the
  forest after harvest, as well as the growth (and corresponding carbon storage)
  of new trees and vegetation. It also influences carbon storage in end products
  by influencing timber quality and affecting the type of utilization that can
  be made of the timber. </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  Winjum <i>et al.</i> (1998) estimate regional and global harvest volumes and
  corresponding carbon storage and emission changes. Putz and Pinard (1993) and
  Pinard and Putz (1996, 1997) demonstrate that reduced-impact logging is an activity
  that substantially decreases the emission of carbon in tropical forests because
  of reduced damage to soil and remaining trees. </p>
<p><b>Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  Uncertainties associated with this practice relate to quantification of differences
  between carbon stock changes associated with better practices compared to those
  normally applied in a country or region. Estimates are needed of damage to soil,
  remaining trees, and other vegetation and the consequences of these damages
  for carbon stocks. In addition, regarding damage on extracted trees, estimates
  of the decay time of end products into which harvested timber is manufactured
  are needed. None of these measurements are included in the present IPCC methodology.
  Compiling results from several measurements in different forests may make possible
  the development of benchmarks for typical high-impact logging in different forest
  types and economies. </p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, and Transparency </b><br>
  If the uncertainty factors are adequately met, monitoring and verifying this
  practice should be possible. Assumptions and methodologies associated with this
  practice are easily explained for replication and assessment of impacts. </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  In most cases this practice will have positive environmental benefits regarding
  biodiversity, recreation, and landscape management; no associated environmental
  damage is likely. In addition, this practice is likely to increase the economic
  value of remaining trees, as well as logged trees. Boscolo <i>et al.</i> (1997)
  estimate the cost efficiency of reduced-impact harvesting in a lowland tropical
  rainforest in Malaysia as $5.5 t-1 C. No conflicts are likely. The equity implications
  are small. The main barrier that prevents these activities from being implemented
  is lack of economic incentives. Without some incentives based on carbon impacts,
  costs are likely to remain higher than benefits. </p>
