<h3>4.5.6. Forest Products </h3>
<p>This section presents the opportunities offered by forest products as a recyclable
  store of carbon and a renewable source of fibers for the mitigation of climate
  change. Policy options to account for these wood product pools are discussed
  in <a href="301.htm">Section 6.2.2</a>. </p>
<p>In 1996, the world's forests produced 3.4 billion m<sup>3</sup> of harvested roundwood.
  About 1.9 billion m<sup>3</sup> (56 percent) of this harvest was fuelwood; the remainder
  (1.5 billion m<sup>3</sup>) was industrial roundwood (e.g., sawlogs and pulpwood). The
  industrial roundwood corresponds to a harvesting flux of about 0.3 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>.
  Developed countries account for 70 percent of total world production and consumption
  of industrial wood products (FAO, 1999). </p>
<p>The timber that is harvested is converted into a wide variety of wood products
  (Skog and Nicholson, 1998). The carbon in the wood is fixed in products until
  they decay or are burned (i.e., for energy production) and the carbon is subsequently
  released back into the atmosphere. Models are available to assist in developing
  estimates of carbon fate in wood products, depending on their initial size,
  quality, and industrial utilization (Row and Phelps, 1996; Apps <i>et al.</i>,
  1999b). With increasing industrial use of wood, the amount of carbon fixed in
  wood products will raise proportionally. There are several ways to positively
  influence the carbon balance: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Shifting the product mix to a greater proportion of wood products.</i>
    Manufacturing and transport of wood products requires less fossil fuel than
    energy-intensive construction materials such as aluminum, steel, and concrete
    (Matthews <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Recent comparisons show that the production
    of steel and concrete as building material requires up to two times more energy
    than wood-based product-with concomitant greater generation of GHGs. Increased
    use of solid timber, engineered wood and wood-based panels, paper, and fuels
    displaces energy-intensive materials (cement, steel, bricks, and plastics)
    in two main ways. On one hand, it increases the amount of carbon stored in
    wood products, particularly those with long life spans. On the other hand,
    it reduces emissions during production processes. The use of by-products (wood
    fuels) for energy generation in production processes has an additional positive
    impact on the overall carbon balance.</li>
  <li><i> Increasing the useful life of products.</i> Extending the life of wood
    products implies not only a longer service life but a longer carbon sequestration
    period and less energy consumption for their replacement through other new
    materials. The service life of wood products can be extended by using the
    appropriate timber species for particular end uses, applying constructive
    or chemical wood protection against fungi and insect attack, and wise use
    of the products themselves. </li>
  <li><i> Increasing product recycling.</i> Wood and paper products are among
    the most commonly used materials for recycling into new products and fuels.
    Utilization of recovered wood in the paper industry and power plants is a
    good example. In Europe, for example, recovered paper accounts for 40 percent
    of annual paper production and is predicted to increase to 45 percent in the
    future. An increase in the number of times a material is recycled and the
    recycling of more wood and paper products will enhance the storage of carbon
    and reduce emissions. </li>
</ul>
