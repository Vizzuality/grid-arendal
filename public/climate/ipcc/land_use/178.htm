<h4>4.4.3.1. Influencing Degradation Processes </h4>
<p>Up to 71 percent of the world's grasslands are degraded to some extent (Dregne
  <i>et al.</i>, 1991) as a result of overgrazing, salinization, alkalinization,
  acidification, and other processes (Oldeman, 1994). Generally, degradation results
  in reductions in perennial plant cover, increased erosion risk, and loss of
  productive potential. Restoration of vegetation and hence productive capacity
  results in increases in biomass, litter, and soil carbon pools (<a href="177.htm#table4-6">Table
  4-6</a>). There may also be a reduction in the intensity or frequency of water
  and wind erosion, which removes carbon (some of which may be oxidized to CO<span class="subscript">2</span>).
</p>
<p>Wind and water erosion reduce carbon stocks and productivity at the location
  of soil loss. The discussion in <a href="161.htm">Section 4.2</a> of the uncertainty relating to the
  net effect of erosion is relevant here as well. Grazing and burning reduce plant
  cover, thereby increasing soil erosion rates (Scanlan <i>et al.</i>, 1996) and
  carbon loss (e.g., Ash <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Increased erosion can reduce yields
  (Tenberg <i>et al.</i>, 1998) and thus carbon inputs into the soil, which depletes
  soil carbon levels (e.g., Kelly <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Lal, 2000b). Soil conservation
  procedures that restore landscape patchiness (e.g., by using shrub branches
  laid across the slope) can rapidly and substantially increase soil carbon (Tongway
  and Ludwig, 1996). Activities that combat desertification more broadly are also
  likely to result in substantial carbon storage (Fullen and Mitchell, 1994).
</p>
<h4><a name="s4-4-3-2"></a>4.4.3.2. Grazing Management </h4>
<p>Overgrazing is the single greatest cause of degradation in grasslands (Oldeman
  <i>et al.</i>, 1991) and the overriding human-influenced factor in determining
  their soil carbon levels (Ojima <i>et al.</i>, 1993a). Grazing influences carbon
  storage through removal of biomass and nutrients-much of which are recycled
  to soil pools but some of which are lost from the grassland (e.g., Haynes and
  Williams, 1993). Grazing also influences partitioning of carbon to aboveground
  or below-ground plant organs, changes the temperature and disturbance regimes
  of the soil, and alters water infiltration and susceptibility to erosion (Follett
  <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Often, extensive heavy grazing practices result in decreases
  in carbon pools of biomass and soil carbon (e.g., Naeth <i>et al.</i>, 1991;
  Ash <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Li <i>et al.</i>, 1997; McIntosh <i>et al.</i>, 1997a,b).
  Consequently, in many systems, improved grazing management (e.g., optimizing
  stock numbers, rotational grazing) will result in substantial increases in carbon
  pools (e.g., Ash <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Eldridge and Robson, 1997; <a href="177.htm#table4-6">Table
  4-6</a>); in some cases, grazing can increase nutrient cycling, animal productivity
  (e.g., Franzluebbers <i>et al.</i>, 2000), and incorporation of litter into
  the soil-thereby increasing soil carbon (Schuman et al., 1999). Where soil carbon
  has been lost, however, the rate of recovery of carbon may be considerably slower
  than the rate of loss (Northup and Brown, 1999). Additional human intervention
  may be required where degradation is severe. Adoption of more sustainable grazing
  practices that track climate variability and change is likely to reduce the
  risk of degradation and hence carbon loss (McKeon <i>et al.</i>, 1993). </p>
<p>In some grasslands, changes in species composition under grazing toward those
  with large and dense root systems (e.g., <i>Bouteloua gracilis</i>) can increase
  carbon levels in the surface soil layers (Dormaar and Willms, 1990; Frank et
  al., 1995; Manley <i>et al.</i>, 1995; Berg <i>et al.</i>, 1997) but are associated
  with reduced grazing utility. Where such species are already dominant, however,
  heavy grazing will reduce soil carbon levels (Gardner, 1950). In other situations,
  grazing intensity seems to have little or variable impact on soil carbon levels
  (Milchunas and Lauenroth, 1993; Basher and Lynn, 1996; Chaneton and Lavado,
  1996; Brejida, 1997; Tracy and Frank, 1998; McIntosh and Allen, 1998), provided
  overgrazing does not occur. Heavy grazing can increase opportunities for establishment
  of unpalatable woody shrubs, resulting in increased biomass carbon pools but
  lower grazing utility (e.g., Boutton <i>et al.</i>, 1998). </p>
<p>Grazing livestock are significant contributors of methane and nitrous oxide
  globally (accounted for within the IPCC Guidelines), and their wastes can produce
  ammonia (a precursor of oxides of nitrogen and subsequent ozone formation).
  Improvements in the diet of livestock can substantially reduce methane emissions
  per unit intake (Kurihara et al., 1999), but if livestock are fed grain or other
  supplements, the emissions embodied in these feeds must be accounted for. </p>
