<h4>2.4.2.2. Wood Products </h4>
<p>Wood products in use are part of a full forest sector carbon balance. Globally,
  about 3.4 billion m<sup>3</sup> of wood is harvested per year, excluding wood burned on-site
  (FAO, 1997b), and harvest rates are expected to increase at 0.5 percent per
  year (Solberg <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Of the total harvest, about 1.8 billion
  m<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> is fuelwood, mainly from the tropics. Most of the harvest in the boreal
  and temperate zone is industrial roundwood. About one-half to two-thirds of
  the raw wood finds its way into wood products; the rest is used as energy or
  is otherwise lost. The annual production of wood materials therefore corresponds
  to a harvest flux of about 1.6 billion m<sup>3</sup>, translating to a gross flux into
  wood products of about 0.3 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>. </p>
<p>The long-term effectiveness of carbon storage in wood products depends on the
  uses of wood produced through project activities. In projects that stop logging
  (and perhaps those that stop deforestation, if some of the wood cut during deforestation
  entered the wood products market), the change in the wood products pool would
  be negative and would thus offset some of the carbon benefits from the project;
  this effect would have to be accounted for. In plantation projects, wood that
  goes into medium- to long-term products (e.g., sawn timber for housing, particle
  board, paper) represents additional carbon storage. Several (modeling) methods
  exist for accounting for the storage of long-lived wood products; these methods
  have been used to calculate the net changes in stocks in several countries (Pingoud
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Nabuurs and Sikkema, 1998; Skog and Nicholson, 1998; Winjum
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Apps <i>et al.</i>, 1999). These methods account for inputs
  of new products to the pool as well as decay, disposal in landfills, oxidation,
  and retirement of products from past use, accumulated as far back as individual
  country's records allow. An IPCC expert group for the land use and forestry
  sector of the guidelines for GHG inventories completed a report on a description
  and evaluation of the approaches available for estimating carbon emissions or
  removals from forest harvesting and wood products (Lim <i>et al.</i>, 1998).
</p>
<p>If one of the additional activities (see <a href="190.htm#s4-4-5">Section 4.4.5</a>)
  includes carbon in wood products, a method for monitoring changes in the carbon
  of that compartment will be needed. Monitoring of wood products is possible
  through national and international statistics on harvesting and trade. The net
  build-up of carbon in products might be derived from estimates of average lifetimes
  for different wood products. Keeping track of the wood products stemming from
  lands under Article 3.3 or 3.4 will be extremely difficult, however. The only
  practical approach may be to use estimates that are based on data from other
  forests. </p>
