<h4>2.5.1.2. Potential Socioeconomic Impacts of LULUCF Activities and Projects</h4>
<p>This section addresses potential associated impacts on various socioeconomic
  dimensions of sustainable development, including provision of wood products
  and biofuels; agriculture; rural poverty alleviation; and aesthetic, spiritual,
  and recreational values. </p>
<h5><a name="s2-5-1-2-1"></a>2.5.1.2.1. Wood products and biofuels </h5>
<p>The world's forests produced about 3.2 billion m<sup>3</sup> of harvested roundwood in
  1994 and are projected to produce almost 3.7 billion m<sup>3</sup> per year by 2010 (FAO,
  1997b). Of the 1994 total, about 1.7 billion m<sup>3</sup> (53 percent) was used as fuelwood
  and the remainder as industrial roundwood (e.g., sawlogs and pulpwood). Approximately
  half of the fuelwood was produced (and consumed) in Asia, one-quarter in Africa,
  and one-eighth in South America. World industrial roundwood production was concentrated
  in North America (40 percent), Europe (19 percent), Asia (18 percent), and the
  countries of the former Soviet Union (8 percent). </p>
<p>At the global level, forestry was estimated to account for 2 percent of the
  world's gross domestic product (GDP) and 3 percent of international trade. The
  estimated value of wood consumption in 1994 was more than US$400 billion, with
  industrial usage accounting for 75 percent. Several countries are using forest
  products as their main foreign exchange earners; any change in the status of
  forests in these economies is likely to affect their foreign trade and debt
  status (FAO, 1999). Globally, wood is expected to become increasingly scarce
  by 2050, assuming constant per capita wood use and a 2 percent annual volume
  growth increment (Solomon <i>et al.</i>, 1996). The greatest shortfall will
  be in the tropics because of the projected increase in population that drives
  the conversion of forest to agricultural land (Zuidema <i>et al.</i>, 1994).
  There probably will be an associated shortage of fuelwood. </p>
<p>Aggregate temperate zone timber needs are likely to be met over the foreseeable
  future, given current projections of timber supply and demand (see, for instance,
  projections for the United States by Haynes <i>et al.</i>, 1995). Trends in
  the boreal zone are less certain; they depend on the forest response to climate
  change. Climatic changes could lead to increased growth-if anticipated warmer
  conditions allow increase growth-or reduced timber production, if increasing
  incidences of pests, diseases, or fire were to increase tree mortality (Kirschbaum
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Solomon <i>et al.</i>, 1996). </p>
<p>Future changes in climate may affect forest productivity in ways that change
  the level and distribution of global timber supply. Perez-Garcia <i>et al.</i>
  (1997) modeled the effect of alternative climate scenarios on global timber
  markets and found, in general, that the expected rise in net primary productivity
  (NPP) would slightly expand timber supply and reduce timber prices. The net
  welfare effects varied across forest-product consumers and producers, as well
  as by region. Some Parties would benefit from enhanced timber stocks (e.g.,
  consumers and timber importing countries), whereas some stand to lose (producers
  and timber exporting countries). Climatic changes projected by current climatological
  and ecological models may have relatively small effects on timber markets (Burton
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997), but these effects can be quite sensitive to the climatological
  and ecological model used for selection and the extent to which species migration
  is captured (Sohngen and Mendelsohn, 1998; McNulty <i>et al.</i>, 1999). These
  studies do not estimate the effects of climate change on non-timber and non-market
  outputs and therefore do not capture potential effects on biodiversity, watersheds,
  and other forest outputs. Moreover, possible climate change and associated impacts
  should be viewed within the context of many other activities and policies occurring
  in different sectors and possible mitigation responses by humans. </p>
<p>Stand-level analyses have shown that paying landowners to store carbon-although
  it still allows them to harvest timber-can elongate timber rotations significantly
  if carbon is priced sufficiently high (van Kooten <i>et al.</i>, 1995; Hoen
  and Solberg, 1997), though the rotation age response has been found to be lower
  for commercial plantations than for natural forests in the United States (Murray,
  1999). Longer rotations often co-produce environmental benefits, such as improved
  habitat for fauna, but collectively may lead to temporary constraints on aggregate
  timber supply until forests are fully regulated at longer rotation levels. Longer
  rotations and resultant production of larger logs could also result in more
  valuable timber. If forest carbon reserves are created, wherein no harvesting
  activity occurs, the corresponding supply constraint is permanent. Changes in
  timber availability directly affect forest industry employment but must also
  be viewed in the context of other factors that affect forest-based employment,
  such as capital-labor substitution and other forms of technical change. </p>
<p>Establishment of more forests also provides the opportunity to use that wood
  as a biofuel (Nakicenovic <i>et al.</i>, 1996). In some circumstances, forest
  establishment could also decrease deforestation and degradation for fuelwood.
  Greater use of biofuel could also have the advantages of fossil fuel substitution
  by reducing the use of coal, kerosene, liquified petroleum gas (LPG), and so
  forth. Under steady-state conditions, the amount of carbon released through
  combustion of biofuels is offset by the amount of carbon taken up in biomass.
</p>
<p>Establishment of plantations to produce charcoal is one prominent form of biofuel
  production. Plantations for charcoal may have substantial carbon advantages
  over traditional pulpwood plantations because of their ability to substitute
  for fossil fuels (Fearnside, 1995; Schlamadinger and Marland, 1996; Marland
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997). Tree plantations can have mixed effects on the environment,
  depending on the characteristics of the land and the land cover being replaced
  by the plantation, as well as indirect socioeconomic effects through market
  processes. Although the use of biofuels in energy production is highly desirable
  from a carbon management point of view, it may not be without its own social
  and environmental side effects on air quality and waste disposal (Sutton, 1994;
  Fearnside, 1999d). </p>
<p>Savings in the emission of GHGs can also be achieved through material substitution.
  Typical building materials-such as steel, plastics and aluminum-have large energy
  requirements for mining, processing, smelting, and, with some materials, reduction
  of oxidized ore. These energy requirements lead to corresponding CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions.
  Cement production also leads to additional direct CO<span class="subscript">2</span> release during manufacturing.
  Wood leads to the lowest emissions because it requires only minor energy inputs
  in harvesting and sawing. Hence, any substitution of wood for other materials
  could reduce energy requirements and associated GHG emissions (Kirschbaum, 2000).
  Moreover, the production of metals and plastics generates higher volumes of
  air, water, and solid waste pollutants than wood products such as lumber-particularly
  so with toxic chemicals (USEPA, 1997). </p>
