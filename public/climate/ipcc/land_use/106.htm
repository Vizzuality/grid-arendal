<h4>2.5.2.2. Consistency with Goals and Objectives of Other Multilateral Environmental
  Agreements</h4>
<p>LULUCF policies and measures undertaken to reduce GHG emissions have significant
  potential to have positive or negative impacts on environmental and sustainable
  development objectives that are a central focus of other multilateral environmental
  agreements (MEAs). Key categories of potential impact and corresponding principal
  MEAs include biological diversity (UN Convention on Biological Diversity, CBD),
  desertification (UN Convention to Combat Desertification, CCD), and wetlands
  (Ramsar Convention on Wetlands). In addition, a broad range of issues relating
  to conservation, management, and sustainable development of forests were the
  focus of recently completed policy dialogues of the Intergovernmental Forum
  on Forests (IFF); IFF conclusions and associated proposals for actions will
  be taken up by the UNCSD (IISD, 2000). <br>
  The Parties may need to determine whether and how to ensure that LULUCF definitions,
  activities, and projects under the Protocol are consistent with the goals and
  objectives of relevant MEAs. The foundation for such a decision has been laid
  by the recent SBSTA request that the UNFCCC Secretariat liase with the Secretariats
  of the CBD and the CCD; with the IFF; and with other international bodies of
  the United Nations, such as FAO. Relevant ecosystem protection components of
  the UNFCCC objectives are identified by Article 4, paragraphs 1(d), 1(e), and
  8 and by Article 2.3 of the Kyoto Protocol. </p>
<p>There currently is no recognized set of indicators that could be used to assess
  the consistency of prospective LULUCF climate mitigation measures with the goals
  and objectives of other multilateral environmental agreements and processes.
  Despite this limitation, the Parties may need to decide whether and how to take
  steps to ensure that LULUCF definitions, activities, and projects are operationalized
  in a manner that is consistent with and synergistically supportive of them.
</p>
<p>Brown (1998) proposes that there should be opportunities for LULUCF measures
  to support the objectives of multiple MEAs-for example, by identifying opportunities
  to slow deforestation in areas that are high in biodiversity and contain large
  carbon stores, by rehabilitating degraded rangelands, and by planting windbreaks
  to sequester carbon and reverse desertification. Indeed, many potential LULUCF
  measures could support carbon mitigation and help protect biodiversity, slow
  desertification, or support other environmental objectives (<a href="096.htm">Sections
  2.5.1</a> and <a href="283.htm">5.5</a>). For potential LULUCF projects, the
  Parties may wish to consider whether the Global Environment Facility (GEF) is
  positioned to help non-Annex I countries develop and support projects that meet
  the objectives of multiple MEAs (GEF, 2000). </p>
<p>Some authors have pointed out that some potential LULUCF definitions, activities,
  and projects-such as those that support conversion of natural forests to plantations-might
  be considered inconsistent with the objectives of one or more MEAs (e.g., UNU,
  GEIC, and UNU/IAS, 1998). Similar arguments could be advanced for measures that
  expand plantations on native woodlands or grasslands or drain wetlands. </p>
<p>If the Parties wish to eliminate or otherwise restrict these activities from
  emissions reduction crediting, one option would be to consider the addition
  of limiting clauses on credits, such as that proposed in <a href="112.htm">Chapter
  3</a> to limit reforestation credits. Translating non-carbon environmental and
  socioeconomic concerns into quantitative limits on carbon credits may prove
  difficult, however. Alternatively, policymakers could develop a screening process
  to determine whether certain activities will receive carbon credit at all. Implementation
  of such a screening process for activities at the national level might present
  several challenges and complexities because of their broad geographic scope.
</p>
<p>Several types of LULUCF climate mitigation projects also have the potential
  for negative impacts on native ecosystems, including forests, woodlands, grasslands,
  and wetlands (see <a href="283.htm">Section 5.5</a>). Brown et al. (1998) and
  Hardner et al. (2000) propose eliminating such projects through the application
  of environmental screens prior to project approval. Hardner et al. (2000) propose
  a filter for project approval that excludes from crediting any LULUCF project
  activities that convert native ecosystems to other land uses. The risk of negative
  environmental (and social) impacts of LULUCF projects might also be reduced
  through the application of sound environmental and social impact assessment
  methodologies (<a href="110.htm">Section 2.5.2.5</a>). </p>
<p>In the specific case of reforestation projects in non-Annex I countries, some
  observers have expressed concern that crediting of such projects could promote
  expansion of plantations that replace natural forests whose associated emissions
  would not be constrained by a national commitment (German Advisory Council on
  Global Change, 1998). Currently, the expansion of industrial plantations is
  a significant driver of natural forest loss in some regions (Potter and Lee,
  1998). The Parties might choose to constrain such projects through the application
  of the Deforestation-Reforestation Rule proposed in <a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a> to projects in
  non-Annex I countries. Such projects could be further constrained through sound
  environmental and social screens prior to project approval (Brown <i>et al.</i>,
  1998). </p>
