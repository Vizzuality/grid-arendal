<h2>3.1. Introduction </h2>
<p>Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol specifies that "The net changes in greenhouse
  gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from direct human-induced
  land-use change and forestry activities, limited to afforestation, reforestation
  and deforestation since 1990, measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks
  in each commitment period, shall be used to meet the commitments under this
  Article of each Party included in Annex B. The greenhouse gas emissions by sources
  and removals by sinks associated with those activities shall be reported in
  a transparent and verifiable manner and reviewed in accordance with Articles
  7 and 8." </p>
<p>Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol describes land-use change and forestry activities
  that require GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks to be accounted
  for by Annex I Parties in the first commitment period (see <a href="#figure3-1">Figure
  3-1</a>). These activities are restricted to afforestation, reforestation, and
  deforestation. The term "ARD land" is used in this report, for simplicity, to
  define areas on which ARD activities have occurred since 1990 and for which
  carbon stock changes are calculated. </p>

	  <i><b>Figure 3-1:</b> Sentence structure of Article 3.3,
	  with parts that concern Article 3.3 in bold. The Article begins with
	  LUCF activities (step 1), which must be directly induced by
	  humans (step 2). <a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a> discusses whether and
	  how to meaningfully distinguish direct human-induced activities
	  from all activities in the LUCF sector. In step 3, Article 3.3 says
	  that direct human-induced LUCF activities are limited to ARD.
	  This language is seemingly straightforward except that ARD activities
	  must be defined, which is key to implementing Article 3.3. Step 4 requires
	  that only ARD activities since 1990 can be counted, and step
	  5 demands that these activities be measured as verifiable changes
	  in carbon stocks in each commitment period.</i>

<p>This chapter focuses on delineating issues related to the implementation of
  Article 3.3, options for implementation, and their implications. The United
  Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and post-Kyoto clarifications
  are the starting point for this work. The fourth Conference of the Parties (COP)
  in November 1998 indicated that the adjustment to a Party's assigned amount
  of GHG emissions shall be equal to verifiable changes in carbon stocks during
  the period 2008 to 2012 resulting from DHI activities of ARD since 1 January
  1990 (FCCC, 1998a; FCCC/CP/1998/L.5). The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and
  Technological Advice (SBSTA) noted at its 11th session the IPCC request to Parties
  to submit national data relevant to Article 3.3, preferably by the end of 1999.
  Some countries provided such data for use in this report. </p>
<p>The wording of Article 3.3 raises several questions and potential interpretations.
  How should "direct human-induced" be interpreted? Which definitions should be
  used for afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation activities? Which carbon
  pools should be considered? What carbon accounting rules should be employed?
</p>
<p>We reviewed potential definitions of ARD and focused our analysis on considering
  the major differences among the potential approaches to implementing Article
  3.3. We then developed a set of seven definitional scenarios (combinations of
  definitions of forest, afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation) that
  captured the breadth of the possible definitions. We then explored the implications
  of each scenario on GHG accounting; data needs; compatibility with available
  data; comparability of actual and reported stock changes at stand, landscape,
  and country levels; regional, country, and global potentials for ARD activities;
  and environmental and socioeconomic impacts. We have tried to support the decisionmaking
  process by highlighting the issues, options, and implications that are raised
  by different interpretations of Articles 3.3 and 3.7. This chapter builds on
  the general concepts and issues introduced in <a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a>
  (such as definitions for forest, afforestation, reforestation, deforestation,
  DHI activity, carbon pools, measurement methods, carbon accounting and reporting,
  associated impacts on environment, and associated socioeconomic impacts). There
  are interactions between Article 3.3 and other articles of the Kyoto Protocol;
  this chapter elaborates on some of these interactions-such as the possible counting
  of the same carbon under Articles 3.3 and 3.4 or interactions of Article 3.3
  with Article 6. </p>
