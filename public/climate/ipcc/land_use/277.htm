<h5>5.4.2.1.4. Comparison of methods</h5>
<p><a href="276.htm#table5-9">Table 5-9</a> shows a comparison of the GHG benefits
  attributed to the sequestration project illustrated in <a href="274.htm#figure5-3">Figure
  5-3</a>. The example assumes the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The project is run for three rotations of 18 years each.</li>
  <li>At the end of each rotation, the carbon stock in the forest reaches 140
    t C ha<sup>-1</sup>.</li>
  <li>Harvesting reduces carbon stock to zero, and the baseline is zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculations were conducted assuming a minimum required project duration of
  55 years [based on the <i>Te</i> of 55 years (Moura-Costa and Wilson, 2000)]
  and 100 years [based on the equivalence time of 100 years; see <a href="038.htm">Chapter
  2</a> (Fearnside <i>et al.</i>, 2000)]. It is clear from this example that,
  depending on the accounting method used, different amounts of carbon benefits
  accrue to the project, as is shown by the following results: </p>
<ul>
  <li>According to the stock change method, this project would receive 140 t C
    ha<sup>-1</sup> during the sequestration phase of each rotation and would need to return
    an equivalent amount after each harvest.</li>
  <li>The average storage calculated for the duration of this project is 84 t
    C ha<sup>-1</sup> (using the traditional average storage method, without a fixed minimum
    project duration), which is reached before the end of the first rotation and
    remains the same irrespective of the duration of the project. If a specified
    time frame is adopted for the calculation of the average storage (i.e., with
    a predetermined denominator in the average storage equation), the GHG benefits
    of a project would increase proportionally to the time frame under which the
    project is conducted.</li>
  <li>If a minimum project duration of 55 years were required, the equivalence-adjusted
    average storage of this project (which is conducted for 54 years) would be
    83 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>, whereas if the minimum time frame required were 100 years, the
    equivalence-adjusted average storage would be 45 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, if
    this project were conducted for only one rotation, the project's benefits
    would be lower (see values in parentheses in <a href="276.htm#table5-9">Table
    5-9</a>).</li>
  <li> Another accounting option (the stock change crediting with ton-year liability
    adjustment method) is to use the stock change method to calculate the benefits
    of the projects during the sequestration phase and to use ton-years to calculate
    the "loss" of benefits when emission takes place. Using this approach, the
    calculated GHG benefits of the project at the end of the first rotation would
    be 140 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> (the same as in the stock change method); when emissions take
    place after harvesting, however, the calculated GHG benefits "lost" are either
    112 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> (if a ton-year equivalence factor <i>E<span class="subscript"><span class="subscript">f</span></span></i>
    = 0.0182 is chosen, based on <i>Te</i> = 55) or 136 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> (if a ton-year
    equivalence factor <i>E<span class="subscript">f</span></i> = 0.010 is chosen,
    based on <i>Te</i> = 100). The longer the project duration, the smaller the
    amount of GHG benefits "lost" after harvesting. </li>
  <li> If the GHG benefits of the project are calculated using the equivalence-factor
    yearly crediting method (ton-year accounting), the GHG benefit attributed
    to the project would increase gradually as the project is conducted for a
    longer time frame. Because this method assumes that the ton-year equivalence
    factor reflects the GHG benefit to the atmosphere derived from temporary storage,
    no loss of benefits is assumed when emissions take place. </li>
</ul>
