<h3>5.3.3. Leakage </h3>
<p><i>Leakage</i> is defined as the unanticipated decrease or increase in GHG
  benefits outside of the project's accounting boundary (the boundary defined
  for the purposes of estimating the project's net GHG impact) as a result of
  project activities. For example, conserving forests that otherwise would have
  been deforested for agricultural land may displace farmers to an area outside
  of the project's boundaries. There, the displaced farmers may engage in deforestation-and
  the resulting carbon emissions are referred to as leakage. </p>
<p>Projects may also yield greater GHG benefits than anticipated-positive leakage
  or "spillover." For example, if a project introduced a new land management approach
  or technology-such as increased use of agroforestry or cover crops or increased
  saw mill efficiency-and this technology was more widely adopted outside the
  project's boundaries, the net GHG benefits would be larger than initially estimated.
</p>
<h4><a name="s5-3-3-1"></a>5.3.3.1. Assessing Leakage </h4>
<p>Leakage has been divided into various effects. This section discusses leakage
  effects that are most relevant to forest and land-use projects. </p>
<p>Market effects occur when project activities change the supply/demand equilibrium,
  such as if demand is unmet because a project reduces supply or because it unexpectedly
  increases demand. For example, large-scale plantation projects may depress the
  local price of wood products, causing nearby plantations to be replaced with
  pasture or other low-biomass land uses (Fearnside, 1995). <u>Activity-shifting</u>
  occurs when the activity that causes carbon loss in the project area is displaced
  outside the project boundary. For example, prevention of deforestation in the
  project area may displace the GHG-emitting activity. </p>
<p>Although project experience to date is limited, case studies have indicated
  that landscape dynamics may signal if the project has no or low potential for
  leakage or a moderate to high risk for leakage. </p>
<p><i>No/Low Leakage Potential:</i> Experience to date indicates that projects
  implemented on land that has few or no competing uses are unlikely to impact
  areas outside of project activities, and leakage potential is minimal. For example,
  the Krkonose project in the Czech Republic (see <a href="253.htm#table5-2">Table
  5-2</a> and <a href="251.htm#box5-1">Box 5-1</a>) is situated in a protected
  area with virtually no danger of encroachment or displacement because the park
  had protected status for many years (Brown <i>et al.</i>, 1997). </p>
<p><i>Moderate/High Leakage Potential:</i> Where land has competing uses or in
  dynamic settings where factors such as population growth, logging or agricultural
  production for export, subsistence agriculture, fuelwood needs, and concerns
  about deforestation interact, a project's impact may extend beyond the area
  of direct project activities (Brown, 1998). If net GHG benefits estimated and
  monitored fail to account for emissions that arise because of the project outside
  the area of direct activities, leakage is an issue. For example, a project that
  stops the conversion of forest to agricultural land or ends timber harvest by
  effectively "putting a fence around the forest" will face leakage problems because
  if an economic activity in the forest is stopped with no alternative taking
  its place, people will shift the activity to a surrounding area. </p>
<p>Changes in national or international policies also can lead to leakage. For
  example, when a government changes its policy to lower the country's overall
  emissions, the emissions may be displaced to other countries (see Section 2.1.1).</p>
