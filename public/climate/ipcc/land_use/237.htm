<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.14. Forest Fire Management </h3>
<p>This activity includes efforts to regulate the recycling of forest biomass
  from fires, maintain healthy forest ecosystems, and reduce total emissions of
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and other GHGs. </p>
<p>Fire management practices vary greatly between forest ecosystems, depending
  on the historical or natural fire regime for the ecosystem, the current condition
  of the forest, and the management objectives of the landowner. In many cases,
  mechanical vegetative manipulation or planned prescribed fires can be utilized
  to maintain conditions approximating historical ranges. In some cases, where
  past fire suppression has resulted in fuel buildups, the ecological risk of
  burning-either in a prescribed or wildfire-is now so great that mechanical means
  of fuel removal may be a precursor to any management scheme designed to restore
  fire's role in the ecosystem (Neuenschwander and Sampson, 2000). Where such
  fuel removal is carried out, wildfire ignitions are less likely to result-and
  when they happen, they will often burn at lowered severities, with reduced fuel
  consumption, heat production, and GHG emissions. Because fire management is
  an integral part of forest management, it must be viewed in connection with
  other management practices, including harvest and wood utilization, to evaluate
  its full carbon flux effect. </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  Destruction of forest biomass by burning releases large quantities of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and
  is estimated to create 10 percent of annual global methane emissions as well
  as 10-20 percent of global N<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions. Thus, fire can have a significant
  effect on atmospheric chemistry (IPCC, 1992). The process is well known in terms
  of general effects, but it has many uncertain parameters in relation to specific
  fire events because fire effects are related to fuel amounts, arrangements,
  and conditions as well as weather conditions at the time of combustion-all of
  which can be highly variable or unpredictable (Goldammer, 1990; Dixon and Krankina,
  1993; Price <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Neuenschwander <i>et al.</i>, 2000). </p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, Transparency, and Permanence </b><br>
  These factors are very difficult to achieve in relation to wildfires, which
  are such highly stochastic events that any estimate of the effect of management
  on actual changes in wildfire dynamics is likely to be speculative. Post-event
  monitoring, however, has begun to provide estimates that can be used to build
  predictive models (Neuenschwander and Sampson, 2000). Quantification of the
  carbon stock impact can be estimated by comparing data on historical forest
  fire frequency and fuel consumption with experience in a reporting period. Forecasting
  can use techniques that take local weather history and use probability analysis
  to predict the occurrence of future weather combinations that will support large
  wildfires (Neuenschwander and Sampson, 2000). Such forecasting relies on the
  assumption that future climate will not alter fire weather occurrence to a great
  extent and that it will not contribute to large areas of forest die-off that
  could create hazardous fuel levels; neither assumption may be fully warranted
  at this time (Apps <i>et al.</i>, 1999a). </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  The associated environmental impacts of this activity are difficult to generalize
  because some ecosystems need fire to be sustainable. Restoring near-historical
  fire regimes may be an important component of sustainable forestry but may also
  require access (road construction) and other practices that may create other
  environmental effects that are known to be deleterious. Wildland fire in areas
  near human habitation creates major hazards to life and property, so intentional
  restoration of historical fire regimes is a risky management activity that is
  associated with serious social and economic considerations that often restrict
  its application. Jobs and income may increase if the timber saved from fire
  is used in sustainable forest harvesting. The costs of fire prevention in remote
  forest regions and the risks of accidental fire escape during prescribed fires
  are probably the most important reasons that this activity is not more widespread.
</p>
<p><b>Relationship to IPCC Guidelines </b><br>
  Emissions of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and other GHGs from forest fires following deforestation and
  conversion to other land uses are included in the Guidelines. CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions
  from fires within managed forests are not included, but non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions are.
