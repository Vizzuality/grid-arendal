<h2>5.2. Magnitude and Experience of Project-Based Activities</h2>
<p>This section reviews the experience of LULUCF projects that generate GHG and
  other benefits and are being implemented on the ground at least partially. It
  summarizes estimated GHG benefits for 27 such projects and several portfolios
  of projects, reviews estimated project costs, and assesses the limited estimates
  of the potential magnitude of project activities under Article 6 and possibly
  Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol. </p>
<p>Some of the key questions addressed in this section follow: </p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the experience of the voluntary, non-credit, AIJ Pilot Phase established
    by the UNFCCC in terms of the number, type, and technical issues surrounding
    LULUCF projects?</li>
  <li>What are the cost estimates of such projects, and how do they vary by project
    type and location?</li>
  <li>What is the likely supply and cost of projects that might help Annex I countries
    meet their emissions reduction commitments under Articles 6 and 12?</li>
  <li>Are such projects likely to be implemented at significant scales by 2012?</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="s5-2-1"></a>5.2.1. Quantifying Project Activities: Issues and Methods</h3>
<p>By far, most LULUCF projects being implemented within countries or funded internationally
  are designed to promote economic and social development, without regard for
  their potential GHG benefits. Such projects provide timber or fuelwood supply,
  community woodlots, agroforestry crops, soil conservation, biodiversity or watershed
  protection, and socioeconomic development. The GHG implications of these projects
  generally have not been estimated or reported.</p>
<p>Six representative case studies of LULUCF projects that are being implemented
  illustrate the diversity of project types, locations, and estimated GHG benefits
  and costs (<a href="#box5-1">Box 5-1</a>). These cases provide an introduction
  to the kinds of activities, the projected socioeconomic benefits, and the environmental
  impacts associated with LULUCF projects described throughout this chapter. These
  cases are representative of two major categories of LULUCF projects (see <a href="249.htm">Section
  5.1</a>): carbon sequestration through increases in carbon stocks, and emissions
  avoidance through conservation of existing carbon stocks. </p>
