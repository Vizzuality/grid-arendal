<h3>2.3.4. Baselines </h3>
<p>Once applicable activities and an accounting framework have been selected,
  it is necessary to determine which carbon related to these activities will be
  counted in determining Parties' compliance with their Kyoto commitments. This
  section introduces the concept of baselines-which can be used, if desired, to
  adjust carbon stock accounts to discriminate between the effects of LULUCF activities
  and other factors as well as to factor out the effects of business-as-usual
  and activity undertaken prior to 1990. </p>
<p>Baselines are the reference scenario against which a change in GHG emissions
  or removals is measured. There are many options for baselines, including the
  stock change that would have resulted from "business-as-usual" activities; the
  stock change that would have resulted from the continuation of current or 1990
  activity levels; the stock change that would result in the absence of active
  management; performance benchmarks or standard management practices; or the
  rate of change of stocks in 1990. </p>
<p>Baselines could be set at a national, regional, or project level. National
  baselines presumably would be developed from analysis of regional trends and
  practices and could be based on a combination of measurements on control plots
  and models. Regional baselines could also be used as a constraint on the baselines
  for projects within the region. If national baselines were developed using a
  standardized methodology and agreed upon at the international level (e.g., by
  the COP), the design of incentives for individual landowners to enhance carbon
  sequestration could be purely a matter of domestic policy in each country. </p>
<p>Baselines need not necessarily be derived solely from observed trends and practices
  in a given country or region. Internationally agreed performance benchmarks
  have also been suggested as a means for establishing objective baselines (Lazarus
  et al., 1999). For example, certain practices could be considered "standard
  management practice," and baselines might be set to reflect the level of carbon
  sequestration that would occur if these practices were universally applied.
  Credit would then be available only to the extent that there was an improvement
  compared to the results of applying these standard practices. The applicability
  of this approach to the LULUCF sector is unclear, however, because there is
  no set of internationally agreed "standard management practices," and such practices
  may be difficult to define for the wide variety of situations that will be encountered
  in the field. </p>
<p>Baselines can be reflected in the adjustment terms of the accounting equations
  presented in <a href="062.htm#table2-3">Table 2-3</a>, if the Parties so decide.
  In the land-based rule, the baseline stock change may be subtracted from the
  gross change in carbon stocks during the commitment period on land included
  in the system. Similarly, in the activity-based rule a baseline area subject
  to the activity under business-as-usual might be subtracted from the total area
  where the activity takes place during a commitment period. In addition, the
  impact of the activity per unit area may implicitly be calculated relative to
  a baseline representing the absence of that activity. </p>
<p>Key policy questions that could be addressed through the use of appropriate
  baselines are as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Will the accounting system include adjustments for the effect of non-human-induced
    factors? </li>
  <li> Will the accounting system include adjustments for the effect of business-as-usual
    activity? </li>
  <li> Will the accounting system be adjusted for the effect of activities undertaken
    prior to 1990? </li>
</ul>
<p>These questions may be addressed differently for ARD activities, Article 3.4
  activities, and projects. Decision 9/CP.4 requires accounting for ARD activities
  as changes in stock during the commitment period without making reference to
  a baseline stock change (suggesting that the baseline adjustment term may be
  zero for Article 3.3 accounting). Articles 6 and 12, on the other hand, require
  that credit be based on benefits that are "additional" to what otherwise would
  have occurred, implying the use of a "business-as-usual" baseline. Project developers
  therefore have had to develop methods to define "business-as-usual" baselines.
  A more detailed discussion of these methods appears in <a href="246.htm">Chapter
  5</a>. Article 3.4 requires the COP to "decide upon modalities, rules, and guidelines
  as to how" additional activities will be included. Thus, the Parties must decide
  whether to require a baseline and, if one is required, how it should be calculated.
  If the Parties determine that such a baseline requirement is not relevant to
  Article 3.4, the baseline adjustment term can be set to zero in the accounting
  equation. </p>
<p>The following three sections provide additional information to guide decisions
  regarding each of the policy questions relevant to the use of baselines. Distinctions
  are made between ARD activities, Article 3.4 activities, and projects where
  appropriate. More details related to each of these types of activity appear
  in subsequent chapters. </p>
