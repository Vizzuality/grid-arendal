<h2>6.4. Adequacy of the IPCC Guidelines for Reporting Projects under the Kyoto
  Protocol</h2>
<p>This section assesses the adequacy of the Guidelines for estimating changes
  in stocks associated with LULUCF projects. It briefly summarizes the kinds of
  changes to the Guidelines that may be needed, recognizing that there are aspects
  of reporting that are of a policy nature (e.g., certification) that are not
  addressed here. </p>
<p>Under the Kyoto Protocol, reporting of projects will be required. The Guidelines
  do not address projects, although many of the accounting methods can be applied
  to estimate emissions and removals of GHGs, changes in carbon stock, and associated
  activities. At this time, it is unclear which LULUCF activities will be included
  under Articles 6 and 12 and potentially under Articles 3.3 and 3.4. Clearly,
  however, many of the data and reporting requirements are similar to those of
  Articles 3.3 and 3.4 (see <a href="305.htm">Section 6.3</a>) if comprehensive
  accounting were applied. In addition, the following issues arise (see <a href="300.htm">Section
  6.2</a> and <a href="246.htm">Chapter 5</a>; Vine <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>The degree of improvements to the Guidelines depends on their intended use.
  Within each of the options below, Parties could choose their own methods, or
  internationally agreed methods could be stipulated. There are three main options
  of increasing complexity: </p>
<p><i>Option 1.</i> If the Guidelines are intended to show impacts to a Party's
  assigned amount, a summary of changes in net GHG emissions and removals from
  all projects may be all that is required. The first step would involve the transfer
  of GHG emissions and removals from the project to the national inventory; in
  the second step, the GHGs from projects would be subtracted from the national
  inventory. </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Option 1a</i>-This option would allow Parties to choose a different reporting
    format for projects approved by the Parties. An example would be a modification
    of the URF used in the Activities Implemented Jointly Pilot Project (Annex
    III, FCCC, 1997b; Vine <i>et al.</i>, 1999, <a href="282.htm">Section 5.4.6</a>).
    This option is the simplest to operationalize, but it lacks transparency in
    methods and data.</li>
  <li><i>Option 1b</i>-This option could stipulate the use of internationally
    agreed methods and perhaps involve the use of guidance for the URF.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Option 2.</i> If the Guidelines are intended to enable Parties to generate
  a complete and transparent record of GHG emissions and removals from each project-including
  a breakdown of all activities, baselines, leakage, risks, and so forth (see
  methods in <a href="246.htm">Chapter 5</a>)-considerable changes will be required.
</p>
<p><i>Option 3.</i> Finally, there may be a need to report all changes in net
  GHG emissions and removals, as well as environmental and socioeconomic impacts,
  especially for CDM projects (Article 12). </p>
<p>In option 1, a reporting format for projects could be developed with the Guidelines
  with minimal effort. This option would require a decision to report data at
  an appropriate, aggregated scale. For options 2 and 3, considerable effort may
  be required to qualify for carbon credits. The period involved in developing
  these options would depend on the decisions of the Parties. </p>
