  <li> <a name="1"></a>Canopy (or crown) projected cover is the proportion of ground area covered
    by tree crowns. CPC is estimated by vertically projecting outlines of tree
    crowns onto the horizontal plane that represents the forest stand area. It
    is also called "crown cover," "canopy closure," "cover closure," or similar
    terms such as "polnota." Another term-foliage projected cover (FPC)-is used
    occasionally. FPC is the proportion of a forest stand covered by foliage,
    which is usually a little less than CPC. FPC should not be confused with leaf
    area index (LAI), which is the ratio of the one-sided projection of the area
    of leaves (or needles) to the ground area-essentially, the average number
    of leaves above a point in the forest stand.</li>
    <p></p>
  <li> <a name="2"></a>In calculating the Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) of
    GHGs, it was assumed that CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fertilization
    is not anthropogenic. The calculations use models that take into account the
    absorption of GHGs into the oceans and, in the case of the reference gas,
    CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, its uptake as a consequence of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
    fertilization. Thus, if CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fertilization were
    subtracted from the estimate of total emissions (i.e., on the basis that it
    is anthropogenic and is an uptake), the effect of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
    fertilization would be double-counted. Although this effect could be corrected
    by recalculating all of the GWPs, this recalculation would have other policy
    repercussions. The main effect of such a recalculation would be to significantly
    reduce the GWPs of non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> GHGs.</li>
    <p></p>
  <li> <a name="3"></a>Carbon sequestration must be distinguished from fossil
    fuel substitution, which can also be achieved by some LULUCF options (e.g.,
    charcoal substitution for mineral coal). Fossil fuel substitution through
    forestry is just as permanent as avoided emissions through measures such as
    enhancing energy efficiency.</li>
    <p></p>
  <li> <a name="4"></a>The approximation of the output of the Bern model version
    used (but not published) in the SAR is given by:<br>
    F[CO<span class="subscript">2</span>(<i>t</i>)]
    = 0.175602 + 0.137467 exp(-<i>t</i>/421.093) + 0.185762 exp(-<i>t</i>/70.5965)
    + 0.242302 exp(-<i>t</i>/21.42165) + 0.258868 exp(-<i>t</i>/3.41537)<br> where
    F is the fraction of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> remaining in the atmosphere
    and t is the time after emission in years.</li>
    <p></p>
  <li><a name="5"></a> This Special Report makes no assumption about whether,
    or to what extent, LULUCF project activities will be approved for crediting
    under the CDM.<br>
  </li>
    <p></p>
  <li><a name="6"></a> The categorization of LULUCF activities in this chapter
    differs slightly from the categorization of LULUCF projects in <a href="293.htm">Chapter
    6</a>. The primary distinction across activity categories here is the change
    in land use, whereas the primary distinction across project categories in
    <a href="293.htm">Chapter 6</a> is the change in carbon. </li>
