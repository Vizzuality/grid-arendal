<h4>5.3.3.3. Options for Responding to Leakage </h4>
<p>To date, two approaches have been used /proposed to address leakage; these
  two approaches may be employed independently or simultaneously. One approach
  involves addressing leakage at the project level through either project design
  or re-estimating of net GHG benefits. Some people question whether project-level
  approaches can adequately ensure that leakage will be addressed, however. As
  a response, macro-level approaches to address leakage have been proposed that
  would involve developing regional or national baselines or establishing risk
  coefficients by project type or characteristic. </p>
<p><i>Project-level approaches:</i> Leakage potential may be identified at the
  front end of project design and additional activities incorporated if the project
  appears vulnerable to leakage. If evidence of leakage emerges after project
  implementation has begun, project implementers may undertake additional activities
  to mitigate leakage or to monitor it and subsequently revise net GHG estimates.
</p>
<p><i>Project design elements incorporated in projects:</i> Although experience
  to date is limited, several elements have emerged that may help avoid leakage,
  depending on the socioeconomic and physical context of the project. Project
  design strategies that have been used to avoid leakage include providing socioeconomic
  benefits to local people that create incentives to maintain the project and
  its GHG benefits because of these associated benefits and using replicable or
  transferable technologies that can help avoid leakage because they allow project
  benefits to be duplicated outside project boundaries, so that social benefits
  are not restricted to a limited area. Incorporating these elements can help
  avoid leakage. </p>
<p>Multi-component projects may also help avoid leakage because they can combine
  project activities to fully address demands that drive land-use change (Chomitz,
  2000). For example, the Costa Rican PAP generated carbon offsets by avoiding
  carbon emissions and through carbon sequestration. The PAP is consolidating
  approximately 570,000 ha of primary, secondary, and pasture lands within the
  National Parks and Biological Reserves of Costa Rica (Tattenbach, 1996; Stuart
  and Moura-Costa, 1998). The PAP plans to reduce deforestation of primary forest,
  thereby reducing carbon emissions resulting from deforestation. The PAP also
  plans to allow secondary forest and pasture to regenerate, thereby sequestering
  carbon through tree growth and accumulation of woody biomass. Concurrently,
  Costa Rica has also developed a parallel program, the PFP, which provides financial
  incentives for land owners outside the PAP area to opt for forestry-related
  land uses as opposed to agriculture-thereby generating a series of environmental
  services, such as CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fixation, maintenance of water quality, biodiversity,
  and landscape beauty (Forestry Law N. 7575, April 1996) (Stuart and Moura-Costa,
  1998). The PFP is also expected to offset the effects of decreasing timber harvest
  in the project area, reducing possible leakage effects. </p>
<p>Another example of a multi-component project is the CARE/ Guatemala project,
  which increased fuelwood availability and agricultural productivity by encouraging
  agroforestry. The project also protected some forest areas, allowing degraded
  areas to regenerate. The CARE/Guatemala project began in 1988, and persisted
  through years of political strife and high demand for agricultural land because
  the project combined elements of forest protection with agricultural extension
  that provided social benefits that gave local people a stake in the project's
  success (Brown <i>et al.</i>, 1997). </p>
<p><i>Re-estimation of net GHG benefits:</i> Leakage cannot always be avoided
  at the outset or mitigated with additional activities. In some cases, GHG estimates
  can be recalculated. If project implementers can quantify the shortfall in output
  from the project, they can quantify the amount of leakage (Brown <i>et al.</i>,
  1997). To recalculate the original net GHG benefits, the project evaluator must
  determine approximately how much area must be logged or converted to agriculture
  to compensate for the decrease in output. </p>
<p>For example, the RIL project in Malaysia (see <a href="253.htm#table5-2">Table
  5-2</a>) was originally estimated to avoid 38,700 t of carbon emissions. However,
  the project may have resulted in carbon leakage because on 450 ha of the 1,400
  ha project, timber production was decreased by approximately 49 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> relative
  to conventional logging. Total timber shortfall was 450 ha x 49 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> = 22,050
  m<sup>3</sup> of reduced timber output. To quantify the amount of potential leakage, it
  is possible to estimate the additional area that must be logged to make up for
  the deficit. The leakage potential could be roughly determined by estimating
  the amount of emissions resulting from logging to compensate for the 22,050
  m<sup>3</sup> of reduced output. Assuming that RIL makes up for the shortfall, leakage
  could be estimated as follows: RIL emits 108 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> and yields 103 m<sup>3</sup> of timber
  per ha (Pinard and Putz 1997); therefore, harvesting 214 ha using RIL methods
  would make up for the reduced output. Leakage then equals 23,112 t C emitted
  (214 ha x 108 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>). Thus, the estimated net carbon benefit is 38,700 t
  C (the original amount) - 23,112 t C (the leakage) = 15,558 t C. </p>
<p>These estimates are approximate, and they represent only one harvest cycle.
  They illustrate one means of quantifying leakage. In this example, RIL still
  results in a net carbon gain-which might or might not be the case for all projects.
  In addition, RIL projects are designed to increase output over time because
  there is less damage to young trees. In the long run, RIL sites may produce
  greater output than conventionally logged sites. </p>
<p><i>Macro-level approaches:</i> Alternatives to project-based approaches have
  been proposed, including estimation of empirically based sectoral, national,
  or regional baselines that can potentially capture leakage, and development
  of adjustment coefficients for leakage risk and adjustment of net GHG estimates
  accordingly: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>National and regional baselines:</i> Adopting sectoral or regional baselines
    on LULUCF emissions and sequestration is one alternative to the project-based
    approach. If a project attempted to reduce the rate or area of deforestation,
    the project-level effect would need to be demonstrated in subsequent monitoring
    and baseline estimates improved. By encompassing a large geographic area,
    leakage could be internalized. One proposal involves developing national,
    regional, or sectoral baselines on land-use change and management; this approach
    is based on the concept of tradable development rights. As above, a regional
    baseline deforestation rate would be determined by using land-use trends.
    A certain percentage of the forest would be protected, and the remaining forest
    could be developed (Chomitz, 2000). Allowance or development rights to the
    forest would be distributed; the owners of these development allowances could
    then in turn sell the development rights. In areas where development was allowed,
    the carbon sequestration services of the forest could be sold instead of developing
    the forest (Chomitz, 2000).</li>
  <li><i> Risk premiums and adjustment coeffiecients:</i> To overcome the complexity
    of quantifying leakage, another approach is assigning specific leakage coefficients
    (Trexler and Kosloff, 1998). Project estimates could then be adjusted by this
    coefficient (Gustavsson <i>et al.</i>, 1999). These coefficients could be
    developed at a regional or national level for different project types. The
    effect of risk premiums or adjustment coefficients is that the projects can
    claim only a portion of the estimated GHG benefits. A percentage of the net
    GHG benefit is retained in a buffer to cover the risk of leakage-the goal
    being to protect the atmosphere from added carbon emissions. For example,
    the PAP in Costa Rica has a reserve or buffer of carbon sequestered to insure
    against various risks, including leakage. The PAP assumes that some of the
    subsistence-based farmers who move from the forest may squat on new land,
    resulting in leakage. The PAP estimates a low risk of leakage because only
    22,223 ha of the total of 530,498 ha is currently in private hands. Therefore,
    if 25 percent of all private owners choose to buy or occupy new areas of land
    and deforest them, the carbon offsets arising from over than 1 percent of
    the total project area would be negated. As a response, in its first year
    the PAP will offer only half of the estimated emission reductions for sale,
    with the rest serving as an insurance buffer for this and other estimated
    risks (Chomitz <i>et al.</i>, 1999).</li>
