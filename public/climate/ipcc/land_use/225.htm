<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.2. Irrigation Water Management </h3>
<p>Productivity of cropland and grazing land can be enhanced by supplemental irrigation
  in drought-prone ecosystems and by water table management in seasonally wet
  soils. </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  Irrigated crops are grown on about 255 Mha (FAO, 1999). The potentially irrigable
  land area in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated at 39 Mha (Hillel, 1997), and there
  is additional potential in Asia and South America. Most irrigation is in areas
  with low levels of SOC in the native state. Therefore, there is a large potential
  for carbon sequestration by the use of irrigation (Lal <i>et al.</i>, 1998;
  Conant <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Global expansion of irrigation requires successful
  resolution of socioeconomic and political issues (Scheumann, 1993; Beaumont,
  1996; McCown, 1996). Although drainage of wet soils (organic and mineral soils)
  enhances crop and animal productivity, it reduces biodiversity. Drainage decreases
  methane emissions but leads to loss of SOC stock. Therefore, adopting judicious
  methods of water table management, including sub-irrigation and water recycling,
  is necessary to SOC sequestration. </p>
<p><b>Current Knowledge and Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  Experimental data on soil carbon (SOC and SIC) dynamics in irrigated soils is
  scanty. Application of water to drylands influences biomass productivity, increases
  the amount of residue returned, changes mineralization rates, and alters the
  carbonate balance. Experimental rates of soil carbon sequestration range from
  0.05 to 0.15 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for SOC (Lal <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Conant <i>et al.</i>,
  2000) and 0.05 to 0.10 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for SIC (Wilding, 1999; Nordt <i>et al.</i>,
  2000). Excessive irrigation, lack of proper drainage, and use of poor-quality
  irrigation water accentuate the risks of soil salinization. Use of proper irrigation
  methods and improved cropping systems is therefore essential to reap the benefits
  of irrigation in enhancing productivity and soil carbon sequestration. </p>
<p><b>Methods</b><br>
  At the plot or field level, soils can be sampled and SOC changes determined
  by laboratory analysis. Rates can be developed from selected fields by the use
  of models along with soil maps and other digital databases to expand localized
  measurements to the watershed or ecoregions and to national scales. Remote sensing
  can be used to determine the areas under improved water management. (Determining
  the area under irrigation is very easy with remote sensing, but assessing areas
  to which improved water table management is being applied is more difficult.)
</p>
<p><b>Time Scale </b><br>
  The soils in arid and semi-arid regions are inherently low in SOC and would
  take 50-100 years to reach a steady state. With proper water management, dissolved
  organic carbon (DOC) would continue to move downward in the soil profile, with
  the potential to bind with soil minerals and form stable organo-mineral complexes.
</p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, and Transparency </b><br>
  Monitoring entails using direct sampling and modeling to quantify changes in
  SOC levels and using remote sensing to determine the area being irrigated. In
  areas with low initial SOC levels, changes may be relatively easy to measure
  over short time periods (e.g., 5-year intervals). This practice is very transparent
  and can be used, monitored, and verified in all areas. </p>
<p><b>Removals</b><br>
  If the irrigation were stopped, the sequestration would stop. If the soil is
  tilled, the stored carbon would be lost. </p>
<p><b>Permanence</b><br>
  The bulk of sequestered carbon will be in the soil, with residence times of
  years to centuries. </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  Irrigation enhances biomass productivity in water-limited agricultural systems.
  In addition to increasing the risk of salinization, irrigation also requires
  energy input for pumping and distributing water. </p>
<p><b>Relationship to IPCC Guidelines </b><br>
  Irrigation and water management practices are not explicitly included in the
  calculations for soil carbon. The effects of irrigation on residue carbon inputs
  can be expressed through the choice of "Input Factors." The influence of irrigation
  on carbon turnover rates and inorganic (carbonate) carbon changes, however,
  are not dealt with and would require appropriate revisions to the IPCC Guidelines.
