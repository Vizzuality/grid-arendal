<h2>3.2. Definitional Scenarios and Their General Implications </h2>
<p>There are hundreds of variations of definitions for each term (e.g., forest,
  afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation-see Lund, 1999, 2000) that are
  relevant to implementing Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol (see <a href="045.htm#s2-2-2">Sections
  2.2.2</a> and <a href="047.htm">2.2.3</a> for discussions of the options). Examining
  the implications of each variant would not be fruitful; the result would be
  greater confusion, rather than the clarity we are seeking. Instead, the key
  to exploring the implications of these definitions is to classify them into
  broad groupings. Each of the groupings can then be explored in terms of the
  strengths and weaknesses of the broad approach. <a href="046.htm">Section 2.2.2.1</a>
  discusses the broad categories of forest definitions (administrative, land use,
  and land cover), which are key to understanding the implications of different
  definitions of afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation. <a href="045.htm#s2-2-2">Sections
  2.2.2</a> and <a href="047.htm">2.2.3</a> detail the range of plausible options
  for defining afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation. To facilitate
  discussion of the implications of different options for defining afforestation,
  reforestation, and deforestation, we have identified seven definitional scenarios
  that cover the range of definitions of forest, afforestation, reforestation,
  and deforestation. These scenarios are designed to provide a wide range of plausible
  combinations of definitions through which the implications of different options
  can be explored. We have explicitly avoided customizing definitions on the basis
  of biome type, specific management regimes, or socioeconomic conditions; instead,
  we explore definitions that are sufficiently robust to address diverse conditions
  over long periods of time. </p>
<p>This chapter explores how changes in land use and land cover influence carbon
  emissions and sequestration. The land-use status of an area of land characterizes
  how it is utilized to meet a human need; it represents a socioeconomic perspective
  on the status of the land. In contrast, land-cover characterizations of an area
  of land focus on what vegetation is, or is not, present. Land use-based definitions
  of afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation are difficult to measure
  and verify because the intended use of the land may not be the same as the actual
  use. For example, if a nation designates a piece of land as a location where
  forest management should take place, is that designation sufficient to define
  the land as forest, even in the absence of trees? Land use can be determined
  administratively and culturally, further complicating the employment of land
  use-based definitions. Land cover, on the other hand, is easier to measure and
  verify, but transitions from one cover class to another can easily be misinterpreted.
  For example, following a clear felling, the lack of a forest canopy cover could
  be assumed to represent deforestation, when in fact tree regeneration is taking
  place. The use of existing land cover as the sole basis for defining afforestation,
  reforestation, and deforestation would cause harvest/regeneration cycles to
  be accounted under Article 3.3. This situation can be avoided by instead using
  the potential land cover of the existing vegetation at maturity. </p>
<p>A variant of the land-cover approach to define a forest is based on the carbon
  status of the land. Such an approach acknowledges that a carbon-based definition
  may avoid the geographical complexities and varying intents of the existing
  array of definitions of a forest. Given the variability in existing inventory
  data, any new approach to define a forest will need to consider regional/national
  differences in available data. Carbon-based definitions can rely on a variety
  of data (e.g., timber volume, basal area, stocking density and age) from which
  afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation events can be determined. </p>
<p>As <a href="068.htm">Section 2.3.4.1</a> notes, it is not clear whether the
  term "direct human-induced" refers only to the ARD activities or also to the
  stock changes resulting from ARD activities; this issue is further discussed
  in <a href="127.htm">Section 3.3.2.1</a>. Here we discuss the difficulty in
  defining direct human-induced ARD activities. Implementation of ARD would be
  easier and unnecessary ambiguities could be avoided if any change in vegetation
  resulting from a decision by a land manager to change land-use practices were
  regarded as DHI. Another way of dealing with "direct human-induced" is to assume
  that ARD activities on certain lands (e.g., managed lands) are always DHI and
  that activities on the remaining lands (unmanaged lands) are not DHI. This rule
  has at least two logical exceptions. First, if afforestation or reforestation
  takes place on unmanaged lands, the burden of proof for "direct human-induced"
  is with the party who wants to claim credits. The land would subsequently become
  managed land. Second, if forest regeneration does not follow a natural disturbance
  on managed lands (e.g., hurricanes or landslides), one must decide whether this
  deforestation qualifies as DHI. With a subsequent agricultural or residential
  use, for example, the deforestation could be regarded as DHI. </p>
