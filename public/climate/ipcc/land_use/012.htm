<h2><a name="sa-2"></a>Appendix II. - Relevant Portions of Kyoto Protocol Articles
  Discussed in this Special Report </h2>
<p>[Concepts in <b>bold</b> are discussed in the SPM] </p>
<p>Article 2.1: Each Party included in Annex I in achieving its quantified emission
  limitation and reduction commitments under Article 3, in order to promote <b>sustainable
  development</b>, shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Implement and/or further elaborate policies and measures in accordance with
    its national circumstances, such as: <br>
    <br>
    <ol type="i" start="2">
      <li> Protection and enhancement of sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases
	not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, taking into account its commitments
	under relevant international environmental agreements; promotion of sustainable
	forest management practices, afforestation and reforestation. </li>
      <li>Promotion of sustainable forms of agriculture in light of climate change
	considerations. <br>
	<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Cooperate with other such Parties to enhance the individual and combined
    effectiveness of their policies and measures adopted under this Article, pursuant
    to Article 4, paragraph 2(e)(i), of the Convention. To this end, these Parties
    shall take steps to share their experience and exchange information on such
    policies and measures, including developing ways of improving their comparability,
    transparency, and effectiveness. The Conference of the Parties serving as
    the meeting of the parties to this Protocol shall, at its first session or
    as soon as practicable thereafter, consider ways to facilitate such cooperation,
    taking into account all relevant information. </li>
</ol>
<p>Article 3.1: "The Parties included in Annex I shall, individually or jointly,
  ensure that their aggregate anthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emissions
  of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A do not exceed their assigned amounts,
  calculated pursuant to their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments
  inscribed in Annex B and in accordance with the provisions of this Article,
  with a view to reducing their overall emissions of such gases by at least 5%
  below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008-2012." </p>
<p>Article 3.3: The net changes in greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals
  by sinks resulting from <b>direct human-induced land use change and forestry
  activities</b>, limited to <b>afforestation, reforestation and deforestation
  since 1990</b>, measured as <b>verifiable</b> changes in <b>carbon stocks</b>
  in each commitment period, shall be used to meet the commitments under this
  Article of each Party included in Annex I. The greenhouse gas emissions by sources
  and removals by sinks associated with those activities shall be reported in
  a <b>transparent</b> and <b>verifiable</b> manner and reviewed in accordance
  with Articles 7 and 8. </p>
<p>Article 3.4: Prior to the first session of the COP serving as the meeting of
  the Parties to this Protocol, each Party included in Annex I shall provide,
  for consideration by the SBSTA, <b>data to establish its level of carbon stocks
  in 1990</b> and to enable an estimate to be made of its <b>changes in carbon
  stocks in subsequent years</b>. The COP serving as the meeting of the Parties
  to this Protocol shall, at its first session or as soon as practicable thereafter,
  decide upon <b>modalities, rules and guidelines</b> as to <b>how, and which,
  additional human-induced activities</b> related to <b>changes in greenhouse
  gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the agricultural soils and
  the land-use change and forestry</b> categories shall be added to, or subtracted
  from, the assigned amounts for Parties included in Annex I, taking into account
  <b>uncertainties, transparency in reporting, verifiability</b>, the methodological
  work of the IPCC, the advice provided by the SBSTA in accordance with Article
  5 and the decisions of the COP. Such a decision shall apply in the second and
  subsequent commitment periods. A Party may choose to apply such a decision on
  these additional human-induced activities for its first commitment period, provided
  that these activities have taken place <b>since 1990</b>. </p>
<p>Article 3.7: In the first quantified emission limitation and reduction commitment
  period, from 2008 to 2012, the assigned amount for each Party included in Annex
  I shall be equal to the percentage inscribed for it in Annex B of its aggregate
  anthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of the greenhouse gases listed
  in Annex A in 1990, or the base year or period determined in accordance with
  paragraph 5 above, multiplied by five. Those Parties included in Annex I for
  whom land use change and forestry constituted a net source of greenhouse gas
  emissions in 1990, shall include in their 1990 emissions base year or period,
  the aggregate anthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emissions minus removals
  in 1990 from land use change for the purposes of calculating their assigned
  amount. </p>
<p>Article 5.2:Methodologies for estimating anthropogenic emissions by sources
  and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal
  Protocol shall be those accepted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
  and agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties at its third session. Where
  such methodologies are not used, appropriate adjustments shall be applied according
  to methodologies agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties serving as the
  meeting of the Parties to this protocol at its first session. Based on the work
  of, inter alia, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and advice provided
  by the Subsidiary Body for Science and Technological Advice, the Conference
  of the Parties serving as the meeting of the parties to this Protocol shall
  regularly review and, as appropriate, revise such methodologies and adjustments,
  taking into account any relevant decisions by the Conference of the Parties.
  Any revision to methodologies or adjustments shall be used only for the purposes
  of ascertaining compliance with commitments under Article 3 in respect of any
  commitment period adopted subsequent to that revision. </p>
<p>Article 6.1: For the purpose of meeting its commitments under Article 3, any
  Party included in Annex I may transfer to, or acquire from, any other such Party
  emission reduction units resulting from projects aimed at reducing anthropogenic
  emissions by sources or enhancing anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse
  gases in any sector of the economy, provided that: </p>
<p>Article 6.1(b): Any such project provides a reduction in emissions by sources,
  or an enhancement of removals by sinks, that is <b>additional</b> to any that
  would otherwise occur. </p>
<p>Article 12.2: The purpose of the clean development mechanism shall be to assist
  Parties not included in Annex I in achieving sustainable development and in
  contributing to the ultimate objective of the Convention, and to assist Parties
  included in Annex I in achieving compliance with their quantified emission limitation
  and reduction commitments under Article 3. </p>
<p>Article 12.3(a): Parties not included in Annex I will benefit from <b>project
  activities</b> resulting in <b>certified emissions reductions</b>. </p>
<p>Article 12.3(b): Parties included in Annex I may use the <b>certified emissions
  reductions </b>accruing from such project activities to contribute to compliance
  with part of their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments
  under Article 3, as determined by the Conference of the Parties serving as the
  meeting of the Parties to the Protocol. </p>
<p>Article 12.5: Emissions reductions resulting from each project activity shall
  be certified by operational entities to be designated by the COP serving as
  the meeting of the Parties to this Protocol, on the basis of: </p>
<p>Article 12.5(b): Real, <b>measurable</b>, and <b>long-term </b>benefits related
  to the mitigation of climate change. </p>
<p>Article 12.5(c): Reductions in emissions that are <b>additional</b> to any
  that would occur in the absence of the certified project. </p>
