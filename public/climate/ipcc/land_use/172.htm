<h3>4.4.2. Cropland Management </h3>
<p>The current global arable land area is approximately 1.5 Gha, or 11 percent
  of total terrestrial area (FAO, 1999). Most of the carbon stocks in croplands
  are in the soil because of frequent biomass removal during harvest. Soils now
  contain about 8-10 percent of total global carbon stocks (Cole <i>et al.</i>,
  1993). For the purposes of this Special Report, arable land is divided into
  conventional (aerobic) systems and (anaerobic) paddy rice systems. The remainder
  is classified as agroforestry and degraded lands, which are discussed as separate
  activities. </p>
<p>The conversion of natural systems to cultivated agriculture results in losses
  of soil organic carbon on the order of 20-50 percent from the pre-cultivation
  stocks in the surface 1 m (Davidson and Ackerman, 1993; Cole <i>et al.</i>,
  1997; Paustian <i>et al.</i>, 1997a; Lal and Bruce, 1999). Loss rates are higher
  during the first years of cultivation and then tend to level off after 20-50
  years (Díaz-Raviña <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Lal <i>et al.</i>, 1998). There are
  several exceptions to this rule. One is with paddy cultivation (flooded for
  extended periods), where decomposition rates are retarded, thereby maintaining
  or increasing carbon stocks (Greenland, 1985; Bronson <i>et al.</i>, 1997).
  In contrast, when organic soils (Histosols) are drained and brought into cultivation,
  losses of soil carbon may continue as long as the soil is exposed (Lal <i>et
  al.</i>, 1998). When arid or semi-arid soils are brought under irrigation, increased
  organic matter input from roots and crop residues may increase soil carbon stocks
  (Leuking and Schepers, 1985). This increase could be partially offset by a concomitant
  increase in residue decomposition resulting from added moisture. On a global
  basis, the cumulative historic loss of carbon from agricultural soils has been
  estimated at 55 Gt C (IPCC, 1996b)-nearly one third of total carbon loss from
  soils and vegetation (150 Gt C) (Houghton, 1995). <br>
  Studies suggest that most of the world's agricultural soils have not reached
  saturation of their carbon stocks; therefore, most soils are potential carbon
  sinks (Kern and Johnson, 1993; Donigian <i>et al.</i>, 1995). Future increases
  in carbon stocks are likely to be smaller in areas that have been highly productive
  during past decades than in areas that currently are experiencing sharp increases
  in crop yields, as well as those moving into conservation tillage; the magnitude
  of these increases is highly dependent on inputs and management, however. Barriers
  to adoption of soil carbon-enhancing activities include a perceived lack of
  profitability and land managers' lack of understanding and acceptance of improved
  techniques for controlling pests and weeds, applying fertilizers, and switching
  to crop varieties that are matched to different soil moisture and temperature
  conditions. Because these barriers are addressable by public policies and programs,
  increasing the adoption of cropland management activities appears to be an opportunity
  for a broad range of Parties. Virtually everything that occurs in arable lands
  is "human-induced;" therefore, that criterion, if chosen, should pose no technical
  difficulty with regard to these activities. </p>
<p>Global warming is expected to increase yields in higher latitude cropland zones
  by virtue of longer growing seasons and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fertilization (Cantagallo <i>et
  al.</i>, 1997; Travasso <i>et al.</i>, 1999). At the same time, however, global
  warming may also accelerate decomposition of carbon already stored in soils
  (Jenkinson, 1991; MacDonald <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Niklinska <i>et al.</i>, 1999;
  Scholes <i>et al.</i>, 1999). The net effect of these changes on carbon sequestration
  in croplands is likely to impact some geographic areas more than others, but
  there are no reliable estimates of those future impacts. Although much work
  remains to be done in quantifying the CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fertilization effect in cropland,
  van Ginkel et al. (1999) estimate the magnitude of this effect (at current rates
  of increase of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> in the atmosphere) at 0.036 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in temperate grassland,
  even after the effect of rising temperature on decomposition is deducted. </p>
<p>Efforts to improve soil quality and raise SOC levels have been grouped into
  three practices: agricultural intensification, conservation tillage, and erosion
  reduction. Agricultural intensification (<a href="173.htm">Section 4.4.2.1</a>)
  involves the use of improved water management, new or higher yielding varieties,
  integrated pest management, judicious use of organic and inorganic amendments,
  crop rotations, and other sound technologies that are available now, except
  for conservation tillage. Conservation tillage (<a href="174.htm">Section 4.4.2.2</a>)
  includes various forms of reduced tillage and is discussed as a distinct practice
  because of its specific effects of accumulating soil carbon and reducing soil
  erosion. Soil erosion control and improved water management are discussed in
  <a href="175.htm">Section 4.4.2.3</a>. Care has been taken so the areas listed
  under each practice are not double-counted. </p>
