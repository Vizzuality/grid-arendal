<h4>2.4.1.1. Uncertainty, Precision, Accuracy, and Costs </h4>
<p>There is a widespread perception that accounting for carbon in the biosphere
  is inherently more difficult than accounting for carbon emitted by the burning
  of fossil fuels. This perception is only partly true. Determining the amount
  of carbon held in vegetation and soils does not require measurement of all of
  the carbon in all areas. Well-established statistical sampling techniques such
  as stratification and random sampling can be used to determine the carbon stocks
  of the biosphere as precisely and accurately as would be possible with complete
  measurement. </p>
<p>Neither accuracy (the absence of bias) nor precision (how well a measurement
  can be repeated) is compromised when appropriate statistical methods are used.
  Nevertheless, in statistical sampling there is a tradeoff between precision
  and effort (cost). A greater number of samples reduces error (i.e., increases
  precision) in the estimate but also requires more effort. In fact, each successive
  increment in precision requires a proportionately greater increase in effort.
  The decision about whether or how precisely to measure a carbon sink will depend
  on the effort required for that precision and the magnitude of the expected
  sink. Small changes in carbon or changes that require a large effort for measurement
  may not be worth the effort. <a href="077.htm#table2-7">Table 2-7</a> gives
  the costs of different methods in US$ per hectare for project-level measurements.
  Costs per ton of carbon are not given because the costs vary from country to
  country not only with the desired precision but with the types of land-use change
  and the magnitude of the change in carbon per unit area. Thus, costs per ton
  of carbon at the national level must be determined for each country individually.
  Similarly, the combination of methods most appropriate for national-level estimates
  of change will vary for each country; we do not attempt to suggest a single
  appropriate combination. </p>
<p>There are at least two significant generic problems with the estimation of
  change in terrestrial biospheric carbon stocks. The first problem relates to
  resolution (i.e., the smallest detectable change). Because the rate of change
  of most biospheric pools is slow, particularly in relation to the size of the
  pool, resolvable changes in stock are typically not easily obtained for the
  larger pools. </p>
<p>The second problem is practical. Most countries do not have the established
  infrastructure required for regular measurement of biospheric carbon (although
  all Annex I countries have a regular forest inventory in place). Where no infrastructure
  exists, measurement of carbon to the required degree of precision and accuracy
  is an expensive and logistically complex exercise. Most of the developed countries,
  as well as some less developed countries, have at least part of the required
  infrastructure already in place: certifiable analytical laboratories equipped
  to measure the carbon content of soils and biomass; a national forest and soil
  inventory system; accurate soil and vegetation maps on which to base the sample
  stratification; trained field, analytical, and statistical staff; and a physical
  infrastructure that allows access to remote sites. Even where this capacity
  exists, the incremental cost of performing a national-scale carbon inventory
  may be substantial. Australia, for example, is investing an additional $5 million
  annually in anticipation of upgrading its carbon accounting system for the Kyoto
  Protocol. The costs may be greater in countries in which the inventory infrastructure
  is less well developed. The use of models and stratified and multi-objective
  sample programs may reduce these costs, however. </p>
<p>The cost of conducting biospheric carbon inventories depends on the size of
  the area inventoried-but more on the range of ecological conditions within it
  because the spatial scale over which soil and biomass carbon varies is quite
  small: a few tens to hundreds of meters. The sample size needed to achieve the
  desired precision may be similar for a small country and a distinct region within
  a large country. Both need approximately the same analytical equipment and statistical
  treatment. Thus, the cost to a country will depend more on the range of different
  bio-geophysical regions that exist within its borders than on its actual size.
</p>
<p>The total inventory costs for a single project will be substantially less than
  the inventory costs for an entire country, but the cumulative cost of inventorying
  several projects soon reaches the level of a national inventory. This is because
  the costs of forest inventory vary considerably depending on the desired accuracy,
  the accessibility of the forest, the availability of pre-information, the degree
  of automation employed, the availability of allometric relations, and so forth.
  At a typical project scale of tens of thousands of hectares, the costs are on
  the order of US$11-18 ha<sup>-1</sup> (Nabuurs <i>et al.</i>, 1999). The typical cost of
  a national forest inventory, on the other hand, is on the order of US$0.05-0.6
  ha<sup>-1</sup>. Costs are declining with the increased use of automated data collection
  and analysis (see also <a href="077.htm#table2-7">Table 2-7</a>). </p>
<p>The methods for determining changes in carbon storage are described briefly
  in the following sections. These methods are divided into methods for the measurement
  of stocks, the measurement of flux, and the measurement of area, as well as
  models. <a href="077.htm#table2-7">Table 2-7</a> summarizes the characteristics
  of different methods. </p>
