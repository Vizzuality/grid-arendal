<h4>2.3.2.5. Accounting Under the Kyoto Protocol Compared to Full Carbon Accounting
</h4>
<p>The term "full carbon accounting" can be used to imply complete accounting
  for changes in carbon stocks across all carbon pools, landscape units, and time
  periods. In this Special Report, "full carbon accounting" means complete accounting
  of stock changes in all carbon pools related to a given set of landscape units
  in a given time period. When complete coverage over the landscape and/or time
  is intended, that interpretation will be stated explicitly. Note that a carbon
  pool (e.g., forest products) can be related to a landscape unit without being
  physically located on the site. Policy options to account for these wood product
  pools are discussed in <a href="301.htm">Section 6.2.2</a>. </p>
<p>The land-based accounting rule in <a href="062.htm#table2-3">Table 2-3</a>
  can capture full carbon accounting over pools, landscape units, and time as
  a special case in which the summation covers all carbon pools and all landscape
  units, and contiguous commitment periods extend into the indefinite future.
  The Kyoto Protocol, on the other hand, mandates that accounting be restricted
  to certain "human-induced" activities. Full carbon accounting over pools and
  time could nonetheless be applied to landscape units that constitute Kyoto land
  by virtue of being subject to specified human-induced activities. </p>
<h4><a name="s2-3-2-6"></a>2.3.2.6. Timing of Commitment Periods </h4>
<p>There is a 17-year gap between the end of the base year (1990) and the beginning
  of the first year of the first commitment period (2008). Although any relevant
  LULUCF activities that occur during that time span would enter into the Kyoto
  accounting system, the effect of those activities is confined to impacts on
  carbon stocks during the 2008-2012 commitment period. This situation raises
  the possibility that a Party could draw down carbon stocks prior to the commitment
  period (e.g., through forest clearing) and later obtain credit for carbon accumulated
  during the first and future commitment periods on forests established after
  1990 (Schlamadinger and Marland, 1998). Conversely, for land forested after
  1990 and harvested during a commitment period, the debits from the stock decrease
  could exceed the previously earned credits because stock increases prior to
  2008 would not be counted. Options for addressing these situations are discussed
  in <a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a>. Similar situations could arise if future
  commitment periods are not contiguous. </p>
<h4><a name="s2-3-2-7"></a>2.3.2.7. Greenhouse Gases Other than CO<span class="subscript">2</span> </h4>
<p>The accounting rules described here focus only on emissions and removals of
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, which can be measured as changes in carbon stocks. Emissions of methane
  and nitrous oxide from many land-use activities are included in Annex A of the
  Kyoto Protocol and therefore will be captured in the national inventories of
  Annex I Parties. Emissions of these gases related to forestry activities may
  not be captured, however. As described in <a href="014.htm">Chapter 1</a>, forestry
  activities can affect emissions and removals of methane and nitrous oxide. If
  these effects are not considered, the full impact of forestry activities may
  not be reflected in the Kyoto accounting system. Similarly, to accurately assess
  the climate benefits of projects in non-Annex I Parties, changes in methane
  and nitrous oxide emissions/removals would have to be considered explicitly.
