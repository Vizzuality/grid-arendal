<h4>1.3.2.5. Spatial and Temporal Integration </h4>
<p>Measurements of NEP are demanding of resources, therefore still are not numerous.
  They also are not always representative for the whole growing season, and they
  are never representative for the whole life cycle of longer lived plants. Few
  observational series extend over more than 5 years. Within decades, a forest
  site that was chosen for measuring NEP will likely enter a different phase or
  be subjected to natural disturbances such as fire, pests, and wind-throw or
  management operations such as thinning and felling. Although measurements made
  from satellites may suggest that NPP has been increasing over the past decades
  in some regions and measurements of NEP may seem to indicate that many forests
  are significant carbon sinks, when the effects of disturbances are included
  the sequestration of carbon into these forests may be significantly less or
  even, in some areas, close to zero. Importantly, the disturbances themselves
  may be influenced by climate, and a change in the disturbance regime may turn
  a positive NBP into a negative one-or vice versa. For example, measurements
  of NEP in Canadian boreal forests suggest that many of these forests are carbon
  sinks (see <a href="029.htm">Section 1.3.2.3</a>), but estimates of NBP from
  measurement of changes in disturbance regimes and consideration of forest stand
  dynamics indicate that NBP may have declined significantly over the past 3 decades
  and that these forests, over large areas, are close to being carbon neutral
  (Walker <i>et al.</i>, 1999). With the limited empirical data available, however,
  it is difficult to derive accurate local estimates of NBP for regions, biomes,
  countries, or continents from spatial and temporal integration of the constituent
  processes and disturbances (Schulze <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Houghton <i>et al.</i>,
  2000). Our restricted ability to build estimates of NBP from its components
  at the present time defines a gap in our knowledge and the need to use other
  methodologies. </p>
<p>If the values in the preceding sections are considered representative for the
  major forest biomes-tropical, temperate, and boreal forests, respectively-and
  for the total area that they cover (approximately 40 x 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup>), total NEP for
  these systems would be about 10 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>. However, global NBP, derived as the
  difference between the output resulting from fossil fuel burning, on the one
  hand, and the increase of atmospheric concentrations and net ocean uptake, on
  the other, is currently a little less than about 1 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> (see <a href="020.htm#table1-2">Table
  1-2</a>). If the effects of land-use change are excluded from this estimate
  of NBP, the estimate of global NBP increases to about 2-3 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>-about five
  times less than the total NEP (see <a href="021.htm">Section 1.2.1.4</a>). Thus,
  NEP values as reported so far are clearly not representative of the large-scale,
  long-term storage of carbon. This fact emphasizes the importance of viewing
  the activities defined in Articles 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol in a large-scale
  and long-term perspective. </p>
<p>Recent attempts to determine the large-scale distribution of terrestrial sources
  and sinks (i.e., NBP) indirectly, on the basis of the observed spatial variation
  of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, have interpreted low values as
  indications of net uptake and high values as the presence of net sources (Fan
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Bousquet <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Rayner <i>et al.</i>, 2000).
  In light of the relatively small magnitude of the regional NBP, this determination
  requires accurate knowledge about both the spatial distribution of carbon dioxide
  concentrations and its horizontal and vertical transport as a result of air
  motions. The inverse modeling analyses of Rayner <i>et al.</i> (2000) and Bousquet
  <i>et al.</i> (1999) agree reasonably closely in indicating a net terrestrial
  carbon sink in Siberia and comparable, smaller net sinks in North America and
  Europe, with small net sources in South America and Africa. </p>
