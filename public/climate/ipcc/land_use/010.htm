<h4>7. Project-Based Activities </h4>
<ol start="69">
  <li>An LULUCF project can be defined as a planned set of activities aimed at
    reducing greenhouse gas emissions or enhancing carbon stocks that is confined
    to one or more geographic locations in the same country and specified time
    period and institutional frameworks such as to allow net greenhouse gas emissions
    or enhancing carbon stocks to be monitored and verified. Experience is being
    gained in Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) and other LULUCF projects that
    are under initial stages of implementation in at least 19 countries. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Assessment of the experience of these projects is constrained by the small
    number, the limited range of project types, the uneven geographic distribution,
    the short period of field operations to date, and the absence of an internationally
    agreed set of guidelines and methods to establish baselines and quantify emissions
    and uptake. Generally, these projects do not report all greenhouse gas emissions
    or estimate leakage, and few have independent review. <br>

<ol start="71">
  <li>However, through the experience of LULUCF projects aimed to mitigate climate
    change, it is possible in some cases to develop approaches to address some
    of the critical issues (see<a href="#table5">Table 5</a>). <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>There are 10 projects aimed at decreasing emissions through avoiding deforestation
    and improving forest management, and 11 projects aimed at increasing the uptake
    of carbon-mostly forest projects in tropical countries (see <a href="#table5">Table
    5</a>). [<a href="253.htm">5.2.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Methods of financial analysis among these projects have not been comparable.
    Moreover the cost calculations do not cover, in most instances, inter alia,
    costs for infrastructure, monitoring, data collection and interpretation costs,
    opportunity costs of land and maintenance, or other recurring costs, which
    are often excluded or overlooked. Recognizing the different methods used,
    the undiscounted cost and investment estimates range from $US 0.1-28 per ton
    of carbon, simply dividing project cost by their total reported accumulated
    carbon uptake or estimated emissions avoided, assuming no leakage outside
    the project boundaries. [<a href="254.htm">5.2.3</a>]<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Project-level financial analysis methods are widely used and fairly standardized
    in development assistance and private investment projects. But they have yet
    to be consistently applied to, and reported for, LULUCF projects aiming at
    mitigating climate change. Guidelines for developing methods of financial
    analysis may be needed in the future. [<a href="254.htm">5.2.3</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>LULUCF projects aiming to mitigate climate change may provide socioeconomic
    and environmental benefits primarily within project boundaries, although they
    may also pose risks of negative impacts. Experience from most of the pilot
    projects to date indicates that involvement of local stakeholders in the design
    and management of project activities is often critical. Other factors affecting
    the capacity of projects to increase carbon uptake and avoid greenhouse gas
    emissions and to have other benefits include consistency with national and/or
    international sustainable development goals, and institutional and technical
    capacity to develop and implement project guidelines and safeguards. [<a href="104.htm">2.5.2</a>,
    <a href="286.htm">5.6</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The accounting of changes in carbon stocks and net greenhouse gas emissions
    involve a determination that project activities lead to changes in carbon
    stocks and net greenhouse gas emissions that are additional to a without-project
    baseline. Currently there is no standard method for determining baselines
    and additionality. Approaches include determining project-specific baselines
    or generic benchmarks. Most AIJ projects have used a project-specific approach
    that has an advantage of using better knowledge of local conditions yielding
    more accurate prediction. A disadvantage is that project developers may choose
    scenarios that maximize their projected benefits. Baselines may be fixed throughout
    the duration of a project or periodically adjusted. Baseline adjustments would
    ensure more realistic estimates of changes in carbon uptake or greenhouse
    gas emissions but would create uncertainties for project developers. [<a href="258.htm">5.3.2</a>,
    <a href="259.htm#table5-4">Table 5-4</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Projects that reduce access to land, food, fiber, fuel, and timber resources
    without offering alternatives may result in carbon leakage as people find
    needed supplies elsewhere. A few pilot projects have been designed with the
    aim of reducing leakage by explicitly incorporating components that supply
    the resource needs of local communities (e.g., establishing fuelwood plantations
    to reduce pressures on other forests), and that provide socioeconomic benefits
    that create incentives to maintain the project. Due to leakage, the overall
    consideration of the climate change mitigation effects of a project may require
    assessments beyond the project boundary, as addressed in paragraph 49. [<a href="059.htm">2.3</a>,
    <a href="263.htm">5.3.3</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Project accounting and monitoring methods could be matched with project
    conditions to address leakage issues. If leakage is likely to be small, then
    the monitoring area can be set roughly equal to the project area. Conversely,
    where leakage is likely to be significant the monitoring area could be expanded
    beyond the project area, although this would be more difficult when the leakage
    occurs across national boundaries. Two possible approaches could then be used
    to estimate leakage. One would be to monitor key indicators of leakage, and
    the second would be to use standard risk coefficients developed for project
    type and region. In either case, leakage could be quantified and subsequently
    changes in carbon stock and greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the project
    could be reestimated. The effectiveness of these two approaches is untested.
    [<a href="263.htm">5.3.3</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>LULUCF projects raise a particular issue with respect to permanence (see
    paragraph 40). Different approaches have been proposed to address the duration
    of projects in relation to their ability to increase carbon stocks and decrease
    greenhouse gas emissions, inter alia: (i) They should be maintained in perpetuity
    because their "reversal" at any point in time could invalidate a project;
    and (ii) they should be maintained until they counteract the effect of an
    equivalent amount of greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere. [<a href="267.htm">5.3.4</a>]
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Several approaches could be used to estimate the changes in carbon stocks
    and greenhouse gas emissions of LULUCF projects: (i) estimating carbon stocks
    and greenhouse gas emissions at a given point in time; (ii) estimating the
    average changes of carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions over time in
    a project area; or (iii) allowing for only a part of the total changes in
    carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions for each year that the project is
    maintained (e.g., tonne-year method). The year-to-year distribution of changes
    in carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions over the project duration varies
    according to the accounting method used. [<a href="273.htm">5.4.2</a>, <a href="276.htm#table5-9">Table
    5-9</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>LULUCF projects are subject to a variety of risks because of their exposure
    to natural and anthropogenic factors. Some of these risks particularly pertain
    to land-use activities (e.g., fires, extreme meteorological events, and pests
    for forests), while others are applicable to greenhouse gas mitigation projects
    in both LULUCF and energy sectors such as political and economic risks. Risk
    reduction could be addressed through a variety of approaches internal to the
    project, such as introduction of good practice management systems, diversification
    of project activities and funding sources, self-insurance reserves, involvement
    of local stakeholders, external auditing, and verification. External approaches
    for risk reduction include standard insurance services, regional carbon pools,
    and portfolio diversification. [<a href="269.htm">5.3.5</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Techniques and tools exist to measure carbon stocks in project areas relatively
    precisely depending on the carbon pool. However, the same level of precision
    for the climate change mitigation effects of the project may not be achievable
    because of difficulties in establishing baselines and due to leakage. Currently,
    there are no guidelines as to the level of precision to which pools should
    be measured and monitored. Precision and cost of measuring and monitoring
    are related. Preliminary limited data on measured and monitored relevant aboveground
    and below-ground carbon pools to precision levels of about 10% of the mean
    at a cost of about US$1-5 per hectare and US$0.10-0.50 per ton of carbon have
    been reported. Qualified independent third-party verification could play an
    essential role in ensuring unbiased monitoring. [<a href="270.htm#s5-4-1">5.4.1</a>,
