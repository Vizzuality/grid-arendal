<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.20. Sequestration/Displacement Tradeoff</h3>
<p>This Fact Sheet illustrates the sequestration/displacement tradeoff discussed
  in <a href="206.htm">Section 4.5.2</a>. </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  Most of the projects under the Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) phase have
  involved sequestration rather than displacement. This situation reflects the
  reality that the pattern of response is influenced by the time horizon: Displacement
  of fossil fuel emerges as more effective only in the long run (Marland and Schlamadinger,
  1997). Projects such as these provide a future opportunity for biofuel and forest
  products in the long term. This future potential does not mean that different
  (additional) land is needed later. The tradeoff is not a once-for-all choice
  but a dynamic process; the pattern will shift from initial long-rotation sequestration
  to eventual short rotation-based displacement of fossil fuel (<a href="#figure4-15">Figure
  4-15</a>). In <a href="#figure4-15">Figure 4-15</a>, Read (1999) has modeled
  a 70-year projection of the impact on GHG levels, relative to two reference
  scenarios-business-as-usual (IPCC, 1992) and fossil-free (Greenpeace, 1993)-on
  two patterns of land-use changes: enhanced biofuel alone and "buffer stock"
  sequestration plus enhanced biofuel. The latter leads, by about 2040, to ~4
  Gt C annual absorption and a cumulative reduction of ~40 ppm CO<span class="subscript">2</span> in the atmosphere.
  This effort implies an ambitious program of sustainable development pursued
  consistently over several decades and involving a large number of community-scaled
  plantations (Read, 1999). It has only a modest effect in 2008-2012. </p>

	  two reference scenarios [business-as-usual (BAU) and fossil-free energy

<p>Biomass growth absorbs CO<span class="subscript">2</span> that is returned to atmosphere after felling-either
  immediately when it is used as biofuel or more slowly when it is used in conventional
  forest products, from paper to timber. Long-term removals from atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  result from substitution in the commercial energy and forest product system,
  with fossil fuel left underground or biodiverse natural forests-which might
  otherwise be lost-left standing. </p>
<p><b>Current Knowledge and Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  Modeling of land-use change dynamics is in its infancy and has so far been performed
  only in global (one region) simulations. Multi-region simulations are expected
  to show improved outcomes when the buffer stock is focused on industrialized
  regions, where sunk costs in energy sector infrastructure investments are very
  large (and where populations are largely urbanized, with surplus agricultural
  land and only minor rural unemployment). </p>
<p><b>Time Scale </b><br>
  The tradeoff involves a several decade dynamic process of land-use change that
  lasts several decades. </p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, and Transparency </b><br>
  Because monitoring processes are required under the CDM, verification in developing
  countries would be covered by arrangements for project-related carbon credits.
  Verification of these essentially commercial activities in industrialized countries
  would also be covered by commercial accounting procedures, subject to disclosure
  requirements. </p>
<p><b>Permanence</b><br>
  Although sequestration is of limited duration, the related CO<span class="subscript">2</span> mitigation is
  not necessarily impermanent because carbon credit creation is a commercial activity
  that will not leave mature timber from the sequestration phase to rot on felling.
  It will be used either in lieu of timber from biodiverse natural forest or as
  biofuel or in lieu of fossil fuel-intensive materials. Thus, permanence resides
  in fossil fuel left underground or natural forest left undisturbed. </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  Investing in "buffer stock" forestry is a low-cost, low-risk option, precautionary
  against climate science finding a low threshold GHG level for a dangerous "rapid
  non-linear climate change event" (Houghton, 1998). Carbon stored in new forest
  provides greater flexibility, enabling possible responses to bad news from lower
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> levels and providing raw material for a rapid shift to "back-stop" biofuel
  technology, if needed. If no threshold is revealed, the new forests can be left
  to grow to maturity to meet demands for timber, avoiding depletion of biodiverse
  natural forests. </p>
