<h3>5.2.1. Quantifying Project Activities: Issues and Methods (continued) </h3>
<p>About 3.5 Mha of land are currently included in LULUCF GHG mitigation projects
  being implemented in 19 countries (see <a href="253.htm">Section 5.2.2</a>).
  Assessment of the experience of LULUCF mitigation projects is constrained by
  the small number of these projects, the limited range of project types, uneven
  geographic distribution, and the short period of field operations to date. The
  first publicized LULUCF mitigation or carbon offset project began in 1988: the
  CARE-AES Guatemala community forestry project (Trexler <i>et al.</i>, 1989;
  Faeth <i>et al.</i>, 1994). </p>
<p>Most reviews of LULUCF climate change mitigation project experience to date
  are simply summaries of information reported by individual projects or AIJ programs
  (e.g., Dixon <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Stuart and Moura-Costa, 1998; EPA/USIJI, 1998;
  FACE, 1998; UNFCCC, 1998). A few studies review or analyze several project case
  studies (e.g., Faeth <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Brown <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Brown <i>et
  al.</i>, 1997; Goldberg, 1998; Imaz <i>et al.</i>,1998; Witthoeft-Muehlmann,
  1999). Several projects have been well documented. The Rio Bravo conservation
  and alternative forest management project in Belize, for example, has produced
  a set of operational protocols (Programme for Belize, 1997b). These protocols
  include descriptions of the project's reference case, leakage assessment, a
  sustainable forest management strategy (including boundary security and fire
  management), estimates of GHG benefits, baseline, and monitoring plan. These
  protocols have been filed with the U.S. Initiative for Joint Implementation
  (USIJI) program, along with other project documents (EPA/USIJI, 1998). </p>
<p>No internationally agreed set of guidelines and methods-comparable to the Organisation
  for Economic Cooperation and Development/Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
  Change (OECD/IPCC) <i>Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
  Inventories</i>-exists to quantify GHG emissions and sequestration, baselines,
  socioeconomic and environmental impact assessment, and reporting of project
  activities (Andrasko <i>et al</i>, 1996; Swisher, 1997). Such guidelines and
  methods are urgently needed if projects are to be reported consistently and
  credibly under several Articles of the Kyoto Protocol (see <a href="293.htm">Chapter
  6</a>). </p>
<p>Project data reported in the literature use a wide range of methods and, for
  the most part, have not been independently verified. Thus, comparing data across
  projects is difficult. Evaluations of project GHG accounting by different analysts
  are likely to produce estimated GHG benefits that are different from the estimates
  of project developers, because GHG accounting methods have not yet been standardized.
  Analysts and project developers are building on early experience to alter the
  design of projects; they are beginning to produce data-driven baselines in some
  cases and revise project estimates of sequestration or avoided emissions. </p>
<p><a href="#table5-1">Table 5-1</a> compares the initial baseline and net GHG
  benefits estimated by project developers during the planning phase and reported
  to the USIJI program (see <a href="253.htm">Section 5.2.2</a>) for two large
  projects, along with later evaluations by other entities. These projects were
  conceived in the voluntary, non-credit, exploratory AIJ phase, where steep learning
  curves were experienced. As <a href="#table5-1">Table 5-1</a> illustrates, estimated
  GHG benefits have tended to decrease over time as methods and initial assumptions
  have been refined and applied to a given project (e.g., Busch <i>et al.</i>,
  1999; Brown <i>et al.</i>, 2000). If standardized methods are introduced, estimates
  should tend to vary mainly as changes occur in project conditions or land uses
  or with the availability of new data. Over the next 5 years or so, early projects
  will begin measuring and monitoring their performance, replacing earlier estimates
  of project baselines and GHG benefits with field data collected for the purpose
  of monitoring. Reported GHG benefits could change as well if verification of
  GHG reductions occurs and the results are significantly different from previous
  estimates.<br>
  This chapter surveys projects that were in early or later stages of implementation
  by 1999 (i.e., projects that have been at least partially funded and have begun
  activities on the ground that will generate GHG benefits). It focuses on LULUCF
  projects formally reported to the UNFCCC AIJ Pilot Phase program (17 projects,
  as of late 1998), as well as more than a dozen other projects (Trexler <i>et
  al.</i>, 1999; UNFCCC, 1999b). The AIJ program was established in 1995 by Decision
  5/CP.1 of the first Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC as a voluntary
  program to experiment with concepts of joint implementation that evolved during
  the negotiation of the UNFCCC (UNFCCC, 1995). Many projects have not been reported
  to the voluntary AIJ program, which precludes transfer of emissions reduction
  or avoidance credits to Parties. Unreported projects often began prior to the
  AIJ program and faced reluctance by host countries to grant formal acceptance,
  as well as a lack of incentives for investors or developers to report. One review
  identified 18 offset projects underway in 14 countries that have not been reported
  to the AIJ program (Trexler <i>et al.</i>,1999). </p>
