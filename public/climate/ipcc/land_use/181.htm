<h4>4.4.3.5. Fire Management</h4>
<p>Fire is often an essential management tool in grasslands of the tropics and
  arid zones for controlling woody weeds, removing dead biomass, clearing land,
  stimulating grass growth and palatability, hunting, and controlling wildfires
  and pests (Follett <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Fires can also occur naturally through
  lightning strike. In some places (e.g., Africa and Australia), humans have been
  setting grassland fires for millennia, and humans can be considered the historically
  dominant ignition source. In many regions, if managed burns are not implemented,
  a fire will eventually occur from non-human ignition sources. These two observations
  illustrate the operational difficulty in attributing pyrogenic emissions to
  natural or human influence. </p>
<p>Fires transfer a significant portion of aboveground carbon and other material-as
  well as smaller portions of below-ground materials-into the atmosphere. Emissions
  of methane, non-methane hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and
  particles also occur. Burning therefore represents a short-term transfer of
  carbon from grassland ecosystems to the atmosphere; under an unchanging fire
  regime, this carbon transfer is balanced by subsequent regrowth of vegetation
  prior to the next fire (Follett <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Increasing fire frequency
  over time tends to reduce grass biomass production through loss of soil nitrogen
  (e.g., Scholes and Walker, 1993; Kauffman <i>et al.</i>, 1994); in conjunction
  with enhancement of decomposition processes (Knapp et al., 1998), this effect
  results in declines in soil carbon pools (Jones <i>et al.</i>, 1990). In some
  grasslands, however, burning frequency appears to have little impact on grass
  biomass pools (e.g., Senthilkumar <i>et al.</i>, 1998), whereas in other grasslands
  changing the season of burning can substantially alter grassland productivity
  and biomass pools (Cox and Morton, 1986). </p>
<p>Changes in fire management, often in association with increased grazing pressure,
  can also influence the vegetation dynamics of grasslands and result in long-term
  changes in structure and carbon pools (Scholes and Hall, 1996; Scholes and Archer,
  1997). Management that removes fire from previously burned landscapes will tend
  to increase the woody components, resulting in large increases in carbon pools
  in biomass and soil (e.g., San Jose <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Burrows <i>et al.</i>,
  1999). This increase in woody vegetation cover is occurring in many grasslands
  throughout the world (reviewed in Archer <i>et al.</i>, 1995), largely in response
  to management change. Other factors, such as climatic variations, are sometimes
  significant in the establishment and removal of woody species (e.g., Fensham,
  1998). Atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> increases probably have not had major effects to date
  (Archer <i>et al.</i>, 1995; Howden <i>et al.</i>, 1999), although there is
  some dispute over this point (e.g., Polley <i>et al.</i>, 1997). The usefulness
  of areas with increased woody biomass for other purposes (e.g., grazing, thatch
  production) will often decline as a result of reductions in grass productivity
  and species changes (e.g., Burrows <i>et al.</i>, 1990). Current aspirations
  to return to more sustainable grazing systems are likely to result in increased
  burning opportunities to manage woody vegetation (Hall <i>et al.</i>, 1998).
  In many ecosystems, fauna and non-woody flora species are fire-dependent, and
  removing fires will result in loss of biodiversity (e.g., Edroma, 1986); a reduction
  in fire frequency will not necessarily lead to biodiversity loss, although it
  may. </p>
<p>Charcoal generated by fires can constitute 8 g C kg-1 soil and represent up
  to 30 percent of the soil carbon content of some grassland soils (Skjemstad
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996); it probably constitutes a significant part of the inert
  or passive soil carbon pool (Skjemstad <i>et al.</i>, 1996). A small fraction
  of the biomass consumed by fire is converted to black carbon-a highly condensed
  substance that is virtually impervious to decay-part of which may eventually
  end up in oceanic sediments (Verardo and Ruddiman, 1996; Verardo, 1997; Stallard,
  1998). Management that reduces or removes fire will result over centuries in
  reduction of these small but highly stable pools. The net atmospheric consequences
  are unknown. </p>
<p>Fires are routinely monitored with remote sensing. The consequences of altered
  fire regimes on emissions and carbon storage can be modeled (Scholes and van
  der Merwe, 1996; Moore <i>et al.</i>, 1997). Verification of the altered carbon
  stores would require field measurement of woody biomass and soil carbon. Monitoring
  the impacts of changing fire management may be possible, although attribution
  of changes in carbon stores will remain difficult given the complexity of interactions
  between human actions, climate variability, and other environmental factors.
