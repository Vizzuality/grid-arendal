<h3>5.4.5. Verification</h3>
<p>Verification by third-party institutions offers a way to provide confidence
  to governments, investors, project developers, NGOs, and the public at large
  regarding the validity of the carbon benefits claimed by a project. Third-party
  verification could be based on an assessment of the project's compliance with
  defined eligibility criteria. A single set of internationally accepted eligibility
  criteria would facilitate direct comparison of projects, whereas a variety of
  such criteria would result in projects and GHG benefits of differing quality.</p>
<p>Verification activities may include review of data or documentation (e.g.,
  procedures, methodologies, analyses, reports), including interviews with project
  personnel; inspection or calibration of measurement and analytical tools and
  methods; repeat sampling and measurements; assessment of the quality and comprehensiveness
  of the data used in calculating the project baseline and offsets, therefore
  the confidence in the final claims; assessment of risks associated with the
  project as well as the carbon benefits; and the presence or absence of non-GHG
  externalities such as environmental and social impacts. Existing programs describe
  alternative ways that verification could be accomplished. Notable elements of
  these alternative programs include periodic verification of project performance
  against defined criteria (EcoSecurities, 1997; Trines, 1998b; Moura-Costa <i>et
  al.</i>, 2000); an external evaluation panel, site visits, and third-party inspections
  (USIJI, 1996); and designation of verifiers by the proposer (World Business
  Council for a Sustainable Development, 1997). </p>
<p>Unlike projects in other sectors, the carbon stocks of LULUCF projects may
  require verification and monitoring beyond the project time horizon. The verification
  period will depend on the method chosen for accounting of carbon stocks (see
  <a href="273.htm">Section 5.4.2</a>). The carbon stock method may require verification
  until the end of the project; the average net carbon storage method may need
  verification in perpetuity. The ton-year approach may require verification for
  periods ranging from the project lifetime to some specified time period beyond
  the project lifetime, depending on the specifics of the accounting method chosen.</p>
<p>There has been little experience to date with third-party verification of the
  carbon stock of projects (Moura-Costa <i>et al.</i>, 2000). The Forest Stewardship
  Council (FSC) offers a model, however, for how verification might be accomplished
  and how verifiers might be accredited by an independent accreditation body.
  The FSC accredits organizations that inspect forest operations and grants labels
  certifying that the timber has been produced from well-managed forests. The
  FSC is funded by organizations other than the industries it monitors. Other
  institutions, such as SGS, are establishing certification councils with similar
  responsibilities. </p>
<p>The costs of verification by third parties can be alleviated by taking several
  steps: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A single set of eligibility criteria accompanied by standardized accounting
    and reporting methodologies will reduce the costs of developing such services.</li>
  <li>Definition of acceptable confidence intervals will enable project developers
    to maximize their sampling efficiency and enable verifiers to minimize their
    costs.</li>
  <li>Development of "group verification programs," which have been successful
    in other sectors, can make verification available to small-scale projects.</li>
</ul>
