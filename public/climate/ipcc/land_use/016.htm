<h4>Assessing Carbon Stocks and Their Change Over Time </h4>
<ul>
  <li> A sustainably managed forest comprising all stages in the stand life cycle
    operates as a functional system that maintains an overall carbon balance,
    retaining a part in the growing trees, transferring another part into the
    soils, and exporting carbon as forest products. Recently disturbed and regenerating
    areas lose carbon; young stands gain carbon rapidly, mature stands less so;
    and overmature stands may lose carbon. The Kyoto Protocol (Articles 3.3 and
    3.4) focuses on only part of the stand life cycle for a few decades. During
    the early years of the life cycle, when trees are small, the area is likely
    to be a source of carbon; it becomes a sink when carbon assimilation exceeds
    soil respiration. </li>
  <li> Change in the carbon stocks of stands of forest trees over a 5-year period
    (NPP) can be assessed with good precision through standard inventory methods.
    Carbon stocks in soils have been determined by standard sampling techniques,
    but large numbers of samples are required to achieve adequate precision (see
    <a href="032.htm#figure1-4">Figure 1-4</a>). </li>
  <li> Changes in total carbon stocks-vegetation and soils-in forest stands have
    been assessed by direct determination of net sources and sinks (NEP) over
    periods of 1 or more years. This approach has been applied worldwide, predominantly
    to mature forest stands of a range of species and history. The annual NEP
    varies between approximately -1 and 2.5 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for boreal forests,
    2.5 to 7 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for temperate forests, and 1 to 6 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for
    humid tropical forests. </li>
  <li> At present, direct measurements of NEP alone are inadequate to provide
    estimates of NBP because of lack of data covering all stages in the life cycle
    from regeneration to harvest, as well as lack of data on the impacts of disturbances
    such as fire, wind-throw, drought, pollution, pests, and diseases. Thus, forest
    inventories and ecosystem process models, combined with assessments of harvest
    and disturbance-related carbon flows, must be used. These methodologies require
    further development and comparison with measurements of NEP. </li>
  <li> Measurements of NEP on young stands of trees and forest inventory yield
    tables indicate that in new forests planted since 1990 in relation to Article
    3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol, sequestration of carbon is likely to continue for
    20 to 200 years or more after establishment, depending on species and site
    conditions. </li>
  <li> Sequestration of carbon is stimulated by fertilization with atmospheric
    CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and deposition of nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. The
    quantitative contribution of these resources to carbon sequestration is difficult
    to determine and varies from region to region depending on the magnitude of
    nutrient inputs and inputs of associated, negatively acting, pollutants (e.g.,
    acid precipitation or ozone). </li>
  <li> Ecosystem models indicate that the additional terrestrial sink arising
    from global climate change is likely to be maintained in the short term (over
    several decades) if management is appropriate and sustainable, but may gradually
    diminish in the medium term. One reason for this result is that the capacity
    of some ecosystems to sequester carbon may be approached; another is that
    photosynthesis will no longer increase as CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration continues to rise,
    whereas respiration is expected to continue to increase with the rise in temperature.
    A third reason is that trees may begin to die as a result of climate change.
    The balance between forest photosynthesis and respiration is crucially dependent
    on the nutrient dynamics of the forest ecosystem, as well as other environmental
    variables. Because of current limitations on our understanding with respect
    to acclimation of the physiological processes, climatic constraints, and feedbacks
    amongst these processes, particularly those acting at biome scale, projections
    beyond a few decades are highly uncertain. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Impact of Human Activities </h4>
<ul>
  <li> Human activities modify carbon flows between the atmosphere, the land,
    and the oceans. Land use and land-use change are the main factors that affect
    terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon. Clearing of forests has resulted
    in a reduction of the global area of forests by almost 20 percent during the
    past 140 years. Management practices can restore, maintain, and enlarge vegetation
    and soil carbon stocks, however. </li>
  <li> Expansion of agriculture through conversion of forests and grassland during
    the past 140 years has led to a net release of about 121 Gt C, of which about
    60 percent has been emitted in the tropics (primarily during the past half-century)
    and about 40 percent in middle and high latitudes (primarily before the middle
    of the 20th century). During the 1980s, more than 90 percent of the net release
    of carbon to the atmosphere was the result of land-use changes in the tropics.
  </li>
  <li> Reducing the rate of forest clearing can reduce carbon losses from terrestrial
    ecosystems. Establishing forests on previously cleared land provides an opportunity
    to sequester carbon in tree biomass and forest soils, but it will take decades
    to centuries to restore carbon stocks that have been lost as a result of land-use
    change in the past. </li>
  <li> Ecosystem conservation and management practices can restore, maintain,
    and enlarge soil carbon stocks. Forests and wetlands managed as nature reserves
    or recreation areas can sequester significant amounts of carbon. </li>
  <li> On cropland, soil carbon is lost through disturbances of soil by tillage.
    Management practices (e.g., irrigation and application of fertilizers) can
    enhance soil carbon stocks. Application of nitrogen fertilizer in croplands,
    however, probably is the largest human-induced source of the greenhouse gas
    nitrous oxide (N<span class="subscript">2</span>O) at present (see <a href="023.htm">Section 1.2.3</a>).
  </li>
  <li> Global emissions of the greenhouse gases methane (CH<span class="subscript">4</span>) and N<span class="subscript">2</span>O from land
    use-related activities [expressed as CO<span class="subscript">2</span>-equivalents (C-eq)] exceed net CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
    emissions from land-use change. Anthropogenic emissions include 0.9 Gt C-eq
    yr<sup>-1</sup> of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O from cultivated soils, 0.6 Gt C-eq yr<sup>-1</sup> of CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and 0.1 Gt C-eq
    yr<sup>-1</sup> of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O from livestock, 0.3 Gt C-eq yr<sup>-1</sup> of CH<span class="subscript">4</span> from rice paddies, and
    0.2 Gt C-eq yr<sup>-1</sup> of CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and 0.1 Gt C-eq yr<sup>-1</sup> of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O from biomass burning.
    In addition, emissions from forest soils or wetlands, for example, which may
    be considered natural, are affected by land use-related activities that affect
    these ecosystems (see <a href="022.htm#table1-3">Table 1-3</a>). </li>
  <li>Multiple uses of land, while enhancing carbon stocks and producing energy,
    may present opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a minimum
    use of resources. Products made from biomass comprise carbon stocks and present
    an opportunity to substitute for materials that might otherwise lead to larger
    greenhouse gas emissions (see <a href="035.htm">Section 1.4.3</a> and <a href="157.htm">Chapter
    4</a>). Biomass energy can be produced continuously by planting and harvesting,
    thereby reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. The development of new technologies
    for efficient production of biomass energy is essential to keep costs low
    and to secure land in competition for its use for alternative services (see
    <a href="036.htm">Section 1.4.4</a> and <a href="157.htm">Chapter 4</a>).</li>
