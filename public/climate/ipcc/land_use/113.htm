<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p><a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a> focuses on Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol.
  Article 3.3 identifies direct human-induced (DHI) land-use change and forestry
  activities for which Annex I Parties must account greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
  by sources and removals by sinks in the first commitment period. These activities
  are afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation (ARD). The implementation
  of Article 3.3 requires definitions for several terms and decisions on carbon
  accounting rules. <a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a>, which builds on the general
  concepts introduced in <a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a>, identifies issues, describes
  various options to address these issues, and summarizes the implications of
  the options. </p>
<h3>Definitions </h3>
<p>The term "ARD land" is used in this report, for simplicity, to define areas
  on which ARD activities have occurred since 1990 and for which carbon stock
  changes are to be calculated. Key to the identification of ARD lands under Article
  3.3 is the definition of a forest coupled with definitions of afforestation,
  reforestation, and deforestation. The individual definitions of these terms
  addressed in <a href="045.htm#s2-2-2">Sections 2.2.2</a> and <a href="047.htm">2.2.3</a>
  provide a basis for the discussion in this chapter. </p>
<p>This chapter introduces a series of definitional scenarios to illustrate the
  implications of several combinations of different definitions of forest and
  ARD. These scenarios were selected to illustrate the range of possible approaches
  that could be used to define the key terms necessary for implementing Article
  3.3 and the implications of employing these definitions. Although many definitional
  scenarios could have been developed, seven have been chosen and are discussed
  in detail. Two of the definitional scenarios are based on existing Food and
  Agriculture Organization (FAO) definitions and definitions listed in the Glossary
  of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines. The other
  five scenarios were selected to represent a broad range of plausible combinations
  of definitions that could be applied under Article 3.3. All of these scenarios
  are listed in <a href="#table3-1">Table 3-1</a>.</p>

<p>The definitions of <i>ARD</i> and <i>forest</i> used to implement Article 3.3
  will affect the area of land covered by this Article. These definitions can
  also affect the area of land on which activities covered by Article 3.4 (see
  <a href="157.htm">Chapter 4</a>) could take place, assuming that no activity
  is to be counted under both Articles at the same time. For example, if the definition
  of reforestation does not include regeneration following clear-cut harvesting,
  ARD lands would be limited and more activities related to forest management
  could be considered under Article 3.4. The definitional scenarios illustrate
  how the harvest/regeneration cycle could be included or excluded from coverage
  under Article 3.3 through the use of different definitions of ARD and forest.
</p>
<p>This chapter examines the implications of the definitional scenarios and identifies
  the key decisions. Eight such decisions, the options for each, and the implications
  of each option are outlined in <a href="#table3-2">Table 3-2</a>. Although all
  combinations of options are possible, some combinations will create situations
  in which carbon stock changes reported under Article 3.3 will not reflect their
  actual contribution to the changes in the atmospheric concentration of carbon
  dioxide. </p>
