<h4>2.5.1.1. Potential Environmental Impacts of LULUCF Activities and Projects
</h4>
<p>This section discusses the potential associated impacts-positive and negative-of
  LULUCF activities and projects as they relate to several dimensions of environmental
  quality: biodiversity, soil quality, soil erosion, water quality and quantity,
  acidification, and climate feedbacks. </p>
<h5><a name="s2-5-1-1-1"></a>2.5.1.1.1. Biodiversity </h5>
<p>Biodiversity refers to the variability among living organisms and the ecological
  complexes of which they are part. Biodiversity includes diversity within species
  (genetic diversity), diversity between species, and diversity of ecosystems
  (Glowka <i>et al.</i>, 1994). The goal of biodiversity protection is not met
  by simply maintaining the number of species but by ensuring that no species,
  genes, or ecosystems-especially those that are endemic, rare, or threatened-are
  lost. Some of these benefits are most prominent in tropical and subtropical
  forests: Tropical forests harbor an estimated 50-70 percent of all species.
  Anticipated climate change will greatly change the environments for many species,
  with the likely result that many species with restricted distributions-especially
  slow-growing, late-successional species or those with restricted seed dispersal-may
  be lost (Kirschbaum <i>et al.</i>, 1996). </p>
<p>The diversity of life forms and their living environments generally decreases
  along the spectrum of land use from primary forest to regenerated forest, plantation
  forest, and agricultural land (e.g., Marshall and Swaine, 1992; Whitmore and
  Sayer, 1992; Michon and de Foresta, 1995; Canaday, 1996). Conversely, biodiversity
  increases when degraded lands are forested, and it is usually assumed that biodiversity
  increases when agricultural land is converted to most types of forest. </p>
<p>Agricultural lands can also be managed to be species-rich, however; in the
  tropics, biodiversity may sometimes be greater in a mixed landscape of primary
  forest, regenerated forest, plantations, and agricultural lands than in primary
  forest alone (Lawton <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Afforestation can increase diversity
  only where it replaces land cover that is species-poor; in some places, afforestation
  can threaten valuable non-forest species and habitats. </p>
<p>Biodiversity benefits to society derive from the fundamental contribution of
  biodiversity to ecosystem function, the provision of diverse goods and services,
  and aesthetic and spiritual factors. These benefits are enjoyed locally and
  globally and are experienced by individuals directly and indirectly. Clearly,
  not all of these biodiversity benefits can be well quantified or monetized.
  Even if these values could be derived in principle (and there is much debate
  among economists, ecologists, philosophers, and others about whether they can
  be), the methods for estimating them are limited, especially for the more intangible
  services that biodiversity provides (Norton, 1988; Stirling, 1993). Although
  various indirect methods have been developed to estimate biodiversity's value
  in monetary terms, no single method is capable of producing a valid monetary
  equivalent to each of the aspects of biodiversity value (Price, 1997). Although
  the monetary value of biodiversity is recognized as being very high (Pearce
  and Moran, 1994; Costanza <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Pimentel et al., 1997a), the
  willingness of the world at large to pay for it limits how much of this value
  can be translated into a monetary flow (Fearnside, 1999a). That willingness
  to pay generally has been increasing and may increase substantially in the future.
</p>
<p>Existence value-the intrinsic value of species and natural ecosystems to human
  society, independent of "utilitarian" benefits-is an area in which some progress
  has been made toward quantification for decisionmaking purposes (Attfield, 1998).
  This class of value accrues mostly to populations who are either very close
  to the forest-such as indigenous communities-or those who are far removed from
  it, such as urban dwellers elsewhere. </p>
<p>Estimating biodiversity benefits is more tractable when those benefits are
  tied to the provision of commercial goods and services, such as non-timber forest
  products (Peters <i>et al.</i>, 1989; Vásquez and Gentry, 1989; Whitehead and
  Godoy, 1991; Hecht, 1992; Richards, 1993; Grimes <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Pimentel
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997b). Local benefits also accrue from the stock of genetic
  material of plants and animals needed to produce a degree of adaptability to
  forest management and to agricultural systems that sacrifice biodiversity in
  nearby unprotected areas (Myers, 1989). The stock of useful chemical compounds
  and genetic materials for other than local use represents an investment in protecting
  future generations (including those in distant places) from the consequences
  of the absence of that material when it is needed one day. This factor is referred
  to as the "prospecting value" of genetic resources. A medicinal use, such as
  a cure for a disease, is worth more to society than the profits from selling
  the drug. This value also includes the value to consumers of the drug whose
  lives are saved or otherwise improved. </p>
<p>Several studies have shown substantial potential for identifying chemical models
  for pharmacological products based on tropical forest plants (Kaplan and Gottlieb,
  1990; Elisabetsky and Shanley, 1994; Cordell, 1995). An estimate of the opportunity
  cost for the sale of medicinal products derived from rainforests in Mexico arrived
  at a figure of US$6.4 ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, with a range from US$1-90 ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (Adger
  <i>et al.</i>, 1995). Simpson et al. (1996), however, estimate somewhat lower
  values for willingness to pay for the medicinal benefits of biodiversity. Their
  estimates range from $0.20-20.63 ha<sup>-1</sup> lump sum for incremental increases in
  land preserved in 18 biodiversity hot spots throughout the world. </p>
<p>Any major land-use change will change the types of habitats and species, irrespective
  of any change in diversity; the most serious negative impacts generally would
  result from deforestation of primary forest, especially in the tropics. Ongoing
  deforestation reduces the diversity of life forms by causing the extinction
  of organisms and the loss of genetic diversity in the remaining ones. Hence,
  with regard to biodiversity, the most beneficial outcomes generally can be achieved
  where deforestation can be halted or slowed. </p>
<p>Studies have systematically identified forest ecoregions throughout the world
  that are known to be both biologically important (containing an assemblage of
  species that is unusually rich, globally rare, or unique to that region) and
  under considerable threat of further loss or degradation (Dinerstein <i>et al.</i>,
  1995; Olson and Dinerstein, 1998). Any LULUCF climate mitigation project that
  slows deforestation or degradation will help conserve biodiversity. </p>
<p>Protecting the most threatened ecosystems does not always provide the greatest
  carbon benefits, however. In Brazil, for example, the least well-protected and
  most threatened types of forest are along the southern boundary of Amazonia,
  where reserve establishment is relatively expensive and forests contain less
  biomass than in central Amazonia (Fearnside and Ferraz, 1995). </p>
<p>On the other hand, tradeoffs between carbon storage and maintenance of biodiversity
  can also occur in the creation of large areas of productive managed forest,
  especially monocultures of exotic species. High productivity demands high light
  interception, which suppresses ground flora and limits other life forms (Hill
  and Wallace, 1989). Rapid forest establishment means that there are no long
  periods of recovery that provide habitats following natural disturbance (Rochelle
  and Bunnell, 1979). Harvesting at the time, which maximizes timber yield, prevents
  the development of special habitats that occur in old-growth forests (Bull and
  Meslow, 1977), and plantations of single tree species are likely to have more
  limited and particular types of fauna and flora than natural forest stands (Kennedy
  and Southwood, 1984). There are, however, management options to address the
  tradeoffs between production and biodiversity-such as adopting longer rotation
  times; altering felling unit sizes; altering edge lengths; prolonging rotation
  lengths; creating a multi-aged patchwork of stands; minimizing chemical inputs;
  reducing or eliminating measures to clear understory vegetation; or using mixed
  species plantings, including native species (e.g., Allen <i>et al.</i>, 1995a,b;
  Da Silva <i>et al.</i>, 1995). </p>
