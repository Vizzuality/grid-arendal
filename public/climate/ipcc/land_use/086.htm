<h3>2.4.3. Measurement of Flux </h3>
<p>A range of methods exists for measuring and estimating the flux of GHGs from
  the land's surface over different spatial scales. Some of these methods are
  discussed in the following sections. The development of methods is an active
  area of research. </p>
<p>Flux measurements are the only practical way of measuring non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> GHGs. Unlike
  carbon, methane and nitrous oxide do not exist as stocks on land, and changes
  in inventories cannot be used to infer fluxes to the atmosphere. These fluxes
  must be determined through direct measurement of changes in the concentration
  of the gas in chambers that enclose a piece of an ecosystem, through emissions
  ratios that relate the non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fluxes to CO<span class="subscript">2</span> flux, or with models that calculate
  net exchange from knowledge of soil properties. Estimates of flux for these
  gases are generally more uncertain than fluxes of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> because of their greater
  variability over time and space. </p>
<h4><a name="s2-4-3-1"></a>2.4.3.1. Local Scales (Less than 1 km<sup>2</sup>) </h4>
<p>Chambers may be used to enclose a small area, or an individual component, of
  an ecosystem (e.g., soils, stems, leaves). Changes in the concentration of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  (or other gases) within the chamber or differences between the concentrations
  in incoming and outgoing air are used to calculate flux. </p>
<p>Several techniques exist for measuring the flux of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> for an entire ecosystem
  (less than 1 km<sup>2</sup>) without enclosures. The technique in most common
  use today is the eddy correlation/ covariance technique (described below), which
  measures flux directly. Other techniques that are applicable at the same spatial
  scale infer a flux rather than measuring it directly. These techniques include
  the boundary layer gradient method (Griffith and Galle, 1999), tracer techniques
  (Leuning <i>et al.</i>, 1999), upwind-downwind measurements (Denmead <i>et al.</i>,
  1998), and long-path infrared spectroscopy. </p>
<p>The <i>eddy covariance </i>method is a well-developed method for measuring
  the exchange of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere-that is,
  Net Ecosystem Production (NEP) (e.g., Baldocchi <i>et al.</i>, 1988, 1996; Moncrieff
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Valentini <i>et al.</i>, 2000; Aubinet <i>et al.</i>, 2000).
  Measurements are continuous and semi-automatic (often with an hourly time step),
  and the net flux of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> entering or leaving the ecosystem integrates an area
  typically on the order of 20 ha. The precision integrated annually has a confidence
  interval of ±30 g C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> [0.3 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>]. A slight modification of the
  method, a relaxed eddy correlation technique, is applicable to non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> GHGs
  (Rinne <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>In some sites that are affected by complex topography, ecosystem nighttime
  respiration can be underestimated because of air advection (e.g., drainage flows),
  leading to an overestimation of the annual carbon balance (greater sink or smaller
  source of carbon). Methods have been developed to recognize when these cases
  occur, and corrections have been proposed (Aubinet <i>et al.</i>, 2000). </p>
<p>Automated eddy covariance measurements of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fluxes have now been made at
  more than 65 sites worldwide (FLUXNET16), with standard measurement protocols
  and storage systems. A typical cost for a complete eddy covariance system is
  on the order of US$50,000. The cost of site infrastructure is additional and
  will vary according to the remoteness of the site, the height of the vegetation
  (whether a tall tower must be built), and the existence of other facilities.
  The cost of a small mast over a pasture and an insulated container to house
  computers may be less than US$500; the typical cost of a 30-m walk-up scaffold
  tower for flux measurements is US$20,000. </p>
<p>The eddy covariance method determines overall net carbon exchanges at stand
  level. It is repeatable in time and is nondestructive. It can assist in the
  determination of carbon budgets of forests and other terrestrial vegetation
  on a project level, in the validation of forest growth models, and in verifying
  studies of carbon balances determined by stock change methods. </p>
<p>The rapidly expanding network of flux towers greatly assists in the understanding
  of land-atmosphere exchanges but does not yet provide reliable evidence of the
  magnitude and location of carbon sinks because a tower site does not operate
  over a large enough and sufficiently unbiased sample area to represent a land
  cover throughout its disturbance cycle. Furthermore, the method is limited to
  generally flat terrain with uniform vegetation. Nevertheless, the data confirm
  evidence for carbon sinks quantified by stock change measurements on a statistically
  representative sample. </p>
