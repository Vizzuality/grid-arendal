<h4>2.4.4.3. Determining the Extent, Rates, and Location of Other Activities </h4>
<p>Countries may determine that other activities will be allowed in addition to
  those that result in forest clearing and regrowth. Among the suite of activities
  currently under consideration in this Special Report, few appear to be suitable
  for the use of remotely sensed data. An exception might be wood harvest. Clear-cutting
  would most likely be observed, yet distinguishing between clear-cutting and
  clearing would be difficult. Satellite data have also been used to identify
  selective logging (Stone and Lefebvre, 1998; Souza and Barreto, 1999), although
  the techniques are more complex. In this regard, it may be important to recognize
  that satellite data are not routinely used in national forest inventories of
  most Annex I countries. Satellite data are not a substitute for <i>in situ</i>
  measurements; even changes in area are largely obtained though other methods.
  On the other hand, the use of satellite data in forest inventories is being
  explored (Kilpeläinen and Tokola, 1999). </p>
<p>Satellite data might also be important for activities other than ARD if it
  were decided that the locations of additional activities were to be required.
  In this case, high or very high spatial resolution remote-sensing data or the
  use of GPS information could be useful to document the locations of additional
  activities. </p>
<h4><a name="s2-4-4-4"></a>2.4.4.4. Determining the Extent and Degree of Natural
  Variability and Change </h4>
<p>For full carbon accounting or for estimation of baselines, determining the
  degree of natural variability in fluxes of carbon between terrestrial ecosystems
  and the atmosphere may be important. Remotely sensed data can contribute to
  this estimation in three ways: by providing maps of land cover through time
  (see <a href="090.htm#s2-4-4-1">Section 2.4.4.1</a>); by providing parameters
  for models that calculate net exchanges of gases between terrestrial ecosystems
  and the atmosphere; and by estimating the area affected by particularly large
  or frequent disturbances, especially fire and extensive pest outbreaks. </p>
<p>In the last 10 years, there has been tremendous progress in the scientific
  community's ability to simulate exchanges of carbon (and other material) between
  terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere (Schimel <i>et al.</i>, 1995). Many
  of these models use remotely sensed data to establish areas of land-cover types
  to which different attributes are assigned (e.g., production efficiency, surface
  roughness, albedo) or to determine parameters more directly (Sellers <i>et al.</i>,
  1997). All of these models are research tools at this time; they would require
  extensive validation and further development to be used in an operational context.
</p>
<p>Fires are one of the largest and most frequent perturbations of many ecosystems;
  they constitute a major source of GHGs and aerosols. Satellite data have been
  useful in measuring the occurrence of active fires and areas burned in the recent
  past (through fire scars observable from space). Daily fire monitoring can be
  provided with existing hot-spot detection algorithms working on thermal channel
  data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) AVHRR
  and European Space Agency (ESA) ATSR sensors. Fine-resolution mapping of selected
  burned areas can be accomplished with data from Landsat, SPOT, and IRS satellites.
  These satellites carry high-performance, well-calibrated sensors that include
  infrared, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared bands. </p>
<p>All of the satellite-based observational systems that are used to assess fire
  occurrence and burned area require <i>in situ </i>observations (or models) to
  assess fuel loads and thereby calculate GHG emissions. There currently is no
  direct way to measure GHG emissions from fire solely through the use of remotely
  sensed data. There also is no fully operational program for remote monitoring
  of fires, which would require observations throughout the day on a global basis,
  to characterize diurnal variability (Skole<i> et al.</i>, 1997). Nevertheless,
  several efforts are underway to develop operational protocols. </p>
