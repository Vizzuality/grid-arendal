<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>Methods are available for measuring carbon stocks and fluxes in all components
  of terrestrial ecosystems. These methods vary in accuracy, precision, cost,
  and scale of application. </p>
<p>Carbon accounting requires knowledge of the net change in carbon stocks over
  the land surface for the period 2008-2012. These changes can be measured with
  high precision (without distinguishing cause or attribution). The number of
  samples required might make such measurements expensive, but the methods exist.
  Most uncertain is the task of attributing measured changes in terrestrial carbon
  storage to direct human-induced activities. Experimental manipulation and paired
  plots can be used to distinguish direct human-induced effects on carbon stock
  changes, although these methods will be expensive to apply over large areas.
  Ecosystem models can also be used but need further improvement to decrease uncertainties.
</p>
<p>The technical capacity required by Annex 1 Parties to measure, monitor, and
  verify carbon stock changes under the Kyoto Protocol will be significantly affected
  by decisions of the Parties regarding the definitions of key terms. This capacity
  will also be affected by decisions on additional activities that may be included
  under Article 3.4, as well as whether additional activities are defined broadly
  or narrowly. </p>
<p>Methods for measuring changes in forest carbon stocks in aboveground biomass
  over a 5-year commitment period are sensitive enough to serve the requirements
  of the Protocol. Sensitive methods for measuring below-ground carbon stocks
  also exist, but changes in soil carbon stocks over the 5-year commitment period
  may be difficult to measure in some soils because they may be small compared
  to background levels, which may have high spatial variability. This problem
  can be addressed by taking a large number of samples within a single commitment
  period or by measuring and accounting over multiple commitment periods. Methods
  that further improve soil and vegetation carbon stock measurements will require
  research and development; these methods are likely to be highly transferable
  between Parties. </p>
<p>Direct flux measurements integrate changes over all carbon stocks, including
  below-ground carbon, for areas of about 100 ha. These measurements can assist
  in the determination of the carbon budgets of forests and other terrestrial
  vegetation at a project level, in the validation of forest growth models, and
  in verifying studies of carbon balances determined by stock-change methods.
</p>
<p>Regional and continental estimates of net carbon exchanges based on CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration
  measurements and modeling techniques (such as inverse analysis) are not yet
  suitable for use in implementing the Protocol. </p>
<p>The cost of conducting biospheric carbon inventories is only weakly dependent
  on the size of the area inventoried; it is more dependent on the range of ecological
  conditions within the area. This is because the spatial scale over which both
  soil and biomass carbon varies is quite small: a few tens to hundreds of meters.
  The sample size needed to achieve the desired precision is similar for a small
  country or a distinct region within a large country. Both require approximately
  the same analytical equipment and statistical treatment. Thus, for a given level
  of precision, the cost to a country will depend more on the range of different
  biogeophysical regions that exist within its borders than on the country's size.
</p>
<p>Independent methods also exist for the verification of measured changes in
  carbon stocks. For example, a range of existing flux measurement techniques
  may have application in verifying direct inventory measurements. Furthermore,
  methods applicable to the Kyoto Protocol are likely to improve and become less
  costly with time. </p>
