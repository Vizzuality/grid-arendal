<h4>3.3.2.5. Carbon Pools that Could be Considered and How They are Impacted by
  ARD Activities </h4>
<p><a href="053.htm">Section 2.2.5.3</a> discusses various carbon pools that could
  be included in carbon accounting for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol. This
  section discusses carbon pools from the specific perspective of ARD activities.
  These carbon pools are affected as follows (see <a href="#table3-6">Table 3-6</a>):
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <i>Living biomass.</i> Aboveground (stems, branches, leaves, flowers, and
    fruits) and below-ground (roots) living biomass will sequester carbon at a
    rate and to a total magnitude that depends on species, climate, and site quality.
    Even if forests are allowed to continue to grow, carbon stock in living biomass
    will eventually reach a maximum. It takes at least decades and more commonly
    centuries for forests to reach their maximum carbon storage potential. That
    carbon storage potential also depends on the level of forest management and
    natural disturbances. The living biomass carbon in areas where new forest
    is created will increase. If below-ground living biomass is not included in
    the accounting of deforestation, emissions to the atmosphere would be underreported.
    In afforestation or reforestation, sequestration rates would be underreported.</li>
  <li><i> Litter and debris.</i> Following creation of new forest, carbon in litter
    and woody debris (dead organic matter) increases over time. In deforestation,
    large amounts of debris are usually generated at the time of tree-felling.
    Amounts remaining on the ground may be low if logging debris is burned or
    removed from the site but can be substantial if debris is simply retained
    on site or if trees are not felled but simply killed by chemical injection.
    Amounts of litter and woody debris are usually higher in natural forest from
    which little or no timber has previously been harvested than in plantations
    (Ruhiyat, 1995). </li>
  <li><i> Soil.</i> On previously cultivated land where new forest is created,
    soil organic matter is expected to increase for decades to centuries (O'Connell
    and Sankaran, 1997). Soil organic matter will decrease rapidly following deforestation
    if land is subsequently cultivated. Changes in soil organic matter are likely
    to be small if the soil is not cultivated. </li>
  <li><i> Wood products/landfills.</i> Some ecosystem carbon removed during harvest
    or deforestation may be stored in forest products and landfills rather than
    immediately returning to the atmosphere. <br>
    If the harvest/regeneration cycle does not create ARD land, the proportion
    of the world wood supply derived from ARD land will be very small. In the
    FAO scenario, on the other hand, wood product stocks from ARD land could be
    quite significant, depending on whether the harvest that precedes reforestation
    is reported as a stock change. If wood products are included in carbon stock
    assessments, the initial loss of carbon following harvest on the stand level
    would be lower. The rate of increase in carbon stocks on ARD land also would
    not diminish as fast. The long-term effect would not be very different, however,
    from excluding wood products because only a portion of harvested wood usually
    is stored in long-lived timber products and because share also decays with
    time (Marland and Schlamadinger, 1999). <br>
    Whether any wood derived from ARD land results in a net increase in forest
    product and landfill carbon pools depends on future global harvest levels
    and the fate of the harvested material. In any case, it will be very difficult
    to track the fate of timber harvested from ARD land and distinguish it from
    all other harvested material. If (improved) wood product management is a separate
    activity under Article 3.4, wood products created under ARD lands would have
    to be excluded from Article 3.3 to avoid double-counting. If all wood products
    from a particular ARD land were to be assigned to that land and counted under
    Article 3.3, this accounting approach would be the "production approach" (IPCC,
    1999). As a consequence, these wood products would have to be excluded from
    the account of an importer of these products to avoid double-counting. If
    the importer were to count the carbon stock change from imported wood products,
    this would be the "stock change approach" (IPCC, 1999). The "atmospheric flow
    approach" in IPCC (1999) is not compatible with Article 3.3 because it does
    not provide a change in carbon stocks but gross flows of carbon to or from
    the atmosphere. </li>
