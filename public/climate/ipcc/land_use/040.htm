<h3>Carbon Accounting </h3>
<p>A well-designed carbon accounting system would provide consistent, transparent,
  and verifiable recording and reporting of changes in carbon stocks from applicable
  land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) activities and projects under
  Articles 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, and other relevant Articles to demonstrate compliance
  with the commitments defined by the Kyoto Protocol. </p>
<p>A "land-based" approach to accounting would take as its starting point the
  total carbon stock change in applicable carbon pools on land units subject to
  Kyoto accounting requirements. This approach involves first identifying land
  units on which applicable activities occur. Next, the total change in carbon
  stocks on these land units during the commitment period is determined. Adjustments
  can then be made to reflect decisions that the Parties may adopt regarding baselines,
  leakage, uncertainties, and timing. Aggregate emissions or removals are the
  sum of stock changes (net of adjustments) over all applicable land units. </p>
<p>An "activity-based" approach would start with the carbon stock change attributable
  to designated LULUCF activities. First, each applicable activity's impact on
  carbon stocks is determined per unit area. This impact is multiplied by the
  area on which each activity occurs. The carbon stock change would be less verifiable
  than it would be under a land-based approach. Adjustments may also be made to
  reflect policy decisions by the Parties. Aggregate emissions or removals are
  calculated by summing across applicable activities. A given area of land could
  be counted more than once if it is subject to multiple activities. This extra
  counting could result in inaccurate accounting if the effects of activities
  are not additive. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the Parties could decide that each land unit could contain no
  more than one activity. In this case, the combined impact of multiple practices
  applied in the same area would be considered a single activity. The activity-based
  accounting starts when the activity starts and ends when the activity ends.
  Stock changes prior to the start of the activity may or may not be accounted,
  even if they occur in a commitment period. Another option is to use a combination
  of land- and activity-based approaches, depending on the activity involved.
  For example, an activity that was reported using activity-based methods could
  be verified by land-based methods. </p>
<p>Only emissions and removals of carbon dioxide can be measured as changes in
  carbon stocks. Methane and nitrous oxide cannot be measured this way. Methane
  and nitrous oxide emissions from many land-use activities are included in Annex
  A of the Kyoto Protocol and the IPCC Guidelines; therefore, they will be captured
  in national inventories. However, emissions of these gases related to forestry
  activities, which are not included in Annex A, may not be captured. If these
  effects are not considered, the full impact of forestry activities may not be
  reflected in the Kyoto accounting system. Similarly, accurate assessment of
  the climate benefits of projects in non-Annex I countries would require accounting
  for changes in methane and nitrous oxide emissions. </p>
<p>Relevant carbon pools are pools that are affected by activities and projects.
  Relevant pools include aboveground biomass, litter and woody debris, below-ground
  biomass, soil carbon, and harvested materials. The degree of impact may vary
  significantly between activities and types of projects, however. Although methods
  exist to measure all carbon pools, monitoring is far from routine and costs
  vary significantly. To reduce monitoring costs, the Parties may decide that
  selective accounting of carbon pools, consistent with the objectives of the
  UNFCCC, could be used by including all pools that are expected to have reduced
  carbon stocks while neglecting selected pools that are expected, with a sufficient
  level of certainty, to have increased carbon stocks. The verifiability requirements
  in the Protocol mean that only carbon pools that can be measured and monitored
  could be claimed as a credit. </p>
<p>Changes in carbon stocks in the wood products pool could be accounted as part
  of the activity that is the source of the wood products or as an independent
  wood products management activity. If management of wood products is treated
  as an additional activity under Article 3.4, it may be necessary to exclude
  wood products from accounting in other Article 3.3 or 3.4 activities to avoid
  double-counting. Once products are in trade, their source will seldom be traceable.
  If changes in wood product pools are not accounted and it is assumed that the
  carbon is lost immediately, the system will not account for a potentially important
  pool. </p>
<p>Measurement uncertainty could be addressed by adjusting estimated stock changes.
  A precautionary approach would adjust the estimate in the direction that is
  likely to understate increases and overstate decreases in stocks. This approach
  would allow individual Parties to make tradeoffs between increased monitoring
  costs and the potential to increase carbon credits or reduce debits. If "good
  practice" methodologies for measuring the impact of LULUCF activities are developed
  and adopted, it could be decided that estimates made in conformity with this
  methodology would not be subject to an uncertainty adjustment. </p>
<p>Enhancement of carbon stocks resulting from LULUCF activities is potentially
  reversible through human activities, disturbances, or environmental change.
  This reversibility can be accounted for by ensuring that any credit for enhanced
  carbon stocks would have to be balanced by accounting for subsequent reductions
  in those carbon stocks, regardless of the cause. </p>
<p>Contiguous commitment periods would avoid incentives to concentrate activities
  that reduce carbon stocks in time periods that were not covered. </p>
<p>Policies by governments or other institutions (e.g., land tenure reform, tax
  incentives, timber and agricultural subsidies) provide conditions and incentives
  for the implementation of LULUCF activities. The ability to measure the impact
  of these conditions and incentives will depend, in part, on the carbon inventory
  and monitoring system in each country. It may be very difficult, however, for
  countries to assess the relative contribution of such policies or institutions
  compared to other human and natural factors that drive changes in carbon stocks.
</p>
<p> Natural variability and the indirect effects of human activity-such as carbon
  dioxide fertilization, nutrient deposition, or climate-induced changes in disturbance
  regimes-could significantly affect carbon stocks during a commitment period.
  If credits and debits were available for natural variability and indirect effects,
  the accounting implications for the Kyoto Protocol could be significant. The
  Kyoto Protocol specifies that accounting under Article 3.3 be restricted to
  certain "direct human-induced" activities occurring since 1990. Therefore, the
  Parties may wish to consider whether to count the full carbon stock change on
  lands under Article 3.3 or only the part of the stock change that can be attributed
  to direct human-induced activity. For activities that involve land-use changes
  (e.g., from grassland to forest), distinguishing with present scientific tools
  the portion of the observed stock change that is directly human induced from
  the portion that is caused by indirect and natural factors is very difficult,
  if not impossible. </p>
<p>For activities for which only management changes (e.g., conservation tillage)
  are involved and land use remains the same, it may be feasible to largely "factor
  out" natural variability and indirect effects. One approach may be to subtract
  the stock changes on control (comparison) plots where there have been no changes
  in management practice from changes measured on plots with modified management
  activities. In most cases, experimental manipulation or paired plots can be
  used for this purpose, although they are likely to be expensive to apply over
  large areas. Ecosystem models can also be used but may need further improvement
  to decrease uncertainties. </p>
<p>In national accounting, there are many options for baselines that could be
  applied under Article 3.4. These potential baselines include the stock change
  that would have resulted from "business-as-usual" activities; the stock change
  that would have resulted from the continuation of 1990 activity levels; the
  stock change that would result in the absence of active management; performance
  benchmarks or standard management practice; and the rate of change of stocks
  in 1990. One difficulty with the use of counterfactual baselines is verification.
</p>
<p>Another option for implementing Article 3.4 is a project-based approach that
  uses a baseline to limit credits to carbon benefits that are "additional" to
  what would have otherwise occurred. Article 3.4 refers to additional activities
  that are not project-based activities; unlike in Articles 6 and 12, there may
  be no requirement that these activities are "additional" to what would have
  occurred against a business-as-usual baseline. The use of a project-based approach
  to Article 3.4, as opposed to a national approach, would increase the potential
  for leakage of project benefits. </p>
<p>If different accounting rules are adopted for Article 3.1, 3.3, or 3.4 activities,
  additional decision rules may be needed to determine which accounting rule applies
  to land that over time is subject to multiple types of activities. For example,
  one set of accounting rules could be given primacy in cases in which more than
  one set of rules could apply and double-counting might result. </p>
<p>The spatial resolution of samples taken in monitoring has important implications.
  If the size of sampled land areas is small, monitoring becomes very demanding
  and costly. Hence, there are clear tradeoffs between an accurate assessment
  of changes in carbon stocks and cost. If the sampling resolution is set at a
  coarse scale, data demands can be modest, but significant areas subject to an
  activity may be lost in the averaging process. For example, if canopy cover
  is assessed over land areas of 100 ha, deforestation of smaller areas (i.e.,
  several hectares) within a unit will not take the canopy cover of the unit below
  the forest definition threshold, and changes in carbon stocks will not be counted.
  Likewise, afforestation or reforestation of smaller areas will not be counted.
</p>
<p>Leakage is the failure to capture greenhouse gas (GHG) changes outside the
  accounting system that result from GHG changes within the system. For instance,
  forest protection measures may be used to sequester or reduce the emission of
  carbon from lands within the accounting system. Market forces may simply shift
  the extractive activity elsewhere, however. If emissions from the diverted activity
  fall outside the accounting system, system measures will fail to give an accurate
  assessment of the true aggregate changes. As the spatial and temporal scale
  of accounting increases, leakage errors generally become less significant (i.e.,
  there is less activity that falls outside the system). Leakage is of particular
  concern in project-level accounting, but it can also occur with activities under
  Articles 3.3 and 3.4. Leakage (from Annex I to non-Annex I) could also be an
  issue in other sectors, but it is not assessed in this report. </p>
