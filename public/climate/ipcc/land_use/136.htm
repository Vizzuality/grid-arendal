<h4>3.3.2.10 Relation of ARD Activities to Activities under Article 3.4 and Projects
  under Article 6</h4>
<p>Article 3.3 states that stock changes from ARD activities shall be used to
  meet commitments. If the COP accepts further activities under Article 3.4, how
  should these activities be treated if they occur on the same land for which
  stock changes are already counted under Article 3.3? There are three options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The land is no longer considered under Article 3.3 but included exclusively
    under Article 3.4: This option might violate Article 3.3, which stipulates
    that all stock changes resulting from ARD activities "shall" be reported.
    There is a possibility, however, that reporting stock changes from ARD activities
    under Article 3.4 would be regarded as sufficient to satisfy the "shall" requirement
    of Article 3.3.</li>
  <li>The land is considered under Article 3.3, and stock changes from the Article
    3.4 activity are counted under Article 3.3 as well: This option would avoid
    the risk of possible double-counting. It eliminates the need to determine
    whether an Article 3.4 activity has occurred on ARD land.</li>
  <li>Stock changes from an ARD activity are counted under Article 3.3, and stock
    changes on the same piece of land from an Article 3.4 activity are counted
    under Article 3.4: This option poses a danger of double-counting, and separation
    of stock changes according to cause will be difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, there might be lands that are already under the realm of Article
  3.4 on which a subsequent ARD activity takes place. There are three options
  in this case as well: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The land is no longer considered under Article 3.4 but counted under Article
    3.3. </li>
  <li> The land continues to be considered under Article 3.4, so stock changes
    from the ARD activity are accounted under Article 3.4: This option would exclude
    some ARD activities from being counted under Article 3.3, however-which would
    be inconsistent with the wording of Article 3.3. </li>
  <li>Stock changes from an Article 3.4 activity are counted under Article 3.4,
    and stock changes on the same piece of land from an ARD activity are counted
    under Article 3.3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another issue involves how ARD activities relate to projects undertaken under
  Article 6. This issue is discussed separately for land-based and activity-based
  approaches: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Land-based approach.</i> All stock changes on a unit of land are accounted
    once the land undergoes an ARD activity. If the same activity also falls under
    Article 6, then-according to Articles 3.10 and 3.11-only the "additional"
    carbon credits [Article 6.1(b)] can be transferred to another country. In
    other words, assigned amounts are deducted from the host country's budget
    and added to the investor country's budget. For example, if the stock change
    from an ARD activity is 2 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, but only 1.5 t C of that amount are
    "additional" (the rest coming from a longer term increase in soil carbon),
    the 2 t C are added to the host country's assigned amount via Article 3.3,
    and 1.5 t C are deducted via Article 3.11. The net gain for the host country,
    after the transaction, would be 0.5 t C.</li>
  <li><i>Activity-based approach.</i> The stock changes that result from the ARD
    activity are accounted under Article 3.3. This approach seems compatible with
    the additionality requirement under Article 6. In the foregoing example, the
    credit under Article 3.3 would be 1.5 t C, all of which would be transferred
    via Article 3.11</li>
</ul>
