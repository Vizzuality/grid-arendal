<h4>5.4.1.2. Measurement of Carbon Benefits </h4>
<p>Land-use and forestry projects generally are easier to quantify and monitor
  than national inventories because of the clearly defined boundaries for project
  activities, the relative ease of stratification of the project area, and the
  choice of carbon pools to measure (<a href="271.htm">Section 5.4.1.1</a>). Techniques
  and methods for sampling design and for accurately and precisely measuring individual
  carbon pools in LULUCF projects are based on commonly accepted principles of
  forest inventory, soil sampling, and ecological surveys (Pinard and Putz, 1996,
  1997; MacDicken, 1997a,b; Post <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Winrock International, 1999;
  Hamburg, 2000). For example, there is a wealth of experience with well-developed
  and accepted methods to inventory forests for merchantable volume and growth;
  these methods can be and are being readily adopted to inventory forest biomass
  carbon. Likewise with regard to measuring soil carbon, standardized techniques
  are well established. Further descriptions of methods for estimating the carbon
  pool in live tree biomass, understory and herbaceous plants, roots, fine and
  coarse litter, and soil are described in <a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a>. Standard
  methods have not been universally applied to all projects, however, and methods
  of accounting for carbon benefits have not been standardized-resulting in some
  difficulties in comparing results across different LULUCF projects. </p>
<p>For most LULUCF projects, it would be necessary to measure non-project reference
  or control sites as well. These sites must be sufficiently similar to the project
  area to serve as valid proxies under the assumption that the project was not
  implemented (Vine <i>et al.</i>, 1999). To help overcome the difficulty of establishing
  proxy areas, non-project reference sites could be identified during the project
  design phase. The location of proxy sites as close as possible to the project
  would be the most desirable situation. For example, in projects in which many
  small landowners convert to no-till agriculture, proxy areas would be farmers
  in the area who do not practice no-till agriculture. <a href="264.htm#box5-3">Box
  5-3</a> illustrates the types of measurements being taken to estimate with-
  and without-project cases and the resulting carbon benefits. </p>
<p>The total carbon stock has been measured to <10 percent of the mean with 95-percent
  confidence in several pilot LULUCF projects (e.g., Programme for Belize, 1997a;
  Hamburg, 2000; NKCAP-see <a href="264.htm#box5-3">Box 5-3</a>). Although techniques
  and tools exist to measure carbon stocks in project areas to a high degree of
  precision, the same level of precision for carbon benefits may not be achieved.
  The carbon benefit per unit area of land is the difference between the carbon
  stocks in the with-project case-which is high if, for example, the project is
  conserving carbon in existing forests through an avoided deforestation project-and
  the carbon pools in the without-project case, which is low if the baseline is
  agricultural or degraded lands. In this case, the estimated carbon benefit is
  likely to be high (a small carbon stock subtracted from a large carbon stock),
  and the error estimate, expressed as a percentage of the mean difference, likely
  to be small and similar to that obtained for carbon stocks in the forests. As
  the difference between the with- and without-project cases decreases as, for
  example, in reduced impact logging projects, however, the percentage error of
  the carbon benefit increases. To reduce this error, monitoring can be designed
  to measure the change in carbon stocks directly, as in the NKCAP (see <a href="264.htm#box5-3">Box
  5-3</a>). Difficulties in establishing baselines and leakage effects also affect
  the precision of the carbon benefits. </p>
