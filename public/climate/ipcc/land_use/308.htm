<h4>6.3.2.2. Specific Issues on Additional Activities </h4>
<p>Some of the specific practices within the activities are explicitly included
  in the Workbook, some could be included with minor modification (see <a href="307.htm#s6-3-2-1">Section
  6.3.2.1</a>), and some could be included only with extensive revision. For example,
  in the cropland management activity, tillage practices are explicitly included,
  whereas erosion reduction practices are not currently dealt with. The Fact Sheets
  in Appendix A of <a href="157.htm">Chapter 4</a> provide a brief assessment of the extent to which
  the Guidelines can be used to account for the individual activities. </p>
<p><a href="157.htm">Chapter 4</a> also identifies the potential carbon net storage
  of improved management within a land use, land-use change, and off-site carbon
  storage. Activities with the greatest potential change in the aboveground and
  below-ground biomass are discussed below. </p>
<p><i>Cropland management.</i> The following practices are aimed at increasing
  soil carbon or reducing losses of soil carbon: cropland management on non-flooded
  soils, conservation tillage, increased crop productivity (i.e., carbon inputs),
  control of soil water, and erosion reduction. This last activity is a source,
  so the issues raised above about changes in stocks in 1990 are relevant. The
  default assumptions in the Guidelines can be adjusted to account for changes
  in cropland management. For intensive agriculture, these assumptions would be
  the input factors for carbon inputs. For conservation tillage, the appropriate
  factors are the tillage assumptions. There are no specific factors to deal with
  soil erosion or irrigation, except through the use of input factors because
  these values determine the carbon residues. </p>
<p><i>Grazing lands management.</i> Increases of stocks of aboveground and below-ground
  carbon could be accounted for in a manner analogous to that for ARD. Activities
  that enhance uptake by sinks include those that increase tree numbers; activities
  that reduce emissions from sources are those that reduce the intensity of grazing.
  Non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions would be reported under the agriculture sector. Because of
  the extensive nature of grasslands, the costs of measurement and verification
  may need to be considered. Changes in fire management would require classification
  of "management" because experience has shown that the current guidelines are
  ambiguous. Although the Guidelines do not specify grazing lands, again the input
  factors could be adjusted to reflect changes in this management practice. Any
  grazing land under set-aside management would result in uptake of aboveground
  biomass, which could be accounted for under the "abandonment of managed lands"
  section in the Guidelines. </p>
<p><i>Forest management.</i> The build-up of carbon in protected areas could be
  accounted for if a definition of human-induced activity were to include the
  act of protection. Agroforestry and forest management (fertilization, thinning,
  etc.) could be reported in a manner analogous to ARD. The Guidelines can be
  used for estimating changes in aboveground biomass. As above, changes in carbon
  stock resulting from changes in forest management could be accounted for under
  the calculation in the Guidelines for soil carbon and aboveground biomass. Specific
  data for the assumptions-such as input and tillage factors-would have to be
  generated, however, as would assumptions for aboveground biomass. </p>
<p><i>Wood products.</i> If an activity that brings about changes in wood products
  is included under Article 3.4, the approach in the Guidelines would not be adequate
  to estimate such changes. </p>
