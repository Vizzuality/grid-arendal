<h5>2.4.2.3.6. Analytical methods </h5>
<p>Accurate laboratory assessments of soil carbon content require the use of carbon
  (combustion) analyzers. Analytical methods based on mass loss on ignition or
  wet digestion (see Nelson and Sommers, 1982; Tiessen and Moir, 1993) are prone
  to biases. Although these biases can be calibrated (Kalembasa and Jenkinson,
  1973), they add another level of uncertainty to the estimate. Methods for sample
  preparation and analysis for SOC and SIC are well documented elsewhere (Lal
  <i>et al.</i>, 2000). The carbon stock per unit area of land can be calculated
  from the percentage of carbon and the soil bulk density. For transparency and
  verifiability purposes, soil samples can be geo-referenced and archived in a
  dried state in a dark, cool place for future carbon analysis, and original data
  can be retained. Some archived samples should be re-analyzed at the same time
  as repeat samples to confirm that there has been no drift in analytical precision.
  Methods also exist to measure different components of SOC (see <a href="161.htm">Section
  4.2</a>). </p>
<p>Modern dry combustion procedures have an analytical precision of ±2-3 percent.
  The error associated with assessments at the regional and global scales also
  depends on errors introduced through spatial variability and sampling error
  and therefore will be much higher than 3 percent. Establishing quality protocols
  for all methods is important. The cost of analysis varies from region to region,
  by number of samples, and by efficiency. On a global scale, the per-sample cost
  of carbon analysis may range from US$3 (where labor costs are very low) to about
  US$20, with significant proportions of the total cost accounted for by sampling
  (high labor cost), sample preparation, bulk density measurement, inorganic carbon
  analysis (or pre-acidification of samples to remove carbonate), archival of
  samples, and quality control efforts. This cost range is broadly consistent
  with that reported for a Canadian study by Izaurralde <i>et al.</i> (1997).
</p>
<p>Special consideration is necessary for peatlands and other wetland soils-collectively
  known as Histosols-in which the layer of undecomposed organic matter may be
  several meters in depth. These soils are vulnerable to large losses of organic
  matter upon changes in regional drainage or soil temperature. Particularly in
  areas that have been drained, accurate measurement of changes in carbon stock
  in peat soils requires reliable measurement of carbon loss through decay of
  organic material. Accurate measurement of changes in carbon in peat soils probably
  requires fixed reference points for measuring subsidence from decay. When subsidence
  is being measured, corrections should be made for depth changes resulting from
  changes in soil moisture content. Estimates of changes in the storage of carbon
  in peatlands must avoid biases that may result from changes in bulk density
  because of compaction of surface layers. Often, the age of peat at a given depth
  may be determined by <sup>14</sup>C or <sup>210</sup>Pb dating, allowing workers to assess additions
  or losses of organic carbon above a depth of known age. </p>
