<h3>3.4.4. Uncertainty of Afforestation, Reforestation, and Deforestation Activities
</h3>
<p>The first determination needed for Article 3.3-identification of ARD land-requires
  classification of land as forest or non-forest for at least two points in time
  or an activity reporting mechanism to identify lands that have been subject
  to ARD activities. Regardless of the method chosen to identify where ARD activities
  have occurred, some uncertainty is expected to occur. The uncertainty involved
  in activity reporting is primarily caused by reporting errors or biases (underreporting
  or overreporting). In the land-use/land-cover classification case, for example,
  a remote-sensing identification of forest/non-forest areas may include some
  inaccuracy in classification, which is also a function of the type of orbital
  system used. Mantovani and Setzer (1997) compared the number of deforestation
  polygons using the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor (1.1-km
  resolution) with the number from the yearly deforestation project conducted
  by Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) using the Thematic Mapper
  (TM) sensor (30-m resolution). The comparative results indicated that only 49-57
  percent of the total cases were correctly identified with the low-resolution
  sensor. This difference in ability to detect deforestation appears to be related
  to the size of the sites considered. As observed in the TM images, deforestation
  polygons less than 3.1 km<sup>2</sup> in size were usually not detected in the AVHRR imagery.
</p>
<p>In addition, depending on the season in which the imagery is taken, forested
  areas can be confused with other vegetated areas in classifications. Areas in
  which forest cover may be sparse or very young may meet certain definitions
  of forest yet may appear in the image to be in a non-forest condition. Here,
  using definitions of forest that are based on low canopy cover thresholds or
  that provide for classification of early growth stages likely will result in
  more misclassifications (of forest as non-forest) than definitions that require
  high percentage cover. Ground-based inventories are more accurate in this respect
  than inventories that are based on remotely sensed data. </p>
<p>Different definitions for forest, afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation
  will lead to different levels of difficulty of data collection and different
  levels of uncertainty. Definitions that are based on objective and readily measurable
  variables will tend to yield lower uncertainties. For example, a forest definition
  that is based completely on the proportion of land covered by woody species
  (e.g., Land Cover scenario) will lead to more accurate estimates than a definition
  that involves purpose or history of land use or functional mechanisms used for
  establishing forests (e.g., Land Use scenario). </p>
<p>The uncertainty of stock change estimates will also vary with the magnitude
  of the stock in terms of spatial extent and density. Detecting large relative
  changes in a small stock is easier than detecting small relative changes in
  a large stock. This fact implies that countries with higher carbon density in
  forests will have a greater uncertainty for a given magnitude of stock change
  than countries with lower forest carbon density. Furthermore, changing the threshold
  of forest cover in a definition may influence the uncertainty in detecting ARD
  activities. </p>
<p>Because ARD activities are change processes, definitions and methods have to
  be consistent on successive occasions. In the framework of the Kyoto Protocol,
  it is convenient to group the scenarios presented in <a href="123.htm">Section
  3.2</a> in two broad classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Scenarios for which country statistics and map systems with appropriate
    models exist</li>
  <li>Scenarios that require a new set of data (inventories, maps, results from
    models) following a common, consistent approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a new data collection system has to be implemented, obtaining the necessary
  retrospective information will be difficult regardless of the scenario applied
  because, at a minimum, data are required on the status of lands in 1990. Use
  of archived remotely sensed data, inventory plots that may have been established
  for another purpose, and/or retrospective models may be the only available alternatives.
  Evaluating the uncertainty or verifying such estimates would be impossible.
</p>
<p>Uncertainties in determining stock changes from ARD activities will be sensitive
  to various components of the data collection process. A crucial component is
  the sampling scheme used for detection of ARD activities, which will determine
  the minimum detectable change in forest condition. Difficulties arise if the
  sampling resolution is inconsistent with the assessment unit sizes in the definition
  adopted for forest. If a ground-based forest inventory is used to sample ARD
  activities, the sampling intensity-expressed as hectares of land represented
  by each plot-will give an indication of the ability of the system to detect
  ARD activities on small land areas. For assessments that are based on remotely
  sensed data, the spatial resolution of the sensor used will be crucial in determining
  the minimum detectable change. </p>
<p>Consistency in sampling schemes between assessments is also important: Erroneous
  conclusions can be reached if sampling intensity (or sensor resolution) changes
  substantially between assessments. For example, suppose that 1-km resolution
  data were used for a first assessment, and a 1-km<sup>2</sup> area was identified as forest.
  At a second assessment, 100-m resolution data might detect non-forest areas
  within the original 1-km<sup>2</sup> area, leading to an interpretation of deforestation.
  That 100-m opening may have existed within the 1-km<sup>2</sup> area during the first assessment,
  however, in which case the determination of deforestation would be in error.
</p>
<p>Timing of measurements will also affect the ability to detect stock changes
  from ARD activities. Forest inventories can be time-consuming, multi-year processes,
  particularly in large areas. In the United States and many European countries,
  for instance, the national forest inventory cycle is about 10 years. With this
  type of measurement timing, it is impractical to expect accurate, verifiable
  estimates of stock changes during a 5-year commitment period and for a small
  but comprehensive subset of the inventory area. Some nations are beginning to
  use annual inventory systems, but the transition from periodic national inventories
  to annual inventories is costly and difficult. In some cases, new sampling protocols
  (timing and intensity of samples) may need to be adopted if national inventory
  data are to be useful for the carbon accounting required under Article 3.3.
</p>
<p>Although the focus here has been on implications for the first commitment period,
  there are considerations for subsequent commitment periods. Errors in classification
  of forest/non-forest can have effects in subsequent commitment periods, either
  in the determination of areas requiring stock estimates for Article 3.3 or in
  assessments of stock changes between the first commitment period and later commitment
  periods. For example, consider a parcel that was forested in 1990 and was subsequently
  misclassified as non-forest after 1990. This misclassification could lead to
  an erroneous classification of deforestation and carbon debits for the assessment
  of the first commitment period. The error depends on the definitions applied
  and the method used to determine carbon stock changes. If the method involves
  some form of carbon stock measurement, the misclassification of ARD land will
  have no impact on the reported carbon stock change because there will be none
  in the misclassified area. A subsequent (correct) classification of the same
  area as forested would produce a second faulty determination-this time of reforestation
  and creditable carbon stock increase. Similarly, errors in estimates of stock
  changes can have persistent effects after the first commitment period. No matter
  what sampling scheme is employed, these types of errors will occur. The key
  issue is the identification of systematic problems that will generate biased
  estimates of ARD activities and random errors that offset one another, having
  little effect on ARD activities determinations. </p>
