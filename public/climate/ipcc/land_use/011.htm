<h4>8. Reporting Guidelines for the Relevant Articles of the Kyoto Protocol </h4>
<ol start="83">
  <li>Under Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol, the Revised 1996 Guidelines for
    National Greenhouse Gas Inventories provide the basis for the accounting and
    reporting of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all
    greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. These Guidelines
    were developed to estimate and report national greenhouse gas inventories
    under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),
    not for the particular needs of the Kyoto Protocol. However, the Guidelines
    do provide a framework for addressing the accounting and reporting needs of
    the Kyoto Protocol. Elaboration of the Land-Use Change and Forestry Sector
    of the Guidelines may be needed, reflecting possible decisions by the Parties
    for accounting and reporting LULUCF under the Kyoto Protocol, taking into
    account, inter alia:
    <ul>
      <li>Any decisions made by Parties on ARD under Article 3.3 and on additional
	activities under Article 3.4. [<a href="305.htm#s6-3-1">6.3.1</a>, <a href="307.htm">6.3.2</a>]
      </li>
      <li> The need to ensure transparency, completeness, consistency, comparability,
	accuracy, and verifiability. [<a href="301.htm">6.2.2</a>, <a href="302.htm">6.2.3</a>,
	<a href="311.htm">6.4.1</a>] </li>
      <li> Consistent treatment of Land-Use Change and Forestry as other Sectors,
	with respect to uncertainty management and other aspects of good practice.
	[<a href="311.htm">6.4.1</a>] </li>
      <li> Any decisions adopted by Parties to address other accounting issues
	(e.g., permanence, the meaning of "human induced" and "direct human induced,"
	wood products, and project based activities). [<a href="311.htm">6.4.1</a>]
      </li>
    </ul>

<h4><a name="s9"></a>9. Potential for Sustainable Development </h4>
<ol start="84">
  <li>Consideration would need to be given to synergies and tradeoffs related
    to LULUCF activities under the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol in the context
    of sustainable development including a broad range of environmental, social,
    and economic impacts, such as: (i) biodiversity; (ii) the quantity and quality
    of forests, grazing lands, soils, fisheries, and water resources; (iii) the
    ability to provide food, fiber, fuel, and shelter; and (iv) employment, human
    health, poverty, and equity. [<a href="096.htm">2.5.1</a>, <a href="153.htm">3.6</a>]
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>For example, converting non-forest land to forest will typically increase
    the diversity of flora and fauna, except in situations where biologically
    diverse non-forest ecosystems, such as native grasslands, are replaced by
    forests consisting of single or a few species. Afforestation can also have
    highly varied impacts on groundwater supplies, river flows, and water quality.
    [<a href="154.htm">3.6.1</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A system of criteria and indicators could be used to assess and compare
    sustainable development impacts across LULUCF alternatives. While there are
    no agreed upon set of criteria and indicators, several sets are being developed
    for closely related purposes, for example assessment of contributions to sustainable
    development by the UN Commission on Sustainable Development. [<a href="104.htm">2.5.2</a>]
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>For activities within countries or projects between countries, if sustainable
    development criteria vary significantly across countries or regions, there
    may be incentives to locate activities and projects in areas with less stringent
    environmental or socioeconomic criteria. [<a href="104.htm">2.5.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Several sustainable development principles are incorporated in other multilateral
    environmental agreements, including the UN Convention on Biological Diversity,
    the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, and the Ramsar Convention on
    Wetlands. Consideration may be given to the development of synergies between
    LULUCF activities and projects that contribute to the mitigation or adaptation
    to climate change with the goals and the objectives of these and other relevant
    multilateral environmental agreements. [<a href="104.htm">2.5.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Some of the more formal approaches to sustainable development assessment
    that could be applied at the project level are, for example, environmental
    and socioeconomic impact assessments. These methods have been applied across
    a wide range of countries and site-specific activities to date and could be
    modified to be applicable to LULUCF projects. [<a href="106.htm">2.5.2.2</a>]
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Some critical factors affecting the sustainable development contributions
    of LULUCF activities and projects to mitigate and adapt to climate change
    include: institutional and technical capacity to develop and implement guidelines
    and procedures; extent and effectiveness of local community participation
    in development, implementation, and distribution of benefits; and transfer
    and adoption of technology. [<a href="283.htm">5.5</a>, <a href="286.htm">5.6</a>]
