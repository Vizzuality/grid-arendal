<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.15. Pest Management </h3>
<p>Pest management is the application of approved strategies to maintain a pest's
  population within tolerable levels. Improved pest management may prevent damage
  and tree mortality in forests and thus increase carbon stocks. Processes related
  to tree health are well known, whereas the reasons pests occur and how they
  can be prevented are less well known. Interactions between climate change, pest
  populations, and wildfire (see <a href="237.htm">Fact Sheet 4.14</a>) are likely
  to become more important in affecting forest carbon stocks in managed and unmanaged
  forests in the next century. </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  Nabuurs <i>et al.</i> (1999) (based on Kurz <i>et al.</i>, 1992; Townsend <i>et
  al.</i>, 1996; Gillies and Leckie, 1996) estimate the area affected by insect
  attacks in Canada to be roughly equivalent to the area burned. They assume that
  reducing the area affected by insect attacks by 50 percent would save the same
  amount of carbon as fire protection (about 2.3 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>). These phenomena are
  not disconnected, however. Large insect epidemics can create areas of dead and
  dying trees that provide a fuel source for very large wildfires in the right
  ignition and weather conditions. As a result, pest management may be one important
  parameter of fire management and long-term forest ecosystem health. </p>
<p><b>Methods and Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  This activity is very uncertain. Even in areas where access is possible, effective
  methods of predicting and preventing pest outbreaks may be lacking. In remote
  areas, mitigation or treatment may be impractical or impossible. Few empirical
  studies exist to help managers affect why and how pest populations move from
  endemic to epidemic. </p>
<p><b>Time Scale, Monitoring, Variability, and Transparency </b><br>
  There seem to be few practical ways in which this activity, by itself, could
  be linked directly to changes in carbon stocks. As part of a broad forest management
  activity, it could contribute to measured changes in carbon stocks achieved
  by land-based methods. Separating the carbon impacts of this single activity
  would seem to be difficult or impossible. </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  Where biocides are used to control pests, this activity may result in reduced
  biodiversity and lower landscape/recreational benefits. On the other hand, where
  it prevents large-scale forest die-off, it may dramatically increase landscape,
  recreational, watershed, and other benefits. High costs and uncertainty about
  the effectiveness of various mitigation measures are among the reasons that
  this activity is limited in many areas. </p>
