<h4>1. Introduction</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Under Article 3.1 of the Kyoto Protocol, the Annex I Parties have agreed
    to limit and reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases between 2008 and 2012.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The Kyoto Protocol makes provision for Annex I Parties to take into account
    afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation and other agreed land use,
    land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) activities in meeting their commitments
    under Article 3.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>To implement the Kyoto Protocol, issues related to LULUCF will have to be
    considered. Relevant issues may include for example: <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Definitions, including land-use change, forests, forestry activities,
      including afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation, carbon stocks,
      human-induced, and direct human-induced.</li>
    <li>Methodological issues, such as:
      <ul>
	<li>Rules for accounting for carbon stock changes and for emissions and
	  removals of greenhouse gases from LULUCF activities, including:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Which carbon pools to include. </li>
	    <li>How to implement "since 1990," "direct human-induced," and "human-induced."
	    </li>
	    <li>How to address the risks and effects of events such as fires,
	      pest outbreaks, and extreme meteorological events; baselines; permanence;
	      interannual and decadal climate variability; and leakage. </li>
	    <li>Accuracy, precision, and uncertainties in tracking carbon stocks
	      and greenhouse gases.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Approaches, such as geo-referencing and statistical sampling, associated
	  with identifying lands with activities defined under Article 3.3, accepted
	  under Article 3.4, or associated with project-based activities under
	  the Kyoto Protocol, and measuring and estimating changes in carbon stocks
	  and greenhouse gases. </li>
	<li>Verification procedures.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Determination of how and which additional activities pursuant to Article
      3.4 are included. </li>
    <li>How to link the first and subsequent commitment periods. </li>
    <li>Determination of how and which project-based activities are included.
    </li>
    <li>What improvements, if any, are needed to the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines
      for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the Good Practice Guidance and
      Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. </li>
    <li>What are the implications of and what, if any, national and/or international
      sustainable development criteria could be associated with Articles 3.3 and
      3.4 and project-based activities. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Therefore, to assist the Parties to the Protocol, this Summary for Policymakers
    (SPM) provides relevant scientific and technical information in three parts:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Part I describes how the global carbon cycle operates and provides a
	context for the sections on afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation
	(ARD) and additional human-induced activities. </li>
      <li>Part II addresses important issues regarding definitions and accounting
	rules. It identifies a range of options and discusses implications and
	interrelationships among options. </li>
      <li>Part III provides information that governments might find useful in
	considering these issues:
	<ul>
	  <li>An assessment of the usefulness of models and of the usefulness
	    and costs of ground-based and remotely sensed measurements and of
	    monitoring techniques for assessing changes in carbon stocks. </li>
	  <li>The near-term (first commitment period) potential for carbon stock
	    changes/accounting of activities in Annex I countries and globally.
	  </li>
	  <li>Issues of special significance to project-based activities. </li>
	  <li>An evaluation of the applicability of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines
	    for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories for national and project-level
	    accounting in light of the Kyoto Protocol. </li>
	  <li>Implications of Articles 3.3 and 3.4 and project activities on sustainable
	    development (i.e., socioeconomic and environmental considerations)</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
