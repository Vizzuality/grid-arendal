<h4>2.2.2.1. Types of Forest Definitions</h4>
<p>There are three broad categories of forest definition: administrative, land
  use, and land cover. <br>
  <i>Administrative</i>. Forests have been defined in terms of legal or administrative
  requirements. Typical examples follow: "Any lands falling within the jurisdiction
  of the Department of XYZ" or "any lands so mapped in the ordinance survey of
  XYZ." These definitions bear no relationship to the vegetation characteristics
  and associated carbon on that land. For this reason, definitions of deforestation
  and reforestation that are based on administrative or legal definitions of forests
  may not provide as full a picture of changes in carbon stocks as some of the
  alternatives discussed below. Nevertheless, many national statistics are based
  on such definitions. This situation may lead to a confounding of information
  on forests with that for other vegetation types. </p>
<p><i>Land use.</i> Another set of definitions defines forests in terms of land
  use. A typical example follows: "An area managed for the production of timber
  and other forest products or maintained as woody vegetation for such indirect
  benefits as protection of catchment areas or recreation." Some definitions incorporate
  an element of potential or even desirable land use, such as that in the Swedish
  Forest Act of 1994: "For the purposes of this Act, forest land is defined as:
  (i) land which is suitable for wood production, and not used to a significant
  extent for other purposes; and (ii) land where tree cover is desirable in order
  to protect against sand or soil erosion, or to prevent a lowering of the tree
  line. Land that is wholly or partially unused shall not be regarded as forest
  land if, due to special conditions, it is not desirable that this land be used
  for wood production." Many definitions explicitly include areas that are temporarily
  not covered by large trees (e.g., stands of seedlings that are regrowing after
  clear-felling or disturbance) or small, included, non-treed areas (e.g., roads
  and other infrastructure). Again, these definitions may fail to reflect land
  cover. Treed areas used for purposes other than the forest land-use definition,
  such as grazed woodlands, may be excluded-along with their substantial carbon
  pools. </p>
<p>Finding a universally applicable definition of forest based on land use will
  be difficult. Such definitions may be related simply to the intent of management;
  they may require at least a minimum amount of management, or they may require
  frequent and intensive management. </p>
<p><i>Land cover.</i> The third category defines a forest in terms of vegetative
  land cover. An example follows: "An ecosystem characterized by more or less
  dense and extensive tree cover." Typically, the cover is assessed as percent
  crown cover. Distinctions may be made between open- and closed-canopy forests
  (FAO, 1999). Other variants include the use of basal area, wood volume, proportion
  of land with trees above a minimum height, or proportion of land with tree biomass
  exceeding a minimum threshold, with no distinction made between single-stem
  or multi-stem tree forms. Different elements may be combined in the definition
  of forest. For example, the definitional scenarios in <a href="123.htm">Section
  3.2</a> use three of the foregoing indicators (minimum canopy cover, minimum
  height, and minimum biomass). </p>
<p>A variety of issues arise in relation to the Protocol for each of the categories
  of forest definitions because the key activities of ARD generally involve transitions
  between forest and non-forest. Forest definitions that are based solely on land-cover
  attributes (e.g., canopy projected cover, CPC)<a href="fn3.htm#1" onClick="showFootnote(3,1); return false;"><sup>1</sup></a>
  may exclude stands of young trees that are regenerating after disturbance (e.g.,
  harvest, fire, insect outbreak, wind-throw). Some existing definitions of forest
  explicitly deal with this regeneration phase with clauses that recognize it
  to be a temporary condition. An FAO definition includes the following clause:
  "Young natural stands and all plantations established for forestry purposes
  which have yet to reach a crown density of 10 percent or tree height of 5 m
  are included under forest, as are areas normally forming part of the forest
  area which are temporarily unstocked as a result of human intervention or natural
  causes but which are expected to revert to forest." (FAO/UNEP, 1999). </p>
<p><a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a> examines the implications of using different
  components of the foregoing categories of forest definitions in combination
  with contingent definitions of ARD, using a set of definitional scenarios (<a href="123.htm">Section
  3.2</a>, <a href="113.htm#table3-1">Table 3-1</a>). </p>
<p>Minimum CPC is a common quantitative element in land cover-based definitions
  of forest. This indicator distinguishes between dense forests (closed canopy),
  in which virtually the entire land surface is covered by tree canopies (approaching
  100 percent CPC), and woodlands (open canopy)-in which the crowns of scattered
  trees or groups of trees may cover only a few percent of the land surface. In
  definitions collected by Lund (1999), the minimum CPC to be included as a forest
  varied from 10 to 70 percent. </p>
<p>Globally, about 50 percent of wooded land has a canopy cover of less than 20
  percent. This figure varies nationally, however, from 10 to about 70 percent.
  The amount varies greatly from region to region and country to country (<a href="#figure2-1">Figure
  2-1</a>). </p>

<p>Minimum forest stand dimensions are usually included within forestry definitions
  to keep the task of monitoring forested areas feasible. For the purposes of
  forestry operations, the limit is often set as low as 0.5 ha (sometimes 0.01
  ha), with minimum width of only 10 m. Although such resolution may be required
  at the scale of forestry operations, it creates practical difficulties in monitoring
  extensive areas for changes (such as those associated with ARD activities).
  The cost of monitoring rises sharply with increasing resolution. Thus, in practice,
  monitoring and reporting agencies will be constrained by the cost of measurement
  programs and by available resources. <br>
  If the upper limit of resolution is set too high, however, significant areas
  of treed land may be excluded from monitoring or reporting as forest. Similarly,
  areas of non-treed land might be reported as forest. Landscape units that consist
  of a mixture of forest and non-forest patches may be assigned a cover type that
  represents an average value for the area. If the spatial unit is very large,
  only very large scale activities will cause the average value to move below
  or above a definitional threshold of forest. Thus, smaller scale activities
  would be neither detected nor reported. </p>
<p>Ideally, the resolution should be compatible with the scale of human activities
  (e.g., clearing, planting, infrastructure). For example, consider an assessment
  over an area of 1 km<sup>2</sup> of dense forest using a forest definition incorporating
  a minimum CPC of 30 percent. Numerous human-induced openings on the scale of
  a few hectares could take place within this region without resulting in a decrease
  of the average CPC over the assessment area below the 30-percent definitional
  threshold; hence, these openings would not be recorded as deforestation. Similarly,
  forestation activities in a sparsely treed region may not be detected or recorded
  as either reforestation or afforestation. </p>
<p>The maximum spatial unit chosen will involve a tradeoff between practicality
  (cost) and the ability to identify areas where actual changes have taken place.
  The larger the spatial unit employed, the lower the proportion of ARD activities
  detected and recorded. Very large spatial units (coarse resolution) may result
  in the detection and recording of lower ARD activity rates. We note, however,
  that the detected change in cover resulting from activities may be captured
  under Article 3.4 (e.g., associated with aggradation or degradation, respectively)-a
  tradeoff that the Parties may wish to keep in mind. <a href="112.htm">Chapter
  3</a> analyzes in one of its definitional scenarios (see <a href="113.htm#table3-1">Table
  3-1</a>) an approach that captures forest degradation/aggradation activities
  within modified definitions of deforestation/reforestation. </p>
<p>The use of productivity, or potential timber-volume production, in the definition
  of a forest is relatively new in most countries. Such an approach could avoid
  the need for explicit rules relating to maximum height and canopy cover, which
  to a large extent are surrogates for timber volume and carbon content. From
  the perspective of the atmosphere, however, Net Biome Productivity (NBP) (not
  simply timber productivity) is a relevant measure (see <a href="014.htm">Chapter
  1</a>). From the Kyoto perspective (which focuses on change caused by direct
  human-induced land-use change and forestry activities), the cascading changes
  in carbon in all of the affected components (living biomass, dead organic matter,
  and organic material transported off-site) would need to be included in the
  productivity estimate if it is to reflect an accurate appraisal of carbon gains
  and losses. We return to this point in <a href="052.htm">Sections 2.2.5</a>
  and <a href="059.htm">2.3</a> and in <a href="112.htm">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="157.htm">4</a>.
