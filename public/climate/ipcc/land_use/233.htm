<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.10. Agroforests at the Margins of the Humid Tropics
</h3>
<p>The complex agroforests of Indonesia are indigenous systems invented over generations
  by local people living at the margins of tropical rainforests in Sumatra (Torquebiau,
  1984). After slash-and-burn of a primary forest, food crops are planted along
  with coffee, pepper, fruit trees (<i>Lansium domesticum</i>-duku, <i>Durio zibethinus</i>-durian),
  and the resin-producing damar tree (<i>Shorea javanica</i>). The trees eventually
  shade out the crops, occupy different strata, and produce high-value products
  such as fruits, resins, medicinals and high-grade timber (de Foresta and Michon,
  1994). Biophysical scientists have studied the productivity and ecological dimensions
  of these systems (Michon and de Foresta, 1996). Villagers in Krui, Lampung Province,
  who live off these complex agroforests obviously have a higher standard of living
  than those that grow only crops (Bouamrane, 1996). Detailed explanations of
  other best-bet agroforestry activities are described elsewhere, including activities
  that start from secondary forest fallows, reclamation of abandoned <i>Imperata</i>
  grasslands (Garrity, 1997; Friday <i>et al.</i>, 1999), or degraded pastures
  in the Amazon. </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential</b><br>
  The greatest potential area for expanding agroforestry practices and other forms
  of land-use intensification is in areas considered "degraded" at the margins
  of the humid tropics, such as many secondary forest fallows, Imperata grasslands,
  and degraded pastures. These areas amount to about 250 Mha, or 42 percent of
  the total deforested area of the humid tropics (Sanchez <i>et al.</i>, 1994).
  A major advantage of such lands is their proximity to roads and urban areas
  because they often were the first ones to be cleared. We assume that 3 percent
  of these lands (7.5 Mha) plus 20 percent of the 15 Mha annually deforested (3
  Mha)-a total of 10.5 Mha-can be put into agroforestry yearly with enabling government
  policies such as those described by Fay <i>et al.</i> (1998) and Tomich <i>et
  al.</i> (1998). </p>
<p><b>Methods </b><br>
  Changes in time-averaged aboveground and soil carbon can be measured as described
  elsewhere in this Special Report. Newly developed allometric equations for estimating
  biomass of shrubs and small trees provide an important tool (Palm <i>et al.</i>,
  2000). </p>
<p><b>Current Knowledge and Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  Data by Palm <i>et al.</i> (2000) can be used to calculate the difference between
  carbon lost when moist tropical forests are transformed into agroforests and
  carbon lost when forests are transformed into croplands or pastures. In this
  case, the estimate is 46 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>. The largest uncertainty is the area that
  will benefit from such practices. Other human-induced activities at the forest
  margins that do not include trees (e.g., active slash-and-burn cropping phase,
  pastures, and grasslands) are sources rather than sinks of carbon. </p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, and Transparency </b><br>
  A 10-year period is recommended to assess the impact on soil carbon stocks.
  Direct measurement (time-averaged) of aboveground and soil stocks should be
  used for monitoring. Combining present algorithms for estimating biomass in
  shrubs and small trees (Palm <i>et al.</i>, 2000), standard soil carbon sampling,
  and GIS techniques appears feasible. The level of carbon stock change can be
  readily verified through land-based techniques described above. Assumptions
  and methodologies associated with this practice can be explained clearly to
  facilitate replication and assessment. Scientific methods are open to review
  and replicable over time. </p>
<p><b>Permanence </b><br>
  Aboveground carbon stocks can be rapidly eliminated by shifting from this practice
  to slash-and-burn, followed by cropland or pasture. About half of the carbon
  stored in the soil is likely to have a turnover rate of >20 t C yr<sup>-1</sup>. Stopping
  the activity would lead to an estimated loss of soil carbon of 50 percent in
  about 5 years. </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  Agroforestry is an economic activity that helps to reduce or eliminate poverty
  at the forest margins if high-value products (fruits, resins, medicines, and
  high-grade timber) are produced. Agroforestry also facilitates land tenure because
  it encourages settled farming systems (Fay <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Tree-based
  systems can serve as a methane sink (Murdiyarso <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Palm <i>et
  al.</i>, 2000). Methane emitted by 1 ha of paddy rice can be absorbed by 24
  ha of agroforests if the patches are close enough in a landscape mosaic. There
  seems to be no difference in N<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions between the original forest, agroforests,
  cropland, or grassland at the humid tropical forest margins (Palm <i>et al.</i>,
  2000). </p>
<p>Agroforestry systems are more biodiverse above ground than crops, grasslands,
  and secondary forest fallows in the humid tropics (Gillison, 1999). Differences
  in below-ground biodiversity seem less important (Swift, 1999). Plant diversity
  in mature complex agroforests of Indonesia is on the order of 300 species per
  hectare, which approximates that of adjacent undisturbed forests (420 plant
  species per hectare). The diversity of bird species in these agroforests is
  approximately half that of the original rainforest, and almost all mammal species
  are present in the agroforest (de Foresta and Michon, 1994). This biodiversity
  is possible because such agroforests, which are composed of hundreds of small
  plots that are managed by individual families, occupy contiguous areas of several
  thousand hectares in Sumatra. Such agroforestry "corridors" are an important
  tool for avian biodiversity conservation in Central America (Current <i>et al.</i>,
  1998). </p>
<p>In view of human migrations to the forest margins, the optimal tradeoffs between
  carbon capture and economic and social benefits are an important policy determination.
  Examples of such tradeoffs are described by Gokowski <i>et al.</i> (1999), Vosti
  <i>et al.</i> (1999), and Tomich <i>et al.</i> (1998, 1999). </p>
<p><b>Relationship to IPCC Guidelines </b><br>
  Changes in woody biomass stocks associated with agroforestry practices can be
  included by using the procedures for estimating "changes in forest and other
  woody biomass stocks." The Guidelines do not provide specific default values
  for agroforest systems, however. Changes in soil carbon stocks can also be estimated
  using the Guidelines, although specific examples and default values for agroforest
  systems are not provided. Soil carbon stock change estimates would require values
  for "Input Factors," and potentially "Tillage Factors," related to the level
  of management of agroforests. For land-use conversions to agroforestry, "Base
  Factors" exist in the Workbook for conversions from forest and from cultivated
  land. </p>
