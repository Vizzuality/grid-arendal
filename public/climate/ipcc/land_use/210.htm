<h4>4.5.6.1. Need for Research and Technology Transfer </h4>
<p>Wood products must be affordable, safe, durable, and more cost-effective to
  be preferable to other more energy-intensive alternatives. Research plays a
  key role in developing new applications, improving processing efficiency, and
  extending product life spans. Policy and its implementation play a crucial role
  in promoting technology transfer and technological and economic transition,
  particularly in developing countries. </p>
<h4><a name="s4-5-6-2"></a>4.5.6.2. Impacts on Forest Resources </h4>
<p>FAO (1999) has projected that the annual production of wood will reach almost
  3.7 billion m<sup>3</sup> by 2010. The demand for industrial roundwood is expected to increase
  by 1.7 percent annually between 1996 and 2010, driven by population growth,
  market forces, and new policies that address climate change issues. </p>
<p>If these projections are realized, investment in reforestation, afforestation,
  and forest management activities will have to rise accordingly, and timber supplies
  may increase. This trend may imply increased carbon stocks in forest products-but
  also more pressure on forest resources. Climate change mitigation requirements
  will have to be balanced with other requirements, such as soil and water protection,
  wildlife habitat, or biodiversity. </p>
<h4><a name="s4-5-6-3"></a>4.5.6.3. Economic Impacts </h4>
<p>At the global level, forestry is estimated to contribute only 2 percent toward
  the world's GDP and 3 percent to international trade. The estimated value of
  wood consumption in 1996 exceeds US$400 billion, with industrial usage accounting
  for 75 percent. Forest products are the main source of foreign exchange for
  several countries. Any change in the status of their forests is likely to affect
  their balance of trade. Measures aimed at mitigating climate change may open
  new opportunities for the development of the forestry sector, but provision
  must be made to avoid negative impacts. </p>
<h4><a name="s4-5-6-4"></a>4.5.6.4. Construction of a "Closed Carbon Cycle" </h4>
<p>Actions and measures for the sequestration and displacement of carbon by means
  of forest management, forest products, and bioenergy constitute a "closed carbon
  cycle." These actions are closely linked to other priority areas, such as food
  production, erosion control, and biodiversity protection. These actions can
  be tailored to different economic situations, industrial conditions, resources
  availability, consumption patterns, and social and cultural behaviors. It is
  important to recognize, however, that they must be carefully planned and monitored
  at national and local levels to generate a perpetual cycle of tree planting
  and forest product utilization. </p>
