<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.6. Grazing Management </h3>
<p>Grazing management alters the amount and consumption of biomass by domestic
  animals and wildlife to achieve production and other goals. This technique requires
  management of intensity, frequency, and seasonality of grazing and animal distribution.
</p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  Grazing influences carbon and nutrient cycling, as well as many other properties
  of grassland ecosystems (e.g., species composition, light interception, soil
  compaction). Grazing results in some of the plant carbon being routed through
  the digestive tracts of animals-where some is converted to weight gain, some
  is emitted as CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and CH<span class="subscript">4</span>, and 25-50 percent is returned in wastes to the grassland.
  The response of soil carbon stocks to grazing intensity varies for different
  grasslands. In general, where grazing is managed to maintain or increase plant
  productivity, soil carbon stocks can be maintained or increased (Conant <i>et
  al.</i>, 2000). Overgrazing-the definition of which is determined by social
  and economic values, as well as ecosystem function (Abel, 1997)-to the extent
  of significantly decreasing primary productivity and stimulating erosion decreases
  soil carbon. For example, Li <i>et al.</i> (1997) reported that overgrazing
  during a 40-year period in Inner Mongolia resulted in a 12.4 percent loss of
  soil carbon. </p>
<p>In northern Australia, 40 percent of grazing lands have been degraded, resulting
  in increased incidence of annual grasses and reduced cover of perennial grasses
  (Tothill and Gillies, 1992). Adoption of reduced stocking rates to increase
  perennial grasses could sequester 315 Mt C in the top 10 cm of soil over 30
  years (Ash <i>et al.</i>, 1996); this management change often does not significantly
  reduce farm income (Stafford Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1999). The 0-10 cm layer contains
  about 16 percent of the profile soil carbon (Dalal and Carter, 1999); thus,
  total storage may be much greater. The rate of establishment of perennial grasses
  appears to determine the rate of recovery of soil carbon (Burke <i>et al.</i>,
  1995). Soil carbon can be lost from these systems-through a combination of inappropriate
  management and drought-much more quickly than it can be replaced (Bridge <i>et
  al.</i>, 1983; Northup and Brown, 1999). Thus, a continuity of management purpose
  is required to maintain or increase soil carbon reliably. </p>
<p>Developing countries face additional problems in that the change from nomadic/semi-nomadic
  grazing management to permanent settlements may result in overgrazing and increased
  soil carbon losses (Togtohyn <i>et al.</i>, 1996). In tropical pastures established
  after deforestation, overgrazing and nutrient deficiencies have resulted in
  soil erosion and soil carbon losses, weed invasion, and land degradation (Feller,
  1993; Woomer <i>et al.</i>, 1997). In contrast, appropriate pasture management
  can lead to increased soil carbon levels compared with the native forest (Lugo
  <i>et al.</i>, 1986; Cerri <i>et al.</i>, 1991; Lugo and Brown, 1996); Neill
  <i>et al.</i> (1997) estimate a potential soil carbon increase of 12-18 t C
  ha<sup>-1</sup> in the top 30 cm of soil. </p>
<p><b>Current Knowledge and Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  Data exist for many locations, predominately in temperate countries but increasingly
  in tropical regions. Most studies use paired-site measurements, which have higher
  uncertainties than time series-based measurements. The mechanisms by which grazing
  influences ecosystem carbon storage are relatively well understood, but the
  magnitude of carbon change as a function of grazing intensity is uncertain for
  many grasslands. Rates of increase of soil carbon are likely to be higher in
  more mesic environments than in drier ones (<a href="171.htm#table4-4">Table
  4-4</a>); woodlands and native grasslands show the greatest increases (Conant
  <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Environmental changes such as climate variability, climate
  change, and atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> increases are likely to impact carbon stocks. </p>
<p><b>Methods</b><br>
  Where direct sampling is used, soil ideally should be measured throughout the
  profile (1 m or more) because of deep carbon storage with some species. In at
  least some environments, surface soil carbon is correlated with pasture condition
  (Ash <i>et al.</i>, 1996), which could be assessed using field measurements
  and/or remote sensing (Bastin <i>et al.</i>, 1998)-providing the potential for
  regular, large-scale, geographically referenced assessments. Rapid, direct assessments
  of aboveground pasture biomass at site (Tothill <i>et al.</i>, 1992; Waite,
  1994) and regional scales (Hassett <i>et al.</i>, 1999) are well established.
  Allometric relationships allow estimation of root biomass. </p>
<p><b>Time Scale </b><br>
  Carbon accumulation from improved grazing could extend for 25-50 years or more
  depending on the rate of plant productivity response. Low rates of change in
  soil carbon (e.g., because of slow plant recovery from overgrazing) will be
  associated with long recovery times (Burke <i>et al.</i>, 1995); conversely,
  rapid increases in soil carbon will tend to diminish more rapidly over time.
  Soil carbon content and bulk density can be measured at intervals of 5 years
  or more to depths of 1 m or more, depending on species and soil conditions (see
  <a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a>). </p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, and Transparency </b><br>
  Rates of change could be verified through repeated field measurements (soil
  and vegetation) over time, for representative grassland types and grazing regimes.
  Existing grassland carbon models that incorporate grazing, appropriately parameterized,
  could be used in verification. Conventional vegetation mapping and/or remote
  sensing can be used in conjunction with country statistics to verify the areal
  extent of grazing lands of different types. Statistics or surveys of animal
  stocking rates could be used for rough estimates of past and current grazing
  intensity. </p>
<p><b>Removals</b><br>
  Biomass is removed by livestock and other herbivores, by fire, and through detachment
  and decomposition. Soil carbon is removed mainly by decomposition and erosion.
  Both processes are strongly influenced by management. </p>
<p><b>Permanence</b><br>
  If continuity of management purpose is maintained, storage of carbon in soils
  and root biomass can provide pools that persist for years to centuries. </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  Improved land conditions where overgrazing is addressed reduces erosion; reduces
  methane emissions by reducing animal numbers and improving intake quality; and
  is likely to reduce nitrous oxide emissions as a result of lower levels of excreted
  nitrogen (Howden <i>et al.</i>, 1994) and probably greater uptake by vegetation.
</p>
<p><b>Relationship to IPCC Guidelines </b><br>
  Procedures for estimating grazing effects on carbon stocks are not explicitly
  defined in the Guidelines. For soil carbon, however, grazing effects will be
  a function largely of changes in productivity and carbon additions to soils,
  which can be addressed through the selection of input factors (Reference Manual).
  In addition, default values are provided for improved, unimproved, and degraded
  pasture soils (Workbook). </p>
