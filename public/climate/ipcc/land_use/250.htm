<h3>5.1.2. Characteristics of Projects </h3>
<p>A LULUCF project can be defined as a planned set of activities within a specific
  geographic location that is implemented by a specific set of subnational or,
  occasionally, national institutions. These activities may relate to Articles
  3.3, 3.4, or 6 of the Kyoto Protocol-and possibly to Article 12, should LULUCF
  activities be included for certified emissions reductions (CERs) in the Clean
  Development Mechanism (CDM). There are important differences, however, between
  the status of LULUCF projects, activities, and enabling policies under these
  Articles, hence between countries with and without assigned amounts (see <a href="#figure5-1">Figure
  5-1</a>): </p>
<ul>
  <li>Annex I Parties have taken on commitments to reach assigned amounts of GHG
    emissions by the end of the first commitment period, thus will have national
    GHG inventories and accounting systems in place to meet these commitments.
    Articles 3.3 and 3.4 impose limitations on which LULUCF activities are eligible
    (see <a href="038.htm">Chapters 2</a>, <a href="112.htm">3</a>, and <a href="157.htm">4</a>);
    a project-based approach is possible under Article 3.4 (<a href="157.htm">Chapter
    4</a>). The national assigned-amount commitment may allow Annex I Parties
    to account for emissions reduction or sequestration across Articles 3.3, 3.4,
    and 6 as lands or activities move among the Articles-potentially minimizing
    the risk of leakage of GHGs (see <a href="263.htm">Section 5.3.3</a>).</li>
  <li>Policies by governments, the private sector, or nongovernmental organizations
    (NGOs) can facilitate or hinder the socioeconomic and policy conditions that
    are likely to encourage the diffusion of LULUCF activities or projects. For
    example, land tenure, agricultural subsidy, and timber concession or taxation
    policies have a strong impact on the financial and practical feasibility of
    many forest or agricultural activities that could generate GHG benefits, such
    as rates of deforestation or afforestation (e.g., Repetto and Gillis, 1988).
    These policies are not likely to directly produce emissions reductions or
    sequestration under Articles 3.3, 3.4, 6, or 12, but they may produce enabling
    conditions.</li>
  <li>Under Article 6, emissions reduction units (ERUs) in Annex I Parties can
    be generated only by LULUCF activities that are organized as projects; under
    Article 12, certified emissions reductions can be generated only by projects,
    which <i>may</i> include LULUCF activities. </li>
  <li>Thus, LULUCF activities that are not implemented as projects are likely
    to be excluded under Articles 6 and 12. Dispersed, individual actions of land
    users and beneficial policy changes that are not instituted as projects and
    may have dispersed GHG impacts but cannot be readily measured and verified
    are not likely to be included in these Articles unless they are specifically
    organized as projects. </li>
</ul>
<p>Many potential LULUCF project activities, taken together, can reduce net emissions
  of a wide range of GHGs. Project experience to date, however, has been limited
  mostly to reductions in carbon emissions and enhancement of carbon stocks, as
  well as forestry operations. This chapter therefore concentrates on carbon and
  forestry, although it refers to other gases and types of projects where pertinent
  and where information is available. </p>

<p>There are three broad categories of LULUCF projects, each with a variety of
  subtypes: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Emissions reduction through conservation of existing carbon stocks:</i>
    For example, avoidance of deforestation or improved forest management-including
    alternative harvest practices such as reduced-impact logging or fire and pest
    protection.</li>
  <li><i>Carbon sequestration by the increase of carbon stocks:</i> For example,
    afforestation, reforestation, agroforestry, enhanced natural regeneration,
    revegetation of degraded lands, reduced soil tillage and other agricultural
    practices to increase soil carbon, or extended lifetimes of wood products.</li>
  <li><i>Carbon substitution:</i> For example, use of sustainably grown biofuels
    to replace fossil fuels or biomass to replace energy-intensive materials such
    as bricks, cement, steel, and plastic.</li>
</ul>
<p>The eligibility of these different types of LULUCF projects under the Kyoto
  Protocol and many of the rules that apply to them still have to be decided and
  formulated. The outcome of this policymaking process will have a large bearing
  on the potential-and costs-of LULUCF projects as a means of mitigating GHG emissions
  while contributing to sustainable development.</p>
<p>The very concepts of LULUCF mitigation projects generally and joint implementation
  (JI) projects specifically-projects that mitigate GHG emissions by Annex I countries
  in non-Annex I countries, established under the United Nations Framework Convention
  on Climate Change (UNFCCC)-have been challenged in a growing body of literature.
  Critics raise three general sets of questions (e.g., Maya and Gupta, 1996; Mulongoy
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Lashof and Hare, 1999; Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1999). First,
  do LULUCF projects provide measurable, verifiable, long-term GHG emissions avoidance
  or reductions? This concern relates to projects' ability to construct reasonable,
  empirically based, without-project baselines and to quantify leakage of GHGs
  across project borders to other areas or markets. Second, can LULUCF projects
  meet tests for sustainable development and be compatible with national sustainable
  development priorities? Should other policy tests be required for their use
  under Articles 6 and 12? Third, under what policy circumstances might LULUCF
  projects be used in the Kyoto Protocol to provide Annex B certified emissions
  reductions? Should they be limited to fostering energy sector emissions reductions?
  The technical issues raised are addressed in the following sections. </p>
