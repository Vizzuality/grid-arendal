<h4>5.3.3.2. Methods for Monitoring Leakage </h4>
<p>To date, two approaches have been used and proposed to monitor leakage. One
  approach involves determining the appropriate spatial area in which to monitor
  project effects; the other involves identifying key indicators of leakage on
  the basis of demand that drives land-use change and management. </p>
<p><i>Monitoring by Area:</i> Leakage may be monitored by expanding the project's
  boundary. The monitoring area may be larger than the area on which project activities
  are implemented (Brown, 1997; Trexler and Associates, 1998). Potential monitoring
  boundaries for leakage are at the project level, the local/regional level, or
  the global level: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Project activity boundaries:</i> Projects implemented on land that has
    few or no competing uses may have to consider only the area of direct project
    activities because the project's impact is unlikely to extend beyond its immediate
    boundaries. For example, the RUSAFOR project (see <a href="253.htm#table5-2">Table
    5-2</a>) has no competing land uses, and the timber will not be harvested.</li>
  <li><i>Regional/local boundaries:</i> Where land has competing uses or in dynamic
    settings where factors such as emigration, population growth, and fuelwood
    gathering are important, a project's impact is likely to extend beyond its
    immediate boundary and may extend to the local area or region (Brown, 1998).
    For example, monitoring can be expanded to include the local cattle, timber,
    or food market (Chomitz, 2000).</li>
  <li><i>Global market boundaries:</i> Still other projects-notably, those involving
    timber harvesting or agricultural production for export-may be operating in
    a global market. In these cases, if the project causes a restriction on the
    goods produced, leakage may occur because the project will be unable to affect
    global market demand. For example, a logging project in which the timber is
    for a global market could monitor regional wood product production surveys,
    regional or national wood product flows, or survey mills (Brown <i>et al.</i>,
    2000).</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Monitoring by Key Indicators:</i> Alternately, it has been proposed that
  leakage be monitored by determining key indicators for demand that drives land-use
  patterns or management that leads to carbon emissions (such as demand for timber,
  fuelwood, or agricultural land) (Brown <i>et al.</i>, 1997). The key indicator
  is the output of the product demanded. A project that reduces output or access
  to resources without offering alternatives is likely to result in leakage because
  people within the project area will move elsewhere to find other sources of
  resource supply. A review at the project level has suggested that leakage indicators
  can be developed by determining whether the project has displaced activities
  that lead to carbon emissions, rather than replacing or substituting for them
  (Brown <i>et al.</i>, 1997). For example, to monitor leakage potential for a
  project that seeks to replace conventional logging with reduced-impact logging,
  timber output would be the key indicator to be monitored. If timber output from
  the project area decreases while prices and demand for wood products remain
  the same, the project could have leakage. The assumption would be that additional
  areas would be logged to compensate for the timber loss (Brown <i>et al.</i>,
  1997). Under this method, it would be unnecessary to track global markets or
  the harvest intensity of nearby timber concessions; instead, the key indicator
  of output would be used to monitor the leakage potential. Similarly where demand
  for agricultural land is driving land-use change: If conversion of forest to
  agricultural land is halted but agricultural productivity is not increased on
  existing lands, the project is likely to result in leakage. </p>
<p>Several projects have developed leakage indicators. In the Noel Kempff Mercado
  project, for example, the government of Bolivia used carbon mitigation funds
  to compensate forest concessionaires for giving up logging rights on government-owned
  forest lands and expand the park boundaries (<a href="#box5-3">Box 5-3</a>).
  A legally binding "leakage agreement" was signed by the logging companies, obliging
  them not to invest the funds they received in logging elsewhere. The key indicators
  are the use of received carbon funds and the harvesting rates in the concessions.
  The concessionaires will be monitored to ensure that they do not increase production
  elsewhere because of the project funding (Brown <i>et al.</i>, 2000). </p>

	<p>The project area of approximately 634,000 ha is located within the
	  newly expanded western region of the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park.
	  Prior to the initiation of the NKCAP, much of the forest in the expansion
	  area had been high-graded over a period of about 15 years. In addition
	  to logging, this area was also under pressure for conversion to agriculture
	  (for further details, see Brown <i>et al.</i>, 2000). The forests in
	  the expansion area were divided into six strata for sampling: tall evergreen,
	  liana, tall inundated, short inundated, mixed liana, and burned forest.
	</p>
	<p>The project design for inventorying and monitoring the carbon pools
	  in the with-project case is based on the methodology and protocols in
	  MacDicken (1997a). The carbon inventory of the area was based on data
	  collected from a network of 625 permanent plots; the number of plots
	  sampled in a given strata was based on the variance of an initial sample
	  of plots in each strata and the desired precision level (�10 percent)
	  with 95-percent confidence. A fixed-area, nested-plot design was used,
	  and carbon stocks were measured or calculated for each of the following
	  pools in each plot: all trees with diameter at breast height >5 cm,
	  understory, fine litter standing stock, standing dead wood, and soil
	  to 30-cm depth. Root biomass was estimated from root-to-shoot ratios
	  given in Cairns <i>et al.</i> (1997). The total amount of carbon in
	  the park expansion area was about 115 million t C, most of which was
	  in aboveground biomass of trees (60 percent), followed by soil to 30-cm
	  depth (18 percent), roots (12 percent), and dead wood (7 percent); the
	  understory and fine litter accounted for about 3 percent of the total.
	  The 95-percent confidence interval of the total carbon stock was �4
	  percent, based on sampling error only; regression and measurement error
	  were not included. </p>
	<p><i><b>Averted Logging </b></i></p>
	<p>The carbon benefits from this activity result from halting the removal
	  of commercial timber and eliminating damage to the residual stand. Estimates
	  of changes in major carbon pools from logging and projections of timber
	  extraction if logging had been allowed to continue over the project
	  life were assessed to generate the without-project baseline. The main
	  carbon pools considered in this activity are aboveground tree biomass,
	  dead biomass, and wood products. Bolivia recently enacted a new forestry
	  law and developed new regulations for forest harvesting. This information
	  is used to predict how much forest area in the project area would have
	  been harvested in a given year for each year over the length of the
	  project. From data provided by logging concessionaires, and analysis
	  of concessionaire management plans in areas nearby, the likely quantity
	  of wood (in cubic meters per hectare) extracted per year is also estimated.
	</p>
	<p>The change in carbon stocks from logging activities is measured in
	  a nearby proxy forest concession. Permanent plots are established to
	  measure the amount of dead biomass produced during the felling of a
	  tree and associated activities, as well as the rate of regrowth after
	  harvesting. Dead biomass results from the crown and stump of the felled
	  timber tree and damage to other trees. Total production of dead biomass
	  carbon per unit of harvested biomass carbon is determined from these
	  plots. </p>
	<p align="center"><i>C benefits from averted logging = Dlive biomass C
	  + Ddead biomass C + Dwood product C </i></p>
	<p>where D is the difference in carbon stocks between the with- and the
	  without-project case. The annual benefits are calculated from a carbon
	  accounting model that tracks all of the changes in these pools from
	  a scenario that is based on the annual area logged, log extraction rates,
	  and logging damage. </p>
	<p>Dlive biomass C = (biomass C from logging damage + C in timber extracted)
	  x growth factor </p>
	<p>To estimate the change in live biomass, one could measure the live
	  biomass in the proxy concession before an area was logged and then again
	  after it was logged; the difference would give the change in the live
	  biomass C. One main problem with this approach, however, is that two
	  large carbon stocks are being subtracted; although the error on each
	  stock could be small, the error on the difference, expressed as a percentage,
	  will be much larger. To overcome this problem, the change in live biomass
	  was measured directly. The change in live biomass between the with-
	  and without-project cases is a result of the extraction of timber and
	  damage to residual trees from logging activities (the quantity in parentheses).
	  The quantity in parentheses, expressed on an area basis, multiplied
	  by the area logged per year gives the total change in live biomass without
	  adjustment for logging effects on the growth of the residual stand (the
	  growth factor). It is not clear if harvesting stimulates or reduces
	  regrowth in recently logged areas. The logging of large trees and damage
	  to residual trees may be enough to actually reduce net biomass growth
	  of the stand per unit area for several years after logging rather than
	  stimulate it. For projects that prevent or modify logging, this effect
	  of logging on the growth of the residual trees must be determined. Monitoring
	  of paired permanent plots in logged and unlogged areas of the proxy
	  concession is under way to establish the sign and magnitude of the growth
	  factor over the length of the project. </p>
	<p>Ddead biomass C = (dead biomass from logging damage x decomposition
	  factor) </p>
	<p>In projects that are related to preventing or reducing logging, dead
	  wood cannot be ignored because it is a long-lived pool, and logging
	  increases the size of this pool. Thus, stopping logging has the effect
	  of reducing the dead biomass carbon stock, and the dead biomass carbon
	  in the with-project case is less than in the without-project case. The
	  change in the dead biomass pool has to be corrected for decomposition,
	  however. Estimates of the decomposition correction factor are taken
	  from the literature (Delaney <i>et al.</i>, 1998), but field measurements
	  are under way to improve this factor. </p>
	<p>Dwood products C = (timber extracted x proportion converted to long-lived
	  products) </p>
	<p>Stopping logging reduces the long-term wood product pool because the
	  input of new products is reduced; thus, the change in the wood products
	  pool is negative. The harvested timber in the Santa Cruz area is from
	  a small number of speciality tree species; a reduction in their supply
	  may not be supplied from elsewhere. In the NKCAP, the proportion of
	  harvested roundwood that goes into long-term wood products was obtained
	  from literature sources for Brazil (Winjum <i>et al.</i>, 1998). The
	  project assumed that wood waste generated at each stage of the conversion
	  of timber to products (50 percent was converted to sawdust in the first
	  milling stage) was oxidized in the year of harvest. </p>
	<p>The difference between the with- and the without-project case is that
	  the with-project case has more carbon in the live biomass pool and less
	  carbon in the dead biomass and wood product pools than the without-project
	  case. </p>
	<p><i><b>Averted Conversion to Agriculture</b></i></p>
	<p>The carbon benefits from this activity result from the elimination
	  of carbon loss in forest biomass and soil. The without-project baseline
	  for this component was established by using projected human demographics
	  in areas adjacent to the project area. The two factors affecting conversion
	  of forestlands to agriculture in the area surrounding the NKCAP are
	  increasing human populations and the resulting demand for farmland.
	  In constructing the deforestation scenario, it was assumed that migration
	  into the area will fuel continued demand for agricultural land, as in
	  other areas nearby the NKCAP. </p>
	<p align="center"><i>C benefits from averted forest conversion = Dtotal
	  biomass C + Dsoil C </i></p>
	<p>Carbon loss from a change in biomass is calculated as the product of
	  the projected area cleared and the difference between carbon in forest
	  biomass (the sum of trees, understory, litter, dead wood, and roots)
	  and agriculture crop biomass. Changes in soil carbon are estimated as
	  the product of area cleared, weighted average forest soil carbon, and
	  an average soil oxidation rate for converted tropical forest soils obtained
	  from Detwiler (1986).</p>
