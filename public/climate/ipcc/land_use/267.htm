<h3>5.3.4. Project Duration </h3>
<h4><a name="s5-3-4-1"></a>5.3.4.1. How Long Do Projects Have To Be Run? </h4>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol requires that LULUCF projects result in long-term changes
  in terrestrial carbon storage and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentrations in the atmosphere. The
  definition of "long-term" varies substantially, however, and there is no consensus
  regarding a minimum time frame for project duration. </p>
<p>During the AIJ Pilot Phase, projects have been conducted for a variety of time
  frames: from 20 years [e.g., the PAP in Costa Rica (Trines, 1998a)] to 99 years
  [e.g., the FACE Foundation projects (Verweij and Emmer, 1998)]. Most projects
  state that their GHG benefits are expected to be maintained beyond the project
  time frame [see the list of AIJ projects on the UNFCCC Web site (UNFCCC, 1999b)],
  although their contractual arrangements are finite. This lack of definition
  has caused uncertainty to all parties involved-from regulatory bodies to project
  developers and investors. </p>
<p>There is a need, therefore, to agree on what time frame should be used as the
  basis for quantification of GHG benefits of a project. Different time frames
  or approaches have been proposed to define the duration of projects: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Perpetuity;</i> Under this approach the environmental benefits of projects
    must be maintained forever. This argument is based on the assumption that
    the reversal of GHG benefits from a project at any point in time would totally
    invalidate the project (Carbon Storage Trust, 1998; Maclaren, 1999) and that
    only maintenance of carbon stocks in perpetuity could counter the environmental
    effects of GHG emissions from fossil fuel sources. It is also argued that
    this approach is the only one that is compatible with the stock change method
    currently used by the IPCC for national GHG inventories (Houghton <i>et al.</i>,
    1997). Criticisms of this approach argue that it is impossible to guarantee
    that a project will be run in perpetuity; that maintenance of projects in
    perpetuity may create conflicts with other land uses in the long term; and
    that because of the decay pattern of GHGs in the atmosphere, there is no need
    for mitigation effects to be perpetual</li>
  <li><i> 100 years:</i> Under this approach, the GHG benefits of a project must
    be maintained for a period of 100 years to be consistent with the Kyoto Protocol's
    adoption of the IPCC's GWPs (Article 5.3) and the Protocol's 100-year reference
    time frame (Addendum to the Protocol, Decision 2/CP.3, para. 3) for calculation
    of the AGWP for CO<span class="subscript">2</span>. Although this concept has limitations (IPCC, 1996), it
    has been adopted for use in the Kyoto Protocol to account for total emissions
    of GHGs on a CO<span class="subscript">2</span>-equivalent basis. </li>
  <li><i> Equivalence based:</i> Under this approach, the GHG benefits of LULUCF
    mitigation projects must be maintained until they counteract the effect of
    an equivalent amount of GHGs emitted to the atmosphere, estimated on the basis
    of the cumulative radiative forcing effect of a pulse emission of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> during
    its residence in the atmosphere (i.e., its AGWP) (IPCC, 1992). Variations
    of this concept have been developed that proposed minimum time frames of 55
    years (Moura-Costa and Wilson, 2000) or 100 years (Fearnside <i>et al.</i>,
    2000) (see <a href="038.htm">Chapter 2</a>). </li>
  <li> <i>Variable:</i> This approach acknowledges that different projects may
    have different operational time frames. Given the wide range of time frames
    of projects carried out to date, it can be inferred that this approach has
    been adopted during the AIJ Pilot Phase. </li>
</ul>
<p>Adoption of a standard definition of the minimum required time frame for project
  duration would greatly facilitate consistency in accounting for the GHG benefits
  of different projects. It would also reduce the uncertainty of all parties involved
  in project development (project developers, investors, certifiers, regulatory
  bodies, and the general public). </p>
