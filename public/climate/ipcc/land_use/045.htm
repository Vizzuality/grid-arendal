<h4>2.2.1.1. Land Use </h4>
<p>The terms "land cover" and "land use" are often confused. <i>Land cover</i>
  is "the observed physical and biological cover of the earth's land, as vegetation
  or man-made features." In contrast, land use is "the total of arrangements,
  activities, and inputs that people undertake in a certain land cover type" (FAO,
  1997a; FAO/UNEP, 1999). National categories of land use differ, but many have
  been harmonized under the influence of FAO's periodical World Census of Agriculture
  (<a href="#table2-1">Table 2-1</a>). Categories of land cover/use systems are
  used in <a href="157.htm">Chapter 4</a> (<a href="171.htm">Section 4.4</a>)
  to illustrate the expected potential for carbon sequestration from a change
  in system management (e.g., intensification or extensification) or upon conversion
  from one category to another.</p>

<h4><a name="s2-2-1-2"></a>2.2.1.2. Forestry </h4>
<p>A common dictionary and glossary definition of forestry is "the science, art,
  and practice of managing and using for human benefit the natural resources that
  occur on and in association with forest lands." Thus <i>forestry</i> is a broader
  term than <i>silviculture</i>, which refers more specifically to the planting
  and tending of growing trees. For the purposes of this Special Report, forestry
  is taken to include a wide range of activities in addition to those associated
  with silviculture, including the production of non-timber products, watershed
  management, wildlife protection, and eco-tourism and extending to activities
  such as pest control and fire management. The question remains, however: What
  are forest lands? </p>
<p>Although <i>forest land</i> has many national definitions, many of these definitions
  have the following in common: "All lands bearing vegetative associations dominated
  by trees of any size, exploited or not, capable of producing wood or other forest
  products, of exerting an influence on climate or on water regime, or providing
  shelter for livestock or wildlife. Includes lands which have been clear-cut
  or burned but which will be reforested in the foreseeable future. Excludes orchards,
  shelter belts, groups of trees along roads or city parks" (Encyclopaedia Britannica,
  1970). Woodlands and treed wetlands that fit the minimum definitions of forest
  are usually included. </p>
<p>These definitions, however, have been developed for a variety of purposes that
  rarely include aspects of measuring carbon stocks and changes in stocks as required
  by the Protocol. Thus, <a href="#s2-2-2">Section 2.2.2</a> deals in more detail
  with the definitions of a forest and associated terms in the context of the
  Protocol. </p>
<h3><a name="s2-2-2"></a>2.2.2. Definitions of Forests </h3>
<p>Forests are usually composed of many individual stands in different stages
  of development and with different characteristics. Thus, a forest can include
  a range of different forested ecosystems composed of different species and different
  ages and having different carbon stock densities (t C ha<sup>-1</sup>). In this Special
  Report, the term forest refers to the whole forest (as a landscape), including
  its forest stands (its component units). The term stand is used where necessary
  for clarity. </p>
<p>Many definitions of forest are in use throughout the world, reflecting wide
  differences in biogeophysical conditions, social structures, and economies.
  Lund (1999) listed about 240 such definitions. Most countries have developed
  very specific definitions that are suitable for their own administrative purposes
  and reflect their forests' ecological conditions. In seeking a set of definitions
  for the Protocol, it must be recognized that many national agencies have invested
  significantly in databases that are founded on their own definitions. Many agencies
  will be unwilling or unable to reformulate that information if arbitrary definitions
  devised to implement the Protocol are too dissimilar from their own. </p>
