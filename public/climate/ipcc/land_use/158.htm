<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The chapter addresses the implications of including-as adjustments to assigned
  amounts under the Kyoto Protocol-the effects of activities related to land use,
  land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) other than those covered by Article 3.3.
  It derives a set of core questions from Article 3.4 of the Protocol and arranges
  these questions in a sequence designed to help decisionmakers work through issues
  such as which additional human-induced activities should be included and how
  those activities should be defined, measured, reported, monitored, and verified.
</p>
<p>Although Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol applies only to Parties listed in
  Annex I, examples and estimates that are relevant to current Annex I and non-Annex
  I countries are included because the list of countries interested in controlling
  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is likely to grow in the future. The numerous
  potential practices are summarized in broad activity groups, and
  "<a href="157.htm#fact-sheets">Fact Sheets</a>"
  presenting the details of individual practices are included after the reference
  section. </p>
<p>The potential global impact of these additional LULUCF activities in Annex
  I countries in the first commitment period is estimated to be up to 0.52 Gt
  C yr<sup>-1</sup>. The combined Annex I and non-Annex I impact could reach 2.5 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>
  in 40 years (<a href="#table4-1">Table 4-1</a>). These estimates include only
  on-site carbon stock changes; reductions of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions caused by the increased
  use of bioenergy or wood products are not included. The estimates are based
  on reviewed studies and the assumption that economic, social, and technical
  constraints will limit the land that is actually available for these activities
  to a small percentage of the land that is theoretically available. The main
  component of the large uncertainty associated with these estimates relates to
  where, and to what extent, LULUCF activities may occur. Once those facts are
  known, the estimates of GHG impacts of a given activity in a given location
  are far less uncertain. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Change in management within a land use or change in land use to one with a
  higher potential carbon stock can increase carbon stocks in an ecosystem, leading
  to a net removal of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> from the atmosphere. The carbon is stored as soil carbon,
  wood, leaf, root, and litter biomass. These different carbon pools have mean
  residence times that range from days to millennia. The stable carbon pools remain
  virtually unchanged over very long periods if management, climate, and disturbance
  regimes do not change. The rate at which ecosystems can accumulate carbon, the
  ultimate size of the pools, and the rate at which the carbon can be lost again
  under altered circumstances all depend on the form of the newly stored carbon,
  the magnitude of the land-use or management change, the inherent biological
  productivity of the site, and the type and depth of the soil. </p>
<p>The net effect of LULUCF activities on the atmosphere depends not only on changes
  in on-site carbon stocks but also on: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The lifetime of carbon in agricultural and forest products and how they
    replace other products that require more or less energy to produce and use</li>
  <li>Concomitant changes in the net fluxes of other GHGs (especially CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and
    N<span class="subscript">2</span>O)</li>
  <li>Changes in GHG emissions resulting from changes in the fossil fuel energy
    needed to maintain the new land-use practices </li>
  <li>Changes in non-GHG-related radiant forcing (such as changes in albedo).</li>
</ul>
<p>These non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> effects can add to, or reduce, the effects from CO<span class="subscript">2</span>. In several
  important cases, the non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> effects are sufficiently large that failure to
  include them in the accounting procedure would lead to substantially misleading
  conclusions. For example, changes in CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and N<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions resulting from management
  changes in wetlands, rice crops, or dryland crops can offset a large portion
  of changes in the carbon stock. </p>
<p>The capacity to store on-site carbon through LULUCF activities is finite because
  the land area available for this purpose has competing uses and is limited and
  because the carbon pools have practical upper limits. Although the rates suggested
  in <a href="#table4-1">Table 4-1</a> will eventually decline, they are considered
  to be applicable for a 30- to 50-year period. </p>
<p>The potential contribution of these additional LULUCF activities to the reduction
  of global radiative forcing is therefore a substantial portion of the total
  human-induced effect, though it is too small to balance current fossil fuel
  emissions by itself. Including major LULUCF activities as adjustments to the
  assigned amounts under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol could
  potentially reduce the degree to which many countries may need to alter energy
  use and energy production technology in the short term. </p>
<p>The opportunities for reducing the net flux of GHGs to the atmosphere through
  the application of these activities is large because of the extensive areas
  of cropland, agroforests, grazing lands, and forests that exist. The associated
  impacts-in terms of altered crop, animal, and tree production; water yield;
  biodiversity; energy use; and socioeconomic effects-are in many cases significant;
  these impacts can be negative or positive (frequently a mixture of both), depending
  on the specific activity and the environment in which it is applied. In deciding
  whether to develop policies or programs to encourage these activities, the associated
  non-climate benefits and tradeoffs of the activities are usually very important
  factors and may dominate over climate considerations at a local or national
  scale (<a href="218.htm">Section 4.7</a>). </p>
<p>Decisions about how additional activities will be implemented under the Protocol
  will significantly affect the cost and difficulty of implementation by the Parties,
  as well as the choice of reporting methods that will be used (particularly in
  the initial years). Carbon stocks in agricultural soils and forests can be measured,
  monitored, and verified by a range of methods with varying precision. The cost
  of measurement increases with the required precision. The methods continue to
  improve in accuracy and cost-effectiveness. One impact of including additional
  activities will be accelerated development and improved cost-effectiveness of
  new methods. </p>
<p>There are two basic options for inclusion of additional LULUCF activities:
  include a limited list of activities, or include essentially all LULUCF activities
  that affect carbon pools and/or GHG fluxes. Choosing to include a very limited
  list of additional activities may reduce short-term demands on a Party's accounting
  system, but it may fail to encourage activities and practices that have important
  impacts on the atmosphere and benefits for environmental quality and sustainable
  development and may result in displacement of emissions into areas or activities
  that are not included. A reporting regime in which a large number of small land
  areas must be monitored and tracked far into the future may make some practices
  (particularly those that tend to shift from place to place over time) very expensive
  to monitor and verify operationally. In that case, accounting for the main carbon
  stock changes over the entire land area of the country-as is done by some current
  national inventory systems-may be a more cost-effective approach in the long
  run. Such full-area accounting may simplify accounting procedures by allowing
  one set of rules to apply everywhere, making the precise definition of different
  land uses and LULUCF activities less critical and enabling a statistical sampling
  approach rather than spatially explicit recordkeeping. </p>
<p>For many LULUCF activities-particularly those that involve land-use change
  or widespread adoption of new management systems-measuring the direct human-induced
  effects independently of the background of indirect effects and natural variability
  is difficult or impossible. Where a single or well-defined change in management
  (such as the addition of fertilizer, a switch to conservation tillage, or a
  change in forest harvesting technique) can be identified and there are comparable
  areas nearby where that management is not undertaken, estimating the fraction
  of the total effect from the activity may be possible through the use of control
  plots, models, or predicted baselines. The decisions taken on these aspects
  will be important in affecting measurement and accounting difficulty. </p>
<p>Some agricultural practices (e.g., excessive soil disturbance, nutrient depletion,
  planting varieties with low biomass production, crop residue removal, inadequate
  erosion control practices) have caused reductions in soil organic carbon (SOC)
  estimated at 55 Gt C globally. The application of best-practice crop management-which
  may include conservation tillage, frequent use of cover crops in the rotation
  cycle, agroforestry, judicious use of fertilizers and organic amendments, site-specific
  management, soil water management that involves irrigation and drainage, and
  improved varieties with high biomass production-can recover a substantial part
  of this loss over a period of several decades. In rice agriculture, careful
  water and fertilizer management can lead to increased carbon storage, but calculation
  of the net effect must consider simultaneous changes in CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and N<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions.
  In general, carbon-enhancing cropland management will increase the capacity
  of croplands to feed the world's growing population (<a href="172.htm">Section
  4.4.2</a>). </p>
<p>Forest management can create a significant increase in the standing stock of
  forest biomass and produce positive associated benefits such as improved water
  quality, reduced soil erosion, increased biodiversity, and enhanced rural income.
  Forest management includes all of the practices relating to the regeneration,
  tending, use, and conservation of forests. All aspects that are not included
  as afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation (ARD) activities under Article
  3.3 could be covered by Article 3.4. Examples of the main forestry practices
  likely to alter carbon stocks include forest regeneration, including sub-practices
  such as human-induced natural regeneration, enrichment planting, less grazing
  of savanna grassland, change of tree provenances or species to include short-rotation
  forestry; forest fertilization; pest management; forest fire management; harvest
  quantity and timing; low-impact harvesting; and reducing forest degradation
  (<a href="182.htm">Section 4.4.4</a>). </p>
<p>The carbon impacts of forest management usually can be measured best as a net
  result of the complete suite of practices applied to a given forest area, as
  well as the end-use of the forest products. End use is important for two reasons:
  First, wood products provide a carbon sink, the size of which depends on the
  lifetime of the product; second, greater use of wood allows reduced use of fossil
  fuel (either by using the wood directly for energy production or indirectly
  to replace energy-intensive products such as steel, aluminum, and concrete).
  Including forest products as an activity under Article 3.4 will require decisions
  about how to report credits because the products will come from ARD and non-ARD
  forests (<a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a>), and their original sources will be
  hard to trace once they are in use. Such products are widely traded between
  countries, requiring decisions about where and how to assign credits (<a href="081.htm">Section
  2.4.2.2</a>). </p>
