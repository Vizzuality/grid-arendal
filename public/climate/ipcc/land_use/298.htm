<h3>6.1.1. The IPCC Guidelines </h3>
<p>The IPCC Guidelines consist of three volumes: the Reference Manual, the Workbook,
  and the Reporting Instructions. To analyze their adequacy for reporting under
  the Protocol, there is a need to distinguish between them. The desired principles
  of these inventory guidelines include completeness, comparability, transparency,
  and accuracy (FCCC, 1999). The SBSTA has developed revised UNFCCC reporting
  guidelines for national communications for Annex I Parties (FCCC, 1999, 2000)
  that include GHG inventories. These UNFCCC guidelines are based on the IPCC
  Guidelines but are more detailed. </p>
<p>The Reference Manual provides a comprehensive approach to carbon accounting
  (by covering all of the main land-use change and forestry activities) (see <a href="#figure6-1">Figure
  6-1</a>). The Reference Manual mentions all pools and encourages countries to
  undertake comprehensive accounting of carbon pools affected by anthropogenic
  activities in relation to LUCF. The Guidelines apply the principle of balanced
  accounting for all changes in carbon stocks for all reported pools on a land
  area affected by a given activity; it quantifies sources and removals of GHGs.
  The Guidelines do not differentiate, however, between direct human-induced activities
  and indirect human activities (e.g., atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fertilization or nutrient
  deposition). </p>

	  circle only. Emissions and removals of greenhouse gases can be reported

<p>Using the Reference Manual, it is feasible to estimate national changes in
  aboveground and below-ground biomass, soil, soil surface litter, and harvested
  wood products for all forests, shrublands, grasslands, and agricultural lands
  (see <a href="#figure6-1">Figure 6-1</a>). For countries in which the change
  in stocks of forest products is significant, the Reference Manual recommends
  that the products pool be reported. </p>
<p>To improve accuracy, however, country-specific data and more elaborate methods-such
  as those described in the Reference Manual-may be required. The Guidelines encourage
  the use of national data, but because the Guidelines were designed for use by
  all Parties, a range of default data is provided in the Workbook. Although the
  use of a range of default data does not mean that inventories are not comparable
  (Ravindranath and Sudha, 1999; Houghton and Ramakrishna, 2000), the Guidelines
  state that the use of default data "is unlikely to be considered credible for
  any country which has significant emissions or activities in this area" (IPCC,
  1997, Vol. 3, p. 5.15). In other words, the use of national data is likely to
  increase the accuracy of estimates in GHGs, changes in carbon stocks, and their
  associated activities. This increased accuracy could be important for compliance
  under the Protocol. </p>
<p>The underlying principles of national accounting for GHG emissions and removals
  in the Reference Manual are the same as those applied in the Workbook. The Reference
  Manual contributes to comparability and transparency by virtue of a common,
  simplified approach. It is also helpful when there are limitations of expertise
  and data. </p>
<p>Unlike the Reference Manual, however, the Workbook considers changes in only
  two carbon pools, such as aboveground biomass and carbon in the top 0.3 m of
  the soil (see <a href="#figure6-1">Figure 6-1</a>). The soil carbon method accounts
  for cultivation of soils, land-use change involving soils, and liming of agricultural
  soils. The Workbook does not provide explicit methods for other pools, including
  below-ground biomass, harvested wood products, and deep soil carbon. The treatment
  of wood products in the Workbook differs from that of the Reference Manual.
  The Workbook assumes that stocks of forest products are not increasing significantly
  in most countries. Hence, carbon accounting for wood products is not required,
  although the amount of wood harvested for biofuels is necessary for estimating
  non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> gases and reporting these emissions in the energy sector. The Workbook
  does not account for the effects of forest fires and other disturbances. <br>
  The Reporting Instructions provide a range of definitions for anthropogenic
  activities, a glossary of terms, and tables to report anthropogenic emissions
  and removals of GHGs. The tables are flexible enough to allow for reporting
  of all carbon pools, even if the Guidelines do not provide accounting methods
  and default data. This flexibility in reporting contributes to completeness
  by facilitating the reporting of all carbon pools, though it does not necessarily
  contribute to inventory comparability. </p>
