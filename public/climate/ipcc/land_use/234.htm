<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.11. Replenishing Soil Fertility through Agroforestry
  in Subhumid Tropical Africa </h3>
<p>Leguminous fallows of <i>Sesbania sesban, Tephrosia vogelii, Gliricidia sepium,
  Crotalaria grahamiana,</i> and <i>Cajanus cajan </i>accumulate 0.1-0.2 t N ha<sup>-1</sup>
  in their leaves and roots in 1-2 years. These large amounts of nitrogen are
  uncommon in the organic farming literature; they are equivalent to mineral fertilizer
  input levels in modern agriculture. Upon incorporation of leguminous biomass
  into the soil and subsequent mineralization, these improved fallows provide
  sufficient nitrogen for one to three subsequent maize crops-doubling to quadrupling
  maize yields at the farm scale (Rao <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Kwesiga <i>et al.</i>,
  1999). There are no transport costs involved because all of the nitrogen is
  fixed in the same fields where crops are grown in rotation. </p>
<p>In phosphorus-deficient soils, farmers are beginning to use phosphate rock
  applications of 0.125-0.25 t P ha<sup>-1</sup> as a capital investment, with an expected
  residual effect of 5 years. In addition, biome transfers from hedges of the
  wild sunflower tithonia (<i>Tithonia diversifolia</i>) have shown large yield
  increases of maize and high-value crops such as vegetables in western Kenya
  (Jama <i>et al.</i>, 1999a,b). Tithonia leaves contain high nutrient concentrations
  (3 percent N, 0.3 percent P, 3 percent K) and decompose rapidly in the soil,
  providing a source of soluble carbon that enhances nutrient cycling (Gachengo
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Combinations of tithonia biomass with phosphorus fertilizers
  have been particularly effective (Palm <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Nziguheba <i>et
  al.</i>, 1998; Rao <i>et al.</i>,1998). Farmers incorporate leguminous fallows,
  tithonia, and phosphate rock into their farming systems in a variety of ways.
  Food security has been effectively achieved with these practices. Economic analysis
  shows high net present values for these technologies (Sanchez <i>et al.</i>,
  1997b). </p>
<p>The next step envisioned is planting vegetables that produce high-value products
  as a way to increase small farmer income and reduce poverty. Some farmers have
  reported increases in their net profits from US$91-1665 yr<sup>-1</sup> when they have
  shifted from maize to vegetables in their now-fertile soils (Nyasimi <i>et al.</i>,
  1997). A further step will be the switch to newly domesticated tree crops that
  produce high-value products. These "Cinderella" species-so called because their
  value has been largely overlooked by science although they are appreciated by
  local people-include indigenous fruit trees and other plants that provide medicinal
  products, ornamentals, or high-grade timber (Leakey <i>et al.</i>, 1996). One
  example is <i>Prunus africana</i>, a timber tree that is indigenous to montane
  regions of Africa. A substance extracted from its bark to treat prostate gland-related
  diseases has an annual market value of US$220 million (Cunningham and Mbenkum,
  1993; Simons <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Because these trees are cut and killed in
  indigenous forests and the bark shipped to Europe, <i>Prunus africana </i>is
  now in the CITES Appendix II list of endangered species. With domestication,
  this tree is now being turned into a crop, as researchers select superior ecotypes,
  ways to harvest the bark sustainably, and eventually the development of extraction
  industries located in nearby rural areas (Simons <i>et al.</i>, 1998). </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  These practices are quite new, having been tested in research in the 1990s;
  about 20,000 smallholder farmers currently practice them on roughly 20,000 ha,
  primarily in western Kenya and eastern Zambia. The total potential area could
  become very large, assuming enabling policies in 10 percent of smallholder farms
  in subhumid Africa (8.1 Mha) and 25 Mha in the subhumid tropics of Latin America
  and non-paddy rice areas of Asia, all during the next 20 years. </p>
<p><b>Methods</b><br>
  Changes in time-averaged aboveground and soil carbon can be measured via methods
  described elsewhere in this Special Report. </p>
<p><b>Current Knowledge and Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  Estimates cited are very preliminary. Hard data are now being developed at ICRAF.
  Starting from soils that are 40-60 percent depleted in carbon and have very
  little aboveground biomass, measurement of differences can be made and modeled.
  The largest uncertainty is the area that will benefit from this technology.
</p>
<p><b>Time Scale </b><br>
  A 10-year period is recommended to assess impact on soil carbon stocks. </p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, and Transparency </b><br>
  Direct measurement (time-averaged) of aboveground and soil stocks should be
  used for monitoring. Combining present algorithms for estimating biomass in
  shrubs and small trees, standard soil carbon sampling, and GIS techniques appears
  feasible. The level of additional sequestered carbon can be readily estimated
  by the techniques described above. Assumptions and methodologies associated
  with this practice can be explained clearly to facilitate replication and assessment.
  Scientific methods are open to review and are replicable over time. </p>
<p><b>Permanence</b><br>
  About half of the carbon stored in the soil is likely to have a turnover rate
  of >50 years. Cessation of the activity would lead to a loss of soil carbon,
  which has been estimated to be 40-60 percent in about 20 years.</p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts</b><br>
  Major increases in food security and poverty reduction seem assured. Spillover
  effects could occur in developing rural industries and employment. There would
  be less dependence on nitrogen fertilizer, the manufacture of which entails
  major consumption of fossil fuels (Schlesinger, 1999). Using biologically fixed
  nitrogen would lead to potential savings in N<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions. These practices also
  would reduce dependence on superphosphates, whose manufacture is also highly
  fossil fuel-intensive with high risk of pollution. Increases in soil conservation
  and below-ground biodiversity are likely. Extinction of the endangered tree
  species <i>Prunus africana</i> would be less likely. </p>
