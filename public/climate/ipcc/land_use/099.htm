<h5>2.5.1.1.3. Soil erosion </h5>
<p>Deforestation in hilly areas often leads to decreased infiltration of water
  and consequently higher runoff and increased peak water discharges following
  rainfall events and reduced runoff during dry seasons. Most importantly, it
  results in increased soil erosion, gully and ravine formation, flooding risk,
  and siltation of reservoirs and irrigation schemes. For instance, deforestation
  in the Himalayas has been associated with a doubling in torrent width since
  1990-and a downstream cost of more than US$1 billion (Government of India, 1983).
</p>
<p>Forestation of denuded hilly land will reduce peak runoff; lessen the risk
  of flooding; conserve soils; and prevent severe siltation, gully formation,
  and landslides. In experimental work, up to 500-fold differences in erosion
  rates between forest and cultivated cropland have been recorded (Maass <i>et
  al.</i>, 1988). The presence of forest litter is critically important in facilitating
  infiltration rates and preventing soil/sediment movement by overland flow. Mono-specific
  plantations without an understory, however, may not provide such conditions.
  It is also important to conduct forest establishment activities sensitively
  to minimize negative impacts before a tree cover is established. </p>
<h5><a name="s2-5-1-1-4"></a>2.5.1.1.4. Water quality and water use </h5>
<p>The watershed function of forests has particular public health importance because
  forests often are the primary determinant of water quality and quantity for
  household use in developing countries. In the Philippines, for instance, close
  to 20 million people live in upland watershed areas (Cruz and Zosa-Feranil,
  1988). The importance of forests as watersheds may substantially increase in
  the next few decades because freshwater resources are projected to become increasingly
  scarce, particularly in developing countries (Mountain Agenda, 1997; Liniger
  and Weingartner, 1998). </p>
<p>Watershed areas are important sources of water for irrigation, hydro-electric
  power, and industrial use. Watershed protection is important in maintaining
  the quantity and quality of water supply, as well as flood avoidance. China's
  decision to halt logging in the Yangtze watershed in 1998 following severe flooding
  illustrates the magnitude of these effects. Trees in the Yangtze watershed were
  calculated to be worth at least three times as much for their water regulation
  functions as for their timber value (Smil and Yuchi, 1998, as cited by Abramovitz
  and Mattoon, 1999). </p>
<p>Deforestation and forest degradation associated with high-impact methods of
  logging and mining significantly erodes soils in many countries, with marked
  economic and environmental costs through consequent siltation of rivers, hydropower
  reservoirs, irrigation systems, and coastal ecosystems (Myers, 1997). In the
  Philippines, for instance, an estimated 8.3 Mha of a total land area of 30 Mha
  are severely eroded (EMB, 1990). </p>
<p>Forests generally are expected to use more water (the sum of transpiration
  and evaporation of water intercepted by tree canopies) than crops, grass, or
  natural short vegetation. This effect may be related to increased interception
  loss-especially if tree canopies are wet for a large proportion of the year
  (Calder, 1990)-or, in drier regions, to trees' greater root system, which allows
  water extraction and use during prolonged dry seasons. </p>
<p>Interception losses are greatest from forests that have large leaf areas throughout
  the year. Thus, such losses tend to be greater for evergreen forests than for
  deciduous forests (Hibbert, 1967; Schulze, 1982) and may be expected to be larger
  for fast-growing forests with high rates of carbon storage than for slow-growing
  forests. Consequently, afforestation with fast-growing conifers on non-forest
  land commonly decreases the flow of water from catchments and can cause water
  shortages during droughts (Hibbert, 1967; Swank and Douglass, 1974). Vincent
  (1995), for example, found that establishing high water-demanding species of
  pines to restore degraded Thai watersheds markedly reduced dry-season streamflows
  relative to the original deciduous forests. Although forests lower average flows,
  they may reduce peak flows and increase flows during dry seasons because forested
  lands tend to have better infiltration capacity and a high capacity to retain
  water (Jones and Grant, 1996). Forests also play an important role in improving
  water quality. </p>
<p>In many regions of the world where forests grow above shallow saline water
  tables, decreased water use following deforestation can cause water tables to
  rise, bringing salt to the surface (Morris and Thomson, 1983). In such situations,
  high water use by trees can be of benefit (Schofield, 1992). </p>
<p>In the dry tropics, forest plantations often use more water than short vegetation
  because trees can access water at greater depth and evaporate more intercepted
  water. Newly planted forests can use more water (by transpiration and interception)
  than the annual rainfall, by mining stored water (Greenwood <i>et al.</i>, 1985).
  Extensive afforestation in the dry tropics therefore can have a serious impact
  on supplies of groundwater and river flows. It is less clear, however, whether
  replacing natural forests with plantations, even with exotic species, increases
  water use in the tropics when there is no change in rooting depth or stomatal
  behavior of the tree species. In the dry zone of India, water use by <i>Eucalyptus</i>
  plantations is similar to that of indigenous dry deciduous forest: Both forest
  types essentially utilize all of the annual rainfall (Calder, 1992). </p>
