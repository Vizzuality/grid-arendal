<h4>4.4.7.3. Mine Spoils and Industrially Polluted Sites </h4>
<p>Reclamation of polluted land is especially beneficial because land is brought
  back into production as well as being used to sequester carbon. The downside
  is that reclamation can be very expensive; because of the cost, current practice
  often is to carry out minimum remediation to comply with regulations. Given
  that crop biomass and soil microbial biomass-the means by which all carbon eventually
  becomes sequestered in soil-have been shown to decline with increasing levels
  of heavy metal in soil, carbon sequestration will be less than the potential
  maximum in unpolluted soils unless remediation is complete. </p>
<p>Land that is polluted with heavy metals such as mine-spoil waste or agricultural
  land that has been degraded by sewage sludge can be remediated with plants that
  take up abnormal amounts of the pollutants and concentrate it in harvested biomass.
  Such plants are known as hyperaccumulators (McGrath, 1998). Because the hyperaccumulator
  must be removed along with the heavy metals it contains, the main increase in
  carbon stocks on the site will occur when the soil is brought under normal vegetation
  after initial remediation. Because of the expense and physical limit to the
  amount of contaminant that can be taken up, the use of hyperaccumulators is
  usually restricted to lightly polluted land where the aim of restoration is
  to bring the content of the pollutant below some legal norm. </p>
<p>Unreclaimed lands are more prone to erosion than other land-which emphasizes
  the need for action. Up to 0.63 Mha of strip-mined land in the United States
  may require reclamation (Lal <i>et al.</i>, 1999a). Bennett (1977) reported
  an increase in SOC from 3 to 30 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> during a 4-year study on reclaimed
  mine land where organic manures were applied. Akala and Lal (1999) measured
  soil sequestration of 35-37 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> in 30 cm of soil by reclamation of strip-mined
  land in Ohio, through afforestation and establishment of improved pasture during
  a 25-year period (<a href="199.htm#table4-11">Table 4-11</a>). </p>
<p>Soils that are polluted with organic substances such as fossil fuels are often
  restored by oxidation. This process will lead to an emission of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>. The spill
  already may have been accounted under fossil fuel emissions at some stage in
  the past. The oxidation is almost always microbial; in using the organic compounds
  as a substrate, the microorganisms will add to soil carbon. Thus, accounting
  of carbon associated with the pollution of land with organic substances is fraught
  with complications. </p>
<p>Where land remains polluted or is unattractive for other uses, biofuels may
  be a sensible option-particularly in industrial areas where power stations are
  nearby (Lal and Bruce, 1999; <a href="244.htm">Fact Sheet 4.21</a>). </p>
