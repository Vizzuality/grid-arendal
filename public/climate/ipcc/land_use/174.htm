<h4>4.4.2.2. Conservation Tillage </h4>
<p>Conservation tillage is any tillage and planting system in which 30 percent
  or more of the crop residue remains on the soil surface after planting to reduce
  soil erosion by water. Where soil erosion by wind is the primary concern, conservation
  tillage is any system that maintains at least 1,000 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> of flat, small-grain
  residue equivalent on the surface throughout the critical wind erosion period
  (CTIC, 1998). Conservation tillage can include specific tillage types such as
  no-till, ridge-till, mulch-till, zone-till, and strip-till systems that meet
  the residue requirements (see <a href="226.htm">Fact Sheet 4.3</a>). These tillage
  systems are chosen by farmers to address soil type, crop grown, machinery available,
  and local practice. Although these systems were originally developed to address
  water quality, soil erosion, and agricultural sustainability problems, they
  also lead to higher soil carbon and increased fuel efficiency (<a href="173.htm#table4-5">Table
  4-5</a>) (Lal, 1989, 1997; Blevins and Frye, 1993; Kern and Johnson, 1993; Dalal
  and Mayer, 1996). </p>
<p>No-till methods were initiated in North America in the 1950s; by 1996, the
  estimated area of conservation tillage in the United States was 42 Mha-about
  36 percent of planted cropland (CTIC, 1998). Conservation tillage also has been
  widely adopted in China (Luo, 1991), Brazil (Hebblethwaite and Towery, 1998),
  Argentina (AAPRESID, 1999), the Pacific, and other parts of the humid and subhumid
  tropics (Lal, 1989). Yearly estimates provided by CTIC (1997, 1998, 1999) suggest
  that conservation tillage adoption appears to have reached a plateau because
  the area under conservation tillage is believed to have decreased in the United
  States during the past 2 years. Nevertheless, conservation tillage is now achieving
  widespread adoption around the world. In Argentina, conservation tillage started
  in 1990; the area under this type of cultivation system was 7.3 Mha in 1998-31
  percent of the agricultural lands of the country (AAPRESID, 1999). The area
  under conservation tillage in Brazil has now reached 12 Mha (CTIC, 1998). </p>
<p>The opportunity for carbon emissions reduction and soil carbon sequestration
  in the United States has been estimated at 0.012-0.023 Gt C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (Lal <i>et
  al.</i>, 1998). Globally, conservation tillage can sequester 0.1-1.3 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>
  yr<sup>-1</sup> and could feasibly be adopted on up to 60 percent of arable lands (<a href="173.htm#table4-5">Table
  4-5</a>). These estimates depend on continued use of conservation tillage. Use
  of intensive tillage or moldboard plowing can negate or offset any gains made
  in carbon sequestration (Lindstrom <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>Soil carbon sequestration can be further increased when cover crops are used
  in combination with conservation tillage. Cover cropping shares some of the
  environmental benefits of no-tillage, such as reduced soil erosion and a resulting
  decrease in surface water runoff. The use of cover crops can also aid in reducing
  the use of herbicides (e.g., smother crops; Pan, 1999) and fertilizers (legumes;
  Subak, 1999). The magnitude of carbon sequestration from the use of cover crops
  can be greater than that of conservation tillage (Donigian <i>et al.</i>, 1995;
  Grant <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Paustian <i>et al.</i>, 1997b; Buyanovsky and Wagner,
  1998). </p>
