<h4>3.3.2.3. Options for Reducing Discrepancies between Actual and Reported Carbon
  Stock Changes</h4>
<p>Additional rules could be used to avert some of the type I and type II discrepancies
  described in <a href="128.htm">Section 3.3.2.2</a>, where actual and reported
  stock changes do not match. Two possible ways of doing this are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> By limiting "reforestation lands" that fall under Article 3.3 through the
    use of additional time rules. For example, reforestation could exclude establishment
    of tree cover on land that was non-forest for less than a specified period
    of time (e.g., 10 years) after deforestation or land that was forest at a
    specific point in time (e.g., 1990). If a densely stocked forest with 200
    t C ha<sup>-1</sup> is deforested in 1991, for example, and reforested 5 years later,
    no carbon credits could be claimed in the commitment period. One problem,
    however, is shown by the following example: Assume deforestation of a stand
    with little carbon (e.g., 20 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> in 1991) and reforestation 5 years later
    with vigorously growing trees, with stocks increasing to 50 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> in 2012.
    Even though this activity reduces atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, it would be excluded by
    the use of a time rule. This approach addresses only the type I discrepancy.
  </li>
  <li> By not limiting "reforestation lands" but limiting the amount of credits
    and debits for these lands. There are at least two ways to do this:
    <ul>
      <li> Credit for reforestation in areas deforested after 1990 or 1997, for
	example, could be excluded. With a stand of 200 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> deforested after
	1997, no credits would be possible for subsequent reforestation. In the
	foregoing example of an initial stand at 20 t C and the carbon stocks
	at 50 t C in the commitment period, no credits would be possible. This
	approach addresses only the type I discrepancy. </li>
      <li> Credits for reforestation in areas deforested after 1990 could be limited;
	debits for afforestation and reforestation lands could be limited. This
	approach addresses both type I and type II discrepancies.
	<ul>
	  <li><i> Avoiding the type I discrepancy.</i> For land deforested between
	    1990 and 2007, carbon credits for reforestation could be awarded only
	    for increased carbon stocks above the level of carbon stocks present
	    on the land prior to deforestation (or in 1990) (D-R Rule). This approach
	    would eliminate an incentive to deforest land then reforest it to
	    claim carbon credits during the commitment period, thereby avoiding
	    that type I discrepancy in b2 on the facing page (note that ARD land
	    is assumed to be able to switch from the "deforestation" to the "reforestation"
	    category). This approach entails a moderate increase in data requirements
	    because information about the carbon stock prior to deforestation
	    or in 1990 is needed. The first sentence of Article 3.4 asks for data
	    on carbon stocks in 1990, but it is not clear whether these data have
	    to be geo-referenced; thus, it is not clear whether such data are
	    of use here. </li>
	  <li><i> Avoiding the type II discrepancy.</i> Carbon debits in afforestation
	    and reforestation could be limited to the amount of net credits (i.e.,
	    credits minus debits) received for carbon accumulating on the same
	    land (A/R Debit Rule). This approach would avoid the type II discrepancy
	    in b3 on the facing page, and it does not create additional data needs.
	    The purpose is to cap debits for reforestation activities (that sequestered
	    carbon between 1990 and 2008) followed by harvesting in the first
	    few commitment periods. It ensures that activities that increase carbon
	    stocks in the long term are not counted as debits under Article 3.3.
	    Particularly in the first few commitment periods, there are carbon
	    stocks on afforestation/reforestation lands that would not be credited
	    because they accrue before 2008. Any harvest loss in a commitment
	    period, however, would count to the extent that carbon is lost (see
	    <a href="128.htm">Section 3.3.2.2</a>). In the first commitment period,
	    the A/R Debit Rule would disallow debits because no credits have been
	    assigned previously and because the stocks are most likely higher
	    than they were before the initiation of the afforestation/ reforestation
	    activity. As subsequent commitment periods occur, an increasingly
	    greater share of carbon sequestering on afforestation/ reforestation
	    lands will have been credited, so the allowable debit for harvest
	    also increases. In any event, the net credit (credit minus debit)
	    over time for a unit of land would not be negative. </li>
	  <li><i> The FAO scenario with land-based approach I </i>(stock changes
	    over the full commitment period are accounted). With a harvest in
	    2009 and replanting in 2010, carbon losses from the harvest would
	    be accounted through the 2008-2012 stock change. If the A/R Debit
	    Rule were applied, however, there would be no debit in the first commitment
	    period, even though stocks have decreased. In the FAO scenario with
	    the land-based approach, the debits would be set to zero. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>The amount of land included in the "reforestation" category would not
	  be affected by these two rules. Their main effect is on carbon stock
	  changes, not all of which would necessarily count even if an area is
	  "reforested since 1990." </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The carbon discrepancies in items a1 and c1 could be avoided through the use
  of the Degradation/Aggradation definitional scenario or possibly the Biome scenario.
  The discrepancy in item a2 could be minimized through contiguous commitment
  periods. The problem outlined in b4 could be avoided by defining "reforestation"
  to include planting or regrowth of individual trees in an existing stand. Issue
  d1 could be addressed through the way a forest is defined. </p>
