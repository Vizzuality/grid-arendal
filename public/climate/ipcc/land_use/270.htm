<h2>5.4. Measuring, Accounting, Monitoring, and Verifying GHG Benefits</h2>
<p>Many pilot projects have been developed (see <a href="252.htm#table5-1">Tables
  5-1</a> and <a href="253.htm#table5-2">5-2</a>), and much experience has been
  gained-particularly at the early stages of project implementation. On the basis
  of this experience, this section presents an assessment of the nature of measuring,
  monitoring, accounting, verifying, and reporting GHG benefits. Some key questions
  that guide this section are the following: With what accuracy and precision
  can GHG benefits be measured and monitored in LULUCF projects? Does the accuracy
  and precision of the measuring and monitoring of GHG benefits vary across project
  types? What are the tradeoffs between cost and precision in measuring and monitoring
  GHG benefits? What effects do different accounting methods have on the GHG benefits
  accruing to a project? How long should monitoring, verification, and reporting
  be pursued? How can verification costs be managed? What alternative formats
  are available for reporting project-level GHG benefits? </p>
<h3><a name="s5-4-1"></a>5.4.1. Methods for Quantification of Project GHG Benefits
</h3>
<p>A key aspect of implementing LULUCF projects to mitigate GHG emissions and
  trading is accurate and precise quantification of project-level GHG benefits.
  In LULUCF projects, the main focus is on carbon (as CO<span class="subscript">2</span>) benefits, but other
  gases should be included as appropriate. <a href="#table5-6">Table 5-6</a> presents
  typical examples of generic projects, some of which could include carbon only
  or both carbon and non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> GHG benefits (see also <a href="157.htm">Chapter
  4</a>). For instance, a project designed to stop deforestation typically would
  include carbon benefits, but it could also include nitrous oxide and carbon
  monoxide benefits that would result from stopping the burning of biomass during
  forest clearing. Soil and agricultural projects could include non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> GHGs such
  as nitrous oxide and methane as well. Whereas carbon benefits are generally
  measured as changes in carbon stocks, however, non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> GHGs are measured as
  fluxes, and the methods are less well developed (See <a href="014.htm">Chapters
  1</a> and <a href="038.htm">2</a>; Houghton <i>et al.</i>, 1997); thus, the
  following discussion focuses on carbon (as CO<span class="subscript">2</span>). Moreover, the example projects
  in <a href="#table5-6">Table 5-6</a> could vary in size and distribution; they
  could be contiguous, extending over hundreds to thousands of hectares, or a
  "bundle" of small scattered landowners each of whose total area could be hundreds
  of hectares. </p>

<p>This section discusses which pools need to be quantified, how they can be accurately
  measured to a known level of precision, and techniques to monitor the carbon
  benefits over the length of the project. The initial carbon inventory is distinguished
  from subsequent monitoring: In the initial inventory, the relevant major pools
  or fluxes are quantified; in subsequent monitoring, only selected pools or fluxes
  may be measured, and even indicators could be used, depending upon the type
  of LULUCF project. </p>
