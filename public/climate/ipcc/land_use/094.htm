<h3>2.4.6. Preparations for and Operational Strategy during the First Commitment
  Period </h3>
<p>Although methods exist for measuring stocks of carbon and fluxes of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and
  non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> GHGs, implementation of these methods will require investments in human
  resources, technology, and infrastructure. First-time forest inventories, for
  example, will require calibration and validation of allometric relationships
  between merchantable wood volumes and total carbon in the ecosystem, including
  roots, small trees, and ground cover. Soil carbon models must be developed and
  tested against local or regional conditions. For remote-sensing data in particular,
  implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, even for the first commitment period,
  will require making observational systems operational, establishing international
  policies for sharing data, and building human resources and infrastructure.
</p>
<p>Remote-sensing methods (<a href="090.htm">Section 2.4.4</a>) currently are
  largely confined to the scientific community. In only a few cases is remote-sensing
  information routinely being used by operational agencies to classify vegetation,
  to estimate rates and extent of forest clearing and regrowth, or to detect fires.
  Because methods do exist for many of the measurement tasks, however, a particular
  challenge that Parties may wish to consider is the development of an operational
  use of satellite data. Skole <i>et al. </i>(1997) provided an early view of
  what some of the requirements of such an operational system might be, from a
  technical and organizational perspective. Several critical challenges must be
  met, however, if such systems are to be routinely used in the context of the
  Kyoto Protocol. </p>
<p>Institutional and national commitments will be necessary to ensure that the
  basic means of making remote-sensing observations do, in fact, exist. The satellite
  systems and capabilities described in <a href="090.htm">Section 2.4.4</a> currently
  are treated as research missions. The transition to operational status-balancing
  the need for continuous, comparable observations with the need to allow the
  technology to evolve-has not occurred for land observations to the same degree
  that it has occurred for basic meteorological measurements. </p>
<p>Provisions for archiving spatial data are also required. All of the methods
  and accounting systems described in this Special Report require maintenance
  of a historical record of what has occurred. If remote sensing is used to help
  in those determinations, access to historical data will certainly be necessary.
  In addition, the scientific community's ability to extract information from
  the data set should be expected to continue to evolve as algorithms themselves
  evolve. Maintenance of a data archive would ensure that nations are able to
  examine their records again as their understanding of their own situations continues
  to evolve. <br>
  Human resources and infrastructure required to exploit remotely sensed data
  will need to be established and made available to Parties. Although there has
  been substantial progress over the past decade in making new remotely sensed
  data and GIS tools for analysis available, as well as in the development of
  analytical methods and technologies, substantial hurdles still exist in terms
  of human capital. Education and training programs would be required to ensure
  that all Parties have sufficient access to expertise and methods for using these
  data sets. </p>
<p>Finally, the enormous capital expenses and consistent operational expenses
  are large enough that only a handful of nations may be expected to bear them.
  If other Parties also are to benefit from the observations, policies and procedures
  for sharing the data and information derived from them will have to be agreed
  on. Again, the question of how satellite data will be used for primary reporting
  and for verification must be addressed. </p>
