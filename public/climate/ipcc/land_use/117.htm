<h2>Implications of Definitional Scenarios for Data Needs and Data Acquisition</h2>
<p>The definitions chosen for forest and ARD, as well as the accounting approach
  adopted (activity-based versus land-based) will have an impact on the data required
  for implementation of Article 3.3. Activity-based accounting will require a
  system for accurate detection and reporting of activities, some of which can
  be reasonably met using remote-sensing data. A land-based approach lends itself
  better to the use of existing forest inventory systems. <a href="038.htm">Chapter
  2</a> discusses methods for collecting data on carbon stock changes, but decisions
  on Article 3.3 will determine which pools should be included in stock change
  reporting. Stock changes in some pools are substantially more measurable and
  verifiable (e.g., aboveground biomass); stock changes in other pools involve
  significantly higher costs or modeling (e.g., dead organic matter, wood products).
</p>
<p>In most Annex I countries, methods (e.g., measurement techniques, statistical
  tools, models, and activity reporting systems) are available for identifying
  and measuring carbon stock changes associated with ARD lands that are based
  on accepted principles of forest inventory, statistics, soil sampling, and ecological
  surveys. These methods vary in accuracy, precision, cost, periodicity of survey,
  and scale of application. <br>
  Although most Annex I countries have the elements required for the routine measurement
  of carbon stocks, only a few have a comprehensive operational national system
  based on continuous forest inventories, remote sensing, or other methods. Some
  adaptations of current measurement systems might be necessary to implement Article
  3.3. Such comprehensive systems are usually not available in non-Annex I countries.
</p>
<p>Methods of measuring changes in carbon stocks in aboveground biomass over a
  5-year commitment period are sensitive enough to serve the requirements of the
  Protocol. Sensitive methods for measuring below-ground carbon stocks also exist,
  but changes in soil carbon stocks over a 5-year commitment period may be difficult
  to measure in some soils because changes in soil carbon stocks on ARD land may
  be small compared to background levels and because of high levels of spatial
  variability. This challenge can be addressed by either taking a large number
  of samples within a single commitment period-possibly at significant cost and
  still limited accuracy-or by measuring and accounting over multiple commitment
  periods. Changes can also be assessed through appropriate comprehensive ecosystem
  models, but site-specific verification may be difficult.</p>
