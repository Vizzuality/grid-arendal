<h4>1.3.2.3. Carbon Dioxide Fertilization </h4>
<p>The impact of the slow progressive rise in the atmospheric concentration of
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> on the carbon sequestration capacity of stands of trees and other vegetation
  is difficult to measure. Some indications can be obtained, however, from the
  large number of recent experimental programs in which young trees have been
  exposed to double the current atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration over periods of
  up to 6 years. When rooted in the ground with unconfined root systems in open-top
  chambers, open-side chambers, closed chambers, and Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment
  (FACE) rings, there is similar enhancement (up to 60 percent) of aboveground
  and below-ground growth rate (NPP) and carbon accumulation (Saxe <i>et al.</i>,
  1998; Norby <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Trees grown in double the atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  concentration translocate appreciably more carbon below ground than do trees
  grown in ambient CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration. For example, 4-year-old birch trees grown
  in elevated CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration translocated three times as much carbon below
  ground as trees grown in ambient CO<span class="subscript">2</span> (Wang <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Much of this
  carbon ends up as fine roots, microbes, and mycorrhizae that contribute detritus
  to the pool of soil organic matter (Rey and Jarvis, 1997). </p>
<p>Meta-analysis of the results from several experiments in Europe on deciduous
  and coniferous species gave an average increase of 54 percent (Medlyn <i>et
  al.</i>, 2000), with no significant differences between the functional types
  or between stressed and unstressed groups of experiments. Similar results were
  found through meta-analysis of similar experiments in the United States (Curtis
  and Wang, 1998; Peterson <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Moderate lack of nutrients and
  water reduces growth but has little effect on the relative impact of the increase
  in CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration. Generally, the increase in CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration speeds up
  development, so trees get bigger more quickly but otherwise remain very similar
  in most respects to trees of the same size growing in current ambient conditions.
  The rate of photosynthetic uptake of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> is almost always higher in air with
  elevated CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration than in ambient air. Meta-analysis of data from experiments
  largely on temperate trees has shown that the key enzymatic parameters that
  define the capacity for photosynthetic CO<span class="subscript">2</span> as a result of growth in elevated
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> uptake are down-regulated on average by no more than 12 percent, in approximate
  proportion to the reduction in foliar nitrogen concentration; stomatal conductance
  is down-regulated by approximately 15 percent, with consequent increased efficiency
  of use of both nitrogen and water (Curtis, 1996; Curtis and Wang, 1998; Peterson
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Medlyn <i>et al.</i>, 2000). </p>
<p>Most experimental studies to date have been limited to exposure of young trees
  to elevated CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentrations for a few years of treatment. A key question
  that is yet to be resolved is the extent to which the responses of key parameters
  to increased CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration will change when a stand of young trees reaches
  canopy closure. It is uncertain whether the primary result of the increased
  rate of growth is that maturity is approached more quickly or whether more carbon
  will also be finally stored in the trees and soil as a forest stand matures.
  Some experimental and observational studies suggest that the initial positive
  effects of elevated CO<span class="subscript">2</span> on growth rate cited above are greatly reduced or disappear
  as a stand matures but that more carbon does remain sequestered (e.g., Hättenschwiler
  <i>et al.</i>, 1997). These questions may be partially resolved through the
  long-term FACE experiments currently in progress on young stands (e.g., Ellsworth,
  1999), but at present the long-term effect of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fertilization on carbon sequestration
  by forest stands remains an open question. </p>
<p>The phenological development and growth rate of agricultural crops and grassland
  are accelerated in elevated atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration. This leads to increases
  in crop productivity and increases in harvestable yield in some cases (e.g.,
  Tubiello <i>et al.</i>, 1999), though not in others (Wechsung <i>et al.</i>,
  1999). Tropical grasslands have very high NPP, especially below ground (House
  and Hall, 2000), but whether the amount of carbon stored in the soil is increasing
  is uncertain. </p>
