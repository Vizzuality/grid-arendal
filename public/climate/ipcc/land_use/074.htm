<h4>2.3.6.3. Equivalence Time and Ton-Years </h4>
<p>An alternative approach is to compare activities that sequester (or release)
  carbon for different lengths of time by using an accounting convention or equivalency
  factor. The basic policy question that must be answered for any such system
  is how long carbon must be sequestered to be considered equivalent to "permanent"
  emission avoidance. (Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol states that accounting
  should be based on verifiable changes in stocks in each commitment period-apparently
  precluding an equivalency factor approach). Several authors have analyzed the
  benefits of sequestration projects being accounted for on a ton-year basis rather
  than by requiring "permanent" sequestration. Ton-year accounting (Fearnside,
  1995, 1997; Moura-Costa, 1996; Bird, 1997; Chomitz, 1998a; Dobes <i>et al.</i>,
  1998; Tipper and de Jong, 1998; Moura-Costa and Wilson, 1999) would allow comparisons
  between avoided fossil fuel emissions and sequestration activities as well as
  among sequestration activities of different duration. Under a ton-year system,
  credit would be given for the number of tons of carbon held out of the atmosphere
  for a given number of years. A ton-year accounting system would provide a basis
  for temporary sequestration or delayed deforestation to be credited; the mitigation
  benefit from a given patch of land is greater the longer the carbon remains
  in place-which would be reflected in the credit earned. </p>
<p>As long as the policy time horizon is finite or a non-zero discount rate is
  applied to determine the present value of future emissions/ removals, even short-term
  sequestration will have some value. The explanation of this proposition is made
  clearer by considering the converse case: emission of 1 t CO<span class="subscript">2</span> followed 20 years
  later by removal of 1 t CO<span class="subscript">2</span>. Although the net emission over the entire period
  is zero, there clearly has been an effect on the atmosphere. A ton-year equivalency
  factor can be used to determine the relative climate effect of different patterns
  of emissions and removals over time. For a given pattern, this factor will be
  a function of the time horizon and discount rate selected. </p>
<p>Alternative methodologies have been proposed to generate this equivalence time
  parameter. Tipper and de Jong (1998), for example, base their calculations on
  the difference between current atmospheric concentrations and the pre-industrial
  "equilibrium" concentration of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> to derive a carbon storage period (Te) of
  42-50 years following initial sequestration. Similar ranges have been proposed
  by Bird (1997; Te = 60 years) and Chomitz (1998b; Te = 50 years). Dobes et al.
  (1998) analyzed the effect of storage as a delay in emissions and calculated
  Te = 150 years. </p>
<p>A similar problem has been addressed through the use of GWPs to compare emissions
  of GHGs that have different residence times in the atmosphere (as well as different
  radiative forcing per molecule). Although this concept has limitations (IPCC,
  1996; Smith and Wigley, 2000), it has been adopted for use in the Kyoto Protocol
  to account for the total emissions of covered GHGs on a CO<span class="subscript">2</span>-equivalent basis.
  Absolute Global Warming Potentials (AGWPs) are calculated by integrating the
  total radiative forcing of an emissions pulse over a 100-year time horizon with
  no discounting. Relative GWPs are the ratio of this integral for a given GHG
  to that of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, which serves as the reference gas. This approach could be applied
  to compare carbon sequestration projects of different lengths, although there
  is no requirement in the Protocol to use the same conventions in this context.
  The reference is "permanent" (more than 100 years) removal (or emission) of
  1 t CO<span class="subscript">2</span>. Based on the carbon cycle model used to calculate GWPs in the Second
  Assessment Report (SAR) (Joos <i>et al.</i>, 1996), this approach results in
  a reduction (or increase, in the case of an emission) in the cumulative CO<span class="subscript">2</span>-C
  loading of 46 ton-years relative to a reference scenario with no emission or
  uptake.<a href="fn3.htm#4" onClick="showFootnote(3,4); return false;"><sup>4</sup></a> </p>

	  the unperturbed state, based on a reduced form of the carbon cycle model
	  used to calculate Global Warming Potentials in the Second Assessment
	  Report (Joos <i>et al.</i>, 1996). The net effect on the atmosphere

<p>A carbon sequestration project with a duration of 46 years, for example, can
  be analyzed as a removal of 1 t CO<span class="subscript">2</span> in year zero followed by emission of 1 t
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> in year 46. As <a href="#figure2-5">Figure 2-5</a> illustrates, the net
  reduction in atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> burden from this project is the difference between
  the integrated effect of these two events (over a 100-year time horizon, for
  consistency with the GWP approach). The result is a reduction in atmospheric
  burden of 17 ton-years (the difference between the integrals of the two curves
  within the 100-year time horizon: 46 ton-years - 29 ton-years), or 37 percent
  of the effect of a "permanent" removal (or avoided emission). Note that the
  relative value of such a project would be higher with a shorter time horizon
  (100 percent for a time horizon of less than 46 years) and lower for a longer
  time horizon (6 percent for a time horizon of 500 years) (Fearnside <i>et al.</i>,
  1999). </p>

<p>The foregoing calculations consider the difference between the mitigation and
  baseline scenarios by comparing the integrals of the atmospheric load of carbon
  over the time horizon. This approach focuses on carbon in the atmosphere for
  computing the benefits of LULUCF mitigation projects-as contrasted to some analyses
  that focus attention on carbon in trees (e.g., Moura-Costa and Wilson, 1999).
  The distinction between carbon in trees and carbon in the atmosphere is important
  because carbon in the atmosphere is subject to removal through natural processes
  that transfer it to sinks such as oceans and the biosphere, whereas carbon in
  trees is assumed to remain fixed. If carbon release is delayed because it is
  held in trees, the benefit is represented in this approach by the area of the
  tail of the second curve that is pushed beyond the end of the time horizon as
  a result of the delay in emissions (see <a href="#figure2-6">Figure 2-6</a>)-not
  by the larger area that would be described by a rectangle representing carbon
  stock in plantation biomass over the life of a mitigation project. In the approach
  proposed by Moura-Costa and Wilson (1999), an "equivalence time" is calculated
  as the point at which the area of the rectangle representing biomass carbon
  is equal to the area under the atmospheric carbon decay curve over the 100-year
  time horizon. </p>
<p>If the ton-year approach is adopted, incremental credit can be awarded for
  each year that carbon stocks remain sequestered. The cumulative award of credit
  would equal the credit from a "permanent" emission reduction of the same magnitude
  if the stocks remained intact for 100 years. If the stocks were released at
  any time prior to the 100-year time horizon, only the appropriate amount of
  partial credit would have been awarded (see <a href="#table2-6">Table 2-6</a>).

<p>Ton-year accounting requires some data that are not required by systems that
  are based solely on "snapshots" of carbon stocks at the beginning and end of
  each commitment period. However, for most LULUCF activities, such as plantation
  silviculture, the carbon stocks in intermediate years can be inferred from the
  snapshot data, supplemented with records of harvest and planting dates that
  should be readily available. </p>
