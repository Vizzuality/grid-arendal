<h4>3.3.2.2. Discrepancies between Actual and Reported Stock Changes </h4>
<p>Although afforestation and reforestation ordinarily result in net carbon sequestration
  and deforestation results in net carbon emissions, these outcomes may not always
  be true in reporting under Article 3.3, depending on the definitions and carbon
  accounting approaches adopted. Certain definitions of ARD could result in Parties
  receiving "credits" (i.e., additions to their assigned amounts) for activities
  that cumulatively result in an increase or no change in atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> (type
  I discrepancy). Conversely, certain definitions could result in Parties receiving
  debits (i.e., deductions from their assigned amounts) for activities that result
  in reductions or no change in atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> (type II discrepancy). This section
  analyzes some of these possibilities. The discussion below is organized around
  the terms "forest," "reforestation," "degradation," and "deforestation": </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li><i> Forest.</i> If forests are defined on the basis of a threshold for canopy
    cover or biomass density, a certain number (e.g., 10 percent canopy cover
    of trees) will be the cut-off point between forest and non-forest land. Two
    type I discrepancies suggest themselves:
    <ol type="1">
      <li> Forests with canopy cover that is greater than the threshold value
	could be degraded to the defined canopy cover limit, releasing a large
	amount of carbon to the atmosphere or transferring it to non-forest carbon
	pools, without carbon debit. Subsequent deforestation of the 10 percent
	canopy cover forests could result in an accounting of carbon loss that
	matches the carbon in the 10 percent canopy forest rather than in the
	forest that existed previously. Only the Degradation/ Aggradation and
	Biome definitional scenarios could avoid this problem-and only if the
	maximum crown cover or carbon content of vegetation at maturity is reduced.
	Otherwise, such degradation effects could be covered only by Article 3.4.
      </li>
      <li> Thinning or clear-cut harvesting operations on afforestation/reforestation
	lands could occur just before the first commitment period and between
	subsequent commitment periods to maximize carbon increments over the commitment
	period. This effect could be minimized through specification of contiguous
	commitment periods. Forest managers, however, are unlikely to base their
	management decisions mainly on considerations of carbon credits rather
	than silvicultural needs and timber market demands. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><i>Reforestation</i>
    <ol>
      <li> <i>FAO scenario.</i> If a stand is cleared and reforested between 1990
	and 2008, carbon credits could be claimed even if the carbon stocks in
	the landscape are not increasing (type I discrepancy) (see <a href="144.htm">Section
	3.5.2</a>). For a stand that is cleared and reforested between 2008 and
	2012, we have to separate the three accounting options described in Section
	3.2.2:
	<ul>
	  <li> <i>Activity-based approach.</i> Carbon stock losses at the time
	    of harvest are not accounted, nor are subsequent emissions from decaying
	    dead organic matter. Only the accumulation of carbon in the new stand
	    and in new dead organic matter is accounted because it results from
	    the reforestation activity. Carbon credits could be claimed even if
	    the carbon stocks in the landscape are not increasing (type I discrepancy)
	    (see <a href="144.htm">Section 3.5.2</a> for results on the landscape
	    level).</li>
	  <li><i> Land-based approach I.</i> The stock change over the full commitment
	    period is measured, including stock losses during harvest, as well
	    as delayed emissions from dead organic matter. The consequence is
	    a large debit (except where rotation periods are below 20 years) (see
	    <a href="144.htm">Section 3.5.2</a>). This is a type II discrepancy.
	  </li>
	  <li><i> Land-based approach II.</i> The carbon stock change between
	    the beginning of the activity and the end of the commitment period
	    is measured, including the decaying slash resulting from the harvest.
	    In the short term, debits may be reported because of the effects of
	    decaying slash (type II discrepancy). In the long term, credits will
	    accrue even if stocks on the landscape are not increasing (type I
	    discrepancy) (see <a href="144.htm">Section 3.5.2</a> for results
	    on the landscape level). </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li><i> All definitional scenarios.</i> Assume a case where land is deforested
	and used for agriculture before 2008, then reforested. Credits could be
	claimed even though carbon stocks in the commitment period are likely
	to be lower than in 1990 (type I discrepancy). </li>
      <li> In the case of afforestation or reforestation between 1990 and 2008,
	carbon stocks can decrease in a commitment period-for example, because
	of harvesting or thinning. Debits would be assigned even though the afforestation
	or reforestation activity reduces atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> in the long run and
	carbon stocks in the commitment period likely exceed those in 1990 (type
	II discrepancy). </li>
      <li><i> FAO scenario.</i> There can be an unbalanced treatment of different
	harvesting methods because partial cutting techniques do not result in
	reforestation under this scenario. This imbalance could result in an incentive
	to favor clear-cutting over other harvesting methods, possibly working
	against other considerations related to sustainable forest management.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><i>Degradation</i> <br>
    In all scenarios except Land Cover and FAO (in combination with land-based
    approach I), forestry activities could focus on high carbon-density forests
    because they can be harvested without carbon penalty as long as another forest
    replaces them. No carbon has to be accounted when forests of high carbon density
    are logged (and their large amounts of carbon released) and replaced by plantings
    with low carbon stocks (type I discrepancy). </li>
  <li><i>Deforestation</i><br>
    <i>FAO and IPCC scenarios.</i> The forest definition contains a list of exceptions
    for lands that are forests without reaching the crown-cover threshold at maturity.
    For example, the determination of whether a new road results in deforestation
    would be based on the use of the road. If it is used to access forest stands
    for logging, it would not be considered deforestation, whereas a road that
    is used for transportation (such as a new highway) would be. For the purpose
    of determining long-term impacts on the atmosphere, this distinction is arbitrary.
  </li>
