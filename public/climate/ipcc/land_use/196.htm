<h3>4.4.6. Wetlands Management </h3>
<p>Wetlands are defined as areas of land that are inundated for at least part
  of the year, leading to physico-chemical and biological conditions characteristic
  of shallowly flooded systems (IPCC, 1996b). Anaerobic conditions associated
  with inundation slow decomposition rates and allow accumulation of large stores
  of carbon over long time scales, even in systems of relatively low productivity.
  Although wetlands occupy only 4-6 percent of the Earth's land area (~0.53-0.57
  Gha) (Matthews and Fung, 1987; Aselmann and Crutzen, 1989), they store an estimated
  20-25 percent of the world's soil carbon (350-535 Gt C) (Gorham, 1995). The
  rates of carbon accumulation in peats (organic soils commonly associated with
  wetlands) vary with age (Armentano and Menges, 1986; Tolonen and Turunen, 1996)
  but eventually reach equilibrium when inputs equal losses (slow decomposition
  rates applied to very large carbon stores) (Clymo, 1984). Most of the wetland
  area and associated carbon storage is in peatlands in temperate and boreal regions;
  roughly 10-30 percent is in the tropics. </p>
<p>Decomposition under anaerobic conditions produces methane-a greenhouse gas.
  Wetlands are the largest natural source of methane to the atmosphere, emitting
  roughly 0.11 Gt CH<span class="subscript">4</span> yr<sup>-1</sup> of the total of 0.50-0.54 Gt CH<span class="subscript">4</span> yr<sup>-1</sup> (Fung <i>et al.</i>,
  1991). Using a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 21 for CH<span class="subscript">4</span>, emissions of ~1.7
  g CH<span class="subscript">4</span> m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> will offset the CO<span class="subscript">2</span> sink equivalent to a 0.1 Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> accumulation
  of organic matter. The range of CH<span class="subscript">4</span> emissions from freshwater wetlands ranges
  from 7 to 40 g CH<span class="subscript">4</span> m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>; carbon accumulation rates range from small losses
  up to 0.35 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> storage (Gorham, 1995; Tolonen and Turunen, 1996; Bergkamp
  and Orlando, 1999). Most freshwater wetlands therefore are small net GHG sources
  to the atmosphere. Two exceptions are forested upland peats, which may actually
  consume small amounts of methane (Moosavi and Crill, 1997) and coastal wetlands,
  which do not produce significant amounts of methane (e.g., Magenheimer <i>et
  al.</i>, 1996). Wetlands appear to be relatively small sources of N<span class="subscript">2</span>O to the
  atmosphere, except when they are converted for agricultural use. Although methane
  emissions from wetlands are now reported as part of a nation's GHG emissions,
  we compare methane and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions equivalently here to demonstrate the impact
  of various wetland activities on atmospheric GHGs. <br>
  Wetlands are vulnerable to future climate change (see IPCC, 1996b, Chapter 6).
  Increased decomposition rates in warmer temperatures-if associated with drier
  conditions-may lead to large carbon losses to the atmosphere, particularly from
  northern peatlands (Gorham, 1995); warmer temperatures may also lead to enhanced
  CH<span class="subscript">4</span> emissions. Changes in regional hydrology
  caused by precipitation changes may cause loss or new growth of wetlands locally.
  Changes in permafrost extent and depth will alter the extent and dynamics of
  tundra wetlands. Sea-level rise will impact coastal wetland areas. </p>
<p>Wetlands management takes several forms: conversion to agriculture, drainage
  for forestry or agriculture, conversion for urban/industrial land uses, creation
  through construction of dams (energy uses), direct harvesting, and wetlands
  reconstruction. </p>
<p><a href="#table4-10">Table 4-10</a> lists major practices that impact wetlands,
  along with associated processes affecting carbon storage and methane emission.
  Most practices affect CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions in opposite ways. Data for the area
  of total wetlands, the area of human-impacted wetlands, and effects on GHGs
  are largely unknown for many regions. Hence, <a href="#table4-10">Table 4-10</a>
  gives qualitative rather than quantitative estimates for the net GHG effect
  of different management practices. Drainage of wetlands is associated with potentially
  large carbon losses as organic matter that has accumulated slowly over centuries
  to millennia is oxidized. Methane emissions from drained wetlands will be reduced
  (drained systems may even consume methane), offsetting some of the net GHG emission.
  For wetlands that do not emit significant methane (coastal wetlands), carbon
  stock changes will dominate. For many freshwater wetlands, methane emissions
  roughly balance the effect of carbon stock changes in CO<span class="subscript">2</span>-equivalent emissions.

<p>To calculate the effect of wetlands activities on GHG emissions, information
  on areal conversion by wetland type is needed, along with net changes in GHG
  emissions. The area of global wetland converted for human use is poorly known,
  and estimates are mostly unavailable at the country level. Global estimates
  range from 6 percent (Armentano and Menges, 1986) to 50 percent (Moser <i>et
  al.</i>, 1996), with most conversion in temperate and tropical regions. </p>
<p>Wetland extent and duration of inundation are observable through remote sensing
  (e.g., Johnston and Barson, 1993). Carbon accumulation and methane emission
  rates can potentially be modeled, although these models are still in developmental
  stages for most wetland types. Validation of changes in carbon stores through
  field sampling is challenging because of the large size of the pools (e.g.,
  the depth of many peaty soils) and the difficulty of physical access. Methane
  measurements on a wide scale would be difficult and expensive. </p>
<p>Several non-GHG impacts are associated with land practices that affect wetlands.
  Wetlands are specialized habitats that have distinct and often valuable flora
  and fauna; their loss is a biodiversity issue. Wetlands sequester many pollutants
  at the local level; in several countries, wetlands are constructed to treat
  wastewater. They act as a buffer for rapid changes in hydrology, and removal
  of wetlands can lead to increased flooding in some areas. Harvested organic
  matter from organic soils and peatlands is used as a fuel in some regions. Several
  international negotiations pertain to these aspects of wetlands-in particular,
  the Convention on Wetlands, the Convention on Biodiversity, and the Marine and
  Coastal Work Program (Bergkamp and Orlando, 1999). </p>
