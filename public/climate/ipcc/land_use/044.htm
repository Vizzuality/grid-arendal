<h2>2.2. Definitions of Terms Used in the Convention and Protocol </h2>
<h3><a name="s2-2-1"></a>2.2.1. Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry </h3>
<p>The phrase "land-use change and forestry" was used in discussions leading up
  to the Protocol as the name for a "sector/source category." It is also used
  as the title of a chapter in the IPCC Guidelines. The Guidelines refer to sources
  and sinks associated with: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>".greenhouse gas emissions from human activities which </p>
  <ol>
    <li> Change the way land is used (e.g., clearing of forests for agricultural
      use, including open burning of cleared biomass), or </li>
    <li>Affect the amount of biomass in existing biomass stocks (e.g., forests,
      village trees, woody savannas, etc.)." </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The Guidelines conclude that: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"the most important land-use changes that result in CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions and removals
    are </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Changes in forest and other woody biomass stocks- The most important effects
      of human interactions with existing forests are considered in a single broad
      category, which includes commercial management, harvest of industrial roundwood
      (logs) and fuelwood, production and use of wood commodities, and establishment
      and operation of forest plantations, as well as planting of trees in urban,
      village, and other non-forest locations. </li>
    <li>Forest and grassland conversion-The conversion of forests and grasslands
      to pasture, cropland, or other managed uses can significantly change carbon
      stored in vegetation and soil. </li>
    <li>Abandonment of croplands, pastures, plantation forests, or other managed
      lands that regrow into their prior natural grassland or forest conditions.
    </li>
    <li>Changes in soil carbon." <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some confusion arises from the use of the term "land-use change" in the IPCC
  Guidelines because many of the stock changes (especially in forest pools) are
  not associated with a change in land use. For example, "commercial management
  [or] harvest of industrial roundwood (logs) and fuelwood" is a land use but
  not a land-use change. Similarly, changes in cropping practice, such as minimum
  tillage that reduces soil disturbances and consequential carbon loss, are described
  in the IPCC Guidelines even though they are not associated with changes in land
  use. </p>
<p>The Protocol uses the phrase "land-use change and forestry" on three occasions:
  in Articles 3.3, 3.4, and 3.7. (Article 12 does not explicitly mention this
  phrase, but we make no presumption about decisions by the Parties in relation
  to this Article.) </p>
<p>Article 3.3 refers to "greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by
  sinks resulting from direct human-induced land-use change and forestry activities,
  limited to afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation since 1990." Decision
  9/CP.4 at COP4 clarified that the domain of the clause is restricted to the
  specified forestry activities: "The adjustment to a Party's assigned amount
  shall be equal to verifiable changes in carbon stocks during the period 2008
  to 2012 resulting from direct human-induced activities of afforestation, reforestation,
  and deforestation since 1 January 1990." There is no consensus on definitions
  of ARD activities in the technical literature; some of the more important issues
  associated with their definition are discussed below and elaborated in <a href="112.htm">Chapter
  3</a>. </p>
<p>Article 3.4 refers to "additional human-induced activities related to changes
  in greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the agricultural
  soils and the land-use change and forestry categories." This clause is less
  restrictive; it requires definitions of agricultural soils, land use (to define
  land-use change), and forestry. These terms are also discussed below and again
  in more detail in <a href="157.htm">Chapter 4</a>. </p>
<p>The phrase "land-use change and forestry" appears again in Article 3.7 in the
  context of whether this sector was a net source of GHG emissions in 1990. Later
  in the clause, the phrase "land-use change" is used without mention of "forestry."
</p>
<p>The title of this Special Report incorporates the term "land use" as well as
  "land-use change" [COP4 decision 9/CP.4 and Subsidiary Body for Scientific and
  Technological Advice (SBSTA8)]. This chapter and subsequent chapters deal with
  situations in which significant changes in carbon stocks might occur, regardless
  of whether they are associated with changes in land use. Wherever possible,
  however, we attempt to identify whether an activity is associated with an actual
  land-use change. </p>
