<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.3. Conservation Tillage </h3>
<p>Conservation tillage is a generic term that includes a wide range of tillage
  practices, including chisel plow, ridge till, strip till, mulch till, and no
  till (CTIC, 1998). For more detail, see <a href="174.htm">Section 4.4.2.2</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b><br>
  The practice came into use during the 1950s for row crop production on erodible
  land in the midwestern United States. In 1998, about 37 percent of the row crops
  grown in the United States were sown with a conservation tillage system (CTIC,
  1998). The upland area managed with conservation tillage is 12 Mha in Brazil
  and 4 Mha in Argentina. The majority of the area in conservation tillage in
  Brazil and Argentina is continuous no-till; this is not the case in the United
  States. There is potential for expansion of cropland under conservation tillage
  in Asia, Australia, Africa, and Europe. </p>
<p><b>Current Knowledge and Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  The rate of SOC sequestration by conversion from conventional to conservation
  tillage in North America has been found to differ among soils, cropping systems,
  and ecoregions and may range from 0.05 to 1.3 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, with a mean of
  0.3 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. The rate of sequestration for principal soils and ecoregions
  must be established through monitoring of carbon dynamics on long-term experiments
  in different ecoregions. The net rate of sequestration must be assessed by taking
  into consideration the carbon used in herbicide production and application,
  which differs among tillage systems. The amount of carbon residue returned to
  the soil is an important factor because such residue is often removed for use
  as fodder and fuel. </p>
<p><b>Methods</b><br>
  Rates of SOC sequestration for specific types of conservation tillage can be
  established for predominant cropping systems on the basis of long-term benchmark
  experiments, on-site sampling, and modeling. The rates differ depending on the
  amount of soil disturbance and the quality and quantity of crop residue returned
  (Lal, 1997; Paustian <i>et al.</i>, 1997a). The rate of carbon sequestration
  can be quantified on the basis of ground cover, residue returned, and cropping
  systems determined through remotely sensed data. Scaling from local to regional
  and national levels can be done by using a combination of soil maps, cropping
  reports, yield data, modeling, and GIS. </p>
<p><b>Time Scale </b><br>
  This practice can increase the SOC stock in the soil profile for 25-50 years
  or until saturation is reached. The rate of carbon sequestration may be highest
  in the initial 5-20 years. </p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, and Transparency </b><br>
  The amount of new carbon sequestration and its residence time (turnover rate)
  can be verified through ground truthing (on-site sampling). SOC content and
  bulk density can be measured at the same location over a period of time (e.g.,
  3- to 10-year interval) to a depth of 1 m. Because of the stratification of
  SOC, soil samples must be taken in small depth increments in the surface layers.
  For a few sites, the rate and magnitude of newly sequestered carbon can be determined
  by soil sampling and measurements of residue returned. Monitoring/verification
  of tillage practices can be carried out through ground surveys and potentially
  through the use of remote-sensing techniques to assess surface residue coverage.
  The modus operandi of conservation tillage is well known. The rate and type
  of herbicide use may differ among soils and ecoregions. Effective weed control
  and use of proper seeding equipment to ensure a good crop stand are important
  to ensure successful adaptation. </p>
<p><b>Removals</b><br>
  Reversion to more intensive tillage can cause loss of sequestered carbon. </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  SOC sequestration through conservation tillage depends on continued use. Reversion
  to conventional methods (high degree of disturbance) can cause loss of sequestered
  SOC. Policy measures must be in effect to ensure that conservation tillage is
  adopted on a continued basis. Adoption of conservation tillage has numerous
  ancillary benefits. Important among these benefits are control of water and
  wind erosion, water conservation, increased water-holding capacity, reduced
  compaction, increased soil resilience to chemical inputs, increased soil and
  air quality, enhanced soil biodiversity, reduced energy use, improved water
  quality, reduced siltation of reservoirs and waterways, and possible double-cropping.
  In some areas (e.g., Australia), increased leaching from greater water retention
  with conservation tillage can cause downslope salinization. In wet years, planting
  may be delayed in no-till systems, potentially resulting in a yield reduction.
</p>
<p><b>Relationship to IPCC Guidelines </b><br>
  Tillage effects on soil carbon stock changes are included in the IPCC Guidelines
  (Reference Manual), and default values for three levels of tillage intensity
  are provided. </p>
