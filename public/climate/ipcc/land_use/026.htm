<h3>1.3.2. Components of the Carbon Balance of Ecosystems </h3>
<p>To understand the fluxes of carbon between a specific ecosystem and the atmosphere
  over a specified period of time and to appreciate its sensitivity to current
  environmental conditions, disturbance, and climate change, we need to consider
  the principal component processes within the system that add up to give the
  overall NEP. The feedbacks among these processes, their speed of response, and
  their sensitivity to environmental change determine NBP-the future and long-term
  carbon sequestration potential of the ecosystem. </p>
<p><a href="fig1-3.htm">Figure 1-3</a> shows measured annual carbon fluxes in 
  a typical boreal, temperate, and tropical forest. NEP is the difference between 
  the gross input of carbon in photosynthesis, GPP, and the sum of the losses 
  of carbon in autotrophic respiration (RA) and RH. The component fluxes accumulated 
  over a year should add up to the annual NEP, which is measured independently 
  as described below (see <a href="029.htm">Section 1.3.2.3</a>). A mass balance 
  of the component fluxes above ground (photosynthesis; foliage, branch, and stem 
  respiration; leaf, branch, and stem litter production; and aboveground NPP) 
  enables an estimate to be made of the amount of carbon internally translocated 
  below ground. A mass balance of the component fluxes below ground (the inputs 
  of litter and translocate from above, root and heterotrophic respiration, fine 
  root turnover, mycorrhizal and root system NPP) enables an approximate estimate 
  to be made of net changes in the pool of soil carbon. There are appreciable 
  errors, however, in measuring all component fluxes (below-ground fluxes in particular), 
  so close agreement between the two estimates of NEP is not to be expected. </p>
<p>The processes of photosynthesis and respiration are functions of several environmental
  and plant variables, including solar radiation, air and soil temperature and
  humidity, availability of water and nutrients, atmospheric ozone and other pollutants,
  leaf area, and foliar nutrition. Climate change therefore affects these processes
  in several ways. Photosynthesis is likely to be reduced by an increase in cloud
  cover but increased by enhanced global atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration and, on
  some sites, by atmospheric nutrient deposition. All respiratory processes are
  sensitive to temperature, as is the rate of population growth of respiring organs-particularly
  the fine roots and heterotrophic organisms in the soil. Thus, "soil respiration"
  is a function of soil temperature (e.g., Boone <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Rayment
  and Jarvis, 2000), which, if increased, leads in the short term to enhanced
  mineralization of soil organic matter and the release of nutrients-which, in
  turn, feed back to stimulate photosynthesis, increased leaf area, and tree growth.
  Evidence is accumulating, however, that in the longer term soil respiration
  acclimates to the rise in temperature and stabilizes at close to the original
  rate. In semi-arid and arid regions in particular, the availability of soil
  water-and thus changes in rainfall patterns-are also of utmost importance for
  the balance between carbon gains and losses. </p>
