<h3>2.2.4. A Schemata for Forest Definitions</h3>
<p>In the context of the foregoing discussion, any set of definitions of the critical
  terms <i>forest</i> and ARD clearly introduces its own set of issues and questions.
  It is instructive to look systematically at the options on the basis of two
  primary defining criteria for forest: land use and a measure of land cover or
  biomass (<a href="#figure2-2">Figure 2-2</a>). A definition of forest could
  require that a patch of land: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Meet both requirements (i.e., current land use is forestry and land cover
    or biomass exceeds a threshold, here labeled the "LU+LC" option) </li>
  <li>Require only that either one or the other of the criteria is met ("LU or
    LC") </li>
  <li>Require only one or the other of the requirements ("LU" or "LC"). </li>
</ol>
<p>Given one of these definitions for forest, deforestation can then be broadly
  defined as the conversion of a forest to a non-forested state, and reforestation
  (and afforestation) can be defined as the conversion of a non-forested area
  to a forest. The scenarios in <a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a> analyze the implications
  of these definitions. The scenarios also examine the implications of treating
  the harvest/ regeneration cycle of operational forestry as deforestation followed
  by reforestation or as reforestation alone. Under such an interpretation (shown
  as D2 and R2 in <a href="#figure2-2">Figure 2-2</a>), deforestation and reforestation
  are regarded as activities that result in land change (possibly of short duration)
  but without reference to subsequent land-use change. </p>

<p>The status of lands falling in the off-diagonal categories (2 and 3) depends
  on definition chosen. Neither category 2 nor 3 would be included under the "LU+LC"
  definition. Both categories would be included with the "LU or LC" definition.
  Category 3 would be captured by an "LC" definition, and 2 by an "LU" definition.
</p>
<p>Areas that meet the land-cover but not the land-use criterion (category 3)
  include significant carbon pools. This circumstance is especially true for sparsely
  treed grazing lands (savanna and woodlands) that may have canopy covers of less
  than 20 percent. If the threshold for canopy cover is set too high to include
  these lands, many sparsely treed areas will fall outside the forest definition
  (appearing instead under category 4). </p>
<p>Areas that fulfill the land-use but not the land-cover criterion (category
  2) include service and recreation areas within a broader forested estate. Most
  national definitions of forest include these areas, with adjustments being made
  for their extent in calculating forest production statistics. In some nations,
  the legally defined forest estate includes extensive areas that are not currently
  forested. The carbon content of such areas will usually be relatively low, and
  they are likely to have little significance to the Protocol. If these areas
  were to be accepted as forests under the Protocol, however, devising effective
  definitions for deforestation and reforestation would be difficult. </p>
<p>A significant issue in finding a simple, unambiguous definition of a forest
  is the treatment of young stands that are regenerating after disturbance or
  harvesting. Such stands may not have reached the canopy cover or carbon threshold
  but may be expected to do so if allowed to continue their growth. <br>
  In practice, distinguishing such stands from similarly affected lands that cannot-or
  will not be permitted-to regenerate will be difficult. Delaying recognition
  of such land as forest until crown cover develops could create accounting complications.
  These problems would be greatest in stands that are disturbed or harvested near
  the end of a commitment period: Such cases may require a retrospective analysis
  to be performed, with no guarantee that the necessary data were collected. </p>
<p>The complications are exacerbated by the wide variation in regeneration rates
  among different forest vegetation types. A regenerating boreal forest stand
  may require decades for its canopy cover to reach a definitional threshold.
  Again, specific amendments to definitions can be developed (see <a href="112.htm">Chapter
  3)</a>. </p>
