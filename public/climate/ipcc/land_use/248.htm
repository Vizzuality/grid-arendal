<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (continued)</h2>
<p>Several approaches have been used to account for changes in carbon stocks or
  greenhouse gas emissions over the lifetimes of LULUCF projects. One method is
  based on calculating the difference in carbon stocks between a project and its
  baseline at a given point in time-the <i>carbon stock method</i>. The values
  provided by this method vary depending on the decision of when to account for
  the project's benefits. The <i>average storage method</i> has been used to account
  for dynamic systems in which planting, harvesting, and replanting operations
  take place. The advantage of this method is that it accounts for the dynamics
  of carbon storage over the whole project duration, not only at the times chosen
  for accounting. Another approach is to credit only a fraction of the total changes
  in carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions for each year that the project
  is maintained-the ton-year method. A variety of methods have been proposed for
  establishing an equivalency factor by analogy to Global Warming Potentials (GWPs).
  Depending on the accounting method used, the year-to-year distribution of changes
  in carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions over the project lifetime varies.
</p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol requires that LULUCF projects result in long-term impacts
  on carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. The definition of "long-term"
  varies, however, and there is no consensus on minimum time frames for project
  duration. Different approaches have been proposed to define the duration of
  projects. According to one view, the changes in carbon stocks or greenhouse
  gas emissions must be maintained in perpetuity. This argument is based on the
  assumption that "reversal" of changes in carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions
  of a project at any point in time would invalidate a project. A second view
  is that the changes in carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions must be maintained
  for a period of 100 years to be consistent with the time frames adopted in the
  Kyoto Protocol for the calculation of GWP values. Under a third view, the changes
  in carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions must be maintained until they counteract
  the effect of an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere.
  A fourth view holds that the changes in carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions
  may vary over different time frames, acknowledging that different projects may
  have different operational time frames; this approach has been adopted during
  the Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) Pilot Phase. Eventually, guidelines
  will be needed on how to calculate the changes in carbon stocks or greenhouse
  gas emissions of projects that are conducted over different lifetimes.</p>
<p>Quantification of greenhouse gas emissions or removals in LULUCF projects is
  subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Some of these factors (such
  as fires, pest and disease, storms) are inherent to certain land-use activities,
  particularly forestry; others (such as political and economic factors) may be
  generic and applicable to any greenhouse gas mitigation project in LULUCF and
  other sectors. These risks and uncertainties could be estimated and the changes
  in carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions adjusted or mitigated through project
  design, diversification of project portfolios, or insurance methods. </p>
<p>The changes in carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions associated with individual
  LULUCF projects are likely to be more readily quantified and monitored to desired
  precision levels than national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions and removals
  because of the clearly defined boundaries of project activities, the ease of
  stratification of project area, sampling efficiency, and measurement of only
  a selection of carbon pools. Techniques and methods for measuring carbon in
  vegetation and soils in LULUCF projects to relatively high levels of precision
  exist. These techniques have not been universally applied to all projects, however,
  and methods for accounting of the changes in carbon stocks have not been standardized.
  A selective accounting system could be used to choose which carbon pools to
  measure; the choice must include all pools that are expected to decrease and
  a selection of pools that are expected to increase as a result of the project.
  The requirements for verifiability in the Protocol suggest that only carbon
  pools that can be measured and monitored could be claimed. </p>
<p>The costs of measuring and monitoring carbon pools in LULUCF projects are mainly
  related to the desired precision level, which varies by project type, size of
  project, distribution of project lands (contiguous or dispersed), and natural
  variations within the various carbon pools. Different levels of sampling intensity
  can be used to balance the costs of estimating, monitoring, and verifying the
  change in carbon stocks. In a few forestry projects in tropical countries, project
  developers in the early stages of project implementation have measured and monitored
  relevant aboveground and below-ground carbon pools to precision levels of about
  10 percent of the mean at a cost of about US$1-5 ha<sup>-1</sup> and US$0.10-0.50
  per t C. The attainable accuracy and precision of carbon measurements and monitoring
  is likely to be similar among LULUCF project types, but differing measuring
  and monitoring costs will result from decisions about which particular carbon
  pools are to be measured and monitored, as well as their variability. </p>
<p>Qualified independent third-party verification plays an essential role in ensuring
  unbiased monitoring. Although there is growing experience in verification of
  baseline and project design, there is no experience with verification of monitored
  data. Guidelines are needed to help establish a procedure and institutional
  structure for verification. </p>
<p>LULUCF projects may provide significant socioeconomic and environmental benefits
  to host countries and local communities, though some types of projects pose
  significant risk of negative impacts. Experience from many pilot projects to
  date indicates that the involvement of local stakeholders in the design and
  management of project activities is often critical for success. Critical factors
  affecting the capacity of projects to provide greenhouse gas and other benefits
  include consistency with nationally defined sustainable development goals, institutional
  and technical capacity to develop and implement project guidelines and safeguards,
  and the extent and effectiveness of local community participation in project
  development and implementation.</p>
