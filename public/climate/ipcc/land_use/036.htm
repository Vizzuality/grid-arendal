<h3>1.4.4. Biomass Energy </h3>
<p>Biomass energy can be used to avoid greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels
  by providing equivalent energy services: electricity, transportation fuels,
  and heat. The avoided fossil fuel CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions of a biomass energy system are
  equal to the fossil fuels substituted by biomass energy services minus the fossil
  fuels used in the biomass energy system. These quantities can be estimated with
  a full fuel-cycle analysis of the system. The net effect on fossil fuel CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  emissions is evident as a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. </p>
<p>For biomass energy to lead to an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,
  land use and land-use change emissions of the biomass energy system must also
  be included (Marland and Schlamadinger, 1995). For example, if biomass is harvested
  and subsequently regrows without an overall loss of carbon stocks, there would
  be no net CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions over a full harvest/ growth cycle. In this way, land
  can be used continuously for the production of biomass energy to avoid fossil
  fuel CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions. By contrast, using land to grow carbon stocks to be conserved
  thereafter can only be a temporary measure to limit fossil fuel use. </p>
<p>Biomass can originate as a co-product of forestry or from crops grown expressly
  for biomass energy. For example, logging and paper mill residues are being widely
  used for heat production in Sweden (Gustavsson et al., 1995; Johansson and Lundqvist,
  1999). In Brazil, sugar cane crops are used to provide ethanol for blending
  into motor vehicle fuels, and sugar cane residue (bagasse) is being used for
  electricity generation. The use of sugar cane biomass in Brazil led to the avoidance
  of fossil fuel CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions of 9.2 Mt C yr<sup>-1</sup> through the blending of ethanol
  with fossil fuels in 1997 and 1998 (Macedo, 1998)-approximately 11 percent of
  Brazil's fossil fuel CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions (British Petroleum Company, 1999). During
  the next 10 years, the generation of an additional 3 GW of electrical power
  from sugar cane products is expected. </p>
<p>The use of land to hold stocks of carbon and to provide energy as a substitute
  for fossil fuels adds to the existing primary uses of land for agriculture,
  forestry, settlements, recreation, and conservation. The competition for land
  among these uses will partly determine the extent to which land can be used
  to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations. Analyses of scenarios of future development
  show that expanded use of biomass energy could lead to a significant reduction
  in atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentrations (Edmonds et al., 1996; Ishitani et al., 1996;
  Leemans et al., 1996). The development of technology for efficient production
  of biomass energy, as well as for competing land uses, will affect the amount
  of land available for alternative uses. Consideration of multiple uses of land
  to provide food and fiber while enhancing carbon stocks and producing energy
  may present further opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations with
  minimum use of resources. </p>
