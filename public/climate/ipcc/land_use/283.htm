<h2>5.5. Associated Impacts (Benefits and Costs) of LULUCF Projects</h2>
<p>Several authors have noted that LULUCF projects to reduce or offset GHG emissions
  can also provide significant environmental and socioeconomic "co-benefits" to
  host countries and local communities (Makundi, 1997; Brown, 1998; Frumhoff <i>et
  al.</i>, 1998; Trexler and Associates, 1998; Klooster and Masera, 2000; Lasco
  and Pulhin, 2000; Losos, 2000; Reid, 2000). Because the scale of such projects
  is prospectively large (<a href="249.htm">Section 5.1</a>), they may have substantial
  potential to help countries meet multiple sustainable development objectives.
  Some authors have also expressed concern, however, that some types of LULUCF
  projects pose significant risk of negative environmental and socioeconomic impacts
  (e.g., Cullet and Kameri-Mbote, 1998; German Advisory Council on Global Change,
  1998). <br>
  This section follows on the general assessment of sustainable development aspects
  of LULUCF measures in <a href="095.htm">Section 2.5</a> to address the following
  project-specific questions: What are the environmental and socioeconomic implications
  of different LULUCF project types? Do any of these projects pose inherently
  negative or positive impacts? </p>
<p>Representative data on the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of several
  LULUCF projects carried out under the AIJ Pilot Phase are provided in <a href="251.htm#box5-1">Box
  5-1</a>. Relatively few AIJ LULUCF projects to date have provided detailed quantification
  of observed and expected local socioeconomic impacts (Witthoeft-Muehlmann, 1998).
  The assessment in this section draws on available pilot project data and information
  from similar LULUCF projects in its evaluation of associated impacts. </p>
<h3> <a name="s5-5-1"></a>5.5.1. Associated Impacts of Project Activities that
  Avoid Emissions</h3>
<p>Pilot LULUCF projects that are designed to avoid emissions by reducing deforestation
  and forest degradation have produced marked environmental and socioeconomic
  co-benefits, including biodiversity conservation, protection of watershed and
  water resources, improved forest management and local capacity building, and
  employment in local enterprises. Substantial biodiversity benefits, for example,
  have been realized in the Rio Bravo project in northwestern Belize (<a href="251.htm#box5-1">Box
  5-1</a>) and the AES Barbers Point carbon-offset project in Paraguay (Dixon
  <i>et al.</i>, 1993), where protection of 56,800 ha of tropical forest can conserve
  existing biodiversity and restore native flora lost from logging activities.
</p>
<p>Although any LULUCF project that slows deforestation or degradation will help
  to conserve biodiversity, successful projects in threatened forests that contain
  assemblages of species that are unusually rich, globally rare, or unique to
  that region can provide the greatest biodiversity co-benefits (Dinerstein <i>et
  al.</i>, 1995; Olson and Dinerstein, 1998). One example is the Noel Kempff Mercado
  carbon-offset project in Bolivia: In a region of globally outstanding biological
  distinctiveness, a 634,000 ha timber concession has been converted into an extension
  of a national park (Dinerstein <i>et al.</i>, 1995; USIJI, 1997b; <a href="264.htm#box5-3">Box
  5-3</a>). </p>
<p>Projects that are designed to protect natural forests from land conversion
  or degradation could pose significant costs to some stakeholders if they restrict
  options for alternative land uses, such as crop production. Such costs might
  be mitigated, however, by siting projects in regions where conservation measures
  are consistent with regional land-use policies and by promoting sustainable
  agricultural intensification on associated non-forested lands. Indeed, forest
  conservation projects in areas where policies encourage agricultural expansion
  are unlikely to be successful. Critical to shaping project success in meeting
  carbon mitigation and sustainable development goals is effective participation
  by local communities affected by project activities (<a href="286.htm">Section
  5.6</a>). In the Noel Kempff Mercado project, this local participation includes
  community-run revolving funds financed by the project that provide loans for
  local sustainable development enterprises such as ecotourism, bakeries, and
  hearts-of-palm production (Brown <i>et al.</i>, 2000). </p>
<p>LULUCF projects that protect forests from land conversion or degradation in
  key watersheds have substantial potential to slow soil erosion, protect water
  resources for rural communities and municipalities (Reid, 2000), and conserve
  biodiversity (Hardner, 1996; Frumhoff <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Hardner <i>et al.</i>,
  2000). Benefits can also include reduced risk of flood damage and reduced siltation
  of rivers; the latter can protect fisheries and investments in hydroelectric
  power generation facilities (Chomitz and Kumari, 1998). One AIJ pilot project
  that is designed to provide these benefits is Costa Rica's PFP (Subak, 2000).
</p>
<p>Several AIJ pilot carbon offset projects include measures to reduce the impacts
  of logging and more generally improve the sustainability of forest management
  (Brown, 1998). As evidenced by the RIL project in Sabah, Malaysia, such projects
  can combine reduced carbon emissions with reductions in the environmental impacts
  of commercial logging, as well as socioeconomic development through technical
  training (Putz and Pinard, 1993; Pinard and Putz, 1996, 1997). </p>
<p>The carbon benefits and the associated environmental benefits of reduced-impact
  logging are captured only in forest sites that otherwise would have been logged
  by conventional methods or converted to agriculture; such benefits would not
  be gained in forests that otherwise would have been unlogged. In developing
  countries, such projects also might slow deforestation under some conditions
  by making long-term timber production more profitable than forest clearing for
  low-productivity agriculture or pasture (e.g., Boscolo <i>et al.</i>, 1997).
</p>
<p>Projects that are designed to promote reduced-impact logging as a carbon offset
  may produce fewer biodiversity co-benefits than forest protection, but they
  provide larger socioeconomic benefits for local owners (Kurz <i>et al.</i>,
  1997; Marland <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Bawa and Seidler, 1998; Frumhoff and Losos,
  1998; Klooster and Masera, 2000). Policymakers may wish to identify and consider
  prospective tradeoffs between meeting these objectives on a national basis and
  meeting them on a project-by-project basis. </p>
