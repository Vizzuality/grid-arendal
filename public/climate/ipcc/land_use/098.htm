<h5>2.5.1.1.2. Soil quality and organic carbon storage</h5>
<p>The relationship between land cover and SOC storage is briefly discussed below,
  with more detailed discussion in <a href="163.htm">Section 4.2.2</a>. Forest
  soils can store large amounts of carbon that could be released to the atmosphere
  through deforestation (Houghton <i>et al.</i>, 1983). For example, Brown and
  Lugo (1990) reported that in wet and moist life zones, sites cultivated after
  deforestation typically lose 60-70 percent of the initial carbon contained in
  mature forests. In the dry life zone, where initial soil carbon content is only
  about 50-60 percent of that in wet and moist life zone soils, soils may lose
  only 14 percent of their initial carbon under cultivation. Carbon may be lost
  by decomposition, with carbon released as CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  to the atmosphere, or by erosion-in which case carbon may be deposited somewhere
  else in the landscape, with only some lost as CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  (Lal, 1995). </p>
<p>There is ample evidence that when forests are converted to cultivated cropland,
  the organic layer is depleted, and soil carbon contents and cation exchange
  capacities can decrease (Detwiler, 1986; Mann, 1986; Schlesinger, 1986; Davidson
  and Ackerman, 1993). If cleared land is not cultivated or degraded, however,
  soil carbon amounts are mostly observed not to change over decades (e.g., Lugo
  and Brown, 1993; Christopher <i>et al.</i>, 1997)-although in some studies,
  soil carbon losses of up to 30 percent have also been reported (e.g., Garc�a-Oliva
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999). The outcome ultimately may depend more on the productivity
  of the vegetation (and hence nutrient supply and climate) than on vegetation
  type (Trumbore <i>et al.</i>, 1995). Thus, if there is no regular cultivation,
  the inter-conversion between forest and non-forest vegetation may not have a
  consistent effect on soil carbon amounts. </p>
<p>Soil organic matter (carbon) content is often related to soil fertility. Forests
  are distinct in that they develop an organic layer above the mineral soil. This
  layer generally improves physical (soil aeration, water retention, resistance
  to erodability, etc.) and biological properties (build-up of soil microorganisms,
  nutrients, etc.), which enhance the productive capacity of the soil. </p>
<p>The fertility of soils following slash-and-burn has been shown to decrease
  rapidly (Lal, 1987, 1996). Up to 80 percent of the total carbon and nitrogen
  content of the soil can be contained in macroaggregates, where it is partly
  protected from microbial action and thus more securely stored. Burning can reduce
  the amount of organic carbon associated with macroaggregates by 32 percent,
  and it can disrupt soil aggregate stabilization by changing the chemical nature
  of organic carbon (Garc�a-Oliva <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>When cultivated lands or soils that previously were low in organic matter are
  afforested or reforested, there can be substantial increases in the amount of
  soil organic matter (Ovington, 1959)-as occurs following shifting agriculture
  in the tropics. In addition, trees and their roots can play an important role
  in maintaining desirable soil physical properties (Young, 1989). Peatlands are
  exceptions: When drainage and disturbance to establish trees accelerates decomposition,
  the loss of carbon can eventually exceed the carbon store created by growing
  trees (Cannell <i>et al.</i>, 1993). </p>
<p>Grassland management may include practices that are beneficial for carbon storage
  and reduce the adverse environmental impacts of agricultural activity but would
  not be profitable without carbon compensation (e.g., allowing savanna thickening
  at the expense of livestock production). <a href="157.htm">Chapter 4</a> provides
  more detail on the sustainable development impacts of changes in agricultural
  practices. </p>
<p>The introduction of forest operations such as harvesting and site preparation
  in areas that remain as forest have the potential to decrease the amount of
  soil carbon if litter inputs to the soil are reduced (Liski <i>et al.</i>, 1998;
  Thornley and Cannell, 2000). In most instances, however, detecting changes in
  soil organic matter observationally may be difficult (Johnson, 1992). </p>
<p>The Parties will have to decide which carbon pools to include as recognized
  carbon stocks (<a href="059.htm">Section 2.3</a>). If soil carbon pools were
  not included in the list of carbon stocks, there would be no incentive to maximize
  carbon storage in this important reservoir. Soil cultivation, for example, could
  be exercised to stimulate forest growth even though it could reduce soil carbon
  storage and thus lower total overall site carbon storage. Inclusion of all on-site
  carbon stocks for carbon accounting purposes would ensure that management options
  will have to consider effects on all of these pools. </p>
<p>Managing agricultural soils to store more carbon is likely to have ancillary
  benefits by reducing soil erosion; the use of cover crops, crop rotations, nutrient
  management, and organic amendments is likely to increase soil fertility and
  enhance food security for affected populations. Hence, practices such as improved
  crop productivity and conservation tillage may be warranted independent of their
  carbon sequestration benefits. As a result, the opportunity costs of these mitigation
  strategies may be fairly low. Another relevant activity is the removal of land
  from agricultural production. Such removal may be warranted for land that generates
  substantial carbon emissions in its current use or has high potential for carbon
  storage when it is left undisturbed. The opportunity costs for these set-asides
  depends on the land's relative productive potential in its current use. </p>
