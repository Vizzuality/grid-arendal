<h3>5.2.5. Factors that May Affect the Realized Magnitude of Projects</h3>
<p>Studies and pilot project experience indicate that the net costs per ton of
  carbon of LULUCF mitigation activities in developing countries can be relatively
  modest or even negative (i.e., such projects may be profitable) in some projects
  and conditions (e.g., Makundi and Okiting'ati, 1995; Masera <i>et al</i> 1995;
  Ravindranath and Somashekhar, 1995; Wangwacharakul and Bowonwiwat, 1995; Xu,
  1995). Annex I country estimates of LULUCF activities are generally found to
  be relatively higher per ton of carbon, but a substantial supply of sequestration
  or GHG reductions may be available at less than $20 per t C (Brown <i>et al.</i>,
  1996). </p>
<p>Only a limited number of potential projects are likely to be funded and implemented,
  however, as a result of community, investor, and national government priorities
  and cost-effectiveness (Mulongoy <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1999).
  The cost-effectiveness of LULUCF project activities will compete with the costs
  of achieving emissions reductions in other sectors-domestically within each
  country and internationally-under continual technological innovation in the
  energy sector, as well as the development of the GHG emissions reduction market.
</p>
<p>Pilot projects in Annex I and non-Annex I countries commonly face high transaction
  costs (e.g., for implementing, monitoring, and reporting project activities)
  (World Bank, 1997; UNFCCC, 1999a). One key uncertainty is how transaction costs
  will be affected by the implementation of any eventual standardized guidelines
  for monitoring and verifying project emissions reductions and associated impacts
  on sustainable development. Transaction costs and risk may decline as carbon
  markets develop and standard financial techniques to spread risk and reduce
  uncertainty evolve (e.g., diversified portfolios, futures options contracts,
  and project performance insurance) (Frumhoff <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Smith <i>et
  al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>The types of future projects financed may not reflect patterns to date because
  economies of scale may favor larger scale activities with low costs (Smith <i>et
  al.</i>, 1999). Investors with substantial near-term carbon liabilities may
  have a strong incentive to invest in projects that have the potential to provide
  carbon credits quickly though at a net cost (such as forest conservation). By
  contrast, investors with relatively modest near-term liabilities may have a
  strong incentive to invest in projects that provide carbon credits relatively
  slowly, but at a net profit-such as managed plantations (Frumhoff <i>et al.</i>,
  1998; Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>An example of how mixed incentives for LULUCF activities could occur has been
  raised by critics of the Kyoto Protocol. Non-Annex I countries would not have
  commitments to meet assigned amounts of GHG emissions, hence would not have
  emissions from deforestation or forest degradation counted against their assigned
  amounts. Financial incentives might exist to harvest or degrade forest lands
  to receive revenues from the timber products produced and the CERs generated
  if such lands were eligible for reforestation as project-based activities (Greenpeace,
  1998; Chomitz, 2000). This situation could produce tensions for Parties between
  objectives of the UNFCCC and the Biodiversity Convention. At least two options
  exist to address this concern. First, the definition of reforestation activities
  selected by the Parties could limit reforestation to lands deforested prior
  to the commencement of non-Annex I project-based activities (<a href="112.htm">Chapter
  3</a> discusses this approach for Article 3.3 reforestation). Second, individual
  Parties could use the sustainable development conditionality of Article 12 to
  preclude eligibility for projects that reforest recently deforested lands-on
  biological diversity, conservation, or other grounds. The economic benefits
  to the host country of large-scale projects could be a disincentive for countries
  to limit LULUCF investments in any way, however, eroding their ability to manage
  such investments and their associated socioeconomic and environmental impacts
  (Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>Integrated projects or portfolios may offer potential synergies that address
  several technical issues. A sequestration component could provide sustainably
  managed forest products and reduce leakage from a conservation component, and
  a bioenergy component could provide jobs and low-cost power that is important
  to the sustainable development priorities of host countries, as well as enhanced
  profitability for investors (Niles and Schwarze, 2000). This approach has not
  been widely experimented with to date. </p>
<p>The public policy environment for the agriculture, forestry, and industrial
  sectors varies across countries and may facilitate or inhibit the penetration
  rate of LULUCF projects. Such policies could address tax incentives or subsides
  for afforestation, reforestation, or deforestation; land conversion to agriculture
  or alternative agricultural practices; land tenure; agrarian reform; and sustainable
  development more generally (Repetto and Gillis, 1988; Smith <i>et al.</i>, 1999).
  A review of the feasibility of significant levels of project-based LULUCF activity
  in non-Annex I countries under the Kyoto Protocol argues that the removal of
  distortionary national policies that promote forest degradation and land-use
  change may be a prerequisite for projects in some developing countries (Smith
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
<p>A major potential limitation on LULUCF project penetration into the market
  for CERs and ERUs is the perception that LULUCF projects are less likely to
  produce credible, real, additional reductions. Two major perceptions are often
  advanced: the perceived difficulty of establishing the additionality of project
  benefits versus baselines and the claim that LULUCF projects are more difficult
  to measure and monitor and have greater leakage of GHG benefits than energy
  sector projects (Greenpeace, 1998; Trexler and Associates, 1998). A review of
  projects in the energy and LULUCF sectors (Chomitz, 2000) assessed five critical
  technical issues: additionality, baseline and systems boundary issues (including
  leakage), measurement, duration, and local social and environmental impacts.
  This assessment found that LULUCF and energy projects face parallel, comparable
  issues in measurement and in ensuring social and environmental benefits. In
  general, it is not possible to assert that energy projects are superior as a
  class to LULUCF projects on these grounds. The one significant difference identified
  between projects in these two sectors is the issue of project duration: LULUCF
  activities can be halted or their emissions reductions emitted. Similarly, a
  review of eight commonly raised technical issues in 12 CDM-like projects or
  activities in Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa (including seven LULUCF
  projects) found that about half of the concerns were minor or well managed by
  the project developers. Additionality, host country institution capacity, and
  baselines and leakage were the main concerns that needed more effort to be adequately
  addressed (Sathaye <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
