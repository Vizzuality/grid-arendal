<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<h4>The Global Carbon Cycle </h4>
<ul>
  <li> During the period 1850-1998, approximately 405 + 60 Gt C has been emitted
    as carbon dioxide (CO<span class="subscript">2</span>) into the atmosphere as a result of fossil fuel burning
    and cement production (67 percent), and land use and land-use change (33 percent),
    predominantly from forested areas. As a result, the atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration
    has risen from 285 � 5 ppmv to 366 ppmv (i.e., about a 28 percent increase).
    This increase in CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration accounts for about 40 percent of these
    anthropogenic emissions, the remainder having been absorbed by the oceans
    and terrestrial ecosystems. </li>
  <li> CO<span class="subscript">2</span> that is dissolved into the ocean will be transferred progressively
    to the deep ocean, and the carbon content of this reservoir is increased.
    The fate of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> that is fixed on land depends on which ecosystem and which
    carbon pool is the repository (e.g., living biomass or soils). Carbon fixed
    into a pool with a turnover time of one year or less (leaves, fine roots)
    is returned to the atmosphere or transferred into pools with a longer turnover
    time of decades to centuries (stems, trunks, soil organic matter). </li>
  <li> The net global carbon flux between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere
    is the result of a small imbalance between uptake by photosynthesis and release
    by various return processes. Plants, soil microbes, biochemical processes,
    animals, and disturbances contribute to the latter. Variations of climate
    and human activities have a major impact through land use and land-use changes,
    as well as indirectly through carbon dioxide fertilization, nutrient deposition,
    and air pollution. </li>
  <li> This global net carbon exchange has resulted in an uptake of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> by the
    terrestrial biosphere amounting to 0.2 � 1.0 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> (90-percent confidence
    interval) over the 1980s (1980-89), and 0.7 � 1.0 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> during the most
    recent decade (1989-98) (see <a href="020.htm#table1-2">Table 1-2</a>). It
    is unclear if the increase in the 1990s is a result of natural variability
    or, to some extent, also a trend induced by human activities. </li>
  <li> The direct effects of land use and land-use change are estimated to have
    led to a net emission of 1.7 � 0.8 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> during the 1980s, and 1.6 Gt
    C yr<sup>-1</sup> during the 1990s. The difference between the net global terrestrial
    uptake and human-induced emissions as a result of land use and land-use change
    leaves a residual terrestrial uptake of 1.9 � 1.3 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> for the 1980s
    and 2.3 � 1.3 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> for the 1990s. </li>
  <li> The global net carbon flux varies from one year to another. These variations
    are on the order �1 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> and are correlated with variations in climate
    (e.g., El Ni�o/La Ni�a events) and major volcanic eruptions. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Present Knowledge about Global Terrestrial Ecosystems </h4>
<ul>
  <li> Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is the uptake of carbon from the atmosphere
    by plants (global total approximately 120 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>). Carbon losses as a result
    of plant respiration reduce this uptake to the Net Primary Productivity (NPP;
    global total approximately 60 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>). Further losses occur because of
    decomposition of dead organic matter, resulting in Net Ecosystem Productivity
    (NEP; global total approximately 10 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>). Additional losses are caused
    by disturbances, such as fire, wind-throw, drought, pests, and human activities.
    The resulting net imbalance of the terrestrial ecosystem can be interpreted
    as the Net Biome Productivity (NBP; presently approximately 0.7 � 1.0 Gt C
    yr<sup>-1</sup>, as a decadal average; see <a href="024.htm#figure1-2">Figure 1-2</a>).
  </li>
  <li> Forests contain a large part of the carbon stored on land, in the form
    of biomass (trunks, branches, foliage, roots etc.) and in the form of soil
    organic carbon (<a href="019.htm#table1-1">Table 1-1</a>). On a time scale
    of years, most forests accumulate carbon through the growth of trees and an
    increase in soil carbon, until the next disturbance occurs. The net carbon
    uptake (NEP) may locally reach 7 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, but losses may also be observed
    when soil carbon is decreasing or trees are overmature and mortality is occurring.
  </li>
  <li> In cropland ecosystems, carbon stocks are primarily in the form of below-ground
    plant organic matter and soil. Most of these ecosystems have large annual
    carbon uptake rates, but much of the gain is exported in the form of agricultural
    products and their associated waste materials; this gain is rapidly released
    to the atmosphere. Although carbon is recaptured during the succeeding cropping
    season, many agricultural soils are currently net sources of carbon. Shifting
    to low or no till cultivation is, however, increasingly being used to mitigate
    such trends. </li>
  <li> By far most of the carbon stocks in grassland and savannas, including rangelands
    and pasture, are found in the soils. These stocks are stable over long time
    spans, but losses can occur if grazing pressure exceeds carrying capacity
    or if the frequency of fires increases. </li>
  <li> Wetland stocks of carbon are found almost entirely in the soil as dead
    organic matter, which can be released by human activity, such as drainage.
    Afforestation may effectively compensate for such development. Soil carbon
    in subarctic wetlands may also be released as a result of reduction of permafrost
    resulting from climate warming. </li>
  <li> Globally, carbon stocks in the soil exceed carbon stocks in vegetation
    by a factor of about five (<a href="019.htm#table1-1">Table 1-1</a>). This
    ratio ranges from about 1:1 in tropical forests to 5:1 in boreal forests and
    much larger factors in grasslands and wetlands. Changes in soil carbon stocks
    are at least as important for carbon budgets as changes in vegetation carbon
    stocks. </li>
</ul>
