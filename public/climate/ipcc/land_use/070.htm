<h3>2.3.5. System Boundaries </h3>
<p>The boundaries that are set in defining LULUCF activities and projects can
  greatly influence the credit attributed to an activity and its true value in
  avoiding dangerous levels of GHGs in the atmosphere. Boundaries and other aspects
  of carbon accounting can affect decisions on allocating global warming mitigation
  funds between the energy and LULUCF sectors, as well as among different types
  of activities within the LULUCF sector. </p>
<h4><a name="s2-3-5-1"></a>2.3.5.1. Carbon Pools </h4>
<p>One issue is defining which system components are included in the analyses.
  If system boundaries were defined to exclude some pools, there would be a risk
  of outcomes in which activities receive carbon credit when they actually result
  in net emissions. If one considers only the soil component, for example, converting
  forests or poorly managed pastures to well-managed pastures could increase carbon
  storage in Amazonian soils (e.g., Cerri <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Batjes and Sombroek,
  1997). Forest conversions, however, lead to losses of carbon from biomass that
  much more than offset any potential gains in the soil. The same consideration
  applies to the question of whether conversion of natural savannas to improved
  pastures increases carbon stocks (Fisher <i>et al.</i>, 1994) or decreases them
  (Nepstad <i>et al.</i>, 1995). </p>
<p>Even within the soil sphere, the predominant pasture management system in Amazonia
  today results in substantial losses of soil carbon (Fearnside and Barbosa, 1998).
  In addition, if deep soil (below 1-m depth) is included in analyses and a long
  time horizon is considered, pasture can result in large emissions of soil carbon
  even if the stock in the surface soil has increased because trees have much
  deeper roots than pasture grasses: Some tree roots penetrate more than 8 m (Nepstad
  <i>et al.</i>, 1994). Roots supply carbon to the soil through exudates and root
  death (turnover); when deep-rooted trees are removed, the soil-carbon equilibrium
  in the deep soil shifts to a lower level over a period of decades (Trumbore
  <i>et al.</i>, 1995). </p>
<p>The question of whether subsidizing improved pasture management in Amazonia
  would result in carbon benefits is very important. Although some observers maintain
  that ranchers switching to improved pasture management will slow their rates
  of forest clearance (Faminow, 1998), evidence reviewed by Fearnside (1999a)
  indicates that increased capital supply to ranchers (from subsidies and from
  more profitable pastures) would have the opposite effect on deforestation. Although
  the impetus for the expansion of cattle ranching in Brazilian Amazonia currently
  comes largely from profit sources other than sale of beef (Fearnside, 2000a),
  saturation of the beef market will eventually reduce beef prices and contribute
  to limiting further deforestation for pasture. The possibility that this effect
  could form the basis of a cost-effective strategy for global warming mitigation
  has been questioned, however (Fearnside, 2000a). </p>
