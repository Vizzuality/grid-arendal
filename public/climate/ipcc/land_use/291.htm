<h2>5.7. Implications of Project-Based Activities for Countries with and without
  Assigned Amounts of Emissions</h2>
<p>All of the major issues-project permanence, additionality, and potential leakage
  and risks-present different implications for countries with national assigned
  amounts than for countries without assigned amounts. Some of these issues also
  show specific characteristics by project type (<a href="#table5-10">Table 5-10</a>).
  The implications for carbon accounting, as well as associated socioeconomic
  and capacity-building components, are also different depending on whether the
  countries currently have or do not have national assigned amounts (<a href="#table5-10">Table
  5-10</a>). </p>
<p>The fate of GHG benefits when the project ends, the risks associated with projects,
  leakage, and additionality are all major issues for countries without national
  assigned amounts-particularly for emissions avoidance and carbon sequestration
  projects-because these countries are not required to capture project activities
  in national greenhouse gas inventories. For the same reasons, the choice of
  accounting methods and the control of leakage are also critical. This last issue
  may be addressed voluntarily and reported on national communications (<a href="#table5-10">Table
  5-10</a>). </p>
<p>For countries with assigned amounts, project duration is important if the project
  does not fall under Articles 3.3 or 3.4, if liability for post-project period
  emissions is not clear, or if the commitment periods are not contiguous. Determination
  of adequate baselines and establishment of project additionality are required
  for projects that fall under Article 6 (and perhaps for projects falling under
  Article 12). Concerns regarding methods for GHG accounting at the project level
  are not as critical because all countries-including those with assigned amounts-are
  required to prepare a national GHG inventory. Double-counting could be an issue,
  however, if project activities cannot be captured in national inventories. Potential
  transnational leakage between countries with and without assigned amounts is
  important to consider because such leakage is not captured by the emissions
  limitation of Annex I countries (Gustavsson <i>et al.</i>, 1999). </p>
