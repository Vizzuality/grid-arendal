<h3>4.2.1. Land Use, Management, and Ecosystem Carbon Balances (continued) </h3>
<p></p>
<p>The main factors that determine the rate and duration of carbon gain in a given
  ecosystem after a management change follow: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>The form the newly stored carbon takes.</i> Carbon is stored in terrestrial
    ecosystems in diverse organic forms with a wide range of mean residence times
    (Balesdent and Mariotti, 1996; Harrison, 1996; Skjemstad <i>et al.</i>, 1996;
    Trumbore and Zheng, 1996). The mean residence time (MRT) is the average time
    a carbon atom spends in a given pool. Some carbon-for example, much of the
    carbon in fresh litter or non-woody biomass-is ephemeral and returns quickly
    to the atmosphere (Stott <i>et al.</i> 1983). Other carbon, such as that in
    woody materials or "active" soil organic matter fractions, may persist for
    decades (<a href="#table4-3">Table 4-3</a>). The most persistent stock of
    carbon is stable soil carbon (including charcoal) that may have an MRT as
    high as 1000 years or more because of chemical inertness or interaction with
    soil minerals (Balesdent and Mariotti, 1996; Paul <i>et al.</i>, 1997a). The
    amount and duration of carbon gain within an ecosystem depend on the temporal
    dynamics of these different pools: Transient pools may increase rapidly but
    quickly level off, whereas carbon that is incorporated into more stable pools
    can produce slow but long-term increases. Consequently, the initial impact
    of land-use or management change occurs disproportionately in pools with shorter
    residence times (Cambardella and Elliott, 1992; Huggins et al., 1998a), whereas
    increases in stable soil pools occur slowly over a much longer time period
    (see <a href="#figure4-3">Figure 4-3</a>).</li>
  <li><i> The degree of land-use or management change.</i> The potential carbon
    gain depends on the carbon stock potential of the new practice relative to
    that of the previous practice (Greenland, 1995). Consequently, a wholesale
    change from one land use to another (e.g., cropland to forestland) often elicits
    the largest response in carbon stock change. Within a given land use, potential
    carbon sequestration depends on how far the current carbon status is below
    the eventual maximum storage of the newly adopted practice. All else being
    equal, an ecosystem that has been under effective carbon-conserving management
    for several years has less potential for further storage than one that has
    been severely depleted of carbon. In ecosystems in which carbon stocks are
    already near maximum, the primary focus may be preserving existing stocks.
  </li>
  <li><i> The persistence of current management and climatic regimes.</i> Continued
    accumulation of carbon in response to new management or land use depends on
    continued application of that new practice; a reversal can lead to partial
    or complete loss of previous gains (Dick <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Stockfisch <i>et
    al.</i>, 1999). The long-term pattern of carbon accumulation also is responsive
    to changes in climatic conditions. For example, accumulations of stored carbon
    may be susceptible to loss from accelerated decomposition under higher temperatures
    in future decades (Jenkinson, 1991; Trumbore <i>et al.</i>, 1996), although
    losses may be at least partially offset by the effects of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
    fertilization (see <a href="014.htm">Chapter 1</a>). As carbon stocks increase,
    so does the potential for future losses from regressive management or unfavorable
    climatic conditions. </li>
</ul>
<p>The effect of a new management or land use on atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  cannot be judged solely on the basis of net carbon storage within the ecosystem
  (see <a href="#figure4-4">Figure 4-4</a>). In many "managed" ecosystems, there
  is significant removal of carbon in harvested product. Some of this harvested
  carbon may accumulate in long-term repositories (e.g., wood products), and some
  is quickly returned to the atmosphere via respiration (e.g., agricultural products)
  (see also <a href="051.htm#figure2-2">Figure 2-2</a>). Thus, the full impact
  of a new management practice on atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  can be assessed only by including net changes in off-site carbon stocks. </p>

<p>Energy use-notably that from fossil fuel used to establish and maintain a given
  land use-also affects the net exchange of carbon between the ecosystem and the
  atmosphere (<a href="#figure4-4">Figure 4-4</a>). Consequently, if a management
  or land-use change affects energy use, the corresponding CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  emission affects the net carbon balance. For example, if an effort to increase
  soil carbon in cropland requires higher fertilization, the CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  from energy involved in manufacturing that fertilizer may partially offset soil
  carbon gains (Flach <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Janzen <i>et al</i>., 1998; Schlesinger,
  1999). By replacing fossil fuel, biofuels can reduce the net emission of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  (Cole <i>et al.</i>, 1997). </p>

<p>Some land management practices may also affect emission of GHGs other than
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, thereby augmenting or offsetting CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  sources and sinks. For example, wetland restoration may increase methane emissions
  (see <a href="241.htm">Fact Sheet 4.18</a>); greater use of nitrogen fertilizers
  to enhance crop productivity (<a href="224.htm">Fact Sheet 4.1</a>) may enhance
  N<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions; biomass burning emits CH<span class="subscript">4</span>
  and N<span class="subscript">2</span>O; and conversion of arable land to grassland
  may reduce N<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions (<a href="230.htm">Fact
  Sheet 4.7</a>). Emissions from these activities are already estimated and reported
  in a country's GHG inventory under the Revised Guidelines for National Greenhouse
  Gas Inventories, hereafter referred to as the IPCC Guidelines (IPCC, 1997);
  nevertheless, these emissions must be considered when a Party is contemplating
  the adoption of any new carbon-conserving practices. </p>
