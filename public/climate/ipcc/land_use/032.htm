<h3>1.3.3. The Future of the Terrestrial Carbon Sink </h3>
<p><a href="020.htm#table1-2">Table 1-2</a> illustrates the considerable uncertainty
  about the relative importance of the present global oceanic and terrestrial
  sinks in acting as negative feedbacks on the rate of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> increase. These sinks
  may also change in the future as atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> continues to rise. The question
  therefore arises whether these feedbacks may reach some limit, so that no additional
  carbon can be stored on land. This possibility would imply that the airborne
  fraction of emissions would increase more rapidly in the future than at present.
</p>
<p>How long the current carbon sink capacity of the terrestrial biosphere is likely
  to be maintained into the future is a matter of conjecture; several hypotheses
  proposed as the basis for quantitative explanation are discussed here. Consideration
  of the nature of the uncertainties for such projections is essential, however.
  The time scale of our immediate concerns with respect to the biospheric sink
  as a possible means of reducing the impact of GHG emissions is considered to
  be several decades, but longer time scales may become relevant if emissions
  of GHGs continue to rise. Projections of future sources and sinks of carbon
  in terrestrial ecosystems depend on multiple aspects of the future environment:
  climate (temperature, precipitation, humidity, and radiation), atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
  concentration, nutrient deposition, land use, and ecosystem management (Thompson
  et al., 1996). Projections of most of these variables into the medium term are
  highly uncertain, particularly with respect to their future spatial patterns.
  The regional distribution of ecosystems is an important factor influencing the
  overall sink capacity. Therefore, improved regional scenarios for human land
  use are as important for better sink strength projections as they are for better
  regional climate scenarios. </p>
<p>We may assume that the total capacity for carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems
  has an upper limit as a result of mechanical and physiological constraints on
  the amount of aboveground biomass and physiochemical constraints on the amount
  of carbon that can be held in soils. These fundamental limits are presently
  not known in quantitative terms, but it does not seem very likely that they
  will become of importance within a few decades. Over the past 10,000 years-since
  the last glaciation-carbon has accumulated in the boreal and north temperate
  forest ecosystems very largely as transfer from the atmosphere, via vegetation,
  to the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Experimental addition of nutrients has
  demonstrated the large capacity of these ecosystems for additional tree growth,
  production of detritus, and SOC. We may therefore conclude that this accumulation
  of carbon has been constrained since the retreat of the ice by the slow concurrent
  accumulation of nutrients, particularly nitrogen, in the ecosystem. The present
  small size of trees in the boreal region and their low nitrogen content suggest
  that the capacity of the system to store carbon will not by itself limit the
  transfer of carbon from the atmosphere to the tree and soil pools in the immediate
  future. Because an accelerated rate of climate change, as well as continuing
  atmospheric inputs, may increase the availability of nitrogen, it is possible
  that boreal ecosystems could increase their aboveground and below-ground carbon
  storage considerably. </p>
<p>By contrast, moist tropical forests in general have large standing stocks of
  carbon in the trees (<a href="020.htm#table1-2">Table 1-2</a>). Therefore, there
  may be limited scope for additional storage of carbon in the trees, although
  that is less likely to be the case in sparse or secondary tropical forest (Phillips
  <i>et al</i>., 1998). At present, moist tropical forests currently have high
  NPP and NEP (<a href="028.htm">Section 1.3.2.2</a>), so it is questionable whether
  this ongoing flow of carbon from the atmosphere into tropical forests can be
  maintained. Significant amounts of carbon leave tropical forests in floodwaters
  as particulate and dissolved organic carbon, some of which is subsequently stored
  in coastal sediments (Schlesinger, 1997). This and other removals of carbon
  from tropical forests may provide the opportunity for some increased uptake
  from the atmosphere and transfer to storage. </p>
<p>Research has demonstrated that in the short term, increased photosynthesis
  resulting from the rise in atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration diminishes at higher
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentrations, whereas RA and RH increase exponentially with increasing
  temperature (e.g., Boone <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Rayment and Jarvis, 2000). Thus,
  Scholes <i>et al.</i> (1998) have hypothesized that as atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration
  and temperature rise, the overall capacity to take up additional carbon from
  the atmosphere will progressively diminish so that at some point respiration
  will exceed photosynthesis and the carbon sink will become a source. Based on
  these two short-term physiological response functions, Scholes (1999) evaluated
  the global terrestrial carbon sink under various assumptions and concluded that
  the global sink would be likely to decline from its current level of approximately
  2 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> and become a source within a few decades. This approach assumes
  that acclimation to higher CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentrations and temperatures does not occur,
  that respiration is independent of photosynthesis, and that there are no feedbacks
  involving nutrition between the processes. A similar, parallel, hypothesis is
  that the present sink might be a temporary consequence of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fertilization
  that eventually will be overtaken by respiratory losses of carbon as temperature
  rises and respiration "catches up." It is supposed that while photosynthesis
  increases in response to the increased availability of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, respiration will
  initially lag behind but will eventually catch up as the supply of substrate
  increases or the temperature lag resulting from the thermal inertia of the oceans
  declines. </p>
<p>To better understand the range of future terrestrial uptake of carbon, calculations
  with a suite of several more detailed terrestrial biosphere models have been
  based on the IPCC IS92a scenario of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> increase and the associated climate
  change simulated by the HadCM2 General Circulation Model (GCM) (Cramer <i>et
  al.</i>, 2000). These models include integrated physiological effects of climate,
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, and nutrition on plant growth and plant population dynamics but include
  no consideration of land-use or management effects. Stimulation of carbon uptake
  as a result of enhanced uptake of soil nitrogen is included in several of the
  models. For the IPCC IS92a scenario, all of the models confirm that there is
  a terrestrial CO<span class="subscript">2</span> sink of the same order of magnitude as above that explains
  the present-day overall balance; that this sink might increase in strength with
  further increases in CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration; and that when the CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration
  increases beyond about 500 ppmv CO<span class="subscript">2</span> (i.e., around 2030-2050), the rate of increase
  of the sink approaches zero as the sink reaches a steady asymptote. </p>

	  <i><b>Figure 1-4:</b> The hypothetical time-evolution
	  of annual-average on-site carbon stocks is given (a) for two illustrative
	  cases of land use, land-use change, and forestry. Both cases begin with
	  a common maturing forest stand that is undisturbed for the first 20
	  years; natural variability, as well as an overall increase, in stocks
	  occurs over this period. After 20 years, the forest stand is cleared
	  and a fraction of the forest stocks is exported off-site as forest products.
	  Following clearing, the land is used for forestry in one case and agriculture
	  in the other. In both cases, carbon stocks continue to fall immediately
	  following clearing due to loss of carbon from detritus and soils. In
	  the cases subsequent to clearing, sustainable forestry is carried out
	  with a 40-year stand cycle, and cultivation is carried out to yield
	  crops with some further loss of soil carbon. For these cases, the change
	  in carbon stocks over a running 5-year period (b) fluctuates due to
	  both variability and human activities. Carbon stocks contained in forest
	  and agricultural product exports off-site are not included in this illustration.
	  Carbon stocks in products generally have a finite lifetime (see <a href="035.htm">Section
	  1.4.3</a>) and can be considered in a total carbon stock inventory (see
	  <a href="112.htm">Chapter 3</a>).</i>

<p>A similar result has been obtained using a well-validated local-scale ecosystem
  model (G'Day) that treats interactions and feedbacks between the effects of
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and temperature on the pools and fluxes of carbon and nitrogen within vegetation
  and soil compartments of terrestrial ecosystems (Dewar <i>et al.</i>, 1999;
  McMurtrie et al., n.d.). This model was parameterized for a boreal coniferous
  forest in northern Sweden; temperature and CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration were increased
  according to the IPCC IS92a scenario as above. The G'Day model indicates that,
  after initiation, NPP consistently exceeds RH and the carbon sink rises to an
  asymptotic maximum after about 60 years and remains there for another 50 years
  without significant decline (McMurtrie et al., n.d.). The capacity at which
  the sink stabilizes depends on the availability of nitrogen and the fraction
  of nitrogen released in decomposition that is subsequently re-immobilized. Thus,
  with appropriate feedbacks and N:C relationships considered, this model also
  predicts that the carbon sink will be maintained well into the medium term.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, sinks may disappear if climate change or deforestation would
  lead to widespread tree mortality (Friend et al., 1997; Cao and Woodward, 1998;
  Walker <i>et al</i>., 1999). Of the suite of models discussed above, one model
  (HYBRID) (Friend et al., 1997) predicts a drastic decline in NPP that is primarily
  the result of drought-induced die-back of tropical forest in the Amazon basin.
  This finding highlights two points: First, changes in vegetation structure can
  have significant effects on terrestrial carbon sinks and indeed can be as important
  or more important than the physiological effects discussed above (see also Mooney
  et al., 1999); second, projections of climate change impacts should be based
  on a range of predictions of future regional climates. The HadCM2 GCM produces
  somewhat drier climate change predictions for the Amazon than do some other
  GCMs, which might well lead to different results. </p>
<p>These model experiments and other analyses (e.g., Walker <i>et al</i>., 1999)
  suggest that the current global terrestrial sink will be maintained over the
  short term of the next few decades unless serious mortality occurs but may diminish
  toward the end of the 21st century. With the present state of knowledge, projections
  beyond a few decades must be regarded as uncertain; this situation is improving
  rapidly, however. </p>
<p>This conclusion is based on consideration of the effects of future CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and
  climate change on the present terrestrial sink only; it does not take into account
  future deforestation or possible actions taken to enhance the terrestrial sink
  through land use, land-use change, and afforestation or reforestation. Higher
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration and warmer climate may be expected to modify the effectiveness
  of such activities to enhance the medium-term terrestrial sink. Improved understanding
  of these effects would enable these activities to be better adapted to future
  CO<span class="subscript">2</span> and climate conditions. </p>
