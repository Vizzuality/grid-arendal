<h4>2.3.7. Accounting for Uncertainty </h4>
<p>Uncertainty in accounting for land-use change and forestry activities includes
  not only measurement uncertainty but uncertainty in defining and quantifying
  baselines (when they are used) and uncertainty related to the interpretation
  of the Protocol's requirements, including the definitions of key terms. Discussion
  of the magnitude of these uncertainties and approaches for minimizing them appear
  in <a href="044.htm">Section 2.2</a> and in subsequent chapters related to specific
  Articles. This section briefly describes options for incorporating uncertainty
  into the accounting framework. <br>
<br>
  All GHG emissions and removals reported under the Kyoto Protocol will be subject
  to uncertainty to varying degrees. Dispersed emission sources, for example,
  face many of the same measurement challenges as LULUCF activities. Uncertainty
  enters the accounting system in a different way under the accounting framework
  adopted for LULUCF, however, than it does for sources that form part of the
  baseline for the Kyoto Protocol. In the latter case, systematic and random errors
  will be present in the 1990 emissions baseline and the emissions inventory during
  the commitment period. As long as consistent methods are used to estimate emissions
  in both periods, the potential to introduce bias into the accounting system
  will be minimized. On the other hand, LULUCF activities for which Annex I countries
  gain credit will only enter as a credit during the commitment period for most
  Annex I Parties. As a result, systematic errors are not offset through subtraction
  of the same error during the baseline period. Similarly, any change in measurement
  methods would affect only net emissions during the commitment period, without
  a compensating change in emission baselines (and thus assigned amounts under
  the Kyoto Protocol). </p>
<p>Accounting rules can be used to adjust for data limitations and uncertainty.
  For example, conservative estimates of carbon benefits can be applied by including
  all pools expected to have reduced carbon stocks and only a selection of pools
  expected to have increased carbon stocks; only the pools that are measured and
  monitored would be claimed as a carbon benefit (Sathaye <i>et al.</i>, 1997).
  Similarly, measurement uncertainty could be accounted for by adjusting estimated
  fluxes, based on the uncertainty in this estimate, in the direction that is
  likely to understate removals and overstate emissions. This approach would provide
  an incentive to reduce uncertainties to the extent that it is cost-effective
  to do so, but it would not require expensive monitoring of carbon pools that
  do not significantly affect the overall carbon balance of a site. </p>
