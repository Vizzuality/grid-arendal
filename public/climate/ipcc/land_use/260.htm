<h5>5.3.2.1.1. Project-specific versus generic </h5>
<p>Most projects developed under the AIJ Pilot Phase have used project-specific,
  bottom-up baselines determined by project developers (Moura-Costa <i>et al.</i>,
  2000; see also <a href="259.htm#table5-4">Table 5-4</a>). The attractions of
  this approach are that analysis focuses on specific areas and activities relating
  to the project and that developers may have a better knowledge of local conditions.
  Because land-use practices and change processes are often spatially and temporally
  variable, a detailed project-specific study arguably is likely to yield a more
  accurate prediction of emissions than a broader regional or sectoral assessment.
  Giving project developers the task of developing baselines also introduces the
  risk, however, that they may choose scenarios that maximize their perceived
  benefits (Tipper and de Jong, 1998). Moreover, ensuring consistency between
  assessments may be difficult if different teams develop many baselines. Allowing
  <i>ad hoc</i> project baselines could lead to inconsistent approaches among
  similar projects and increase the risk that project baselines would be set strategically
  to maximize the potential to generate credits. </p>
<p>Generic methods that have been proposed but not yet tested include benchmarking
  models similar to those being assessed for the industrial and energy sectors
  (Center for Clean Air Policy, 1998; Hargrave <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Baumert, 1999;
  Ellis and Bosi, 1999; Friedman, 1999; Jepma, 1999; Michaelowa, 1999). For example,
  certain practices could be considered "standard management practice," and baselines
  might be set to reflect the level of carbon sequestration or emissions avoidance
  that would occur if these practices were universally applied. Credit would then
  be available only to the extent that a project improved on the results that
  would be obtained by simply applying these standard practices. Because the development
  of credible baseline scenarios represents a significant capital cost, the use
  of generic baselines for sectors, technologies, or regions could provide economies
  of scale (Baumert, 1999). If such baselines were set by an organization independent
  from project developers, they could also provide transparency and reduce the
  potential for discrepancies between projects. The applicability of this approach
  to the LULUCF sector is unclear; no project to date has used a benchmarking
  approach. Generic baselines set by a coordinating body have been used in a few
  cases (e.g., the Protected Areas Project in Costa Rica, SGS, 1998; the Profafor
  project in Ecuador, FACE Foundation, 1998). </p>
<p>Another proposed approach involves minimum performance benchmarks (Brown, 1998).
  Minimum baselines or benchmarks could help to avoid rewarding countries or investors
  with poor practices or policies by paying for improvements over an exceedingly
  low baseline (Brown, 1998). If countries hosting LULUCF projects have policies
  that encourage carbon-emitting activities, such as subsidies for deforestation,
  LULUCF projects may only be mitigating the impact of poor policies. For instance,
  if project baselines are influenced by the threat that a particular area will
  be deforested in the absence of the project, this situation could create an
  incentive to "demonstrate" the threat of deforestation-by building roads through
  isolated areas, for example. </p>
