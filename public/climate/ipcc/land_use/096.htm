<h3>2.5.1. LULUCF Activities and Sustainable Development </h3>
<p>The Brundtland Commission has suggested that sustainable development is "development
  that satisfies the needs of the present without compromising the needs of the
  future" (Brundtland, 1987). At its core, sustainable development seeks to increase
  the flow of goods and services generated by economic activity, while maintaining
  or increasing the stock and quality of natural and human capital engaged or
  affected by the activity (Maler, 1990; Munasinghe, 1993, 2000). Because capital
  has natural and human dimensions, sustainable development reaches beyond the
  traditional emphasis on growth in aggregate income (e.g., gross national product)
  to include environmental quality and social equity (OECD, 1998; Munasinghe,
  2000). Thus, a core objective of sustainable development is to balance social,
  economic, and environmental activities and capital to improve current human
  welfare, while ensuring a sound foundation for future generations to maintain
  or improve their welfare (Solow, 1993). </p>
<p>Coincident with reducing atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentrations, LULUCF mitigation
  activities are likely to generate associated impacts that could substantially
  affect sustainable development objectives. For the purposes of this Special
  Report, these associated impacts are categorized as primarily environmental
  or primarily socioeconomic in nature, although the distinctions between the
  two categories are rarely clear-cut. Environmental consequences of LULUCF activities
  include effects on biodiversity and land and water resources. Carbon mitigation
  objectives will generally be interwoven with traditional economic and social
  factors that affect land-use decisions, such as the demand for food, fiber,
  fuel, building materials, and habitable land. As a result, LULUCF activities
  may generate socioeconomic impacts through changes in producer and consumer
  welfare, employment, poverty, and equity. If the ultimate goal of sustainable
  development is to generate the optimal mix of all (climate-related and other)
  environmental and socioeconomic benefits, tradeoffs are likely. Areas and activities
  with the greatest CO<span class="subscript">2</span> reduction benefits may not produce the optimal mix of
  non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> impacts for all stakeholders. For instance, areas with the greatest
  benefit for a given investment in carbon offsets may not always provide the
  greatest biodiversity benefits (Fearnside, 1995)-although there are several
  means by which the two objectives can be strongly linked, should the Parties
  be interested in doing so. </p>
<p>Because land-use decisions typically are driven by factors other than GHG mitigation,
  direct regulation or economic incentives often may be needed to incorporate
  carbon considerations into land-use decisions, particularly in the case of private
  lands. Land-use decisions typically are based on an assessment of costs and
  benefits that derives from consideration of a complex range of factors specific
  to each land unit; therefore, achieving global objectives relating to GHGs may
  require a mixture of regulatory and voluntary instruments. To the extent that
  economic incentives such as carbon credits compensate landowners for voluntarily
  changing their practices, those landowners can be at least as well off economically
  after the change. There are Parties other than the landowner, however, for whom
  the change in land use or management may affect their welfare either positively
  or negatively. For instance, modification of land-use or management practices
  may change employment opportunities or affect environmental quality either positively
  or negatively. Therefore, important indirect effects of LULUCF activities on
  the environment and socioeconomic welfare are likely to remain; the Parties
  may want to consider these effects in planning and implementing strategies for
  fostering LULUCF activities. </p>
<p>For the purposes of this discussion, LULUCF activities to mitigate climate
  change under the Protocol can be categorized as follows:<a href="fn3.htm#6" onClick="showFootnote(3,6); return false;"><sup>6</sup></a>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i> Activities that increase or maintain the area of land in forests</i>.
    This category relates primarily to Article 3.3 activities of afforestation,
    reforestation, and (avoided) deforestation. From a sustainable development
    perspective, there may be important differences between activities that convert
    non-forest land to forest and those that protect existing forests from conversion.
    Reducing deforestation rates can avoid significant carbon emissions (especially
    in the tropics) and reduce associated environmental and social problems. </li>
  <li><i>Activities that manage forests to store more carbon.</i> Changing the
    management of forests to store more carbon will alter the size and structure
    of forests. Although more intensive forms of management to increase tree biomass
    (e.g., more intensive efforts at regeneration, fertilization) may make more
    timber available for eventual harvest, they also may impart some negative
    consequences on other ecosystem functions. Alternatively, if current commercial
    management practices are modified to leave more biomass in the forest for
    longer periods of time (e.g., extended rotation lengths, selective logging),
    other ecosystem functions may benefit while timber production is curtailed.
  </li>
  <li><i>Activities that manage non-forested lands to store more carbon.</i> As
    an alternative to afforestation or reforestation, carbon stocks in non-forested
    lands can be increased through changes in management practices-including agricultural
    soil management, grassland management, and agroforestry. These activities
    can have strong implications for sustainable development because of their
    interconnection with food production, rural poverty, and attendant consequences
    for the environment. </li>
  <li><i> Activities that reduce dependence on fossil fuels through product substitution.</i>
    LULUCF activities can reduce dependence on fossil fuels primarily by providing
    a source of biomass that can be used as a renewable alternative to fossil
    fuels in generating energy and by supplying wood products that can substitute
    for other products requiring more energy to produce. Fossil fuel substitution
    will generally require investments in technology and infrastructure to enable
    the adoption of biofuels and less carbon-intensive products and processes.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Generalizing the impacts of LULUCF activities on sustainable development across
  activities, locations, and time, is difficult. Core environmental and socioeconomic
  aspects are discussed in the following sections. <a href="112.htm">Chapters
  3</a>, <a href="157.htm">4</a>, and <a href="246.htm">5</a> provide more detail
  on the impacts of specific activities and projects. </p>
