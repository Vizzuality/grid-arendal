<h5>2.4.2.3.4. Sampling strategy </h5>
<p>The number of soil pits or cores that must be sampled varies according to the
  topographic variation and spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of soils.
  At the large (regional/national) scale, a stratified random sample scheme is
  statistically efficient for soil data, provided that the basis for stratification
  accounts for a significant fraction of the variation in soil carbon contents.
  It is essential that the sample is accurately placed within the stratum, which
  requires the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Geographical Positioning
  Systems (GPS) or accurate field survey. For validation purposes, all sample
  locations should be geo-referenced as accurately as possible. The actual plot
  location should be marked to allow relocation of the plot reference point, for
  resampling in close proximity to prior sampling. High precision is requiring
  to avoid confounding by the high level of fine-scale variation that is common
  in soil carbon. Where an a priori randomly determined location is found to be
  inaccessible, it must be replaced with a sample having similar characteristics.
  The number of samples and the choice of location depend on the land-use and
  soil management systems. </p>
<p>At the project level, sampling strategies could be based on representative
  toposequences or catena for major land uses within the ecoregion of interest.
  The sampling strategy should be determined when the spatial distribution of
  the overlying plant community is known. Material should be collected at the
  end of each growing season (at the maximum stage of decomposition and with the
  maximum litter input), but at a minimum at the beginning and end of each commitment
  period. Uncertainty associated with differences in stock between two times can
  be substantially reduced by using paired samples; in other words, samples taken
  at time 2 should be from very close to the samples taken at time 1 and the difference
  calculated per pair, rather than on the accumulated averages (Lal <i>et al.</i>,
  2000). </p>
<h5><a name="s2-4-2-3-5"></a>2.4.2.3.5. Sampling depth </h5>
<p>Except in unusual circumstances and in peats, the amount of soil organic matter
  declines exponentially with depth (Nakane, 1976). Globally, only about one-third
  of the organic carbon in the surface 2 m is found at a depth of 1-2 m (Batjes,
  1996). Losses or accumulations of soil carbon are greatest in the upper soil
  profile (0-15 cm), which should be sampled most intensively (Richter <i>et al.</i>,
  1999). In the case of management changes on agricultural land (e.g., Smith <i>et
  al.</i>, 1997b, 1998), samples must be taken from lower in the profile because
  accumulations of carbon in the surface horizons may be balanced by losses of
  carbon at depth (Powlson and Jenkinson, 1981; Ismail <i>et al.</i>, 1994; McCarty
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Defining, a priori, a global soil depth to which carbon
  should be analyzed is not practical, however. The sampling depth should be below
  the depth that significant change in carbon is expected to occur. </p>
<p>Soil carbon changes in some situations may occur at substantial depths (e.g.,
  2-5 m in deep, tropical soils), whereas in cropped soils undergoing management
  change, almost all of the change may occur in the top 30 cm. The important issue
  is that the depth used in one inventory should match the depth used for that
  location or land-use type in the next inventory. The depth definition should
  be left open, subject to consistency between inventory times. Determining the
  effective sampling depth is not easy when the surface level is subsiding or
  aggrading (e.g., in highly organic bog soils, soils under arable agriculture,
  or soils that are subject to rapid erosion). Simultaneous measurements of bulk
  density are essential in all cases (Lal <i>et al.</i>, 2000); such measurements
  can be used to calculate an effective soil depth in mineral soils. Measuring
  soil depth as a function of mass, rather than distance from the surface, may
  be desirable because management activities may significantly change soil bulk
  density between measurements, substantially altering the amount of carbon found
  in different increments of distance from the soil surface. Failure to account
  for bulk density changes could lead to large artifacts in apparent carbon storage
  (Ellert and Bettany, 1995). In organic soils, an absolute reference level is
  required, which must be surveyed from a stable datum. </p>
