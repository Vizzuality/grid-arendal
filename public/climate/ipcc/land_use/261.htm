<h5>5.3.2.1.2. Approaches for determining baselines </h5>
<p>Most projects to date have adopted a two-step approach to determine baselines.
  First, the likely fate of terrestrial ecosystems within the project boundary
  is predicted. Second, changes in carbon stocks that would occur as a result
  of this scenario are estimated. </p>
<p>Specification of the without-project scenario for the project area usually
  have been based on projections of past trends of land use into the future. These
  predictions have taken into consideration events that are expected to alter
  current behavior (changes in legislation related to land use and tenure, changes
  in market preferences or prices, changes in environmental awareness, etc.).
  Even a thoroughly investigated without-project baseline, however, is prone to
  the risk that unexpected social or policy changes will confound predictions
  over the longer time frame. For example, the baseline for a reduced-impact logging
  project could change radically if national policy dictated adoption of this
  practice in all forest concessions. Key factors used in projecting the baselines
  have included planned land-use decisions of landowners/stakeholders, designation
  of land by national authorities, and historical patterns of land-use change
  in the local area. </p>
<p>Different approaches likely would be required, however, for different types
  of projects operating in different circumstances: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Afforestation projects might use simple models that predict zero uptake/emissions
    without intervention.</li>
  <li>Projects to conserve forests used by small farmers are likely to need models
    that reflect local demands for agricultural land, firewood, and timber.</li>
  <li>Projects aiming to reduce emissions through better forest management may
    need models that compare technological alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different approaches for data collection have been used, including compilations
  of national/regional statistics, satellite imagery, and interviews with relevant
  authorities and key stakeholders. There is debate about the level of detail
  required and the weight given to different criteria (historical trends, available
  technology, population pressure, etc.) (Busch <i>et al.</i>, 1999).</p>
<p>Several approaches have been proposed and/or used during the AIJ Pilot Phase
  for deciding how to carry out baseline projections. These approaches vary with
  regard to data requirements and treatment: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Simple, logical arguments</i> do not use quantitative methods for predicting
    changes in current trends (or use simple ones). For example: "Without intervention,
    the forest concerned will be sold for agricultural development" [Rio Bravo
    project (Programme for Belize, 1997a)] or "without intervention, loss of aboveground
    carbon stocks within the area will continue at approximately 1.5 percent per
    year" [Scolel T� pilot project (Tipper <i>et al.</i>, 1998); see also <a href="#box5-2">Box
    5-2</a>]. Variations of this approach have been used by most projects during
    the AIJ Pilot Phase [e.g., the NKCAP in Bolivia (Brown <i>et al.</i>, 2000);
    the RIL project in Sabah, Malaysia (Pinard and Putz, 1997); the PAP in Costa
    Rica (SGS, 1998)].</li>
  <li><i>Spatial or social-economic models</i> simulate land-use change processes
    on the basis of factors such as proximity of towns, roads, and agricultural
    frontiers; population growth; food requirements; and the productivity of local
    agricultural technology [e.g., LUCS model (Faeth <i>et al.</i>, 1994); Ludeke,
    1990; Jepma, 1995). This approach is being used in The Nature Conservancy's
    project in Guaraque�aba, Brazil (Brown <i>et al.</i>, 1999a,b).</li>
  <li><i>Econometric models</i> use an econometric treatment to data factors such
    as historical series of productivity, price, costs, and so forth. This approach
    has not been used in the AIJ Pilot Phase, but it has been discussed in a few
    publications (e.g., Chomitz, 1998).</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple, logical arguments are not necessarily less accurate in terms of predictive
  ability. Their applicability will probably be limited, however, to specific
  areas and contexts. Increasing model complexity is likely to be required to
  attempt credible predictions across a range of land uses. Such models, however,
  generally require large amounts of input data and may still be poor predictors
  of specific local changes. Requirements for complex baseline models could represent
  a serious barrier to small-scale projects or initiatives in poorer countries
  unless "umbrella" approaches are adopted (Bass <i>et al.</i>, 2000). Procedures
  for selection or approval of models and a program for model testing and improvement
  to ensure some degree of consistency and quality would have to be considered.

	  used to estimate changes in land use between 12 categories of vegetation/land
	  use for an area of approximately 300,000 ha in the highlands of Chiapas.
	  Measurements of the biomass of each vegetation type were then used to
	  derive an estimate of the change in carbon stocks. Extrapolation of
	  the historical changes of carbon stocks into the future can be used
	  as a basis for without-project baselines. Because the rate of land-use
	  change varied considerably over the 1974 to 1996 period, however, so
	  did the baseline rate of carbon loss over the time period chosen as
	  the reference. The spatial frame of reference used to derive estimates
	  of land-use change is also important. Deforestation activity is often
	  concentrated in particular areas (e.g., along roads and river valleys).
	  The historical rate of change may therefore vary considerably according
	  to the geographical coordinates of the reference area.</div>

<p>Once a baseline scenario for land-use and ecosystem changes has been developed,
  changes in carbon stocks associated with this scenario must be estimated. Different
  approaches have been used or proposed during the AIJ Pilot Phase (see examples
  in <a href="259.htm#table5-4">Table 5-4</a>), including the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Quantification of carbon in proxy areas [e.g., the NKCAP (Brown <i>et al.</i>,
    2000)]</li>
  <li>Control plots where project activities are not applied, which are set aside
    for measurement of carbon stocks in the absence of the project intervention
    [e.g., the RIL project in Sabah, Malaysia (Pinard and Putz, 1997)]</li>
  <li>Modeling [e.g., the PAP in Costa Rica (SGS, 1998)]</li>
  <li>Combinations of the foregoing approaches.</li>
