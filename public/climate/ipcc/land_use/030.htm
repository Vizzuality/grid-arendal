<h4>1.3.2.4. Nutrient Deposition and Mineralization </h4>
<p>Production in the forests of the world, with the exception of lowland tropical
  forests (Vitousek and Sanford, 1986), is generally restricted by lack of nitrogen,
  particularly in northern temperate and boreal regions (Vitousek and Howarth,
  1991), or lack of phosphorus, in the tropics (Lloyd<i> et al.</i>, n.d.). Nitrogen
  fertilization is an efficient means for enhancing agricultural production and
  is very effective in enhancing the productivity of forest plantations in Mediterranean,
  temperate, and boreal climatic regions (e.g., McMurtrie and Landsberg, 1992;
  Linder <i>et al.</i>, 1996). Addition of nitrogen and phosphorus promotes the
  activity of photosynthesis per leaf, and nitrogen in particular stimulates increases
  in the number and growth of leaves, increasing the area of leaves in vegetation
  canopies. Many experiments worldwide have demonstrated that the growth of temperate
  forests is very responsive to the application of fertilizers, particularly of
  nitrogen (Linder and Rook, 1984; Tamm, 1991). For example, recent long-term
  experiments have shown a four-fold increase in the growth of Norway spruce in
  response to annual, complete fertilizer applications (75 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) at
  64�N over the past 12 years and a doubling of growth at 57�N over the past 10
  years (Linder, 1995; Bergh <i>et al.</i>, 1999). Maritime commercial spruce
  forest is also responsive to applications of nitrogen (Taylor and Tabbush, 1990;
  Wang <i>et al.</i>, 1991). Comparable information from tropical forests is not
  readily available. The additional growth of vegetation may also lead to an increase
  in the amount of organic matter in the soil-or at least minimize the decrease
  brought about by tillage, harvesting, and other agricultural and forestry management
  practices. </p>
<p>Inventory data from sample plots indicate that the growth of trees has been
  increasing across Europe (Spiecker <i>et al.</i>, 1996), and these trends have
  been observed elsewhere. Wet and dry deposition of nutrients from the atmosphere
  may be contributing to this enhancement of forest growth. In general, annual
  total (wet and dry) deposition of nitrogen (oxidized and reduced) to forests
  in rural areas is in the range of 5 to 40 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>; the smaller amounts
  are in more remote forests, particularly at high latitudes and in the tropics
  (e.g., Forti and Moreira-Nordemann, 1991; Eklund <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Freydier
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998). Larger amounts are deposited on forests close to cities
  and industrial centers from which there are substantial nitrogen emissions,
  as well as in the near vicinity of intensive agricultural pig and poultry enterprises;
  this deposition may lead to problems such as acidification and loss of biodiversity.
  It is likely that such nitrogen inputs are supporting additional growth of young
  forests of particular relevance to the Kyoto forests and hence carbon sequestration
  (see <a href="033.htm">Section 1.4</a>; Cannell <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Valentini
  <i>et al.</i>, 2000), although recently this effect has been disputed (Nadelhoffer
  <i>et al.</i>, 1999). A key uncertainty is to what extent and for how long the
  current annual rate of nitrogen deposition can sustain the growth rate and NEP
  of forests on Kyoto lands. </p>
