<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) activities aimed at mitigating
  greenhouse gas emissions are often organized as projects. An LULUCF project
  may integrate one or more activities aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions
  or enhancing greenhouse gas sinks in terrestrial ecosystems and related sectors.
  LULUCF projects are confined to a specific geographic location, time period,
  and institutional framework to allow changes in carbon stocks or greenhouse
  gas emissions to be monitored and verified. There are three broad types of LULUCF
  projects: (i) avoiding emissions via conservation of existing carbon stocks,
  (ii) increasing carbon storage by sequestration, and (iii) substituting carbon
  for fossil fuel and energy-intensive products. Each of these types of project
  has a variety of subtypes. Integrated multi-component projects may combine many
  of these subtypes. </p>
<p>LULUCF projects have raised specific concerns regarding duration, additionality,
  leakage, risks, accounting, measuring and monitoring, and verification of greenhouse
  gas benefits. These concerns include the ability to construct reasonable, empirically
  based, without-project baselines; the ability to quantify and reduce potential
  leakage of greenhouse gases across project borders to other areas or markets;
  and the ability to cope with natural or human-induced risks that may reduce
  or eliminate accrued greenhouse gas benefits. Many of these issues are also
  applicable to climate mitigation projects in other sectors. There are further
  questions about the degree to which projects can be designed to contribute to
  sustainable development and improved rural livelihoods. This chapter addresses
  each of these concerns. </p>
<p>Assessment of the experience of LULUCF projects is constrained by the small
  number of such projects, their limited activity and geographic scope, and the
  short period of field operations since the first greenhouse gas mitigation project
  began in 1988. About 3.5 Mha of land are currently included in 27 LULUCF greenhouse
  gas mitigation projects being implemented in 19 countries. In addition, LULUCF
  project experience to date has focused only on mitigating carbon (as carbon
  dioxide) emissions. </p>
<p>Because no internationally agreed set of guidelines or methods yet exists to
  quantify carbon benefits, costs, and the carbon and financial efficiency of
  project activities, projects have used a wide range of methods to estimate changes
  in carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions and financial indicators. Few of
  the results of these projects have been independently verified, which makes
  comparative assessments difficult. Using data reported by projects that have
  been reviewed, average carbon sequestration or emissions avoidance per unit
  area ranges from about 4-440 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>; there is wide variation across regions
  and specific project types. The cost of greenhouse gas mitigation effects in
  these projects ranges from $0.1-28 per t C, based on dividing the total financial
  commitment by the estimated long-term greenhouse gas mitigation effect. </p>
<p>A fundamental component of project assessment is to determine whether changes
  in carbon stocks or greenhouse gas emissions associated with a project are "additional"
  to "business as usual." The first step in determining additionality has been
  to develop a without-project (baseline) scenario against which carbon stocks
  in the project can be compared. Currently there is no standard method for developing
  baselines. Approaches for developing and applying baselines include: <i>project
  specific</i>, established through a case-by-case exercise, or <i>generic</i>-based
  on regional, national, or sectoral aggregated data. These baselines may remain
  fixed throughout the duration of a project, or they may be periodically adjusted
  in light of new data or evidence. Methods to quantify (or estimate) carbon stocks
  in the baseline scenario include the use of models to project the fate of land
  in the project area in combination with data on carbon stocks from proxy or
  control areas or from the literature. </p>
<p>Experience shows that reducing access to food or fiber resources without offering
  alternatives or substituting for the activity leading to greenhouse gas emissions
  may result in project leakage as people move elsewhere to find needed supplies.
  A few pilot projects to date have been designed to reduce leakage by explicitly
  incorporating components that supply the resource needs of local communities
  (e.g., planting fuelwood plantations to reduce pressures on other forests) and
  provide socioeconomic benefits that create incentives to maintain the project.
</p>
<p>Project accounting and monitoring methods could be matched with project conditions
  to address leakage issues. For example, if flows of LULUCF products or people
  across project boundaries are negligible, leakage is likely to be small, and
  the monitoring area can be roughly equal to the project area. Conversely, where
  flows are significant and leakage is likely to be large, the monitoring area
  will need to be expanded beyond the project area to account for the leakage.
  Alternative approaches for accounting and monitoring leakage may be required
  where monitoring and project areas cannot be easily matched. Potential options
  include national or regional LULUCF sectoral benchmarks (empirically derived
  values that relate leakage levels to activities and/or regions) that could capture
  and report leakage outside the project area, and standard risk coefficients
  developed by project or activity type and region, with adjustments to project
  greenhouse gas benefits made accordingly. However, the effectiveness of these
  approaches is untested. </p>
<p>Implementation of projects in countries without assigned amounts for national
  emissions presents specific concerns regarding baselines, greenhouse gas accounting,
  leakage, and monitoring. Unlike Annex I countries, non-Annex I countries are
  not required to account for emissions on a national level. Therefore, leakage
  and emissions arising after the project has been completed will not be detected.
