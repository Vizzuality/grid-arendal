<h4>3.3.2.7. How Can Carbon Accounting of ARD Land during Future Commitment Periods
  Be Carried Out? </h4>
<p>Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol is specific in that the allowable offsets
  from ARD activities must be "measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks
  in each commitment period." Once a piece of land falls under the definitions
  of Article 3.3 during one commitment period, can it subsequently be removed
  from the accounting? It is logical to assume that land could change from the
  deforestation category to reforestation or vice versa. If a piece of land can
  be removed from the ARD lands category at later times (e.g., when the activity
  ends in an activity-based approach), large carbon stocks that were credited
  previously could be released without debits (Schlamadinger and Marland, 1998).
  The words "in each commitment period" in Article 3.3 suggest a reporting requirement
  for future commitment periods. Over time, the area of ARD land would increase
  because no land can be removed from this classification. </p>
<p>The inclusion of afforestation and reforestation since 1990 provides countries
  with an additional tool for achieving their assigned carbon emission targets
  during the first commitment period because most forests established since 1990
  would still be growing rapidly in 2012. If the Kyoto Protocol were applied to
  future, contiguous commitment periods and if more and more post-1990 forests
  were harvested during these periods, credits would be followed by debits on
  the stand level (see also <a href="129.htm">Section 3.3.2.3</a> on ways to limit
  such debits). On the national level, however, credits would only decrease over
  time as the forest estate approaches a biomass equilibrium. Carbon trends in
  these future commitment periods will partly depend on the definitions of stocks
  (see <a href="072.htm">Section 2.3.6</a>). On-site carbon stocks in post-1990
  forests are likely to increase for decades (provided the total area of eligible
  forests does not decrease over time and forests are logged on a sustainable-yield
  basis). However, the rate of increase-hence the amount of allowable offsets-is
  likely to diminish over time. </p>
