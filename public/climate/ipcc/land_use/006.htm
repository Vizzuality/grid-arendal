<h4>4. Carbon Acounting </h4>
<ol start="31">
  <li>A well-designed carbon accounting system would provide transparent, consistent,
    comparable, complete, accurate, verifiable, and efficient recording and reporting
    of changes in carbon stocks and/or changes in greenhouse gas emissions by
    sources and removals by sinks from applicable land use, land-use change, and
    forestry activities and projects under relevant Articles of the Kyoto Protocol.
    Such data would be needed to assess compliance with the commitments under
    the Kyoto Protocol. Two possible accounting approaches towards meeting these
    requirements are outlined below, of which either one-or combination of the
    two-could be adopted (see <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>). [<a href="059.htm#s2-3-1">2.3.1</a>]
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A "land-based" approach to accounting would take as its starting point the
    change in carbon stock in applicable carbon pools on lands containing activities
    included under Article 3.3 or accepted under Article 3.4. This involves first
    defining the applicable activities, and in the next step identifying the land
    units on which these activities occur. Next, the change in carbon stocks on
    these land units during the relevant period is determined. In the land-based
    approach, it could be difficult to factor out the impact on stocks of indirect
    effects (see paragraph 44). Non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> greenhouse gas emission estimates would
    also need to be accounted for. Modifications could be made regarding, for
    example, baselines, leakage, timing issues, permanence, and uncertainties.
    Aggregate accounted CO<span class="subscript">2</span> emissions and removals are the sum of carbon stock
    changes (net of any modifications) over all applicable land units over the
    specified time period. [<a href="061.htm">2.3.2</a>, <a href="126.htm">3.3.2</a>]</li>

    <br>
  <li>An "activity-based" approach to accounting would start with the carbon stock
    change in applicable carbon pools and/or emissions/removal of greenhouse gases
    attributable to designated LULUCF activities. After defining the applicable
    activities, each applicable activity's impact on carbon stocks is determined
    per unit area and time unit. This impact is multiplied by the area on which
    each activity occurs and by the years it is applied or the years of the commitment
    period. Modifications could be made regarding, for example, baselines, leakage,
    timing issues, permanence, and uncertainties. Aggregate accounted emissions
    and removals are calculated by summing across applicable activities. Potentially
    a given area of land could be counted more than once if it is subject to multiple
    activities. If the effects of activities are not additive, this would result
    in inaccurate accounting. In this case, the carbon stock would be especially
    difficult to verify. Alternatively the Parties could decide that each land
    unit could contain no more than a single activity. In this case, the combined
    impact of multiple practices applied in the same area would be considered
    a single activity. [<a href="061.htm">2.3.2</a>, <a href="126.htm">3.3.2</a>,
    <a href="168.htm">4.3.3</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The land-based approach to accounting could start either with the start
    of the activity or run for the entire commitment period, while the activity-based
    approach would start when the activity starts or at the beginning of the commitment
    period, whichever is later. Either accounting approach could end according
    to decisions that the Parties might adopt. In the activity-based approach,
    stock changes prior to the start of the activity would not be accounted, even
    if they occur in a commitment period. [<a href="061.htm">2.3.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Some activities must be persistently maintained to retain the stored carbon
    stocks, and this may influence the accounting methods required. Conservation
    tillage, for example, may increase carbon stocks on cropland if carried on
    continuously, but where it is practiced for a time, then interrupted by a
    year of intensive tillage brought on by, for example, a weather situation
    or crop change, much of the previous multi-year gain in soil carbon can be
    lost. Land-based estimates of the cropland estate should reflect the net effect
    of those gains and losses over the full area during the accounting period
    and give verifiable results, provided statistically representative sampling
    procedures are in place. If activity-based accounting occurs without sampling,
    it may report results inconsistent with actual stock changes during the accounting
    period. [<a href="061.htm">2.3.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>For technical reasons, only emissions and removals of CO<span class="subscript">2</span> can be determined
    directly as changes in carbon stocks. Methane emissions and removals cannot
    in practice be directly measured as carbon stock changes, although CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and
    N<span class="subscript">2</span>O can be determined by other means. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions
    from many land-use activities are included in Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol
    (e.g., rice cultivation, enteric fermentation, and agricultural soils) and
    in the Revised 1996 IPCC Reporting Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
    Inventories, and therefore they will be captured in national inventories.
    This is not the case, however, for emissions of these gases related to forestry
    activities and projects, which are not included in Annex A, although some
    of these forestry activities are discussed in the 1996 Revised IPCC Guidelines
    for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. If the net emissions of CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and N<span class="subscript">2</span>O
    are not considered, the full climate impact of forestry activities may not
    be reflected in the accounting system under the Kyoto Protocol. The treatment
    of CH<span class="subscript">4</span> and N<span class="subscript">2</span>O emissions under Article 3.3 may deserve further consideration
    and clarification. For agreed activities, Article 3.4 leaves open how net
    greenhouse gas emissions will be accounted for in meeting the commitments
    under Article 3.1 of the Protocol. [<a href="061.htm">2.3.2</a>, <a href="126.htm">3.3.2</a>]
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> Relevant carbon pools could include aboveground biomass, litter and woody
    debris, below-ground biomass, soil carbon, and harvested materials. The impact
    on these different carbon pools may vary significantly between activities
    and types of projects. While methods exist to measure all carbon pools, to
    date monitoring is not routinely performed on all pools and the costs vary
    significantly. A conservative approach that would allow for selective accounting
    of carbon pools to reduce monitoring costs could be to include all those pools
    anticipated to have reduced carbon stocks while omitting selected pools anticipated,
    with a sufficient level of certainty, to have unchanged or increased carbon
    stocks. Similar approaches could be used for fluxes of non-CO<span class="subscript">2</span> greenhouse
    gases. Under this approach, verifiability would mean that only increases in
    carbon stocks and removal by sinks that can be monitored and estimated could
    potentially be credited. [<a href="076.htm">2.3.7</a>, <a href="126.htm">3.3.2</a>,
    <a href="161.htm#s4-2-1">4.2.1</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Accounting for LULUCF activities under Articles 3.3 and 3.4 includes different
    types of uncertainties, including measurement uncertainty, uncertainty in
    identifying lands under Article 3.3 or 3.4, and uncertainty in defining and
    quantifying baselines, if any. This uncertainty can be accounted for in several
    ways. One approach is to extend the application of good practice guidance
    in the choice of methods and handling of uncertainty in estimates which has
    been developed by the IPCC for other inventory categories. Another approach
    could be to adjust estimated stock changes in a conservative way-understating
    increases and overstating decreases in stocks. The latter option could allow
    tradeoffs between monitoring costs and the potential to receive increased
    carbon credits or reduced debits, but would not be consistent with established
    principles for estimation of emissions and removals in greenhouse gas inventories.
    [<a href="076.htm">2.3.7</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Changes in carbon stocks in wood products could potentially be accounted
    as part of the activity that is the source of the wood products or as an independent
    wood products management activity. If management of wood products is treated
    as an additional activity under Article 3.4, then it may be necessary to exclude
    wood products from accounting under other Article 3.3 or 3.4 activities to
    avoid double-counting. Once wood products are in trade, they would be difficult
    in most instances to trace. The current IPCC default approach assumes that
    the wood product pool remains constant over time, and therefore does not account
    for it. However, if this pool is changing significantly over time, a potentially
    important pool may not be accounted for. [<a href="079.htm">2.4.2</a>, <a href="126.htm">3.3.2</a>,
    <a href="209.htm">4.5.6</a>, <a href="309.htm#s6-3-3">6.3.3</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Enhancement of carbon stocks resulting from land use, land-use change, and
    forestry activities is potentially reversible through human activities, disturbances,
    or environmental change, including climate change. This potential reversibility
    is a characteristic feature of LULUCF activities in contrast to activities
    in other sectors. This potential reversibility and nonpermanence of stocks
    may require attention with respect to accounting, for example, by ensuring
    that any credit for enhanced carbon stocks is balanced by accounting for any
    subsequent reductions in those carbon stocks, regardless of the cause. [<a href="072.htm">2.3.6</a>,
    <a href="126.htm">3.3.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Contiguous commitment periods under the Kyoto Protocol would avoid incentives
    in subsequent periods to concentrate activities that reduce carbon stocks
    in time periods that were not covered. [<a href="061.htm">2.3.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Policies by governments or other institutions (e.g., land tenure reform
    and tax incentives) may provide a framework and incentives for implementing
    LULUCF activities. Changes in markets may also affect the economic conditions
    for land use, land-use change, and forestry activities. The ability to measure
    the impact of these conditions and incentives will depend, in part, upon the
    carbon inventory and monitoring system in each country. However, it may be
    very difficult for countries to assess the relative impact of policies by
    governments or other institutions compared to other human and natural factors
    that drive changes in carbon stocks. [<a href="070.htm">2.3.5</a>, <a href="253.htm">5.2.2</a>]
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Natural variability, such as El Niño cycles, and the indirect effects of
    human activity, such as CO<span class="subscript">2</span> fertilization, nutrient deposition, and the effects
    of climate change, could significantly affect carbon stocks during a commitment
    period on lands under Article 3.3 or 3.4. The spatial distribution of the
    emissions and removals of greenhouse gases due to these factors is uncertain,
    as is the portion of them that may enter the accounting system. These emissions
    and removals could be potentially large compared to the commitments in the
    first commitment period. This could be a significant issue in the design of
    an accounting framework. [<a href="065.htm">2.3.3</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The Kyoto Protocol specifies that accounting under Article 3.3 be restricted
    to "direct human-induced land-use change and forestry activities, limited
    to afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation" occurring since 1990.
    For activities that involve land-use changes (e.g., from grassland/ pasture
    to forest) it may be very difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish with
    present scientific tools that portion of the observed stock change that is
    directly human-induced from that portion that is caused by indirect and natural
    factors. [<a href="067.htm">2.3.4</a>, <a href="126.htm">3.3.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>For those activities where only narrowly defined management changes under
    Article 3.4 are involved (e.g., conservation tillage) and the land use remains
    the same, it may be feasible to partially factor out natural variability and
    indirect effects. One approach may be to subtract the stock changes on comparison
    plots where there have been no changes in management practice from changes
    measured on plots with modified management activities. In most cases experimental
    manipulation or paired plots can be used for this purpose, but they are likely
    to be expensive to apply over large areas. Ecosystem models can also be used
    but need further improvement to decrease uncertainties. Verifiability could
    be assisted by the application of a combination of models and measurements.
    [<a href="067.htm">2.3.4</a>, <a href="169.htm">4.3.4</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Baselines could be used in some cases to distinguish between the effects
    of LULUCF activities and other factors, such as natural variability and the
    indirect effects of human activities, as well as to factor out the effects
    of business-as-usual and activities undertaken prior to 1990 on carbon stock
    accounts and net greenhouse gas emissions. If the concept of a baseline was
    to be applied in national accounting for activities under Article 3.4, there
    are many options, which include: (i) the stock/flux change that would have
    resulted from "business-as-usual" activities; (ii) the stock/flux change that
    would have resulted from the continuation of 1990 activity levels; (iii) the
    stock/flux change that would result in the absence of active management; (iv)
    performance benchmarks or standard management practice; and (v) the rate of
    change of stocks/fluxes in 1990. The first three of these baseline options
    may involve the use of a counterfactual scenario. One difficulty with the
    use of counterfactual baselines is verification. [<a href="067.htm">2.3.4</a>,
    <a href="211.htm">4.6</a>, <a href="216.htm">4.6.3.3</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Accounting under the terms land-use change and forestry in Article 3.7 will
    determine which emissions and removals of carbon will enter the 1990 base
    year or period for some countries. If the land-use change activities giving
    rise to these emissions and removals are not included under Article 3.3 or
    3.4 during the commitment periods, then the inventories of countries subject
    to this clause in Article 3.7 would not be calculated on the same basis as
    their 1990 emissions base year or period. [<a href="126.htm">3.3.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>If different accounting rules are adopted for relevant Articles of the Kyoto
    Protocol, additional decision rules may be needed to determine which accounting
    rule applies to land that, over time, is subject to multiple types of activities.
    For example, one set of accounting rules could be given primacy in cases where
    more than one set could potentially apply and double-counting might result.
    [<a href="061.htm">2.3.2</a>, <a href="126.htm">3.3.2</a>] <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Leakage is changes in emissions and removals of greenhouse gases outside
    the accounting system that result from activities that cause changes within
    the boundary of the accounting system. There are four types of leakage: activity
    displacement, demand displacement, supply displacement, and investment crowding.
    If leakage occurs, then the accounting system will fail to give a complete
    assessment of the true aggregate changes induced by the activity. Although
    leakage is in many cases a negative effect, situations, such as the demonstration
    effect of new management approaches or technology adoption, may occur where
    the emissions reductions or removals of greenhouse gases extend beyond the
    accounting system boundaries (positive spillover effect). For some activities
    and project types, leakage may be addressed by increasing the spatial and
    temporal scale of the accounting system boundaries (i.e., by including areas
    where changes in removal and emissions of greenhouse gases may be induced).
    However, leakage may extend beyond any activity accounting boundaries (e.g.,
    beyond national boundaries). Leakage is of particular concern in project-level
    accounting, but may also occur with activities under Articles 3.3 and 3.4.
