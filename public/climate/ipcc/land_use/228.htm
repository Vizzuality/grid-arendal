<h3 align="center">Fact Sheet 4.5. Management of Rice Cultivation </h3>
<p>Management strategies for rice include irrigation, fertilization, and crop
  residue management. Rice agriculture is an important source of methane globally;
  hence, changes in methane emissions likely dominate the overall GHG effect of
  riceland agriculture on short time horizons (<100 years). Little information
  is available on carbon stock changes associated with rice paddy management.
  Rice agriculture tends to increase soil carbon stocks in comparison with adjacent
  areas without rice. Most practices that reduce methane emissions will likely
  also reduce the rate of carbon storage in rice paddy soils, however. </p>
<p><b>Use and Potential </b></p>
<p><b><i>Changes in Soil Carbon Stocks under Rice Management </i></b><br>
  Increases in organic matter have been observed in paddy field soils that have
  been in cultivation for 30-100 years in Japan and China. Organic matter may
  increase in the plow layer by 40-50 percent through rice cultivation and triple
  in other paddy soils compared with adjacent unflooded arable soils. In deeper
  soil horizons, increases have been shown to be small (Mitsuchi, 1974). Measurements
  of annual carbon balance made between May 1991 and April 1997 showed uptake
  of 0.27-0.32 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> for an upland single-cropping field, 0.16-0.27 C ha<sup>-1</sup>
  for an upland double-cropping field, and only 0.02 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> for a paddy rice
  single-cropping field in Japan (Koizumi <i>et al.</i>, 1998). These rates agree
  with long-term rates observed over decades to a century of rice cultivation.
</p>
<p>Addition of fertilizers, including manure (Wada <i>et al.</i>, 1981; Wada,
  1984), plant residues, and chemical amendments (Kimura <i>et al.</i>, 1980)
  increase carbon storage. Storage of 7-26 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> was observed for 28 to 53
  years of manure application in central and southern Japan (average of 0.25-0.5
  t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). Many researchers have demonstrated that incorporation of rice
  straw and green manure into rice paddy soils dramatically increases methane
  emissions. Yagi et al. (1997) showed that incorporation of rice straw in soil
  at rates of 600-900 g m<sup>-2</sup> after previous harvest increased methane emission
  rates up to 3.5-fold in Japanese rice paddy fields; application of rice straw
  compost slightly increased methane emissions (Yagi and Minami, 1990). </p>
<p><b><i>Strategies to Reduce Methane Emissions </i></b><br>
  Strategies to reduce methane emissions from rice cultivation include changes
  in water management, fertilizer application, and chemical additions. Water management
  strategies include midseason drainage (Yagi and Minami, 1990; Yagi <i>et al.</i>,
  1996) and intermittent irrigation (Sass <i>et al.</i>, 1992; Chen <i>et al.</i>,
  1993; Cai <i>et al.</i>, 1994). Chemical additions (e.g., sulfate or iron) decrease
  the activity of methanogens by providing alternative electron acceptors and
  restricting the availability of substrates in submerged soils (e.g., Hori <i>et
  al.</i>, 1990). Treatments with sulfate have reduced overall methane emissions
  by 20-77 percent in different experiments (Schutz <i>et al.</i>, 1989; Lindau
  <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Denier van der Gon and Neue, 1994). The effect may depend
  on the amount applied, however: Wassmann <i>et al.</i> (1993) reported no effect
  from sulfate addition to fields in China. Other chemical amendments have included
  nitrate (Kitada <i>et al.</i>, 1993-reduced emissions 23 percent), thiourea
  (Cai <i>et al.</i>, 1994-no effect), and calcium carbide (Bronson and Mosier,
  1991-large reduction). Other options for reducing methane emissions include
  changes in tillage and selection of rice cultivars that are associated with
  lower methane emissions (Yagi <i>et al.</i>, 1997). </p>
<p>Mosier <i>et al.</i> (1998) estimate the potential to reduce methane emissions
  by 8-35 Mt CH<span class="subscript">4</span> yr<sup>-1</sup> [total emissions estimated at 10-113 Mt CH<span class="subscript">4</span> yr<sup>-1</sup> (Minami,
  1994)] if practices were applied in all amenable areas. This reduction is equivalent
  to reducing carbon emissions by 0.04-0.2 Gt C. By comparison, the global potential
  for GHG reduction through carbon storage in rice paddy soils is small: Storage
  at a rate of 0.25 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> over 30 percent of the total rice area (140
  Mha) would remove 0.01 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>-equivalent to a reduction of about 1 Mt CH<span class="subscript">4</span>
  yr<sup>-1</sup> globally. Carbon storage likely would actually decrease under most of the
  management practices for methane reduction, decreasing the net GHG effect from
  that determined from methane emissions reduction alone. </p>
<p><b>Scientific Uncertainties </b><br>
  There are large uncertainties regarding the area amenable to various rice cultivation
  practices, and very few data exist on the rates of carbon accumulation or loss
  and methane emission changes under these practices. The large range in estimates
  of global methane sources associated with rice cultivation illustrate the large
  uncertainties associated with extrapolation of methane emissions data over larger
  land areas. </p>
<p><b>Time Scales </b><br>
  Data from areas where rice agriculture has been practiced continuously for a
  century or more show that gains in soil carbon are long term (>100 years). Increased
  drainage to decrease methane emissions may increase decomposition rates dramatically,
  however, if the soil changes from largely anaerobic to aerobic conditions. </p>
<p><b>Monitoring, Verifiability, and Transparency </b><br>
  Measurement of methane fluxes is technically challenging and expensive, although
  several models now attempt to predict methane emissions from rice. Because methane
  fluxes are highly variable in space and time, monitoring of methane emissions
  involves significant effort and cost. Changes in carbon storage may be monitored
  as changes in bulk density and percent carbon, as discussed in <a href="112.htm">Chapter
  3</a>. </p>
<p><b>Permanence</b><br>
  Carbon storage depends on the degree to which the soil remains anaerobic as
  opposed to aerobic. Permanence of carbon storage therefore depends on the duration
  of the cultivation practice. On long time horizons (>100 years), carbon storage
  changes will dominate changes in methane because of the short atmospheric lifetime
  of methane. </p>
<p><b>Associated Impacts </b><br>
  Rice is a major world food crop. The impact of management strategies on costs
  to farmers and on rice yield and sustainability has yet to be assessed. Very
  few data are available on nitrous oxide emissions and how they will be affected
  by various management strategies. </p>
