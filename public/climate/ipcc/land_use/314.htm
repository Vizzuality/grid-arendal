<h3>6.5.1. Elements of Reporting </h3>
<p><i>Article 3.3.</i> If all carbon pools are to be included when ARD activities 
  are reported, it would be helpful to provide accounting methods in the Guidelines 
  for pools other than aboveground biomass and soil carbon. If methods other than 
  those in the Guidelines are used, a description of the methods of measurement 
  and analysis would improve transparency. If ARD activities have to be reported 
  separately, reporting guidelines will have to be improved. For pools that the 
  Guidelines already deal with, refinements may also be required to better reflect 
  nonlinear decay processes in the soil, for example. Priority could be given 
  to improving methods for carbon pools that undergo significant changes in carbon 
  stocks, as well as pools that are to be used in assessing compliance with commitments. 
  For improved transparency and verifiability, reporting for ARD may need to be 
  geo-referenced. </p>
<p><i>Article 3.4.</i> Reporting of additional activities could be similar to 
  reporting of ARD. As before, the key decisions are generic-for example, the 
  issue of comprehensive accounting for GHG. Unlike Article 3.3, however, potential 
  activities under Article 3.4 are not yet defined by the FCCC. This circumstance 
  limits the extent of the discussion here. Most broadly defined, however, additional 
  activities (FCCC, 1998a) can be accounted by the Guidelines. The definitions 
  of some narrowly defined activities might need to be clarified. </p>
<p><i>Articles 6 and 12.</i> The Guidelines were not designed for reporting of 
  projects, and the degree of their improvement would depend on their use. At 
  a minimum, reporting of a summary of changes in net GHG emissions and removals 
  from all projects may be all that Parties decide is required. If so, this option 
  would be relatively easy to operationalize. If a complete record of carbon impacts 
  of each individual project is required, however, the level of effort to develop 
  such guidelines could be considerable. Similarly, developing guidelines to estimate 
  environmental and socioeconomic impacts may be equally involved. Whichever options 
  are chosen, the factors to be considered include baselines, carbon stocks conserved 
  or changed, GHG emissions and removals, system boundaries, leakage, positive 
  spillover, reporting for monitoring of different activities, identification 
  of carbon stock changes for different years, and frequency of measurements and 
  reporting. The level of accuracy required for projects is generally higher than 
  that for national inventories, so the reporting requirements for verification 
  and monitoring are likely to differ from those for national inventories. For 
  each of the options identified above, a key decision is whether Parties could 
  choose their own accounting methods or whether internationally agreed methods 
  would be stipulated for reporting-and if so, for which of the foregoing issues. 
  <br>
  Although the reporting needs of the Protocol differ significantly at the project 
  and national levels, several generic issues apply. A key decision that could 
  apply to several Articles in the Protocol is the treatment of wood products. 
  Parties would need to indicate priorities before work could begin to improve 
  the Guidelines, if at all. Some unranked options are included in 
  <a href="314.htm#tab65">Table 6-5</a>.
