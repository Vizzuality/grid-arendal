<h4>4.4.5.1. Forest Regeneration </h4>
<p>Forest regeneration generally is done promptly after the previous stand or
  forest has been removed. The method (natural regeneration, artificial planting,
  seeding), species, and density are chosen to meet landowner goals. Forest regeneration
  includes activities such as changing tree density through human-assisted natural
  regeneration; enrichment planting; reduced grazing of savanna woodlands; and
  better matching of tree provenances, genetic strains, or species to soils and
  sites. "Human-assisted natural regeneration" is establishment of a forest age
  class from natural seeding or sprouting after activities such as selection cutting,
  shelter (or seed-tree) harvest, soil preparation, or restricting the size of
  a clear-felling stand to secure natural regeneration from surrounding trees.
  "Enrichment planting" is inter-planting additional trees in an existing forest
  stand. </p>
<p>Forest regeneration influences on-site carbon stocks by accelerating the return
  of a growing forest after harvest, altering growth rates of aboveground and
  below-ground tree biomass through better species selection, and changing the
  potential mix of final wood products. The impacts on the litter layer and soil
  vary with many factors. Generally, over the rotation period, the annual increase
  of carbon in tree biomass is much higher than the additions to soil or litter
  carbon. Where normal forest management activities (e.g., careful harvest followed
  by rapid regeneration) are carried out, it is generally thought that soil carbon
  stocks do not change significantly from rotation to rotation. </p>
<p>The connection between forest regeneration and the end use of wood is an important
  consideration in full accounting of carbon stocks. For example, a higher tree
  density may not be the best option for carbon sequestration. High densities
  may lead to rapid crown closure and early growth, but crowded stands often suffer
  early onset of mortality and rapid growth decline, so they can become sources
  of carbon emissions considerably sooner than stands that are managed at lower
  densities. Additionally, trees grown in less dense conditions generally reach
  a size that is suitable for solid wood products earlier, leading to long-lived
  wood products sooner, adding to the stock of sequestered carbon, and substituting
  for non-wood products that use more fossil fuel in their production. </p>
<p>The accumulation time of aboveground and below-ground biomass ranges from 5
  years (for the shortest rotation times in tropical plantations) to 150 years
  or more on low-potential sites in boreal forests. The tree biomass carbon accumulation
  process is not difficult to quantify and predict where well-developed forest
  growth and yield models are available. Conversion factors have been published
  to convert merchantable stemwood estimates into total tree biomass, including
  roots (Marklund, 1988; Birdsey, 1996). Soil carbon accumulation processes under
  forest management are less well researched in many forest regions. </p>
<p>Only a few studies exist on the relationship between forest regeneration and
  carbon sequestration (e.g., Lunnan <i>et al.</i>, 1991; Hoen and Solberg, 1994;
  Xu, 1995; Row, 1996; Nabuurs <i>et al.</i>, 1999; Ravindranath <i>et al.</i>,
  1999). </p>
