<h4>2.5.2.5. Consistency with International and National Environmental Impacts
  Standards and Guidelines</h4>
<p>For site-specific climate mitigation projects, including those in the LULUCF
  sector, one means of assessing and strengthening their contributions to sustainable
  development is through the application of environmental impact assessments (EIAs)
  prior to project approval. An EIA is a broad process that informs decisionmakers
  about a project's potential environmental and societal risks and impacts, as
  well as examining alternatives and identifying mitigative measures (Krawetz,
  1991; Glasson <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Munn, 1994). Running in parallel with the
  process of identifying, designing, and implementing projects, effective application
  of an EIA to climate mitigation projects might help ensure that potential positive
  and negative environmental and societal impacts (<a href="283.htm">Section 5.5</a>)
  are effectively addressed in all phases of project development. </p>
<p>Currently, more than 100 countries have a national EIA system (Canter, 1996).
  One factor that affects their applicability to LULUCF climate mitigation projects
  is that EIA guidelines and their degree of rigor in application vary widely.
  For projects between countries, this factor could create an incentive for project
  investors to support carbon-offset projects in areas with the least rigorous
  standards. </p>
<p>One option for the Parties to address this concern would be to adopt internationally
  recognized EIA standards and guidelines for carbon-offset projects. For example,
  the World Bank has published its three volume <i>Environmental Assessment Sourcebook</i>
  (World Bank, 1991). The <i>Sourcebook</i> contains sectoral guidelines for natural
  forest, livestock, rangeland, and agricultural production management; plantation
  development/reforestation; and watershed development. For each of these sectors,
  the <i>Sourcebook</i> identifies several potential environmental and social
  impacts, as well as mitigating measures for negative impacts. Potential social
  impacts identified in the <i>Sourcebook</i> include impacts on the labor market
  and labor availability; a shift to more cash-based economy; alteration of daily
  living patterns and the political power structure; changes in access to resources,
  perhaps through changes in land tenure; changes in infrastructure and social
  services; and changes in population demography, such as increases in internal
  migration as a result of project activities. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
  has a similar manual titled <i>Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural
  and Natural Resources Development Projects</i> (ADB, 1990). </p>
<p>For projects between countries, this concern also could be addressed by ensuring
  that the national environmental standards and guidelines of donor and host countries
  be satisfied. The effectiveness of EIAs can be further strengthened by ensuring
  that they are carried out by independent, third-party experts; that they clearly
  integrate socioeconomic and environmental aspects of project assessment; and
  that recommendations be demonstrably incorporated into project activities. </p>
<p>A decision by the Parties to adopt requirements that climate mitigation projects
  undergo EIAs prior to project approval may affect project costs and the rate
  of project implementation. This Special Report does not analyze the potential
  cost and time implications of adopting national and/or international EIA standards
  and guidelines for LULUCF projects. </p>
