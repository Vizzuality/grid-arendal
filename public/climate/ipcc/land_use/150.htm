<h3>3.5.4. Global Assessment </h3>
<p>Policymakers require information on potential global carbon amounts that may
  result from implementation of Article 3.3. Scientific data to estimate the potential
  amount of carbon involved in ARD activities on a global scale since 1990 are
  unsatisfactorily sparse. At best, with the few available estimates, one can
  put coarse bounds on those amounts and refine the bounds with results from isolated
  regional studies and with mathematical models. </p>
<h4><a name="s3-5-4-1"></a>3.5.4.1. How Much Carbon is Global Deforestation Likely
  to Release and How is It Distributed Spatially? </h4>
<p>The effects of deforestation will depend in large part on the amount of land
  deforested and the amount of carbon in forests at the time of deforestation.
  Published averages are about 400 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> above and below ground in boreal forests,
  150 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> in temperate forests, and 250 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> in tropical forests (Dixon
  <i>et al.</i>, 1994). There is considerable variability to these values. Olson
  <i>et al.</i> (1983) estimate that aboveground biomass of all forest and woodland
  varies between 40 and 250 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>, with boreal forest and woodland ranging
  from 20 to 80 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> in the north and 60 to 140 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> in the south. These
  values for boreal forest do not include the large quantities of soil organic
  carbon reported from Russian forests (Dixon <i>et al.</i>, 1994). Temperate
  forests also vary widely: from 60 to 140 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> for closed forest. Tropical
  regions may contain as little as 20-50 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> in savannas and dry forests
  but up to 250 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> in wet tropical forests (Olson <i>et al.</i>, 1983).
  The global area of forests is about 4.2 billion ha, including 1.4 billion ha
  in the boreal zone, 1.0 billion ha in temperate forests, and 1.8 billion ha
  in tropical forests (Dixon <i>et al.</i>, 1994). The estimate of global forest
  area is much more sensitive than that of biomass to minimum tree cover on which
  the forest definition is based. </p>
<p>The partitioning of organic carbon into living biomass and dead organic matter
  pools differs greatly between ecological zones (Olson <i>et al.</i>, 1983).
  The proportion of total ecosystem carbon in below-ground biomass and soil organic
  matter is greatest in boreal forests (84 percent) and smallest in the tropics
  (50 percent), with temperate forest values falling between those two (63 percent).
  Therefore, the inclusion of soil carbon into the definition of forest carbon
  will produce considerable liability for highest-latitude countries when deforestation
  emissions are considered, with increasingly less liability nearer the equator.
  Moreover, the decision about which carbon pools to include under the Kyoto Protocol
  will have differential effects on the timing of the carbon release in all three
  regions. On average, deforestation activities are likely to release less carbon
  than the true carbon stock values because not all carbon will be oxidized or
  exported as wood products. In addition, oxidation of organic residues resulting
  from deforestation declines as a negative exponential process requiring many
  years (Harmon <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Micales and Skog, 1997). Thus, the emission
  of carbon from soils in the first decade or so following deforestation will
  be much more rapid than carbon sequestration during the first decade or so following
  afforestation and reforestation (Harmon <i>et al.</i>, 1986; Kirilenko and Solomon,
  1998). </p>
<p>The total amount of carbon that may be released annually to the atmosphere
  by global deforestation because of agriculture and fuel wood extraction was
  projected with a spatially explicit model (IMAGE 2.1) by Alcamo <i>et al.</i>
  (1996). Their projections at 5-year intervals (<a href="#table3-16">Table 3-16</a>)
  include carbon releases of 0.94 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> in 1990. Linear interpolation of their
  5-year interval data produces values of 1.85 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> in 2008 and 2.09 Gt C
  yr<sup>-1</sup> in 2012. More recent simulations with a more detailed version of the model
  (Leemans <i>et al.</i>, 1998) are lower overall, with estimated carbon releases
  of 1.02 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> in 1990, 1.31 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> in 2008, and 1.31 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> in 2012.
  Yamagata and Alexandrov (1999) obtained a value of 1.0 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> for 2005-2010.
  These latter values are considerably lower than the most recent estimates of
  carbon emissions from deforestation during 1980-1989: 1.7 ï¿½ 0.8 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> (Houghton,
  1999; see <a href="019.htm">Section 1.2.1.2</a>). </p>

<p>These estimates are sensitive to the forest definitions used, however. For
  example, if savannas are considered to be forests (normally they are not)-and
  conversion of savannas is considered as deforestation-the estimate of Yamagata
  and Alexandrov rises to 1.8 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>. In contrast, inclusion of a 40 percent
  tree cover threshold (excluding both savanna and some open woodland) reduces
  the estimate from 1.8 to 0.9 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup>. </p>
