<h4>2.3.6.2. Duration of Sequestration </h4>
<p>Carbon sequestration in forest and other types of land cover is potentially
  reversible because carbon contained in terrestrial ecosystems is vulnerable
  to disturbances such as wildfires or pest outbreaks, as well as subsequent changes
  in management that would return some or all of the sequestered carbon to the
  atmosphere in addition to what would have been released if the sequestration
  activity had never taken place.<a href="fn3.htm#3" onClick="showFootnote(3,3); return false;"><sup>3</sup></a> This situation
  contrasts with the case of avoided fossil fuel emissions because fossil fuels
  left in the ground in a given year will not be accidentally released in a subsequent
  year, even if the emission reduction activity itself is of a limited duration.
  For example, suppose that a homeowner replaces an incandescent bulb with a compact
  fluorescent bulb, avoiding one ton of emissions over the life of the compact
  fluorescent. This benefit is not reversed even if an incandescent bulb is installed
  at the end of the fluorescent's useful life. </p>
<p>It is important to understand that the logic behind considering either fossil
  fuel or forest as "permanent" is not based on the assumption that specific atoms
  of carbon will remain in the ground or in the forest forever. Instead, the effect
  of delaying for 1 year a given amount of fossil fuel burning or a given amount
  of deforestation will be to delay the release of carbon from the barrels of
  oil that would be burned or hectares of forest that would be deforested in subsequent
  years. To the extent that the emission displacement propagates forward until
  the end of the time horizon, the result is a "permanent" saving. Suppose that
  each ton of carbon is labeled ton<span class="subscript">1</span> through ton<span class="subscript">n</span>,
  and a mitigation project avoids 1 t of emissions in year 1. As <a href="#table2-4">Table
  2-4</a> illustrates, ton<span class="subscript">1</span> is emitted in year 1 in the baseline scenario
  but is emitted in year 2 in the mitigation scenario. By the end of the time
  horizon (year n), n tons have been burned in the baseline scenario, but only
  n-1 tons have been burned in the mitigation scenario. The savings would not
  be permanent, on the other hand, if avoiding 1 t of emissions in year 1 results
  in additional emissions in any subsequent year before the end of the time horizon
  because of resource exhaustion or price feedbacks. </p>

<p>The potential reversibility of biotic carbon sequestration implies that substituting
  credit for LULUCF activities for reductions in fossil fuel emissions carries
  a risk of increasing long-term atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentrations (Lashof and Hare,
  1999). Fearnside (1999b) has argued, however, that this reasoning applies only
  to silvicultural plantations, and within the category of plantations it applies
  only to their role in carbon sequestration (as distinct from fossil fuel substitution).
  Lashof and Hare's argument is that, by allowing countries to emit more carbon
  from fossil stocks into the active carbon pool (biosphere + atmosphere), the
  increases in biotic carbon stocks that have been encouraged under the Kyoto
  Protocol as carbon offsets have a risk of subsequent release into the atmosphere
  through natural changes (which fossil carbon stocks do not have), and reduce
  the options available for future responses in the forest sector because the
  capacity of these options to absorb carbon will have been saturated. </p>
<p>Fearnside (1999b) has argued that, in the case of avoiding tropical deforestation,
  the result is more like reducing fossil fuel carbon emissions than it is like
  carbon sequestration in plantations. Carbon stocks in areas of high-biomass
  old-growth forest, such as those in the moist tropics, are very unlikely to
  be allowed to regenerate to their present levels if these forests are cut down.
  Therefore, some of the carbon released by deforesting these areas is just as
  permanent an addition to what might be called the "most active carbon pool"
  (i.e., atmospheric carbon plus carbon in rapidly cycling stocks such as plantation
  biomass) as is release of fossil carbon. Activities by Annex I countries under
  the Kyoto Protocol to offset fossil fuel carbon emissions by helping tropical
  forest countries avoid deforestation keeps carbon out of this "most active pool"
  in the same way that avoiding fossil carbon emissions would and thus avoids
  carbon releases that would be just as irreversible as fossil fuel combustion
  (Fearnside, 1999b). These assumptions can break down if the area of remaining
  forest is small enough that it could be exhausted within the time horizon under
  consideration. If a country runs out of forest (or accessible or unprotected
  forest) within the time horizon, no net reduction in the atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span> concentration
  would accrue, although there may still be a benefit from the delayed emissions
  (see <a href="074.htm">Section 2.3.6.3</a>). </p>
<p>Concern regarding the duration of sequestration arises from the fact that forests
  are subject to degradation or destruction by forces such as climate change,
  extreme weather events under current climate regimes, insect outbreaks, diseases,
  and the entry of loggers or deforesters. These events can release all or part
  of the carbon contained in the affected forests. <a href="#table2-5">Table 2-5</a>
  shows the effect on carbon benefits in a hypothetical deforestation avoidance
  case. Here the hectares of forest cleared each year lose biomass from generalized
  degradation of the forest. Although a full hectare is gained by the cascading
  effect (as in the fossil fuel case in <a href="#table2-4">Table 2-4</a>), the
  displaced hectare also degrades, proportionally reducing the benefit. In the
  example in <a href="#table2-5">Table 2-5</a>, the total emission in the baseline
  scenario is 2.8 t C; in the mitigation scenario the total emission is 2.4 t
  C. If no degradation had taken place, the totals would have been 4 and 3 t C,
  respectively. </p>

<p>One approach to accounting for net impacts on the atmosphere is to treat removals
  and emissions as separate events. In this case, a full 1 t of credit would be
  awarded for each ton of carbon emissions avoided or removed in the year that
  it occurs; there would be an ongoing liability to account for any subsequent
  release of that carbon, however. The separate-events approach would require
  special attention in the context of the Kyoto Protocol: Any credit for carbon
  removed from the atmosphere by, for example, reforestation under Article 3.3
  would have to be balanced by accounting for subsequent emission of that carbon
  regardless of the cause of the emission. In other words, once land enters the
  accounting system, full carbon accounting would have to be applied, even if
  it were to mean accounting for activities (e.g., forest degradation) that might
  not otherwise be included in the accounting system. A similar continuing liability
  would be required for project-based activities if unaccounted releases to the
  atmosphere are to be avoided. If full credit is awarded when removals occur,
  credits would have to be retired for any subsequent release of this carbon,
  even if it occurs after the end of the formal project period in a country that
  does not otherwise have quantified emission limits. </p>
