<h3>5.5.2. Associated Impacts of Projects that Sequester Carbon</h3>
<p>Under a carbon market, projects that promote afforestation through plantation
  forestry may be attractive to many prospective investors, given their potential
  to generate profitable financial returns in addition to carbon credits (Frumhoff
  <i>et al.</i>, 1998). The potential impacts of projects that are designed to
  promote afforestation through plantation forestry will vary significantly with
  location, scale, use of native versus exotic tree species, and intensity of
  management. Intensively managed plantations, for example, can help maintain
  and improve soil properties, particularly if understory vegetation and leaf
  litter is not cleared (Chomitz and Kumari, 1998), as well as providing a source
  for biomass fuels and other wood products. They can have highly variable impacts
  on water resources (<a href="096.htm">Section 2.5.1</a>). Plantations typically
  do not appear to reduce pressure on natural forests in the humid tropics (Kanowski
  <i>et al.</i>, 1992; Johns, 1997) because these forests are not generally cleared
  for the sawn wood, pulpwood, or other products that plantations provide. Kanowski
  <i>et al.</i> (1992) suggest that fuelwood plantations might help reduce pressure
  on natural woodlands in relatively arid regions. Thus, they might help to stem
  desertification in some settings. </p>
<p>Plantation projects would have negative impacts on biodiversity if they replace
  native grassland or woodland habitat or if permanent plantations of exotic species
  were planted in sites where natural or assisted restoration of indigenous forests
  is feasible. Many grassland ecosystems, for example, are rich in endemic species;
  in the Mpumalanga province of South Africa, the expansion of commercial plantations
  (<i>Eucalyptus</i> spp. and <i>Pinus</i> spp.) has led to significant declines
  in several endemic and threatened species of grassland birds (Allan <i>et al.</i>,
  1997). </p>
<p>In contrast, nonpermanent plantations of exotic or native species can be designed
  to enhance biodiversity co-benefits by jump-starting the process of restoring
  natural forests (Keenan <i>et al.</i>, 1997; Lugo, 1997; Parrotta <i>et al.</i>,
  1997a,b). Commercial forestry plantations can also increase biodiversity co-benefits
  by adopting longer rotation times, reducing or eliminating measures to clear
  understory vegetation, using native tree species, and minimizing chemical inputs
  (e.g., Allen <i>et al.</i>, 1995a,b; Da Silva <i>et al.</i>, 1995). </p>
<p>Afforestation or reforestation measures could have positive or negative impacts
  on local communities. Negative impacts can result if projects are implemented
  on land for which communities have alternative priorities, such as agricultural
  production, and if communities are not effectively engaged in all phases of
  project design and implementation (Cullet and Kameri-Mbote, 1998; Section 6.6.3).
  In urban or peri-urban areas, they can also produce significant local socioeconomic
  benefits through improvements in air quality (McPherson, 1994). </p>
<p>Some observers have expressed concern that carbon-offset financing for reforestation
  projects in non-Annex I countries could promote deforestation by financing the
  expansion of plantations that replace natural forests whose associated emissions
  would not be constrained by a national cap (German Advisory Council on Global
  Change, 1998). <a href="106.htm">Section 2.5.2.2</a> discusses possible options,
  should Parties wish to constrain such projects. </p>
<p>Agroforestry activities can sequester carbon and produce a range of environmental
  and socioeconomic benefits. For example, trees in agroforestry farms improve
  soil fertility through control of soil erosion, maintenance of soil organic
  matter and physical properties, increased nutrient inputs through nitrogen fixation
  and uptake from deep soil horizons, and promotion of more closed nutrient cycling
  (Young, 1997). Thus, agroforestry systems that incorporate trees on farms can
  improve and conserve soil properties (Nair, 1989; MacDicken and Vergara, 1990),
  as is the case in the AES Thames Guatemala project (Dixon <i>et al.</i>, 1993).
  Agroforestry projects also may provide local economic benefits, with farmers
  gaining higher income from timber, fruits, medicinals, and extractives than
  they would from alternative agricultural practices (Cooper <i>et al.</i>, 1996).
</p>
<p>Poorly planned and implemented agroforestry projects, however, can fail to
  benefit or have negative impacts on local farmers. For example, the introduction
  of labor-intensive agroforestry technologies can lead to labor competition between
  agroforestry practices and traditional farming (Laquihon, 1989; Repollo and
  Castillo, 1989). Poorly planned projects can also lead to excessive light and
  water competition between crops and trees, as well as reducing the area available
  for food crops. </p>
<p>The associated environmental benefits of project activities that promote assisted
  regeneration of natural forests are similar to those of forest conservation.
  As the forest matures, key benefits may include protection of watersheds, soil
  fertility, and biodiversity. As with forest conservation or plantation forestry,
  assisted forest regeneration could lead to negative social impacts if communities
  are prevented from changing to preferred land uses in the future. This negative
  impact also can be reduced by ensuring that the designation of areas for reforestation
  is consistent with long-term regional land-use plans and that community development
  priorities are effectively incorporated during project development and implementation
  (<a href="286.htm">Section 5.6</a>). </p>
<p>There is very limited experience of LULUCF pilot projects that sequester carbon
  or reduce carbon emissions from agricultural soils. There are vast areas of
  degraded and desertified land in developed and developing countries, however,
  where well-designed projects can add carbon to the soil while increasing agricultural
  productivity and sustainability. </p>
