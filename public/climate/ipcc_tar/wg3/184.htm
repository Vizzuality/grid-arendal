<h2>5.2 Conceptual Framework for Understanding Barriers and Opportunities </h2>
<p>The opportunity to mitigate GHG concentrations by removing or modifying barriers 
  to the spread of technology may be viewed as an association between different 
  types or categories of barriers and different concepts of the potential for 
  GHG mitigation (<a href="180.htm#fig51">Figure 5.1</a>). Each concept of the 
  potential represents a hypothetical projection that might be made today regarding 
  the extent of GHG mitigation over time into the future. The bottom line, labelled 
  &#147;market potential&#148; indicates the amount of GHG mitigation that might 
  be expected to occur under forecast market conditions, with no changes in policy 
  or implementation of measures whose primary purpose is the mitigation of GHGs.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, the &#147;technical potential&#148; describes the maximum 
  amount of GHG mitigation achievable through technology diffusion. This is a 
  hypothetical projection of the extent of GHG mitigation that could be achieved 
  over time if all technically feasible technologies were used in all relevant 
  applications, without regard to their cost or user acceptability.</p>
<p>By definition, it can be said that whatever physical, cultural, institutional, 
  social, or human factors are preventing the progress from the market potential 
  to the technical potential are &#147;barriers&#148; to the mitigation of GHG 
  via technology diffusion. Since, however, the ultimate goal is to understand 
  policy options for mitigation, it is useful to group these barriers in a way 
  that facilitates understanding the kinds of policies that would be necessary 
  to overcome them. As these different categories of barriers are created, there 
  is a corresponding creation of intermediate conceptions of the potential for 
  GHG mitigation. Starting at the bottom, it is possible to imagine addressing 
  barriers (often referred to as &#147;market failures&#148;) that relate to markets, 
  public policies and other institutions that inhibit the diffusion of technologies 
  that are (or are projected to be) cost-effective for users without reference 
  to any GHG benefits they may generate. Amelioration of this class of market 
  and institutional imperfections would increase GHG mitigation towards the level 
  that is labelled as the &#147;economic potential&#148;. The economic potential 
  represents the level of GHG mitigation that could be achieved if all technologies 
  that are cost-effective from consumers&#146; point of view were implemented. 
  Because economic potential is evaluated from the consumer&#146;s point of view, 
  cost-effectiveness would be evaluated using market prices and the private rate 
  of time discounting, and also take into account consumers&#146; preferences 
  regarding the acceptability of the technologies&#146; performance characteristics.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn5.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>3</sup></small></a> 
</p>
<p>Of course, elimination of all of these market and institutional barriers would 
  not produce technology diffusion at the level of the technical potential. The 
  remaining barriers, which define the gap between economic potential and technical 
  potential, are usefully placed in two groups separated by a socioeconomic potential. 
  The first group consists of barriers derived from people&#146;s preferences 
  and other social and cultural barriers to the diffusion of new technology. That 
  is, even if market and institutional barriers are removed, some GHG-mitigating 
  technologies may not be widely used simply because people do not like them, 
  are too poor to afford them, or because existing social and cultural forces 
  operate against their acceptance. If, in addition to overcoming market and institutional 
  barriers, this second group of barriers could be overcome, the &#147;socioeconomic 
  potential&#148; would be achieved. Thus, the socioeconomic potential represents 
  the level of GHG mitigation that would be achieved if all technologies that 
  are cost effective (on the basis of a social rather than a private rate of discount) 
  are implemented, without regard to existing concerns about their performance 
  characteristics, and without regard to social and cultural obstacles to their 
  use.</p>
<p>Finally, even if all market, institutional, social, and cultural barriers were 
  removed, some technologies might not be widely used simply because they are 
  too expensive. That is, the definition of socioeconomic potential includes the 
  requirement that technologies be cost-effective. Elimination of this requirement 
  would therefore allow a progression to the level of &#147;technical potential&#148;, 
  the maximum technologically feasible extent of GHG mitigation through technology 
  diffusion.</p>
<p>An issue arises as to how to treat the relative environmental costs of different 
  technologies within this framework. Because the purpose of the exercise is ultimately 
  to identify opportunities for global climate change policies, the technology 
  potentials are defined without regard to GHG impacts. Costs and benefits associated 
  with other environmental impacts would be part of the cost-effectiveness calculation 
  underlying economic potential only insofar as existing environmental regulations 
  or policies internalize these effects and thereby impose them on consumers. 
  Broader impacts might be ignored by consumers, and hence not enter into the 
  determination of economic potential, but they would be incorporated into a social 
  cost-effectiveness calculation. Thus, to the extent that other environmental 
  benefits make certain technologies socially cost-effective, even if they are 
  not cost-effective from a consumer&#146;s point of view, the GHG benefits of 
  diffusion of such technologies would be incorporated in the socioeconomic potential.</p>
<p>The technical potential can be illustrated with reference to the fuel cell 
  as a power source for private vehicles. Current fuel cell technology, making 
  use of hydrogen manufactured from natural gas, can offer GHG emission reductions 
  of around 50%-60% relative to conventional vehicles. This gives some indication 
  of the current technical potential for mitigation. It is imaginable that in 
  the future, fuel cell vehicles using hydrogen or other fuels from non-fossil 
  sources would have even lower GHG emissions, on a full fuel cycle basis (Michaelis, 
  1997c). Thus, the technical potential of fuel cells for GHG mitigation is significant, 
  and is expected to improve over time, as shown in <a href="180.htm#fig51">Figure 
  5.1</a>, through scientific discovery and technological development. However, 
  the Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU, 1994) notes numerous challenges that 
  would have to be overcome before such vehicles could enter widespread use and 
  offer more substantial emission reductions. In other words, the current market 
  potential is very small at best. The large gap between the market and technical 
  potentials (at the present time) can be understood in terms of specific barriers. 
  Some of these relate to technology performance and cost, while others have to 
  do with fitting non-fossil fuels into the existing infrastructure. The need 
  to improve the cost and performance of the technology would represent barriers 
  separating the technical and socioeconomic potentials. To the extent that the 
  diffusion of cost-effective fuel cells is or will be limited by rigidities in 
  the existing infrastructure, these could be considered barriers separating the 
  economic and socioeconomic potentials for this technology. </p>
<p>The economic potential can be similarly illustrated, for example, with reference 
  to energy conservation opportunities in buildings. Engineering-based analysis 
  in the United States and other countries indicates that measures such as replacing 
  tungsten filament bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), insulating hot 
  water tanks, and introducing more energy-efficient refrigerators, could reduce 
  residential electricity by about 40% and deliver a net saving to consumers (IPCC, 
  1996). To the extent that achievement of these savings is limited by market 
  and institutional imperfections (such as imperfect information or misplaced 
  incentives), the savings they offer represent the economic potential of these 
  technologies. But even if all of these imperfections were corrected, these technologies 
  would not be used in all possible applications. Some people will not use them 
  because they find them inferior on aesthetic or performance grounds. Other potential 
  users will judge that the high private discount rates they believe are appropriate 
  to this kind of investment render the savings too small to justify the high 
  up-front cost. If, in addition to overcoming market and institutional imperfections, 
  these aspects of consumer preferences were ignored, the socioeconomic potential 
  could then be identified. Finally, even this level of GHG mitigation is smaller 
  than the technical potential, as illustrated in <a href="180.htm#fig51">Figure 
  5.1</a>, because many technologies that are available, such as rooftop solar 
  photovoltaic electricity supplies, would not pay for themselves in energy savings 
  even at the social discount rate.</p>
<p><a href="#tab51">Table 5.1</a> begins with the baseline level of GHG mitigation 
  that could be achieved without policy intervention (market potential), and then 
  examines in more detail the nature of the barriers and opportunities that are 
  encountered as greater mitigation is pursued, i.e., move towards the technical 
  potential in <a href="180.htm#fig51">Figure 5.1</a>. Identification of the nature 
  of the barriers and opportunities that separate each of the levels is necessary 
  in order to formulate policy responses to overcome the barriers. The barriers 
  to the achievement of economic potential are market and other institutional 
  failures in the markets for technology, and government policies that distort 
  these markets. These include market failures related to information and capital 
  markets, subsidies for energy use. and trade barriers that inhibit the import 
  of energy-efficient technologies. In principle, policies can be designed to 
  address each of these market or government failures.</p>

<p>Identification of the opportunities to achieve economic potential is important, 
  because removal of these barriers in a cost-effective way would be desirable 
  even if global climate change (GCC) were not a policy concern. That is, if policies 
  can be devised to overcome market and institutional barriers to the use of cost-effective 
  technologies with desirable performance characteristics, consumers would be 
  better off even before any consideration of GCC benefits. The barriers to the 
  achievement of socioeconomic potential include social and cultural constraints, 
  as well as economic forces that cannot be characterized as imperfections of 
  markets or of other institutions. Policies to mitigate the market and institutional 
  imperfections separating market and economic potential constitute &#147;no regrets&#148; 
  policies, i.e., policies that societies would not regret implementing no matter 
  what is learned later about the severity of the GCC problem.</p>
<p>The barriers to the achievement of socioeconomic potential include social and 
  cultural constraints, as well as economic forces that cannot be characterized 
  as imperfections of markets or of other institutions. Other barriers to socioeconomic 
  potential relate to consumer preferences, including attitudes towards uncertainty. 
  Uncertainty about whether estimates of new technologies and cost savings will 
  actually come to pass limits the adoption of new technologies; such hesitation 
  in the face of uncertainty is completely rational given the irreversible nature 
  of many energy-conservation investments (Hassett and Metcalf, 1993, 1994). Even 
  putting aside the effects of uncertainty, private decision makers may utilize 
  discount rates to assess the value of future energy savings that are significantly 
  higher than the discount rates applied in the engineering-economic calculations 
  to indicate that particular technologies are cost-effective. Such higher discount 
  rates make the energy savings less valuable and, hence, may lead to a conclusion 
  that the technologies are not cost-effective for a particular user.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic potential also recognizes that the economic feasibility of particular 
  technologies is constrained by social structures and cultural forces; it is 
  possible to consider changing those structures because of GCC objectives. For 
  example, if the land-use and transportation systems of the USA could be radically 
  transformed, the potential for improvement of energy efficiency in the transportation 
  sector would be much greater than anything that could be achieved taking those 
  structures as given (see <a href="205.htm">Section 5.4</a> below). Hence, part 
  of the gap between the economic and socioeconomic potential represents the savings 
  that could result from changes in the structure of such systems.</p>
<p>The last set of barriers to achieving technical potential relate to the cost 
  and performance of the technologies. These can be improved upon by solving scientific 
  and technological problems, so policies to overcome this category of barriers 
  could be aimed at fostering the research and development (R&amp;D) process, 
  either in the public or private sectors. In addition, because production costs 
  typically fall as experience with a particular technology accumulates, policies 
  that foster adoption of new technologies can, over time, produce cost reductions 
  and performance improvements. The effect of such improvements would be to make 
  the technologies more cost-effective and consumer-favoured, thus moving both 
  the economic and socioeconomic potentials towards the level of the technical 
  potential.</p>
<p><a href="180.htm#fig51">Figure 5.1</a> provides illustrative examples of the 
  barriers that separate one potential from another. Actions to overcome these 
  barriers need not necessarily take place in the order of the potentials. R&amp;D 
  could take place to approach the technical potential at the same time that institutional 
  and subsidy reforms are being carried out to approach the socioeconomic and 
  economic potentials respectively. While the figure denotes a hierarchy in terms 
  of the potentials, there is no hierarchy in the interventions that might be 
  pursued to overcome the barriers. Furthermore, an intervention may overcome 
  more than one barrier that need not be in a hierarchical order either, e.g., 
  the provision of information could address all categories of barriers. </p>
<p>Because some interventions may be more effective than others, the gaps between 
  the various potentials are likely to be reduced to varying degrees as well. 
  Thus, the gap between the socioeconomic and economic potential may completely 
  disappear, and yet that between the economic and market potential may remain 
  in place. This indicates that while the market potential has moved up, it still 
  could be improved by removing what economists refer to as market failures.</p>
