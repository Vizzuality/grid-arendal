<h3><a name="123"></a> 1.2.3 The Role of Technology </h3>
<p>The time horizon for climate change is long. The climate impacts of decisions 
  made in the next decade or two will be felt over the next century and beyond. 
  As a result, technology and, more specifically, improvements in the rate and 
  direction of technological change, will play a very important role. As discussed 
  in <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a>, the development and diffusion of new technologies 
  is perhaps the most robust and effective way to reduce GHG emissions. Three 
  aspects of technology can be distinguished: invention (the development, perhaps 
  in a laboratory, of a new production method, product, or service), innovation 
  (the bringing of new inventions to the market), and diffusion (the gradual adoption 
  of new processes or products by firms and individuals). <a href="089.htm">Chapter 
  3</a> indicates that hundreds of recently invented technologies can improve 
  energy efficiency and thus reduce energy and associated GHG emissions. These 
  technologies can yield more energy-efficient buildings and appliances and equipment 
  used in them. There are, however, significant barriers to their innovation and 
  diffusion. <a href="179.htm">Chapter 5</a> (see also IPCC, 2000a) classifies 
  these barriers and provides a framework for understanding their connections 
  with one another. Some new low-carbon emission technologies are not adopted 
  because their cost and performance characteristics make them unattractive relative 
  to existing technologies. To be adopted, these technologies require tax advantages, 
  cost subsidies, or additional cost-reducing or performance-enhancing research 
  and development (R&amp;D; see <a href="224.htm">Chapter 6</a> for a discussion 
  of the possible efficacy of such policies). Other technologies could be adopted 
  more rapidly if market failures and other socioeconomic constraints are reduced. 
  Market failures refers to situations in which the price system does not allocate 
  resources efficiently (see, e.g., Opschoor, 1997). They can emerge when information 
  is not fully disseminated or when market prices do not reflect the full social 
  cost. So, a new technology may not be employed if potential purchasers lack 
  information about it or if its price lies between its private value and its, 
  potentially higher, social value.</p>
<p>While <a href="089.htm">Chapter 3</a> summarizes advances in our understanding 
  of technological options to limit or reduce GHG emissions, <a href="155.htm">Chapter 
  4</a> indicates that terrestrial systems offer significant potential to capture 
  and hold substantially increased volumes of carbon within organic material. 
  However, the challenges associated with defining and measuring contributions 
  to sequestration and with monitoring the performance of individual sink projects 
  are significant. The nature of sequestration opportunities differs by region. 
  In some regions, the least-cost method of accomplishing sequestration is to 
  slow or halt deforestation. In others, afforestation and reforestation of abandoned 
  agricultural lands, degraded forests, and wastelands offer the lowest-cost opportunities. 
  The results of the IPCC (2000c) Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change 
  and Forestry may shed light on some of these controversies. In all cases, though, 
  the opportunity costs associated with using terrestrial systems involve welfare 
  implications on multiple scales. <br>
