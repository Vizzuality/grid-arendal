<h2>3.3 Buildings</h2>
<a name="331"></a> 
<h3>3.3.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>This section addresses greenhouse gas emissions and emissions reduction opportunities 
  for residential and commercial (including institutional) buildings, often called 
  the residential and service sectors. Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel 
  energy used directly or as electricity to power equipment and condition the 
  air (including both heating and cooling) within these buildings is by far the 
  largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in this sector. Other sources include 
  HFCs from the production of foam insulation and for use in residential and commercial 
  refrigeration and air conditioning, and a variety of greenhouse gases produced 
  through combustion of biomass in cookstoves.</p>
<a name="332"></a> 
<h3>3.3.2 Summary of the Second Assessment Report</h3>
<p>The Second Assessment Report (SAR) reviewed historical energy use and greenhouse 
  gas emissions trends as well as mitigation options in the buildings sector in 
  Chapter 22, Mitigation Options for Human Settlements (Levine <i>et al</i>., 1996a). 
  This chapter showed that residential and commercial buildings accounted for 
  19% and 10%, respectively, of global carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions 
  from the use of fossil fuels in 1990. More recent estimates increase this percentage 
  to 21% for residential buildings and 10.5% for commercial buildings, both for 
  1990 and 1995, as shown in <a href="091.htm#tab31">Table 3.1</a>. Globally, 
  space heating is the dominant energy end-use in both residential and commercial 
  buildings. Developed countries account for the vast majority of buildings-related 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but the bulk of growth in these emissions over the 
  past two decades was seen in developing countries. The SAR found that many cost-effective 
  technologies are available to reduce energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, 
  but that consumers and decision-makers often do not invest in energy efficiency 
  for a variety of reasons, including existing economic incentives, levels of 
  information, and conditions in the market. The SAR concluded that under a scenario 
  with aggressive adoption of energy-efficiency measures, cost-effective energy 
  efficiency could likely cut projected baseline growth in carbon emissions from 
  energy use in buildings by half over the next two decades.</p>
<a name="333"></a> 
<h3>3.3.3 Historic and Future Trends</h3>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> from energy use is the dominant greenhouse gas emitted in the 
  buildings sector, followed by HFCs used in refrigeration, air conditioning, 
  and foam insulation, and cookstove emissions of methane and nitrous oxide (see 
  <a href="#tab32">Table 3.2</a>). Developed countries have the largest emissions 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> and HFCs, while developing countries have the largest emissions 
  of greenhouse gases from non-renewable biomass combustion in cookstoves (Smith 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000). It is noted, however, that the biomass energy source is being 
  replaced with non-renewable carbon-based fuels (Price <i>et al</i>., 1998). This trend 
  is expected to continue.</p>

</table>
<p>Energy use in buildings exhibited a steady growth from 1971 through 1990 in 
  all regions of the world, averaging almost 3% per year. Because of the decline 
  in energy use in buildings in the former Soviet Union after 1989, global energy 
  use in buildings has grown slower than for other sectors in recent years. Growth 
  in commercial buildings was higher than growth in residential buildings in all 
  regions of the world, averaging 3.5% per year globally between 1971 and 1990. 
  Energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions also grew during this period. By 1995, 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuels and electricity used in buildings reached 
  874MtC and 858MtC, respectively, for a total of 1732MtC, or 98% of all buildings-related 
  GHG emissions. Growth in these CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was slower than the 
  growth in primary energy in both the developed countries and the rest-of-world 
  region, most likely the result of fuel switching to lower carbon fuels in these 
  regions. In contrast, growth in energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the 
  developing countries &#151; Asia Pacific region &#151; was 6.3% per year between 
  1971 and 1995, greater than the 5.5% per year growth in primary energy use, 
  reflecting a growing reliance on more carbon-intensive fuels in this region.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>6</sup></small></a></p>
<p>Non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gas emissions from the buildings sector are hydrofluorocarbons 
  (HFCs)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
  used or projected to be used in residential and commercial refrigerators, air 
  conditioning systems, and in open and closed cell foam for insulation. HFCs 
  in the building sector were essentially zero in 1995, but are projected to grow 
  as they replace ozone-depleting substances (see <a href="142.htm">Appendix</a> 
  to this chapter). In addition, methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), 
  carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) (along with CO<sub>2</sub>) 
  are produced through combustion of biomass in cookstoves (Levine <i>et al</i>., 1996b; 
  Smith <i>et al</i>., 2000). It is estimated the biomass cookstoves emit about 40MtCeq, 
  2% of total buildings-related GHG emissions (Smith <i>et al</i>., 2000). These emissions 
  are concentrated in developing countries, where biomass fuels can account for 
  more than 40% of the total energy used in residences (UNDP, 1999).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#8","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>8</sup></small></a></p>
<p>Key drivers of energy use and related GHG emissions in buildings include activity 
  (population growth, size of labour force, urbanization, number of households, 
  per capita living area, and persons per residence), economic variables (change 
  in GDP and personal income), energy efficiency trends, and carbon intensity 
  trends. These factors are in turn driven by changes in consumer preferences, 
  energy and technology costs, settlement patterns, technical change, and overall 
  economic conditions. </p>
<p>Urbanization, especially in developing countries, is clearly associated with 
  increased energy use. As populations become more urbanized and commercial fuels, 
  especially electricity, become easier to obtain, the demand for energy services 
  such as refrigeration, lighting, heating, and cooling increases. The number 
  of people living in urban areas almost doubled between 1970 and 1995, growing 
  from 1.36 billion, or 37% of the total, in 1970 to 2.57 billion, or 45% of the 
  total, in 1995 (UN, 1996). </p>
<p>Driving forces influencing the use of HFCs include both its suitability as 
  a replacement for CFCs and HCFCs, as well as an awareness of the contribution 
  of HFCs to global climate change. It is expected that this awareness will continue 
  to drive decisions to use HFCs only in highest value applications. Some countries 
  have enacted regulations limiting emissions of HFCs while others have established 
  voluntary agreements with industry to reduce HFC use (see <a href="142.htm">Appendix</a> 
  to this chapter).</p>
<p>Global projections of primary energy use for the buildings sector show a doubling, 
  from 103EJ to 208EJ, between 1990 and 2020 in a baseline scenario (WEC, 1995a). 
  The most rapid growth is seen in the commercial buildings sector, which is projected 
  to grow at an average rate of 2.6% per year. Increases in energy use in the 
  EITs are projected to be as great as those in the developing countries, as these 
  countries recover from the economic crises and as the growth in developing countries 
  begins to slow. Under a scenario where state-of-the-art technology is adopted, 
  global primary energy consumption in the buildings sector will only grow to 
  about 170EJ in 2020. A more aggressive &#147;ecologically driven/advanced technology&#148; 
  scenario, which assumes an international commitment to energy efficiency as 
  well as rapid technological progress and widespread application of policies 
  and programmes to speed the adoption of energy-efficient technologies in all 
  major regions of the world, results in primary energy use of 140EJ in 2020 (WEC, 
  1995a).</p>
<p>The IPCC&#146;s IS92a scenario projected baseline global carbon dioxide emissions 
  from the buildings sector to grow from 1900 MtC to 2700MtC between 1990 and 
  2020. An analysis of the potential reductions from implementation of energy-efficient 
  technologies found that annual global carbon dioxide emissions from the buildings 
  sector could be reduced by an estimated 950MtC in 2020 compared to the IS92a 
  baseline scenario (Acosta Moreno <i>et al</i>., 1996). Over 60% of these projected 
  savings are realized through improvements in residential equipment and the thermal 
  integrity of buildings globally. Carbon dioxide emissions from commercial buildings 
  grow from 37% to 41% of total buildings emissions between 1990 and 2020 as a 
  result of expected increases in commercial floor space (which implies increases 
  in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVAC)) as well as increased 
  use of office and other commercial sector equipment (Acosta Moreno <i>et al</i>., 1996; 
  WEC, 1995a).</p>
<p>The B2 scenario from the IPCC&#146;s Special Report on Emissions Scenario projects 
  buildings sector carbon dioxide emissions to grow from 1,790MtC in 1990 to 3,090MtC 
  in 2020. The most rapid growth is seen in the developing countries, which show 
  an average growth in buildings-related carbon dioxide emissions of over 3% per 
  year. In contrast, this scenario envisions that the emissions from buildings 
  in the EIT region continue to decline, at an average annual rate of &#150;1.3% 
  (Nakicenovic <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
