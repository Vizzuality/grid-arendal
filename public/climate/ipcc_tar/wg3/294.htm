<h3>7.3.6 Uncertainty<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#12","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>12</sup></small></a></h3>
<p>A thread that runs through much of the discussion of costs is that of uncertainty. 
  The whole exercise of estimating mitigation costs is confounded by imprecise 
  information about baselines, and the costs of mitigation and adaptation measures 
  (especially future costs). It is critical that such uncertainties be recognized 
  and conveyed to the policymakers in the most effective manner possible. </p>
<p>As discussed above, uncertainty about baselines is best dealt with by taking 
  more than one baseline and reporting cost estimates for multiple baselines. 
  Hence costs should not be given as single values, but as ranges based on the 
  full set of plausible baselines. </p>
<p>Technological uncertainty is another key area. As noted in <a href="291.htm#7341">Section 
  7.3.4.1</a>, the autonomous rate of improvement in the energy-to-GDP ratio that 
  underlies almost all models of climate economics is a clear example of an exogenous 
  parameter currently subject to uncertainty. This is not easy to overcome by 
  endogenizing technical change, as practical models currently available have 
  difficulties in dealing with endogenous technical change. Thus, the way firms 
  develop new technologies is probably an issue surrounded by a greater uncertainty 
  than uncertainty on the consumer side. There is a moderate degree of consensus 
  in the literature on these issues. As with baselines, a scenario approach is 
  essential and results have to be reported for both &#147;optimistic&#148; and 
  &#147;pessimistic&#148; development paths.</p>
<p>Taking a different approach, the way consumers adopt existing lower carbon 
  technologies and firms develop new ones can be viewed as key sources of uncertainty 
  in costing methodologies. These assumptions are crucial, as different valuations 
  are likely to affect the conclusions. However, the ways in which guidance and 
  information about these two crucial issues are provided are radically different. 
  Two different options are available from the consumer side. First, energy oriented 
  macroeconometric models can provide a price elasticity to show how changes in 
  the fuel mix are driven by relative prices. No specific direction of technological 
  change can be derived from this class of model. However, differences in the 
  results in terms of different energy structures (and different carbon impacts) 
  could easily emerge. Second, engineering studies can provide some indications 
  about available lower energy technologies to show the impact on energy demand 
  and carbon emissions. Hence, from the point of view of uncertainty there is 
  no <i>a priori</i> reason to choose between bottom-up and top-down models.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally there are uncertainties in the estimated costs as well as in the estimation 
  of the ancillary benefits and/or co-benefits. As the literature on potential 
  ancillary benefits is continues to develop, current estimates of the net social 
  impacts of various mitigation policies are necessarily incomplete. Private cost 
  figures are generally more certain than the external ones, but some imprecision 
  remains. As with baselines, a scenario approach is recommended, with estimates 
  prepared for a &#147;low value&#148;, a &#147;mid value&#148;, and a &#147;high 
  value&#148;. Uncertainty about the external costs is well recognized. As with 
  the private costs, again a scenario approach that gives a range from low, through 
  mid, to high values is recommended. In both cases the scenario approach provides 
  a sensitivity analysis for the costing exercise. </p>
<p>In the crosscutting paper on uncertainty (Moss and Schneider, 2000), a number 
  of scales are proposed to assess the level of imprecision in the reported impacts, 
  costs, etc. One that has frequently been used for costing exercises is the three-point 
  scale that seeks to evaluate the degree of confidence in a particular result 
  using a scale of: low, medium, and high confidence levels. This has been expanded 
  to a five-point scale, which asks the researcher to select one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#147;very high confidence&#148; (over 95% certain);<br>
  </li>
  <li>&#147;high confidence&#148; (67%&#150;95% certain);<br>
  </li>
  <li>&#147;medium confidence&#148; (33%&#150;67% certain);<br>
  </li>
  <li>&#147;low confidence&#148; (5%&#150;33% certain); and<br>
  </li>
  <li>&#147;very low confidence&#148; (below 5% certain).</li>
</ul>
<p>This has not been applied to cost estimates, but it would useful to establish 
  whether it could be applied and, if so, whether it would provide policymakers 
  with better guidance as to the reliability of the results.</p>
