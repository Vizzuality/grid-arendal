<h3>10.2.6 Global Agreements </h3>
<p>The difficulty of achieving a global agreement on climate change underlined 
  in the previous sections depends on four main factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>The heterogeneity of countries with respect to the causes of climate 
    change, the impacts, and the mitigation and adaptation costs</i>. This factor 
    mainly influences the profitability of the decision to sign a climate agreement. 
    Some countries may lose when signing the agreement, even when environmental 
    benefits are fully accounted for. As shown by Chander and Tulkens (1995, 1997), 
    there always exists a system of economic and technological transfers that 
    may make all countries gain. But this again raises the equity problem and 
    the related burden-sharing issue. Equity may have a large impact on the existence 
    and size of a climate coalition. As previously argued, and as argued by many 
    policymakers and scientists, the way in which the burden of controlling emissions 
    is shared across countries crucially affects a country&#146;s decision to 
    join a coalition. On the one hand, if the burden is not equitably shared, 
    some countries may not find it profitable to sign the agreement. Profitability 
    depends on two main factors: (1) the distribution of costs within the coalition 
    and (2) the size of the coalition. It is possible that there exists a minimum 
    size of the coalition above which it becomes profitable. And these two factors 
    are strictly interdependent. On the other hand, equity also affects free-riding 
    incentives. As in <a href="400.htm">Section 10.2.5</a>, in some cases it may 
    be reasonable for some countries to transfer resources to other countries 
    to induce them to join the coalition on which they would otherwise free-ride. 
    In this case, the final outcome is not equitable&#150;free-riders would gain 
    more than countries in the starting coalition&#150;but it may be environmentally 
    and economically efficient.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>The strong incentives to free-ride on the global agreement and the lack 
    of related sanctions</i>. When all countries agree to control emissions, a 
    defecting country achieves the whole benefit, because its incidence on global 
    emission is marginal (with a few exceptions) and pays no cost. Hence, a defection 
    with respect to a large coalition is the optimal strategy if there are no 
    sanctions. However, credible sanctions are difficult to design (Barrett, 1994). 
    Emissions themselves are hardly a credible sanction, because countries are 
    unlikely to sustain self-damaging policies. Moreover, in this case, asymmetries 
    play a double role: some countries may not gain from signing the environmental 
    agreement, whereas some countries, even when gaining from environmental co-operation, 
    may lose from carrying out the economic sanctions (Barrett, 1997c; Schmidt, 
    1997).<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>The absence of environmental leadership</i>. The process of achieving 
    a global agreement can be a sequential one (Carraro and Siniscalco, 1993), 
    in which case a group of countries take the leadership, start to reduce and/or 
    control emissions and implement strategies such as to induce other countries 
    to follow<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#17","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>17</sup></small></a>. 
    The presence of low-cost climate policies and equitable burden-sharing (Schmidt, 
    1997) are again important elements for the formation of an initial profitable 
    coalition. As said, our definition of profitability accounts for the environmental 
    benefits of emission control. Hence, benefits should be increased by increasing 
    the number of countries that control emissions, but abatement costs should 
    be minimized by exploiting all possible opportunities (including emissions 
    trading). This is a prerequisite to achieving a strong leader coalition that 
    can exert its leadership through the design of better negotiation rules, the 
    implementation of transfer mechanisms, and the credibility of international-issue 
    linkages. A preliminary model of the effects of leadership is given in Jacoby 
    <i>et al</i>. (1998), who show how and when developing countries may join a leader 
    coalition formed by Annex I countries.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>The focus on a single international climate agreement</i>. As explained 
    in <a href="409.htm#1031">Section 10.3.1</a>, if countries may join different 
    coalitions, which means that several agreements can be signed by groups of 
    countries in the same way as countries form trade blocs, then the likelihood 
    that all or almost all countries set emission reduction targets increases 
    (Yi and Shin, 1994; Bloch, 1997; Carraro, 1997, 1998). The outcome of negotiations 
    in which more agreements can be signed is usually a situation with several 
    small environmental blocs (Carraro and Moriconi, 1998), but this can be considered 
    a step in the right direction. If all or almost all countries set emission 
    reduction targets within their own bloc (e.g., regional environmental agreements 
    are signed), then, in a subsequent phase, negotiations among blocs may lead 
    to more ambitious emission reductions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the warning that global agreements may be difficult to reach, many 
  articles analyze the costs of agreements in which all countries participate, 
  in one form or another (see, e.g., Capros, 1998, Ellerman <i>et al</i>., 1998; Manne 
  and Richels, 1998; Shackleton, 1998; Bosello and Roson, 1999; Nordhaus and Boyer, 
  1999). The weakest form, discussed in <a href="399.htm">Section 10.2.4</a>, 
  is that in which a few countries commit to emission reductions, but all accept 
  trade emissions in a single international market. The strongest form is that 
  in which a central planner is assumed to set optimal emissions levels for all 
  world countries. This optimal solution is often proposed as a benchmark for 
  actual negotiations and was often analyzed before Kyoto (see the collection 
  of papers in Carraro (1999d)).</p>
<p>More interesting is the attempt made by Peck and Teisberg (1999) to model the 
  negotiations between developed and developing countries to achieve a global 
  agreement. This paper shows the potential for the achievement of co-operation 
  to be achieved&#150;the Pareto frontier is small, but not empty&#150;but does 
  not analyse the incentives to actually sign the agreement. However, the paper 
  suggests a research direction that at least helps to identify the optimal emission 
  reductions that are profitable for all negotiating countries.</p>
<p>The conclusions that can be derived from this type of empirical analyses are 
  similar to those already mentioned for partial agreements. In the scenario in 
  which baseline emissions are lower, it is easier to achieve a global agreement 
  because lower emissions reductions are necessary (Barrett, 1997b) and consequently 
  abatement costs are lower. Optimal emissions targets are such that they equalize 
  marginal abatement costs. This optimal, cost-minimizing solution can also be 
  achieved through an unconstrained emissions-trading system (Chander <i>et al</i>., 
  1999). Hence, either emissions targets are optimally set, or countries are allowed 
  to trade emissions for any given set of targets through which a global consensus 
  can be achieved. Of course, these two options have different impacts on equity. 
  As shown by Bosello and Roson (1999), starting from the Kyoto targets, international 
  unconstrained emissions trading among all countries achieves optimality, but 
  reduces equity.</p>
