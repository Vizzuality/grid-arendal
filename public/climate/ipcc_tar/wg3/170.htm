<h3><a name="442"></a>4.4.2 Environmental Costs and Ancillary Benefits in Agricultural 
  Lands</h3>
<p>Management strategies that conserve C in agricultural soils may have ancillary 
  benefits quite apart from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> removal. Foremost among 
  these is a favourable effect on soil productivity. Numerous studies have shown 
  a strong link between the organic C content of a soil and its quality for crop 
  production (e.g., Carter <i>et al</i>., 1997; Christensen and Johnston, 1997; Herrick 
  and Wander, 1997). Consequently, a gain in soil C may promote crop yields, and 
  preserve or enhance future soil productivity (Cole <i>et al</i>., 1997; Rosenzweig 
  and Hillel, 2000). For example, application of fertilizers to agro-pastoral 
  systems in parts of South America may not only induce soil C accumulation, but 
  also enhance agricultural productivity (Fisher <i>et al</i>., 1997). Many of the practices 
  advocated for soil C conservation &#150; reduced tillage, more vegetative cover, 
  greater use of perennial crops &#150; also prevent erosion, yielding possible 
  benefits for improved water and air quality (Cole <i>et al</i>., 1993). As a result 
  of these benefits, adoption of practices that promote C conservation in agricultural 
  lands is often justified even without the additional benefits arising from CO<sub>2</sub> 
  mitigation.</p>
<p>Soil carbon sequestration, however, may sometimes have some potential adverse 
  effects on the emission of other GHGs, notably nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). Where the 
  C accumulation requires addition of higher amounts of N as fertilizer or manure, 
  it carries the risk of increased N<sub>2</sub>O emissions (Cole <i>et al</i>., 1993; Batjes, 1998). 
  Furthermore, some C-conserving practices like reduced tillage may increase N<sub>2</sub>O 
  emissions by favouring higher soil moisture content (Cole <i>et al</i>., 1993; MacKenzie 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997; Ball <i>et al</i>., 1999), though this effect is not always observed 
  (e.g., Jacinthe and Dick, 1997; Lemke <i>et al</i>., 1999). Because the radiative forcing 
  of N<sub>2</sub>O is about 310 times that of CO<sub>2</sub> (kg per kg), when calculated 
  over a 100-year time frame (IPCC, 1996), even a small increase in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, 
  if confirmed, can significantly offset gains from C sequestration.</p>
<p>Carbon sequestration strategies may also have an effect on energy use and, 
  hence, CO<sub>2</sub> emission from fossil fuel use. Changes in fertilizer use, 
  pesticides, and agricultural machinery may enhance or offset any gains in soil 
  C because of CO<sub>2</sub> released from fossil fuel. For example, roughly 
  1 kgC (or more) is released into the atmosphere as CO<sub>2</sub> per kgN used 
  (Flach <i>et al</i>., 1997; Janzen el al., 1998; Schlesinger, 1999). In tropical areas 
  where shifting cultivation is now practiced, intensification of crop production 
  may maintain higher C stocks, by leaving more land under natural forest, but 
  additional fossil fuel may have to be used to compensate for the fuelwood previously 
  collected from the fallow period (van Noordwijk <i>et al</i>., 1997). In some cases, 
  the adoption of C-conserving practices may reduce energy use. For example, using 
  less intensive tillage may not only favour soil C gains, but also permits savings 
  in CO<sub>2</sub> emission from fossil fuel combustion (Kern and Johnson, 1993). 
  An evaluation of the net benefit of a C-sequestering practice, therefore, must 
  consider energy use in addition to changes in C stocks. Whereas the duration 
  of soil C gain in response to improved management may be finite, savings in 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from energy use continue indefinitely (Cole <i>et al</i>., 
  1997). </p>
<p>Aside from their secondary effects on GHG emissions, practices that sequester 
  soil C may also have other potential adverse effects, at least in some regions 
  or conditions. Possible effects include enhanced contamination of groundwater 
  with nutrients or pesticides via leaching under reduced tillage (Cole <i>et al</i>., 
  1993; Isensee and Sadeghi, 1996), and possible environmental effects from widespread 
  application of manures or sludges (Batjes, 1998). These possible negative effects, 
  however, have not been widely confirmed nor quantified, and the extent to which 
  they may offset the environmental benefits of C sequestration is uncertain.</p>
