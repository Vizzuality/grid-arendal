<h2>7.7 Conclusions on Further Needs for Research </h2>
<p>It can be concluded generally that, since SAR (IPCC, 1996a, 1996b) was published, 
  much progress has been achieved in the development of consistent and transparent 
  approaches to assess climate change mitigation costs. This has facilitated understanding 
  of the differences in mitigation cost results generated by different modelling 
  approaches, based on different assumptions. A number of new research topics 
  have been considered particularly important in the establishment of more information 
  about globally efficient and fair climate change mitigation policies. These 
  issues include a better understanding of the relationship between economic costs 
  of climate change mitigation policies and the sustainable development implications 
  in different parts of the world. Specifically, a number of key research issues 
  for further work include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Development and application of methodological approaches for the integrated 
    assessment of linkages between climate change mitigation costs and sustainable 
    development, including development, environment, and social dimensions: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>assessment of macroeconomic impacts using different welfare measures, 
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>co-benefit studies, and <br>
      </li>
      <li>assessment of equity impacts (intragenerational equity impacts should 
        be represented as detailed studies of distributional impacts, and can 
        be integrated as formal decision criteria in policy assessments).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Development of a framework for the assessment of intra- and intergenerational 
    equity aspects of climate change mitigation studies.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Integration of environmental impact assessments in climate change mitigation 
    studies. This will require the development of consistent methodological approaches 
    and empirical studies.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Establishment of approaches to conduct implementation cost analysis in both 
    top-down and bottom-up models.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Implementation cost studies that reflect financial market conditions, institutional 
    and human capacities, information requirements, market size and opportunities 
    for technology gain and learning, economic incentives, and policy instruments.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Development of a systematic approach for reporting baseline assumptions 
    and the costs of moving from one specific baseline case to a climate change 
    mitigation policy.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Further development of a consistent analytical structure and a format for 
    reporting the main assumptions that underlie costing results, including:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>main scenario drivers: economic growth, technological development, sectoral 
        activity, and fuel prices;<br>
      </li>
      <li>behavioural assumptions;<br>
      </li>
      <li>flexibility of climate change mitigation policies, including timing 
        of the reduction policies, GHG emissions included, and international co-operative 
        mechanisms; and<br>
      </li>
      <li>assumptions about tax recycling options, side-impacts of climate change 
        mitigation policies, and the potential implementation of no regrets options.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Development of approaches to and conduct of studies for developing countries 
    and EITs that better reflect the specific characteristics of these economies 
    in implementing climate change mitigation policies. Some of the major research 
    topics are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>assessment of alternative development patterns and their relationship 
        to development, social, and environmental sustainability dimensions;<br>
      </li>
      <li>macroeconomic studies that consider structural adjustment policies and 
        market transformation processes;<br>
      </li>
      <li>studies of the informal sector and implications for GHG emissions and 
        reduction policies;<br>
      </li>
      <li>non-commercial energy use; and<br>
      </li>
      <li>specific implementation policy issues.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Estimates of future costs and sustainability implications that both reflect 
    how climate change might affect future ecosystems, how these altered ecosystems 
    might affect the demand for different goods, and how this demand might affect 
    the welfare of our descendants.</li>
</ul>
