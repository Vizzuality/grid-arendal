<h3>10.3.3 Technology Transfer </h3>
<p>Technology transfer has broadly been discussed in the IPCC Special Report on 
  Technology Transfer (IPCC, 2000a). The report provides a framework for analysis 
  of the complex and multifaceted nature of the technology transfer process, emphasizing 
  the sustainable development perspective. It examines broad trends of technology 
  transfer in recent years, explores the international political context, discusses 
  policy tools for overcoming key barriers and creating enabling environments, 
  and provides an overview of financing and partnerships. The report also includes 
  sectoral perspectives on the transfer of adaptation and mitigation technologies. 
  These perspectives are illustrated by a wide variety of case studies. This section 
  highlights the main findings of the IPCC report, especially those issues related 
  to the role that the main stakeholders must play in the formulation and implementation 
  of policies that facilitate technology transfer.</p>
<h4><a name="10331"></a>10.3.3.1 The View of Technology Transfer</h4>
<p>The effectiveness of measures to mitigate or adapt to climate change depends 
  to a great extent on technological innovation and the diffusion of technologies. 
  The transfer and/or diffusion of ESTs across and within countries is now considered 
  a major element of global strategies to achieve climate stabilization and support 
  sustainable development. At the same time, it is recognized that transferred 
  technologies must meet the needs and priorities of specific local circumstances.</p>
<p>The term technology transfer is interpreted by some as a one-time transaction 
  that maintains the dependency of the recipient. Some analysts therefore prefer 
  the notion of technology co-operation or technology diffusion, which is seen 
  by them as reflecting a process of technical change brought about by dispersed 
  and uncoordinated decisions over time. Others still may see technology transfer 
  as a two-way learning process that might more appropriately be called technology 
  communication. According to the definition used by IPCC (2000a), &#147;technology 
  transfer encompasses the broad set of processes that cover the flows of knowledge, 
  experience, and equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change among 
  different stakeholders. These include governments, international organizations, 
  private sector entities, financial institutions, NGOs and research and/or education 
  institutions. It comprises the process of learning to understand, utilize, and 
  replicate the technology, including the capacity to choose it, adapt it to local 
  conditions, and integrate it with indigenous technologies.&#148; Technology 
  transfer will therefore be used as a broad term including all aspects mentioned 
  above.</p>
<p>While technology transfer is now a common feature of all sectors of human activity, 
  some features are unique to the area of climate change, including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>scale, both in terms of geography, which may involve all countries of the 
    world, and the number of technologies, which could easily run into the thousands;<br>
  </li>
  <li>number of persons that might benefit from the success of these efforts, 
    since the whole world is expected to be the beneficiary; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>payback periods for the R&amp;D expenditures, which may be too long to be 
    of interest to the private sector.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features determine technology transfer activities that could be evaluated 
  at several levels&#151;international, macro- or national, sector-specific, and 
  project-specific levels&#151;and that could follow different pathways according 
  the interactions among the stakeholders involved in the transfer process. Each 
  pathway represents different types of flows of knowledge, moneys, goods, and 
  services among different sets of stakeholders. Each one has very different implications 
  for the learning that occurs and, ultimately, the degree of technology-as-knowledge 
  transfer that takes places beyond the simple hardware transfers.</p>
