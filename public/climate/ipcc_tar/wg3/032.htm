<h1>7 Costing Methodologies</h1>
<h2><a name="71"></a>7.1 Conceptual Basis</h2>
<p>Using resources to mitigate greenhouse gases (GHGs) generates opportunity costs 
  that should be considered to help guide reasonable policy decisions. Actions 
  taken to abate GHG emissions or to increase carbon sinks divert resources from 
  other alternative uses. Assessing the costs of these actions should ideally 
  consider the total value that society attaches to the goods and services forgone 
  because of the diversion of resources to climate protection. In some cases, 
  the sum of benefits and costs will be negative, meaning that society gains from 
  undertaking the mitigation action.</p>
<p>This section addresses the methodological issues that arise in the estimation 
  of the monetary costs of climate change. The focus is on the correct assessment 
  of the costs of mitigation measures to reduce the emissions of GHGs. The assessment 
  of costs and benefits should be based on a systematic analytical framework to 
  ensure comparability and transparency of estimates. One well-developed framework 
  assesses costs as changes in social welfare based on individual values. These 
  individual values are reflected by the willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental 
  improvements or the willingness to accept (WTA) compensation. From these value 
  measures can be derived measures such as the social surpluses gained or lost 
  from a policy, the total resource costs, and opportunity costs. </p>
<p>While the underlying measures of welfare have limits and using monetary values 
  remains controversial, the view is taken that the methods to &#147;convert&#148; 
  non-market inputs into monetary terms provide useful information for policymakers. 
  These methods should be pursued when and where appropriate. It is also considered 
  useful to supplement this welfare-based cost methodology with a broader assessment 
  that includes equity and sustainability dimensions of climate change mitigation 
  policies. In practice, the challenge is to develop a consistent and comprehensive 
  definition of the key impacts to be measured. </p>
<p>A frequent criticism of this costing method is that it is inequitable, as it 
  gives greater weight to the &#147;well off&#148;. This is because, typically, 
  a well-off person has a greater WTP or WTA than a less well-off person and hence 
  the choices made reflect more the preferences of the better off. This criticism 
  is valid, but there is no coherent and consistent method of valuation that can 
  replace the existing one in its entirety. Concerns about, for example, equity 
  can be addressed along with the basic cost estimation. The estimated costs are 
  one piece of information in the decision-making process for climate change that 
  can be supplemented with other information on other social objectives, for example 
  impacts on key stakeholders and the meeting of poverty objectives. <br>
  <br>
  In this section the costing methodology is overviewed, and issues involved in 
  using these methods addressed.</p>
