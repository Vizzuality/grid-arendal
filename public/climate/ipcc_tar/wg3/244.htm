<h4>6.2.2.6.4 Demand-side Management</h4>
<p>Information programmes are often applied in combination with other initiatives 
  (such as rebating in DSM programmes, energy audits, labelling, and regulation). 
  In the US cumulative electric utility DSM spending to date is about US$15&#150;20 
  billion. Close to 60% of utility customers are served by such programmes. Reductions 
  in national electricity demand of 3%&#150;4% percent were achieved with these 
  programmes (Hadley and Hirst, 1995; Eto <i>et al</i>., 1996). Studies on the efficiency 
  of DSM programmes find that a large proportion of the reported conservation 
  impacts are statistically observable after accounting for economic and weather 
  effects (Parfomak and Lave, 1997).</p>
<p>With utility restructuring and the emergence of electricity generation competition, 
  the rationale of utility resource acquisition has been greatly diminished. The 
  new generation of programmes funded by SBCs emphasizes permanent market transformation 
  effects aimed at technology manufacturers, including financial incentives paid 
  directly to manufacturers, guaranteed minimum market sales for new energy efficient 
  products, and competitive technology procurement programmes.</p>

    <td class="box"><b>Box 6.8. Renewable Energy Policy in India </b> 
      <p>Renewable energy (RE) sources were first recognized and incorporated 
        in official policy documents in the early 1970s. Several national-level 
        programmes for RE technologies have been initiated, for example, the National 
        Project for Biogas Development (NPBD) with a target of 1.5 million plants 
        by 2001, a national programme for improved cook-stoves, a programme for 
        mass demonstration of RE sources like wind, solar, biomass, etc. The Ministry 
        of Non-conventional Energy Sources (MNES) co-ordinates and implements 
        the RE policy at the national level with counter-part departments in the 
        state governments. The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) 
        operates a revolving fund for development, promotion, and commercialization 
        of RE through the provision of soft term financial assistance.</p>
      <p>Under the New Strategy and Action Plan for RE, the following, two-pronged 
        action plan was devised:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High priority accorded to generation of grid-quality power from wind 
          energy, small hydropower, bio-energy and solar energy.</li>
        <li>Rural energization programme is promoted through: 
          <ul>
            <li> electrification of villages through photovoltaic and biomass 
              gasifier power systems,<br>
            </li>
            <li> supply of solar lanterns to unelectrified households,<br>
            </li>
            <li> use of solar water heating systems, <br>
            </li>
            <li> rural energy programmes, for example, National Project on Biogas 
              Development,<br>
            </li>
            <li> production of energy from agricultural waste, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Currently, a three-fold strategy has been pursued by the government for 
        promotion of RE sources through private sector involvement. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing budgetary resources by government for demonstration projects.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Extending institutional finance from IREDA and other financial institutions 
          for commercially viable projects, with private sector participation; 
          and external assistance from international and bilateral agencies. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Promoting private investment through fiscal incentives, tax holidays, 
          depreciation allowance, facilities for wheeling and banking of power 
          for the grid and remunerative returns for power provided to the grid. 
          The emphasis has shifted from direct financial incentives (e.g., subsidies) 
          to indirect fiscal incentives (e.g., low interest loans, financing packages 
          for consumers, reduced tariff and taxes, viable power-purchase prices, 
          etc.). Some fiscal incentives include: accelerated 100% depreciation 
          on specified renewable energy based devices/projects, 100% tax deduction 
          from profits and gains for first five years of operation, and 30% for 
          the next five years for industrial undertakings set up for generation 
          and/or distribution of power.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The new policy for RE tried to give a focus on commercialization and, 
        market orientation and to encourage greater private sector involvement. 
        Despite this there exists significant unexploited potential. The main 
        barriers are: high initial and transaction costs, underdeveloped markets 
        and market-support infrastructure for RE products, weak linkages between 
        market development and R&amp;D, product development not responsive to 
        users&#146; needs, and the pricing of conventional energy sources (TERI, 
        2000).</p>
