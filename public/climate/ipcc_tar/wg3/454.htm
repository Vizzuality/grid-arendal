<p><b>AAU<br>
  </b> <i>See</i><b><i> assigned amount unit.</i><br>
  <br>
  Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ)</b><br>
  The pilot phase for <i><b>joint implementation</b></i>, as defined in Article 
  4.2(a) of the <b><i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</i></b>, 
  that allows for project activity among developed countries (and their companies) 
  and between developed and developing countries (and their companies). AIJ is 
  intended to allow Parties to the <i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
  Change</i> to gain experience in jointly implemented project activities. There 
  is no crediting for AIJ activity during the pilot phase. A decision remains 
  to be taken on the future of AIJ projects and how they may relate to the Kyoto 
  Mechanisms. As a simple form of tradable permits, AIJ and other market-based 
  schemes represent important potential mechanisms for stimulating additional 
  resource flows for the global environmental good. See also<b><i> Clean Development 
  Mechanism, and emissions trading</i></b>.</p>
<p><b>Adaptation</b><br>
  Adjustment in natural or human systems to a new or changing environment. Adaptation 
  to <b><i>climate change</i></b> refers to adjustment in natural or human systems 
  in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates 
  harm or exploits beneficial opportunities. Various types of adaptation can be 
  distinguished, including anticipatory and reactive adaptation, private and public 
  adaptation, and autonomous and planned adaptation.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Additionality<br>
  </b>Reduction in <b><i>emissions</i></b> by <i><b>sources</b></i> or enhancement 
  of removals by sinks that is additional to any that would occur in the absence 
  of a <b><i>Joint Implementation</i></b> or a<b><i> Clean Development Mechanism</i></b> 
  project activity as defined in the <b><i>Kyoto Protocol </i></b>Articles on 
  <b> <i>Joint Implementation</i></b> and the <b><i>Clean Development Mechanism</i></b>. 
  This definition may be further broadened to include financial, investment, and 
  <b> <i>technology</i></b> additionality. Under <i>financial additionality</i>, 
  the project activity funding shall be additional to existing Global Environmental 
  Facility, other financial commitments of Parties included in Annex I, Official 
  Development Assistance, and other systems of co-operation. Under <i>investment 
  additionality</i>, the <i><b>value</b></i> of the <b><i>Emissions Reduction 
  Unit /Certified Emission Reduction Unit</i></b> shall significantly improve 
  the financial and/or commercial viability of the project activity. Under<i> 
  technology additionality</i>, the technology used for the project activity shall 
  be the best available for the circumstances of the host Party.</p>
<p><b>Administrative costs<br>
  </b>The costs of activities of the project or sectoral activity directly related 
  and limited to its short-term implementation. They include the costs of planning, 
  training, administration, monitoring, etc.</p>
<p><b>Afforestation<br>
  </b>Planting of new forests on lands that historically have not contained forests<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnapp2.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>2</sup></small></a>.

  AIJ<br>
  </b><i>See</i><b><i> Activities Implemented Jointly.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS)</b><br>
  The group was formed during the Second World Climate Conference in 1990 and 
  comprises small island and low-lying coastal developing countries that are particularly 
  vulnerable to the adverse consequences of <i><b>climate change</b></i>, such 
  as sea level rise, coral bleaching, and the increased frequency and intensity 
  of tropical storms. With more than 35 states from the Atlantic, Caribbean, Indian 
  Ocean, Mediterranean, and Pacific, AOSIS share common objectives on environmental 
  and sustainable development matters in the <b><i>UNFCCC</i></b> (<b><i>United 
  Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</i></b>) process.</p>
<p><b>Alternative development paths</b><br>
  Refer to a variety of possible scenarios for societal values and consumption 
  and production patterns in all countries, including but not limited to a continuation 
  of today&#146;s trends. In this Report, these paths do not include additional 
  climate initiatives which means that no scenarios are included that explicitly 
  assume implementation of the <i><b>UNFCCC</b></i> or the emission targets of 
  the <b><i>Kyoto Protocol</i></b>, but do include assumptions about other policies 
  that influence greenhouse gas emissions indirectly.</p>
<p><b>Alternative energy</b><br>
  Energy derived from non-fossil fuel sources.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Ancillary benefits</b><br>
  The ancillary, or side effects, of policies aimed exclusively at <b><i>climate 
  change mitigation</i></b>. Such policies have an impact not only on <b><i>greenhouse 
  gas emissions</i></b>, but also on resource use efficiency, like reduction in 
  emissions of local and regional air pollutants associated with fossil fuel use, 
  and on issues such as transportation, agriculture, <b><i>land-use</i></b> practices, 
  employment, and fuel security. Sometimes these benefits are referred to as &#147;ancillary 
  impacts&#148; to reflect that in some cases the benefits may be negative. From 
  the perspective of policies directed at abating local air pollution, <b><i>greenhouse 
  gas mitigation</i></b> may also be considered an ancillary benefit, but these 
  relationships are not considered in this assessment. See also <b><i>co-benefits</i></b>.</p>
<p><b>Anthropogenic emissions</b><br>
  <i><b>Emissions</b></i> of <i><b>greenhouse gases</b></i>, <i>greenhouse gas</i> 
  precursors, and aerosols associated with human activities. These include burning 
  of<i><b> fossil fuels</b></i> for energy, <i><b>deforestation</b></i> and <i><b>land-use</b></i> 
  changes that result in net increase in emissions. </p>
<p><b>Annex I countries/Parties</b><br>
  Group of countries included in Annex I (as amended in 1998) to the <b><i>United 
  Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</i></b>, including all the developed 
  countries in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, and 
  <b> <i>Economies in transition</i></b>. By default, the other countries are 
  referred to as <b><i>Non-Annex I countries</i></b>. Under Articles 4.2 (a) and 
  4.2 (b) of the Convention, Annex I countries commit themselves specifically 
  to the aim of returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels of<b><i> 
  greenhouse gas emissions</i></b> by the year 2000. See also <b><i>Annex II</i></b>, 
  <i> <b>Annex B</b></i>, and <i><b>Non-Annex B</b></i> <i><b>countries</b></i>.</p>
<p><b>Annex II countries</b><br>
  Group of countries included in Annex II to the <i><b>United Nations Framework 
  Convention on Climate Change</b></i>, including all developed countries in the 
  Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development. Under Article 4.2 (g) 
  of the Convention, these countries are expected to provide financial resources 
  to assist developing countries to comply with their obligations, such as preparing 
  national reports. Annex II countries are also expected to promote the transfer 
  of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries. See also<b><i> 
  Annex I, Annex B, Non-Annex I</i></b>, and <b><i>Non-Annex B countries/Parties</i></b>.</p>
<p><b>Annex B countries/Parties</b><br>
  Group of countries included in Annex B in the <b><i>Kyoto Protocol</i></b> that 
  have agreed to a target for their <b><i>greenhouse gas emissions</i></b>, including 
  all the <b><i>Annex I countries </i></b>(as amended in 1998) but Turkey and 
  Belarus. See also <b><i>Annex II, Non-Annex I, and Non-Annex B countries/Parties</i></b>.<br>
  <br>
  <b>AOSIS</b><br>
  <i>See</i><b><i> Alliance of Small Island States.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Assigned amounts (AAs)</b><br>
  Under the <i><b>Kyoto Protocol</b></i>, the total amount of <b><i>greenhouse 
  gas emissions</i></b> that each <i><b>Annex B country</b></i> has agreed that 
  its emissions will not exceed in the first commitment period (2008 to 2012) 
  is the assigned amount. This is calculated by multiplying the country&#146;s 
  total <i>greenhouse gas emissions</i> in 1990 by five (for the 5-year commitment 
  period) and then by the percentage it agreed to as listed in Annex B of the 
  Kyoto Protocol (e.g., 92% for the European Union; 93% for the USA).</p>
<p><b>Assigned amount unit (AAU)</b><br>
  Equal to 1 tonne (metric ton) of <i><b>CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions</b></i> 
  calculated using the <b><i>Global Warming Potential</i></b>.</p>
<p><b>Average cost</b><br>
  <i><b>Total cost</b></i> divided by the number of units of the item for which 
  the cost is being assessed. With <b><i>greenhouse gases</i></b>, for example, 
  it would be the total cost of a programme divided by the physical quantity of 
  <i> <b>emissions</b></i> avoided.</p>
