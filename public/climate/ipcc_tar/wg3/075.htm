<h4>2.3.2.2 Characteristics of Stabilization Scenarios</h4>
<p>The stabilization scenarios that were estimated based on the above baselines 
  also have a very wide range, as shown in <a href="074.htm#fig23">Figure 2.3</a>. 
  This wide range is caused by several factors, including differences in emission 
  time-paths for the stabilization, differences in timing of the stabilization 
  at 550 ppmv, and different carbon cycle models used to assess the stabilization. 
</p>
<p>The divergence in reduction time-path has been discussed based on two sets 
  of popular scenarios. One is a set of IPCC Working Group (WG) I scenarios (Houghton 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996) which is sometimes referred to as &#147;early action scenarios&#148; 
  and denoted as &#147;WGI&#148;; the other is a set of scenarios published by 
  Wigley <i>et al.</i> (1996), sometimes referred to as &#147;delayed action scenarios&#148; 
  and denoted &#147;WRE&#148;. <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> explains that 
  these terms are misleading, since WRE scenarios may not assume early emissions 
  reductions, but do assume early actions to facilitate such reductions later. 
  <a href="074.htm#fig23">Figure 2.3</a> compares the 550 ppmv stabilization scenarios 
  of these two scenario sets with the reviewed scenarios, and it shows that scenarios 
  reviewed here cover a wider range than that of the WGI and WRE scenarios. While 
  the RICE and MERGE scenarios show late reduction (WRE type) trajectories, the 
  CETA, MARIA and MIT scenarios show more severe reduction (WGI type) trajectories.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
  A few scenarios, for example ICAM2, show no drastic reduction even in the latter 
  half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Most of the scenarios have emissions trajectories 
  that lie in between.</p>
<p>The reduction time-path of emissions is a controversial point, which is closely 
  related to the intergenerational equity issue. However, no conclusion can be 
  drawn from such global trajectories, since behind them lies a distribution between 
  countries and the political, technical, economic, and social acceptability of 
  this distribution would depend on how the equity concerns are sorted out.</p>

<p><a href="#fig26">Figures 2.6</a> and <a href="#fig27">2.7</a> show energy-related 
  CO<sub>2</sub> reduction at the global and the non-OECD levels, respectively, 
  which were estimated for each scenario source by subtracting stabilization scenario 
  emissions (<a href="074.htm#fig23">Figure 2.3</a>) from baseline scenario emissions 
  (<a href="074.htm#fig22">Figure 2.2</a>). These figures show that the range 
  of reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for 550ppmv stabilization is also very wide 
  both at the global and the non-OECD levels. This wide range is apparently caused 
  by the divergent baseline scenarios shown in <a href="074.htm#fig22">Figure 
  2.2</a>, while other factors such as differences in emission time-path, in timing 
  of stabilization and in the carbon cycle model used also tend to increase the 
  range.</p>
<p><a href="#fig26">Figures 2.6</a> and <a href="#fig27">2.7</a> show the simulation 
  results of models, assuming that non-OECD countries would participate in mitigation. 
  The distribution of mitigation among the countries is based on different approaches, 
  such as the introduction of emission caps, or the assumption of the same rate 
  of emission reduction for all countries, or global emission trading. The results 
  show that emission trading may lower the mitigation cost, and could lead to 
  more mitigation in the non-OECD countries. </p>
<p>The regional allocation of reductions is a controversial and highly political 
  issue from the equity viewpoint. Mostly, modellers do not explicitly state the 
  burden-sharing rule. Nevertheless, the emission reduction from baseline by the 
  non-Annex I countries is a good indicator of when it is assumed that these countries 
  start sharing the reductions. The data set used in this analysis is limited 
  in the sense that models have different regional specifications; it was therefore 
  difficult to obtain a large number of data points to analyze non-Annex I emissions. 
  As a proxy, emission reduction from the baseline by the non-OECD region is used, 
  which includes Russia and Eastern Europe. This is shown in <a href="#fig27">Figure 
  2.7</a>. In part of the AIM, MiniCAM, FUND, and PEF scenarios, introduction 
  of climate policy in the non-OECD region is assumed not to begin by 2010. Although 
  Russia and Eastern European countries are included in the Kyoto Protocol, the 
  models do assume that because of the decreased emissions in these countries 
  since 1990, actual climate policies would not be needed until 2010. Some scenarios 
  show that non-OECD regions may not have to significantly reduce emissions before 
  2030. However, there are still other scenarios that show an opposite picture. 
  The RICE, MERGE, MIT, and MARIA scenarios show a very steep increase in emission 
  reduction from baseline levels in the non-OECD region starting very early in 
  the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>One of the ways to explain this divergence in reduction time series is to differentiate 
  the assumptions about trade in these scenarios. Some scenarios assume trade 
  in emission credits, which are allotted initially to each country or region. 
  This allows some countries to purchase emission rights from other countries 
  to minimize the cost of meeting their emission targets. The dotted lines in 
  <a href="#fig27">Figure 2.7</a> show the scenarios that assume trade in emission 
  credits between the Annex I and non-Annex I countries. The scenarios that show 
  an early reduction of emissions in the non-OECD region are included in the trade 
  scenarios, and they assume the OECD region would transfer funds to the non-OECD 
  region via emission credit trading. Most of the other scenarios assume that 
  the non-OECD region would start to introduce reduction policies after 2010.</p>
<p>With regard to overall mitigation, the range of assumed policies is very wide, 
  resulting in a wide range of emission reductions. The additional increase in 
  energy efficiency improvement from the baseline ranges between minus 0.04 and 
  1.56% per year within the sampled data, while the additional reduction in carbon 
  intensity from the baseline is between zero and 3.76% per year. Although it 
  is difficult to identify detailed policy assumptions from the database, the 
  range of these factors suggests divergent policy options among scenarios. These 
  policy options are dependent not only on the level of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, 
  but also on the baseline scenarios that have been used for 550 ppmv stabilization 
  quantification.</p>
<p><a href="#fig28">Figure 2.8 (a)</a> shows the relationship between the effects 
  of efficiency improvement policy in mitigation scenarios and the energy intensity 
  reduction assumption in baseline scenarios. This figure suggests an inverse 
  relationship between them. The implication of this is that scenarios in which 
  there is an assumed adoption of high-efficiency measures in the baseline usually 
  would have less scope for further introduction of efficiency measures in the 
  mitigation scenarios, as compared to scenarios that have a lower level of efficiency 
  improvement in their baseline.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#8","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>8</sup></small></a> 
  As a result, the additional reduction of energy intensity in mitigation scenarios 
  over the base cases would be lower when the assumed energy intensity reduction 
  is high in the base case, and vice versa. In the case of unanticipated technological 
  breakthroughs, of course, this relationship may not hold and one could expect 
  further energy efficiency improvements, even when the baseline has a fair amount 
  of energy efficiency built into it.</p>
<p><a href="#fig28">Figure 2.8 (b)</a> shows the relationship between the effects 
  of decarbonization policies and the carbon intensity reductions assumed in the 
  baseline scenarios. This figure suggests that baseline scenarios with high carbon 
  intensity reductions show larger carbon intensity reductions in their mitigation 
  scenarios, while those with low carbon intensity reductions in the base case 
  show smaller reductions in carbon intensity in their corresponding stabilization 
  cases. This is somewhat counterintuitive and difficult to explain simply on 
  the basis of the results available. One might expect that high carbon intensity 
  reductions in the base case might &#147;use up&#148; decarbonization potential, 
  giving rise to lower additional reduction of carbon intensity in mitigation 
  scenarios. On the other hand, increased investment in low-carbon energy technology 
  in the base case could increase the resource base of low-carbon energy, thereby 
  providing more opportunity to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the stabilization 
  case. The mitigation potential in this direction depends not only on the technology 
  but also, and perhaps more, on the economics and social acceptance of the technology. 
  A closer and more careful analysis of which particular mitigation policies were 
  assumed in constructing the scenario than was possible on the basis of the available 
  information, would reveal the underlying reasons for such a pattern.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="#fig28">Figure 2.8 (c)</a> shows the relationship between 
  macroeconomic costs<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#9","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>9</sup></small></a> 
  in the mitigation scenarios and GDP growth assumptions in the baseline scenarios. 
  No clear relationship is visible, but it can be observed that macroeconomic 
  costs for the world as a whole are estimated to range between 0% and 3.5% of 
  GDP in 2100, while a few simple models estimate more increase in the second 
  half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The GDP loss may or may not be related 
  to the GDP growth assumptions in baselines. For instance, high baseline economic 
  growth would lead to higher emissions of GHGs, which would lead to increased 
  GHG reduction costs compared to the corresponding mitigation scenario for a 
  low-growth baseline. On the other hand, high economic growth could provide increased 
  funds for research and development (R&amp;D) of advanced technologies, which 
  would decrease the cost of GHG reduction. The net cost would depend on the relative 
  strengths of these effects. Another aspect is that the costs are also dependent 
  upon the structure of economies, i.e., economies with high fossil fuel dependence, 
  via either exports or domestic consumption, are likely to experience higher 
  costs compared with economies with relatively lower fossil fuel dependence.</p>
