<h4>7.4.3.2 Technological Spillovers </h4>
<p>The theoretical discussion about spillovers emerging from impacts on industrial 
  competitiveness and industrial reallocation is based on a comparative static 
  framework. When extended to a dynamic context, the production possibility frontiers 
  of industries are assumed to shift outwards in a way determined by technological 
  change in different sectors as a reflection of an endogenous feedback from GHG 
  emission reduction policies on technological change. </p>
<p>There are three routes by which technology policies in one country affect development 
  in other countries or specific sectors. First, R&amp;D may increase the knowledge 
  base and this will be a general benefit for all the users of a technology. Second, 
  increased market access for low-CO<sub>2</sub> technologies, through niche-markets 
  or preferential buyback rates in one country may induce a generic improvement 
  in technology in others. Third, domestic regulations on technology performance 
  and standards, whether imposed or voluntary can create a strong signal for foreign 
  industrial competitors. A paper by Goulder and Schneider (1999) similarly argues 
  that climate change policies bias technical change towards emissions savings. 
</p>
<p>The possibility of a positive technological spillover from GHG emission reduction 
  policies has not been taken into account in any of the global mitigation studies 
  reviewed in <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a>. If this materializes, it could 
  cause further complex shifts of the production possibility frontier, including 
  an outwards shift in the production of the affected goods.</p>
<h3><a name="744"></a>7.4.4 Equity </h3>
<h4><a name="7441"></a>7.4.4.1 Alternative Methods of Addressing Equity Concerns</h4>
<p>A key issue in evaluating climate change policies is their impact on intragenerational 
  equity, in which one impact indicator is the income distributional consequences 
  of the policies seen in a national context or across countries. Other related 
  equity issues are the distributional impacts of avoided climate change damages 
  that emerge as a result of mitigation policies, which is dealt with by the IPCC 
  WGII TAR, and intergenerational equity, which is discussed in <a href="280.htm">Section 
  7.2.4</a>. </p>
<p>There are essentially two ways to deal with intragenerational equity. The first 
  is not to deal with it at all in the benefit&#150;cost analysis, but to report 
  the distributional impacts separately. These can then be taken into account 
  by policymakers as they see fit, or the information can be fed into a multi-criteria 
  analysis that formalizes the ranking of projects with more than one indicator 
  of their performance.</p>
<p>The second method of analysis is to use &#147;income weights&#148;, so that 
  impacts on individuals with low incomes are given greater weight than those 
  on individuals with high incomes. Although a number of analysts do not support 
  the use of such weights, some do and policymakers sometimes find an assessment 
  that uses income weights useful. Hence they are included in this chapter.</p>
<p>The costs of different GHG programmes, as well as any related benefits, belong 
  to individuals from different income classes. Economic cost&#150;benefit analysis 
  has developed a method of weighting the benefits and costs according to who 
  is impacted. This is based on converting changes in income into changes in welfare, 
  and assumes that an addition to the welfare of those on a lower income is worth 
  more an addition of welfare to richer people. More specifically, a special form 
  can be taken for the social welfare function, and a common one that has been 
  adopted is that of Atkinson (1970). He assumes that social welfare is given 
  by the function: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/images/equ7-2.gif"></p>
<p>where:<br>
  <i>W</i> is the social welfare function,<br>
  <i>Y</i>i is the income of individual <i>i</i>,<br>
  <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/images/e.gif" width="9" height="11" border="0"> is the elasticity 
  of social marginal utility of income or inequality aversion parameter, and <br>
  <i>A</i> is a constant.<br>
  <br>
  The social marginal utility of income is defined as: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/images/equ7-3.gif"></p>
<p>Taking per capita national income, <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/images/yline.gif" width="10" height="16" border="0">, 
  as the numeraire, and giving it a value of one gives: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/images/equ7-4.gif"></p>
<p>and</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/images/equ7-5.gif"></p>
<p>In this way the marginal social welfare impact of income changes by individuals 
  is the elasticity of the ratio of the per capita income <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/images/yline.gif" width="10" height="16" border="0"> 
  and the income of individual <i>i</i>, <i>Yi</i>. The marginal social welfare 
  impact of income changes by individual i also can be denoted as SMUi, where 
  SMUi is the social marginal utility of a small amount of income going to individual 
  i relative to income going to a person with the average per capita income. The 
  values of SMUi are, in fact, the weights to be attached to costs and benefits 
  to groups relative to different cost and benefit components.</p>
<p>To apply the method, estimates of <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/images/yline.gif" width="10" height="16" border="0"> 
  and <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/images/e.gif" width="9" height="11" border="0"> are required. 
  The literature contains estimates of the inequality aversion parameter (<img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/images/e.gif" width="9" height="11" border="0">) 
  in the range 1&#150;2 (Murty <i>et al</i>. 1992; Stern, 1977 ). Some recent 
  studies that estimate the value of <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/images/e.gif" width="9" height="11" border="0"> 
  for the Indian economy (Murty <i>et al</i>., 1992) resulted in values in the 
  range 1.75&#150;2.0.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#19","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>19</sup></small></a></p>
