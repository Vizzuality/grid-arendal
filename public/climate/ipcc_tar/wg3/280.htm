<h3>7.2.4 Implementation Costs and Barrier Removal </h3>
<p>All climate change policies necessitate some costs of implementation, that 
  is costs of changes to existing rules and regulations, making sure that the 
  necessary infrastructure is available, training and educating those who are 
  to implement the policy as well those affected by the measures, etc. Unfortunately, 
  such costs are not fully covered in conventional cost analyses. Implementation 
  costs in this context are meant to reflect the more permanent institutional 
  aspects of putting a programme into place and are different to those costs conventionally 
  considered as transaction costs. The latter, by definition, are temporary transition 
  costs. Considerable work needs to be done to quantify the institutional and 
  other costs of programmes, so that the reported figures are a better representation 
  of the true costs that will be incurred if the programmes considered in <a href="224.htm">Chapter 
  6</a> are actually implemented. This section discusses the issues of implementation 
  and the associated costs further.</p>
<p>Several economic and technical studies suggest that there is a large potential 
  for climate change mitigation with no cost or very low cost (see the review 
  on mitigation costing studies given in <a href="319.htm">Chapters 8</a> and 
  <a href="353.htm">9</a> of this report). Low mitigation costs, for example, 
  may result from energy-efficiency improvements relating to end-use savings, 
  as well as from the introduction of more efficient supply technologies. There 
  is also potential for the introduction of renewable energy technologies with 
  low costs, such as wind turbines, biomass combustion, and solar water-heating 
  systems. The implementation of such low-cost options in many cases implies that 
  a number of current institutional failures and market barriers exist and that 
  policies should be implemented to correct these.</p>
<p>Following this, mitigation cost assessment, in addition to the direct costs 
  of the programmes, should consider implementations costs that arise in the following 
  areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>financial market conditions;<br>
  </li>
  <li>institutional and human capacities;<br>
  </li>
  <li>information requirements;<br>
  </li>
  <li>market size and opportunities for technology gain and learning; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>economic incentives needed (grants, subsidies, and taxes).</li>
</ul>
<p>Only some of these implementation conditions can be included in the formal 
  cost assessment carried out for individual mitigation options. It is generally 
  more complicated to design implementation programmes targeted to many individual 
  actors (e.g., a demand-side management (DSM) scheme or a tradable carbon permits 
  scheme) than those with centralized project planning (e.g., large-scale power 
  sector changes). In this context it is important to distinguish between marginal 
  and non-marginal projects, since the latter may well induce significant price 
  effects. </p>
<p>Implementation policies can be separated into small &#147;marginal&#148; efforts 
  (which create an incentive to change specific behaviour or introduce new technologies), 
  and more general policy efforts, like economic instruments or general educational 
  programmes (which work by changing the general market conditions and the capability 
  of the actors). </p>
<p>Whether an implementation policy is &#147;marginal&#148; or &#147;general&#148; 
  depends on the general market conditions, as well as on the whole design of 
  policy instruments targeted towards climate change mitigation. Given a &#147;general&#148; 
  environment in which energy and financial markets are efficient, competitive, 
  and have little government intervention, and in which the institutional context 
  is perceived as favourable for climate change mitigation programmes, the implementation 
  policies need only take the form of information programmes, energy auditing, 
  and other specific regulation efforts. However, if energy prices are heavily 
  subsidized and financial markets are very limited, the implementation policy 
  may require general price reforms, specific grants, and other institutional 
  changes.</p>
<p>Implementation policies of the &#147;marginal&#148; sort can be integrated 
  relatively easily into project or sector-level mitigation assessment. Implementation 
  assessment includes the costs of different kinds of programmes for information, 
  training, institution strengthening, and the introduction of technical standards. 
  The most difficult part of such an assessment relates to the behaviour of the 
  target groups. A detailed amount of information is needed on the behaviour of 
  specific actors, including households and private companies, to design the most 
  effective policy options. <br>
  <br>
  It is difficult to integrate general implementation policies, like price changes, 
  into specific project and sector assessments. For a DSM programme in the commercial 
  lighting sector, implementation costs include information and training programmes, 
  institutional capacity building, and sometimes also &#147;costs&#148; of changing 
  the market conditions (prices and taxes). The costs of general changes in market 
  prices and tax systems can only be assessed at the economy-wide level. The introduction 
  of energy or carbon taxes or the removal of subsidies can cause significant 
  structural effects that, again, change energy demand and technology choice. 
  Thus, the proper full analysis of the implementation costs necessitates an economy-wide 
  analysis that involves, for example, the use of computable general equilibrium 
  (CGE) models and intersectoral macroeconomic models. </p>
<p>To a limited extent, such feedbacks can be integrated into a project- or sector-level 
  mitigation-cost assessment by the use of shadow prices. These shadow prices 
  reflect underlying social valuations of the use of different goods and services 
  by different agents. By estimating them in a suitable manner some of the implementation 
  costs, such as changes in government income or expenditure, or the higher value 
  of foreign exchange, can be captured in the cost analysis. Importantly, however, 
  implementation costs assessed using shadow prices do not pick up factors such 
  as quantitative or physical constraints on the use and allocation of some resources, 
  particularly financial ones.</p>
<p>A framework to assess implementation costs thus includes the costs of project 
  or policy design, institutional and human capacity costs (management and training), 
  information costs, and monitoring costs. The costs of resources involved should, 
  in each case, be based on economic opportunity costs.</p>
