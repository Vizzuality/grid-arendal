<h3>9.2.3 Petroleum and Natural Gas<br>
</h3>
<p>Petroleum and natural gas are discussed in a single section, because they are 
  often produced in the same countries and marketed by the same companies. In 
  terms of value, petroleum is the largest single commodity traded on the world 
  market. Coal, by comparison, is typically used in the country in which it is 
  produced. Approximately 55% of the oil produced worldwide is exported, compared 
  with 20% for gas and 12% for hard coal. The three fuels have quite different 
  patterns of demand and different carbon contents per unit of useful energy.<br>
</p>
<h4>9.2.3.1 Petroleum</h4>
<p>Global production of crude oil in 1998 totalled 3,516Mt (approx. 147EJ). In 
  1997, 56% of oil was consumed in the transport sector, up from 42% in 1973 (IEA, 
  1997b). The emission scenarios in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
  (IPCC) Special Report (Nakicenovic <i><i>et al</i></i>., 2000) show a wide range 
  in demand for oil in 2100, from 0.5EJ in the A2 marker scenario to 248EJ in 
  the illustrative scenario A1FI. Cumulative oil use between 1990 and 2100 in 
  scenario A1FI is 29.6ZJ, about 200 times 1998 production, which is close to 
  the combined conventional and unconventional resource base known today (see 
  <a href="089.htm">Chapter 3</a>).<br>
  <br>
  Oil is exported by more than 40 countries worldwide with 11 of which are members 
  of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC accounts for 
  76% of world crude oil reserves, 41% of world production and 55% of world exports 
  (BP Amoco, 1999). On the other hand, around 54% of the world&#146;s downstream 
  refining capacities are in the OECD, which controls 30% of the world&#146;s 
  crude production. The petroleum industry is divided into two sectors, the &#147;upstream&#148; 
  which involves finding and producing crude oil, and the &#147;downstream&#148; 
  which involves refining crude oil into petroleum products and marketing those 
  products to end-users. The distinction between OPEC and/or non-OPEC and upstream 
  and/or downstream aspects of the market and industry is useful in assessing 
  the impact of mitigation on prices, output and wealth.</p>
<h4><a name="92311"></a>9.2.3.1.1 The Global Oil Market</h4>
<p>The market for crude oil is global, and a reduction in demand will affect all 
  exporters via the price mechanism. However, the national economic impact of 
  reduced demand varies greatly depending on the actual cost of production of 
  crude oil and the degree to which the economies of individual producer countries 
  are dependent on oil exports. It should be noted that the cost of production 
  for crude oil can be very different from the market price, which includes royalties 
  paid to government, transportation costs, and profit. Low-cost producers will 
  be able to tolerate declines in the price of crude oil better than high-cost 
  producers will. The more dependent a country is on oil and gas exports, the 
  more its economy will be impacted if the value of these exports decreases.<br>
</p>
<p>Different top-down models have been used to study the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  abatement on the oil market<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#4","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>4</sup></small></a>. 
  Few macroeconomic models have explicitly examined the economic impact of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  abatement on energy-exporting countries. Most of the models (OECD&#146;s computable 
  general equilibrium model (GREEN), OPEC&#146;s world energy model (OWEM), the 
  IEA model, the international integrated assessment model (IIAM), and Whalley 
  and Wigle&#146;s model (WW)) cover different world geographic regions or country 
  groupings. <br>

<p><a name="fig91"></a>Wit (1995) surveys such models and concludes that they 
  should be treated with caution, as hardly any of the global models have been 
  constructed primarily to examine the economic impact of CO<sub>2</sub>-abatement 
  policies on energy exporters. The sensitivity of the parameters used in the 
  surveyed models is high, which underlines the uncertainties with regard to the 
  results. In three of the models (OWEM, GREEN, and WW) the CO<sub>2</sub>-abatement 
  policies would result in the energy exporters suffering the greatest welfare 
  losses. (See <a href="266.htm">Chapter 7</a> for a discussion on welfare losses.) 
  The cumulative losses of a 1990 CO<sub>2</sub> emissions stabilization target 
  range between 3% to 12% of GDP for energy exporting countries by 2010. <br>
  <br>
  Pershing (2000) also surveys a number of model results for impacts of implementation 
  of the Kyoto Protocol on oil exporting countries (<a href="#tab94">Table 9.4</a>). 
  Direct comparison of the model results is difficult, because each model uses 
  a different measure of impact, and many use different groups of countries in 
  their definition of oil exporters. However, the studies all show that use of 
  the flexibility mechanisms will reduce the economic cost to oil producers.</p>

      emission permits with revenues recycled through lump-sum payments to consumers; 
      no ancillary benefits, such as reductions in local air pollution damages, 
      are taken into account in the results. See Weyant (1999).<br>

<p>These and other studies show a wide range of estimates for the impact of GHG 
  mitigation policies on oil production and revenue. Much of these differences 
  are attributable to the assumptions made about: the availability of conventional 
  oil reserves, the degree of mitigation required, the use of emission trading, 
  control of GHGs other than CO<sub>2</sub>, and the use of carbon sinks. However, 
  all studies show net growth in both oil production and revenue to at least 2020. 
  As Pershing (2000) points out, these studies show significantly less impact 
  on the real price of oil than has resulted from market fluctuations over the 
  past 30 years. This feature (well-established) is illustrated in <a href="#fig91">Figure 
  9.1</a>. This figure shows the projection of real oil prices to 2010 from the 
  IEA&#146;s 1998 World Energy Outlook (IEA, 1998b) and the effect of implementing 
  the Kyoto Protocol from the G-cubed study (McKibbin <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1999, 
  p. 326), the study which shows the largest fall in OPEC revenues in <a href="#tab94">Table 
  9.4</a>. The 25% loss in OPEC revenues in the non-trading scenario implies a 
  17% fall in oil prices shown for 2010 in the figure; this is reduced to a fall 
  of just over 7% with Annex B trading. </p>
