<h3>6.1.5 The Political Economy of National Instrument Choice </h3>
<p>Some of the key lessons from the scholarly literature on political economy 
  can be applied to instrument choice in climate policy at the national level. 
  Since much of that scholarship focuses on policymaking in a limited set of developed 
  nations, in particular in the USA, great care must be taken before applying 
  any of these lessons to domestic politics generally.</p>
<h4><a name="6151"></a>6.1.5.1 Key Lessons from the Political Economy Literature</h4>
<p>A useful starting-point is to view the policy process (at least in countries 
  with strong legislatures) as analogous to a &#147;political market&#148; (Keohane 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). The demand side of such a &#147;market&#148; consists of the 
  interest groups with a stake in the policy; in the environmental arena, such 
  groups include regulated industries, producers of complementary products, environmental 
  organizations, and (to a lesser extent) labour and consumer organizations. The 
  supply side consists of the legislators and the administration involved in the 
  design and implementation of the environmental policies and measures.</p>
<p>One key insight of this literature is that some forms of regulation can actually 
  benefit the regulated industry, for example, by limiting entry into the industry 
  or imposing higher costs on new entrants (Rasmusen and Zupan, 1991; Stigler, 
  1971). In the environmental arena, conventional regulation may provide firms 
  with rents that result from reductions in output and raised prices as a consequence 
  of regulation (Buchanan and Tullock, 1975; Maloney and McCormick, 1982). Stricter 
  standards for new pollution sources benefit existing firms by raising barriers 
  to entry (Nelson <i>et al</i>., 1993). Polluters&#146; self-interest may also help 
  explain the prevalence of tradable permits that have been allocated free (&#147;grandfathered&#148;) 
  when market-based instruments have been used. Permits allocated free to existing 
  firms represent a transfer of rents from government to industry while auctioned 
  permits and emissions taxes generally impose a heavier burden on polluters. 
  Finally, VAs may be the preferred policy approach from industry&#146;s perspective, 
  because these leave more of the initiative with the private sector (at least 
  so it is perceived), which may enhance industry&#146;s chances of capturing 
  rents.</p>
<p>Of course, it is important to recognize that industry may not act monolithically, 
  since policies may have differential distributional impacts within a sector. 
  A policy that imposes costs on industry as a whole might still be supported 
  by firms that would fare better than their competitors. For example, firms that 
  can achieve emissions reductions more cheaply may be more supportive of market-based 
  schemes, such as tradable permits, than their higher-cost competitors (Kerr 
  and Mar&eacute;, 1997). In the realm of global environmental policy, the ban 
  on ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) under the Montreal Protocol was, 
  for instance, supported by those who expected to dominate the market for HFCs, 
  then the leading substitute chemicals (Oye and Maxwell, 1995).</p>
<p>Regulated firms are not the only group with a stake in regulation; opposing 
  interest groups will defend their own interests. Environmental groups, for example, 
  tend to favour stringent targets, although many have opposed market-based instruments 
  out of a philosophical concern that such policies give firms &#147;licenses 
  to pollute&#148; or because of objections to attempts to quantify or monetize 
  the environmental damages from pollution (Kelman, 1981; Hahn, 1989; Sandel, 
  1997). Some groups draw an ethical distinction between taxes and tradable permit 
  systems, in which taxes are morally deficient because they put a price on emissions 
  but set no upper limit on allowable pollution, while permits ensure a set level 
  of emissions (Goodin, 1994). Other environmental groups support market-based 
  policies in the hope that the resultant cost savings will make a higher level 
  of environmental quality politically attainable, and possibly in part because 
  of their own self-interest in distinguishing themselves from other environmental 
  organizations (Svendsen, 1999). The US Clean Air Act defines permits as &#147;limited 
  authorizations to emit&#148;, to avoid limiting the ability to set lower emissions 
  limits, which may also be a response to concerns of the environmental lobby 
  that air should not become private property (Tietenberg, 1998). This indicates 
  that the design of market-based instruments may be flexible enough to accommodate 
  ethical concerns without undermining effectiveness.</p>
<p>While the political economy literature emphasizes the importance of preferences 
  of interest groups, it has tended to neglect the &#147;supply side&#148; of 
  the political equation: the legislators and government officials who ultimately 
  design and implement regulatory policy. Government actors may have their own 
  interests and preferences with respect to policy instruments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ideology or past experience may favour one instrument over another (Kneese 
    and Schulze, 1975; Hahn and Stavins, 1991);<br>
  </li>
  <li>legislators may prefer policies with (large but) hidden costs to those with 
    (small but) visible ones (McCubbins and Sullivan, 1984; Hahn, 1987); and<br>
  </li>
  <li>legislators responsible to local districts may emphasize distributional 
    concerns over efficiency (Shepsle and Weingast, 1984).</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the environmental administration may prefer direct regulation over 
  market-based instruments, not only insofar as they are more familiar with it, 
  but also because it gives them more control, and usually requires a relatively 
  large administrative capacity.</p>
<p>These political factors, however, vary widely among countries. Whether or not 
  a legislature exists, and if so whether in a parliamentary or presidential system, 
  affects the support for particular policy instruments. Whether legislators are 
  elected by district or by party list may affect the political support for different 
  policy instruments as well. Factors such as the extent of interest-group organization 
  and how groups interact with government are also critical&#150;interest groups 
  lobby legislators in some countries, sit on quasi-governmental decision-making 
  bodies in others, are relegated to raising public awareness elsewhere, and in 
  some countries are non-existent. Less tangible cultural and historical factors 
  can also be critical in influencing the choice of instrument. For example, a 
  country&#146;s experience with free markets generally may influence whether 
  or not it chooses to use market-based policy instruments for environmental protection 
  (Keohane, 1998). Finally, there are clear political economy limitations of individually 
  applied price, non-price, and regulatory policies that often lead to the linked 
  or combined policy strategy that is observed in practice.</p>
