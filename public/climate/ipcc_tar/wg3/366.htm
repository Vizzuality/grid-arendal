<h3>9.2.5 Agriculture and Forestry<br>
</h3>
<p>The sectoral effects of mitigation on agriculture and forestry are described 
  in detail in <a href="155.htm">Chapter 4</a>. This section covers ancillary 
  benefits for agriculture. </p>
<h4>9.2.5.1 Ancillary Benefits for Agriculture from Reduced Air Pollution</h4>
<p>GHG mitigation strategies that also reduce emissions of ozone precursors, i.e., 
  volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), may 
  have ancillary benefits for agriculture. Elevated concentrations of tropospheric 
  ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) are damaging to vegetation and to human health (EPA, 1997). 
  GHG mitigation strategies which increase efficiency in energy use or increase 
  the penetration of non-fossil-fuel energy are likely to reduce NO<sub>x</sub> 
  emissions (the limiting precursor for O<sub>3</sub> formation in non-urban areas) 
  and hence O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in agricultural regions.<br>

<p><a name="fig93"></a>Studies of the adverse impacts of O<sub>3</sub> on agriculture 
  were first conducted in the United States in the 1960s, with major studies in 
  the 1980s (EPA, 1997; Preston <i>et al</i>., 1988) and later in Europe (U.K. 
  DoE, 1997) and Japan (Kobayashi, 1997). These studies indicate that, for many 
  crop species, it is well established that elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations 
  result in a substantial reduction in yield. The US Environmental Protection 
  Agency (EPA) funded the National Crop Loss Assessment Network (NCLAN) from 1980 
  to 1986, which developed O<sub>3</sub> dose-plant response relationships for 
  economically important crop species (Heck <i>et al</i>., 1984a and b). Results 
  of this study are shown in <a href="#fig93">Figure 9.3</a>. The basic NCLAN 
  methodology was used in 9 countries in Europe between 1987 to 1991 on a variety 
  of crops including wheat, barley, beans, and pasture for the European Crop Loss 
  Assessment Network (EUROCLAN) programme. EUROCLAN found yield reductions to 
  be highly correlated with cumulative exposure to O<sub>3</sub> above a threshold 
  of 30-40 parts per billion (ppb) (Fuhrer, 1995).<br>
</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) uses the AOT 40 standard to describe an 
  acceptable O<sub>3</sub> exposure for crops. AOT 40 is defined as the accumulated 
  hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentrations above 40 ppb (80 mg/m<sup>3</sup>) during 
  daylight hours between May and July. Acumulative exposure less than 6000 mg/m<sup>3</sup>.h 
  is necessary to prevent an excess of 5% crop yield loss (European Environment 
  Agency, 1999). Observations indicate that this limit is exceeded in most of 
  Europe with the exception of the northern parts of Scandinavia and the UK (European 
  Environment Agency, 1999). Median summer afternoon O<sub>3</sub> concentrations 
  in the majority of the eastern and southwestern United States presently exceed 
  50 ppb (Fiore <i>et al.</i>, 1998). As shown in <a href="#fig93">Figure 9.3</a> 
  these concentrations will result in yield reductions in excess of 10% for several 
  crops. IPCC Working Group (WG)I (Chapter 4) predicts that, if emissions follow 
  their SRES A2 scenario, by 2100 background O<sub>3</sub> levels near the surface 
  at northern mid-latitudes will rise to nearly 80ppb. (However, scenario B1 has 
  only small increases in O<sub>3</sub> emissions.) At the higher O<sub>3</sub> 
  concentrations the yield of soybeans may decrease by 40%, and the yield of corn 
  and wheat may decrease by 25% relative to crop yields at pre-industrial O<sub>3</sub> 
  levels. Within a crop species, the sensitivity of individual cultivars to O<sub>3</sub> 
  can vary (EPA, 1997), and it is possible that more resistant strains could be 
  utilized. However, this would impose an additional constraint on agriculture.<br>
</p>
<p>An economic assessment of the impact of O<sub>3</sub> on US agriculture, based 
  on data from the NCLAN study, found that when O<sub>3</sub> is reduced by 25% 
  in all regions, the economic benefits are approximately US$1.9billion (bn) (1982 
  dollars) (Adams <i>et al</i>., 1989). Conversely, a 25% increase in O3 pollution 
  resulted in costs of US$2.1bn (Adams <i>et al</i>., 1985). Two recent studies 
  found that crop production may be substantially reduced in the future in China 
  owing to elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (Chameides <i>et al</i>., 1999; 
  Aunan <i>et al</i>., 2000, forthcoming). China&#146;s concerns about food security 
  may make GHG mitigation strategies that reduce surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations 
  more attractive than those that do not. </p>
<h4><a name="9252"></a>9.2.5.2 Ancillary Benefits from Carbon Sequestration<br>
</h4>
<p><a href="089.htm">Chapter 3</a> considers new technologies for using biomass, 
  such as sugar cane, to replace fossil fuels. Such mitigation may have considerable 
  associated benefits, particularly for sustainable development in creating new 
  employment (see <a href="372.htm">9.2.10.4</a> below).</p>
<p>Alig <i>et al</i>. (1997) through modelling alternative carbon flux scenarios 
  using the forestry and agricultural sector optimization model (FASOM) estimated 
  the welfare effects of carbon sequestration for the US. They estimate total 
  social welfare costs to range from US$20.7bn to $50.8bn. In the case of the 
  agricultural sector, the consumer&#146;s surplus decreases in all scenarios.</p>
