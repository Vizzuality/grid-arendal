<h4>3.8.4.4.3 Other Aspects</h4>
<p>If CO<sub>2</sub> is to be stored for mitigation purposes, it is important 
  that the retention time is sufficient to avoid any adverse effect on the climate. 
  It is also important to avoid large-scale accidental releases of CO<sub>2</sub>. 
  It is expected that these goals will be achievable with underground storage 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> and may be achievable with ocean storage. Oil and gas fields 
  have remained secure for millions of years, so they should be able to retain 
  CO<sub>2</sub> for similar timescales, providing extraction of oil or gas or 
  injection of CO<sub>2</sub> does not disrupt the seal. Deep saline reservoirs 
  are generally less well characterized than oil and gas reservoirs because of 
  their lack of commercial importance to date. Their ability to contain CO<sub>2</sub> 
  for the necessary timescales is less certain, but research is underway to improve 
  understanding of this aspect (Williams, 2000). </p>
<p>If CO<sub>2</sub> storage were to be used as a basis for emissions trading 
  or to meet national commitments under the UNFCCC, it would be necessary to establish 
  the quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> stored in a verifiable manner. Most verification 
  requirements for geologically stored CO<sub>2</sub> can be achieved with technology 
  available today. Validation of CO<sub>2</sub> storage in the ocean would be 
  more difficult, but it should be possible to verify quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  stored in concentrated deposits on the seabed.</p>

<h4>3.8.4.4.4 Applicability of Capture and Storage in Other Industries</h4>
<p>The possibility of using CO<sub>2</sub> capture and storage in the manufacturing 
  industry is described in <a href="109.htm#3534">Section 3.5.3.4</a>, including 
  capture of CO<sub>2</sub> during production of hydrogen from fossil fuels. Hydrogen 
  is widely used for ammonia production and in oil refineries, but it can also 
  be used as an energy carrier. Applications would be for small, dispersed, and/or 
  mobile energy users where capture of CO<sub>2</sub> after combustion would not 
  be feasible. Particular examples are in transport e.g., cars and aircraft, and 
  small-scale heat and power production. Production of hydrogen from fossil fuels 
  with CO<sub>2</sub> storage could be an attractive transition strategy to enable 
  the wide-scale introduction of hydrogen as an energy carrier (Turkenburg, 1997; 
  Williams, 1999).</p>
<a name="38445"></a> 
<h4>3.8.4.4.5 The Role of CO<sub>2</sub> Capture and Storage in Mitigation of 
  Climate Change</h4>
<p>Some CO<sub>2</sub> could be captured from anthropogenic sources and stored 
  underground at little or no overall cost, for example where the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  is already available in concentrated form, such as in natural gas treatment 
  plants or in hydrogen or ammonia manufacture. If the captured CO<sub>2</sub> 
  were to be stored in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, such as in enhanced oil 
  recovery schemes, or through enhanced production of coal bed methane, the income 
  produced would also help to offset the costs. Such opportunities are available 
  for early action to combat climate change using technology which is available 
  today.</p>
<p>Substantial quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuel combustion could 
  be captured in the future and sequestered in natural reservoirs (Williams, 2000). 
  Potentially, this approach could achieve deep reductions in emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>. 
  Edmonds <i>et al</i>. (2000) have considered various possible strategies to 
  achieve stabilization of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations around 550-750 ppmv. 
  It has been shown that inclusion of the option of capture and storage of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  offers significant reduction in overall cost compared with strategies which 
  do not include this option.<br>
