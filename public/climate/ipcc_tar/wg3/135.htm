<h4>3.8.4.4.2 Transmission and Storage of CO<sub>2</sub></h4>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> can be transported to storage sites using high-pressure pipelines 
  or by ship. Pipelines are used routinely today to transport CO<sub>2</sub> long 
  distances for use in enhanced oil recovery (Stevens <i>et al</i>., 2000). Although 
  CO<sub>2</sub> is not transported by ship at present, tankers similar to those 
  currently used for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) could be used for this purpose 
  (Ozaki, 1997). </p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> exists in natural underground reservoirs in various parts of 
  the world. Potential sites for storage of captured CO<sub>2</sub> are underground 
  reservoirs, such as depleted oil and gas fields or deep saline reservoirs. CO<sub>2</sub> 
  injected into coal beds may be preferentially absorbed, displacing methane from 
  the coal; sequestration would be achieved providing the coal is never mined. 
  Another possible storage location for captured CO<sub>2</sub> is the deep ocean, 
  but this option is at an earlier stage of development than underground reservoirs; 
  so far only small-scale experiments for preliminary investigation have been 
  carried out (Herzog <i>et al</i>., 2000); the deep ocean is chemically able 
  to dissolve up to 1800GtC (Sato, 1999). An indication of the global capacities 
  of the major storage options is given in <a href="#tab334">Table 3.34</a>. The 
  capacities of these reservoirs are subject to substantial uncertainty, as purposeful 
  exploration has only been conducted in some parts of the world so far. Other 
  published estimates of the global capacity for storage in underground aquifers 
  range up to 14,000GtC (Hendriks, 1994). Other methods of CO<sub>2</sub> storage 
  have been suggested but none are competitive with underground storage (Freund, 
  2000).</p>

<p>Substantial amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> are already being stored in underground 
  reservoirs:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Nearly 1Mt/yr of CO<sub>2</sub> is being stored in a deep saline reservoir 
    about 800m beneath the bed of the North Sea as part of the Sleipner Vest gas 
    production project (Baklid and Korbol, 1996). This is the first time CO<sub>2</sub> 
    has been stored purely for reasons of climate protection. <br>
  <li> About 33Mt/yr of CO<sub>2</sub> is used at more than 74 enhanced oil recovery 
    (EOR) projects in the USA. Most of this CO<sub>2</sub> is extracted from natural 
    CO<sub>2</sub> reservoirs but some is captured from gas processing plants. 
    Much of this CO<sub>2</sub> remains in the reservoir at the completion of 
    oil production; any CO<sub>2</sub> produced with the oil is separated and 
    reinjected. An example of an EOR scheme which will use anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> 
    is the Weyburn project in Canada (Wilson <i>et al</i>., 2000). In this project, 
    5,000 t/d of CO<sub>2</sub> captured in a coal gasification plant in North 
    Dakota, USA will be piped to the Weyburn field in Saskatchewan, Canada. <br>
  <li> At the Allison unit in New Mexico, USA, (Stevens <i>et al</i>., 1999), 
    over 100,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> has been injected over a three-year 
    period to enhance production of coal bed methane. The injected CO<sub>2</sub> 
    is sequestered in the coal (providing it is never mined). This is the first 
    example of CO<sub>2</sub>-enhanced coal bed methane production. 
</ul>
<p>The cost of CO<sub>2</sub> transport and storage depends greatly on the transport 
  distance and the capacity of the pipeline. The cost of transporting large quantities 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> is approximately US$1-3/t per 100km (Ormerod, 1994; Doctor 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000). The cost of underground storage, excluding compression 
  and transport, would be approximately US$1-2/tCO<sub>2</sub> stored (Ormerod, 
  1994). The overall cost of transport and storage for a transport distance of 
  300 km would therefore be about US$8/tCO<sub>2</sub> stored, equivalent to about 
  US$10/t of emissions avoided (US$37/tC). </p>
<p>If the CO<sub>2</sub> is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or enhanced coal 
  bed methane production (ECBM), there is a valuable product (oil or methane, 
  respectively) which would help to offset the cost of CO<sub>2</sub> capture 
  and transport. In some EOR or ECBM projects, the net cost of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  capture and storage might be negative. Other ideas for utilizing CO<sub>2</sub> 
  to make valuable products have not proved to be as useful as sequestration measures, 
  because of the amount of energy consumed in the process and the relatively insignificant 
  quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> which would be used. </p>
<p>If no valuable products were produced, the overall cost of CO<sub>2</sub> capture 
  and storage would be about US$40-60/t CO<sub>2</sub> emissions avoided (150-220/tC). 
  As with most new technologies, there is scope to reduce these costs in the future 
  through technical developments and wider application.<br>
