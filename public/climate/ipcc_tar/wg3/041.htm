<h1>9 Sectoral Costs and Ancillary Benefits of Mitigation</h1>
<h2><a name="91"></a>9.1 Differences between Costs of Climate Change Mitigation 
  Evaluated Nationally and by Sector</h2>
<p>Policies adopted to mitigate global warming will have implications for specific 
  sectors, such as the coal industry, the oil and gas industry, electricity, manufacturing, 
  transportation, and households. A sectoral assessment helps to put the costs 
  in perspective, to identify the potential losers and the extent and location 
  of the losses, and to identify the sectors that may benefit. However, it is 
  worth noting that the available literature to make this assessment is limited: 
  there are few comprehensive studies of the sectoral effects of mitigation, compared 
  with those on the macro GDP effects, and they tend to be for Annex I countries 
  and regions.</p>
<p>There is a fundamental problem for mitigation policies. It is well established 
  that, compared to the situation for potential gainers, the potential sectoral 
  losers are easier to identify, and their losses are likely to be more immediate, 
  more concentrated, and more certain. The potential sectoral gainers (apart from 
  the renewables sector and perhaps the natural gas sector) can only expect a 
  small, diffused, and rather uncertain gain, spread over a long period. Indeed 
  many of those who may gain do not exist, being future generations and industries 
  yet to develop.</p>
<p>It is also well established that the overall effects on GDP of mitigation policies 
  and measures, whether positive or negative, conceal large differences between 
  sectors. In general, the energy intensity and the carbon intensity of the economies 
  will decline. The coal and perhaps the oil industries are expected to lose substantial 
  proportions of their traditional output relative to those in the reference scenarios, 
  though the impact of this on the industries will depend on diversification, 
  and other sectors may increase their outputs but by much smaller proportions. 
  Reductions in fossil fuel output below the baseline will not impact all fossil 
  fuels equally. Fuels have different costs and price sensitivities; they respond 
  differently to mitigation policies. Energy-efficiency technology is fuel and 
  combustion device-specific, and reductions in demand can affect imports differently 
  from output. Energy-intensive sectors, such as heavy chemicals, iron and steel, 
  and mineral products, will face higher costs, accelerated technical or organizational 
  change, or loss of output (again relative to the reference scenario) depending 
  on their energy use and the policies adopted for mitigation. </p>
<p>Industries concerned directly with mitigation are likely to benefit from action. 
  These industries include renewable and nuclear electricity, producers of mitigation 
  equipment (incorporating energy- and carbon-saving technologies), agriculture 
  and forestry producing energy crops, and research services producing energy 
  and carbon-saving R&amp;D. They may benefit in the long term from the availability 
  of financial and other resources that would otherwise have been taken up in 
  fossil fuel production. They may also benefit from reductions in tax burdens 
  if taxes are used for mitigation and the revenues recycled as reductions in 
  employer, corporate, or other taxes. Those studies that report reductions in 
  GDP do not always provide a range of recycling options, suggesting that policy 
  packages increasing GDP have not been explored. The extent and nature of the 
  benefits will vary with the policies followed. Some mitigation policies can 
  lead to net overall economic benefits, implying that the gains from many sectors 
  will outweigh the losses for coal and other fossil fuels, and energy-intensive 
  industries. In contrast, other less-well-designed policies can lead to overall 
  losses.</p>
<p>It is worth placing the task faced by mitigation policy in an historical perspective. 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have tended to grow more slowly than GDP in a number 
  of countries over the past 40 years. The reasons for such trends vary but include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a shift away from coal and oil and towards nuclear and gas as the source 
    of energy;</li>
  <li>improvements in energy efficiency by industry and households; and</li>
  <li>a shift from heavy manufacturing towards more service and information-based 
    economic activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>These trends will be encouraged and strengthened by mitigation policies.</p>
