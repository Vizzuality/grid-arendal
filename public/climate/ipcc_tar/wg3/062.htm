<h3><a name="142"></a>1.4.2 Decoupling Growth from Resource Flows</h3>
<p>A considerable literature has emerged recently on experiences with technologies, 
  practices, and products that increase resource productivity and ecological efficiency, 
  and thereby reduce the volume of resource input per unit of economic output. 
  The ultimate hope is to shed light on ways in which economic growth and social 
  security can be sustained while resource flows decline in developed countries 
  and/or grow more slowly in developing countries. This literature cites macroeconomic 
  trends with relative reductions in the intensity of resource use coupled with 
  slight increases in absolute levels in the developed economies (Adriaanse et 
  al., 1997). It deals with issues that are central to alternative development 
  paths that are also discussed in the SRES (IPCC, 2000a) and <a href="068.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>. It also notes leapfrogging phases of technological development for developing 
  economies (UNDP, 1998, p. 83). On the micro level, it identifies experiences 
  with cleaner, more economical energy systems, and the potential for information 
  technology to increase resource efficiency. In either case, authors uncover 
  policy options that pertain mainly to support the proliferation of these trends. 
  These options emerge from a broader conception of climate mitigation than has 
  typically been captured in the energy supply and demand technologies represented 
  in existing energy&#150;economic models. Each option has the potential to reduce 
  GHG emissions, but each needs to be carefully evaluated in terms of its impacts 
  on economic, social, and biological systems. Moreover, each of these options 
  needs to be evaluated alongside conventional energy supply and demand alternatives 
  in terms of their impacts. Expanding the analysis of the set of available options 
  in this way should make us better off, as some of the new options will be attractive 
  upon further analysis, although others will not.</p>
<h4><a name="1421"></a>1.4.2.1 Eco-intelligent Production Systems</h4>
<p>Many authors argue that progress in developed countries has been driven largely 
  by the technologically based substitution of natural resources for labour. As 
  a result, labour productivity has generally grown faster than resource productivity. 
  Against the background of environmental scarcities, though, this pattern has 
  and will continue to change so that innovation may increasingly be shifted away 
  from labour-saving advances towards resource-saving technologies. </p>
<p>Possibilities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eco-efficient innovation, that is making products in ways that minimize 
    resource content, utilize biodegradable materials, extend durability, and 
    save inputs during use (Stahel, 1994; Fussler, 1996; Weaver<i> et al</i>., 
    2000). </li>
  <li>Industrial ecology, that is moving from the nineteenth century concept of 
    a linear throughput growth&#150;in which materials flow through the economy 
    as if through a straight pipe&#150;to a closed loop economy in which industrial 
    materials are fed back into the production cycle (Graedel <i>et al</i>., 1995; 
    LTI-Research Group, 1998; Pauli, 1998). </li>
  <li>Products to services, that is shifting the entrepreneurial focus from the 
    sale of hardware to the direct sale of the services through leasing or renting 
    to facilitate the full utilization of hardware, including maintenance and 
    recycling (Deutscher Bundestag, 1995; Hennicke and Seifried, 1996; Hawken 
    <i>et al</i>., 1999).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#25","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' > 
    <small><sup>25</sup></small></a> </li>
  <li>Eco-efficient consumption, that is changing patterns of consumption (using 
    new technologies) to achieve greater efficiency and to reduce waste and pollution 
    (OECD, 1998) in sectors such as transport, food, and housing. Dematerializing 
    consumption may go hand-in-hand with a shift from resource-intensive goods 
    to service-intensive and knowledge-intensive goods (UNDP, 1998, p. 91).</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="1422"></a>1.4.2.2 Resource-light Infrastructures</h4>
<p>In a complementary strand of literature attention has focused on the greater 
  scope for a transition in developing countries by decoupling investment from 
  resource depletion and the destruction of ecological processes. More specifically, 
  since the physical infrastructure in developing countries is still being designed 
  and installed, they have a better opportunity to avoid the resource-intensive 
  trajectories of infrastructural evolution adopted by developed countries (Shukla 
  et al., 1998, p. 53; Goldemberg, 1998a). Specific examples cited in this context 
  are efficient rail systems, decentralized energy production, public transport, 
  grey-water sewage systems, surface irrigation systems, regionalized food systems, 
  and dense urban settlement clusters. These can set a country on the road towards 
  cleaner, less costly, more equitable, and less emission-intensive development 
  patterns. The costs of such a transition are probably higher in places where 
  considerable capital investments in infrastructures have already been made and 
  where turnover is rather slow. For this reason, the timing of such choices is 
  vital, as decisions about systemic technological solutions tend to lock economies 
  onto a path with a specific resource and emission intensity. </p>
<p>In the context of climate policies, innovations in energy systems are of particular 
  importance. Possible strategies advanced in the literature include a shift from 
  expanding conventional energy supply towards emphasizing energy services through 
  a combination of end-use efficiency, increased use of renewables, and new-generation 
  fossil-fuel technologies (Reddy et al., 1997, p. 131). Developing countries 
  that take advantage of these sorts of innovations could follow a path that leads 
  directly to less energy-intensive development patterns in the long run and thereby 
  avoid large increases in energy and/or GDP intensities in the short and medium 
  term. </p>

      <p><b>Box 1.4. The Brazilian Ethanol Programme </b></p>
      <p>In 1974, Brazil launched a programme to shift to sugarcane alcohol (ethanol) 
        as an automotive fuel, initially as an additive to gasoline in a proportion 
        of about 20%. After 1979, pure alcohol-fuelled cars were produced, with 
        the necessary technological adaptation of engines, through an agreement 
        between the government and multinational car companies in Brazil. The 
        conversion was driven primarily by tax policy and the regulation of fuel 
        and vehicles. The relative prices of alcohol and gasoline were adjusted 
        through Petrobras, the state owned oil company. In 1981 the price of alcohol 
        was set 26% below that of gasoline, although gasoline&#146;s production 
        cost was lower than that of alcohol (Pinguelli Rosa <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
      <p>The alcohol programme created more than 500,000 jobs in rural areas and 
        allowed Brazil to reduce oil imports. The sales of new alcohol-powered 
        cars grew to 30% in 1980 and to more than 90% of the total car sales after 
        1983 until 1987. Alcohol accounted for about 50% of car fuel consumption 
        at that time. However, the sharp decline in world oil prices along with 
        deregulation in the energy sector meant the abandonment of alcohol-fuelled 
        cars. Even in 1995, though, avoided emissions through alcohol fuel use 
        in Brazil were 24.3MtCO<sub>2</sub>. The cumulative avoided emissions 
        from 1975 to 1998 can be calculated as 385MtCO<sub>2</sub> (Pinguelli 
        Rosa and Ribiero, 1998).</p>

<a name="box14"></a> 
<p>In many places, renewable energy technologies seem to offer some of the best 
  prospects for providing needed energy services while addressing the multiple 
  challenges of sustainable development, including air pollution, mining, transport, 
  and energy security. For instance, 76% of Africa&#146;s population relies on 
  wood for its basic fuel needs; but research and policy design targetted to improve 
  sustainability has been largely absent. Solar energy has a significant potential 
  in sahelian Africa, but slow technological progress, high unit costs, and the 
  absence of technology transfer have retarded its installation. The Brazilian 
  ethanol programme to provide automotive fuel from renewable resources (see <a href="#box14">Box 
  1.4</a>) is another example. Throughout the developing world the exploitation 
  of hydro potential also remains constrained because of high capital requirements 
  and environmental and social concerns generated by inappropriate dam building. 
</p>
<h4><a name="1423"></a>1.4.2.3 &#147;Appropriate&#148; Technologies</h4>
<p>Development of so-called appropriate technologies could lead to environmental 
  protection and economic security in developing countries. The label &#147;appropriate 
  technologies&#148; is used because they build upon the indigenous knowledge 
  and capabilities of local communities; produce locally needed materials, use 
  natural resources in a sustainable fashion, and help to regenerate the natural 
  resource base. They may enable developing countries to keep an acceptable environmental 
  quality within a controlled cost (Hou, 1988). Low-cost, but resource-efficient 
  technologies are of particular importance for the rural and urban poor (see 
  <a href="#box15">Box 1.5</a>). There is a latent demand for low-cost housing, 
  small hydropower units, low-input organic agriculture, local non-grid power 
  stations, and biomass-based small industries. Sustainable agriculture can benefit 
  both the environment and food production. Biomass-based energy plants could 
  produce electricity from local waste materials in an efficient, low-cost, and 
  carbon-free manner. Each of these options needs to be evaluated alongside conventional 
  energy supply and demand alternatives (see <a href="089.htm">Chapter 3</a>) 
  in terms of the impacts and contribution to sustainable development. Expanding 
  the analysis of the set of available options in this way should make us better 
  off, as some of the new options will be attractive upon further analysis, although 
  others will not.</p>
<p>It is important, in light of these examples, to realize that the results of 
  greater resource efficiency differ according to the performance level of the 
  technology under consideration. Technologies devised for high eco-efficiency 
  and intermediate performance levels consume, for example, lower absolute amounts 
  of resources than comparable technologies designed for high eco-efficiency and 
  high performance levels. By design, performance levels can vary in such dimensions 
  as level of power, speed, availability of service, yield, and labour intensity. 
  Indeed, intermediate performance levels are often desirable because of their 
  higher employment impact, lower investment costs, local adaptability, and potential 
  for decentralization. For this reason, technologies that combine high eco-efficiency 
  with appropriate performance levels hold an enormous potential for improving 
  people&#146;s living conditions while containing the use of natural resources 
  and GHG emissions.</p>
<h4><a name="1424"></a>1.4.2.4 Full Cost Pricing</h4>
<p>Changing macroeconomic frameworks is often considered indispensable, in both 
  developed and developing countries (Stavins and Whitehead, 1997), to bringing 
  economic rationality progressively in line with ecological rationality. Economic 
  restructuring and energy-pricing reforms both compliment and are a prerequisite 
  for the success of many environmental policies (Bates et al., 1994; TERI, 1995). 
  As long as natural resources, including energy, are undervalued relative to 
  labour, the tendency should be to substitute the cheaper factor for the more 
  expensive one. Giving a boost to efficiency markets requires, first of all, 
  the elimination of environmentally counterproductive subsidies (at least over 
  the medium-to-long term), as on fossil fuels, motorized transport, or pesticides, 
  as much as concessions for logging and water extraction (Roodman, 1996; Larra&igrave;n 
  et al., 1999). Reform of environmentally destructive incentives would remove 
  a major source of price distortions. Finally, shifting the tax base gradually 
  from labour to natural resources in a revenue-neutral manner could begin to 
  rectify the imbalance in market prices (European Environment Agency, 1996; Hammond 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997). A more extensive discussion of eco-taxation, reporting 
  a wide-ranging debate, is given in <a href="224.htm">Chapter 6</a> of this report.<a name="box15"></a></p>

    <td class="box"><b>Box 1.5. Resource-efficient Construction in India </b> 
      <p>Recent analysis shows construction-sector activities to be major drivers 
        of Indian GHG emissions. In addition, conventional building costs place 
        traditional construction beyond the means of an increasing fraction of 
        rural families. A new building technology developed by an Indian non-profit 
        organization, Development Alternatives, reverses this trend. This technology 
        uses hand-powered rams to shape compressed earth into strong, durable, 
        weather-resistant but unbaked bricks. The ingredients for the bricks include 
        only locally available materials, mostly soil and water.</p>
      <p>Building new residential and commercial structures with these rammed-earth 
        bricks creates rural jobs and delivers structurally sound buildings with 
        high thermal integrity and few embodied emissions of GHGs. As a result 
        of their inherently high thermal mass, these new buildings easily incorporate 
        passive solar design for heating and cooling. Since they use little purchased 
        input besides human labour, their cost is well within the range of poor 
        families.</p>
