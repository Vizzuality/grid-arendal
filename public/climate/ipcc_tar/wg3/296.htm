<h3>7.4.2 Income and Other Macroeconomic Effects </h3>
<h4><a name="7421"></a>7.4.2.1 Macroeconomic Indicators</h4>
<p>Major programmes of mitigation or adaptation, particularly those that involve 
  the use of instruments such as energy and carbon taxes, cause changes in the 
  values of key macroeconomic variables. These include growth in GDP, employment, 
  external account balance, and the rate of inflation. As part of the decision-making 
  process, information on all these variables should be provided. Changes in GDP, 
  however, have a special role in the analysis. As noted in <a href="271.htm#722">Section 
  7.2.2</a>, under certain circumstances GDP is a valid welfare measure of the 
  value of the goods and services produced in an economy. In so far as this is 
  the case, changes in GDP in real terms (i.e., adjusting for price changes) are 
  also a valid measure of the costs of any mitigation policy. The major qualification 
  is that prices should reflect social costs and that all activities that affect 
  welfare should be included. To the extent that this is not the case a change 
  in GDP is not an accurate measure of the costs of a programme. One common reason 
  for divergence between GDP and welfare is the presence of external effects. 
  Another is the failure to account for the economic value of leisure or household 
  work. The macroeconomic models referred to in <a href="309.htm">Section 7.6</a>, 
  and analyzed in detail in <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a>, do not report 
  the costs of market-based programmes for GHG reduction at the microeconomic 
  level, but do so in terms of conventional GDP.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#14","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>14</sup></small></a> 
</p>
<p>It must be recognized that the full set of adjustments to GDP measures needed 
  to obtain a correct welfare measure of the costs is difficult to compute. If 
  the policies have ancillary benefits and/or co-benefits, then the overall costs 
  of the measures are less than any fall in GDP. This adjustment can be made (using 
  the methods discussed in <a href="277.htm">Section 7.2.3</a>) to the GDP measure 
  if the data on the ancillary benefits are collected. Other adjustments relate 
  to changes in distributional effects and the shadow pricing of goods and services 
  for which prices do not reflect social costs. Without a detailed microlevel 
  analysis of which sectors are affected, however, these corrections are not possible. 
  Hence it has to be recognized that GDP changes are less accurate as measures 
  of the true costs of mitigation programmes, and that the use of multi-attribute 
  and other similar analyses is even more important for the assessment of such 
  programmes.</p>
<p>Several authors suggest the inclusion of more comprehensive welfare measures 
  in macroeconomic studies to give a better reflection of social costs. The United 
  Nations Commission for Sustainable Development (UNCSD) has developed a system 
  for Green GDP accounting and a list of sustainable development indicators that 
  can be used to include part of the social cost aspects in GDP measures (UNCSD, 
  1999). The indicators cover social, economic, environmental, and institutional 
  DES aspects. A study by H&aring;konsen and Mathiesen (1997), based on a CGE 
  model, assessed large differences in welfare implications of three mitigation 
  policy cases, namely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>case A, in which carbon tax revenue is recycled lump-sum to the household;<br>
  </li>
  <li>case B, in which carbon tax revenue substitutes labour taxes; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>case C, in which the model includes ancillary benefits related to local 
    air pollution and the transport sector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sen (1999) presents a broader perspective on economic development and emphasizes 
  that economic welfare is not the primary goal of development, but is rather 
  an instrument to achieve the primary goal to enhance human freedom. Freedom, 
  at the same time, is instrumental in achieving development. The studies should 
  consider a broad range of development issues including impacts on economic opportunities, 
  political freedoms, social facilities, transparency guarantees, and protective 
  security. </p>
