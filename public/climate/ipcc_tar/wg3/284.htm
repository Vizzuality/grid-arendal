<h3>7.3.2 Importance of Baselines </h3>
<h4><a name="7321"></a>7.3.2.1 Development Patterns and Baseline Scenario Alternatives</h4>
<p>The baseline case, which by definition gives the emissions of GHGs in the absence 
  of the climate change interventions being considered, is critical to the assessment 
  of the costs of climate change mitigation. This is because the definition of 
  the baseline scenario determines the potential for future GHG emissions reduction, 
  as well as the costs of implementing these reduction policies. The baseline 
  scenario also has a number of important implicit assumptions about future economic 
  policies at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels, including sectoral structure, 
  resource intensity, prices and thereby technology choice. </p>
<p>Macroeconomic issues that are particularly relevant to developing countries 
  (such as instability of output, constrained capital, and foreign exchange) similarly 
  have important implications on GHG emissions through impacts on energy sector 
  investments and energy-intensive production sectors. These assumptions have 
  important implications for the efficiency of policy instruments applied to climate 
  change mitigation strategies and thereby for implementation costs, which are 
  discussed in <a href="277.htm">Section 7.2.3</a>. </p>
<p>Economic policies have a number of direct and indirect impacts on GHG emitting 
  sectors. It is generally expected that successful economic policies generate 
  increased growth and the emissions intensity of the economy then depends on 
  the mix of products produced as well as on the efficiency with which they are 
  produced. Economic policies in some cases can imply a more efficient use of 
  resources, which means that the GHG emission intensity per unit of economic 
  output decreases. The tendency to increase GHG emissions alongside economic 
  growth is expected to be particularly &#147;strong&#148; in countries that presently 
  have low energy consumption. The challenge is to pursue a development pattern 
  in which economic development is achieved alongside relatively low GHG emissions 
  and other environmental impacts. </p>
<p>Many macroeconomic and sectoral policies have important consequences for future 
  GHG emissions through the impacts on sectoral structure, resource intensity, 
  prices, and thereby technology choice. Macroeconomic issues like constrained 
  capital and foreign exchange can lead to low investments in the energy sector, 
  to major energy-intensive production sectors, or to the high utilization of 
  pollution-intensive domestic fuels. In the same way, uncertainty or macroeconomic 
  instability has a tendency to slow down investments because of the risk perceptions 
  of foreign and national investors, and because of high interest rates.</p>
<p>As noted, GHG emissions are interlinked with general economic development patterns 
  and economic policies. These policies have an influence both on the baseline 
  as well as on the effectiveness of the mitigation options, and thereby on GHG 
  emission levels. It is useful to &#147;decompose&#148; the GHG emission/GDP 
  intensity factor into subcomponents that explain the implicit resource components 
  behind the GHG emissions. One way to achieve this for the energy sector is based 
  on the so-called Kaya identity (Kaya, 1989):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/equ7-1.gif"></p>
<p>The first component of the identity, GHG emissions per energy unit, reflects 
  the GHG emission intensity of energy consumption, which again reflects natural 
  resource endowment and relative prices of the different energy sources. The 
  second factor (energy consumption per GDP unit) reflects both the weight of 
  energy-intensive processes in GDP and the efficiency of the resources used. 
  The same approach can be used to assess GHG emission intensities of other sectors, 
  such as agriculture, forestry, waste management, and industry. </p>
<p>Development may follow different paths in countries according to socioeconomic 
  conditions, resources, national policies and priorities, and institutional issues. 
  For instance, a rapidly growing economy develops a different composition of 
  capital stock and energy use pattern compared with a slowly growing country. 
  A nation following development policies that emphasize greater investments in 
  infrastructure, such as efficient rail transport, renewable energy technologies, 
  and energy efficiency improvements, exhibits a low GHG emission trajectory. 
  However, a nation with substantial coal resources, scarce capital, and a low 
  level of trade can be pushed towards a development path with high emissions.</p>
