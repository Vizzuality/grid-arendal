<h3>6.5.3 The Effects of Alternative Policy Instruments on Technological Change 
</h3>
<p>In the long run, the development and widespread adoption of new technologies 
  can greatly ameliorate what, in the short run, sometimes appear to be overwhelming 
  conflicts between economic well being and environmental quality. Therefore, 
  the effect of public policies on the development and spread of new technologies 
  may be among the most important determinants of success or failure in environmental 
  protection (Kneese and Schultze, 1975).</p>
<p>To achieve widespread benefits from a new technology, three steps are required 
  (Schumpeter, 1942):</p>
<ul>
  <li>invention, the development of a new technical idea;<br>
  </li>
  <li>innovation, the incorporation of a new idea into a commercial product or 
    process and the first marketplace implementation thereof; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>diffusion, the typically gradual process by which improved products or processes 
    become widely used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rates of invention, innovation, and technology diffusion are affected by opportunities 
  that exist for firms and individuals to profit from investing in research, in 
  commercial development, and in marketing and product development (Stoneman, 
  1983).</p>
<p>Governments often seek to influence each of these directly, by investment in 
  public research, subsidies to research and technological development, dissemination 
  of information, and other means (Mowery and Rosenberg, 1989). Policies with 
  large economic impacts, such as those intended to address global climate change, 
  can be designed to foster technological invention, innovation, and diffusion 
  (Kemp and Soete, 1990). For the impact of R&amp;D policies on technology development 
  and transfer, see the IPCC Special Report on Technology Transfer (IPCC, 2000).</p>
<p>To examine the link between policy instruments and technological change, environmental 
  policies can be characterized as market-based approaches, performance standards, 
  technology standards, and voluntary agreements. All these forms of intervention 
  have the potential to induce or force some amount of technological change, because 
  by their very nature they induce or require firms to do things they would not 
  otherwise do. Performance and technology standards can be explicitly designed 
  to be &#147;technology forcing&#148;, mandating performance levels that are 
  not currently viewed as technologically feasible or mandating technologies that 
  are not fully developed. The problem with this approach can be that while regulators 
  typically assume that some amount of improvement over existing technology will 
  always be feasible, it is impossible to know how much. Standards must either 
  be made not very ambitious, or else run the risk of being ultimately unachievable, 
  which leads to great political and economic disruption (Freeman and Haveman, 
  1972). However, in the case of obstructed technology, regulators know quite 
  well the technology improvements that are feasible. Thus, although the problem 
  of standards being either too low or too ambitious remains a possibility, it 
  does not make standards inherently incapable of implementing some portion of 
  the available technology base, and to do so cost-effectively on the basis of 
  cost&#150;benefit tests.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#106","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>106</sup></small></a></p>
