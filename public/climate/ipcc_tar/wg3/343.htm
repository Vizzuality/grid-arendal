<h3>8.3.2 Spillover Effects: Economic Effects of Measures in Countries on Other 
  Countries </h3>
<p>In a world in which economies are linked by international trade and capital 
  flows, abatement by one economy induces spillover effects and has welfare impacts 
  on other economies. It matters to understand the conditions under which both 
  abating and non-abating economies will experience positive or negative impacts 
  from the policy adopted in other groups of countries; it matters also to understand 
  the results of these spillover effects in terms of carbon leakage. <a href="266.htm">Chapter 
  7</a> provides the basic concepts of such an analysis and here some brief comments 
  are added to explain the strengths and weaknesses on the results found by modelling 
  exercises. </p>
<p>In static terms, without international capital mobility, the welfare costs 
  of abatement for an open economy can be decomposed into two components (Dixit 
  and Norman, 1984):<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>costs that would be incurred if the economy were closed; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>changes in the terms of trade, which are the first transmission mechanism 
    for spillover effects (see <a href="266.htm">Chapter 7</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If they require to go beyond &#147;no regrets&#148; potentials, binding emissions 
  constraint comes to increasing the cost of carbon-intensive products and, if 
  emissions arise from the production of its export goods, the abating economy 
  benefits from better terms of trade. If, indeed, the importing economy cannot 
  produce a perfect substitute easily, it will sell the same product at a higher 
  price and increase its purchasing power of imported goods. The non-abating economy 
  will symmetrically suffer a welfare loss because of more expensive imports, 
  while the net result for the abating economy depends on the size of improvement 
  in the terms of trade relative to the production costs of abatement. The welfare 
  impacts are more important in the economies that are very dependent on foreign 
  trade.<br>
</p>
<p>In the real world, an emission constraint simultaneously affects both export 
  and import goods, but this does change the nature of the mechanism. Increased 
  production of emission-intensive goods in non-Annex I regions is stimulated 
  by both increased non-Annex I consumption and increased exports to Annex I regions. 
  The net relative balance between these parameters is influenced by the extent 
  to which Annex I emission constraints fall on export competing industries (when 
  the country is specialized in such industries) as opposed to import-competing 
  industries (when it imports carbon intensive goods). If a constraint predominantly 
  affects export industries, it encourages increased non-Annex I production for 
  internal consumption. If the constraint predominantly affects import-competing 
  industries, increased non-Annex I production is mainly exported to Annex I regions. 
  Emissions leakage is beneficial to non-Annex I economies only in the second 
  case, since it is associated with an improvement in their terms of trade, whereas 
  their terms of trade deteriorate in the first case. </p>
<p>Another factor that affects the increase of emission-intensive goods in non-Annex 
  I regions is the effect of Annex I abatement on the intermediate demand for 
  fossil fuels. As discussed above, Annex I abatement will reduce fossil fuel 
  prices. Lower prices for fossil fuels will encourage the production of more 
  emission-intensive goods and the use of more emission-intensive production techniques 
  in non-Annex I regions<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#15","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup> 
  15</sup></small></a>.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#15","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small></small></a></p>
<p>So far, it was assumed that changes in the production structures in both Annex 
  I and Non-Annex I countries result only in changes in final demand and in price 
  structures. The introduction of international capital mobility complicates the 
  analysis since, in addition to production costs and changes in the terms of 
  trade, carbon constraints alter the relative rates of return in the abating 
  and non-abating countries. If capital flows from the first country to the second 
  in response to these changes, there will be a further restriction of the production 
  frontier (the set of possible productive combinations) for the abating economy 
  and an outward shift for the other economy. Factor rewards in both countries 
  are also affected. Part of the income from foreign investment accrues to the 
  home economy and subtracts from income in the foreign economy; abating economies 
  are affected by changes in income and factor prices that result from changes 
  in international capital flows, with symmetric gains for non-abating economies.</p>
<p>No theoretical results for complex and empirically relevant cases can be obtained 
  as to the extent that international capital mobility modifies the conclusions 
  of the static analysis of the role of the trade effects. However, modelling 
  results are seldom reported on the welfare impact of changes in international 
  capital flows, although McKibbin <i>et al. </i>(1999) emphasize the macroeconomic 
  repercussions. It is still, indeed, impossible to derive clear conclusions about 
  the role of these changes, because of the methodological difficulties in interpreting 
  the results from complex CGE models. It is usually conceded that modelling international 
  capital flows is one of the more contentious issues; technically indeed, such 
  a modelling relies on equalizing rates of return on capital across countries, 
  but, because this makes capital flows too reactive, various &#147;ad hoc&#148; 
  devices are used to obtain less irrealistic outcomes. Differences in the riskiness 
  of rates of returns are clearly relevant to explain most of the real behaviours, 
  but how this can be &#147;best&#148; dealt with in a deterministic model is 
  an open question. Progress depends on the further development of techniques<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#16","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>16</sup></small></a>.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#16","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small></small></a> 
  It depends also on progress in theoretical and empirical analyses to capture 
  more effectively how the exchange rate of currencies reacts to external payment 
  deficits. This depends on the level of confidence on the future economic expansion 
  of each country and how monetary policies (including the determination of the 
  public discount rate) employed to mitigate adverse impacts can change the return 
  to capital in a country relative to other countries.</p>
<p>Models reviewed in this section have in common features that must be clearly 
  borne in mind when interpreting the results:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>They assume perfect competition in all industries.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Most of them use the so-called Armington specification that identical goods 
    produced in different countries are imperfect substitutes: it is known that 
    the results may then be sensitive to the particular commodity and chosen regional 
    aggregation models (Lloyd, 1994).<br>
  </li>
  <li>All of the models, apart from the G-cubed model of McKibbin and Wilcoxen 
    (1995), are long-term growth models with international trade, without explicitly 
    modelled financial markets that affect the macroeconomic adjustment<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#17","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>17</sup></small></a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Emission reductions involve only carbon dioxide<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#18","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>18</sup></small></a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The bias in technological change is unaffected by the emissions constraints 
    and the production possibilities frontier always lies below the unconstrained 
    frontier. Under such a hypothesis, the aggregate impact is unlikely to be 
    positive, but some economies may benefit from favourable changes in their 
    terms of trade and from changes in international capital flows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simulation studies covered in this report were conducted prior to and after 
  the negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol. Pre-Kyoto studies consider more stringent 
  emissions reduction targets for Annex I regions than the average 5.2% actually 
  adopted under the Protocol. The major findings are that Annex B abatement would 
  result in welfare losses for most non-Annex I regions under the more stringent 
  targets. The magnitude of these losses is reduced under the less stringent Kyoto 
  targets. Some non-Annex I regions that would experience a welfare loss under 
  the more stringent targets experience a mild welfare gain under the less stringent 
  targets.</p>
<p>Studies using a variety of more stringent pre-Kyoto targets include Coppel 
  and Lee (1995; the GREEN model), Jacoby <i>et al. </i>(1997; the EPPA model), 
  Brown <i>et al.</i>1997b) and Donovan <i>et al </i>(1997; the GTEM model), and 
  Harrison and Rutherford (1999; the IIAM model). The last two models are based 
  on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database (Hertel, 1997).</p>
<p>In these studies, most non-Annex I countries suffer deterioration in their 
  terms of trade and also welfare losses. Since the analysis at the region or 
  country level depends on the type of aggregation, it is difficult to give a 
  comprehensive list of exceptions. The reasons for these exceptions are, however, 
  easy to explain. Brazil and South Korea are, in many models, found to enjoy 
  welfare gains from Annex I abatement policies because, unlike other non-Annex 
  I regions, they are net importers of fossil fuels and have a high relative dependence 
  on exports of iron and steel and non-ferrous metal products. In addition, in 
  Brazil these products are far less intensive in fossil energy than in many other 
  economies<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#19","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>19</sup></small></a>.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#19","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small></small></a> 
  Brazil gains from lower prices for fossil fuel imports and higher prices for 
  exports of iron and steel and non-ferrous metal products. Conversely, non-Annex 
  I regions with the greatest dependence on fossil fuel exports, such as the Middle 
  East and Indonesia, suffer the greatest deterioration. Non-Annex I regions that 
  are net importers of manufacture goods that are fossil-fuel intensive also suffer 
  a deterioration even if they benefit from lower oil prices.</p>
<p>One of the most important conclusions is that a number of those among non-Annex 
  I regions that experienced a welfare loss under the pre-Kyoto targets experience 
  a welfare gain under the Kyoto targets. For example, in the GREEN model, India 
  and the Dynamic Asian Economies experienced a loss in real income in the pre-Kyoto 
  simulation (Coppel and Lee, 1995). They experience a mild gain in real income 
  under simulations of the Kyoto Protocol that involve varying degrees of policy 
  co-ordination among the non-Annex I regions (van der Mensbrugghe, 1998). In 
  pre-Kyoto simulations of the GTEM model (Brown <i>et al., </i>1997b; Donovan<i> 
  et al.,</i> 1997), Chinese Taipei, India, Brazil, and the Rest of America were 
  all found to experience welfare losses; with Kyoto targets (Tulpul&eacute; <i>et 
  al.,</i> 1999) these regions experience mild welfare gains.</p>
<p>There is one key reason why some regions that experienced welfare losses under 
  the more stringent targets experience mild gains in welfare under the Kyoto 
  targets: the changing balance between substitution and output reduction with 
  the level of abatement. GDP losses or the required level of a carbon tax for 
  Annex I regions are, indeed, an increasing function of the level of abatement 
  and the milder Kyoto targets are expected to be achieved with a greater reliance 
  on substitution relative to output reduction than the more stringent targets.</p>
<p>A fairly similar regional pattern of non-Annex I welfare changes is found in 
  simulations of Kyoto targets in a number of studies in which comparable pre-Kyoto 
  target simulations are not available. These studies include Kainuma <i>et al.</i> 
  (1999; the AIM model drawing on the GTAP database), McKibbin <i>et al.</i> (1999; 
  the G-Cubed model), Bernstein <i>et al.</i> 1999; MS-MRT, drawing on the GTAP 
  database), and Brown <i>et al.,</i> (1999; the multigas (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, 
  and NO<sub>x</sub>) version of GTEM) and B&ouml;hringer and Rutherford (2001).</p>
