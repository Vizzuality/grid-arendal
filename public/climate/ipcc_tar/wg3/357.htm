<h4>9.2.1.2 Reducing Subsidies in the Energy Sector</h4>
<p>Empirical and theoretical studies indicate that no regrets policies can result 
  from the removal of subsidies from fossil fuels or from electricity that relies 
  on fossil fuels. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC article 
  4.2e (ii)) calls for Annex I Parties &#147;to identify and periodically review 
  its own policies and practices which encourage ... [greater emissions] than 
  would otherwise occur&#148;. The Kyoto Protocol calls for such Parties to &#147;implement 
  &#133; measures ... such as ... progressive reduction or phasing out of market 
  imperfections, fiscal incentives, tax and duty exemptions and subsidies in all 
  greenhouse gas emitting sectors that run counter to the objective of the Convention 
  &#133;&#148;.</p>
<p>The extent of the impact of reducing subsidies will depend on the specific 
  characteristic of each country, the type of subsidy involved, and the international 
  co-ordination to implement similar measures. Most countries introduce subsidies 
  in order to accomplish several policy objectives. In the case of energy, these 
  are usually in order to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>secure domestic energy supplies;</li>
  <li>ensure that power supply is sufficient to meet demand;</li>
  <li>provide access to energy for low-income households;</li>
  <li>maintain or slow the loss of employment in mining communities; and</li>
  <li>retain the international competitiveness of domestic industry. </li>
</ul>
<p>Coal subsidies have encouraged high production of coal in a number of industrial 
  countries and high coal consumption in numerous developing and transition economies 
  (OECD, 1997c). For example, a complete measure of the total support to producers 
  can be estimated in the form of the producer subsidy equivalent (PSE), which 
  has been calculated annually by the International Energy Agency (IEA) for several 
  countries since 1988 ( IEA, 1998b). DRI (1994) used revised versions of the 
  IEA&#146;s coal PSE estimates (shown in <a href="#tab92">Table 9.2</a>) to model 
  the effects of removing subsidies. These subsidies tend to increase GHG emissions 
  and more general pollution.</p>

<p>In recent years many countries have changed their energy policy, from a focus 
  on energy self-sufficiency, to broader policy objectives, oriented towards encouraging 
  economic efficiency and taking into account environmental problems. Subsidies 
  are currently under review by many countries, and in some cases reforms have 
  already taken place. Nevertheless, large subsidies remain in both Annex I and 
  non-Annex I countries.</p>
<p>In theoretical terms, polluting activities, such as coal mining and coal burning, 
  could be taxed in order to achieve economic efficiency. Economic theory indicates 
  that the optimal policy would be to replace those production and consumption 
  subsidies with optimal taxes. According to global studies, even without adding 
  new taxes, removing the subsidies and trade barriers at a sectoral level would 
  create a win-win situation, improving efficiency and reducing the environmental 
  damage (Burniaux <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1992; Hoeller and Coppel, 1992; Larson 
  and Shah, 1992, 1995; Anderson and McKibbin, 1997). It is a well-established 
  finding that removal of these subsidies would result in substantial reductions 
  in GHG emissions, as well as stimulating economic growth. Local studies also 
  indicate that removing support to the production and use of coal and other fossil 
  fuels can result in substantial reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the 
  main coal-using countries, at the same time as reducing the cost of electricity 
  production (DRI, 1994; Shelby <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1994; Golub and Gurvich, 
  1996; Michaelis, 1996; OECD, 1997c, Appendix A). <a href="358.htm#tab93">Table 
  9.3</a> is a review of the quantitative results of these case studies, along 
  with the global studies. Note, however, that these analyses adopt different 
  methodologies, so that the figures are not directly comparable.</p>
<p>In spite of these results, it is not wise to generalize about the environmental 
  and economic effects of removing subsidies in the energy industry (OECD, 1997c). 
  For example, the effect of removing subsidies to coal producers depends heavily 
  on the type of subsidy removed and the availability and economics of alternative 
  energy sources, including imported coal. Removing some electricity sector subsidies 
  may have very little effect on GHG emissions or may even increase emissions, 
  for example, when subsidies to electricity supply industry investment are supporting 
  the use of less polluting energy sources. Finally, there may be cases where 
  removing a subsidy to an energy-intensive industry in one country would lead 
  to a shift in production to other countries with lower costs or environmental 
  standards, resulting in a net increase in global GHG emissions (OECD, 1997c). 
  The issue of carbon leakage is addressed in greater detail in <a href="319.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="9213"></a>9.2.1.3 Sectoral Impacts of the Kyoto Mechanisms</h4>
<p>The effects of the Kyoto Mechanisms at the sectoral level are complex. The 
  available studies have looked at the effect of international emissions trading, 
  but there have been no comprehensive studies on the sectoral effects of the 
  Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) or joint implementation (JI). Countries buying 
  assigned amount units (AAUs), or funding CDM and JI projects, may have less 
  need to reduce fossil fuel consumption. Therefore, the sectors in these countries 
  that depend on fossil fuel production or use may experience smaller economic 
  impacts (Brown <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1999). This would also reduce the impact 
  on fossil fuel producers, both at the domestic and international level. However, 
  countries selling credits, or hosting JI and CDM projects, will have to generate 
  these AAUs or Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) through either reduction 
  of GHG emissions or enhancement of sinks. The economic impact on sectors within 
  those countries will vary depending on the source of the credits. Some sectors 
  will benefit, while others may see reduced rates of growth. Until the rules 
  for implementation of the Kyoto mechanisms have been decided, sectoral impacts 
  of their use will remain speculative. <br>
