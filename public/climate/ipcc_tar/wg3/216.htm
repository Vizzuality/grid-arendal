<h3>5.4.6 Forestry </h3>
<p>In addition to the several generic barriers that are discussed in <a href="185.htm">Section 
  5.3</a>, the forestry sector faces land use regulation and other macroeconomic 
  policies that usually favour conversion to other land uses such as agriculture, 
  cattle ranching, and urban industry. Insecure land tenure regimes, and tenure 
  rights and subsidies favouring agriculture or livestock are among the most important 
  barriers for ensuring sustainable management of forests as well as sustainability 
  of carbon (C) abatement. </p>
<p>The Special Report on Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000a) 
  notes significant opportunities for forestry and other land-use change activities 
  to sequester carbon. Afforestation and reforestation activities could capture 
  between 197 to 584MtC/yr in all countries under the IPCC &#147;definitional&#148; 
  scenario between 2008 to 2012. The estimated deforestation, however, would negate 
  this sequestration potential. Halting deforestation offers additional opportunity 
  to reduce emissions. Forest management and agroforestry options offer a potential 
  to capture another 700MtC/yr by 2010. Capturing these opportunities, however, 
  entails significant hurdles of the types noted below.</p>
<p><i>Lack of Technical Capability</i><br>
  In many developing countries, the national and state forest departments play 
  a predominant role in all aspects of forest protection, regeneration, and management. 
  Currently lack of funding and technical capabilities in most tropical countries 
  limit generation of information required for planning and implementation of 
  forestry mitigation projects. Apart from a few exceptions, developing countries 
  do not have adequate capacity to participate in international research projects 
  and to adapt and transfer results of the research to the local level. Research 
  on forests has not only suffered from a lack of resources; it has not been sufficiently 
  interdisciplinary to provide an integrated view of forestry (FAO, 1997). However, 
  the majority of the forestry research institutions do not function as R&amp;D 
  laboratories as they do in industry, and the main focus is on research and not 
  technology development and dissemination. Unlike in the energy or transportation 
  sectors, the technologies or even the management systems are going to be forest 
  type or country specific.</p>
<p><i>Lack of Capacity for Monitoring Carbon Stocks </i><br>
  Forestry-sector GHG mitigation activities and joint implementation projects 
  generally face a wide range of technical issues that challenge their credibility. 
  The twin objectives of using forestry to mitigate climate change and managing 
  forests sustainably do pose a challenge in monitoring and verifying benefits 
  from carbon offset projects in the sector (Andrasko, 1997). While methods generally 
  exist to monitor carbon stocks in vegetation, soils and products, operational 
  systems that could be readily implemented for this purpose are lacking in all 
  countries (IPCC, 2000a). Monitoring and verification are key elements in gaining 
  the credibility needed to capture the potential benefits of forestry sector 
  response options, particularly in reducing deforestation (Fearnside, 1997). 
  While this is a generic barrier to deforestation reduction initiatives, it also 
  represents an opportunity for transferring the technologies needed to monitor 
  land-use change and carbon stocks and flows. Among the mitigation options, there 
  is a higher degree of certainty on reforestation and/or afforestation, less 
  on forest management, and even less on forest conservation. </p>
<p>Under the GEF-UNDP sponsored Asian Least-Cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategy 
  (ALGAS), the US Country Studies Program (Sathaye <i>et al</i>., 1997a), and other forestry 
  sector capacity building and analytical activities have identified mitigation 
  options and technologies. Furthermore, the policies to promote technology transfer 
  have been identified (e.g., regulations, financial incentives) and sometimes 
  implemented (e.g., Mexico, Bolivia). Under the UNFCCC, each party is required 
  to communicate a national inventory of GHG emissions by sources and sinks. A 
  large portion of the parties has completed this task and is trying to understand 
  forestry sector emissions and removals by sinks, which has improved dramatically. 
  Many parties are taking steps to manage forest systems as C reservoirs (Kokorin, 
  1997; Sathaye <i>et al</i>., 1997a).</p>
<p>As a result of the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, many developing and transitional 
  countries are developing National Climate Change Action Plans (NCCAPs) which 
  incorporate forestry-sector mitigation and adaptation options (Benioff <i>et al</i>., 
  1997). &#145;&#145;No regrets&#146;&#146; adaptation and mitigation options 
  have been identified that are consistent with national sustainable development 
  goals. Bulgaria, China, Hungary, Russia, Ukraine, Mexico, Nigeria, and Venezuela 
  all have developed very specific forestry sector climate action plans.</p>
<p>The Russian Federation has a progressive forestry sector climate change action 
  plan (Kokorin, 1997), although its implementation is uncertain under the current 
  economic conditions. Based on current economic and climate change scenarios 
  several mitigation and adaptation scenarios have emerged: (1) creating economic 
  mechanisms to increase forestry sector effectiveness and efficiency in logged 
  (removal) areas, (2) providing assistance for forestation in the Europe-Ural 
  region, (3) promoting fire management and protection for central and northeastern 
  Siberia, and (4) limiting clear-cut logging in southern Siberia. These steps 
  are significant since Russia contains approximately 22% of the world&#146;s 
  coniferous forests.</p>
<p>Forestry mitigation projects are likely to be largely funded by Annex I countries 
  and implemented in non-Annex I countries and EITs. Technology, including management 
  systems, is an integral part of all projects funded by bilateral or multilateral 
  or commercial agencies. Thus, promotion of mitigation projects also automatically 
  promotes the flow of technology from donor agencies or countries to host countries 
  or agencies. In fact, technology transfer is already happening. Forestry sector 
  options are of relatively low cost compared to those in the energy sector (Sathaye 
  and Ravindranath, 1998). But there are some problems and uncertainties regarding 
  the incremental C abated: its sustainability, measurement, verification, and 
  certification. All forestry sector GHG mitigation projects must ensure that 
  they meet accepted standards for sustainable forest management (Sathaye <i>et al</i>., 
  1997b). Independent verification of C abatement would help to increase the credibility 
  and funding of forestry-sector mitigation projects.<br>
