<h4>3.5.4.4 HFC-23 Emissions from HCFC-22 Production</h4>
<p>HFC-23 is generated as a by-product during the manufacture of HCFC-22 and emitted 
  through the plant condenser vent. There are about 20 HCFC-22 plants globally. 
  Additional new plants are expected in developing countries as CFC production 
  plants are converted to comply with the Montreal Protocol and demand for refrigeration 
  grows. Although HCFC-22 is an ozone-depleting chemical and production for commercial 
  use will be phased out between 2005 and 2040, production as a feedstock chemical 
  for synthetic polymers will continue.</p>
<p>Technologies available to reduce emissions of HFC-23 have been reviewed by 
  the Research Triangle Institute (RTI, 1996; Rand <i>et al</i>., 1999) and March Consulting 
  Group (March Consulting, 1998). Two emission reduction options were identified. 
<ul>
  <li> Optimization of the HCFC-22 production process to minimize HFC-23 emissions. 
    This technology is readily transferable to developing countries. Process optimization 
    is relatively inexpensive and is demonstrated to reduce emissions of fully 
    optimized plants to below 2% of HCFC-22 production. Nearly all plants in developed 
    countries have optimized systems. <br>
  <li> Thermal destruction technologies are available today and can achieve emissions 
    reductions of as high as 99%, although actual reductions will be determined 
    by the fraction of production time that the destruction device is actually 
    operating. Cost estimates are 7 ECU/tC for the EU (March Consulting, 1998, 
    8% discount rate). 
</ul>

<h4>3.5.4.5 Emissions of SF<sub>6</sub> from the Production, Use and Decommissioning 
  of Gas Insulated Switchgear</h4>
<p>SF<sub>6</sub> is used for electrical insulation, arc quenching, and current 
  interruption in electrical equipment used in the transmission and distribution 
  of high-voltage electricity. SF<sub>6</sub> has physical properties that make 
  it ideal for use in high-voltage electric power equipment, including high dielectric 
  strength, excellent arc quenching properties, low chemical reactivity, and good 
  heat transfer characteristics. The high dielectric strength of SF<sub>6</sub> 
  allows SF<sub>6</sub>-insulated equipment to be more compact than equivalent 
  air-insulated equipment. An SF<sub>6</sub>-insulated substation can require 
  as little as 10% of the volume of an air-insulated substation. Most of the SF<sub>6</sub> 
  used in electrical equipment is used in gas-insulated switch gear and circuit 
  breakers. SF<sub>6</sub> in electric equipment is the largest use category of 
  SF<sub>6</sub> with global estimates of over 75% of SF<sub>6</sub> sales going 
  to electric power applications (SPS, 1997). Options to reduce emissions include 
  upgrading equipment with low emission technology, and improved handling during 
  installation maintenance and/decommissioning (end-of-life) of SF<sub>6</sub>-insulated 
  equipment, which includes the avoidance of deliberate release and systematic 
  recycling. Guidelines on equipment design to allow ease of gas recycling, appropriate 
  gas handling and recycling procedures, features of gas handling and recycling 
  equipment, and the impact of voluntary emission reduction programmes are contributing 
  to the reduction of emissions from this sector (Mauthe <i>et al</i>, 1997; Causey, 
  2000).</p>
<p>Significant emissions may also occur during the manufacturing and testing of 
  gas-insulated switch gear when the systems are repeatedly filled with SF<sub>6</sub> 
  and re-evacuated (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000). Historically these emissions 
  have been in the range of 30%-50% of the total charge of SF<sub>6</sub>. The 
  existence and appropriate use of state-of-the art recovery equipment can help 
  to reduce these emissions down to at least 10% of the total charge of SF<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<h4>3.5.4.6 Emissions of SF<sub>6</sub> from Magnesium Production and Casting</h4>
<p>In the magnesium industry, a dilute mixture of SF<sub>6</sub> with dry air 
  and/or CO<sub>2</sub> is used as a protective cover gas to prevent violent oxidation 
  of the molten metal. It is assumed that all SF<sub>6</sub> used is emitted to 
  the atmosphere. 7% of global SF<sub>6</sub> sales is estimated to be for magnesium 
  applications (SPS, 1997). Manufacturing segments include primary magnesium production, 
  die casting, gravity casting and secondary production (<i>i.e.</i>, scrap metal recycling). 
  Because of differing production processes and plant scale, emission reduction 
  potential varies across manufacturing segments. Emissions of SF<sub>6</sub> 
  in magnesium casting can potentially be reduced to zero by switching to SO, 
  a highly toxic and corrosive chemical used over20 years ago as a protective 
  cover gas. Harnisch and Hendriks (2000) estimate that net costs of switching 
  from SF<sub>6</sub> to SO<sub>2</sub>-based cover gas systems are about US$1/tC<sub>eq</sub>, 
  but as a result of the high toxicity and corrosivity of SO<sub>2</sub> much 
  more careful handling and gas management is required. In many cases the specific 
  usage of SF<sub>6</sub> can be reduced by operational changes, including moderate 
  technical modifications (Maiss and Brenninkmeijer, 1998). Companies may also 
  reduce SF<sub>6</sub> emissions and save money by carefully managing the concentration 
  and application of the cover gas (IMA, 1998). A study is currently beingundertaken 
  to identify and evaluate chemical alternatives to SF<sub>6</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> 
  for magnesium melt protection (Clow and Hillls, 2000).</p>
<a name="3547"></a> 
<h4>3.5.4.7 Some Smaller Non-CO<sub>2</sub> Emission Reduction Options</h4>
<p>There are a number of small emission sources of SF<sub>6</sub>, some of which 
  are considered technically unnecessary. For example, SF<sub>6</sub> has been 
  used as a substitute for air, hydrogen or nitrogen in sport shoes and luxury 
  car tyres to extend the lifetime of the pressurized system. SF<sub>6</sub> in 
  sport shoes has been used by a large global manufacturer for over a decade under 
  a patented process. Soundproof windows have been manufactured with SF<sub>6</sub> 
  in several countries in Europe.</p>
<p>Small quantities of SF<sub>6</sub> are used as a dielectric in the guidance 
  system of radar systems like the airborne warning and control system (AWACS) 
  aircraft and as a tracer gas for pollutant dispersion studies. Small quantities 
  of PFCs and SF<sub>6</sub> are used in medical applications such as retina repair, 
  collapsed lung expansion, and blood substitution (UNEP, 1999).</p>

<h4>3.5.4.8 Summary of Manufacturing Industry GHG Emission Reduction Options </h4>
<p>An overview of greenhouse gas emission reduction options in manufacturing industry 
  due to fuel switching, carbon dioxide removal, material efficiency improvements, 
  and reduction of non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases emissions practices is 
  presented in <a href="#tab321">Table 3.21</a>, which complements information 
  from <a href="108.htm#tab319">Table 3.19</a>.</p>
