<h3>6.4.2 Conflicts with International Environmental Regulation and Trade Law 
</h3>
<p>Compatibility of environmental protection with free trade and/or investment 
  has been important in both the environmental and trade fields. The Committee 
  on Trade and Environment of the WTO has under discussion the relationships between 
  the provisions of the multilateral trading system and trade measures for environmental 
  purposes, including those pursuant to multilateral environmental agreements 
  (MEAs). Also under discussion are the relationships between environmental policies 
  and measures with significant trade effects and the provisions of the multilateral 
  trading system. Some analysts suggest that the WTO is not an appropriate forum 
  to resolve these questions and propose the establishment of a multilateral environmental 
  organization for this purpose (Esty, 1994).</p>
<p>The UNFCCC is one of more than 200 multilateral and bilateral international 
  environmental agreements (MEAs) whose compatibility with free trade and investment 
  is debated (UNEP, 1983, 1991). More than 20 MEAs incorporate explicit trade 
  measures.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#88","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>88</sup></small></a> 
  Other MEAs address the need to co-ordinate restrictions on conduct taken in 
  compliance with obligations they impose and the expanding regime of trade and 
  investment law under the WTO/GATT umbrella.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#89","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>89</sup></small></a> 
  UNFCCC Article 3.5 (UNFCCC, 1992), following GATT Article XX, stipulates that 
  &#147;Parties shall co-operate to promote a supportive and open international 
  economic system that would lead to sustainable economic growth and development 
  in all Parties ... Measures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral 
  ones, should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination 
  or a disguised restriction on international trade.&#148;</p>
<p>There are no presently cited cases of trade claims against measures enacted 
  in widely subscribed MEAs like the CITES or the Montreal Protocol. Neither the 
  UNFCCC nor the Kyoto Protocol now provides for specific trade measures. The 
  debate over conflicts between trade and MEAs stems from the prospect that trade-related 
  measures might be enacted to limit trade in polluting products and in endangered 
  species, or trade in goods created by means of polluting processes and production 
  methods (PPMs). MEAs could also require general or specific trade measures to 
  sanction non-Parties to the MEA or non-compliant MEA members.</p>
<p>IET under Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol has raised questions of WTO compatibility. 
  Early analysis concludes that the rules governing the transfer and mutual recognition 
  of allowances are not covered by WTO because they are neither products nor services 
  (Werksman, 1999).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#90","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>90</sup></small></a> 
  However, several domestic policies and measures that may be taken in conjunction 
  with the Kyoto Protocol might be considered to pose WTO problems, such as excessively 
  restricting trade regulations, GATT-inconsistent border charges, or illegal 
  subsidies.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#91","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>91</sup></small></a></p>
<p>National programmes of permit distribution for emissions trading (see <a href="237.htm">Section 
  6.2.2.3</a>) or national environmental aid (subsidies) might benefit domestic 
  firms or sectors over importers or foreign competitors (Black et al., 2000).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#92","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>92</sup></small></a> 
  In addition, a Party or group of Parties (as part of the national implementation 
  programmes) might apply taxes or environmental policies and measures in a way 
  that arguably discriminates against WTO trade partners. Environmental regulations, 
  taxes, or voluntary measures could be challenged as indirect forms of protection 
  that fall disproportionately on imported products. Recent cases suggest more 
  cases could be argued under the agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) 
  rather than GATT.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#93","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>93</sup></small></a></p>
<p>Trade-related environmental measures traditionally pose problems for the multilateral 
  trading regime. Considerations of sovereignty favour the autonomy of WTO Parties 
  to set health or environmental standards for all products, domestic or imported, 
  consumed in their national territories. Each country has broad discretion to 
  introduce its own policies and measures, including energy efficiency standards 
  and import restrictions, to protect its environment and/or its people&#146;s 
  health, subject to GATT Article 3 (national treatment). However, more debatable 
  is whether GATT permits a government to place restrictions or bans on the import 
  of goods or services, themselves not dangerous or polluting, that are produced 
  outside its borders through PPMs that do not meet its national environmental 
  regulations or standards. PPM issues may be characterized as &#147;clean products 
  produced through dirty processes&#148;. As MEAs increasingly utilize trade measures 
  to prevent non-members from free-riding, the consistency of such trade measures 
  with the relevant GATT articles (Article XX, in particular) has been questioned 
  when they are based on the lack of corresponding PPM requirements in the exporting 
  countries (Murase, 1995, 1996). At present, the relation between WTO-compatible 
  environmental measures and MEAs remains unsettled. It is also unclear whether 
  WTO law is neutral in its treatment of alternative trade-related measures (e.g., 
  standards, taxes, and subsidies).</p>
<p>Prior to 1995, when GATT 1994 replaced GATT 1947 under the WTO agreement, six 
  panel reports involved environmental issues related to trade measures under 
  Article XX (Ahn, 1999). The Appellate Body under the revised WTO dispute settlement 
  system has since decided two further cases.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#94","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>94</sup></small></a> 
  While none of these disputes challenged the environmental objectives pursued 
  by the governments concerned, all rulings found that the contested trade restrictions 
  were in some respect discriminatory or unnecessarily trade restrictive. However, 
  more recent rulings, including those of the Appellate Body, have narrowed or 
  rejected earlier panel interpretations that had held PPMs either per se inconsistent 
  with the intent of GATT or highly restricted by the terms of Article XX.</p>
<p>The GATT Panel rulings in the Tuna&#150;Dolphin I dispute read Articles XXb 
  and XXg so as to preclude provisional justification for extraterritorial PPMs 
  as inherently arbitrary measures destructive to the system of international 
  trade.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#95","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>95</sup></small></a> 
  The panel in the Shrimp&#150;Turtle dispute also explicitly held that the US 
  shrimp embargo belonged to the class of measures (PPMs) that threatened the 
  multilateral trading system and therefore violated the terms of the Chapeau 
  of Article XX. However, the WTO Appellate Body overruled the Panel&#146;s view 
  in the Shrimp&#150;Turtle case. The WTO indicated implicitly that it does not 
  categorically disallow the use of extrajurisdictional PPMs.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#96","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>96</sup></small></a> 
  Although the import restrictions in question applied to shrimp harvesting practices 
  and not to any characteristic of the shrimps themselves, the Appellate Body 
  treated the measure as provisionally justifiable. It considered the legality 
  of the specific restrictions, which were held to be invalid under the prohibition 
  of the Chapeau of Article XX of discriminatory and arbitrary measures. The US 
  embargo was ruled overly broad, its enforcement inflexible in considering the 
  conservation effects of other nations&#146; shrimping practices, disparate in 
  its treatment of other nations, deficient in due process, and put into effect 
  without sufficient good-faith efforts to secure wider multilateral acceptance 
  of its exclusionary programme (Berger, 1999).</p>
<p>Although as yet there is no universally accepted interpretation of the Shrimp&#150;Turtle 
  Appellate Body decision, some analysts suggest the holding implies PPMs no longer 
  violate WTO by their very nature (Ahn, 1999). Others argue such a conclusion 
  is premature legally or has been insufficiently debated and tested in the scientific 
  literature (Jackson, 2000). In either case, the ruling did not refer to important 
  questions relevant to the interaction of WTO and the UNFCCC and/or Kyoto Protocol. 
  It is unclear whether national PPMs need only be enacted by Parties to an MEA 
  in their compliance programmes, or whether each particular PPM, its mode of 
  application, and/or its sanction scheme are the subjects of multilateral accord. 
  Nor is it certain how widely the multilateral agreement that supports the PPM 
  must be subscribed to make it WTO compatible.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#97","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>97</sup></small></a></p>
<p>Parties to MEAs might base national climate programmes on pollution taxes rather 
  than product or PPM standards. WTO law does allow compensating charges or border 
  adjustments to similar imported products to equalize the tax burden on domestic 
  production. While direct taxes (wages, incomes) may not be compensated on imports 
  or refunded on exports, certain indirect taxes, such as sales taxes or excises, 
  may be adjusted at the border.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#98","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>98</sup></small></a> 
  Indirect environmental taxes levied on a locally polluting product like imported 
  fuel or gas guzzling automobiles, as long as not in excess of charges imposed 
  on like domestic products, would be WTO consistent. Analogous indirect taxes, 
  equal to domestic taxes, imposed on non-locally polluting imports produced through 
  foreign process and production methods that were environmentally damaging have 
  been approved in the GATT dispute settlement process.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#99","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>99</sup></small></a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, some border charges on products manufactured through GHG-intensive 
  PPMs might be WTO inconsistent. Although specific taxes on final products (e.g., 
  fuels) and on &#147;goods physically incorporated&#148; into final products 
  (e.g., a feedstock or catalyst) may be adjusted at the border, so-called hidden 
  taxes on inputs, such as transport, machinery, advertising, or energy entirely 
  consumed during production, have not been legally adjustable. Current practice 
  is not fully symmetrical in its treatment of regulatory standards and taxes 
  as environmental instruments.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#100","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>100</sup></small></a></p>
