<h3>10.2.9 Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification </h3>
<p>Studies confirm that in the past compliance of nearly all governments with 
  their binding international environmental obligations has been quite high. However, 
  this often reflects that the commitments were fairly trivial, in many cases 
  simply codifying rather than changing behaviour (Brown Weiss, 1999; Victor and 
  Skolnikoff, 1999). But the effectiveness of these commitments in reducing environmental 
  problems was also low. Incentives to cheat were few and the need for strict 
  monitoring and enforcement was low. As efforts to tackle environmental problems 
  intensified, as in the case of climate change, countries&#146; commitments became 
  more demanding and stringent, the costs and complexity of implementation increased, 
  and thus the incentives to cheat have grown. For this reason, stricter monitoring 
  and enforcement are increasingly essential to ensure that these commitments 
  are implemented fully (Sand, 1996; Victor and Skolnikoff, 1999). The historical 
  record of high compliance without much monitoring and enforcement is a poor 
  indicator of what will be needed for more effective international environmental 
  protection in the future.</p>
<p>Although systematic reviews of implementation are commonplace in many national 
  regulatory programmes (Lykke, 1993), the systematic monitoring, assessment, 
  and handling of implementation failures by international institutions is relatively 
  rare (General Accounting Office, 1992). Nonetheless, efforts to provide such 
  review are growing, and today formal mechanisms for implementation review exist 
  in nearly every recent international environmental agreement. Such mechanisms 
  are incorporated into the UNFCCC structure as well (Victor and Salt, 1995). 
  In addition, many informal mechanisms to review implementation and handle cases 
  of non-compliance often operate in tandem with the formal mechanisms. Together, 
  these formal and informal mechanisms are termed by some researchers as &#147;systems 
  for implementation review&#148;.</p>
<p>An implementation review process is especially vital when decisions are undertaken 
  regarding complex and uncertain problems on the international environmental 
  agenda. Such problems as global warming are still poorly understood, and involve 
  a large number of stakeholders. Since regulation of the many diffused actors 
  is often complex, governments cannot be sure in advance whether their efforts 
  to put international commitments into practice will be successful. Moreover, 
  some governments may intentionally violate their international obligations. 
  Thus, there is a need to review implementation and handle problems that arise. 
  Implementation review can also make it easier to identify problems with existing 
  agreements, which can aid the process of renegotiation and adjustment. However, 
  until recently implementation review has neither been the topic of much research 
  nor high on the policy agenda.</p>
<p>International agreements that include procedures for gathering and reviewing 
  information on implementation and handling implementation problems, as for the 
  UNFCCC, are more likely to be effective than those in which little effort is 
  given to developing the functions of implementation review (Z&uuml;rn, 1996; 
  Victor <i>et al</i>., 1998). Agreements contain prescriptions for the governments to 
  report regularly the data on their emissions and implementation measures. This 
  has made parties more accountable for the implementation of their commitments, 
  helped to direct assistance that facilitates compliance, and provided information 
  and assessments that make it easier to adjust agreements over time.</p>
<p>Within the decision-making process regarding UNFCCC implementation, today more 
  attention is given to assessing national emissions, policy, and measures. The 
  process of compiling GHG emission inventories is well underway. Parties to the 
  UNFCCC are obliged to compile and submit national communications on how they 
  are implementing the convention (Green, 1995). These reports include inventories 
  of GHG emissions, reports on policies and measures that the parties have adopted 
  to try to stabilize or reduce emissions, and (eventually) an account of the 
  extent to which emission abatement has been successful. Since 1991, IPCC and 
  the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have built 
  effective guidelines for inventory reporting. All parties to the convention 
  must use this system of reporting to the UNFCCC regarding emissions by sources 
  and removals by sinks. Within this framework the governments are actively contributing 
  to the international reporting process in submitting their national reports. 
  Experts regard data reported by them as the backbone of the IPCC international 
  system, while the EU is also engaging its own system &#150; Coordination-Information-Air 
  (CORINAIR). Without good data, systems of implementation review work poorly 
  or not at all (Lanchbery, 1998). This system was intended to be applicable to 
  all countries and for the main emissions sector (that for energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions), and it makes use of energy flow statistics of the type that most 
  developed countries collect routinely. Special methodologies and guidelines 
  have been elaborated to convert the national inventory systems reasonably well, 
  certainly for energy-related emissions, into the IPCC format. In this and in 
  other respects it is what is known largely as a &#147;top down&#147; system.</p>
