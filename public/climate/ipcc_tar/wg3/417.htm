<h4>10.3.2.4 Interaction of Climate Policy with other Objectives </h4>
<p>The linkages between the social, economic, environmental, and political dimensions 
  of sustainable development call for policies that can serve multiple objectives, 
  and requires that a balance be struck when objectives conflict. These linkages 
  are often mutually reinforcing in the long run, but may sometimes be contradictory 
  in the short term (OECD, 1999c). In this regard, a critical requirement of sustainable 
  development is a capacity to design policy measures that, without hindering 
  development and remaining consistent with national strategies, could exploit 
  potential synergies between national economic growth objectives and environmentally 
  focused policies. Climate change mitigation strategies offer a clear example 
  of how co-ordinated and harmonized policies can take advantage of the synergies 
  between the implementation of mitigation options and broader objectives.</p>
<p>Over the past years, of the policy options to mitigate climate change, technological 
  options to limit or reduce GHG emissions have received by far the most attention. 
  <a href="089.htm">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="155.htm">4</a> provide a comprehensive 
  review of technologies and practices to mitigate climate change. Energy efficiency 
  improvements (including energy conservation), switches to low carbon-content 
  fuels, use of renewable energy sources, and the introduction of more advanced 
  non-conventional energy technologies are expected to have significant impacts 
  on curbing actual GHG emission tendencies. Similarly, the adoption of new technologies 
  and practices in agriculture and forestry activities, as well as the adoption 
  of clean production processes, could make substantial contributions to the GHG 
  mitigation effort. Depending on the specific context in which they are applied, 
  these options may entail ancillary benefits, and in some cases are worth undertaking 
  whether or not there are climate-related reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>The potential linkages between climate change mitigation issues and economic 
  and social aspects have also brought an important shift in the focus of mitigation 
  analysis literature. From being confined to project-by-project or sector-based 
  approaches, analyses and studies are increasingly concerned with broader policy 
  issues as mechanisms to reduce the increase of GHG emissions. Fresh methodological 
  developments (UNEP, 1998) broaden climate change mitigation policies by incorporating 
  distributional impacts, negative side effects, and the appropriate choice of 
  instruments and institutional constraints, among others. This provides a somewhat 
  different slant on the focus of climate change mitigation policies. More emphasis 
  is now given to exploit mutually reinforcing links among individual actions, 
  to take advantage of the potential interactions of mitigation options with other 
  objectives, and to supplement individual mechanisms with economic instruments 
  of wider scope.</p>
