<h3>3.8.4 New Technological Options </h3>
<a name="3841"></a> 
<h4>3.8.4.1 Fossil Fuelled Electricity Generation</h4>
<a name="38411"></a> 
<h4>3.8.4.1.1 Pulverized Coal</h4>
<p>In a traditional thermal power station, pulverized coal (or fuel oil or gas) 
  is burned in a boiler to generate steam at high temperature and pressure, which 
  is then expanded through a steam turbine to generate electricity. The efficiencies 
  of modern power stations can exceed 40% (lower heating value (LHV)), although 
  the average efficiency, worldwide, of the installed stock is about 30% (Ishitani 
  and Johansson, 1996). The typical cost of a modern coal- fired power station, 
  with SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> controls, is US$1,300/kW (Ishitani and 
  Johansson, 1996). These costs vary considerably and can be more than 50% higher 
  depending on location. Less efficient designs with fewer environmental controls 
  are cheaper.</p>
<p>The development of new materials allows higher steam temperatures and pressures 
  to be used in &#147;supercritical&#148; designs. Efficiencies of 45% are quoted 
  in the Second Assessment Report, although capital costs are significantly higher 
  at around US$1,740/kW (Ishitani and Johansson, 1996). More recently, efficiencies 
  of 48.5% have been reported (OECD, 1998b) and with further development, efficiencies 
  could reach 55% by 2020 (UK DTI, 1999) at costs only slightly higher than current 
  technology (Smith, 2000).</p>
<a name="38412"></a> 
<h4>3.8.4.1.2 Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT)</h4>
<p>Developments in gas turbine technology allow for higher temperatures which 
  lead to higher thermodynamic efficiencies. The overall fuel effectiveness can 
  be improved by capturing the waste heat from the turbine exhaust in a boiler 
  to raise steam to generate electricity through a steam turbine. Thus in such 
  a CCGT plant, electricity is generated by both the gas and steam turbines driving 
  generators. The efficiency of the best available natural gas fired CCGTs currently 
  being installed is now around 60% (LHV) (Goldemberg, 2000) and has been improving 
  at 1% per year in the past decade. Typical capital costs for a power station 
  of 60% efficiency are around US$450-500/kW, including selective catalytic reduction 
  (for NO<sub>x</sub>), dry cooling, switchyard, and a set of spares. Costs can 
  be higher in some regions, especially if new infrastructure is required. These 
  costs have been falling as efficiencies improve (IIASA-WEC, 1998). Together 
  with high availability and short construction times, this makes CCGTs highly 
  favoured by power station developers where gas is available at reasonable prices. 
  Developments in the liquefied natural gas markets could further expand the use 
  of CCGTs. Further improvements might allow electricity generating efficiencies 
  of over 70% to be achievable for CCGTs within a reasonable period (Gregory and 
  Rogner, 1998).</p>
<a name="38413"></a> 
<h4>3.8.4.1.3 Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)</h4>
<p>IGCC systems utilize the efficiency and low capital cost advantages of a CCGT 
  by first gasifying coal or other fuel. Gasifiers are usually oxygen blown and 
  are at the early commercial stage (Goldemberg, 2000). Coal and difficult liquid 
  fuels such as bitumens and tar can be used as feedstocks. Biomass fuels are 
  easier to gasify (<a href="131.htm">Section 3.8.4.3.2</a>), which may 
  reduce the cost and possibly the efficiency penalty as an oxygen plant is not 
  required (Lurgi GmbH, 1989). Gas clean-up prior to combustion in the gas turbine, 
  which is sensitive to contaminants, is one of the current areas of development. 
  The potential efficiency of IGCCs is around 51%, based on the latest CCGTs of 
  60% efficiency (Willerboer, 1997). Vattenfall, using a GE Frame 6 gas turbine, 
  indicated a net efficiency of 48% in trials (Karlsson <i>et al</i>., 1998), and an 
  efficiency of 50%-55% was claimed to be achievable by using the latest gas turbine 
  design. With continuing development in hot gas cleaning and better heat recovery 
  as well as the continuing development of CCGTs, commercially available coal- 
  or wood-fired IGCC power stations with efficiencies over 60% may be feasible 
  by 2020.</p>
<p>In addition to the potential high efficiencies, IGCC offers one of the more 
  promising routes to CO<sub>2</sub> capture and disposal by converting the gas 
  from the gasifier into a stream of H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> via a shift 
  reaction. The CO<sub>2</sub> can then be removed for disposal before entering 
  the gas turbine (see <a href="134.htm#3844">Section 3.8.4.4</a>). The resultant 
  stream of H<sub>2</sub> could be used in fuel cells and not just in a gas turbine.</p>
