<h3>10.3.2 Development Choices and the Potential for Synergy </h3>
<p><a href="048.htm">Chapter 1</a> provides a concise overview of sustainable 
  development as a context for climate change mitigation policy. As argued there, 
  the concept of sustainable development defies objective interpretation or operational 
  implementation. However, it is precisely the diversity of interpretations that 
  &#147;makes up the biggest advantage of the concept: it is sufficiently rich 
  and flexible to refract the full diversity of human interests, values and aspirations&#148; 
  (Raskin <i>et al</i>., 1998). So nearly everyone can agree that sustainable development 
  is a good thing, and consensus has become possible over broad policy areas in 
  which previously people could not agree. Or, in the words of O&#146;Riordan 
  (1993), &#147;sustainable development may be a chimera. It may mark all kinds 
  of contradictions. It may be ambiguously interpreted by all manners of people 
  for all manners of reasons. But as an ideal it is nowadays as persistent a political 
  concept as are democracy, justice and liberty.&#148;</p>
<p>Now, sustainability is perceived as an irreducible, holistic concept in which 
  economic, social, and environmental issues are interdependent dimensions that 
  must be approached in a unified framework. However, the interpretation and valuation 
  of these dimensions give rise to a diversity of approaches. Different disciplines 
  have their own conceptual framework, which translates into different variables, 
  different pathways, and different normative judgements. Economists stress the 
  goal to maximize the net welfare of economic activities, while maintaining or 
  increasing the stock of economic, ecological, and sociocultural assets over 
  time. The social approach tends to highlight questions of inequality and poverty 
  reduction, and environmentalists the questions of natural resource management 
  and ecosystems&#146; resilience (Rotmans, 1997). Apart from the weight placed 
  on each of the critical dimensions, the important conclusion from this ongoing 
  debate is that achieving sustainable economic development, conserving environmental 
  resources, and alleviating poverty and economic injustice are compatible and 
  mutually reinforcing goals in many circumstances.</p>
<p>While the overall literature on sustainable development is very large, the 
  literature that focuses on concrete policies to make operational the concept 
  of sustainable development is, however, much smaller. This asymmetric coverage 
  of the guidance and the operational principles for managing a sustainable development 
  path constitutes a non-negligible barrier to an effective decision-making process, 
  since policymakers lack concise and relevant information that would allow them 
  to assess alternative development choices.</p>
