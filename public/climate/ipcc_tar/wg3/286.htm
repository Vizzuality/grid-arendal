<p><a name="fig72"></a>The literature reports several different baseline scenario 
  concepts, including (Sanstad and Howart, 1994; Halsn&aelig;s <i>et al</i>., 1998; Sathaye 
  and Ravindranath, 1998):</p>
<ul>
  <li>efficient baseline case, which assumes that all resources are employed efficiently; 
    and<br>
  </li>
  <li>&#147;business-as-usual&#148; baseline case , which assumes that future 
    development trends follow those of the past and no changes in policies will 
    take place.</li>
</ul>
<p>These different baseline scenario concepts represent different expectations 
  about future GHG emission development trends, as well as different perspectives 
  on the trade-offs between climate change mitigation policies and other policies. 
  The costs of a given GHG emissions reduction policy depend in a very complicated 
  way on numerous assumptions about future GHG emissions, the potential for emissions 
  reductions, technological developments and penetration, resource costs, and 
  markets. </p>
<p>The different GHG emission profiles of the alternative baseline-scenario approaches 
  depend on a number of assumptions. These include economic growth, mix of products, 
  GHG emissions, intensity of energy production and consumption, and other material 
  use. A &#147;business-as-usual&#148; baseline case is often associated with 
  high GHG emissions, particularly if current main GHG emission sources, such 
  as the energy industry, run at low efficiency. Such a baseline case can reflect 
  the continuation of current energy-subsidy policies (which implies relatively 
  high energy consumption and thereby high GHG emissions) or various other market 
  failures of particular importance for GHG emission intensive sectors, such as 
  capital market constraints. An efficient baseline case that assumes properly 
  functioning markets, all other things being equal, can be expected to reflect 
  relatively high energy efficiency and thereby lower GHG emissions than a business-as-usual 
  baseline case. GHG emission profiles of the different baseline case approaches 
  are illustrated in <a href="#fig72">Figure 7.2</a>.</p>
<p>The GHG emission reduction potential of a given policy is to be measured as 
  the difference between the GHG emissions in the baseline case and the GHG emissions 
  after the implementation of the policy. Clearly, this difference depends on 
  both the baseline and the options chosen for the mitigation. High baseline-scenario 
  GHG emissions based on a business-as-usual scenario approach in some cases can 
  imply that the net mitigation costs measured per unit of GHG emission reduction 
  are relatively low. Such a result, for example, can reflect that the mitigation 
  scenario is assumed to imply a general efficiency improvement of the energy 
  systems compared with the baseline wich both reduces GHG emission and generates 
  fuel cost savings. The total costs of achieving a given GHG emission level (e.g., 
  defined in relation to 1990 emissions), however, can be relatively high when 
  the mitigation strategy is assessed in relation to a business-as-usual baseline 
  scenario that has a large growth in GHG emissions. Conversely, GHG emission 
  reduction costs per unit of emission can be relatively high in relation to an 
  efficient baseline case, but total reduction costs of meeting a target can be 
  low. </p>
<p>It is important to emphasize consistency and transparency in the definition 
  of baselines, and in the reporting of any costs associated in moving from a 
  given baseline case to a climate change policy case. Furthermore, when reporting 
  the range of cost estimates for the different baselines, it is important also 
  to provide information about the assumptions that underlie each baseline.</p>
