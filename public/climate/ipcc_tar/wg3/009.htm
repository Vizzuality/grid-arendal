<h1>Gaps in Knowledge </h1>
<p><a name="24"></a>24. <i>Advances have been made since previous IPCC assessments 
  in the understanding of the scientific, technical, environmental, and economic 
  and social aspects of mitigation of climate change. Further research is required, 
  however, to strengthen future assessments and to reduce uncertainties as far 
  as possible in order that sufficient information is available for policy making 
  about responses to climate change, including research in developing countries. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The following are high priorities for further narrowing gaps between current 
  knowledge and policy making needs:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Further exploration of the regional, country and sector specific potentials 
    of technological and social innovation options</i>. This includes research 
    on the short, medium and long-term potential and costs of both CO<sub>2</sub> 
    and non-CO<sub>2</sub>, non-energy mitigation options; understanding of technology 
    diffusion across different regions; identifying opportunities in the area 
    of social innovation leading to decreased greenhouse gas emissions; comprehensive 
    analysis of the impact of mitigation measures on carbon flows in and out of 
    the terrestrial system; and some basic inquiry in the area of geo-engineering.</li>
  <li><i>Economic, social and institutional issues related to climate change mitigation 
    in all countries</i>. Priority areas include: analysis of regionally specific 
    mitigation options and barriers; the implications of equity assessments; appropriate 
    methodologies and improved data sources for climate change mitigation and 
    capacity building in the area of integrated assessment; strengthening future 
    research and assessments, especially in the developing countries.</li>
  <li><i>Methodologies for analysis of the potential of mitigation options and 
    their cost, with special attention to comparability of results</i>. Examples 
    include: characterizing and measuring barriers that inhibit greenhouse gas-reducing 
    action; making mitigation modelling techniques more consistent, reproducible, 
    and accessible; modelling technology learning; improving analytical tools 
    for evaluating ancillary benefits, e.g. assigning the costs of abatement to 
    greenhouse gases and to other pollutants; systematically analyzing the dependency 
    of costs on baseline assumptions for various greenhouse gas stabilization 
    scenarios; developing decision analytical frameworks for dealing with uncertainty 
    as well as socio-economic and ecological risk in climate policy making; improving 
    global models and studies, their assumptions and their consistency in the 
    treatment and reporting of non-Annex I countries and regions.</li>
  <li> <i>Evaluating climate mitigation options in the context of development, 
    sustainability and equity</i>. Examples include: exploration of alternative 
    development paths, including sustainable consumption patterns in all sectors, 
    including the transportation sector; integrated analysis of mitigation and 
    adaptation; identifying opportunities for synergy between explicit climate 
    policies and general policies promoting sustainable development; integration 
    of intra- and inter-generational equity in climate change mitigation analysis; 
    implications of equity assessments; analysis of scientific, technical and 
    economic implications of options under a wide variety of stabilization regimes.</li>
</ul>
