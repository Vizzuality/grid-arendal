<h3><a name="152"></a>1.5.2 Lessons from Integrated Analyses </h3>
<p>Integrating, organizational tools are most useful when they also provide an 
  effective means to assess the existing literature so that new hypotheses can 
  be articulated and new directions can be identified. </p>
<p>One such lesson is that to aggregate representations of mitigation across nations 
  and/or groups may be misleading. Quite simply, the capacity to reduce emissions 
  of GHGs can vary dramatically from nation to nation, sector to sector, region 
  to region, group to group, and timeframe to timeframe.</p>
<p>Secondly, one country can easily display high adaptive capacity and low mitigative 
  capacity simultaneously (or visa versa), even though both capacities share the 
  same list of determinants. In a wealthy nation the damages associated with climate 
  change may focus on a small but well-connected group of people, while the cost 
  of a wide range of adaptation options can, through a well established tax system, 
  be distributed across the entire population. The same country might, however, 
  include another small group of people who would be seriously hurt by most if 
  not all of the wide range of available mitigation options and/or policies. The 
  benefits of mitigation would meanwhile be marginal for most people because they 
  would be distributed widely across the population and spread far into the future. 
  Mitigative capacity could then be small.</p>
<p>Countries most vulnerable to climate change may have the smallest mitigative 
  capacity. Vulnerability to climate change results from high exposure to climate 
  impacts, low adaptive capacity, or both. In the high-exposure case, the opportunity 
  cost, broadly defined, of expending resources to mitigate GHG emissions may 
  be too high. In the case of low adaptive capacity, the factors responsible may 
  also work to diminish mitigative capacity. And in the third case, both deleterious 
  correlations could work to complement each other. </p>
<p>Enhancing any one component of mitigative capacity may (or may not) reduce 
  the (marginal) cost of mitigation, because it either expands the set of possible 
  mitigative options or because it reduces the constraints that stand in the way 
  of their efficient application. Adding to the list of available technological 
  options can, of course, lower the cost of implementing a specific policy designed 
  to accomplish a specific objective, but the additions must be more socially 
  acceptable than the existing alternatives, as well as structurally, socially, 
  politically, and culturally feasible. If not, they will not be adopted. Furthermore, 
  their informational requirements must not exceed the informational capacity 
  of the host country. </p>
<p>A nation, region, or community&#146;s international position can play a significant 
  role in determining its ability to exercise its mitigative capacity, because 
  outside entities can influence the effectiveness of technological options and/or 
  domestic policy alternatives. External forces can have a secondary but nonetheless 
  significant effect on the likelihood that mitigation will occur.<a href="051.htm"> 
  Section 1.2</a> highlights the value of international co-ordination. Trade policies, 
  be they global or the domestic policies of significant trading partners, directly 
  influence national incomes and their distribution. Trade also influences the 
  degree to which a country&#146;s development plans put pressure on its stocks 
  of social, human, and natural capital. Each of these factors subsequently affects 
  the constraints that determine the set of feasible mitigation technologies and 
  policies.</p>
<p>Developing indicators of mitigative capacity could help determine who should 
  be expected to do what in terms of mitigation. Examining the determinants of 
  mitigative capacity can identify weak points in the links required for countries 
  to recognize and to act upon the need for climate mitigation This approach can 
  organize existing information effectively as well as suggest new research directions. 
  Specifically, attention to mitigative capacity underlines the role of instruments 
  and targets in framing policy discussions. There are, typically, multiple targets 
  (environmental improvement being one of them) and multiple instruments to achieve 
  them. Contemplating the determinants of mitigative capacity suggests that there 
  is a benefit from broadening the range of instruments used in climate policy. 
  This may be especially so if &#147;climate policy&#148; is understood to include 
  mechanisms to achieve environmental goals, sustainability goals, equity goals, 
  and development goals. In this light, mitigative capacity highlights the necessity 
  to observe market failures, political failures, and other failures that might 
  otherwise be overlooked. The fundamental questions are, then, ones of a broad 
  perspective to see exactly how much public policy should be devoted to enhancing 
  mitigative capacity in ways that can help answer questions like &#147;Where 
  are the payoffs clearly greater than the costs?&#148; or &#147;Where is the 
  low-hanging fruit that deserves picking?&#148;</p>
<p>Contemplating the complexity of mitigative capacity reveals that the sources 
  of uncertainty in understanding mitigation extend far beyond the boundaries 
  of the uncertainties that cloud how various technologies might be applied and 
  how various policy designs might function. The same determinants of mitigative 
  capacity that bring development, equity, and sustainability factors into play 
  add to the list of these sources, just as they do on the impact side of the 
  climate change calculus. In short, therefore, anticipating how mitigation might 
  evolve, how much it might cost, how effective it might be, and how the costs 
  and benefits might be distributed is just as uncertain as anticipating how systems 
  might adapt to the impacts of climate change and climate variability. </p>
<p>Understanding the determinants of mitigative capacity offers a way of organizing 
  not only the analysis of mitigation, but also the negotiations over how to meet 
  the mitigation challenge. Indeed, enhancing mitigative capacity can be a policy 
  objective in and of itself. The means by which this enhancement might be accomplished 
  can be drawn directly from an understanding of how the determinants work within 
  and across countries, how they might complement one another, and how they might 
  conflict. Of course, the opportunity cost of enhancing mitigative capacity, 
  measured in terms of cost of regressing against other objectives, is critical 
  in evaluating its desirability. It is also clear, given the way in which its 
  determinants can be expected to interact, that enhancing mitigative capacity 
  means more than simply transferring resources from one nation to another. Weakness 
  beyond access to adequate resources can surely impede the capacity to mitigate 
  any stress; and so it follows that these weaknesses can undermine significantly 
  the efficacy of offering or requesting simple financial support.</p>
<h3><a name="153"></a>1.5.3 Mitigation Research: Current Lessons and Future Directions 
</h3>
<p>Broadening the domain of analysis to include concerns of development, equity, 
  and sustainability over multiple time scales adds enormous complexity to policy 
  deliberations. A portfolio of strategies (not just policy instruments) that 
  draw on efficiency and cost-effectiveness, equity, and sustainability considerations 
  may nonetheless offer the promise of identifying new options and synergies that 
  may make the job of implementing climate policy less disruptive to societies 
  and economies. In particular, it may help to broaden the range of win&#150;win 
  options. </p>
<p>Concepts like mitigative capacity can help to clarify the trade-offs within 
  and between this expanded range of options. It can show how the assessment of 
  climate change mitigation opportunities contained in this volume can be used 
  and integrated to confront the problem of climate change most effectively. This 
  is especially true when the broad lessons from WGIII herein are taken in concert 
  with lessons drawn from the assessment provided by WGII (IPCC, 2001) on impacts 
  and adaptation. Many of the determinants of adaptive capacity are essentially 
  the same as those of mitigative capacity. Therefore, a portfolio of policy strategies 
  that enhances the capacity to mitigate most effectively should also be effective 
  in enhancing the capacity to adapt. A number of lessons and directions for future 
  research can be enumerated. </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Improved deliberations on appropriate climate policies in the short, 
    medium, and long terms.</i><br>
    The literature being brought to bear on the climate issue increasingly shows 
    that policies beyond simply reducing GHG emissions from a specified baseline 
    at minimum costs can be extremely effective in abating the emission of GHGs. 
    Consideration of policies not directly focused on climate, such as those focused 
    on the broader objectives of sustainable development, gives policymakers more 
    flexibility to achieve climate policy objectives.</li>
  <li><i> Expanded lists of tools for decision makers and analysts. </i><br>
    Consideration of the objectives of development, equity, and sustainability 
    can help buy in more participants to climate policies&#150;beyond national 
    and international delegations to include state, local, community, and household 
    agents, as well as NGOs. It also expands the list of tools that can be applied 
    to illuminate the decision-makers&#146; deliberations, from efficiency- and/or 
    distribution-based analytical tools to include alternative decision-analytic 
    frameworks and the development of alternative scenarios. </li>
  <li><i>Weighing the costs and impacts of a broader set of policies according 
    to a longer list of objectives.</i><br>
    Climate deliberations would then consider the climate ramifications of policies 
    designed primarily to address a wide range of issues, including development, 
    equity, sustainability, and sustainable development, as well as the likely 
    impacts of climate policies on the achievement of these other objectives. 
    As part of this process the opportunity costs and impacts of each instrument 
    are measured against the multiple criteria defined by these multiple objectives.</li>
  <li><i>A portfolio approach to policy that effectively enhances the capacity 
    to meet the mitigation challenge as well as the capacity to adapt to climate 
    change.</i><br>
    Focusing research and policy on the determinants of mitigative and adaptive 
    capacity simultaneously can show when, where, and how synergies and conflicts 
    between mitigation and adaptation might arise. Focusing research on these 
    determinants also makes it clear that policy making in either sphere can be 
    matched by complementary action in the other. Coping with the climate problem 
    is not a question of mitigating and then adapting. Nor is it a question of 
    adapting and then mitigating. It is a more holistic question of doing both 
    at the same time; focusing attention on the common determinants of mitigative 
    and adaptive capacities can lead productively to an understanding of exactly 
    how to meet these coincident challenges. </li>
  <li><i>Much additional research is needed before concepts like mitigative capacity 
    can be used to assess the relative merits of specific options.<br>
    </i>Integrating concepts like mitigative capacity should prove useful as a 
    heuristic device to integrate diverse policy instruments into a comprehensive 
    policy portfolio, to discover the metrics with which costs and benefits should 
    be measured, and (perhaps most immediately) to broaden the range of no regrets 
    options.</li>
</ul>
