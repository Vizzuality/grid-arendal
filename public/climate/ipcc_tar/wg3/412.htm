<h4>10.3.2.2 Technological and Policy Options and Choices </h4>
<p>It is clear from the preceding discussion that governments&#146; commitments 
  to sustainable development require indicators by which decision makers can evaluate 
  their performance in achieving specific goals and targets. Furthermore, such 
  indicators are essential, first to capture the complex interlinkages between 
  the basic building blocks of sustainable development (environment, economic 
  activity, and the social fabric), and second to balance the unavoidable trade-offs 
  between the main policy issues related to each of these blocks (development, 
  equity, and sustainability).</p>
<p>It is difficult to generalize about sustainable development policies and choices. 
  Sustainability implies and requires diversity, flexibility, and innovation. 
  Thus, there cannot be one &#147;rightful&#148; path of sustainable development 
  that leads finally to a blissful state of sustainability (Bossel, 1998). Depending 
  upon differences among individual countries (size, level of industrialization, 
  cultural values, etc.) as well as on the heterogeneity within countries, policy 
  choices are meant to introduce changes in:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Technological patterns of natural resource use, production of goods and 
    services, and final consumption</i>. These encompass individual technological 
    options and choices as well as overall technological systems. Sustainable 
    development on a global scale requires radical technological changes focused 
    on the efficient use of materials and energy for the sufficient coverage of 
    needs, and with minimum impact on the environment, society, and future. This 
    is of particular importance in developing countries, in which a major part 
    of the infrastructure needed can avoid past practices and move more rapidly 
    towards technologies that use resources in a more sustainable way, recycle 
    more wastes and products, and handle residual wastes in a more acceptable 
    manner. As discussed in <a href="089.htm">Chapter 3</a>, the range of opportunities 
    is extensive enough to cope with different development styles and national 
    circumstances, but what is even more important, economic potential increases 
    as result of the continuous process of technological change and innovation. 
    A number of technologies that less than 10 years ago were at the laboratory-prototype 
    stage are now available in the markets. Issues on barriers and opportunities 
    for technology development, transfer, and diffusion at the national level 
    are discussed in <a href="179.htm">Chapter 5</a> and <a href="421.htm">Section 
    10.3.3</a> below.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Structural changes in the production system</i>. Economic growth continues 
    to be a widely pursued objective of most governments and, therefore, policy 
    decisions on development patterns may have direct impacts on both raw material 
    and the energy content of production. Structural changes towards services 
    or a low energy-intensity industrial base may or may not affect the overall 
    level of economic activity, but could have significant impacts on the energy 
    content of goods and services.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Spatial distribution patterns of population and economic activities</i>. 
    Country-wide policies on the geographical distribution of human settlements 
    and productive activities impact on sustainable development at three levels: 
    on the evolution of land uses, on mobility needs and transport requirements, 
    and on the energy requirements. These factors are of utmost relevance for 
    most developing countries, in which spatial distributions of the population 
    and of economic activities are not yet settled. Therefore, these countries 
    are in a position to adopt urban and/or regional planning and industrial policies 
    directed towards a more balanced use of their geographical space.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Behavioural patterns that determine the evolution of lifestyles</i>. 
    Consumption behaviours, and individual choices in general, have a critical 
    influence on sustainable development. After all, sustainability is a global 
    project that requires big and small daily contributions from almost everybody 
    (Bossel, 1998). Personal opportunities and freedom of choices are embedded 
    in cultures and habits, but these are also shaped and supported by the products 
    and services provided by the economic system, as well as by the organization 
    and administration at all levels. Within the boundaries of individual freedom, 
    government policies can discourage unsound consumption styles and encourage 
    more sustainable social behaviour through the adoption of financial incentives 
    (subsidies), disincentives (taxes), legal constraints, and the provision of 
    wider choices of infrastructure and services. This point is elaborated further 
    in <a href="413.htm">Section 10.3.2.3</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The set of specific policies, measures, and instruments to mitigate climate 
  change and consequently promote sustainable development is quite large. These 
  include generic policies oriented to induce changes in the behaviour of economic 
  agents, or control and regulatory measures to achieve specific targets at the 
  sectoral level. A comprehensive discussion of various aspects of different types 
  of policies and measures is presented in <a href="224.htm">Chapter 6</a>. 
  Here it is important to note, first, that sustainability issues cannot be addressed 
  by single isolated measures, but they require a whole set of integrated and 
  mutually reinforced policies. Second, weights assigned to different policies 
  depend on individual countries according to their national circumstances and 
  specific priorities. Third, the cause&#150;effect reaction in the process of 
  policy implementation is not linear. Except in trivial cases, policies tend 
  to disrupt existing patterns, social systems create and respond to changes within 
  themselves through feedback loops, and new patterns emerge as social, economic, 
  and environmental aspects interact in the process of convergence towards the 
  desired goals.</p>
