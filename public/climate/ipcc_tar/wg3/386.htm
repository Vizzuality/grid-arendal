<h4>10.1.2.4 Uncertainty Is Pervasive </h4>
<p>There are many uncertainties regarding the magnitude of future climate change, 
  its consequences and the costs, benefits and implementation barriers of possible 
  solutions. Future emissions to the atmosphere are inherently uncertain and can 
  only be explored on the basis of scenarios. The change in concentration of GHGs 
  that would result from a given emission rate is much less uncertain. But the 
  timing, extent, and distribution of climate change and sea level rise for a 
  given concentration of GHGs is not well known due to limitations in modelling 
  climate change at the regional level. The impacts of climate change on ecosystems 
  and humanity is known with limited certainty. The potential for an unspecified, 
  low-probability, but catastrophic turn of events haunts the problem. </p>
<p>While uncertainties are great, they are not distributed evenly throughout the 
  problem. The cost implications of emissions mitigation are better known than 
  the more distant (in time) potential benefits from mitigation. In part this 
  is because of temporal proximity, but it is also because most of the costs associated 
  with emissions mitigation pass through markets, whereas many of the benefits 
  do not. Some uncertainties will remain unresolved regardless of the decisions 
  made. This follows directly from the fact that there is only one observed history. 
  All the other potential histories are counterfactual, and therefore constructs 
  from analytical tools that are limited in their veracity. In decision making 
  terms the problem of climate change mitigation requires decision making under 
  uncertainty. Given the long lead times of mitigation action, fully resolving 
  uncertainties would make an adequate response infeasible.</p>
<h4><a name="10125"></a>10.1.2.5 The Consequences Are Potentially Irreversible</h4>
<p>Many global biogeochemical processes have long time scales. Sea level changes 
  as a consequence of changes in mean global temperature can take more than 1000 
  years to play out. Similarly, changes in the concentration of GHGs can rise 
  rapidly, but decline slowly. And, even if concentrations can be reduced, the 
  nature of the climate system is such that it might not return to the same climatic 
  state associated with an earlier concentration.</p>
<h4><a name="10126"></a>10.1.2.6 The Global Institutions Needed to Address the 
  Issue Are only Partially Formed</h4>
<p>The UNFCCC has been ratified by more than 170 parties and entered into force 
  in 1994. It provides the institutional foundations upon which international 
  climate change negotiations occur. It sets as its ultimate objective the stabilization 
  of the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere at levels that prevent dangerous 
  anthropogenic interferences with the climate. However, the UNFCCC establishes 
  a process and does not create the institutions for implementing the objective. 
  The objective has not yet been quantified. The term &#147;dangerous&#148; is 
  left open to interpretation by the parties.</p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol of December 1997, described in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  1</a>, represents a further important step in the international regime formation 
  under the UNFCCC. The Kyoto Protocol has brought a number of new elements and 
  broadened the context of the decision-making process regarding implementation 
  of climate change policy. Ultimately, further institutional development is needed 
  for the UNFCCC to meet its final objective.</p>
