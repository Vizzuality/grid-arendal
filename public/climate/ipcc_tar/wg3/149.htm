<h2>A3.3 Foams</h2>
<a name="a331"></a> 
<h3>A3.3.1 Insulating Foams</h3>
<p>The global market for thermal insulation materials is large, complex, and has 
  substantial regional variation. Since the prime purpose of insulation in addition 
  to energy conservation is to maintain appropriate ambient conditions within 
  a defined space, insulation use is affected most by external climatic conditions. 
  However, in developing countries per-capita use is often lower than local climatic 
  conditions would predict. Increasing insulation use can therefore often go towards 
  improving comfort levels as well as saving energy use and resultant carbon dioxide 
  emissions. </p>
<p>Climatic conditions, space constraints, local building code requirements, and 
  construction costs can all influence the choice of insulation material. In mass 
  markets polymeric foams offer the best insulation performance at higher unit 
  cost. The thermal efficiency of foam is influenced by the choice of blowing 
  agent, and HFCs promise to yield a performance similar to that of previously 
  used HCFCs (UNEP, 1998d).</p>
<p>In Europe, where construction applications dominate, the market for insulation 
  foams, polyurethane, extruded polystyrene, and phenolic resins accounts for 
  about 13% of the total insulation market. Mineral fibres and expanded polystyrene 
  have historically been the dominant materials in terms of volume and mass (roughly 
  80%), primarily on grounds of lower unit cost. However, performance characteristics 
  are becoming an increasingly important factor in material selection to meet 
  the demands of greater prefabrication.</p>
<p>In North America, the timber frame method of construction has contributed to 
  a more widespread use of polyurethane (PU), polyisocyanurate (PIR), and extruded 
  polystyrene foams. The PU and PIR systems also have better production economics 
  than in Europe because of higher line speeds and less stringent thickness tolerance 
  criteria. In Japan, the market is shaped by strict fire codes and much of the 
  construction is based around concrete. PU spray foams have done particularly 
  well in enclosed spaces and use of phenolic foam is preferred in some exposed 
  applications because of its lower flammability compared to other alternatives. 
  In developing countries, the use of foam for cold storage applications predominates.</p>
<p>Where HFCs are used, they will be emitted during the manufacturing and over 
  the life of the foam (25&#150;50 years). Retention in the foam at end-of-life 
  will generally depend on the thickness of the foam and the facings used.</p>
<a name="a332"></a> 
<h3>A3.3.2 Insulating Foams in Appliances</h3>
<p>Appliance foams are currently produced with either hydrocarbons or HCFC-141b. 
  Foams produced with HCFC-141b generally provide 5%-15% more insulation per unit 
  of thickness than those produced with other blowing agents. HFCs (primarily 
  &#147;liquid&#148; HFCs such as HFC-245fa and HFC-365mfc) are anticipated to 
  partly replace HCFCs because they produce foams with similar insulating properties. 
  The contribution of the foam to the overall energy efficiency of the appliance 
  is important since the energy used to operate the appliance accounts for the 
  majority of the global warming impacts in most cases.</p>
<p>Where HFCs are selected, options to reduce emissions include the use of formulations 
  that minimize the amount and GWP of the blowing agent used, and the end-life 
  destruction of the HFC. The latter is particularly important, since it is technically 
  possible to recover and destroy over 90% of the HFC blowing agent at an estimated 
  cost-effectiveness of between US$30 and US$100/tC<sub>eq</sub> (AFEAS, 2000).</p>
<p>A recent study for the European Commission (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000) estimates 
  that in Europe about 70% of all polyurethane foams for appliances will be blown 
  with hydrocarbons and about 30% with HFCs by 2010. HFCs are more likely to be 
  selected where more stringent energy standards exist. In contrast, the investment 
  related to the introduction of a new blowing agent might play a determining 
  role in developing countries. However, in practice, this effect has been broadly 
  offset by the supporting activities of the multilateral fund. Significant concern 
  about hydrocarbon use exists in North America and Japan, related to product 
  liability and process safety costs. </p>
<p>Vacuum panels may partly replace insulation foam in the future but the cost-effectiveness 
  of this option is uncertain. A few domestic and commercial applications already 
  use vacuum insulation panels in combination with polyurethane foams. These systems 
  have up to 20% lower energy consumption than those using CFC or HCFC blown foam 
  insulation systems (UNEP, 1998d).</p>
<a name="a333"></a> 
<h3>A3.3.3 Insulating Foams in Residential Buildings</h3>
<p>The use of HFC blown foams in the residential sector is expected to be relatively 
  limited because of the high cost-sensitivity of this market. However, it is 
  preferable to base the choice of insulation for all buildings on a proper consideration 
  of the LCCP, including the comparative energy saving impacts of alternative 
  insulation materials, the potential emissions of blowing agents, and the embodied 
  energies of the insulating materials themselves. Where HFCs are used, the cost 
  to destroy the HFC will be determined primarily by the cost of separating the 
  construction materials. There are trends towards prefabricated construction 
  and requirements for recycling of building materials in some regions that could 
  lower these costs in time. Emissions of HFCs partially offset the benefits of 
  low energy consumption arising from their use. </p>
<p>The use of hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide as blowing agents for polyurethane 
  and extruded polystyrene insulation foams is expanding. A recent European study 
  (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000) estimated that by 2010 about 50% of all polyurethane 
  and extruded polystyrene foams in this sector will be blown by hydrocarbons 
  and carbon dioxide, respectively. It is estimated that substituting the remaining 
  HFCs by hydrocarbon use in the mass markets of polyurethane foam production 
  would cost between US$90 and US$125/tC<sub>eq</sub>. There is some concern about 
  the use of flammable hydrocarbons in the residential environment and indoor 
  air quality could also be affected. The replacement of HFCs by CO<sub>2</sub>/water 
  blown polyurethane spray systems is estimated to be available at a cost-effectiveness 
  of about US$80/tC<sub>eq</sub> (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000). In Europe, one 
  major producer is converting its extruded polystyrene production lines to use 
  CO<sub>2</sub> as the blowing agent. The cost-effectiveness of the use of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  as the blowing agent for extruded polystyrene is estimated at US$40/tC<sub>eq</sub> 
  (March, 1998) and at US$25/tC<sub>eq</sub> (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000) for 
  the remaining manufacturers in Europe.</p>
<p>Fibrous insulation materials and expanded polystyrene are used extensively 
  for residential construction in most parts of the world. The increased thickness 
  required to achieve a desired energy efficiency can cost more; however, builders 
  have been willing to increase the cavity wall size substantially since the 1970s 
  to comply with increasing insulation standards in some regions.</p>
<a name="a334"></a>
<h3>A3.3.4 Insulating Foams in Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>For commercial buildings, the choice of foam type and facings is more likely 
  to be based on lifetime costs (performance related) than on initial cost. An 
  additional factor is the increased use of prefabricated building techniques, 
  particularly in Europe. Both aspects suggest that HFC blown foams could penetrate 
  the commercial and industrial sectors to a greater extent than the residential 
  sector previously discussed. Harnisch and Hendriks (2000) estimate that avoiding 
  HFCs in most mass applications by switching to hydrocarbon systems would cost 
  in the region of US$90 to US$125/tC<sub>eq</sub>. For the switch from HFC to CO<sub>2</sub> use in 
  extruded polystyrene, one study estimates US$40/tC<sub>eq</sub> (March, 1998), whilst another 
  (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000) estimates US$25/tC<sub>eq</sub> for the remaining European 
  manufacturers. </p>
<p>Fibrous insulation materials and expanded polystyrene are used extensively 
  for commercial construction and are expected to play a significant role in the 
  future. However, whether this role will expand technically seems in doubt.</p>
<a name="a335"></a>
<h3>A3.3.5 Insulating Foams in Transportation </h3>
<p>Hydrocarbon blown foams and vacuum insulation panels are alternative options. 
  Hydrocarbon blown foams have a somewhat lower insulating value per unit of thickness 
  than HFC blown foams, and the vacuum insulating panels currently cost substantially 
  more. Insulating performance is crucial in this sub-sector and serious thickness 
  constraints exist, limiting the available options.</p>
<a name="a336"></a>
<h3>A3.3.6 Other Insulating Foams</h3>
<p>Another application of HFCs for insulating foams will be in industrial process 
  applications, where an estimated 2500 tonnes will be used &#150; primarily in 
  process pipework. Owing to high foam densities in this sector the differences 
  in insulation performance between different blowing agents are small. For Europe 
  it is estimated (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000) that in 2010 hydrocarbons will 
  have a market share of 50% of the pipe insulation production. </p>
<p>Both the building industry and the do-it-yourself market use one-component 
  foams in a variety of applications, including sound and thermal insulation applications. 
  The thermal conductivity of the foam, however, is not a critical requirement. 
  HFC-134a and HFC-152a, hydrocarbons, propane, butane, and dimethyl ether (DME) 
  are all technically suitable and in use. These are frequently used in blends; 
  for example, a blend of HFC-134a/DME/propane/butane is widely used in Europe 
  (UNEP, 1998d). Some replacement of HFC use in this sector is likely although 
  concerns over the flammability of mixtures may delay this process in some regions.</p>
<a name="a337"></a>
<h3>A3.3.7 Non-Insulating Foams</h3>
<p>Non-insulation HFC blown foams are expected to be used only in those applications 
  where product or process safety are paramount, for example, integral skin foams 
  for safety applications. Harnisch and Hendriks (2000) project that HFCs will 
  not be required for the production of non-insulation foams in Europe. However, 
  in view of different product specifications elsewhere in the world, liquid HFCs 
  could replace a significant part of the current small use of HCFCs.</p>
