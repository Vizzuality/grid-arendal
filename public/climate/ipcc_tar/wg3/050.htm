<h2><a name="11"></a>1.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter puts climate change mitigation and climate change mitigation policy 
  in the broader context of development, equity, and sustainability. The ultimate 
  objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
  &#147;is to achieve &#133; stabilization of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations 
  in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference 
  with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a timeframe 
  sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure 
  that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to 
  proceed in a sustainable manner&#148; (Article 2). 
  The UNFCCC goes on to specify principles that should guide this process: equity, 
  common but differentiated responsibilities, precaution, cost-effectiveness, 
  the right to sustainable development, and the avoidance of arbitrary restriction 
  on international trade (Article 3). Previous Intergovernmental 
  Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports sought to lay the groundwork 
  for policymakers pursuing the UNFCCC goals by comprehensively describing, cataloguing, 
  and comparing technologies and policy instruments that could be used to achieve 
  the mitigation of GHG emissions. </p>
<p>The attention accorded in the UNFCCC to sustainable development&#150;including 
  the recognition that &#147;Parties have a right to, and should promote sustainable 
  development&#148; (Article 3.4)&#150;has not, however, 
  been matched by its treatment in previous IPCC assessment reports. As a result, 
  the present assessment seeks to address this mismatch by placing policy evaluations 
  in the broader context of development, equity, and sustainability as outlined 
  in the Convention. The rising stature of development, equity, and sustainability 
  in the discussion of mitigation is, indeed, entirely consistent with the overall 
  evolution of the scope of the literature on climate change. </p>
<p>In fact, the analysis of climate change policies has evolved significantly 
  between the preparation of the First Assessment Report (FAR; IPCC, 1991), the 
  Second Assessment Report (SAR; IPCC, 1996), and Third Assessment Report (TAR) 
  of the IPCC. In the late 1980s, for example, the focus of policy analysis was 
  almost exclusively on climate change mitigation through emissions reduction. 
  GHG emissions were modelled almost exclusively in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
  from energy use (Nordhaus and Yohe, 1983; Edmonds and Reilly, 1985); and emissions 
  reductions were to be achieved primarily by increasing the prices of fossil 
  fuels. Hence, it is hardly surprising that, with a few exceptions (e.g., Bradley 
  and Williams, 1989; Parikh et al., 1991), carbon taxes were overwhelmingly the 
  most commonly analyzed policy instrument. FAR (IPCC, 1991) documents the possible 
  ramifications of a wide range of policy instruments, but it reports that carbon 
  taxes are again the most fully analyzed in the literature. This report, by way 
  of contrast, demonstrates a significant enhancement in the capacity of policy 
  analysts to consider the sources and sinks of multiple gases as well as a broader 
  array of policy instruments to curtailing the emission of these gases into the 
  atmosphere.</p>
<p>Also, little consideration was given in FAR to policies designed to enhance 
  adaptation to climate change impacts. In TAR, though, adaptation has become 
  a major focus of the Working Group II (WGII) report (IPCC, 2001). At the beginning 
  of the 1990s, assessments of the capabilities of countries to achieve emissions 
  reductions were almost exclusively based on estimates of their fossil fuel consumption. 
  With a few exceptions (e.g., Grubb, 1991; Rayner, 1993) no explicit consideration 
  was given to social, cultural, political, institutional, or decision-making 
  constraints on the capacity of governments to implement climate change policies. 
</p>
<p>Consistent with the state of the policy literature on climate change, FAR (IPCC, 
  1991) also made no attempt to address issues of equity. Prior to the publication 
  of Global Warming in an Unequal World (Agarwal and Narain, 1991a), consideration 
  of the fairness of climate change policies (both among and within countries) 
  received little attention from analysts and policymakers (for exceptions see 
  Grubb, 1989; Kasperson and Dow, 1991; Parikh et al., 1991). The IPCC Second 
  Assessment Report WGIII (IPCC WG III, 1996) did, however, 
  mention the need to extend the focus of analysis and assessment into areas that 
  included issues not only of equity and fairness, but also of development and 
  sustainability. Some of the studies available then did note the distributional 
  effects of alternative policy designs and targets; and some did trace other 
  effects into the domains of development and sustainability. The point here is 
  not that earlier work ignored these broader issues, but that this report begins 
  the process of making them more central in the assessment of the existing policy 
  analyses. This report begins the task of integrating technology and policy characterizations 
  into alternative development scenarios and policy decision-frameworks that are 
  broadly conceived. In the same spirit, this chapter seeks to locate the work 
  of WGIII in a broader context of development, equity, and sustainability. In 
  the process, we draw on several themes (elaborated in subsequent chapters) to 
  identify opportunities to enhance the capacity of regions, countries, and communities 
  to mitigate GHG emissions while simultaneously pursuing their sustainable development 
  goals. Neither the greenhouse gas mitigation nor the sustainable development 
  initiative, however, eliminates the need to conduct efficiency-based assessments 
  of the opportunity costs of mitigation and/or the enhancement of the capacity 
  to mitigate. Instead, climate change and sustainable development both simply 
  expand the number of objectives against which these costs need to be measured. 
</p>
<p>The expansion of IPCC&#146;s scope in this WGIII report complements that of 
  WGII (IPCC, 2001), which addresses the impacts of continued atmospheric accumulation 
  of GHGs and the adaptive capacity of countries to adjust to the consequences 
  of that accumulation. The analogous concept of mitigative capacity (Yohe, in 
  press) is offered in <a href="064.htm">Section 1.5 </a>as one tool with which 
  policymakers and researchers alike might integrate insights drawn from the domains 
  of cost-effectiveness, equity, and sustainability into their understanding of 
  mitigation. Drawing attention to concepts like mitigative capacity also allows 
  the reader to approach the complexity of mitigation within a framework that 
  mirrors the emphasis placed on adaptive capacity by the TAR WGII Report.</p>

<p>The expansion of the range and scope of IPCC policy analysis, just described, 
  can be understood as a gradual broadening of the types and extent of uncertainties 
  that analysts have been willing and able to address. A graphic representation 
  of this expansion of interest and capability (<a href="050.htm#fig11">Figure 
  1.1</a>) shows that the policy sciences have made significant advances since 
  IPCC FAR. This figure simply depicts different perspectives that have been employed 
  to examine climate policy issues and the stage at which they were incorporated 
  into the IPCC process. Progression through the IPCC assessments displayed in 
  <a href="050.htm#fig11">Figure 1.1</a> represents expansions in the scope of 
  climate policy analyses since 1980. There is no presumption that any particular 
  framework for analysis is most appropriate at any level. The important changes 
  are primarily in the types of questions being asked and the kinds of information 
  being sought. In practice, the literature has expanded to add new issues and 
  has subsumed rather than discarded the analyses of the initial issues. With 
  each assessment, IPCC has added to the necessary tool set without obviating 
  the need for the tools developed in the earlier assessments.</p>
<p>The first concern of policy analysis to be included in IPCC assessments is 
  labelled &#147;Cost-effectiveness&#148; in <a href="050.htm#fig11">Figure 1.1</a>. 
  It represents the field of conventional climate policy analysis that is well 
  represented in the First through to the Third Assessments. These analyses are 
  generally driven directly or indirectly by the question of what is the most 
  cost-effective amount of mitigation for the global economy starting from a particular 
  baseline GHG emissions scenario, and reflecting a specific set of socioeconomic 
  scenarios. Within this framework, important issues include measuring the performance 
  of various technologies and the removal of barriers (such as existing subsidies) 
  to the implementation of the candidate policies most likely to contribute to 
  emissions reductions. In a sense, the focus of such analysis is to identify 
  an efficient pathway through the interactions of mitigation policies and economic 
  development, in some cases conditioned by considerations of equity and sustainability, 
  but not primarily guided by them. At this level, IPCC policy analysis has almost 
  always taken the existing institutions and tastes of individuals as given; such 
  assumptions might be valid for a decade or two, but may become more questionable 
  over many decades.<a href="fn1.htm#1" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a> 
</p>
<p>By introducing the issue of equity, SAR (IPCC, 1996) broadened the IPCC policy 
  discourse; a process reflected by &#147;Equity&#148; in <a href="050.htm#fig11">Figure 
  1.1</a>. The impetus for this expansion in the scope of the discourse was to 
  include considerations not simply of the impacts of climate change and mitigation 
  policies on global welfare as a whole, but also of the effects of climate change 
  and mitigation policies on existing inequalities among and within nations. The 
  literature on equity and climate change has advanced considerably since SAR, 
  but there is no consensus on what constitutes fairness. Once equity issues were 
  introduced into the IPCC assessment agenda, though, they became important components 
  in defining the search for efficient emissions mitigation pathways. The considerable 
  literature that indicates how environmental policies could be hampered or even 
  blocked by those who considered them unfair became relevant (National Academy 
  of Engineering, 1986; Rayner and Cantor, 1987; Grubb, 1989; Weiss, 1989; Kasperson 
  and Dow, 1991). In light of these results, it became clear how and why any widespread 
  perception that a mitigation strategy is unfair would likely engender opposition 
  to that strategy, perhaps to the extent of rendering it non-optimal (or even 
  infeasible). Some cost-effectiveness analyses had, in fact, laid the groundwork 
  for applying this literature by demonstrating the sensitivity of some equity 
  measures to policy design, national perspective, and regional context. Indeed, 
  cost-effectiveness analyses had even highlighted similar sensitivities for other 
  measures of development and sustainability.</p>
<p>Throughout this evolution, though, the historical model of societies that industrialized 
  in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries served as the central notion of what 
  constitutes development in both the cost-effectiveness and equity perspectives. 
  According to some analysts (e.g., Simon and Kahn, 1984; Beckerman, 1996) this 
  path represents the best model for global prosperity. However, a growing parallel 
  literature recognizes the importance of diverse development pathways in achieving 
  an environmentally and socioeconomically sustainable world (see <a href="061.htm">Section 
  1.4</a>). This insight can serve as the basis of a third analytical perspective&#150;a 
  perspective represented in <a href="050.htm#fig11">Figure 1.1</a> by &#147;Global 
  Sustainability&#148;. As yet, however, analyses of such alternative development 
  pathways remain largely unrealized within the framework of IPCC. Still, the 
  first steps in this direction can be detected throughout this volume. <br>
  <br>
  The above description of three complementary perspectives on climate change 
  mitigation and the broad societal goals of development, equity, and sustainability 
  bears elaboration. The rest of this chapter can be seen as a triptych, in which 
  each section presents a particular perspective on climate change mitigation&#150;motivated 
  respectively by considerations of cost-effectiveness, equity, and sustainability. 
  However, we also describe how each of the perspectives has attempted to address 
  and incorporate concerns that lie beyond their initial starting points. For 
  example, <a href="051.htm">Section 1.2 </a>details the Cost-effectiveness perspective; 
  however, its two concluding sections, (<a href="054.htm">1.2.5</a> and <a href="055.htm#126">1.2.6</a>) 
  describe how this approach has addressed concerns of equity and sustainability. 
  Similarly, <a href="056.htm">Section 1.3</a> is entitled &#147;Equity and Sustainable 
  Development&#148; in recognition of the fact that writers examining the issue 
  of climate change from a vantage point of global equity have generally sought 
  to explore how developing countries could pursue their sustainable development 
  goals. In the penultimate sub-section (<a href="060.htm">1.3.4</a>) of this 
  section, we examine the concept of sustainable development and describe its 
  relationship to cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability. Finally, 
  the theme of <a href="061.htm">Section 1.4</a> is Global sustainability; and 
  its two main sub-sections (<a href="062.htm">1.4.2</a> and <a href="063.htm">1.4.3</a>) 
  discuss issues of resource efficiency (de-coupling growth from resource flows), 
  and values and norms that include issues of equity. </p>
<p>In other words, instead of forcing the literature that describes the relationship 
  between climate change mitigation and development, equity, and sustainability 
  into a single framework, we have tried to bring out both the commonalities and 
  differences between alternative approaches and analytical frameworks. All three 
  classes of analyses look at the relationship of climate change mitigation with 
  all three goals&#150;development, equity, and sustainability&#150;albeit in 
  different and often highly complementary ways. Nevertheless, they frame the 
  issues differently, focus on different sets of causal relationships, use different 
  tools of analysis, and often come to somewhat different conclusions. Accordingly, 
  they are likely to be useful to decision makers in different ways. </p>
<p>Assessing the climate challenge with a sustainable development perspective 
  immediately reveals that countries differ in ways that have dramatic implications 
  for baselines and the range of mitigation options that can be considered. Moreover, 
  although models centred on Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development 
  (OECD) countries may give helpful first-order insights into the efficacy of 
  global policy interventions, the underlying assumptions may make such models 
  less useful when the heterogeneity of nations is incorporated fully. Recognition 
  of this heterogeneity may lead to a different range of policy options than considered 
  likely thus far, and may ultimately feed back into policy design for Annex I 
  countries. Recognizing heterogeneity among countries reveals, in short, differences 
  in the capacities of different sectors, which may also enhance appreciation 
  of what can be done by non-state actors as well as governments to build their 
  mitigative capacity. The expansion of analytic perspectives also represents 
  the increasing complexity of issues selected for analytic focus. On the left-hand 
  side of <a href="050.htm#fig11">Figure 1.1</a>, complexity refers primarily 
  to the analytical challenges presented by individual technologies (such as fuel 
  cells or photovoltaics) or specific policy instruments (such as carbon taxes 
  or tradable emissions permits). Moving from left to right across the figure, 
  such complexities become compounded, first by interactions among technologies 
  and policy instruments, then among mitigation and adaptation issues, and, finally 
  among climate change issues narrowly defined and a wide range of environmental 
  and socioeconomic issues. Finally, linkages and interactions with policy objectives 
  for the development of the global economy come into the picture. </p>
<p>A major part of the complexity that must be dealt with in formulating climate 
  policies is the uncertainties about how the world and the climate system will 
  evolve without new policies, about what policies will be implemented now and 
  in the future, and about the efficacy of those policies. The economist Frank 
  Knight (1921) introduced a fundamental distinction between &#147;risk&#148; 
  and &#147;uncertainty&#148;, <a href="fn1.htm#2" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>2</sup></small></a> 
  whereby risk refers to cases for which the probable outcomes are predicted through 
  well-established theories and methods, and with reliable data (e.g., the radiative 
  forcing of a tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> or the efficiency of a gas turbine); and 
  uncertainty to situations in which theories and methods are widely accepted, 
  but the appropriate data are not available or are fragmentary, and probabilities 
  and outcomes can be assessed subjectively by relevant experts. In this situation, 
  formal decision-analytic tools can be quite useful, but only if carefully and 
  systematically applied (Savage, 1954; Raiffa, 1968; Howard, 1980, 1988: Howard 
  and Matheson, 1984). There is, however, a third state in the climate context, 
  which may be called decision making under deep uncertainty (sometimes also referred 
  to as &#147;secondary&#148; uncertainties; see Fischbeck, 1991). For deep uncertainty, 
  it is not possible to specify the behaviour of major components of a system 
  because of the absence of or contradictions in data, methods, and/or theory. 
  Decision-analytic methods can still be applied, but the process of eliciting 
  subjective probabilities is much more complicated. The experts must factor in 
  assessments about the likelihood of each of the alternative theories being correct, 
  on top of assessments of the probabilities for alternative parameter values 
  within the methods suggested by that theory. In addition, the experts need to 
  provide some estimate of the uncertainty in outcomes caused by factors not incorporated 
  into any existing theory. For example, there may be discontinuities in the response 
  of the climate or ecological systems that occur at as yet unrecognized thresholds.</p>
<p>Since they have different starting points and objectives, the three approaches 
  to climate policy analysis have exhibited somewhat different approaches to handling 
  uncertainty. Applications of the cost-effectiveness approach have generally 
  ignored uncertainty completely or stayed fairly close to the traditional decision 
  analysis approach, focusing on incorporating a limited number of subjectively 
  accessed probabilities on key uncertainties. Applications of the equity approach 
  have been focused on the risks climate change and climate change policies might 
  pose to the &#147;most vulnerable&#148; elements of the global population and 
  have generally employed sensitivity analyses to accomplish this objective. Studies 
  done from the sustainability perspective have more often than not focused on 
  the robustness of policies (and especially those designed to build climate mitigation 
  and adaptation possibilities) across wide ranges of values for uncertain inputs 
  and parameters.</p>
<p>The rest of this chapter elaborates each of the three analytic perspectives 
  shown in <a href="050.htm#fig11">Figure 1.1</a>. The motivation for this elaboration 
  is threefold. First, it is to help the reader situate each perspective in the 
  evolution of policy science as reflected in IPCC assessments. Second, it is 
  designed to situate the issue of GHG emissions mitigation in the context of 
  climate policy more broadly. Third, it seeks to locate climate policy in a broader 
  context of concerns about development, equity, and sustainability. However, 
  it must be emphasized that <a href="050.htm#fig11">Figure 1.1</a> does not represent 
  any sort of linear evolution in which one kind of analytic tool or policy focus 
  replaces a predecessor. Rather than a hierarchy of approaches, the evolution 
  of perspectives suggests a portfolio approach both to assessment and policy 
  choice. Just like a personal investment portfolio, a rational global climate 
  policy portfolio contains a flexible mix of diverse commitments consistent with 
  different development goals, and to protect against different contingencies 
  at various levels of uncertainty about the future.</p>
