<h4>2.5.2.3 Comparison of Quantified Stabilization Scenarios</h4>
<p>Based on the storylines, 76 stabilization scenarios were quantified as shown 
  in <a href="082.htm#tab26">Table 2.6</a>. The assessment of the post-SRES work 
  in this section is restricted to the analysis of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and 
  energy use in the different model runs. The detailed comparison of macroeconomic 
  costs of reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions costs is not dealt with here: <a href="319.htm">Chapter 
  8</a> addresses this aspect of stabilization.</p>
<p><a href="#fig213">Figure 2.13</a> shows the CO<sub>2</sub> emission trajectories 
  of the 76 post-SRES mitigation scenarios along with the ranges of SRES and other 
  published scenarios. Quantifications differ with respect to the baseline scenario 
  including assumed storyline, the stabilization target, and the model that was 
  used. As shown in <a href="#fig213">Figure 2.13</a>, the post-SRES scenarios 
  cover a very wide range of emission trajectories, but the range is relatively 
  below the SRES range, and they are apparently classified into groups according 
  to the different stabilization targets. The figure shows the WRE late-response 
  scenario and WGI early-action scenario for 550ppmv stabilization to compare 
  with post-SRES scenarios, and it shows that the post-SRES range covers a much 
  wider range than that between WRE and WGI.</p>

<p><a href="#fig214">Figure 2.14</a> shows the comparison of SRES and post-SRES 
  scenario ranges in total global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The post-SRES ranges 
  are estimated based on the selected scenarios quantified by SRES participants 
  in order to compare the formal SRES ranges in Nakicenovic <i>et al.</i> (2000). It 
  is shown clearly in the figure that concentration stabilization requires much 
  more reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions under development paths with high 
  emissions such as A1FI and A2 than under development paths such as B1 and B2. 
  These differences in reduction requirements result in selection of different 
  technology and/or policy measures and, as a consequence, different costs to 
  stabilize concentrations even at the same level. In the A1 scenario family, 
  with its different scenarios in technological development (A1B, A1FI, and A1T), 
  technological change is also a key component in bringing down the costs of mitigation 
  options and their contribution to the emissions reduction. The A1FI stabilization 
  scenarios, which are based on the highest baseline emissions, require much larger 
  emission reductions than the A1T stabilization scenarios. The role of technology 
  has been found to be crucial in the A1 scenario variants.</p>
<p>Morita <i>et al.</i> (2000a) compared all the stabilization variants in detail and 
  found several common characteristics among these scenarios. These findings are 
  as follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Comparing the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reductions from SRES baselines, 
    the models have many points in common, but there are also some clear differences. 
    All models show an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> reduction over time. This reflects 
    the strong constraint of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. There is 
    a considerable range in reductions among models in early years. However, most 
    models achieve a similar proportional reduction from the baseline over the 
    observation period. <br>
  <li> For achieving stabilization at 550ppmv, the highest reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> 
    emissions compared to the baseline are observed in the A2 family. B1 shows 
    the lowest reductions. CO<sub>2</sub> reduction at the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> 
    century ranges in A2 between 75% and 80%, A1B between 50% and 75%, B2 between 
    40% and 70%, and B1 between 5% and 40%. <br>
  <li> The target stabilization level also significantly affects the CO<sub>2</sub> 
    reduction, even when based on the same baseline scenario. In the 450ppmv stabilization 
    case, the reduction reaches 70% to 100%<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#13","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>14</sup></small></a> 
    of A1B baseline emissions at the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. <br>
  <li> Energy consumption reductions are more complicated among models. There 
    is no strong relationship between the level of energy consumption and the 
    stabilization level.<br>
  <li> Different baselines lead to different macroeconomic costs in order to reach 
    a stabilization target. In spite of the wide range among models, A2 would 
    be the most expensive case while B1 would require the lowest cost for stabilization 
    at 550ppmv. The GDP loss in B1 would be less than one-tenth that in the A1B 
    case, and less than one-twentieth that in the A2 case. <br>
  <li> The CO<sub>2</sub> reduction and macroeconomic costs are also significantly 
    affected by the target stabilization level, even when based on the same baseline 
    scenario. The economic cost for 450ppmv stabilization would be around three 
    times that for 550ppmv, and six to eight times that for 650ppmv. These relationships 
    can be observed at both the global and regional levels. <br>
  <li> Different stabilization targets also require different timing for the introduction 
    of reduction policies. The 450ppmv stabilization case requires drastic emission 
    reductions that occur earlier than under the 650ppmv case. Very rapid increases 
    in emission reduction over 20 to 30 years are also observed in the 450ppmv 
    stabilization case. 
</ul>
<p>In order to compare the scenarios in further detail, several indices were calculated 
  for this review. </p>
<p>First, a CO<sub>2</sub> reduction index was compared among stabilization levels 
  as well as among SRES worlds. This index is calculated by subtracting baseline 
  emissions from mitigation scenario emissions. In general, the lower the stabilization 
  level that is required, as well as the higher the level of baseline emissions 
  caused by the selected development path, the larger the CO<sub>2</sub> divergence 
  from the baseline that is needed in all the regions. However, it does not simply 
  follow from the larger divergence in emissions that there is an earlier divergence 
  from the baseline. </p>
<p>The impact on the timing of emission reduction of both the stabilization level 
  and the baseline level of emissions is further elaborated in <a href="#fig215">Figure 
  2.15</a>. This figure shows when the reduction in energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions in each stabilization scenario would reach 20% of baseline emissions. 
  This figure indicates that more stringent stabilization targets require earlier 
  emission reductions from baseline levels. Higher emission worlds such as A1F1 
  and A2 also require earlier reduction than lower emission worlds such as A1T 
  and B1.</p>
<p>A key policy question is what kind of emission reductions would be needed in 
  the medium term, after the commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (assuming 
  that it will be implemented). <a href="#fig216">Figure 2.16</a> shows the percent 
  reduction in energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Annex I countries from 
  1990 for the various stabilization cases. Since the first commitment period 
  of the Kyoto Protocol ends in 2012, this can give some indication of the extent 
  to which emission reduction commitments after 2012 would be needed to achieve 
  the various stabilization levels. It should be noted that about two thirds of 
  the scenarios assume that developing countries have already diverged from their 
  baseline emission trajectories in 2020. Another point is that the post-SRES 
  scenarios were not developed specifically to include the Kyoto targets, so there 
  is a range of Annex I emission reductions (from 1990 levels) in 2010, 2020 and 
  2030. The mid-course scenarios are indicated in <a href="#fig216">Figure 2.16</a> 
  as the range between the 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles of 
  the frequency distribution of the scenarios. </p>
<p><a href="#fig213">Figure 2.16</a> shows that:<br>
<ul>
  <li> In the 450ppmv stabilization scenarios, the middle range (between the 25<sup>th</sup> 
    and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles) of Annex I emissions in 2010 lies between 
    the Kyoto target and a 19% reduction from 1990 levels. This range increases 
    after 2010, as does the decrease in Annex I emissions that would be needed 
    to achieve stabilization at 450 ppmv. The percent reduction from 1990 levels 
    in the middle range of scenarios is 13%&#150;34% in 2020 and 11%&#150;52% 
    in 2030;<br>
  <li> In the 550ppmv stabilization scenarios, the middle range of Annex I emissions 
    in 2010 is around the Kyoto target (from an 11% decrease to a 5% increase 
    from 1990 levels); in 2020, the middle range of emissions lies between a 17% 
    decrease and an 8% increase from 1990 levels; and in 2030, it lies between 
    an 18% decrease and an 8% increase from 1990 levels. The average level of 
    emissions slightly decreases after 2010; and<br>
  <li> The 650 or 750ppmv stabilization scenarios show similar changes in emission 
    levels in 2010 compared to 1990, and few of them show any additional reduction 
    in Annex I emissions after 2010. The middle range of emissions lies between 
    an increase of 1%&#150;17% from 1990 levels in 2020, and an increase of 4%&#150;21% 
    from 1990 levels in 2030. 
</ul>
<p>This suggests that achievement of stabilization at 450ppmv will require emissions 
  reductions in Annex I countries by 2020 that go significantly beyond their Kyoto 
  Protocol commitments for 2008 to 2012.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#15","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>15</sup></small></a> 
  It also suggests that it would not be necessary to go much beyond the Kyoto 
  commitments for Annex I countries (assuming as indicated that developing countries 
  diverge from their baselines by 2020) to achieve stabilization at 550ppmv or 
  higher. However, it should be recognized that several scenarios do indicate 
  the need for significant emission reductions by 2020 in order to achieve these 
  stabilization levels. These findings should be interpreted in light of the facts 
  that CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are assumed to reach one of the alternative 
  fixed target levels in the year 2150, and unlike &#147;emission corridor&#148; 
  analyses, these scenarios do not introduce other conditions such as a constraint 
  on the rate of temperature increase. </p>
<p>Another important policy question concerns the participation of developing 
  countries in emission mitigation. As a first step in addressing this question, 
  the post-SRES scenarios were evaluated according to when per capita CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions in Annex I countries would fall below per capita emissions in non-Annex 
  I countries, assuming that all CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction necessary for 
  stabilization would occur in Annex I countries and that non-Annex I countries 
  would emit CO<sub>2</sub> without any controls. This hypothetical assumption 
  permits the analysis of one of the determinants of when non-Annex I emissions 
  might begin to diverge from baseline levels. The results are shown in <a href="#fig217">Figure 
  2.17</a> for each stabilization level and for three groups of SRES baselines. 
</p>
<p><a href="#fig217">Figure 2.17</a> shows that:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Assuming that all the CO<sub>2</sub> reductions for concentration stabilization 
    are undertaken in Annex I countries, most of the post-SRES scenarios indicate 
    that per capita Annex I emissions would fall below per capita non-Annex I 
    emissions in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. This situation occurs before 2050 
    in two-thirds of the scenarios. Only in the A1T or B1 worlds would per capita 
    CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in developing countries remain below those of developed 
    countries in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. <br>
  <li> These timings are significantly affected by the time series of emission 
    reductions in the scenarios, and consequently they diverge in the scenarios. 
    However, comparison within individual models suggests that the lower the stabilization 
    level, the earlier that Annex I per capita emissions fall below non-Annex 
    I per capita emissions. Stabilization scenarios based on higher emission worlds 
    such as A1FI and A2 also tend to show earlier timing for Annex I to fall below 
    non-Annex I per capita emissions compared to scenarios based on the lower 
    emission worlds of B1 or A1T. This suggests that the stabilization target 
    and the baseline emission level are both important determinants of the timing 
    when developing countries&#146; emissions might need to diverge from their 
    baseline emissions. 
</ul>
<p>In order to assess priority setting in energy intensity reduction or in carbon 
  intensity reduction, a &#147;response index&#148; was calculated for all stabilization 
  variants of post-SRES scenarios for the years 2020, 2050, and 2100, as shown 
  in <a href="#fig218">Figure 2.18</a>. This index relates the impact on CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emission reduction of switching towards low-carbon or carbon free energy to 
  the impact of energy intensity reduction. The response index is the ratio of 
  the change in carbon intensity to the change in primary energy intensity<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#16","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>16</sup></small></a>. 
</p>
<p>When energy intensity reduction is relatively larger than carbon intensity 
  reduction, the index shows more than 1.0, and less than 1.0 in the opposite 
  case.</p>
<p>It is clear from <a href="#fig218">Figure 2.18</a> that the priority of response 
  to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would change over time. Energy intensity 
  reduction would be relatively larger than carbon intensity reduction in the 
  beginning of 21<sup>st</sup> century, but these would be of equal weight by 
  the middle of the century. The impact of energy intensity reduction would be 
  saturated towards the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and the use of low-carbon 
  or carbon-free energy sources would become relatively much larger. This pattern 
  is generally consistent across the stabilization levels. The lower the stabilization 
  target, the higher the relative importance of energy intensity reduction in 
  the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and the higher the relative importance 
  of low-carbon or carbon free energy towards the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>These trends are important, but it is necessary at the same time to understand 
  the model assumptions behind them. Most of the models do not accommodate very 
  well structural and consumption-pattern-related efficiency measures (e.g., advanced 
  dematerialization, major structural change, and changes in consumption patterns 
  and lifestyles). A few cases which incorporate drastic changes in social structure 
  (e.g., some of the scenarios based on AIM and WorldScan) give relatively high 
  priority to energy efficiency improvement even in the latter half of 21<sup>st</sup> 
  century. </p>
<p>A per capita final energy index was calculated in order to analyze equity between 
  North and South. Since one of the weak points of quantified scenario analysis 
  concerns equity or &#147;burden sharing&#148;, the comparison of this kind of 
  index is very important. Even though the per capita income is the most popular 
  index to analyze equity, this index was not estimated by all the modelling teams. 
  Therefore, final energy consumption per person in each region was adopted as 
  an appropriate index for the equity analysis, because this index is closely 
  related to per capita economic welfare. <a href="#fig219">Figure 2.19</a> shows 
  this index (in GJ/capita) among the OECD, EFSU, ASIA and ALM regions<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#17","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>17</sup></small></a> 
  for all post-SRES and SRES variants over the period 1990 to 2100.</p>
<p>As shown in this figure, some interesting trends can be observed: <br>
<ul>
  <li> In the development-emphasized worlds (A1B and A2) climate policy would 
    reduce per capita final energy in both the Annex I and non-Annex I countries, 
    while in the environment-emphasized worlds (B1 and B2) climate policy would 
    have little effect on energy use. These impacts would slightly improve equity 
    in per capita final energy use between the Annex I and non-Annex I countries, 
    because the reduction in energy use caused by climate policies would be larger 
    in Annex I than in non-Annex I.<br>
  <li> However, the impact of climate policies on equity in per capita final energy 
    use would be much smaller than that of the future development path. The differences 
    among the various SRES baseline conditions have the largest impact upon whether 
    per capita energy use values converge between Annex I and non-Annex I countries, 
    with the highest degree of convergence occurring in the A1B and B1 worlds. 
    This can be seen in <a href="#fig219">Figure 2.19</a> by comparing the (smaller) 
    change in energy use between regions within each of the four columns (i.e., 
    between the baseline and the 55ppmv stabilization scenario for each world) 
    with the (much larger) change between regions across each of the two rows 
    (i.e., across the baseline or across the 550ppmv stabilization scenario). 
</ul>
<p>Though the analyses described above mainly focus on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  from energy consumption, it is also important to consider non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions as well as non-energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. However, very 
  few scenarios that include these emissions have been quantified and therefore 
  it was not possible to include this additional review in this report. Some of 
  the nine modelling approaches used here do include other radiatively active 
  gases. However, the mitigation and/or stabilization scenarios include explicit 
  limitations only on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and hence the reductions in other 
  gases are indirect results (or ancillary benefits) of the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction 
  measures.</p>
