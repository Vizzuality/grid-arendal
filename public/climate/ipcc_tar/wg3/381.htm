<p><i>Linkages to National and Local Sustainable Development Choices</i></p>
<p>Government structures involved in the decision-making process vary considerably 
  among countries. Institutional articulation remains one of the critical factors 
  affecting the consolidation of an effective decision-making process related 
  to sustainable development. Even if rules and regulations exist to assign competence, 
  tasks, and responsibilities among the institutions involved, a considerable 
  gap exists between what might be desirable and what, for the most part, is practised. 
  In this context, policies related to sustainable development are no longer seen 
  as a hierarchical, government-controlled chain of commands, but rather as an 
  open process in which the principles of &#147;good governance&#148;&#150;transparency, 
  participation, pluralism, and accountability&#150;become the key elements of 
  the decision-making process.</p>
<p>A critical requirement of sustainable development is the capacity to design 
  policy measures that exploit potential synergies between national economic growth 
  objectives and environmentally focused policies without hindering development 
  and in accordance with national strategies. As also discussed in <a href="048.htm">Chapters 
  1</a> and <a href="068.htm">2</a>, climate change mitigation strategies offer 
  a clear example of co-ordinated and harmonized policies that take advantage 
  of the synergies between the implementation of mitigation options and broader 
  objectives. The potential linkages between climate change mitigation issues 
  and economic and social aspects have also brought an important shift in the 
  focus of mitigation analysis literature. The three perspectives introduced in 
  <a href="048.htm">Chapter 1</a> (cost-effectiveness, equity and sustainability) 
  illustrate this shift and broaden the array of options, for example by including 
  options for institutional and behavioural changes. From being confined to project-by-project 
  or sector-based approaches, analyses and studies are increasingly concerned 
  with the use of broader policy issues as mechanisms to reduce GHG emissions. 
  Thus the alternative energy paths of low carbon futures in developing countries 
  can be compatible with national objectives. Although environmental concerns, 
  and climate change issues in particular, were not explicitly addressed by macroeconomic 
  and sectoral policies, analyzed country cases show clear synergies between reform 
  policies and environmental improvements. It is also important to underline that 
  for the elements that make up policies at different levels to operate in a mutually 
  reinforcing manner, the creation of appropriate communication and information 
  channels should be given special attention.</p>
<p>The private sector has played an important role in the development and transfer 
  of energy efficiency technologies, which reduce the emission of GHGs, and it 
  is becoming increasingly active in developing and transferring renewable energy 
  technologies. Large enterprises can establish research and development (R&amp;D) 
  institutions on their own or jointly with other research centres to provide 
  support to technological innovation and the integration of production and research. 
  On the supply side, the government can play an important role in R&amp;D and 
  creating an enabling environment for technology transfer. While introducing 
  technologies to mitigate and adapt to climate change, the developing countries 
  should consider that the introduction of such technology could generate economic 
  benefits and promote sustainable development. In many cases of technology transfer, 
  much attention was paid to the introduction of technologies and a high cost 
  was paid to procure expensive technological facilities, but less effort was 
  applied to the digestion, absorption, and innovation of the introduced technologies. 
  Information can play a guiding role in technology transfer. To enable sound 
  decision-making, the up-to-date information on the current status of technology 
  research and development, the technical and economic evaluation of technologies, 
  and the sources of technologies should be available.</p>
<p><b>Key Policy-relevant Scientific Questions</b></p>
<p>Answers to policy-relevant scientific questions need to draw on the vast material 
  presented in this volume. These questions are concerned with the best possible 
  current action with a view to a huge array of possible futures. Decisions need 
  to be made regarding the short-term balance of various types of actions (mitigation, 
  adaptation, information acquisition), their timing (in absolute terms and relative 
  to each other), their location (of mainly mitigation activities), the character 
  and content of international agreements, and the mode and broader policy context 
  of implementation.</p>
<p>Striking the appropriate balance between mitigation and adaptation will be 
  a tedious process. The need for, extent, and costs of adaptation measures in 
  any region will be determined by the magnitude and nature of the regional climate 
  change driven by shifts in global climate. How global climate change unfolds 
  will be determined by the total amount of GHG emissions that, in turn, reflects 
  nations&#146; willingness to undertake mitigation measures. Balancing mitigation 
  and adaptation efforts largely depends on how mitigation costs are related to 
  net damages (primary or gross damage minus damage averted through adaptation 
  plus costs of adaptation). Both mitigation costs and net damages, in turn, depend 
  on some crucial baseline assumptions: economic development and baseline emissions 
  largely determine emission reduction costs, while development and institutions 
  influence vulnerability and adaptive capacity.</p>
<p>Options to mitigate climate change include actual emission reductions and CO<sub>2</sub> 
  sequestration, investments in developing technologies that will make future 
  reductions cheap relative to their current costs, institutional and regulatory 
  changes to modify current decisions that distort in favour of GHG-emitting action, 
  and others. Their relative weight in an optimal near-term portfolio of mitigation 
  actions crucially depends on the assumptions behind the various mitigation-cost 
  estimates and about the preconditions and future availability of inexpensive 
  technologies. Estimates of costs of drastic near-term reductions tend to be 
  high, but the proper way to encourage technological development remains heavily 
  debated.</p>
<p>In principle, costs of near-term emission reductions could be reduced by using 
  international flexibility mechanisms to realize reductions where they are least 
  expensive. While there is a broad agreement on the cost-reducing effect of international 
  flexibility mechanisms, there are concerns about their implications for incentives 
  to technological development as well as about the political (domestic and international) 
  and practical pitfalls of their implementation. In addition to costs, climate 
  change impacts and mitigation efforts raise a whole array of equity issues. 
</p>
<p>Much of the debate about climate change mitigation revolves around the broader 
  issue of development and the unequal distribution of wealth among countries 
  of the world. Views diverge widely. Is climate change an opportunity to solve 
  the problems of sustainable development and global distribution of wealth? Or 
  would broadening the scope of the already complex and controversial issue of 
  climate change run the risk of neither solving the climate problem nor improving 
  prospects for sustainable development? This reports takes the view that by taking 
  into account the broader perspective of sustainable development the portfolio 
  of mitigation policies is enhanced. A central issue in linking development and 
  climate concerns is technological transfer that could help less-developed countries 
  speed-up their development and control GHG emissions at relatively low costs. 
  Opportunities are ample, but barriers are significant also.</p>
