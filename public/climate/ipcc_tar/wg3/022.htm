<h3><a name="335"></a> 3.3.5 The Main Mitigation Options in the Waste Management 
  Sector </h3>
There has been increased utilization of CH<sub>4</sub> from landfills and from 
coal beds. The use of landfill gas for heat and electric power is also growing 
because of policy mandates in countries like Germany, Switzerland, the EU, and 
USA. Recovery costs are negative for half of landfill CH<sub>4</sub>. Requiring 
product life management in Germany has been extended from packaging to vehicles 
and electronics goods. If everyone in the USA increased per capita recycling rates 
from the national average to the per capita recycling rate achieved in Seattle, 
Washington, the result would be a reduction of 4% of total US GHG emissions. Debate 
is taking place over whether the greater reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions 
occurs through paper and fibre recycling or by utilizing waste paper as a biofuel 
in waste-to-energy facilities. Both options are better than landfilling in terms 
of GHG emissions. In several developed countries, and especially in Europe and 
Japan, waste-to-energy facilities have become more efficient with lower air pollution 
emissions.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="336"></a>3.3.6 The Main Mitigation Options in the Energy Supply Sector</h3>
<p>Fossil fuels continue to dominate heat and electric power production. Electricity 
  generation accounts for 2,100MtC/yr or 37.5% of global carbon emissions<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>10</a></sup></small>. 
  Baseline scenarios without carbon emission policies anticipate emissions of 
  3,500 and 4,000MtCeq for 2010 and 2020, respectively. In the power sector, low-cost 
  combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) with conversion efficiencies approaching 
  60% for the latest model have become the dominant option for new electric power 
  plants wherever adequate natural gas supply and infrastructure are available. 
  Advanced coal technologies based on integrated gasification combined cycle or 
  supercritical (IGCCS) designs potentially have the capability of reducing emissions 
  at modest cost through higher efficiencies. Deregulation of the electric power 
  sector is currently a major driver of technological choice. Utilization of distributed 
  industrial and commercial combined heat and power (CHP) systems to meet space 
  heating and manufacturing needs could achieve substantial emission reductions. 
  The further implications of the restructuring of the electric utility industry 
  in many developed and developing countries for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are 
  uncertain at this time, although there is a growing interest in distributed 
  power supply systems based on renewable energy sources and also using fuel cells, 
  micro-turbines and Stirling engines. </p>
<p>The nuclear power industry has managed to increase significantly the capacity 
  factor at existing facilities, which improved their economics sufficiently that 
  extension of facility life has become cost effective. But other than in Asia, 
  relatively few new plants are being proposed or built. Efforts to develop intrinsically 
  safe and less expensive nuclear reactors are proceeding with the goal of lowering 
  socio-economic barriers and reducing public concern about safety, nuclear waste 
  storage, and proliferation. Except for a few large projects in India and China, 
  construction of new hydropower projects has also slowed because of few available 
  major sites, sometimes-high costs, and local environmental and social concerns. 
  Another development is the rapid growth of wind turbines, whose annual growth 
  rate has exceeded 25% per year, and by 2000 exceeded 13GW of installed capacity. 
  Other renewables, including solar and biomass, continue to grow as costs decline, 
  but total contributions from non-hydro renewable sources remain below 2% globally. 
  Fuel cells have the potential to provide highly efficient combined sources of 
  electricity and heat as power densities increase and costs continue to drop. 
  By 2010, co-firing of coal with biomass, gasification of fuel wood, more efficient 
  photovoltaics, off-shore wind farms, and ethanol-based biofuels are some of 
  the technologies that are capable of penetrating the market. Their market share 
  is expected to increase by 2020 as the learning curve reduces costs and capital 
  stock of existing generation plants is replaced. </p>
<p>Physical removal and storage of CO<sub>2</sub> is potentially a more viable 
  option than at the time of the SAR. The use of coal or biomass as a source of 
  hydrogen with storage of the waste CO<sub>2</sub> represents a possible step 
  to the hydrogen economy. CO<sub>2</sub> has been stored in an aquifer, and the 
  integrity of storage is being monitored. However, long-term storage is still 
  in the process of being demonstrated for that particular reservoir. Research 
  is also needed to determine any adverse and/or beneficial environmental impacts 
  and public health risks of uncontrolled release of the various storage options. 
  Pilot CO<sub>2</sub> capture and storage facilities are expected to be operational 
  by 2010, and may be capable of making major contributions to mitigation by 2020. 
  Along with biological sequestration, physical removal and storage might complement 
  current efforts at improving efficiency, fuel switching, and the development 
  of renewables, but must be able to compete economically with them.</p>
<p>The report considers the potential for mitigation technologies in this sector 
  to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to 2020 from new power plants. CCGTs are 
  expected to be the largest provider of new capacity between now and 2020 worldwide, 
  and will be a strong competitor to displace new coal-fired power stations where 
  additional gas supplies can be made available. Nuclear power has the potential 
  to reduce emissions if it becomes politically acceptable, as it can replace 
  both coal and gas for electricity production. Biomass, based mainly on wastes 
  and agricultural and forestry by-products, and wind power are also potentially 
  capable of making major contributions by 2020. Hydropower is an established 
  technology and further opportunities exist beyond those anticipated to contribute 
  to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions. Finally, while costs of solar 
  power are expected to decline substantially, it is likely to remain an expensive 
  option by 2020 for central power generation, but it is likely to make increased 
  contributions in niche markets and off-grid generation. The best mitigation 
  option is likely to be dependent on local circumstances, and a combination of 
  these technologies has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 350-700MtC 
  by 2020 compared to projected emissions of around 4,00MtC from this sector.<br>

<h3><a name="337"></a>3.3.7 The Main Mitigation Options for Hydrofluoro-carbons 
  and Perfluorocarbons</h3>
<p>HFC and, to a lesser extent, PFC use has grown as these chemicals replaced 
  about 8% of the projected use of CFCs by weight in 1997; in the developed countries 
  the production of CFCs and other ozone depleting substances (ODSs) was halted 
  in 1996 to comply with the Montreal Protocol to protect the stratospheric ozone 
  layer. HCFCs have replaced an additional 12% of CFCs. The remaining 80% have 
  been eliminated through controlling emissions, specific use reductions, or alternative 
  technologies and fluids including ammonia, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and 
  water, and not-in-kind technologies. The alternative chosen to replace CFCs 
  and other ODSs varies widely among the applications, which include refrigeration, 
  mobile and stationary air-conditioning, heat pumps, medical and other aerosol 
  delivery systems, fire suppression, and solvents. Simultaneously considering 
  energy efficiency with ozone layer protection is important, especially in the 
  context of developing countries, where markets have just begun to develop and 
  are expected to grow at a fast rate.</p>
<p>Based on current trends and assuming no new uses outside the ODS substitution 
  area, HFC production is projected to be 370 kt or 170MtCeq/yr by 2010, while 
  PFC production is expected to be less than 12MtCeq/yr. For the year 2010, annual 
  emissions are more difficult to estimate. The largest emissions are likely to 
  be associated with mobile air conditioning followed by commercial refrigeration 
  and stationary air conditioning. HFC use in foam blowing is currently low, but 
  if HFCs replaces a substantial part of the HCFCs used here, their use is projected 
  to reach 30MtCeq/yr by 2010, with emissions in the order of 5-10MtCeq/yr.</p>
