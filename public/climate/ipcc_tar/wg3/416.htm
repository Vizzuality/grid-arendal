<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>Among the four combinations, so far economic analysis of consumption has been 
  based mainly on only one, private material goods. Since marginal satisfaction 
  with these is decreasing, the neglected combinations have been reconsidered 
  recently (Scherhorn, 1997). This is particularly relevant with respect to climate 
  change, because immaterial and common goods (irrespective of their material 
  basis) are or stimulate social activities that promote the integrity of society. 
  They either foster the natural environment or endanger it much less than private 
  and material goods generally do in terms of production, consumption, and waste 
  management. Material goods are not an end in themselves, so that their real 
  utility is different from their material reality. Politically, public education 
  in consumer&#146;s behaviour can promote the awareness that identities can be 
  expressed by a broader plurality of goods than just material and private goods.</p>
<p><i>New deals in collective action</i><br>
  Climate is a common public good and the debate as to what extent &#147;commons&#148; 
  can be appreciated in market-based economies is ongoing. Much of the discussion 
  originally derives from Olson&#146;s (1965) argument that if people were rational 
  egoists in the sense of liberal economics, individual rationality must lead 
  to collective irrationality in large informal groups, because free riders could 
  not be excluded. As non-irrational collective actions exist, human behaviour 
  cannot only be motivated by rational egoism, the problem posed by Olson&#146;s 
  analysis was to identify these other motivations. Ud&eacute;hn (1993) summarized 
  the subsequent discussion comprehensively. The main outcome confirms that human 
  co-operation generally cannot be explained economically, but only by taking 
  into account social or personal commitments. Sen (1976/77, 1985) noted that 
  such commitments can replace economic &#147;rationality&#148;, or utility maximization. 
  He also argued, that commitments are related to a person&#146;s &#147;identity&#148; 
  (discussed above as the key to lifestyles). These identities, however, are not 
  fixed once and for all but develop through social intercourse. Correspondingly, 
  one of the most consistent results of the debate on collective action is that 
  &#147;co-operation increases dramatically if people are allowed to communicate 
  before being subjected to a social dilemma&#148; (Ud&eacute;hn, 1993; see Dawes, 
  1980; Orbell <i>et al</i>., 1984; van de Kragt <i>et al</i>., 1986). This may be expected 
  in market behaviour as well, so that environmental commitments can overcome 
  price incentives. By co-operation in the common interest there is also &#147;reason 
  to believe that appeals to the full set of motivations and behaviours&#151;accompanied 
  by an analysis of bold options&#151;can encourage lifestyle decisions that reduce 
  pressures on the environment&#148; (Duchin, in press).</p>
<p><i>Environmental legislation</i><br>
  Democratic governments cannot go far beyond public consciousness in environmental 
  legislation. To the extent that people deliberately pay higher prices for environmentally 
  more benign goods, as has been discussed above, governments can increase this 
  threshold step by step.</p>
<p><i>Creative democracy</i><br>
  Better understanding (as the Olson debate has shown ) can lead to the perception 
  of common interests, but such understanding does not necessarily come about 
  by itself. Its promotion is rather an objective of &#147;creative democracy&#148; 
  (Burns and Ueberhorst, 1988). Generally, this is again a matter of education, 
  particularly of political education. &#147;Education and productive employment 
  ... would be worth while policy goals in relation to global climate change&#148; 
  (Douglas <i>et al</i>., 1998). Education implies formal and informal processes of creativity 
  as well as receptivity, so that not only schools and universities are to be 
  addressed here. For instance, in Germany most cities have their special Agenda 
  21 program, supported by citizens&#146; movements and by an Agenda 21 office 
  in local government. This stimulates learning by doing. The administration is 
  in charge here not simply to implement sustainability locally, but to promote 
  understanding as well as co-operation in the global interest of sustainability. 
  A broad public dialogue can also encourage public confidence in making changes 
  for the advantage of nature, the developing countries, and future generations. 
  For behavioural change, &#147;arguably the most important obstacle is the difficulty 
  of imagining new scripts and removing the obstacles to actually living them&#148; 
  (Duchin, in press). If that public dialogue, therefore, is mainly concerned 
  with such &#147;new scripts&#148;, even the discrepancy between environmental 
  consciousness and behaviour might finally disappear, so that people as consumers 
  would no longer lag behind themselves as citizens.</p>
<p><i>Research needs</i><br>
  Lifestyle research is neglected compared to technology research, even where 
  technological and lifestyle changes are linked. Particularly, nature-saving 
  lifestyles and the general process of self- and world-constitution through goods 
  are enormously understudied (see McCracken, 1988).</p>
