<h3><a name="441"></a>4.4.1 Environmental Costs and Ancillary Benefits in Forests</h3>
<p>Forests serve many environmental functions aside from carbon mitigation. Natural 
  forests with various stages of stand development, including old-growth forests 
  with snags and fallen logs, provide diverse habitats necessary for biodiversity 
  (Harris, 1984; Franklin and Spies, 1991). Stopping or slowing deforestation 
  and forest degradation, therefore, not only maintains carbon stocks but also 
  preserves biodiversity, as shown by studies in Belize (EPA/USIJI, 1998) and 
  Paraguay (Dixon <i>et al</i>., 1993). </p>
<p>Although plantations usually have lower biodiversity than natural forests (Yoshida, 
  1983: Kurz <i>et al</i>., 1997; Frumhoff and Losos, 1998), they can reduce pressure 
  on natural forests, leaving greater areas to provide for biodiversity and other 
  environmental services (Sedjo and Botkin, 1997). Plantations can negatively 
  affect biodiversity if they replace biologically rich native grassland or wetland 
  habitat, but non-permanent plantations of exotic or native species can be designed 
  to enhance biodiversity by stimulating restoration of natural forests (Keenan 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997; Lugo, 1997; Parrotta <i>et al</i>., 1997a, 1997b). Measures to promote 
  biodiversity of intensively managed plantations include the adoption of longer 
  rotation times, reduced or eliminated clearing of understory vegetation, use 
  of native tree species, and reduced chemical inputs (Allen <i>et al</i>., 1995; Da 
  Silva Jr <i>et al</i>., 1995; Fujimori, 1997).</p>
<p>Preserving forests conserves water resources and prevents flooding. For example, 
  the flood damage in Central America following hurricane Mitch was apparently 
  enhanced by loss of forest cover. By reducing runoff, forests control erosion 
  and salinity. Consequently, maintaining forest cover can reduce siltation of 
  rivers, protecting fisheries and investment in hydroelectric power facilities 
  (Chomitz and Kumari, 1996).</p>
<p>Afforestation and reforestation, like forest protection, may also have beneficial 
  hydrological effects. After afforestation in wet areas, the amount of direct 
  runoff initially decreases rapidly, then gradually becomes constant, and baseflow 
  increases slowly as stand age increases towards a mature stage (Kobayashi, 1987; 
  Fukushima, 1987), suggesting that reforestation and afforestation help reduce 
  flooding and enhance water conservation. In water-limited areas, afforestation, 
  especially plantations of species with high water demand, can cause significant 
  reduction of streamflow, affecting inhabitants in the basin (Le Maitre and Versfeld, 
  1997). The hydrological benefits of afforestation may need to be evaluated site 
  by site.</p>
<p>Forest protection may, however, have negative social effects, such as displacement 
  of local populations, reduced income, and reduced flow of subsistence products 
  from forests. Conflicts between protection of natural ecosystems and their other 
  functions, such as production of food, fuelwood, and roundwood, can be minimized 
  by appropriate land use on the landscape (Boyce, 1995; Forman, 1995) and appropriate 
  stand management.</p>
<p>In arid and semi-arid regions, where deforestation is advancing (Kharin, 1996) 
  and leading to carbon loss (Duan <i>et al</i>., 1995), restoring forests by afforestation 
  and proper management of existing secondary forests can help combat desertification 
  (Cony, 1995; Kuliev, 1996). Afforestation of desertified lands may be limited, 
  however, by costs and insufficient knowledge of ecology, genetics, and physiology 
  (Cony, 1995). In relatively arid regions, fuelwood plantations may reduce pressure 
  on natural woodlands, thereby retarding deforestation (Kanowski <i>et al</i>., 1992).</p>
<p>Agroforestry can both sequester carbon and produce a range of economic, environmental, 
  and socioeconomic benefits. For example, trees in agroforestry farms improve 
  soil fertility through control of erosion, maintenance of soil organic matter 
  and physical properties, increased N, extraction of nutrients from deep soil 
  horizons, and promotion of more closed nutrient cycling (Young, 1997). Thus, 
  agroforestry systems improve and conserve soil properties (Nair, 1989; MacDicken 
  and Vergara, 1990; Wang and Feng, 1995). Examples of mitigation projects that 
  promote soil conservation through agroforestry include the AES Thames Guatemala 
  project, and the Profator project in Ecuador (Dixon <i>et al</i>., 1993; FACE Foundation, 
  1997).</p>
<p>We note that decisions to protect or enlarge forest cover on a large scale 
  could also have secondary climate consequences through their feedbacks on the 
  earth&#146;s albedo, the hydrological cycle, cloud cover, and the effect of 
  surface roughness on air movements (see, for example, Pielke and Avissar, 1990; 
  Nobre <i>et al</i>., 1991; Garratt, 1993). Analyses by Bonan and Shugart (1992) suggest 
  that large-scale changes in vegetative cover in the boreal zone may be especially 
  important, with potentially global-scale impacts. In the boreal zone the albedo 
  contrast between forested and unforested land during the winter is particularly 
  large (differences as large as 40%). Indications are that the nature, magnitude, 
  and even direction of climate changes driven by changes in surface vegetative 
  cover will depend on the nature, location, hydrological setting, etc. of the 
  vegetative change. </p>
