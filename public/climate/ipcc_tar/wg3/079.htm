<p>Of the 124 global futures scenarios in the database, 35 provide some kind of 
  projection of future GHG (usually CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions. These projections 
  range from narrative descriptions (e.g., &#147;emissions continue to rise&#148;) 
  to numerical estimates. <a href="#fig29">Figure 2.9</a> shows global carbon 
  dioxide emissions projections from the scenarios that provide numerical estimates.</p>
<p>Most (22) of these scenarios project increased emissions, but several (13) 
  foresee declining emissions. All but one of the latter scenarios are Sustainable 
  Development scenarios in which there is a concerted policy effort towards emission 
  reduction, innovation in energy development towards improved efficiency and 
  conservation, and/or alternatives to fossil fuels. The exception is a High-Tech 
  Optimist scenario in which energy efficiency technologies and a shift to low- 
  and non-fossil fuels bring about declining emissions. </p>
<p>The Sustainable Development scenarios that project declining emissions are 
  in general characterized by increased co-operation and political participation; 
  many assume that there is strong international agreement on the environment 
  and development in general and climate change in particular. There is improved 
  environmental quality and equity and, in several scenarios, increased material 
  affluence globally (although some scenarios indicate a decline in consumerism). 
  Population continues to grow but at slower rates and stabilizes at relatively 
  low levels. In most scenarios significant developments of energy efficiency, 
  energy conservation, and alternative energy technologies are key to emission 
  reduction; a number of scenarios assume a tax on fossil fuels. </p>
<p><a href="#tab24">Table 2.4</a> summarizes the apparent relationships between 
  emissions and scenario dimensions. It is important to note that there is considerable 
  variety among the scenarios; <a href="#tab24">Table 2.4</a> therefore shows 
  relationships that were in the majority, but not necessarily all, of the scenarios. 
  It should also be noted that the relationships shown in <a href="#tab24">Table 
  2.4</a> do not by themselves prove causation; they simply reflect what the majority 
  of scenarios with rising and falling GHG emissions, respectively, indicate for 
  each scenario dimension. </p>
What is clear from <a href="#tab24">Table 2.4</a> is that there are no strong 
patterns in the relationship between economic activity and GHG emissions. Growth 
in economic activity is compatible, across this set of scenarios, with both increasing 
and decreasing GHG emissions. In the latter case, mediating factors include increased 
energy efficiency, shifts to non-fossil energy sources, and/or shifts to a post-industrial 
(service-based) economy. Similarly, population growth is present in scenarios 
with rising emissions as well as scenarios with falling emissions, although in 
the latter group of scenarios, population tends to stabilize at relatively low 
levels, in many cases owing to increased prosperity, expanded provision of family 
planning, and improved rights and opportunities for women.<br>

<p>The major visible difference has to do with environmental impacts. As might 
  be expected, pollution and the risk of ecological collapse are generally high 
  in scenarios which show rising GHG emissions, and low in scenarios which show 
  falling GHG emissions. Water availability and biodiversity decline in the scenarios 
  with rising GHG emissions, and rise or stay the same in the scenarios with falling 
  GHG emissions. </p>
<p>On a different front, in the scenarios with rising GHG emissions, conflict 
  and security activity are generally high, while government intervention in the 
  economy and income equality (within nations) are generally low. The reverse 
  is true in the scenarios with falling GHG emissions, which also show improving 
  equity between North and South. This would be expected from the fact that all 
  but one of these scenarios are Sustainable Development scenarios.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 of the SRES discusses the relationships between GHG emissions and 
  a number of driving forces, including population, economic and social development 
  (including equity), and technology. What is clear from that discussion, which 
  is consistent with the evidence summarized in <a href="#tab24">Table 2.4</a>, 
  is that the impacts on GHG emissions of changes in these underlying driving 
  forces are complex. </p>
<p>These complex relationships suggest that the choice of future &#147;world&#148; 
  is more fundamental than the choice of a few driving forces in determining GHG 
  emissions. The wide range of emissions in the various SRES baseline scenarios 
  also demonstrates this point. Choices about DES are crucial, not just for the 
  underlying conditions which give rise to emissions, but also for the nature 
  and severity of climate change impacts, and the success of particular mitigation 
  and adaptation policies. This finding is consistent with the discussion in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  1</a>, which suggests the central importance of DES issues in any consideration 
  of climate change.</p>
<p>It is important therefore that emission scenarios consider qualitative aspects 
  that are potentially important for future GHG emissions and mitigation policies. 
  One way to do this is to link these scenarios with the broader global futures 
  scenarios. However, this will be difficult because there are few areas of overlap, 
  as a result of the very different natures of the two kinds of scenarios. Perhaps 
  a more fruitful way of incorporating qualitative dimensions into quantitative 
  scenarios, already pursued by the Global Scenarios Group and others, as well 
  as in the SRES, is to develop quantitative estimates of key variables based 
  on qualitative descriptions of future worlds.</p>
<a name="245"></a> 
<h3>2.4.5 Conclusions </h3>
<p>A survey of the global futures literature has yielded a number of insights 
  that are relevant to GHG emission scenarios and sustainable development. First, 
  a wide range of future conditions has been identified by futurists, ranging 
  from variants of sustainable development to collapse of social, economic, and 
  environmental systems. Since future values of the underlying socio-economic 
  drivers of emissions may vary widely, it is important that GHG emission scenarios 
  in particular, and climate change analysis in general, not limit themselves 
  to a narrow range of possible futures, but consider the implications for mitigation 
  of quite different sets of future conditions. In turn, climate policies should 
  be designed so that they are resilient against widely different future conditions.</p>
<p>Second, the global futures scenarios describe a wide range of worlds, from 
  pessimistic to optimistic, that are consistent with rising GHG emissions and 
  a smaller range of (generally optimistic) worlds that are consistent with falling 
  emissions. Scenarios that show falling emissions tend to show improved governance, 
  increased equity and political participation, reduced conflict, conditions supportive 
  of lower birth rates, and improved environmental quality. Scenarios with rising 
  emissions generally show reduced environmental quality and equity within nations 
  and increased conflict, and are more mixed with respect to governance and international 
  equity. Both types of scenarios generally indicate continued technological development. 
  The Sustainable Development scenarios suggest that sustainable development approaches 
  are feasible, and can lead to futures characterized by relatively low emissions. 
  A key implication is that sustainable development policies, taken generally, 
  can make a significant contribution to emission reduction. </p>
<p>Third, scenarios do not all show a positive relationship between emissions 
  and economic and population growth, as is commonly assumed (see also the discussion 
  of the Kaya identity in <a href="074.htm#2321">Section 2.3.2.1</a> of this chapter). 
  This is largely because, in the scenarios with declining emissions and rising 
  population and economic activity, policy, lifestyle choices, and technological 
  development act to reduce emissions through efficiency improvements, energy 
  conservation, shifts to alternative fuels, and shifts to post-industrial economic 
  structures. This suggests that different combinations of driving forces are 
  consistent with low emission scenarios, which agrees with the SRES findings. 
  The implication of this would seem to be that it is important to consider the 
  linkage between climate policy and other policies and conditions associated 
  with the choice of future paths in a general sense. In other words, low emission 
  futures are associated with a whole set of policies and actions that go beyond 
  the development of climate policy itself.</p>
<p>In general, the global futures scenarios provide more comprehensive coverage 
  of the issues relevant to sustainable development than the general mitigation 
  scenarios described in <a href="073.htm#23">section 2.3</a>. They therefore 
  represent an important complement to the quantitative emission scenarios. However, 
  there are significant difficulties involved in trying to connect the mainly 
  narrative-based scenarios discussed in this section with the more quantitatively 
  oriented scenarios discussed earlier. In this connection, the work of the Global 
  Scenarios Group, the SRES, and others in linking narrative scenarios addressing 
  social, environmental, and economic elements of sustainable development with 
  model &#147;quantifications&#148; appears to point the way to the type of work 
  needed to better assess the implications of GHG mitigation for sustainable development 
  and vice versa. <a href="080.htm#25">Section 2.5</a> below discusses the SRES 
  scenarios and process, as well as mitigation scenarios that were developed on 
  the basis of the SRES baseline scenarios.</p>
