<h4>7.2.2.4 Market Failures and External Cost </h4>
<p>The term external cost or externality is used to define the costs that arise 
  from any human activity when the agent responsible for the activity does not 
  take full account of the impacts on others of his or her actions. Equally, when 
  the impacts are positive and not accounted for in the actions of the agent responsible 
  they are referred to as external benefits. Consider first the following example 
  of external costs. Emissions of particulate pollution from a power station affect 
  the health of people in the vicinity, but this is not often considered, or is 
  given inadequate weight in private decision-making, as there is no market for 
  such impacts. Such a phenomenon is referred to as an externality, and the costs 
  it imposes are referred to as the external costs.</p>
<p>External costs are distinct from the costs that the emitters of the particulates 
  take into account when determining their outputs, costs such as the prices of 
  fuel, labour, transportation, and energy. Categories of costs that influence 
  an individual&#146;s decision-making are referred to as private costs. The total 
  cost to society is made up of both the external cost and the private cost, which 
  together are defined as social cost: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Social Cost = External Cost + Private Cost</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The private cost component is generally taken from the market prices of the 
  inputs. Thus, if a project involves an investment of US$5 million, as estimated 
  by the inputs of land, materials, labour and equipment, that figure is used 
  as the private cost. That may not be the full cost, however, as far as the estimation 
  of social cost is concerned. If, for example, the labour input is being paid 
  more than its value in alternative employment, the private cost is higher than 
  the social cost. Adjustments to private costs based on market prices to bring 
  them into line with social costs are referred to as shadow pricing. A fuller 
  discussion of shadow pricing is given in Ray (1984).</p>
<p>External costs typically arise when markets fail to provide a link between 
  the person who creates the &#147;externality&#148; and the person who is affected 
  by it, or more generally when property rights for the relevant resources are 
  not well defined. If such rights were defined, market forces and/or bargaining 
  arrangements would ensure that the benefits and costs of generating the external 
  effect balanced properly. The failure to take into account external costs, however, 
  may be a product not only of a lack of property rights, but also the result 
  of a lack of full information and non-zero transaction costs.<br>
