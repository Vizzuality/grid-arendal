<h3>5.1.2 Special Report on Technology Transfer &#150; Barriers and Opportunities 
</h3>
<p>This IPCC Special Report was prepared in response to a request made by the 
  UN Framework Convention on Climate Change through its Subsidiary Body for Scientific 
  and Technological Advice (SBSTA) to provide input on the issue of &#147;Development 
  and assessment of methodological and technological aspects of transfer of technology&#148;. 
  The focus of the report is on transfer of technology, and it describes actions 
  that governments and other stakeholders can undertake to enhance technology 
  transfer within and between countries. It emphasizes that governments have a 
  key role to play in initiating and facilitating technology transfer, either 
  directly or by creating an enabling environment for the private sector and community 
  involvement. </p>
<p>While the technology transfer process can be complex and intertwined, certain 
  stages can be identified. These include the identification of needs, choice 
  of technology, assessment of conditions of transfer, agreement, and implementation. 
  Evaluation and adjustment to local conditions, and replication are other important 
  stages.</p>
<p>Barriers to the transfer of ESTs arise at each stage of the process. These 
  vary according to the specific context from sector to sector and can manifest 
  themselves differently in developed and developing countries, and in EITs. These 
  barriers range from lack of information; insufficient human capabilities; political 
  and economic barriers, such as lack of capital, high transaction costs, lack 
  of full cost pricing, and trade and policy barriers; institutional and structural 
  barriers; lack of understanding of local needs; business limitations, such as 
  risk aversion in financial institutions; institutional limitations, such as 
  insufficient legal protection; and inadequate environmental codes and standards. 
</p>
<p>The report further notes that there is no preset answer to enhancing technology 
  transfer. The identification, analysis, and prioritization of barriers should 
  be country based, and actions should be tailored to overcome specific barriers, 
  interests, and influences of specific stakeholders in order to develop effective 
  policy tools.</p>
<p>The thrust of the technology transfer report is on the identification of actions 
  that governments may pursue to overcome barriers that slow or prevent the transfer 
  of technology either within or across countries. This chapter of the TAR (Third 
  Assessment Report) provides an in-depth discussion of the literature on barriers 
  and opportunities, and provides a framework for differentiating between different 
  types of potentials and barriers to technology penetration. The framework also 
  helps in identifying the role of research, development and demonstration phases, 
  and their linkage to the eventual market acceptance of technology. The chapter 
  also discusses the opportunities for technology penetration, but it limits the 
  discussion on policies and measures to sectoral interventions. A discussion 
  of the broader policies and measures is found in <a href="224.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>.</p>
