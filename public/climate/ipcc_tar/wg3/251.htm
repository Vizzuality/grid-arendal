<h3>6.3.4 Other Policies and Instruments </h3>
<h4><a name="6341"></a>6.3.4.1 Regulatory Instruments</h4>
<p>There are two ways to apply regulatory instruments internationally. One is 
  to establish uniform standards for various products and processes for adoption 
  by countries that participate in an international emission reduction agreement. 
  There are several reasons why establishing uniform international standards for 
  GHGs reduction is unlikely; for example, it is difficult to achieve agreement 
  on the appropriate standards by affected interest groups in participating countries, 
  and such an approach would limit the domestic policy choices of individual countries. 
  The second way is to adopt fixed national emission levels (non-tradable emission 
  quotas) for participating countries. These national emission limits can be considered 
  performance standards that each country must meet through domestic action. This 
  leads to inefficiency because marginal emission abatement costs differ among 
  countries (IPCC, 1996, p. 404).</p>
<h4><a name="6342"></a>6.3.4.2 International and Harmonized (Domestic) Carbon 
  Taxes</h4>
<p>An international carbon tax, payable to an international agency, or domestic 
  carbon taxes harmonized across countries, offer potentially cost-effective means 
  of obtaining CO<sub>2</sub> reductions (IPCC, 1996, 11.2.2.2).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#75","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>75</sup></small></a> 
  By associating a uniform price with carbon emissions in every country, only 
  reductions that cost less than the tax will be implemented, assuming that the 
  tax is implemented perfectly. To provide a common price signal in all countries, 
  the new carbon tax may need to be differentiated across countries to account 
  for existing domestic fuel taxes and revenue constraints (Hoel, 1993). Providing 
  a common price signal to all sources subject to the tax also requires that all 
  countries refrain from policies that directly or indirectly offset the tax (such 
  as subsidies or regulations).</p>
<p>The revenue raised by an international carbon tax must be redistributed or 
  used in an agreed manner. It is likely to be difficult to obtain an agreement 
  on the share of the revenue that each country should receive. Harmonized domestic 
  taxes avoid this difficulty by letting each country keep the revenue it collects. 
  In practice, it is difficult also to achieve agreement on minimum levels of 
  harmonized carbon and/or energy taxes high enough to impact carbon emissions 
  significantly. Political pressures to combine tax proposals with exemptions 
  for specific sectors contribute to this difficulty and, if accepted, reduce 
  the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax.</p>
<p>International or harmonized taxes provide greater certainty about the likely 
  costs of an emissions reduction programme, compared with a similarly designed 
  international emissions trading programme (Toman <i>et al</i>., 1999). This advantage 
  can also be obtained by a hybrid policy, consisting of domestic emissions trading 
  programmes coupled with a harmonized &#147;trigger price&#148;, at which countries 
  would sell additional permits domestically (McKibbin and Wilcoxen, 2000). The 
  hybrid policy sets an upper bound on the marginal cost of abatement (like a 
  carbon tax), but otherwise operates like an emissions trading programme. For 
  a discussion of the pros and cons of such a hybrid system, see <a href="235.htm">Sections 
  6.2.2.2</a> and <a href="237.htm">6.2.2.3</a>.</p>
<p>The two major concerns about international price-based policies are the emissions 
  levels, and the feasibility of international agreement:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first concern is that price-based policies (taxes or hybrid systems) 
    fail to guarantee particular emissions levels if it is not possible to adjust 
    the tax rate frequently to achieve emission reductions in accordance with 
    the set targets. If one assumes, for instance, that taxes are the only instrument 
    used to fulfil the Kyoto Protocol commitments, in practice they most likely 
    cannot guarantee that emissions commitments will be fulfilled either in the 
    aggregate and/or for individual countries.</li>
  <li>The second concern is that an international agreement involving international 
    or domestically harmonized taxes may be more difficult to negotiate than one 
    involving emissions quotas. Wiener (1998) argues that the voluntary assent 
    nature of international agreements means that nations must be made better 
    off to participate, unlike domestic policies for which individuals can be 
    coerced. While in theory international or domestically harmonized taxes can 
    be combined with side payments to compensate losers, in practice such side 
    payments are difficult to negotiate and tend to introduce dynamic inefficiencies 
    since individual firms (and countries) do not bear the full social cost of 
    their activities (Mestelman, 1982; Baumol and Oates, 1988; Kohn, 1992).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#76","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>76</sup></small></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Cooper (1998) takes the opposite position, arguing that taxes are the more 
  feasible international approach. He argues that because of their rising contribution 
  to global emissions, the participation of developing countries is essential 
  for the long-term success of a programme to stabilize GHG concentrations in 
  the atmosphere. He argues that it may be impossible to forge an agreement between 
  rich and poor countries on the allocation of future quotas. Instead, &#147;mutually 
  agreed-upon actions&#148;, such as nationally collected emission taxes, are 
  the logical alternative.</p>
