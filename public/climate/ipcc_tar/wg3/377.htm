<h2>9.5 Areas for Further Research<br>
</h2>
<p>The literature on sectoral economic costs and benefits is limited and additional 
  research would be beneficial in all areas. Specific issues identified in this 
  chapter (not in order of priority) include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Additional research on the impacts of climate change policies on the fossil 
    fuel industries is needed. Questions include: 
    <ul>
      <li>the apparent anomaly between studies indicating significant decreases 
        in the demand for oil in Annex B countries, and studies indicating significant 
        increases in the demand for transportation fuels, the major user of oil; 
      </li>
      <li>whether in the medium term (10 to 30 years) reserves of conventional 
        oil are limited, which would soften the impact of climate change policies, 
        or whether they are plentiful; and </li>
      <li>whether the demand for natural gas will decrease as a result of a general 
        decrease in the demand for fossil fuels, or increase, as a result of fuel 
        switching from higher carbon content fuels and growth in demand in non-Annex 
        B countries.,</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The impacts of climate change policies on the financial industries have 
    not been analyzed. IPCC (2001) details the potential impacts, positive and 
    negative, of climate change on the financial industries, but there appears 
    to be no literature evaluating the degree to which mitigation policies would 
    affect these impacts.</li>
  <li>The applicability of existing climate policies, and their impacts on the 
    aviation industry and the shipping industry have not been adequately studied. 
    Further analysis is needed to determine the efficiency, effectiveness, and 
    equity of various policy options, particularly involving taxation, on limiting 
    GHG emissions from aviation and shipping. This would include the difficulties 
    involved in changing the current treaty structure to allow for the taxation 
    of aviation fuel. The International Maritime Organization is studying GHG 
    emissions from shipping. The International Civil Aviation Organization is 
    currently analyzing policy options for aviation and is expected to complete 
    its evaluation by September, 2001.</li>
  <li>Further study would be helpful to determine the degree to which employment 
    growth in the industries that would benefit from climate change policies (e.g., 
    renewable energy) would offset the decrease in employment in industries that 
    would suffer as the result of climate change policies (e.g., fossil fuels). 
    These studies could also consider frictional unemployment.</li>
  <li>More generally, an assessment is needed of how sectoral costs of mitigation 
    can be minimized and distributed more equitably, both at the national and 
    the global levels. Babiker <i><i>et al</i></i>. (2000) found that macroeconomic costs for 
    the US increased when climate change policies excluded one or more economic 
    sectors. However, this study did not indicate the benefits, if any, to the 
    protected sector.</li>
  <li>More research is needed on the ancillary and co- benefits of GHG mitigation 
    and other objectives of transport policies (reductions in air pollution, lower 
    levels of traffic congestion, fewer road crashes).<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
