<p><i>Decision-making Process and Behaviour</i><b> </b><br>
  Many organizations are interested in using the most economically competitive 
  technology, in terms of cost and availability of fuels, though not necessarily 
  in terms of energy or carbon efficiency. The most competitive investments offer 
  short payback periods, minimize overall investment, and receive an attractive 
  rate of return. In such a framework, a relatively narrow range of technologies 
  exists. Most of them are efficient in the economic sense but not necessarily 
  in relation to GHG emissions reductions or avoidance. This represents a significant 
  barrier to both developed and developing countries.</p>
<p>Co-generation as a distributed technology is an example of this type of barrier 
  (<a href="212.htm#box55">Box 5.5</a>). Another example of the &#147;competitive&#148; 
  decision-making process as a barrier is typified in the case of Argentina, where 
  systems with shorter payback periods (such as natural gas-fired systems) are 
  favoured over others (<a href="#box56">Box 5.6</a>). Changes similar to those 
  described in <a href="#box56">Box 5.6</a> are taking place in other developing 
  and developed countries as well.</p>
<p>Uncertainty and risk aversion discourage long-term investments. Many forms 
  of sustainable energy production require long-term investment. Most multilateral 
  and international lending institutions are averse to technologically risky investments. 
  As a result, both government and private entities may be reluctant to invest 
  in high-tech projects that entail high capital costs (ECOSOC, 1994).</p>

    <td class="box"><b>Box 5.6. Argentine Power Supply: Some Barriers Related 
      to Institutional and Regulatory Topics </b> 
      <p>There is no doubt that the Argentine electric power system shows a trend 
        towards the improvement of energy efficiency, both in final consumption 
        as well in electricity-supply activities. Rising competition levels within 
        the electricity industry are favouring efficiency in electricity generation. 
        However, market trends show a rising dependency on natural gas to the 
        detriment of the participation of non-GHG emitting technologies.</p>
      <p>Several obstacles will have to be overcome to modify this trend. These 
        are related to the following aspects.</p>
      <p><b>Spot and contract prices</b>. Within a context of falling prices at 
        the spot market, distributors have been reluctant to long-term fixed price 
        commitment. In fact, the indicator used to adjust the price at distribution 
        level is the spot price. Should its supply be totally or partially contracted, 
        the distributor cannot transfer to retail rates the costs of their contracts 
        if they have, occasionally, a higher price than the spot. Long-term payback 
        investment, with higher investment costs, major risks, and lower internal 
        rate of return, are not favoured by a context based on spot prices.</p>
      <p><b>Volatility of prices</b>. A system with important hydro generation 
        capacity shows variation depending on hydrological conditions. Dry and 
        humid years represent important impacts on the income of hydroelectric 
        generators and introduce an additional source of risk. This volatility 
        could potentially increase if the interconnection with the Brazilian system 
        becomes a reality in the short term. The Brazilian system is almost entirely 
        supplied with hydroelectric generation, which has frequent surplus capacity. 
        This surplus or non-firm energy, with zero value, could enter the Argentine 
        wholesale market and introduce a fantastic volatility in the spot price 
        market which would affect all generators.</p>
      <p><b>Behaviour</b>. Private investors are reluctant about options that 
        imply higher risks, longer payback, lower internal rate of return, and 
        high investment per unit of capacity. The decision-making process clearly 
        shows this behaviour: all the new capacity installed after the privatization 
        process is based on open and combined cycle thermal power plants using 
        natural gas as fuel. In the past, Argentine public utilities, using lower 
        discount rates, assuming higher risks, and making investments assisted 
        by the multilateral financing system, developed an important hydropower 
        system that represented near 50% of the supply. The new context offers 
        lower opportunities for this &#147;old&#148; technology, and acts as a 
        barrier to a more &#147;costly&#148; option from a private point of view.</p>
      <p><b>Economics of the technologies</b>. In the case of nuclear power plants, 
        additional costs for waste treatment, plant decomissioning, and insurance 
        reduce the competitiveness of this technology. In the case of hydroelectric 
        stations, the payments of royalties, the need for insurance, and the transmission 
        network expansion mechanism (payback in 15 years) increase the costs and 
        decreases the possibilities of such technologies in the decision-making 
        behaviour described above.</p>

<p>The lack of performance data for newer energy technologies often results in 
  an unwillingness on the part of smaller firms to risk purchasing these more 
  expensive technologies. While they may offer greater future savings than traditional 
  technologies, the lack of test data prompts fears that reported energy savings 
  may not materialize in practice. </p>
<p>The uncertainty inherent in new technologies leads investors to use high discount 
  rates, which would make investments that are clearly cost-effective from a global 
  perspective seem unattractive to private actors (Bouille, 1999). In the case 
  of energy-efficiency investments, however, some may be for well-established 
  technologies with low technological and economic risk. </p>
<p>Inclusion of renewable energy in a wholesale electricity market could affect 
  price volatility for generators. Volatility is remarkably affected by hydroelectricity 
  supply. Any mitigation action which increases the share of such a source in 
  the electricity market will most likely contribute to further price volatility, 
  increasing the level of risk for the actors. </p>
<p><i>Social and Cultural Constraints </i><br>
  The environmental impacts and risks of technologies, such as nuclear power and 
  hydropower generation, may not be acceptable to many social groups. The real 
  or perceived environmental risks of such technologies pose a significant barrier 
  to their implementation (Bouille, 1998).</p>
<p><i>Cultural Aspects Related with Decentralized Systems in Rural Areas </i><br>
  There are cultural barriers that oppose the use of decentralized systems in 
  rural areas. Renewable energy is often promoted in rural areas to reduce local 
  environmental impacts, and accomplish social and welfare goals. While these 
  technologies may be competitive, easy to operate, and adequate for the project 
  needs, technology diffusion is often confronted with cultural barriers (Barnett, 
  1990).</p>
<p>In order to overcome cultural and social barriers, a project must take into 
  account the needs of potential users of the project technology, and harmonize 
  the diffusion strategy with local physical, human, and institutional resources. 
  A project should also build local technical and institutional capabilities so 
  the project may be fully realized (Barnett, 1990). </p>
<p><i>Capital Availability</i><br>
  There are substantial opportunities in developing countries for expansion of 
  electricity supply. While the capacity being installed is improving in efficiency, 
  this process is slowed by difficulties in accessing the necessary capital. Many 
  ESTs require large up-front investments. In effect, the cost of pollution abatement 
  is paid in advance. This is a serious obstacle for some technologies, particularly 
  nuclear power generation and large hydropower schemes. These technologies also 
  have other constraints, however. A reduction in nuclear unit size and/or improved 
  safety and maintenance features could help to overcome this barrier. </p>
<p>Co-generation or combined production of power and heat is a much more efficient 
  process than the production of each of these energy sources alone. Implementation 
  of co-generation, however, faces barriers such as shortages of capital. There 
  is also currently a lack of regulatory policies allowing commercialization of 
  the excess electricity produced through access to existing grid systems (<a href="212.htm#box55">Box 
  5.5</a>).</p>
