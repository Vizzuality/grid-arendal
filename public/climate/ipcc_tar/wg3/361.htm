<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>Many of the studies addressing the impact of CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation on oil 
  producers are worth describing in more detail. Rosendahl (1996) uses a competitive 
  dynamic model of the oil market with oil as an exhaustible resource. A constant 
  unit cost of extraction and fixed amount of the oil resource are assumed in 
  analyzing the impact of constant unit carbon tax. The model finds that a US$12/barrel 
  carbon tax would reduce global oil wealth (defined as the net real value of 
  accumulated oil production) by 33%&#150;42% and non-OPEC oil wealth 40%&#150;54%, 
  with the lower figure reflecting an assumed low price elasticity of -0.5<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#5","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>5</sup></small></a>. 
  Doubling the carbon tax would reduce global oil wealth by 58%&#150;74% and non-OPEC 
  wealth by 70%&#150;96%. The average producer could lose about 10% of their wealth 
  at the low tax assumption (US$3/barrel) and around two-thirds of their wealth 
  at the high tax assumption (US$24/barrel). The marginal carbon tax increase 
  would reduce the producers&#146; price, or the resource rent, by 33%&#150;50%, 
  and increase the consumer price by 50%&#150;67% of the tax increase.</p>
<p>Berg <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1997) examine the effect of a global CO<sub>2</sub> tax on the 
  global oil, gas and coal markets using Statistics Norway&#146;s PETRO model. 
  They use an optimizing, intertemporal equilibrium model with three demand regions 
  (OECD-Europe, rest-OECD and non-OECD) and two supply regions (OPEC and the competitive 
  fringe). They find that in the first 40 years starting in 1995, given a US$10/barrel 
  oil-equivalent (boe<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>) 
  carbon tax and assuming OPEC exercised market power, OPEC&#146;s oil wealth 
  would be reduced by 20% and non-OPEC&#146;s oil wealth by 8%, and the tax revenue 
  would be collected by consuming countries. The tax reduces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  by 20% below the baseline levels over the first 50 years, and then eliminates 
  fossil fuel combustion altogether by 2110; this comes about through an assumption 
  of a falling real price for backstop (carbon-free) technology. Lindholt (1999) 
  follows up this study, looking at the implications of a CO<sub>2</sub> tradable 
  auctioned permit scheme to meet (a) Kyoto-style targets interpreted as CO<sub>2</sub> 
  (not GHG) targets and (b) a global reduction below 1990 levels of 5.2% with 
  emissions held constant 2010 to 2100. OPEC&#146;s production in (a) is reduced 
  by 10% relative to the baseline in 2010 (the permit price is US$6.2/boe) rising 
  sharply after 2040 before falling to zero in 2070, but oil prices are maintained 
  to 2010; in (b) the reduction is 22% by 2010. Again for 2010 most of the permit 
  revenues go to Annex B countries.<br>
  <br>
  Donovan <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1997) model the economic impact of two CO<sub>2</sub> emission 
  reduction scenarios compared to a reference case with no limits on emissions. 
  In their less stringent scenario, Annex B countries stabilize their CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions from fossil fuels at 1990 levels by 2010; in their more stringent 
  scenario, they reduce their emissions to 15% below 1990 levels by 2010. Their 
  model projections show oil use in 2010 reduced by 3.7% and 5.9% respectively 
  in the less severe and more severe scenarios. These relatively small reductions 
  are attributed to the fact that most oil is used in the transport sector where 
  there is relatively little opportunity for substitution. In 2010, in the less 
  stringent case, the value of oil exports from non-Annex B to Annex B countries 
  declines by about 8%. <br>
</p>
<p>Jacoby <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1997) use an emissions predictions and policy analysis (EPPA) 
  model, a CGE model derived from the OECD GREEN model. The world is divided into 
  12 trading regions, 8 production sectors, including 5 energy sectors, and 4 
  consumption sectors, as well as government and investment sectors. Model results 
  show that when a quantitative emissions reduction is applied to the OECD region, 
  all other regions suffer welfare loss from the reduction in economic activity 
  and energy use in OECD, as well as the associated adjustment in prices of energy 
  and the consequences on international trade. The welfare losses in energy exporting 
  countries are no greater than that in other regions owing to the influence of 
  backstop technologies on crude oil price and the net oil exports of the energy 
  exporters. The OECD&#146;s lower production of the backstop (carbon-intensive 
  heavy oil) leads to increased demand for crude oil; in addition the oil price 
  is higher. Without the backstop technology constraint, the energy exporters 
  suffer the largest welfare loss of all the regions.<br>
</p>
<p>Ghanem <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1998) use OWEM, an econometric model, to analyse the potential 
  impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on OPEC members to 2020. The reference case for 
  this study assumes a real oil price of US$17.4/barrel (1997$) in 2000, growing 
  at 1.5%/year in real terms after that, and an average autonomous energy efficiency 
  improvement of 1%/year, with higher rates in China and the economies in transition 
  (EIT). The world economy is assumed to grow at 3.3%/year from 2000 to 2020. 
  OPEC&#146;s production in 2020 is projected at 51.6M barrels/day (crude + natural 
  gas liquids), and its share of world oil production is projected at 51.2%. Two 
  scenarios are examined: firm oil prices, i.e., remaining at the reference level, 
  and soft oil prices, US$16.9/barrel from 2000 to 2020. World oil demand in 2020 
  is projected at 100.7M barrels/day in the reference case, dropping to 81.1M 
  barrels/day (OPEC at 33M barrels/day) in the firm oil price case and 83.6M barrels/day 
  (OPEC at 37.8) in the soft price case. In the firm oil price case, OPEC has 
  a cumulative loss in revenue compared to the base case of 20.6% (US$659bn), 
  declining to 17.9% with trading. The loss rises to 27.2% (US$870bn) when oil 
  prices are lower.<br>
</p>
<p>Brown <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1999) use the global trade and environment model (GTEM), a general 
  equilibrium model of the world&#146;s economy, to evaluate the impact of the 
  Kyoto Protocol&#146;s commitments, with and without unrestricted international 
  emissions trading. The study does not consider the enhancement of sinks or the 
  use of the CDM as mitigation policies. GTEM seeks the minimum cost for mitigation 
  of 3 GHGs (CO<sub>2</sub>, methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)) 
  and up to 54 economic sectors, covering 45 countries. GTEM results show that 
  trading significantly reduces the losses in oil production in 2010 for all countries 
  or regions reported. Because of the many assumptions that have to be made and 
  the sector-specific impacts of emissions trading, only low confidence can be 
  assigned to specific numerical results, but the benefits of unrestricted international 
  emissions trading for oil producing countries has been confirmed in many studies. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Bartsch and M&uuml;ller (2000) use CLIMOX, a global economic-environmental 
  simulation model based on GREEN and GTAP, to simulate the effects of two Kyoto 
  scenarios on the global oil market. The &#147;most likely&#148; scenario assumes 
  the implementation of the Protocol and its extension to the year 2020, with 
  the policy instruments relying heavily on CO2 trading permits among Annex B 
  countries. Oil production declines by 3% in 2010 and 5% in 2020, and global 
  oil revenues fall by an average of 12%. The model assumes supplies of conventional 
  oil peaking in 2015 and a CH4 leakage tax raising the price of natural gas<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a>. 
  The &#147;global compromise&#148; scenario assumes a global agreement to be 
  achieved after 2012 incorporating all countries with world oil demand falling 
  by 8% in 2020. Oil revenues fall by 19% in 2020 and by 32% in the absence of 
  international emissions trading.<br>
</p>
<p>A number of studies (Kassler and Paterson, 1997; Ghasemzadeh, 2000; Pershing, 
  2000) have considered how impacts on oil producing countries might be alleviated. 
  Options include: use of emissions trading and the CDM; removal of subsidies 
  for fossil fuels that distort market behaviour; energy tax restructuring according 
  to carbon content; increased use of natural gas, since many oil exporters are 
  also major gas exporters; and efforts to diversify the economies of oil exporting 
  countries.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, Pershing (2000) points out that studies of the impact of GHG mitigation 
  policies on the oil industry typically do not consider some or all of the following 
  policies and measures that could lessen the impact on oil exporters:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>policies and measures for non-CO<sub>2</sub> GHGs or non-energy sources 
    of all GHGs; </li>
  <li>offsets from sinks; </li>
  <li>industry restructuring (e.g., from energy producer to supplier of energy 
    services); </li>
  <li>the use of OPEC&#146;s market power; and</li>
  <li>actions (e.g., of Annex B parties) related to funding, insurance, and the 
    transfer of technology</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the studies typically do not include the following policies and 
  effects that can reduce the total cost of mitigation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the use of tax revenues to reduce tax burdens or finance other mitigation 
    measures; </li>
  <li>ancillary environmental benefits of reductions in fossil fuel use; and</li>
  <li>induced technical change from mitigation policies.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>As a result the studies may tend to overstate both the costs to oil exporting 
  countries and overall costs. <br>
