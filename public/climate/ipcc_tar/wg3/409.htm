<h2>10.3 Local and/or National Sustainable Development Choices and Addressing 
  Climate Change </h2>
<h3><a name="1031"></a>10.3.1 Introduction</h3>
<p><a href="048.htm">Chapter 1</a> presented three perspectives on climate 
  change mitigation: cost-effectiveness, equity, and sustainability. The first 
  perspective dominates much of the assessments reviewed in the previous chapters 
  and sections. It is also dominant in the scientific literature on climate change 
  mitigation. As discussed in <a href="056.htm">Sections 1.3</a> and <a href="061.htm">1.4</a>, 
  other key perspectives are relevant for mitigation assessment as well: equity 
  and sustainability. This is especially relevant for the assessment of mitigative 
  capacity at local and national levels, and certainly for incorporating climate 
  change mitigation policies into national development agendas. </p>
<p>Decision making related to climate change is a crucial aspect of making decisions 
  about sustainable development, simply because climate change is one of the most 
  important symptoms of &#147;unsustainability&#148;. Climate change could undermine 
  economic activities, social welfare, and equity in an unprecedented manner, 
  in particular both intra- and intergenerational equity is likely to be worsened. 
  Now it is widely recognized that global environmental problems and the ability 
  to meet human needs are linked through a set of physical, chemical, and biological 
  processes that have an impact on global hydrological cycles, affect the boundaries 
  and functioning of ecological systems, and accelerate land degradation and desertification.</p>
<p>Despite the close links, climate change and sustainable development have been 
  pursued as largely separate discourses. The sustainable development research 
  community has not generally considered how the impacts of changing climate may 
  affect efforts to develop more sustainable societies. Conversely, methodological 
  and substantive arguments associated with sustainable development are still 
  absent in climate change discourse. It is difficult to generalize about sustainable 
  development policies and choices. Sustainable development implies and requires 
  diversity, flexibility, and innovation. Policy choices are meant to introduce 
  changes in technological patterns of natural resource use, production and consumption, 
  structural changes in the production systems, spatial distribution of population 
  and economic activities, and behavioural patterns. Moreover, the process of 
  integrating and internalising climate change and sustainable development policies 
  into national development agendas requires new problem-solving strategies and 
  decision-making approaches in which uncertainties need to be managed to produce 
  robust choices.</p>
<p>In this section the dual structure of linkages between sustainable development 
  and climate change is discussed. The existence of positive synergistic effects 
  is reviewed, as is how specific strategies, especially those related to lifestyle 
  options and technology-transfer policies, could reinforce potential synergies. 
  Finally, the emergence of new and innovative decision frameworks, in which extended 
  peer community participation is essential to incorporate into the decision process 
  both the plurality of different legitimate perspectives and the management of 
  irreducible uncertainties in knowledge and ethics, is examined.</p>
