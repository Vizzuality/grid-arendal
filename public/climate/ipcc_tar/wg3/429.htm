<h4>10.3.4.2 Public and Private Decision Making</h4>
<p>Decision analysis largely addresses both sustainable development and climate 
  change at their most aggregated level as government policy. The implicit assumption 
  of the government as a single decision maker has resulted in scant attention 
  (even neglect) being paid to how government policies and decisions are connected 
  to lower hierarchical levels at which policies must be implemented. This issue 
  raises two interconnected questions: the first concerns the view of the government 
  as a homogeneous and unitary decision-making actor, and the second relates to 
  the links of government policies to everyday decisions by concerned stakeholders.</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, government structures involved in the decision-making 
  process vary considerably among countries. Some governments have established 
  interministerial committees to co-ordinate sustainable development policies, 
  including climate change strategies, while others have assigned responsibilities 
  to more formal permanent commissions or even to a ministry created specifically 
  to handle sustainable development policies. With many different institutions 
  involved in sustainable development issues, considerable confusion often exists 
  regarding who has the responsibility for policy formulation, where the authority 
  for making day-to-day decisions resides within the government, and how channels 
  of communication and decision making should be achieved between the different 
  actors involved. Institutional articulation remains one of the critical factors 
  affecting the consolidation of an effective decision-making process related 
  to sustainable development. Even if there exist rules and regulations that assign 
  competence, tasks, and responsibilities among the institutions involved, a considerable 
  gap exists between what might be desirable and what, for the most part, is practised.</p>
<p>Concerning the interface between macro-policies and the real decision-making 
  levels, the situation is no more encouraging. It is true that sustainable development 
  and climate change are primarily the responsibility of the government system 
  simply because national economy-wide policies have widespread effects on the 
  regulation of societal processes. As discussed above (<a href="412.htm">Section 
  10.3.2.2</a>), government policies shape structural changes in the production 
  systems, affect the spatial distribution patterns of population and economic 
  activities, influence behavioural patterns of the population, and regulate interaction 
  with the environment and resource-base system. However, as recognized (Jaeger 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998; Rayner and Malone, 2000) all too often, especially in developing 
  countries, the levers of state power have a small impact on or even no connection 
  with the local level, at which policies must be implemented by ordinary people 
  living in face-to-face communities.</p>
<p>Recent tendencies at different levels are emerging as appropriate responses 
  to increase the legitimacy and competence of local communities, associations, 
  movements, and NGOs in the public decision-making process. Increasing concern 
  of local populations directly affected by environmental problems, together with 
  current tendencies towards decentralization and weakening of authoritarian practices, 
  especially in many developing countries, have opened a new political scenario 
  for a more active participation of civil society in the public policy formulation 
  and decision process. Present trends towards reassigning the setting of rules 
  from government to the markets, together with the process of transferring the 
  provision of services from the public sector to private ownership, have redefined 
  the roles of social stakeholders. Within this context, sustainable development 
  policies are no longer seen as a hierarchically, government-controlled chain 
  of commands, but as an open process in which the principles of &#147;good governance&#148;&#151;transparency, 
  participation, pluralism, and accountability&#151;are becoming the key elements 
  of the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Public involvement in decision making is not a completely new phenomenon. For 
  instance, traditional participatory mechanisms, such as public hearings, notice 
  and comment procedures, and advisory committees, have been practised extensively 
  by US government agencies (Beierle, 1998). However, it is only lately that participatory 
  forms of decision making have acquired legitimacy and prominence in environmental 
  issues, mainly because of their complexity, uncertainty, large temporal and 
  spatial scales, and irreversibility (van den Hove, 2000). As discussed in <a href="430.htm">Section 
  10.3.4.3</a>, innovative mechanisms such as regulatory negotiations, mediations, 
  stakeholder consultation, collaborative decision-making techniques, community-based 
  methods, and others, are currently being applied by governments, institutions, 
  and local administrations, as well as by intergovernmental organizations. Rayner 
  and Malone (2000) conclude that, whether policy innovation and behavioural change 
  are led locally or nationally, &#147;they will be marked by a process of institutional 
  learning that either moves presently peripheral concerns about climate change 
  to the core of people&#146;s daily concerns or, at least, palpably and convincingly 
  links climate policies to these everyday concerns.&#148;</p>
