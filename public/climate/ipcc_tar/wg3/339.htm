<h4>8.2.4.3 Why Do Studies for the Same Country Differ?</h4>
<p>It is enlightening to consider why estimates of ancillary benefits (or costs) 
  for two different studies of the same country differ.</p>
<p>In the case of Chile, Dessus and O&#146;Connor (1999) estimate benefits of 
  about US$250/tC, as compared to US$62/tC in Cifuentes <i>et al.</i> (2000). 
  Half of the Dessus and O&#146;Connor (1999) benefits are attributable to effects 
  on intelligence quotient (IQ) associated with reduced lead exposure, an endpoint 
  not considered by Cifuentes <i>et al. </i>(2000) and by most studies. The large 
  lead&#150;IQ effect seems to be at variance with US and European studies that 
  consider this and more conventional endpoints. Also, the VSL used by Dessus 
  and O&#146;Connor (1999) is more than twice as large as that used by Cifuentes 
  <i>et al.</i> (2000; US$2.1 million versus US$0.78 million by the year 2020). 
  These choices were driven by alternative benefit transfer approaches: Dessus 
  and O&#146;Connor (1999) used 1992 purchasing power parity to transfer a mid 
  estimate of US VSL, while Cifuentes<i> et al.</i> (2000) used 1995 per capita 
  income differences and the exchange rate to transfer a lower bound US VSL. This 
  comparison illustrates that the choice of benefit transfer approach in estimating 
  ancillary benefits dominates by far the modelling choices (Dessus and O&#146;Connor 
  (1999) used a T-D model while Cifuentes <i>et al.</i> (2000) used a B-U approach).</p>
<p>For the USA, Burtraw <i>et al. </i>(1999) found that for a US$25 carbon tax, 
  the ancillary benefits per tonne are US$2.30, while Abt Associates and Pechan-Avanti 
  Group (1999) found that for a slightly larger tax (US$30), the ancillary benefits 
  per tonne are US$8. For a US$50/tC tax, Burtraw <i>et al.</i> (1999) found ancillary 
  benefits of only US$1.50/tC, while for an even larger tax (US$67), Abt Associates 
  and Pechan-Avanti Group (1999) estimated the ancillary benefits to be US$68/tC. 
  These differences are explained by:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The effect of a unit change in particulate nitrates (derived from NO<sub>x</sub> 
    emissions) on the mortality rate which in Burtraw <i>et al.</i> (1999) are 
    about one-third of those used by Abt Associates and Pechan-Avanti Group (1999).<br>
  </li>
  <li>The value of statistical life used to value mortality risk reductions (about 
    35% lower in Burtraw <i>et al.</i> (1999) who adjust the VSL for the effects 
    of pollution on older people rather than on those of average age).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Sectors included (Burtraw <i>et al., </i>1999) are restricted to the electricity 
    sector by 2010, and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions per unit carbon are projected 
    to be lower for this sector than in the general US economy.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Effect of carbon tax on SO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Abt Associates and Pechan-Avanti 
    Group, 1999) finds that the US$67 carbon tax is large enough to bring SO<sub>2</sub> 
    emissions significantly under an SO<sub>2</sub> cap 60% lower than the current 
    cap. It also cuts NO<sub>x</sub> emissions enough to bring significant numbers 
    of non-attainment areas under the national ambient standards. Burtraw <i>et 
    al. </i>(1999) does not find such a large effect.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Baseline emissions (Burtraw <i>et al.</i>, 1999) do not account for new, 
    tighter ozone and PM standards, but Abt Associates and Pechan-Avanti Group 
    (1999) do (while assuming only partial attainment of the standards). This 
    baseline assumption leaves lower emissions of conventional pollutants to be 
    controlled in the Abt Associates and Pechan-Avanti Group (1999) study than 
    in the Burtraw<i> et al.</i> (1999) study.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="8244"></a>8.2.4.4 Conclusions </h4>
<p>The diffusion of methods and key studies to estimate health effects and their 
  monetization has contributed to a reasonable degree of standardization in the 
  literature. However, some of the differences in estimates result from different 
  assumptions and/or methodologies used to estimate them: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Selection of concentration&#150;response functions, such as use of time 
    series rather than the cohort mortality studies.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Consideration of more and/or different endpoints, such as considering the 
    lead effects on IQ.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Use of different assumptions to perform benefit transfers across countries 
    and across time. For example, considering per capita income as opposed to 
    purchasing power parity to perform the unit value transfer; choice of the 
    income elasticity value. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Defining the baseline differently: most of the literature on ancillary benefits 
    systematically treats only government regulations with respect to environmental 
    policies. In contrast, other regulatory policy baseline issues, such as those 
    relating to energy, transportation, and health, are generally ignored, as 
    have baseline issues that are associated to technology, demography, and the 
    natural resource base.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, although the standard methodology is generally accepted and applied, 
  a number of assumptions or judgements can lead to estimates of ancillary benefits 
  in terms of US$/tC for a given country that differ by more than an order of 
  magnitude. The least standardized, least transparent and most uncertain component 
  for modelling ancillary benefits is the link from emissions to atmospheric concentrations, 
  particularly in light of the importance of secondary particulates to public 
  health.</p>
<p>Also, the above review reveals implicitly the lack of studies estimating non-health 
  effects from GHG mitigation policies (damages from traffic crashes, the effects 
  of air pollution on materials, and air pollution effects on crops losses, which 
  have been shown to be quite high in some regions). Depending upon the GHG mitigation 
  policies selected, some of this damage could well be reduced, but the nature 
  of this relationship remains a speculative matter. More information can be found 
  in sectoral studies reviewed in <a href="353.htm">Chapter 9</a>, but no comprehensive 
  evaluation can be derived from them.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, it remains very challenging to arrive at quantitative 
  estimates of the ancillary benefits of GHG mitigation policies. Despite the 
  difficulties, it can be said that the ancillary benefits related to public health 
  accrue over the short term, and under some circumstances can be a significant 
  fraction of private (direct) mitigation costs. With respect to this category 
  of impacts alone mortality tends to dominate. The exact magnitude, scale, and 
  scope of these ancillary benefits varies with local geographical and baseline 
  conditions; if the baseline scenario assumes a rapid decrease in non-GHG pollutant 
  emissions, benefits may be low, especially in low density areas. Net ancillary 
  costs (i.e., where the ancillary benefits are less than ancillary costs) may 
  occur under certain conditions, but the models reviewed here are generally not 
  designed to capture these effects. While most of the studies assessed above 
  address ancillary benefits of explicit climate mitigation measures, it should 
  be noted that in many cases, these ancillary benefits can be expected to be 
  as least as important as climate mitigation for decision making. Hence, the 
  terms co-benefits is also used in this report. Therefore, there is a strong 
  need for more research in the area of integrated policies addressing climate 
  mitigation alongside other environmental, social or economic objectives. <br>
