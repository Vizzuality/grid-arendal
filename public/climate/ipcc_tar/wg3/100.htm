<h3>3.4.4 New Technology and Other Options</h3>
<p>Significant energy efficiency technologies that less than ten years ago were 
  thought too &#147;long-term&#148; to be considered in an assessment of fuel 
  economy potential through 2005 (NRC, 1992), are now available for purchase in 
  at least some OECD countries. The US Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles 
  (PNGV), the European &#147;Car of Tomorrow&#148; and Japanese Advanced Clean 
  Energy Vehicle programmes have helped achieve these striking successes. In December 
  1997, a commercial hybrid electric vehicle was introduced in Japan, demonstrating 
  a near doubling of fuel economy over the Japanese driving cycle for measuring 
  fuel economy and emissions. In 1998, a practical, near zero-emission (considering 
  urban air pollutants) gasoline-powered passenger car was developed, and demonstrated. 
  This achievement established the possibility that modern emissions control technology, 
  combined with scientific fuel reformulation, might be able to achieve virtually 
  any desired level of tailpipe emissions at reasonable cost using conventional 
  fossil fuel resources. Emissions problems now limit the application of lean-burn 
  fuel economy technologies such as the automotive diesel engine. Advanced technologies 
  and cleaner fuels may achieve similar results for lean-burn gasoline and diesel 
  engines in the near future. Such advances in urban air pollutant emissions controls 
  for fossil fuel burning engines reduce the environmental incentives for curbing 
  fossil fuel use by road vehicles. Automotive fuel cells also realized order 
  of magnitude reductions in size and cost, and dramatic improvements in power 
  density. The status of these key technologies is reviewed below.</p>

<h4>3.4.4.1 Hybrid Electric Vehicles</h4>
<p>A hybrid electric vehicle combines an internal combustion engine or other fuelled 
  power source with an electric drivetrain and battery (or other electrical storage 
  device, e.g., an ultracapacitor). Potential efficiency gains involve: (1) recapture 
  of braking energy (with the motor used as generator and captured electricity 
  stored in the battery); (2) potential to downsize the engine, using the motor/battery 
  as power booster; (3) potential to avoid idling losses by turning off the engine 
  or storing unused power in the battery; and (4) increasing average engine efficiency 
  by using the storage and power capacity of the electric drivetrain to keep engine 
  operation away from low efficiency modes. Toyota recently introduced a sophisticated 
  hybrid subcompact auto, the Prius, in Japan and has since introduced a version 
  into the US market. Honda also began selling in model year 2000 its Insight 
  hybrid, a two seater. Ford, GM, Daimler/Chrysler and several others have hybrids 
  in advanced development. The most fuel-efficient hybrid designs can boost fuel 
  economy by as much as 50% at near-constant performance under average driving 
  conditions. The added complexity of the dual powertrain adds significantly to 
  the cost of hybrids, and this could hinder their initial market penetration 
  in countries with low fuel prices, unless policies are adopted to promote them.</p>
<p>Hybrids attain their greatest efficiency advantage&#151;potentially greater 
  than 100%&#151;over conventional vehicles in slow stop-and-go traffic, so that 
  their first applications might be urban taxicabs, transit buses, and service 
  vehicles such as garbage trucks. An assessment of the potential for hybridization 
  to reduce energy consumption by medium-sized trucks in urban operations concluded 
  that reductions in l/100km of 23% to 63% could be attained, depending on truck 
  configuration and duty cycle (An <i><i>et al</i></i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Testing the Toyota Prius under a variety of driving conditions in Japan, Ishitani 
  <i><i>et al</i></i>.,(2000) found that the hybrid electric design gave 40%&#150;50% better 
  fuel economy at average speeds above 40 km/h, 70%&#150;90% better in city driving 
  at average speeds between 15 and 30 km/h and 100%&#150;140% better fuel economy 
  under highly congested conditions with average speeds below 10 km/h. Actual 
  efficiency improvements achieved by hybrids will depend on both design of the 
  vehicle and driving conditions. Much of the efficiency benefit of hybrids is 
  lost in long-distance, constant high-speed driving.</p>

<h4>3.4.4.2 Lower Weight Structural Materials</h4>
<p>Mass reduction via materials substitution is a potentially important strategy 
  for improving light-duty vehicle fuel economy, because it permits synergistic 
  reductions in engine size without loss of performance. The use of alternative 
  materials to reduce weight has been historically restrained by cost considerations, 
  manufacturing process technology barriers, and difficulty in meeting automotive 
  requirements for surface finish quality, predictable behaviour during crash 
  tests, or repairability. The past few years have seen significant developments 
  in space frame structures, advanced new manufacturing technology for plastics 
  and aluminium, and improved modelling techniques for evaluating deformability 
  and crash properties. Ford has displayed an advanced lightweight prototype that 
  is a mid-size car with a weight of only 900 kg, as compared to vehicles weighing 
  1450 kg today. Even if some of the more exotic weight-saving materials from 
  Ford&#146;s prototype were discarded, a weight reduction of 30% or more appears 
  possible. With engine downsizing to maintain a constant ratio of kW/kg, this 
  should produce a 20% fuel economy improvement. Some aluminium-intensive luxury 
  cars have already been introduced (for example, the Audi A8 and the new Volkswagen 
  Lupo with 3l/100km consumption), and Ford is known to be considering the introduction 
  of such a vehicle in the mass market.</p>

<p>According to Bouwman and Moll (1999), 85% of life cycle vehicle energy use 
  occurs in the vehicle use phase, with about 15% accounted for in vehicle production 
  and about 3% recovered in recycling. Mass reductions of 30% to 40% via extensive 
  substitution of aluminium for steel have been incorporated in the designs of 
  advanced, high fuel economy prototypes, improving fuel economy by 20% to 25%. 
  Because the production of aluminium requires more energy than production of 
  steel, and the recycling of aluminium auto bodies is more difficult given current 
  recycling technology, the benefits of substituting aluminium for steel must 
  be assessed by a life cycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions (efforts are 
  being made to improve aluminium recycling technology, however). Analyses have 
  shown that accounting for life cycle impacts diminishes, but does not eliminate 
  GHG emission reductions caused by the use of aluminium for mass reduction in 
  motor vehicles (<a href="#fig39">Figure 3.9</a>). The amount of reduction, however, is sensitive 
  to several key assumptions. Considering the total life cycle emissions for a 
  typical passenger car in the USA, Das (2000) concluded that higher net emissions 
  in the production plus recycling stages would reduce the potential GHG benefits 
  of aluminium in the vehicle use stage by 6.5% versus conventional steel auto 
  bodies, but by 15.8% versus advanced, ultra-light steel body (ULSAB) designs.</p>
<p>Because the increased emissions come first in the production stage, there is 
  a &#147;recovery&#148; period before net emissions reductions are realized. 
  Das (2000) found a recovery period of four years versus steel but 10 years versus 
  ultra-light steel auto-bodies (ULSAB) for an aluminium-intensive vehicle. An 
  analysis by Clark (1999) of aluminium versus conventional steel, assuming fewer 
  lifetime kilometres, found a cross-over point at approximately eight years for 
  a single vehicle, but at 15 years for an expanding fleet of aluminium-intensive 
  vehicles. In comparison to ULSAB, the car fleet crossover point was found to 
  be at 33 years. In other OECD countries where lifetime vehicle kilometres may 
  be one-half, or less, the levels of the USA, the cross-over points would be 
  even farther in the future. Sensitivity analyses have shown that the results 
  depend strongly on key assumptions, especially the sources of energy for aluminium 
  production and lifetime vehicle miles.</p>
<p>Bouwman and Moll (1999) obtained similar results in scenarios based on the 
  growing Dutch passenger car fleet. A scenario in which aluminium vehicles were 
  introduced in 2000achieved lower energy use than a steel scenario after 2010. 
  By 2050, the aluminium scenario energy use was 17% below that of the all steel 
  scenario.</p>
