<h4>10.3.3.3.2 Technology Transfer: Demand Side </h4>
<p>With the tendency towards globalization and closer integration of most countries 
  in the world economy, countries generally have two sources of technologies: 
  they can either develop their own technologies or procure technologies from 
  other countries, adopting and developing them to fit the specific circumstances 
  (Ding, 1998). When technology transfer is carried out between developed and 
  developing countries, it is important to build up a mutual understanding. Developing 
  countries not only need technologies relevant to climate change mitigation, 
  but also those that are able to generate economic benefits and promote social 
  and economic development, recognizing differences in social aspects (such as 
  tradition and customs).</p>
<p>Besides the common problems of climate change, many developing countries are 
  facing the challenges of poverty eradication and economic development. Technology 
  development and technology transfer are effective mechanisms in alleviating 
  these problems. The introduction of technologies will help to reduce the cost 
  and shorten the time of technological development. For developing countries, 
  the transfer and diffusion of appropriate technologies plays a key role in taking 
  measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change, while pursuing the goal of 
  sustainable development (Xu, 1998).</p>
<p>The scope of technology transfer should not be limited to the technology itself. 
  The enabling environment of the technology should also be included. If technology 
  transfer is to bring about economic and social benefits, local capacities to 
  handle, operate, replicate, and improve the technology on a continuous basis 
  must be taken into account, as well as the institutional and organizational 
  circumstances. There is little developmental benefit in a technological initiative 
  that remains confined within a very narrow sphere of influence with scarce possibilities 
  of replication on a significant scale and without decreasing reliance on assistance 
  from abroad. Technology transfer needs to build up strong links between:</p>
<ul>
  <li>its operational context (tools, machines, equipment, processes);<br>
  </li>
  <li>the organizational environment (management organization, product operation, 
    and technology infrastructure); and<br>
  </li>
  <li>knowledge (experience, skills, vocational training, advanced training).</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases of technology transfer, much attention was paid to the accelerated 
  introduction of technologies and a high cost was paid to procure expensive technological 
  facilities. However, less attention was paid to the digestion, absorption, and 
  innovation of the introduced technologies, in other words, to the supportive 
  base for technological development. In some cases, technology transfer to increase 
  energy efficiencies achieved a one-off step of efficiency improvement, but disregarded 
  that reversion to previous patterns of efficiency must be prevented and failed 
  to ensure the basis for a continuing and self-sustained path of improving efficiency 
  in the future. In conclusion, the process of development, application, and dissemination 
  of technologies, and their accelerated commercialization, is not simply a technical 
  programme. It concerns a wide range of issues, including policy formulation, 
  personnel training, fund raising, and standardization; in general, an array 
  of interlinked factors are related to the sustainability and replication of 
  technological innovation. (Yang and Xu, 1998; Zhang, 1998; Xu, 1999).</p>
