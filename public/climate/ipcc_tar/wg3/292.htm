<p><a name="fig73"></a>No regrets options are by definition GHG emissions reduction 
  options that have negative net costs, because they generate direct or indirect 
  benefits that are large enough to offset the costs of implementing the options. 
  The costs and benefits included in the assessment, in principle, are all internal 
  and external impacts of the options. External costs arise when markets fail 
  to provide a link between those who create the &#147;externality and those affected 
  by it; more generally, when property rights for the relevant resources are not 
  well defined. External costs can relate to environmental side-impacts, and distortions 
  in markets for labour, land, energy resources, and various other areas. By convention, 
  the benefits in an assessment of GHG emissions reduction costs do not include 
  the impacts associated with avoided climate change damages. A broader definition 
  could include the idea that a no regrets policy would, in hindsight, not preclude 
  (e.g., by introducing lock-in effects or irreversibilities) even more beneficial 
  outcomes, but this is not taken up in the mitigation literature. The no regret 
  concept has, in practice, been used differently in costing studies, and has 
  in most cases not included all the external costs and implementation costs associated 
  with a given policy strategy.</p>
<p>The discussion of &#147;no regrets&#148; potential has triggered an extensive 
  debate, which is particularly well covered in the SAR (IPCC 1996a, Chapters 
  8 and 9). The debate is summarized rather simply in graphical form in <a href="#fig73">Figure 
  7.3</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#fig73">Figure 7.3</a> illustrates the production frontier (F) of 
  an economy that shows the trade-off between economic activity (Q) and emissions 
  reduction (E). Each point on the curve shows the maximum level of emissions 
  reduction for a given level of economic activity. The economy is producing composite 
  goods, namely an aggregation of all goods and services Q and environmental quality 
  E, which here represent GHG emissions. Given such an assumption it is possible 
  to construct a curve F(Q,E) that represents the trade-off between Q and E. For 
  a given economy at a given time, each point on F shows the maximum size of the 
  economy for each level of GHG emissions, and therefore it shows the loss in 
  economic output measured by Q associated with reductions in GHG emissions level 
  E. If the economy is at a level below F then it is possible to increase the 
  total production of Q and/or E. If O is taken as the starting point of the economy 
  in <a href="#fig73">Figure 7.3</a> then all movements in the &#147;triangle&#148; 
  OO&cent;O&cent;&cent; increase environmental quality E and/or economic output 
  Q, but do not decrease either of these goods. Movements to positions outside 
  this &#147;triangle&#148; imply a decrease in both economic activity Q and environmental 
  quality E, or a trade-off in which one of these two goods decreases.</p>
<p>In estimating the costs, the crucial question is where the baseline scenario 
  is located with respect to the efficient production frontier of the economy 
  F. If the chosen baseline scenario assumes that the economy is located on the 
  frontier, as in the efficient baseline case, there is a direct trade-off between 
  economic activity and emissions reduction. Increased emissions reduction moves 
  the economy along the frontier to the right. Economic activity is reduced and 
  the costs of mitigation increase. If the economy is below the frontier, at a 
  point such as O, there is a potential for combined GHG emissions reduction policies 
  and improvements of the efficiency of resource use, implying a number of benefits 
  associated with the policy. </p>
<p>Returning to the implications for the cost of climate change mitigation, it 
  can be concluded that the no regrets issue reflects specific assumptions about 
  the working and efficiency of the economy, especially the existence and stability 
  of a social welfare function, based on a social cost concept. Importantly, the 
  aggregate production frontier is uncertain, as it is dependent on the distribution 
  of resources and is changed by technological development. Since it also involves 
  the weighting of different goods and services by market valuations to form an 
  aggregate, it is also affected by personal and social preferences that influence 
  those valuations.</p>
<p>The critical question is how climate change mitigation policies can contribute 
  to efficient and equitable development of the economy. </p>
<p>In this way it can be argued that the existence of a no regret potential implies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>that market and institutions do not behave perfectly, because of market 
    imperfections such as lack of information, distorted price signals, lack of 
    competition, and/or institutional failures related to inadequate regulation, 
    inadequate delineation of property rights, distortion-inducing fiscal systems, 
    and limited financial markets; <br>
  </li>
  <li>that it is possible to identify and implement policies that can correct 
    these market and institutional failures without incurring costs larger than 
    the benefits gained; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>that a policy decision is made to eliminate selectively those failures that 
    give rise to increased GHG emissions. </li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the existence of market and institutional failures that give 
  rise to a no regrets potential is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition 
  for the potential implementation of these options. The actual implementation 
  also requires the development of a policy strategy that is complex and comprehensive 
  enough to address these market and institutional failures and barriers.</p>
<p>The costs that actually face private agents are different from the social costs, 
  and therefore the market potential (as defined in <a href="179.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>) may be very different from the potential based on social costs. This 
  implies that the actual implementation of no regrets options requires that it 
  be possible to introduce policies that &#147;narrow the gap&#148; between the 
  market potential and a potential estimated on the basis of social costs. Cameron 
  <i>et al</i>. (1999) give a systematic overview of market failures and market 
  barriers important to the implementation of no regrets options.</p>
<p>Returning to the implications for climate change mitigation cost, it can be 
  concluded that the no regrets issues reflect specific assumptions about the 
  location of the economy in relation to the efficient production frontier. Bottom-up 
  studies have (in most cases on the basis of a specific assessment of production 
  practices in main GHG emitting sectors, such as the energy sector) assumed that 
  the economy in the baseline case operates below the optimal frontier and that 
  mitigation policies imply an increased efficiency of technologies. The costs 
  of implementing mitigation policies are then partly offset by direct and indirect 
  benefits, which sometimes are large enough to generate a negative cost result. 
  Top-down approaches, however, assume that the economy is efficient in the baseline 
  case and mitigation policies therefore always imply a trade-off with other goods 
  and thereby have a positive cost. <br>
