<p>The above review of the literature on cost-effective GHG mitigation (including 
  the chapters in this report) shows that elements of development, equity, and 
  sustainability are addressed in some of the analyses. However, they generally 
  take the form of boundary conditions, barriers, or constraints rather than the 
  primary motivation of the analysis. There is also a large and growing volume 
  of research that approaches mitigation directly from a concern with equity and 
  development (<a href="056.htm#fig13">Figure 1.3</a>). While in principle, equity 
  concerns pertain to at least three domains<a href="fn1.htm#5" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#5","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>5</sup></small></a> 
  &#150;international, intra-country, and inter-generational&#150;much of this 
  literature focuses on the international dimensions of equity, and takes as its 
  primary challenge the goal of sustainable development and poverty eradication 
  in developing countries, (Parikh, 1992; Parikh and Parikh, 1998; Murthy, 2000). 
</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, although this literature starts with concerns about global 
  equity, one of its central concerns is the promotion of the prospects of sustainable 
  development, especially in developing countries. Accordingly, we have entitled 
  this approach, &#147;equity and sustainable development&#148;.</p>
<p>An important motivation for this literature is climate change agreements in 
  which equity&#150;at all relevant levels (intergenerational, intragenerational, 
  international, and intranational)&#150;is a prominent and consistent theme. 
  The first principle of the UNFCCC (1992, Article 3.1) 
  states: &#147;The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit 
  of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in 
  accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective 
  capabilities. Accordingly, the developed country Parties should take the lead 
  in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof.&#148; </p>
<p>The UNFCCC goes on to require developed countries to assist developing countries 
  in coping and adapting with the impacts of climate change (Articles 
  4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 
  4.9, 4.10), recognizes that 
  &#147;economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first 
  and overriding priorities of the developing countries&#148; (Article 
  4.7), and, indeed, that &#147;Parties have a right to and should promote 
  sustainable development&#148; (Article 3.4). The Kyoto 
  Protocol retained this emphasis by referring to various paragraphs of Article 
  4 of the UNFCCC (1992), and refrained from imposing additional commitments 
  on developing countries (UNFCC, 1997b Article 10, preamble). 
  It reiterated the goal of sustainable development and established the CDM to 
  assist developing countries in achieving sustainable development while contributing 
  to the ultimate objectives of the UNFCCC (1997b, Article 
  12.2; see also Jacoby et al., 1998; Najam and Page, 1998; Jamieson, 2000; 
  Agarwal et al., 2000).</p>
<p>Finally, the issue of equity has been discussed not only with regard to the 
  distribution of resources and burdens within and between generations, but also 
  in terms of the role that it plays in the generation of social capital. Along 
  with reproducible, natural, and human and intellectual capital, social capital 
  is necessary for sustainability (Rayner et al., 1999; for related arguments, 
  see also Hahn and Richards, 1989; Toman and Burtraw, 1991; Rose and Stevens, 
  1993). Fairness is integral to the establishment and maintenance of social relations 
  at every level, from the micro to the macro, from the local to the global.</p>
  What is fair may be the subject of disagreement, but the demand for fairness 
  only arises because of the existence of community. It is very hard to imagine 
  what fairness would mean if we did not live and work together in families, communities, 
  firms, nations, and other social arrangements that persist over time (Rayner, 
  1995).<br>
