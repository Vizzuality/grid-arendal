<h3>5.3.2 Prices </h3>
<p>Prices can have an important influence on the consumption of resources and 
  hence on GHG emissions. There is extensive literature on the use of prices to 
  reflect environmental and other social costs associated with resource use. If 
  such costs were fully reflected in prices, they would encourage producers and 
  consumers to adopt environmentally sustainable technologies and practices. Where 
  an adequate legal framework exists, it should be possible in principle for those 
  suffering the effects of pollution or climate change to seek compensation from 
  those responsible. In practice, markets in environmental and social damages 
  function poorly, if at all, because transaction costs (e.g., the costs for victims 
  to identify polluters and seek compensation) are high compared with the environmental 
  and social costs suffered.</p>
<p>Where environmental and social costs are not reflected in markets (i.e., they 
  are externalities), there are many ways in which governments can internalize 
  them, notably through environmental regulations and taxes. However, governments 
  have to balance a large number of objectives and the outcome may not be efficient 
  in linking resource prices to GHG emissions. A variety of different types of 
  government policy tend to reduce prices, in addition to the direct budgetary 
  subsidies that are often introduced to support employment in particular sectors 
  or to enable the poor to meet basic energy needs (OECD, 1997b). Examples include 
  policies requiring electric utilities to provide universal, low-priced access 
  to grid systems or even to maintain supplies when consumers fail to pay their 
  bills (EBRD, 1999; World Bank, 1999). In India, electricity has historically 
  been subsidized for residential consumers, serving as a disincentive for the 
  adoption of efficient lighting and appliances (Alam <i>et al</i>., 1998). When energy 
  subsidies are reformed or removed, transitional or permanent supports are often 
  required for some of the former recipients (OECD, 1997b). For example, in Russia, 
  the introduction of long-run marginal cost electricity pricing has led to pensioners 
  being unable to afford their electricity bills, requiring support that amounts 
  to 20%-35% of local authority budgets (Gritsevich, 2000).</p>
<p>Government policies to address a wide range of environmental and social problems 
  can encourage GHG mitigation by increasing the prices of carbon-intensive energy 
  sources or decreasing the prices of non-carbon options. Such policies include 
  pollution taxes and charges for the use of infrastructure and services, subsidies 
  for renewable energy, and regulations requiring producers to sell electricity 
  generated from low-carbon sources.</p>
<p>The developers of new technologies often seek to recover their investment in 
  R&amp;D through license fees for the use of their innovations. Such license 
  fees may inhibit the adoption of the best available technology for GHG mitigation 
  in developing countries.</p>
<p>Energy price expectations can have a strong influence on investments in low-GHG 
  technology. Where energy prices fluctuate in unpredictable ways, investors may 
  tend to delay investments in new technology, and be unwilling to adopt low-emission 
  technology where this entails increased up-front costs. The next section discusses 
  the effects of risk on investment. </p>
<p>A substantial literature has developed on the tendency of consumers and businesses 
  to pay more attention to initial investments than operating costs, when considering 
  technology choices (Hassett and Metcalf, 1995; Jaffe and Stavins, 1995). In 
  the past, prices for some types of appliance, such as refrigerators, have tended 
  to show little correlation with energy intensity within a given range of size 
  and performance characteristics (Greening <i>et al</i>., 1997). The prices of appliances 
  and vehicles are influenced by many factors, not least their aesthetic features, 
  and energy efficiency is usually a minor source of variation. On the other hand, 
  several governments have used taxation to introduce a price incentive for buying 
  cars with smaller engines, lower fuel consumption, and to encourage the use 
  of alternative fuel vehicles (IPCC, 1996; ECMT, 1997).</p>
