<h3>10.2.7 Political Science Perspectives </h3>
<p>Game theory and other rational-choice approaches are used frequently in political 
  science. However, political science research considers political processes in 
  more detail and their findings complement the results presented above, at least 
  on three major issues. Although these extensions have important implications 
  for the conclusions here, the basic insights remain the same.</p>
<p>While game theory analysis usually models states as unitary actors, much political 
  science research conceives of states as complex political systems. The behaviour 
  of a complex actor can be seen as a function of three main determinants: the 
  internal configuration of preferences, the internal distribution of influence 
  and power, and the nature of political institutions (which specify the decision 
  rules). Domestic decision-making processes often produce outcomes that differ 
  significantly from those that maximize the net national welfare. Particularly 
  relevant in this context are three findings that illustrate systematic biases.</p>
<p>First, in &#147;baseline&#148; circumstances, the measures that are most easily 
  adopted and implemented are those that offer tangible benefits to a specific 
  sector of the economy or organized segments of society, while costs are widely 
  dispersed throughout society (Underdal, 1998). For most conventional environmental-protection 
  measures, costs are concentrated while benefits are indeterminate or widely 
  dispersed, which indicates that&#151;unless the issue really mobilizes the general 
  public&#151;the odds favour opponents to the measures, particularly in the implementation 
  phase.</p>
<p>Second, (environmental) damage that hits the &#147;social centre&#148; of society 
  tends to generate more political energy than damage that affects the social 
  periphery only. This bias is stronger the more skewed the distribution of economic 
  and political resources. This suggests, for example, that damage suffered primarily 
  by poor farming communities in developing countries generates a less vigorous 
  political response than damage that hits the infrastructure of the &#147;modern&#148; 
  sectors of the economy (e.g., as a consequence of extreme weather events).</p>
<p>Third, domestic political processes often generate political &#147;friction&#148; 
  that limits the scope for international package deals and compensatory arrangements. 
  Only compensation that benefits the domestic actor(s) who are blocking a particular 
  solution&#150;or more powerful actors&#150;will be fully effective. Only a subset 
  of the compensatory arrangements that make sense in terms of economic criteria 
  will pass the test of political feasibility. These issues of national DMFs are 
  explored in <a href="382.htm">Section 10.1</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the research reviewed above examines climate change policy in isolation, 
  on its own merits only. In the real world, new issues enter a policy space that 
  is already crowded by other problems competing for attention. In such an environment, 
  the priority given to a particular issue and the chances that a particular option 
  will be adopted depend on how well it combines with other salient concerns. 
  As we have seen in, for example, the acid rain case, policy confluence and synergy 
  can make a significant difference for some of the parties. However, although 
  the causal mechanism itself is well understood, it is triggered by circumstances 
  that occur more or less at random. Thus, the aggregate net impact in terms of 
  the climate change regime cannot be predicted (even if issue linkage, as seen 
  above, may be a powerful strategy).</p>
<p>The conventional assumption in game theory analysis is that each party aims 
  to maximize its own welfare, defined&#151;when dealing with environmental problems&#151;in 
  terms of damage and abatement costs. Political science research modifies this 
  assumption in three different directions.</p>
