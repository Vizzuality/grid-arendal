<h3>A3.2.1 Mobile Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>HFC-134a replaced CFC-12 in virtually all vehicle air conditioners produced 
  after 1993/94. Motor vehicle air conditioning uses HFC-134a refrigerant in an 
  integrated system of components that provide cooling, heating, defrosting, demisting, 
  air filtering, and humidity control. It is technically and economically feasible 
  to significantly reduce emissions of HFC-134a refrigerants: by recovery and 
  recycling of refrigerant during servicing and vehicle disposal; by using high 
  quality components with low leakage rates, hoses with lower permeation rates, 
  and improved connections; and by minimizing refrigerant charge. Efficiency improvements 
  and smaller, lighter units can further reduce energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions. New systems using alternative refrigerants &#150;carbon dioxide or 
  hydrocarbons&#150; are being developed as described below (see <a href="#a3213">Section 
  A3.2.1.3</a>).</p>
<a name="a3211"></a> 
<h4>A3.2.1.1 Estimates of Global HFC-134a Emissions</h4>
<p>Globally, 65%&#150;75% of air-conditioned vehicles in service in 2000 have 
  HFC-134a air conditioners and it is predicted that between 2000 and 2010, 70%&#150;80% 
  of all new vehicles will have HFC-134a air conditioners. This projection assumes 
  a continuation of current trends of mobile air conditioning installed in vehicles 
  in normally cool climates where air conditioning may not be necessary. When 
  air conditioning systems were redesigned to use HFC-134a, vehicle manufacturers 
  used a smaller refrigerant charge and reduced leakage rates. Typical direct 
  HFC emissions over a 10-year period in the USA are 1.4 kg if recycling is undertaken 
  during service and disposal and 3.2 kg without recycling (Baker, 2000). Estimates 
  for HFC-134a air conditioner emissions are included in <a href="#taba33">Table

<h4>A3.2.1.2 Strategies for Reducing Emissions and Improving Energy Efficiency 
  of HFC-134a Systems</h4>
<p>Vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers are working to increase the energy 
  efficiency and reduce the emissions of HFC-134a systems. Typical CO<sub>2</sub> 
  exhaust emissions resulting from air-conditioner operation are in the range 
  of 2% to 10% of total vehicle CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (SAE, 2000). Comparison 
  of reduced emissions HFC-134 systems and CO<sub>2</sub> systems have been published 
  (Petitjean et al., 2000; March, 1998). HFC-134a systems can be redesigned for 
  higher energy efficiency and smaller refrigerant charge within 2&#150;4 years, 
  and manufacturers of replacement parts could supply high-quality components 
  within 2&#150;4 years (SAE, 2000). SAE (2000) estimates that improved HFC-134a 
  systems can be introduced faster and at lower incremental cost than carbon dioxide, 
  hydrocarbon, and HFC-152a systems.</p>
<p>Lowering the demand for cooling and humidity control can reduce indirect emissions 
  from fuel consumption and could allow smaller air conditioning systems having 
  reduced refrigerant charges. This is accomplished by increasing thermal insulation 
  and decreasing thermal mass in the passenger compartment, by sealing the vehicle 
  body against unwanted air infiltration, by minimizing heat transfer through 
  window glass, and by controlling the compressor to minimize over-cooling and 
  subsequent re-heating of air.</p>
<a name="a3213"></a> 
<h4>A3.2.1.3 Strategies for Developing Efficient Alternative Air Conditioning 
  Systems</h4>
<p>Considerable activity is underway to develop alternatives to HFC-134a air conditioning 
  systems for vehicles. Prominent efforts are the European &#147;Refrigeration 
  and Automotive Climate Systems under Environmental Aspects (RACE) Project&#148; 
  (Gentner, 1998), and the Society of Automotive Engineers/US EPA/Mobile Air Conditioning 
  Society Worldwide &#147;Mobile Air Conditioning Climate Protection Partnership&#148; 
  (SAE, 1999, 2000).</p>
<p>Two categories of alternative refrigerant candidates have emerged for new systems: 
  1) transcritical carbon dioxide systems and 2) hydrocarbon or HFC-152a systems.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Transcritical CO<sub>2</sub> systems require substantial new engineering, 
    reliability, and testing efforts. These carbon dioxide systems have potential 
    energy efficiency that is comparable or better than HFC-134a systems and the 
    lowest direct global warming emissions of any candidate refrigerant. Prototype 
    systems from several European vehicle manufacturers provided comparable passenger 
    cooling comfort in medium-sized vehicles, and one reported improved efficiency 
    over HFC systems at the Scottsdale Symposium (SAE, 1999). A CO<sub>2</sub> 
    system in a small vehicle was less efficient, especially during idling (Kobayashi 
    et al., 1998). With a higher heat rejection temperature compared to HFC-134a 
    cycles, carbon dioxide systems can also efficiently operate in reverse mode 
    to heat vehicle interiors. New equipment and technician training will be required 
    to safely repair systems with operating pressures up to 6 times higher than 
    systems with HFC-134a. The first CO<sub>2</sub> systems could be commercially 
    available within 4-7 years (SAE, 2000).<br>
  <li> Hydrocarbon and HFC-152a systems, with secondary cooling loops to mitigate 
    flammability risk, are under study and development by several manufacturers 
    in co-operation with suppliers (Baker, 2000; Ghodbane 1999; Dentis et al., 
    1999; SAE, 1999a). One prototype achieved a cooling performance at the 1999 
    Phoenix Forum comparable to HFC-134a systems (Baker, 2000; Gentner, 1998; 
    Ghodbane, 1999; SAE, 2000). Systems using flammable refrigerants will require 
    additional engineering and testing, development of safety standards and service 
    procedures, and training of manufacturing and service technicians before commercialization, 
    but would require fewer technical breakthroughs than carbon dioxide systems. 
    If proven safe to Original Equipment Manufactures (OEMs), it is estimated 
    that systems with flammable refrigerants could be commercially implemented 
    in the first vehicles in as little as 4-5 years (SAE, 2000). 
</ol>
<p>Highly efficient air conditioning and heating systems are particularly important 
  to the commercial success of electric, hybrid, fuel cell, and other low-emission 
  vehicles to help overcome the limited power of such vehicles.</p>
<a name="a3214"></a> 
<h4>A3.2.1.4 Cost-Effectiveness of Reducing Emissions from Vehicle Air Conditioning</h4>
<p><i>Recovery and Recycle</i><br>
  It is estimated that recycling rates can be increased from 60% to 90% within 
  one to two years in developed countries (SAE, 2000). Recovery and recycling 
  of HFCs can reduce emissions by more than 10 kt annually (Baker, 1999). About 
  50% of the global fleet of HFC-134a air conditioned vehicles are in the USA 
  where recycling is mandatory, and 25% are in Japan, where voluntary programme 
  achieve a substantial recycling rate. The remainder are in Europe where recycling 
  ranges from zero in some countries to near 100% participation in others, and 
  in developing countries, where a wide range of recovery practices is found. 
  A UNDP survey of 1300 Brazilian garages found one-quarter of garages recycling 
  HFC-134a (UNDP, 1999).</p>
<p>The current market value of HFC-134a recovered during service or disposal in 
  the USA more than pays for the cost of labour, equipment, and maintenance for 
  shops servicing more than 6 vehicle air-conditioning systems per week. By 2002 
  to 2003 it is technically feasible to reduce system charge and leakage rates 
  significantly. Recovery of 0.33 kg of HFC-134a will cost US$0.70 in large shops 
  and US$1.50 in small shops. For large shops, recovery costs for improved, low-charge 
  vehicles are estimated at less than US$3.50/tC<sub>eq</sub>. Even for small 
  shops, the cost-effectiveness per tonne of carbon equivalent can then be calculated 
  in the range of US$1.18-12.81/tC<sub>eq</sub> depending upon the size of the 
  charge (EPA, 1998). </p>
<p><i>Reduced Charge and Improved Containment</i><br>
  By 2002 to 2003, it is technically feasible to reduce system charge and leakage 
  rates worldwide. It is estimated that the vehicle charge in the US can be reduced 
  from 0.9kg to 0.8kg and that annual vehicle leakage could be reduced from 0.07 
  kg/yr to 0.04kg/yr (UNEP, 1998a; Baker, 1998; Sand et al., 1997; Wertenbach 
  and Caesar, 1998). In Europe, refrigerant charges average about 0.7 kg per vehicle 
  (Clodic, 1999). For the USA it is estimated (Baker, 2000) that emissions can 
  be reduced from 8% to 5% per year for a 10-year reduction of 1.2 kg/vehicle 
  without recovery and recycling or 1.0kg with recovery and recycling. Two studies 
  (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000; March, 1998) estimate that, in Europe, the cost 
  per vehicle to reduce leakage rates from 10% to 4%-5%/yr is only US$11-US$13. 
</p>
<p><i>Alternative Systems</i><br>
  Three authors have published estimates of the cost of emission reductions achieved 
  through alternative vehicle air conditioning using carbon dioxide as the refrigerant 
  (March, 1998; Baker, 1999, 2000; Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000). These studies 
  reported widely diverging results on the specific abatement costs of HFC emissions 
  for the use of transcritical CO<sub>2</sub> systems (from US$90 to &gt;US$1000/tC<sub>eq</sub>). 
  Differences in cost estimates can be traced back to a number of factors among 
  which two are most important: (1) the use of producer-costs versus consumer 
  costs and (2) differing assumptions about the existing degree of recovery of 
  HFC-134a during servicing and at the end of life. Of lesser importance were 
  differing assumptions on the average fluid charge of an HFC air conditioning 
  system, annual leakage rates, relative differential costs, and applied discount 
  rates. Once the results are normalized to common assumptions on the major factors, 
  the abatement costs differ by only a factor of two or less (see <a href="#taba34">Table 
  A3.4</a>). <br>
  <br>
  As reported in <a href="#taba34">Table A3.4</a>, costs of avoiding HFC emissions 
  through alternative air conditioning systems vary between US$20 and US$2100/tC<sub>eq</sub> 
  depending on the emission characteristics of the reference HFC system (and on 
  whether consumer or producer prices are used). Consequently in countries where 
  systems already exist to ensure HFC recycling during servicing and at the end 
  of life, alternative air conditioning systems will need to exhibit significantly 
  reduced indirect emissions in order to be cost-effective in abating greenhouse 
  gas emissions. </p>
