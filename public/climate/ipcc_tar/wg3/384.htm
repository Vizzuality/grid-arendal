<h4>10.1.2.2 The Problem Is Long Term </h4>
<p><i>It is concentrations not emissions that matter</i><br>
  Climate change is related to the concentration of GHGs and not to any individual 
  year&#146;s emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations are closely 
  related to the net accumulation of emissions over long periods of time. That 
  is, it is the sum of emissions over time that determines the atmospheric concentration. 
  Any individual year&#146;s emissions are only marginally important<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a>. 
  Average residence times for GHGs can range up to thousands of years for some 
  of the anthropogenic species. Strategies to control net emissions must account 
  for long periods of time in a meaningful way. The ultimate objective of the 
  UNFCCC is the &#147;stabilization of GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at 
  a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate 
  system&#148; (UNFCCC 1993, Article 2).</p>
<p><i>Intergenerational transfers are inevitable</i><br>
  The consequences of climate change will be visited primarily on those who are 
  alive in the future. The present generation has inherited its atmosphere and 
  associated climate from its ancestors. While individuals and governments make 
  many decisions that affect future generations, most of these decisions are undertaken 
  inadvertently. It is impossible to avoid the intergenerational wealth-transfer 
  issue when addressing the climate problem. That most of the affected parties 
  are not present to participate in the decision-making process raises complicated 
  ethical questions. The implications of their absence are not immediately obviously. 
  Future generations have a stake both in the environmental resources, such as 
  climate, that they inherit, and in other wealth that is passed down to them. 
  Sacrifices that are made by the present generation for the good of its descendants 
  will alter the composition of wealth (e.g., environmental versus material) that 
  is transferred from the present to the future, as well as the magnitude of the 
  transfer. As climate change is anticipated to be greater in the future than 
  it is at present, those who live in the future will reap most of the benefits 
  that accrue to near-term actions to limit emissions. Intergenerational asymmetry 
  can lead to a form of public goods problem in which the willingness to undertake 
  emissions mitigation in the near-term may be less than would have been the case 
  if the decision makers lived infinitely. Also implied is a greater sensitivity 
  to emission-limitation costs than would be the case if the present generation 
  lived to benefit from its emissions-mitigation actions.</p>
<p><i>To limit the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, global carbon 
  emissions must eventually peak and then decline</i><br>
  This result follows from the nature of the carbon cycle, as it is presently 
  understood. While non-CO<sub>2</sub> GHGs with relatively short life times, 
  such as methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), have an atmospheric concentration that is 
  stable with a stable rate of annual emission, CO<sub>2</sub> does not. The cumulative 
  net introduction of carbon emissions from terrestrial reservoirs, such as fossil 
  fuels or biological carbon, through (for example) energy production and use 
  or land-use change, determines the long-term, steady state, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration. Carbon cycle models require net emissions to asymptotically approach 
  zero, though the process can take centuries. Most, but not all, emissions scenarios 
  anticipate that, in the absence of a concern for climate change, future GHG 
  emissions will continue to rise rather than fall (IPCC, 2000b). Where reference 
  emissions scenarios exhibit increasing emissions over time, most of the emissions 
  mitigation required to stabilize the concentration of carbon must occur in the 
  future, with the deviation from the profile required for stabilization growing 
  with time.</p>
<p><i>While emissions limitation is a policy response, it is not the only policy 
  response available to decision makers</i><br>
  In addition to emissions limitations, policymakers have a wide array of other 
  tools at their disposal including knowledge gathering, research and development 
  of technologies to reduce emissions and enhancing the resilience of societies 
  experiencing climate change. The optimal and actual mix of policy responses 
  will vary over time.</p>
