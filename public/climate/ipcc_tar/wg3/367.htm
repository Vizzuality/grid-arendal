<h3>9.2.6 Manufacturing</h3>
<p>The effects of GHG mitigation on manufacturing sectors are likely to be very 
  mixed, depending on the use of carbon-based fuels as inputs, and the ability 
  of the producer to adapt production techniques and to pass on increases in costs 
  to customers. Different manufacturing processes and technologies use carbon-based 
  inputs in very different amounts in relation to output. High carbon-intensive 
  sectors (using the UN System of National Accounts 1993 ISIC, p. 594-5) include 
  basic metals (aluminium, steel), other non-metallic mineral products (cement, 
  bricks, glass) and some chemicals (bulk chemicals). Low carbon-intensive sectors 
  include office machinery (electronics) and other chemicals (pharmaceuticals). 
  Several large sectors (food, textiles, machinery, and vehicles) are somewhere 
  between these extremes.<br>
</p>
<p>If the Kyoto Protocol is ratified, manufacturing sectors in Annex I countries 
  can expect to face mitigation policies to meet national targets. The possible 
  options for the firms are basically: (1) energy conservation (adoption of more 
  efficient technologies), (2) shift to products with lower carbon intensities, 
  (3) accept extra taxation or emission permits and the possible effect on profits 
  and/or product sales and (4) shift production abroad as foreign direct investment 
  or joint ventures.<br>
</p>
<p>Generally, adopting these options will create ancillary benefits and costs. 
  Speculative ancillary benefits include:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the adoption of energy conservation technologies that mitigates local air 
    pollution similar to the case of transportation sector;</li>
  <li>the accumulation of scientific and technological knowledge that contributes 
    to the development of new products and processes; and</li>
  <li>the internationalization of manufacturing that stimulates technology transfer 
    to developing regions and greater equity in wealth distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>If production is transferred to non-Annex B countries, ancillary costs include</p>
<ul>
  <li>losses in Annex B manufacturing employment; and</li>
  <li>increases in non-Annex B emissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the assessment of the effects of climate policy on manufacturing could 
  take into account the interactions between sectors and economies. Multisectoral 
  and multi-regional models have been used to evaluate them (see <a href="#9261">9.2.6.1</a> 
  below). </p>
<h4><a name="9261"></a>9.2.6.1 Effects on Manufacturing from Multisectoral Top-down 
  Studies<br>
</h4>
<p>Manufacturing sectors show mixed results in the multisectoral studies (see 
  <a href="356.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a> above). Reflecting industrial and financial 
  globalization, recent studies tend to involve international trade on both goods 
  and capital. In the main example, McKibbin <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1999) evaluate 
  the potential sectoral impacts of the Kyoto Protocol using the G-Cubed model, 
  mainly focusing on the real and the financial trading structure. In case of 
  unilateral action by the USA, the effects on manufacturing industries show at 
  most 1.4% and 1.2% decrease in quantity and price, respectively, although the 
  effects on the energy industry sectors are large, e.g., 56% down in the coal 
  mining industry with a 375.6% price increase in 2020.</p>
<h4><a name="9262"></a>9.2.6.2 Mitigation and Manufacturing Employment</h4>
<p>Some mitigation policies would increase output and employment in the energy 
  equipment industries. In 2010 under an innovation scenario for GHG mitigation 
  of 10% relative to 1990, GDP for the US is projected to increase by 0.02% (Laitner 
  <i><i>et al</i></i>. 1998). Wage and salary earnings are shown to rise in 2010 
  by 0.3% and employment (jobs) by 0.4%. From another perspective, these net job 
  gains might be all provided by new small manufacturing plants in the USA; in 
  that case, the redirected investments in energy-efficient and low-carbon technologies 
  would produce additional employment equivalent to the jobs supported by about 
  6200 small manufacturing plants that open in the year 2010. While these impacts 
  are small in relation to the larger economy, it is because the scale of investment 
  is also relatively small. The anticipated extra energy-efficiency and renewable-energy 
  investments in the year 2010 is less than 3% of US total investment in that 
  year. <br>

<p><a name="fig94"></a>Some bottom-up studies assess the relationships between 
  climate policy and technological strategy. For instance, the implementation 
  of a carbon tax or subsidies will strongly affect the investment decisions in 
  manufacturing sectors. Kainuma <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1999a) assess how a subsidy 
  affects the adoption of energy conservation technologies to meet Kyoto targets 
  using the AIM/ENDUSE model of Japan. <a href="#fig94">Figure 9.4</a> shows the 
  contribution of technologies undertaken by firms to reduce carbon emissions 
  in 2010. Subsidies of US$30/tC compare with a carbon tax of US$300/tC to meet 
  Kyoto targets without subsidies (using a rate of 100yen/$) (Kainuma <i><i>et 
  al</i></i>., 1997, 1999a).<br>
</p>
<p>For developing countries, environmental policy is often linked to technological 
  improvement. Jiang <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1998) assess the potential for CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emission reductions in China based on advanced energy-saving technology options 
  under various tax and subsidy measures. For example, they consider the adoption 
  of advanced coking-oven systems by the iron and steel industry in China. Without 
  changes in policy only 15.9% of existing ovens will be replaced by advanced 
  ones by 2010. With a carbon tax, but without a subsidy, the replacement share 
  rises to 62%. With a tax and subsidies for energy-saving technologies, the share 
  rises to 100%, i.e. the advanced ovens will be fully adopted by the industry. 
  They also mention that taxes with subsidies do not give the best solutions for 
  other sectors. They conclude that a carbon tax with subsidy could have reduced 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 110Mt of carbon-equivalent in 2000 and 360Mt in 
  2010, from the baseline case of 980Mt in 2000 and 1380Mt in 2010.</p>
<p>Energy-saving technologies across the sectors, such as material and thermal 
  recycling have a large potential to reduce carbon emission. Yoshioka <i><i>et 
  al</i></i>. (1993) employed input-output analysis to evaluate the potential 
  contribution of blast-furnace cement to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: improved 
  technology for the utilization of 1 tonne of blast furnace slag to produce cement 
  could reduce CO<sub>2</sub> by 0.85 tonnes. In the same manner, Ikeda <i><i>et 
  al</i></i>. (1995) estimated that the utilization of by-products in the steel 
  and iron industry, and of steel scrap could reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  by 2.4% in Japan in 1990.</p>
