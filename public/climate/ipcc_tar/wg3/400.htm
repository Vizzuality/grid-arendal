<h3>10.2.5 Partial Agreements </h3>
<p>The case of partial agreements is most often analyzed in recent empirical literature, 
  for two reasons. First, as shown in <a href="396.htm#1021">Section 10.2.1</a>, 
  theory suggests that a partial coalition forms at the equilibrium. Hence, the 
  climate problem is neither a &#147;tragedy of commons&#148; nor a situation 
  in which there are clear incentives to co-operative emission control. Second, 
  the history of international environmental negotiations is a history of partial 
  agreements that are slowly broadened as more and more countries decide to join 
  the group of signatories. In the case of climate, in particular, the Kyoto agreement 
  can be seen as a first partial climate agreement. Therefore, many papers have 
  dealt with the costs and benefits of the Kyoto agreement and with the possible 
  strategies to increase the number of countries that commit themselves to emission 
  control targets (see the papers gathered in OECD (1998), and in Carraro (1999b, 
  2000); see also Burniaux (1998), Capros (1998), Ellerman <i>et al</i>. (1998), 
  Grubb and Vrolijk (1998), Holtsmark (1998), Manne and Richels (1998), Mensbrugghe 
  (1998), Carraro, 1999c), Nordhaus and Boyer (1999), and the surveys by Metz 
  (1999) and Convery (1999)).</p>
<p>Two remarks are important. First, even if most recent analyses deal with the 
  Kyoto agreement, there are studies that try to compute the optimal coalition 
  structures, in terms of both participation and targets, independently of the 
  decisions taken in Kyoto (a recent attempt is in Nordhaus and Boyer (1999)). 
  Usually the conclusion derived from these papers is that Kyoto is neither economically 
  nor environmentally optimal. However, the notion of optimality is not very useful 
  when analyzing coalition formation. Indeed, what matters is the notion of the 
  stability of a coalition. This identifies which countries have an incentive 
  to join the coalition (sign the agreement) for different membership and institutional 
  rules, baseline scenarios, abatement costs (and therefore climate policies, 
  including the degree of adoption of Kyoto mechanisms), and environmental benefits 
  (and therefore impacts, adaptation costs, etc.).</p>
<p>Second, the Kyoto agreement can theoretically be interpreted as a partial (Carraro, 
  1998) or as a global agreement (Chander <i>et al</i>., 1999). It is interpreted 
  as a global agreement when all countries are seen as committed to emission targets. 
  Those in Annex B are committed to emission targets with respect to 1990, the 
  other ones are &#147;committed&#148; to emissions levels that evolve as in the 
  baseline scenario. This second interpretation is nothing more than a &#147;technical&#148; 
  interpretation, which is useful to show that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>optimal emissions targets are not necessary because the same optimal outcome 
    can be achieved through an international, unrestricted emissions-trading scheme 
    among all countries (Chander <i>et al</i>., 1999); and<br>
  </li>
  <li>the resultant outcome can be profitable to all countries if an appropriate 
    economic and technological transfer scheme is adopted (Markusen 1975; Chander 
    and Tulkens, 1995, 1997; Germain <i>et al</i>., 1997).</li>
</ul>
<p>As a consequence, even a &#147;partial&#148;, suboptimal agreement like Kyoto 
  can be transformed into a &#147;global&#148; optimal agreement (see <a href="430.htm">Section 
  10.3.5</a>).</p>
<p>Away from this ideal world of perfectly competitive and international market 
  mechanisms, are the analyses of coalitions that, like the coalition formed by 
  Annex I countries of the UNFCCC or Annex B countries of the Kyoto Protocol, 
  are partial (formed by a subgroup of the negotiating countries). In this context, 
  four questions need to be answered:</p>
<ol>
  <li type="a"> Are these partial coalitions effective?<br>
  </li>
  <li> Are they too costly for the signatory countries?<br>
  </li>
  <li> Can partial coalitions be enlarged by providing incentives for other countries 
    to join? and<br>
  </li>
  <li> Is there a distribution of emission targets and/or of abatement costs such 
    as to increase the size of partial coalitions and hence the effectiveness 
    of a climate agreement?</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) The answer to the first question depends on two main factors: the baseline 
  scenario and the degree of leakage. If the baseline scenario is very ambitious 
  and leakage is high, then countries find it difficult to undertake large emissions 
  reductions (decreasing returns of scale in emission abatement are usually assumed), 
  and also their effort is offset by the leakage effect (the increased emissions 
  by free-riding countries). Hence, a partial coalition is effective whenever 
  there is no or little leakage, high pollution levels characterize the baseline 
  scenario, and signatory countries contribute a large share of the total emissions.</p>
<p> (b) For the second question, many studies try to assess the cost for Annex 
  I countries of achieving given emissions targets under alternative policy options. 
  These policy options include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the timing of the mitigation responses (see the special issue of <i>Energy 
    Economics</i> edited by Carraro and Hourcade (1999));</li>
  <li>the degree of adoption of the Kyoto mechanisms and their features, such 
    as banking (see the papers in OECD (1998) and Carraro (1999d));<br>
  </li>
  <li>the role of complementary industrial policies, mainly designed to foster 
    innovation (see Nordhaus, 1997; Schneider and Goulder, 1997; Kopp <i>et al</i>., 
    1998; Buonnano <i>et al</i>., 1999); and<br>
  </li>
  <li>the effects of uncertainty about climate impacts or abatement costs (Carraro 
    and Hourcade, 1999).</li>
</ul>
<p>The main result can be summarized as follows. Despite their high variability, 
  all the studies show that the Kyoto mechanisms sensibly reduce the costs of 
  compliance, whatever the coalition structure. Hence, emissions trading, and 
  more generally the application of the Kyoto mechanisms, can reduce overall mitigation 
  costs without reducing the effectiveness of the climate policy. <a href="224.htm">Chapters 
  6</a> and <a href="319.htm">8</a> give an extensive overview of relevant studies<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#12","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>12</sup></small></a></p>
<p>If assuming an even broader type of flexibility than incorporated in the Kyoto 
  mechanisms (banking and borrowing and international emissions trading (IET) 
  among all countries) then compliance costs are further lowered. This result 
  is shown in Bosello and Roson (1999) for banking, Westskog (1999) for banking 
  and borrowing, Manne and Richels (1999a, 1999b), McKibbin <i>et al</i>. (1998), 
  and many others for IET among all countries. If in addition the incentives to 
  innovation provided by the Kyoto mechanisms are taken into account, then compliance 
  costs are even lower (Buonnano <i>et al</i>. 1999).</p>
