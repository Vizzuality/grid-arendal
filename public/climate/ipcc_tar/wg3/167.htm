<h4><a name="4321"></a>4.3.2.1 Wood Products</h4>
<p>Wood products are an integral part of the managed forest ecosystem and the 
  forest sector C cycle. They play three roles in the forest sector carbon cycle: 
  (1) a physical pool of carbon, (2) a substitute for more energy-intensive materials 
  and, (3) a raw material to generate energy (Burschel <i>et al</i>., 1993; Nabuurs and 
  Sikkema, 1998; Harmon <i>et al</i>., 1996; Karjalainen, 1996; Matthews <i>et al</i>., 1996; 
  Marland and Schlamadinger, 1997; Apps <i>et al</i>., 1999). </p>
<p>Wood removed from a forest by harvest, whether by thinning or clear-cut, can 
  be viewed as a replacement for the natural mortality that would otherwise occur 
  eventually (albeit at a faster rate). Harvested wood provides renewable raw 
  material for use as fuel, fibre, and building materials; as well as income and 
  employment for rural populations (Gl&uuml;ck and Weiss, 1996). Globally, about 
  3.4 billion m<sup>3</sup> of wood are harvested per year, excluding wood that is burned 
  on site (FAO, 1997). Harvest rates are expected to increase at 0.5% per year 
  (Solberg <i>et al</i>., 1996). Of the total harvest, about 1.8 billion m<sup>3</sup> is for fuelwood, 
  used mainly in the tropics. The total fuelwood consumption in tropical countries 
  increased from 1.3 to 1.7 billion m<sup>3</sup> during the period 1990 to 1995 (FAO, 1997; 
  Nogueira <i>et al</i>., 1998). </p>
<p>If the fossil fuel based energy required to produce and transport forest products 
  is less than that needed for alternative products, then CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  will be avoided by the use of forest products. Buchanan and Levine (1999) show, 
  for example, that when wood is used for building construction in place of brick, 
  aluminium, steel, and concrete, there can be net savings in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. For 
  construction of small buildings in New Zealand, the carbon substitution effect 
  was larger than the direct carbon storage in wood building products (Buchanan 
  and Levine, 1999). Forest products can also substitute in the marketplace for 
  alternative materials, such as cement, that involve carbon emissions in their 
  manufacture.</p>
<p>A systems approach has been used recently to recognize interdependencies among 
  products and sectors. For example, Adams (1992) and Alig <i>et al</i>. (1997) examined 
  the effects of sequestering C in forests in the USA on the availability of agricultural 
  land, and Sedjo and Sohngen (2000) used a sectoral approach that explicitly 
  recognized interrelations among various wood investment decisions, and between 
  wood investment and C sequestration activities. The systems approach also recognizes 
  the joint product nature of industrial wood and carbon sequestration. In a study 
  in Argentina, for example, Sedjo (1999b) found that timber alone does not generate 
  sufficient returns to justify plantation investment, but the simultaneous sequestration 
  of C can justify investment above some threshold C price. The models do not 
  yet incorporate a potential increase in demand for wood as a fuel to displace 
  fossil fuels.</p>
<p>In the developing world most fuelwood and charcoal use is devoted to satisfying 
  energy needs for cooking (Makundi, 1998). The potential for conservation of 
  fuelwood is significant, both through improved cooking stoves and by substitution 
  with liquefied or gasified biofuels. India, China, and some African countries 
  have large programmes for the distribution of more efficient wood stoves. In 
  India alone 28 million improved stoves have been disseminated (Ravindranath 
  and Hall, 1995). The carbon mitigation costs of improved wood stoves in India 
  range from US$0.10/tC abated (Luo and Hulscher, 1999) to US$12/tC abated (Ravindranath 
  and Somashekar, 1995). A review of case studies in Asia showed an average mitigation 
  cost of US$0.8/tC abated in Thailand to US$1.7/tC in India, through programmes 
  to encourage use of improved wood stoves (Hulscher <i>et al</i>., 1999). The experience 
  with wood stoves shows that &#150; when appropriately designed, implemented, 
  and monitored &#150; efficient stove programmes can provide substantial benefits 
  to local residents. There are no estimates of the global potential for carbon 
  conservation via this option, however, in India alone it is estimated that 20MtC 
  could be saved annually (Ravindranath and Hall, 1995).</p>
<p>There is also a significant potential for saving fuelwood and charcoal in a 
  large number of small industries. Charcoal making, brick making, pottery making, 
  bakeries, etc. use fuelwood as their primary energy source in many areas. Fuelwood 
  and charcoal consumption in tropical countries is projected to increase from 
  1.34 billion m<sup>3</sup> in 1991 to 1.81 billion m<sup>3</sup> in 2010 (FAO, 1993).</p>
<p>Most of the forest harvest in the boreal and temperate zone is for industrial 
  roundwood (i.e., cut logs). About one-half to two thirds of the roundwood finds 
  its way into final products, and the rest is used for energy or ends up as decomposing 
  residues (e.g., Apps <i>et al</i>., 1999). The annual production of roundwood, according 
  to FAO (1997) statistics, corresponds to a harvest flux of about 1.6 billion 
  m3, resulting in about 0.9 billion m<sup>3</sup> in final products. This represents a C 
  flux of about 0.3GtC/yr into the product pool.</p>
<p>According to the SAR (IPCC, 1996), the current global stock of C in forest 
  products is about 4.2GtC and the net sink is 0.026GtC/yr. Other sources suggest 
  a stock of 10-20GtC (Sampson <i>et al</i>., 1993; Brown <i>et al</i>., 1996b) and a global 
  sink of 0.139GtC/yr (Winjum <i>et al</i>., 1998). There is a large uncertainty in the 
  estimates. Even if the high end of the range is correct, the C sink in wood 
  products appears small compared to the current rate of C sequestration in boreal 
  and temperate forest ecosystems. Whether the physical pool of carbon in wood 
  products in use acts as a sink depends on the relative rates of input and output 
  from the product pool, i.e., the difference between the production of new products 
  and the decay of the C stock in existing products (Apps <i>et al</i>., 1999). </p>
<p>Options to increase physical sequestration of carbon in wood products include: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increasing consumption and production of wood products; </li>
  <li>Improving the quality of wood products;</li>
  <li>Improving processing efficiency; and</li>
  <li>Enhancing recycling and re-use of wood and wood products. </li>
</ul>
<p>Several studies have been carried out on the impacts of these measures on the 
  amount of carbon sequestered in wood products. These studies generally conclude 
  that the sink potential is quite small at the national or global level (Karjalainen, 
  1996; Nabuurs, 1996; Marland and Schlamadinger, 1997). </p>
<p>Use of wood as a fuel reduces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuels (Hall 
  <i>et al</i>., 1991; Brown <i>et al</i>., 1996a; Nabuurs, 1996; Marland and Schlamadinger, 
  1997). Where the costs of growing biofuels on agricultural lands are higher 
  than the costs of using fossil fuel, some form of incentive may be required 
  to generate significant shifts to biofuels (Sedjo, 1997). The use of abandoned 
  forest products for energy rather than disposal as waste can provide additional 
  opportunities for displacing use of fossil fuels (Apps <i>et al</i>, 1999). <a href="089.htm">Chapters 
  3</a> and <a href="224.htm">6</a> provide further discussion of the use of 
  bioenergy within the energy sector.</p>
<p>Micales and Skog (1997) estimate that of the total amount of carbon-based products 
  disposed of in the USA in 1993, as either paper or wood products, 28TgC (out 
  of a total domestic harvest of approximately 123TgC/yr) will remain stored in 
  landfills. Heath <i>et al</i>. (1996) and Karjalainen <i>et al</i>. (1994) emphasize the increasing 
  role of landfills as a store of C. Production of methane through anaerobic decomposition 
  deserves to be considered when evaluating the mitigation potential. </p>
<p>While C sequestration in wood products can reach saturation, the C benefits 
  of materials substitution can be sustained. Assuming a material substitution 
  effect of 0.28tC/m<sup>3</sup> of final wood product (Burschel <i>et al</i>., 1993), and a flux 
  corresponding to a roundwood volume of 0.9 billion m<sup>3</sup> annually, the substitution 
  impact of industrial wood products may be as large as 0.25GtC/yr. Although this 
  estimate is highly uncertain, it is possible that for wood products the substitution 
  impact is larger than the sequestration impact. This substitution is additional 
  to the sinks in wood products mentioned before.</p>
<h4><a name="4322"></a>4.3.2.2 Managing Wetlands</h4>
<p>Globally, wetlands contain large reserves of organic carbon - about 300 to 
  600GtC (Gorham, 1991; Eswaren <i>et al</i>., 1993; Scharpenseel, 1993; Kauppi <i>et al</i>., 
  1997). A major portion of this carbon is found in peat-forming wetlands (peatlands), 
  often associated with forests, in both northern (302Mha, 397GtC) and tropical 
  (50Mha, 144GtC) biomes (Zoltai and Martikainen, 1996). Over the long term, peatlands 
  gradually accumulate additional carbon, because decomposition is suppressed 
  under flooded conditions (Harden <i>et al</i>., 1992; Mitsch and Wu, 1995; Rabenhorst, 
  1995; Zoltai and Martikainen, 1996; Kasimir-Klemedtsson <i>et al</i>., 1997). The beneficial 
  effect of this carbon accumulation, however, is at least partially offset by 
  release of methane, which is also a GHG (Gorham, 1995).</p>
<p>There are few opportunities to augment the accumulation of carbon in wetlands 
  by improved management. Drainage of forested peatlands, largely concentrated 
  in boreal regions, can enhance tree growth significantly, but the net ecosystem 
  carbon changes are less clear &#150; some studies report large net gains while 
  others indicate large net losses of carbon to the atmosphere (see review by 
  Zoltai and Martikainen, 1996). A more important mitigation measure, from the 
  perspective of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, is the preservation of the vast carbon 
  reserves already present (van Noordwijk <i>et al</i>., 1997) in peatlands. Drainage 
  of wetlands for agricultural or other uses results in rapid depletion of stored 
  C (Kasimir-Klemedtsson <i>et al</i>., 1997).</p>
