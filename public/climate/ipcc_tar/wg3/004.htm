<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a name="1"></a>1. <i>This report assesses the scientific, technological, environmental, 
  economic and social aspects of the mitigation of climate change</i>. Research 
  in climate change mitigation <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a> 
  has continued since the publication of the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR), 
  taking into account political changes such as the agreement on the Kyoto Protocol 
  to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1997, 
  and is reported on here. The Report also draws on a number of IPCC Special Reports, 
  notably the Special Report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere, the Special 
  Report on Methodological and Technological Issues in Technology Transfer (SRTT), 
  the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), and the Special Report on 
  Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (SRLULUCF).<br>

<p><a name="2"></a>2. <i>Climate change <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>2</sup></small></a> 
  is a problem with unique characteristics</i>. It is global, long-term (up to 
  several centuries), and involves complex interactions between climatic, environmental, 
  economic, political, institutional, social and technological processes. This 
  may have significant international and intergenerational implications in the 
  context of broader societal goals such as equity and sustainable development. 
  Developing a response to climate change is characterized by decision-making 
  under uncertainty and risk, including the possibility of non-linear and/or irreversible 
  changes (Sections <a href="054.htm#125">1.2.5</a>, <a href="056.htm">1.3</a>, 
  <a href="383.htm">10.1.2</a>, <a href="389.htm">10.1.4</a>, <a href="445.htm">10.4.5</a>).

      <p><b>Figure SPM.1:</b> Comparison of reference and stabilization scenarios. 
        The figure is divided into six parts, one for each of the reference scenario 
        groups from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES, see<a href="005.htm#boxspm1"> 
        Box SPM.1</a>). Each part of the figure shows the range of total global 
        CO2 emissions (gigatonnes of carbon (GtC)) from all anthropogenic sources 
        for the SRES reference scenario group (shaded in grey) and the ranges 
        for the various mitigation scenarios assessed in the TAR leading to stabilization 
        of CO2 concentrations at various levels (shaded in colour). Scenarios 
        are presented for the A1 family subdivided into three groups (the balanced 
        A1B group (Figure SPM.1a), non-fossil fuel A1T (Figure SPM.1b) and the 
        fossil intensive A1FI (Figure SPM.1c)) with stabilization of CO2 concentrations 
        at 450, 550, 650 and 750 ppmv; for the A2 group with stabilization at 
        550 and 750 ppmv in Figure SPM.1d, the B1 group with stabilization at 
        450 and 550 ppmv in Figure SPM.1e, and the B2 group with stabilization 
        at 450, 550 and 650 ppmv in Figure SPM.1f. The literature is not available 
        to assess 1000 ppmv stabilization scenarios. The figure illustrates that 
        the lower the stabilization level and the higher the baseline emissions, 
        the wider the gap. The difference between emissions in different scenario 
        groups can be as large as the gap between reference and stabilization 
        scenarios within one scenario group. The dotted lines depict the boundaries 
        of the ranges where they overlap.</p>

  can result in very different greenhouse gas emissions</i>. The SRES and the 
  mitigation scenarios assessed in this report suggest that the type, magnitude, 
  timing and costs of mitigation depend on different national circumstances and 
  socio-economic, and technological development paths and the desired level of 
  greenhouse gas concentration stabilization in the atmosphere (see <a href="004.htm#figspm1">Figure 
  SPM.1</a> for an example for total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions). Development paths 
  leading to low emissions depend on a wide range of policy choices and require 
  major policy changes in areas other than climate change (Sections <a href="072.htm#222">2.2.2</a>, 
  <a href="074.htm#232">2.3.2</a>, <a href="079.htm#244">2.4.4</a>, <a href="080.htm#25">2.5</a>). 
</p>
<p><a name="4"></a>4. <i>Climate change mitigation will both be affected by, and 
  have impacts on, broader socio-economic policies and trends, such as those relating 
  to development, sustainability and equity</i>. Climate mitigation policies may 
  promote sustainable development when they are consistent with such broader societal 
  objectives. Some mitigation actions may yield extensive benefits in areas outside 
  of climate change: for example, they may reduce health problems; increase employment; 
  reduce negative environmental impacts (like air pollution); protect and enhance 
  forests, soils and watersheds; reduce those subsidies and taxes which enhance 
  greenhouse gas emissions; and induce technological change and diffusion, contributing 
  to wider goals of sustainable development. Similarly, development paths that 
  meet sustainable development objectives may result in lower levels of greenhouse 
  gas emissions (Sections <a href="056.htm">1.3</a>, <a href="061.htm">1.4</a>, 
  <a href="072.htm#223">2.2.3</a>, <a href="079.htm#244">2.4.4</a>,<a href="080.htm#25"> 
  2.5</a>, <a href="271.htm#722">7.2.2</a>, <a href="334.htm">8.2.4</a>).</p>
<p><a name="5"></a>5. <i>Differences in the distribution of technological, natural 
  and financial resources among and within nations and regions, and between generations, 
  as well as differences in mitigation costs, are often key considerations in 
  the analysis of climate change mitigation options</i>. Much of the debate about 
  the future differentiation of contributions of countries to mitigation and related 
  equity issues also considers these circumstances <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#5","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>5</sup></small></a> 
  . The challenge of addressing climate change raises an important issue of equity, 
  namely the extent to which the impacts of climate change or mitigation policies 
  create or exacerbate inequities both within and across nations and regions. 
  Greenhouse gas stabilization scenarios assessed in this report (except those 
  where stabilization occurs without new climate policies, e.g. B1) assume that 
  developed countries and countries with economies in transition limit and reduce 
  their greenhouse gas emissions first.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a> 
</p>
<p><a name="6"></a>6. <i>Lower emissions scenarios require different patterns 
  of energy resource development. <a href="005.htm#figspm2">Figure SPM.2</a></i> 
  compares the cumulative carbon emissions between 1990 and 2100 for various SRES 
  scenarios to carbon contained in global fossil fuel reserves and resources <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
  . This figure shows that there are abundant fossil fuel resources that will 
  not limit carbon emissions during the 21<sup>st</sup> century. However, different 
  from the relatively large coal and unconventional oil and gas deposits, the 
  carbon in proven conventional oil and gas reserves, or in conventional oil resources, 
  is much less than the cumulative carbon emissions associated with stabilization 
  of carbon dioxide at levels of 450 ppmv or higher (the reference to a particular 
  concentration level does not imply an agreed-upon desirability of stabilization 
  at this level). These resource data may imply a change in the energy mix and 
  the introduction of new sources of energy during the 21<sup>st</sup> century. 
  The choice of energy mix and associated investment will determine whether, and 
  if so, at what level and cost, greenhouse concentrations can be stabilized. 
  Currently most such investment is directed towards discovering and developing 
  more conventional and unconventional fossil resources (Sections <a href="080.htm#251">2.5.1</a>, 
  <a href="082.htm#252">2.5.2</a>, <a href="125.htm#383">3.8.3</a>, <a href="346.htm">8.4</a>).<br>
