<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to examine the major types of policies and measures 
  that can be used to mitigate net concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in 
  the atmosphere.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a> 
  Alternative policy instruments are described and assessed in terms of specific 
  criteria, on the basis of the most recent literature. Naturally, emphasis is 
  on the instruments mentioned in the Kyoto Protocol (the Kyoto mechanisms), because 
  they focus on achieving GHG emissions limits, and the extent of their envisaged 
  international application is unprecedented. In addition to economic dimensions, 
  political, economic, legal, and institutional elements are considered insofar 
  as they are relevant to the discussion of policies and measures.</p>
<p>Any individual country can choose from a large set of possible policies, measures, 
  and instruments to limit domestic GHG emissions. These can be categorized into 
  market-based instruments (which include taxes on emissions, carbon, and/or energy, 
  tradable permits, subsidies, and deposit&#150;refund systems), regulatory instruments 
  (which include non-tradable permits, technology and performance standards, product 
  bans, and direct government spending, including research and development investment) 
  and voluntary agreements (VAs) of which some fall in the category of market-based 
  instruments. Likewise, a group of countries that wants to limit its collective 
  GHG emissions could agree to implement one, or a mix, of instruments. These 
  are (in arbitrary order) tradable quotas, Joint Implementation (JI), the Clean 
  Development Mechanism (CDM), harmonized taxes on emissions, carbon, and/or energy, 
  an international tax on emissions, carbon, and/or energy, non-tradable quotas, 
  international technology and product standards, VAs, and direct international 
  transfers of financial resources and technology.</p>
<p>Possible criteria for the assessment of policy instruments include environmental 
  effectiveness, cost effectiveness, distribution considerations, administrative 
  and political feasibility, government revenues, wider economic effects, wider 
  environmental effects, and effects on changes in attitudes, awareness, learning, 
  innovation, technical progress, and dissemination of technology. Each government 
  may apply different weights to various criteria when evaluating policy options 
  for GHG mitigation, depending on national and sector-level circumstances. Moreover, 
  a government may apply different sets of weights to the criteria when evaluating 
  national (domestic) versus international policy instruments.</p>
<p>The economics literature on the choice of policies adopted emphasizes the importance 
  of interest-group pressures, focusing on the demand for regulation. However, 
  it has tended to neglect the &#147;supply side&#148; of the political equation, 
  which is emphasized in the political science literature of the legislators and 
  government and party officials who design and implement regulatory policy, and 
  who ultimately decide which instruments or mix of instruments will be used. 
  The point of compliance of alternative policy instruments, whether they are 
  applied to fossil fuel users or manufacturers, for example, is likely to be 
  politically crucial to the choice of policy instrument. And a key insight is 
  that some forms of regulation actually benefit the regulated industry, for example, 
  by limiting entry into the industry or by imposing higher costs on new entrants. 
  A policy that imposes costs on industry as a whole might still be supported 
  by firms who, as a consequence, would fare better than their competitors. Regulated 
  firms, of course, are not the only group with a stake in regulation: opposing 
  interest groups will fight for their own interests.</p>
<p>To develop reasonable assessments of the feasibility of implementing GHG mitigation 
  policies in countries in the process of structural reform, it is important to 
  understand this new policy context. Recent measures taken to liberalize energy 
  markets were inspired mainly by desires to increase competition in energy and 
  power markets, but they can have significant emissions implications also, through 
  their impact on the production and technology pattern of energy and/or power 
  supply. In the long run, the consumption pattern change might be more important 
  than the sole implementation of climate change mitigation measures (e.g. see 
  Chapter 2, the B1 scenario).</p>
<p>Market-based instruments&#150;principally domestic taxes and domestic tradable 
  permit systems&#150;are attractive to governments in many cases because they 
  are efficient; they are frequently introduced in concert with conventional regulatory 
  measures. When implementing a domestic emissions tax, policymakers must consider 
  the collection point, the tax base, the variation or uniformity among sectors, 
  the association with trade, employment, revenue, and the exact form of the mechanism. 
  Each of these can influence the appropriate design of a domestic emissions tax, 
  and political or other concerns are likely to play a role also. For example, 
  a tax levied on the energy content of fuels could be much more costly than a 
  carbon tax for the equivalent emissions reduction, because an energy tax raises 
  the price of all forms of energy, regardless of their contribution to carbon 
  dioxide emissions. Yet, many nations may choose to use energy taxes for reasons 
  other than cost-effectiveness, and much of the analysis in this chapter applies 
  to energy taxes as well as to carbon taxes.</p>
<p>A country committed to a limit on its GHG emissions can also meet this limit 
  by implementing a tradable permit system that directly or indirectly limits 
  emissions of domestic sources. Like taxes, permit systems pose a number of design 
  issues, including type of permit, sources included, point of compliance, and 
  use of banking. To cover all sources with a single domestic permit regime is 
  unlikely. The certainty provided by a tradable permit system that a given emission 
  level for participating sources is achieved incurs the cost of uncertain permit 
  prices (and hence compliance costs). To address this concern, a hybrid policy 
  that caps compliance costs could be adopted, but the level of emissions would 
  no longer be guaranteed.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, in most countries the management of GHG emissions 
  will not be addressed with a single policy instrument, but with a portfolio 
  of instruments. In addition to one or more market-based policies, a portfolio 
  might include standards and other regulations, VAs, and information programmes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Energy-efficiency standards have reduced energy use in a growing number 
    of countries. Standards may also help develop the administrative infrastructure 
    needed to implement market-based policies. The main disadvantage of standards 
    is that they can be inefficient, but efficiency can be improved if the standard 
    focuses on the desired results and leaves as much flexibility as possible 
    in the choice of how to achieve the results.</li>
  <li>VAs may take a variety of forms. Proponents of VAs point to low transaction 
    costs and consensus elements, while sceptics emphasize the risk of free riding, 
    and the risk that the private sector will not pursue real emissions reduction 
    in the absence of monitoring and enforcement.</li>
  <li>Imperfect information is widely recognized as a key market failure that 
    can have significant effects on improved energy efficiency, and hence emissions. 
    Information instruments include environmental labelling, energy audits, and 
    industrial reporting requirements, and information campaigns are marketing 
    elements in many energy efficiency programmes.</li>
</ul>
<p>A growing literature demonstrates theoretically, and with numerical simulation 
  models, that the economics of addressing GHG reduction targets with domestic 
  policy instruments depends strongly on the choice of those instruments. The 
  interaction of abatement costs with the existing tax structure and, more generally, 
  with existing factor prices is important. Policies that generate revenues can 
  be coupled with policy measures that improve the efficiency of the tax structure.</p>
<p>Turning to international policies and measures, the Kyoto Protocol defines 
  three international policy instruments, the so-called Kyoto mechanisms: international 
  emissions trading (IET), JI, and CDM.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>2</sup></small></a> 
  Each of these international policy instruments provides opportunities for Annex 
  I Parties<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>3</sup></small></a> 
  to fulfil their commitments cost-effectively. IET essentially allows Annex I 
  Parties to exchange part of their assigned amounts (AAs). IET implies that countries 
  with high marginal abatement costs (MACs) may acquire emissions reductions from 
  countries with low MACs. Similarly, JI allows Annex I Parties to exchange emissions 
  reduction units among themselves on a project-by-project basis. Under the CDM, 
  Annex I Parties receive Certified Emissions Reduction (CERs)&#150;on a project-by-project 
  basis&#150;for reductions accomplished in non-Annex I countries.</p>
<p>Economic analyses indicate that the Kyoto mechanisms could reduce significantly 
  the overall cost of meeting the Kyoto emissions limitation commitments. However, 
  to achieve the potential cost savings requires the adoption of domestic policies 
  that allow the use the mechanisms to meet their national emissions limitation 
  obligations. If domestic policies limit the use of the Kyoto mechanisms, or 
  international rules that govern the mechanisms limit their use, the cost savings 
  may be reduced.</p>
<p>In the case of JI, host governments have incentives to ensure that emission 
  reduction units are issued only for real emission reductions, assuming that 
  they face strong penalties for non-compliance with national emissions limitation 
  commitments. In the case of CDM, a process for independent certification of 
  emission reductions is crucial, because host governments do not have emissions 
  limitation commitments and hence may have less incentive to ensure that certified 
  emission reductions are issued for real emission reductions only. The main difficulty 
  in implementing project-based mechanisms, both JI and CDM, is to determine the 
  net additional emissions reductions (or sink enhancement) achieved. Various 
  other aspects of these Kyoto mechanisms await further decision making, including 
  monitoring and verification procedures, financial additionality (assurance that 
  CDM projects do not displace traditional development-assistance flows) and other 
  additionalities, and possible means of standardizing methodologies for project 
  baselines.</p>
<p>The extent to which developing country (non-Annex I) Parties effectively implement 
  their commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
  (UNFCCC; referred to as the Convention in this chapter) may depend on the effective 
  implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention 
  related to the transfer of financial resources and technology. The transfer 
  of environmentally sound technologies from developed to developing countries 
  is now seen as a major element of global strategies to achieve sustainable development 
  and climate stabilization.</p>
<p>Any international or domestic policy instrument can be effective only if accompanied 
  by adequate systems of monitoring and enforcement. There is a linkage between 
  compliance enforcement and the amount of international co-operation that will 
  actually be sustained. Many multilateral environmental agreements address the 
  need to co-ordinate restrictions on conduct taken in compliance with the obligations 
  they impose and the expanding legal regime under the World Trade Organization 
  (WTO) and General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) umbrella. Neither the 
  UNFCCC nor the Kyoto Protocol provides for specific trade measures in response 
  to non-compliance. But several domestic policies and measures that might be 
  developed and implemented in conjunction with the Kyoto Protocol could conflict 
  with WTO provisions. International differences in environmental regulation may 
  have trade implications also.</p>
<p>One of the main concerns in environmental agreements (including the UNFCCC 
  and the Kyoto Protocol) is with reaching wider participation. The literature 
  on international environmental agreements predicts that participation will be 
  incomplete, and so further incentives may be needed to increase participation.</p>
