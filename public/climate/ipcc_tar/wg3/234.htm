<h3>6.2.2 Climate and Other Environmental Policies </h3>
<p><a href="231.htm#621">Section 6.2.1</a> sets the general policy context in 
  which any environmental policy will operate. This section focuses on specific 
  policies to address climate change. The various policy instruments are assessed 
  generically. In other words, there is not a sector-specific focus, because it 
  is beyond the scope of this chapter. This may create some bias insofar as most 
  sector-specific policies are technology oriented and of the command-and-control 
  type.</p>
<h4><a name="6221"></a>6.2.2.1 Regulatory Standards</h4>
<p>Regulatory environmental standards set either technology standards or performance 
  standards, enforceable through fines and other penalties<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#24","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>24</sup></small></a> 
  (voluntary standards are discussed in <a href="238.htm">Section 6.2.2.4</a>). 
  They may attach to a product, a line of products (e.g., US Corporate Average 
  Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards), or the provision of a service (e.g., Japan requires 
  that firms employ an energy manager).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#25","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>25</sup></small></a> 
  In this chapter regulatory standards are distinguished from economic or market-based 
  instruments (taxes and fees, permits, subsidies). Although all regulatory standards 
  have consequences upon economic decision making, they differ from market-based 
  instruments, which operate by directly changing relative prices rather than 
  by specifying technology or performance outcomes.</p>
<p>Regulatory standards can be effective policies to address market failures and 
  barriers associated with information, organization, and other transactions costs. 
  They also are widely used to require actors to account for environmental externalities 
  and, if continually modified to account for technical progress, they can provide 
  dynamic innovation incentives (see <a href="261.htm">Section 6.5.3</a>). The 
  principal sources of inefficiency associated with some regulatory standards 
  derive from too narrow specifications of uniform behaviour in heterogeneous 
  situations, weakness in controlling aggregate levels of pollution, and relatively 
  more difficult application to products other than component or turnkey technologies. 
  By requiring a certain level of performance without specifying how it should 
  be achieved, performance standards generally reduce losses through inflexibility 
  when compared to technology standards.</p>
<p>On the whole, energy efficiency standards have proved to be an effective energy 
  conservation policy tool. Energy efficiency standards are widely used in over 
  50 nations and the number of standards is still growing.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#26","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>26</sup></small></a> 
  <small><sup>,</sup></small><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#27","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>27</sup></small></a> 
  <small><sup>,</sup></small><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#28","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>28</sup></small></a> 
  For appliance standards enacted in the USA, cumulative energy savings in 1990 
  to 2010 are estimated at 24 etajoules (EJ), consumer life-cycle costs savings 
  at US$46 billion, and emission reductions at about 400MtCO<sub>2</sub>. For 
  an early estimate, see McMahon (1992). The introduction of refrigerator and 
  freezer standards in the EU is estimated to generate 300 TeraWatt hours (TWh) 
  of cumulative electricity savings during 1995 to 2010 (Lebo and Szabo, 1996). 
  Similar measures in Central and Eastern Europe are expected to save 60 TWh energy 
  and to reduce emissions by 25 MtCO<sub>2</sub> (Bashmakov and Sorokina, 1996). 
  In Japan, the law concerning the rational use of energy was strengthened on 
  1 April 1999 and is expected to reduce, in combination with the industries&#146; 
  voluntary actions plan, a maximum of 140 MtCO<sub>2</sub> in industry, transportation, 
  and other sectors in total (Yamaguchi, 2000). Energy efficiency standards are 
  especially effective in countries with high and growing appliance ownership 
  and in countries in which consumers&#146; energy awareness is low because of 
  historically low energy prices.</p>
<p>The development of an effective regulatory standard requires national and, 
  potentially, international, leadership to balance the interests of manufacturers, 
  consumers, environmental non-government organizations (NGOs), and other interest 
  groups, while creating sufficient societal support and incentives for successful 
  implementation. While decisions to introduce regulatory standards are commonly 
  made by legislatures, the development and implementation of standards over time 
  is often left to a less transparent public administration. Although the enforcement 
  and monitoring of all policy instruments is costly and subject to failures, 
  including discriminatory treatment and corruption, social science literature 
  that examines the implementation of regulatory standards is more extensive.</p>
<p>Recent literature indicates that regulatory standards often precede market-based 
  instruments and build institutional capacity in policy evaluation, monitoring, 
  and enforcement (Legro <i>et al</i>., 1999). This is especially true in developing 
  countries that lack both trained personnel and the financial resources to implement 
  market-based instruments.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#29","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>29</sup></small></a> 
  Technology standards have provided the initial training ground for public officials 
  unfamiliar with any approach to environmental regulation. Russell and Powell 
  (1996) found that developing countries with a better institutional capacity 
  developed through experience with regulatory standards generally are more successful 
  in implementing market-based environmental policies than less well-equipped 
  countries. Cole and Grossman (1998) suggest that when historical, technological, 
  and institutional contexts are taken into account, technology standards are 
  efficient in the initial stages of environmental policy development.</p>
<p>The use of regulatory standards to force the internalization of environmental 
  costs has initial distributional consequences different from those of environmental 
  taxes or subsidies.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#30","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>30</sup></small></a> 
  Regulatory standards reduce economic benefits previously shared by consumers, 
  capital, and labour only to the extent of compliance costs and/or output foregone. 
  Unlike environmental taxes or auctioned permits, regulatory standards do not 
  extract the value of environmental costs on inframarginal production that continues 
  after the policy is mandated.</p>
<p>Regulatory standards may also be used to correct barriers that arise from information 
  failures and can yield net benefits to society if the costs associated with 
  the regulation are less than the losses due to informational barriers. </p>
