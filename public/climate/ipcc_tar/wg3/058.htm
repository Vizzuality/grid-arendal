<h3><a name="132"></a>1.3.2 What Are the Options? </h3>
<p>These considerations have given rise to a variety of solutions, both in the 
  evolving climate agreements and in the scholarly literature. This literature 
  classifies options in terms of the underlying theoretical and philosophical 
  approaches to equity. Toth (1999) constructs a useful taxonomy of perspectives 
  on equity. We have modified this taxonomy slightly into four alternative views, 
  based on: rights, liability, poverty, and opportunity. A number of perspectives 
  on equity are discussed more fully in <a href="379.htm">Chapter 10</a>. </p>
<p><i>Rights-based</i>, that is based on equal (or otherwise defensible) rights 
  to the global commons.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#11","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>11</sup></small></a> 
  The earliest formulation of this approach was as a proposal for tradable permits 
  (see, e.g., Agarwal and Narain, 1991a; Parikh et al., 1991; Grubb, 1989; Ghosh, 
  1993). A formulation that carries this insight to its logical conclusion is 
  that of &#147;contraction and convergence&#148; (Meyer, 1999), whereby net aggregate 
  emissions decline to zero, and per capita emissions of Annex I and non-Annex 
  I countries reach precise equality. Initial analysis assumed an equal per capita 
  allocation of emission permits&#150;or rights to the &#147;atmospheric commons&#148;&#150;but 
  subsequent questioning led other writers to explore equity and efficiency implications 
  of alternative allocation formulas, including geographical area, historic use, 
  economic activity, or some combination of these. In all this literature, the 
  idea is that &#147;surplus&#148; countries or regions, namely those (mainly 
  among non-Annex I countries) with per capita emissions below their total allocation, 
  could sell excess emissions rights to &#147;deficit&#148; countries, namely 
  those (mainly among the Annex I countries) that exceed their quota. Besides 
  a transfer from rich to poor countries, this scheme provided incentives to both 
  groups to reduce their emissions&#150;at least as long as emissions rights are 
  a scarce commodity&#150;to reap the financial benefits of conservation. In other 
  words, it sought simultaneously to reward restraint, punish profligacy, provide 
  incentives for conservation, induce a transfer from rich countries to poor ones, 
  and thus lead to distributional equity, efficiency, and sustainability.</p>
<p><i>Liability-based</i>, that is based on the right of people not to be harmed 
  by others&#146; actions without suitable compenzation (see Rayner et al., 1999).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#12","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>12</sup></small></a> 
  This literature focuses on the damage caused by overuse of the commons, and 
  seeks to establish mechanisms through which those who cause such damage are 
  penalized and the victims of the damage compensated. This perspective opens 
  up possibilities of financial instruments, such as insurance, which distribute 
  risk across society. Countries or groups that believe that the risk of harm 
  is overstated could offer insurance to others against the liability (Sagar and 
  Banuri, 1999). In other words, this solution is expected to lead to sustainability 
  (incentive for restraint) and procedural (though not necessarily distributional) 
  equity. However, broadly speaking, the climate negotiations have not taken this 
  route in any significant manner.</p>
<p><i>Poverty-based</i>, that is based on the need to protect the poor and vulnerable 
  against the impact of climate change as well as climate policy. Roughly 2 billion 
  people in the world exist at levels of consumption that, from the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions perspective, do not pose a threat to the climate (although their lifestyles 
  are a threat to their own survival).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#13","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>13</sup></small></a> 
  Unlike the high-technology sectors of the developed as well as developing countries, 
  the poor and vulnerable communities lack the flexibility to adapt to global 
  changes or global agreements. Options based on this approach include investment 
  in capacity building and protection for the poor and vulnerable groups to enable 
  them to enhance their livelihoods in an emerging climate regime, while setting 
  aggregate emission targets for the rest of the world. This could also involve 
  a transition to renewable energy in the developing countries, which is generally 
  consistent with the sustainable livelihoods perspective, especially since the 
  current menu of renewable energy technologies includes many that are small scale 
  and appropriate for scattered and low-income populations. Elements of this solution 
  are contained in Agenda 21, but it has not otherwise played a prominent role 
  in discussions of global climate regimes or global governance&#150;except for 
  the occasional reference to intranational equity (see, e.g., Rayner and Malone, 
  2000).</p>
<p><i>Opportunity-based</i>, that is based on the right of people, not to the 
  global commons per se, but to the opportunity to achieve a standard of living 
  enjoyed by those with greater access to the commons (see e.g., Najam, 2000). 
  It has strong overlaps with the compromise solution that is emerging from the 
  negotiations. Its exclusive focus is on the relationship between states, and 
  it has led to agreements that place the burden of adjustment primarily on Annex 
  I countries. It also implies a tacit consensus on such matters as: </p>
<ul>
  <li>no large financial transfers or windfall gains;</li>
  <li> no sudden shocks, but a gradual approach consistent with the coping capacity 
    of different countries;</li>
  <li> no financial burden on non-Annex I countries; and</li>
  <li>no restrictions on the space for sustainable development, particularly in 
    the developing countries. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
