<h3>8.4.5 Critical Factors Affecting the Timing of Emissions Reductions: The Role 
  of Technological Change</h3>
<p>As pointed out by Grubb (1997), there are several key assumptions imbedded 
  in the energy-economy models that influence the shape of the least-cost mitigation 
  pathway. For a pre-determined target, these relate to the determinants of technical 
  change; capital stock turnover and the inertia in the energy system; discounting; 
  and, the carbon cycle. When the target is uncertain, they include in addition 
  the probability attached to each target and risk aversion (see <a href="379.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>) which tend to favour a more aggressive departure from current trends.</p>
<p>The discount rate will not be discussed because it is less important in cost-efficiency 
  frameworks (when the target is pre-determined) than in a cost-benefit one (when 
  the discount rate reduces the weight of future environmental impacts, see <a href="379.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>). Neither are the very few studies discussed which try to assess different 
  benefits in terms of environmental co-benefits of reducing GHG emissions presented. 
  Wigley <i>et al.</i> (1996), for example, show pathway-related differentials 
  up to 0.2&deg;C in global mean temperature and 4cm in global mean sea-level 
  (by 2100) for the WGI and WRE 550 stabilization pathways. See <a href="379.htm">Chapter 
  10</a> for an elaboration of these timing issues. This part will rather insist 
  on the key features of technical change that are numerically of utmost importance. 
</p>
<p>To the extent that the cost of reducing emissions is lower in the future than 
  at present, the overall cost of stabilizing the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  is less if emissions mitigation is shifted towards the future. This shift occurs 
  in all models. The extent of the shift that minimizes the cost of limiting the 
  concentration of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> depends, at least in part, on the 
  treatment of technological change. Without technological change, the problem 
  is simple and the results of Hotelling (1939) apply. With endogenous technological 
  change, the problem becomes more complex.</p>
<p>This discussion of the determinants of technological change must begin with 
  the acknowledgement that no adequate theory of endogenous technological change 
  exists at present. Many researchers have contributed to the field, but the present 
  state of understanding is such that present knowledge is partial and not necessarily 
  fully consistent. Although no complete theory of technological change exists, 
  two elements have been identified and explored in the literature: induced technological 
  change (ITC) and learning-by-doing (LBD). Work by Ha-Duong <i>et al.</i> (1997), 
  Grubb <i>et al.</i> (1995), Grubb (1997), and Kypreos and Barreto (1999) examined 
  the implication of ITC, LBD, and inertia within the context of uncertainty and 
  an imperative to preserve the option of concentration ceilings such as 450ppmv. 
  They conclude that emissions mitigation can be shifted from the future towards 
  the present under appropriate circumstances.</p>
<p>Goulder and Mathai (1998) also explore how the effect on timing depends on 
  the source of technological change. When the channel for technological change 
  is R&amp;D, ITC makes it preferable to concentrate more abatement efforts in 
  the future. The reason is that technological change lowers the costs of future 
  abatement relative to current abatement, making it more cost-effective to place 
  more emphasis on future abatement. However, when the channel for technological 
  change is LBD, the presence of ITC acts in two opposite directions. On the one 
  hand, ITC makes future abatement less costly but, on the other hand, there is 
  an added value to current abatement because such abatement contributes to experience 
  or learning and helps reduce the costs of future abatement. Which of these two 
  effects dominates depends on the particular nature of assumptions and firms. 
  In recent years, there has been a good deal of discussion about the potential 
  for ITC (e.g., Anderson <i>et al.,</i> 1999). Proponents argue that such changes 
  might substantially lower, and perhaps even eliminate, the costs of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  abatement policies. These discussions have exposed very divergent views as to 
  whether technological change can be induced at no cost, or whether a resource 
  cost is involved. For example, in a 1995 article, Porter and van der Linde (1995) 
  contend that properly designed regulation can trigger innovation that may partially 
  or more than fully offset the costs of compliance. Indeed, they argue that firms 
  can actually benefit from more stringent regulation than that faced by their 
  competitors in other countries. However, in an accompanying article, a strongly 
  contrary view is put forward by Palmer<i> et al. </i>(1995). Examining available 
  data, they found that such offsets pale in comparison to expenditures for pollution 
  abatement and control.</p>
<h4><a name="8451"></a>8.4.5.1 ITC through Dedicated R&amp;D </h4>
<p>Including R&amp;D driven ITC in climate mitigation models leads to ambiguous 
  results in terms of time profile and tax level in a cost-benefit framework In 
  a cost-effectiveness framework, the optimal tax is lower in the case with R&amp;D 
  driven ITC and has to be set up early even if the effective resulting abatement 
  shifts from the near-term to the more distant future. If there are market failures 
  in the R&amp;D market (e.g., knowledge spillover), then subsidies for R&amp;D 
  are justified as it enhances social welfare and raises the abatement level (Goulder 
  and Schneider, 1999; Weyant and Olavson, 1999; Goulder and Mathai, 2000).</p>
<p>However, R&amp;D driven-ITC can reduce the gross costs of a carbon tax under 
  special circumstances. Specifically, if R&amp;D has been substantially over-allocated 
  towards the fossil fuel industries prior to the imposition of a carbon tax, 
  the carbon tax can reduce this allocative inefficiency and, as a result, its 
  costs can be quite low or even negative. A substantial prior misallocation towards 
  carbon-intensive industries could occur if there were prior subsidies towards 
  R&amp;D in the fossil fuel industries (with no comparable subsidies in other 
  industries), or if there were substantial positive spillovers from R&amp;D in 
  non-carbon industries (with no comparable spillovers in the fossil fuel industries). 
  Under other plausible initial conditions, however, R&amp;D driven-ITC raises, 
  rather than lowers, the net social costs of a given carbon tax because of the 
  crowding out of R&amp;D from other sectors; to put it clearly the tax level 
  for a given abatement is lower than under the hypothesis of exogenous technical 
  change and part of this decrease is offset when all the general equilibrium 
  effects are accounted. </p>
<p>The same model has been employed to compare the costs of achieving a given 
  abatement target through carbon taxes and R&amp;D subsidies (Schneider and Goulder, 
  1997; Goulder and Schneider, 1999). If there are no spillovers to R&amp;D, the 
  least-cost way to reach a given abatement target is through a carbon tax alone. 
  The carbon tax best targets the externality from the combustion of fossil fuels 
  related to climate change, and thus is the most cost-effective. However, if 
  there are spillovers to R&amp;D, the least-cost way to achieve a given abatement 
  target is through the combination of a carbon tax and R&amp;D subsidy. If spillovers 
  are present, there is a market failure in the R&amp;D market as well as a (climate 
  change related) market failure associated with the use of carbon. Two instruments 
  (the R&amp;D subsidy and the carbon tax) are needed to address the two distinct 
  market failures most efficiently. In general, a R&amp;D subsidy by itself does 
  not offer the least-cost approach to reducing carbon emissions. Results from 
  this model are highly sensitive to assumptions about the nature and extent of 
  knowledge spillovers. Further empirical work that sheds light on these spillovers 
  would have considerable value.<br>
