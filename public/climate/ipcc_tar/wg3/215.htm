<h3>5.4.5 Agriculture </h3>
<p>The Special Report on Land use, Land-use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 2000a) 
  estimated a significant potential for increasing carbon stocks in the agricultural 
  sector. Improved management of cropland and grazing-lands, agroforestry, and 
  rice paddies have the potential to sequester 398 MtC annually, and the conversion 
  of cropland to agroforestry practices and grasslands can sequester an additional 
  428 MtC annually by 2010. These estimates are highly uncertain, however, and 
  do not include the impact on the net emissions of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) or 
  nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) from agricultural practices or wetlands and/or 
  permafrost management. </p>
<p>CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from agriculture produce about eight per cent of the 
  radiative forcing of all GHGs (Watson <i>et al</i>., 1996). CH<sub>4</sub> from manure 
  can be captured and used for fuel; emissions from ruminants can be reduced with 
  better diets, feed additives, and breeding; and emissions from rice paddies 
  can be mitigated by nutrient management, water management, altered tillage practices, 
  cultivar selection, and other practices (Mosier <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>Many of the mitigation options to address these opportunities may provide multiple 
  benefits to the farmer and society at large. Improving soil management for crop 
  production, for instance, can also improve water relations, nutrient retention, 
  and nutrient cycling capacity (Paustian <i>et al</i>., 1998). Retiring surplus agricultural 
  lands can result in improved water quality, reduced soil erosion, and increased 
  wildlife habitat. As Izac (1997) points out, however, farmers, who will be the 
  ultimate decision makers about which mitigation option to adopt, have shorter 
  planning horizons than national or international beneficiaries, and many mitigation 
  options ask them to bear costs up front while the benefits are longer term and 
  to the society at large. </p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to realize these opportunities a very large proportion 
  of farmers who pursue diverse agricultural practices will have to be convinced 
  to adopt mitigation options. Economic, cultural, and institutional barriers 
  exist which restrict the rate of adoption of such practices. Farmers who are 
  accustomed to traditional practices may be reluctant to adopt new production 
  systems. Crop price supports, scarcity of investment capital, and lack of economic 
  incentives for addressing environmental externalities are some of the economic 
  barriers. Limited applicability of mitigation options to different types of 
  agriculture, negative effects on yield and soil fertility for rice production, 
  and the increased skilled labour requirements are some of the other constraints. 
  Among these barriers the especially critical ones are highlighted here. </p>
<p><i>Farm-level Adoption Constraints</i><b> </b><br>
  Several generic constraints characterize the adoption of most new agricultural 
  technology. These include small farm size, credit constraints, risk aversion, 
  lack of access to information and human capital, inadequate rural infrastructure 
  and tenurial arrangements, and unreliable supply of complementary inputs. Participatory 
  arrangements that fully engage all the involved actors may help to overcome 
  many of these barriers.</p>
<p><i>Government Subsidies</i><b> </b><br>
  Subsidies for critical inputs to agriculture, such as fertilizers, water supply, 
  and electricity and fuels, and to outputs in order to maintain stable agricultural 
  systems and an equitable distribution of wealth can distort markets for these 
  products. These types of subsidies prevail in both developed and developing 
  countries. Low electricity prices in India, for example, provide a disincentive 
  for the use of efficient pump sets, and encourage increased use of ground water, 
  which depletes the water reservoirs. In the OECD, for example, high levels of 
  farm subsidies have also contributed to the intensification of farm practices 
  and often provide incentives to increase fertilizer use, livestock density, 
  etc. (Storey, 1997).</p>
<p><i>Lack of National Human and Institutional Capacity and Information in the 
  Developing Countries</i><b> </b><br>
  Several of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) 
  systems are experiencing difficulty as their funding slows. The systems have 
  not transferred capacity to national centres in the developing countries that 
  they are expected to serve. The national centres also lack access to information, 
  and are not aware of technologies that suit their local conditions (IPCC, 2000b). 
</p>
<p><i>Intellectual Property Rights</i><b> </b><br>
  To some extent the reduced public funding on new technologies has been replaced 
  by the private sector&#146;s contribution. Private sector funding offers one 
  approach to increasing investment for mitigation projects worldwide. Private 
  plant breeding research has more than quadrupled in the USA in real terms between 
  1970 and 1990. Its international role is, however, controversial. Protection 
  of intellectual property rights is weak, especially for commercially developed 
  seed varieties (Deardorff, 1993; Frisvold and Condon, 1995, 1998; Knudson, 1998). 
  On the other hand, hybridization will help to stimulate more investment from 
  the private sector at the risk of increasing the farmers&#146; dependency on 
  the annual purchase of new seeds. There are also concerns that genetic resources 
  that have not been considered as privately-owned intellectual property may get 
  patented worldwide by private investors. </p>
<p>Several measures may be pursued to address the above barriers. These include</p>
<ul>
  <li> The expansion of internationally supported credit and savings schemes, 
    and price support, to assist rural people to manage the increased variability 
    in their environment (Izac, 1997);</li>
  <li>Shifts in the allocation of international agricultural research for the 
    semi-arid tropics towards water-use efficiency, irrigation design, irrigation 
    management, and salinity, and the effect of increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels 
    on tropical crops (Tiessen <i>et al</i>., 1998);</li>
  <li>The improvement of food security and disaster early warning systems, through 
    satellite imaging and analysis, national and regional buffer stocks, improved 
    international responses to disasters, and linking disaster food-for-work schemes 
    to adaptation projects (e.g., flood barricades);</li>
  <li>The development of institutional linkage between countries with high standards 
    in certain technologies, for example flood control; and </li>
  <li>The rationalization of input and output prices of agricultural commodities 
    taking DES issues into consideration which would lead to more efficient use 
    of input resources.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
