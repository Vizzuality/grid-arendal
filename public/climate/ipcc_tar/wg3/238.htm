<h4>6.2.2.4 Voluntary Agreements </h4>
<p>No international definition of a VA is universally accepted (CEC, 1996; EEA, 
  1997; OECD, 1998a). VA is used here to mean an agreement between a government 
  authority and one or more private parties, as well as a unilateral commitment 
  that is recognized by the public authority, to achieve environmental objectives 
  or to improve environmental performance beyond compliance.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#49","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>49</sup></small></a></p>
<p>VAs may take a wide variety of different forms. The large-scale VAs in the 
  field of GHG mitigation activities in Japan and the Netherlands are referred 
  to in <a href="#box63">Boxes 6.3</a> and <a href="#box64">6.4</a>. For a description 
  of the US &#147;market transformation&#148; type VA and the German VAs, see 
  Mazurek (1998) and Storey <i>et al</i>. (1999), and Eichhammer and Jochem (1998), respectively. 
  Sometimes these involve agreements between the government and a set of firms, 
  but in other cases industry associations represent member firms. Sometimes the 
  agreement only relates to general issues, such as R&amp;D activities, reporting 
  on emissions, or energy efficiency, but in other cases specific quantified targets, 
  such as emissions targets, are agreed upon. A few VAs are legally binding once 
  signed, but most are not.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#50","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>50</sup></small></a></p>
<p>Although VAs are a relatively new environmental policy instrument, they are 
  gaining popularity as a tool to cope with environmental issues. That in 1996 
  in the EU alone there existed more than 300 VAs at least suggests this type 
  of policy measure is administratively and politically feasible, especially if 
  it is used in a policy mix or in new policy areas (OECD, 1998a, p. 102). VAs 
  are political feasible simply because most of the industries seem to prefer 
  VAs over other tools (Dijkstra, 1998; Svendsen, 1999). VAs may precede more 
  formal arrangements; the vast majority of GHG emissions reductions in the USA 
  called for in the US Climate Change Action Plan come, for instance, from voluntary 
  initiatives to increase energy efficiency. However, VAs may not be a satisfactory 
  substitute for mandatory efficiency standards (Krause, 1996).</p>
<p>Sometimes the &#147;voluntary&#148; aspect of a VA is questioned, as the main 
  motivation for industries to join the VA was to avoid the implementation of 
  a carbon and/or energy tax and/or other mandatory policy (Torvanger and Skodvin. 
  1999, p. 28). Segerson and Miceli (1997) found that the level of abatement under 
  a VA is closely related to the probability of regulatory action in the absence 
  of an agreement.</p>
<p>Proponents of voluntary approaches point to the low transaction costs, the 
  merits of the consensus elements in the approach, and the advantages of leaving 
  the choice of abatement measures to the participants. Although free riding is 
  a concern with VAs, the risk can be addressed through the proper design of the 
  VA. Free riding can take place if firms that do not comply or participate benefit 
  from the agreement while bearing no cost. Governments may encourage participation 
  in VA programmes and discourage free riders by providing incentives such as 
  permits to use labels and other marketing claims. As for possible abuse, some 
  or all of the participants may use their initiating role in the process to create 
  an agreement that benefits them, and hence obstruct real abatement progress. 
  It could also involve introducing measures that benefit some firms, and reinforces 
  their market dominance.</p>
<p>To assess the environmental effectiveness, the trade-off between how ambitious 
  the objectives are and how well they are attained should be recognized. There 
  is a suspicion that if the goals are too ambitious, they will not be attained. 
  As most VAs are non-binding they may not attain ambitious goals (EEA, 1997; 
  OECD, 1998a). VA objectives may be less stringent if environmental groups are 
  left out off the negotiation process. Since VAs are a relatively new policy 
  instrument to cope with environmental issues, it is too early to determine their 
  effectiveness (OECD, 1998a, pp. 78&#150;83).</p>
<p>From a methodological perspective, it is rather complex to assess the effectiveness 
  of VAs because it is difficult to establish a counterfactual.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#51","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>51</sup></small></a></p>

      <p><b>Box 6.3. Keidanren Voluntary Action Plan on the Environment</b> (See 
        http://www.keidanren.or.jp/)</p>
      <p>Keidanren (Japan Federation of Economic Organizations), the largest private 
        and non-profit economic organization in Japan, announced the &#147;Keidanren 
        Appeal on the Environment&#148; in 1996, in which concrete courses of 
        action for measures to cope with global warming were specified. Following 
        the Appeal, 37 trade associations set forth the &#147;Keidanren Voluntary 
        Action Plan on the Environment&#148; in June 1997. Although the above 
        action plan is a unilateral commitment on the part of the industries, 
        it should be considered an environmental agreement.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#52","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>52</sup></small></a> 
        In fact it constitutes a major component of the Japanese government&#146;s 
        &#147;Basic Principles for the Promotion of Measures Dealing with Global 
        Warming&#148;; a follow-up survey is to be conducted every year and reported 
        to the government councils, including the Industrial Structure Council 
        of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, for third party review.</p>
      <p>This action plan, which contributes to meeting the Japanese commitment 
        under the Kyoto Protocol, has as its goal &#147;to endeavour to reduce 
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the 28 industrial and energy-conversion 
        sectors to below the levels of 1990 by 2010.&#148; Under a baseline (or 
        business-as-usual) scenario these emissions are estimated to increase 
        by 10%. The 28 sectors represent approximately 76% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
        generated by all industry and energy-conversion sectors in Japan, which 
        in turn generated 42% of Japan&#146;s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 
        1990.</p>
      <p>Each participating business sector made a social commitment by setting 
        a numerical target (in terms of: size of CO<sub>2</sub> or energy consumption; 
        emissions or index of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; or energy input per unit 
        output), which was compiled and published by Keidanren. For example, the 
        Japanese Iron and Steel Federation set a target of reducing energy consumption 
        in 2010 by 10% from the 1990 level (57.22kt crude oil).</p>
      <p>The second survey, presented just before CoP5, showed that CO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions in fiscal year 1998 were 126MtC, or 2.4% less than 1990 and 
        6% less than 1997 levels. Keidanren stressed that to meet the emissions 
        goal it would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>continue to make annual surveys of emissions by participating associations;<br>
        </li>
        <li>intensify co-operation between the government and other sectors, such 
          as transportation, households, etc.;<br>
        </li>
        <li>promote the construction of new nuclear power plants; and<br>
        </li>
        <li>explore positively the utilization of the Kyoto mechanisms. </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Voluntary provisions also may accompany mandatory policies. The Substitution 
  Provision of the US Acid Rain (SO2 Emissions Trading) Program is the first example 
  of a voluntary compliance provision within an emissions trading regime.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#53","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>53</sup></small></a> 
  Voluntary compliance was characterized by adverse selection; units that &#147;opted 
  in&#148; to the programme tended either to have low emissions below their permitted 
  allocations, or to have low costs of abatement (Montero, 1999). While the VA 
  kept aggregate costs low, the adverse selection increased aggregate emissions 
  (Montero, 1999). This inevitable trade-off between adverse selection and cost-savings 
  means that the design of voluntary programmes will influence their net emissions 
  impact (Montero, 2000a).</p>
<p>The OECD (1998a) noted that no empirical evidence is available on the cost-effectiveness 
  of VAs. CEC (1996), however, argues that the flexibility of VAs provides room 
  for industries to find the most efficient way to achieve the targets, which 
  could be a major advantage. EEA (1997) recently concluded, after analyzing six 
  case studies of European VAs, that, while there was quantitative evidence for 
  environmental improvement in most case studies, more sophisticated analysis 
  would be necessary to distinguish between the effects of the VAs and those of 
  other factors (EEA, 1997, pp. 84&#150;85). In the same study it was recognized, 
  however, that in five of the six cases the interviewed experts felt VAs incurred 
  lower costs than alternative instruments.</p>
<p>OECD has indicated various conditions under which VAs can be implemented most 
  effectively (EEA, 1997, p. 15; OECD, 1998a):</p>
<ul>
  <li>clear targets are set prior to the agreement;<br>
  </li>
  <li>the agreement specifies the baseline against which improvements will be 
    measured;<br>
  </li>
  <li>the agreement specifies reliable and clear monitoring and reporting mechanisms;<br>
  </li>
  <li>technical solutions are available to reach the agreed target;<br>
  </li>
  <li>costs of complying with the VA are limited and are relatively similar for 
    all members of the target group; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>third parties are involved in the design and application of VAs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The EC, for instance, recommends prior consultation with interested parties, 
  a binding form, quantified and staged objectives, the monitoring of results, 
  and so on.</p>

    <td class="box"><b>Box 6.4. Voluntary Agreements in the Netherlands </b> 
      <p>In the early 1990s, the Dutch government entered into agreements with 
        all energy-intensive industries to improve energy efficiency. The purpose 
        was both to improve competitiveness by cutting energy costs and to reduce 
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This win&#150;win situation is favoured by the 
        Ministry of Economic Affairs, which was primarily responsible for the 
        execution of the long-term agreement (LTA) policy. Efficiency is usually 
        defined as the ratio of relevant physical output to primary energy consumed. 
        The target for most sectors is to improve energy efficiency by 20% in 
        2000, compared to 1989. Most sectors were audited before entering into 
        an agreement, to ensure that the efficiency improvement was feasible. 
        The coverage of industrial energy consumption is high, almost 90% when 
        non-energy consumption is excluded. There is a similar agreement with 
        the horticultural greenhouse sector, which is the second largest energy-consuming 
        sector after the chemical industry. An intermediate organization co-ordinates 
        the annual monitoring and runs programmes for technological support and 
        R&amp;D. The government publishes results annually. It is expected that, 
        on average, the 2000 efficiency target will be reached.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#54","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>54</sup></small></a> 
        Based on interviews and analysis, 30%&#150;50% of the efficiency improvement 
        identified is implemented because of LTA and related supporting policies 
        (Glasbergen <i>et al</i>., 1997). The results for the LTA sectors in total manufacturing 
        industry through 1996 are depicted in <a href="#fig61">Figure 6.1</a>, 
        together with general statistics (Van Dril, 2000).</p>
      <a name="fig61"></a>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>As a general observation, LTA results diverge from the actual average 
        of the entire manufacturing sector. Both the energy and output indicators 
        show significant deviations. The main explanations for the divergence 
        are, first, that energy-intensive products such as primary materials have 
        grown faster than average production value. In monitoring practice, there 
        may be some bias towards adjusting for energy-intensive products, to avoid 
        negative effects on efficiency results. A second explanation is that statistics 
        on the chemical industries are unreliable and that no insight is provided 
        by the entities responsible for monitoring. For example, no clear information 
        is available on the share of non-energy consumption and its impact on 
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
