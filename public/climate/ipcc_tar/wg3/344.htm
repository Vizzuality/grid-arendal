<h4>8.3.2.1 Impact of Emissions Trading </h4>
<p>All of the above studies considered various forms of emissions trading for 
  Annex I economies. It was universally found that most non-Annex I economies 
  that suffered welfare losses under uniform independent abatement also suffer 
  smaller welfare losses under emissions trading. This is also the case in all 
  of the studies for which results on movements in the terms of trade are published 
  (Coppel and Lee 1995; Harrison and Rutherford, 1999).</p>
<p>Why are overall welfare losses to non-Annex I regions reduced by emissions 
  trading? A key point is that because the marginal and average cost of abatement 
  for the aggregate Annex I is lower under emissions trading than under uniform 
  abatement, a higher GDP is achieved for a given reduction in emissions. This 
  means that the reduction in emissions is achieved through a heavier reliance 
  on substitution relative to output reduction (substitution involves the substitution 
  of less emission-intensive for more emission-intensive Annex I produced inputs). 
  The heavier reliance on substitution means that there is a less severe decline 
  in fossil fuel prices and a lower increase in the price of manufactured goods 
  that are fossil-fuel intensive. There is also less increase in non-Annex I exports 
  of fossil-fuel intensive manufactured goods to Annex I regions under emissions 
  trading than independent abatement. However, these increased exports divert 
  resources from activities in which the original non-Annex I comparative advantage 
  was higher and the overall result is less beneficial to most non-Annex I economies.</p>
<p>Some non-Annex I economies that experience welfare gains under independent 
  abatement also experience smaller gains under emissions trading; however, the 
  aggregate effect of emissions trading is found to be positive for non-Annex 
  I economies: those that suffer welfare losses under independent abatement suffer 
  smaller losses under emissions trading. </p>
<p>To summarize, despite a number of identifiable numerical discrepancies, there 
  is agreement that the mixed pattern of gains and losses under the Kyoto targets 
  results in a more positive aggregate outcome than under the assumed and more 
  stringent pre-Kyoto targets. Similarities in the regions that are identified 
  as gainers and losers are also quite marked. Oil-importing economies that rely 
  on energy-intensive exports are gainers (and more so if the exports&#146; carbon 
  intensity is low), economies that rely on oil exports experience losses, and 
  the results are more unstable for economies between these two extremes.</p>
<h4><a name="8322"></a>8.3.2.2 Effects of Emission Leakage on Global Emissions 
  Pathways</h4>
<p>As discussed above, a reduction in Annex I emissions tends to increase non-Annex 
  I emissions, reducing the environmental effectiveness of Annex I abatement. 
  Emissions leakage is measured as the increase in non-Annex I emissions divided 
  by the reduction in Annex I emissions.<br>
</p>
<p>A number of multiregional models have been used to estimate carbon leakage 
  rates (Martin <i>et al.</i> 1992; Pezzey 1992; Oliveira-Martins <i>et al.</i> 
  1992; Manne and Oliveira-Martins, 1994; Edmonds <i>et al.,</i> 1995; Golombek 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1995; Jacoby <i>et al.</i> 1997; Brown <i>et al</i>. 1999). In 
  SAR (IPCC, 1996, p. 425) a high variance in estimates of emission leakage rates 
  was noted; they ranged from close to zero (Martin<i> et al.</i> (1992) using 
  the GREEN model) to 70% (Pezzey (1992) using the Whalley&#150;Wigle model). 
  In subsequent years, some reduction in this variance has occurred, in the range 
  5%&#150;20%. This may in part arise from the development of a number of new 
  models based on reasonably similar assumptions and data sources, and does not 
  necessarily reflect more widespread agreement about appropriate behavioural 
  assumptions. However, because emission leakage is an increasing function of 
  the stringency of the abatement strategy, this may also be because carbon leakage 
  is a less serious problem under the Kyoto targets than under the targets considered 
  previously.</p>
<p>Technically, there is a clear correlation between the sign and magnitude of 
  spillover effects analyzed above and the magnitude of carbon leakage. It is 
  important, however, to recognize those parameters that have a critical influence 
  on results:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The assumed degree of substitutability between imports and domestic production. 
    This is why models based on the Armington assumption that imports and domestic 
    production are imperfect substitutes produces lower estimates of emission 
    leakage than models based on the assumption of perfect substitutability.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The ease of substitution among technologies with different emissions intensities 
    in the electricity and the iron and steel industries in Annex I regions.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The assumed degree of competitiveness in the world oil market; this issue 
    is considered in <a href="345.htm">Section 8.3.2.3</a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The existence of an international carbon-trading system: for a given abatement 
    strategy, emission leakage is lower under emissions trading than under independent 
    abatement. This conclusion flows logically from the discussion above on movements 
    in terms of trade. Greater Annex I output reduction under independent abatement 
    stimulates greater emission-intensive production in non-Annex I regions, through 
    both higher prices for emission intensive products and lower prices for fossil 
    fuels. Support for the above conclusions on the impact of emissions trading 
    is found in ABARE-DFAT (1995), Brown <i>et al. </i>(1997b), Hinchy <i>et al. 
    </i>(1998), Brown <i>et al.</i> (1999), McKibbin<i> et al. </i>(1999), Kainuma 
    <i>et al</i>. (1999), and Bernstein <i>et al.</i> (1999).</li>
