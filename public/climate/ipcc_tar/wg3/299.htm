<h4>7.4.2.4 Inflation </h4>
<p>Price levels are always changing to reflect changes in the relative scarcity 
  of inputs and other factors. However, when the overall cost of goods and services 
  increases in a certain period, then the economy faces inflation. Two aspects 
  of inflation need to be considered. First, for comparison at different points 
  in time an adjustment should be made for any general increase in the price level, 
  that is the comparisons should be made in real terms. The appropriate deflator 
  is a matter of judgement, but it should be based on a basket of goods consumed 
  by the relevant group of consumers in the country. Also, any such adjustments 
  do not preclude the possibility of increases in &#147;real prices&#148;. It 
  is quite possible that the costs and benefits attached to some impacts increase 
  slower (or faster) than the general price level.</p>
<p>The second issue relates to the welfare cost of any inflation generated by 
  the mitigation or adaptation activities. One of the main causes of inflation 
  is when a country incurs a fiscal deficit (i.e., public expenditures exceed 
  tax revenues) that is financed by printing money. Such an increase in inflation 
  is effectively a tax on money holdings, on assets denominated in nominal terms, 
  and on those with fixed money incomes. </p>
<p>The distributional consequences of the inflation tax are germane to the decision-making 
  process. There is no simple way, however, to estimate this welfare cost; doing 
  so requires sophisticated measurements of losses in the consumption level that 
  affect distinct income groups. Moreover, for most mitigation and adaptation 
  measures, the increase in inflation is likely to be quite small. Hence, in the 
  majority of cases it is sufficient to report any increase in inflation that 
  results from the climate change policy and use that information as a direct 
  element in the decision-making process.</p>
<h4><a name="7425"></a>7.4.2.5 Availability of Capital </h4>
<p>The capital costs of mitigation and adaptation programmes may be underestimated 
  if the true scarcity of capital is not reflected in the costs incurred by the 
  parties that implement the programme. This can arise if capital is &#147;rationed&#148;, 
  that is the demand for investment projects exceeds the supply. In such a situation 
  it is appropriate to apply a shadow price for capital,for the estimation of 
  which the World Bank (1991) and others have made estimates. This adjustment 
  is in addition to the adjustment for the marginal cost of public funds (<a href="297.htm">Section 
  7.4.2.2</a>). Moreover, when a shadow price for capital of greater than one 
  is applied, it acts to ration capital when the discount rate applied is low.</p>
<p>The above discussion assumes that the capital allocated to the project is free 
  to be used for any other project. What happens, however, if capital is not &#147;fungible&#148; 
  in this sense, but is made available by a donor or third party for the specific 
  purpose of implementing climate change programmes? In these circumstances the 
  assessment of the programme from the national viewpoint differs from its assessment 
  from the viewpoint of the third party. The national assessment could take the 
  shadow price of capital as zero if it genuinely could not be used for any other 
  purpose. If, however, there were a number of alternative projects to which the 
  capital could be allocated, a comparison between them should be based on a shadow 
  price of capital that reflects its scarcity relative to the investment opportunities 
  available. The party providing the finance, on the other hand, will have its 
  own set of alternative projects to which the capital could be allocated and 
  it may apply its own shadow price. The important point is that the evaluation 
  and ranking of projects from a domestic viewpoint may differ from their ranking 
  from a donor perspective. When rankings differ, a compromise is usually reached, 
  based on the relative bargaining strengths of the two parties.</p>
