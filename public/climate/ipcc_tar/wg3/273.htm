<p><a name="fig71"></a>The literature uses a number of terms to depict the associated 
  benefits and costs that arise in conjunction with GHG mitigation policies. These 
  include co-benefits, ancillary benefits, side benefits, secondary benefits, 
  collateral benefits, and associated benefits. In the current discussion, the 
  term &#147;co-benefits&#148; refers to the non-climate benefits of GHG mitigation 
  policies that are explicitly incorporated into the initial creation of mitigation 
  policies. Thus, the term co-benefits reflects that most policies designed to 
  address GHG mitigation also have other, often at least equally important, rationales 
  involved at the inception of these policies (e.g., related to objectives of 
  development, sustainability, and equity). In contrast, the term ancillary benefits 
  connotes those secondary or side effects of climate change mitigation policies 
  on problems that arise subsequent to any proposed GHG mitigation policies. These 
  include reductions in local and regional air pollution associated with the reduction 
  of fossil fuels, and indirect effects on issues such as transportation, agriculture, 
  land use practices, employment, and fuel security. Sometimes these benefits 
  are referred to as &#147;ancillary impacts&#148;, to reflect that in some cases 
  the benefits may be negative. From the perspective of policies to abate local 
  air pollution, GHG mitigation may be an ancillary benefit.</p>
<p><a href="#fig71">Figure 7.1</a> illustrates the generation of ancillary benefits 
  to GHG emission reduction policies.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#4","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>4</sup></small></a> 
  These policies operate through the economic and institutional system within 
  a country and lead to reductions in GHGs, changes in other pollutants, and mitigation 
  costs. Changes in GHG emissions in turn lead to changes in air and water pollution, 
  which ultimately extend throughout the environment and feed back into the economy. 
  Then, depending on baseline conditions, technologies, and institutions, such 
  as labour markets, tax systems, and existing environmental and other types of 
  regulations (represented by &#147;institutions&#148; in the economic system 
  box), these feedbacks may become:</p>
<ul>
  <li>environmental impacts (such as the value of changes in conventional air 
    or water pollution);<br>
  </li>
  <li>non-environmental impacts (such as the value of employment effects); and, 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>direct climate change impacts.</li>
</ul>
<p>There appear to be three classes of literature regarding the costs and benefits 
  of climate change mitigation:</p>
<ol>
  <li> literature that primarily looks at climate change mitigation, but that 
    recognizes there may be benefits in other areas;<br>
  </li>
  <li> literature that primarily focuses on other areas, such as air pollution 
    control, and recognizes there may be benefits in the area of climate mitigation; 
    and<br>
  </li>
  <li> literature that looks at the combination of policy objectives (climate 
    change and other areas) and looks at the costs and benefits from an integrated 
    perspective.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these classes of literature may have their own preferred terms, and 
  for class (3) it seems to be &#147;co-benefits&#148;. TAR acknowledges the relevance 
  of all three, yet specifically wants to make the case for an integrated approach, 
  linking climate change mitigation to the achievement of sustainable development 
  and other policy objectives. Therefore, in this report, the term &#147;co-benefits&#148; 
  is used only when speaking generically about the issue because of the limited 
  availability of literature. The term &#147;ancillary benefits&#148; is used 
  when addressing class (1) and (2) literature. Class (1) literature appears to 
  be the most extensive; it is this literature on the ancillary benefits of climate 
  change mitigation that is primarily covered in this section.</p>
<p>The discussion of ancillary impacts and/or co-benefits and costs, and the estimation 
  of these are closely related to the concept of external cost, which is discussed 
  below.</p>
