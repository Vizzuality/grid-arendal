<h2>A3.5 Aerosol Products</h2>
<a name="a351"></a> 
<h3>A3.5.1 Medical Applications</h3>
<p>Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) form a reliable and effective therapy for asthma 
  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>
<p>There are estimated to be 300 million patients with asthma and COPD worldwide. 
  Approximately 450-500 million MDIs are used annually worldwide with asthma prevalence 
  increasing as urbanization of developing countries continues. It is estimated 
  that 10,000 metric tons (tonnes) of CFC and 1000 tonnes of HFCs were used in 
  MDIs worldwide in 1998 (UNEP, 1998b, 1999b). HFC-based MDIs are essential for 
  the near-term CFC phaseout, because other available options, including dry powder 
  inhalers (DPIs) (single or multi-dose), nebulizers (hand held or stationary), 
  orally administered drugs (tablets, capsules, or oral liquids), and injectable 
  drugs, which are alternatives for not using CFCs or HFCs, cannot currently replace 
  CFC products for all patients (UNEP, 1999b). The transition to HFC MDIs began 
  in 1995, and approximately 5% in 1998 and 10% in 1999 contain HFC (UNEP, 1999b). 
  HFC-based MDIs and DPIs are expected to help minimize the use of CFCs by 2005 
  in developed countries, while providing essential medication for patients. Important 
  factors in the conversion to DPIs will include their acceptance by doctors, 
  patients, insurance companies, and medical authorities. </p>
<p>Assuming the complete phase-out of CFC MDIs and a continued growth rate in 
  demand for asthma and COPD treatment of 1.5%&#150;3.0%/yr, it is estimated that 
  HFC consumption and emissions will be 7,500 to 9,000t/yr &#150; about 3&#150;3.6MtC<sub>eq</sub> 
  in 2010 (UNEP, 1999b). </p>
<p>DPIs have been formulated successfully for many anti-asthma drugs. Dry powder 
  inhalers are an immediately available alternative free of CFCs and HFCs; however, 
  they are not a satisfactory alternative to the pressurized MDIs for some patients 
  with very low inspiratory flow (e.g., some small children and elderly people, 
  patients) with acute asthma attacks or with severe respiratory diseases, and 
  emergency-room patients. Use is likely to accelerate, particularly as they may 
  be more suitable for young children than the older DPIs (UNEP, 1999b). In Scandinavian 
  countries, government policies have led to greater use of DPIs than of MDIs 
  (IPCC/TEAP, 1999; UNEP, 1999b; March, 1998). </p>
<p>The abatement cost estimates to reduce future HFC emissions by replacing MDIs 
  with DPIs depend on the price of DPIs. The cost per equivalent dose varies between 
  products and countries, with some CFC-free MDIs being more expensive than CFC-based 
  MDIs and some DPIs more expensive than both CFC- and HFC-based MDIs (ARCF, 2000). 
  In Europe, prices are less as much as US$4 higher for a DPI than for a comparable 
  MDI (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000). It is estimated that, by 2010, the EU can 
  reduce HFC emissions by 30% at a cost of about US$460/tC<sub>eq</sub> and 50% 
  at about US$490/tC<sub>eq</sub> (March, 1998), which translates to a differential 
  cost of US$4 over MDIs; for one country in Europe there is no differential cost 
  (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000). It is not currently medically feasible to replace 
  MDIs by DPIs completely because approximately 25% of MDI use is for patients 
  who require medication be forced into their respiratory system (&Ouml;ko-Recherche, 
  1999).</p>

<h3>A3.5.2 Cosmetic, Convenience, and Technical Aerosol Propellants</h3>
<p>Global 1998 consumption and emissions of HFCs in non-medical aerosol products 
  was less than 15,000 tonnes (UNEP, 1998d) with two-thirds HFC-134a and one-third 
  HFC-152a &#150; less than 4MtC<sub>eq</sub>. Emissions of HFCs are projected 
  to not exceed 20,000 tonnes in 2010 (IPCC/TEAP, 1999) or about 5MtC<sub>eq</sub> 
  (calculated assuming equal emissions of HFC-134a and HFC-152a). HFCs have replaced 
  only about 2% of the aerosol product market that would have used CFCs had there 
  not been the Montreal Protocol (McFarland, 1999). Hydrocarbon, dimethyl ether 
  (DME), carbon dioxide, nitrogen propellants, and not-in-kind alternative products 
  have replaced the remaining 98% of projected demand.</p>
<p>HFCs are used in aerosol products primarily to comply with technical requirements 
  or environmental regulations. HFC-134a is the propellant of choice for products 
  that must be completely non-flammable. An example of HFC use based on a technical 
  requirement is non-flammable, far-reaching insecticide products used on high-voltage 
  power lines and transformers where workers cannot escape from wasps and hornets. 
  HFC-152a is the propellant of choice to replace hydrocarbon aerosol propellants 
  restricted in Southern California and in some applications where hydrocarbons 
  and dimethyl ether are too flammable but the flammability of HFC-152a is acceptable. 
  HFC-134a and HFC-152a are the propellants of choice for laboratory, analytical, 
  and experimental uses where chemical properties are important and flammability 
  may be a concern.</p>
<p>One source estimates that about 45% of HFC emissions from cosmetic and convenience 
  applications where flammability is an issue could be eliminated at a cost of 
  US$70/tC<sub>eq</sub> and about 70% could be eliminated at a cost of about US$130/tC<sub>eq</sub> 
  (March, 1998). </p>
<p>The aerosol product industry has every incentive to minimize HFC use. HFCs 
  cost more than other propellants and unnecessary HFC use has the potential to 
  re-ignite consumer boycotts like the CFC boycotts in the early 1970s that led 
  to national bans on certain cosmetic products. Boycotts could threaten sales 
  of all aerosol products because consumers may not be able to distinguish targetted 
  HFC products from acceptable hydrocarbon products (UNEP, 1999b). </p>
<p>A &#147;self-chilling beverage can&#148; was designed to achieve refrigeration 
  through the physics of expanding and emitting approximately 35&#150;75g of HFC-134a 
  directly to the atmosphere for every beverage can chilled. The inventing company 
  pledged not to manufacture or license the technology and to discourage its use, 
  the US government banned the use of HFCs in self-chilling beverage cans (US 
  Federal Register, 1999), and a number of HFC producers have stated publicly 
  that they will not supply such an application. However, self-chilling cans using 
  HFC-134a are marketed in at least one country and it is estimated that even 
  a small market penetration could substantially increase emissions of greenhouse 
  gases (US Federal Register, 1999). </p>
<p>The UNEP/TEAP HFC and PFC Task Force (UNEP, 1999b) developed principles to 
  guide the use of HFCs for aerosol products: </p>
<ul>
  <li> recommend HFCs be used only in applications where they provide technical, 
    safety, energy, or environmental advantage that are not achieved by not-in-kind 
    alternatives; and <br>
  <li> select the HFC compound with the smallest GWP that still meets the application 
    requirements. 
</ul>
<p>Application of these principles justifies the use of HFCs for some products 
  in some circumstances but these &#147;responsible use&#148; criteria are not 
  satisfied when not-in-kind alternatives are technically and economically suitable. 
  The above-mentioned study (UNEP, 1999b) includes detailed evaluation of alternatives 
  and substitutes for aerosol safety products (insecticides, boat horns, noise-makers), 
  cosmetic products (deodorants, hair sprays, shaving creams), convenience products 
  (room fresheners, dust blowers, tyre inflators, foam caulk, and insulation), 
  and novelty products (foam party streamers, pneumatic pellet and bait guns).</p>
