<h4>9.2.8.2 Passenger Cars<br>
</h4>
<p><a href="089.htm">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="098.htm">Section 3.4</a> discusses the status of low-GHG-emission 
  technology for passenger cars. This section will discuss the effects of mitigation 
  policies on the use of this technology and more generally on the use of passenger 
  cars.</p>
<p>Government policies aimed at reducing passenger car fuel use, such as the US 
  corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards, and the high tax placed on 
  gasoline in many countries, have been in place for many years. These policies 
  have been driven by two considerations: the cost of importing crude oil, and/or 
  the desire to improve local environmental quality. The auto industry has responded 
  to these policies with the introduction of successive generations of technology 
  to improve passenger car efficiency. However, total passenger car fuel use has 
  increased steadily as improvements in vehicle efficiency have been overwhelmed 
  by increases in car sizes and car traffic. The number of passenger cars in use 
  worldwide has risen from 193 to 477 million between 1970 and 1995, and total 
  kilometres travelled have risen from 2.6 to 7.0 trillion vehicle-kilometres 
  between 1970 and 1995 (OECD, 1997b). While growth in passenger car numbers has 
  slowed in OECD countries, it is expected to continue to rise at a rapid rate 
  in the rest of the world. Passenger car numbers in China are expected to increase 
  20-fold from 1995 to 2015 (Dargay and Gately, 1997). <br>
</p>
<p>Because gasoline is already taxed at a very high level in many countries, and 
  the cost of fuel is a small portion of the total cost of driving, even fairly 
  substantial increases in the cost of the fuel (as a GHG mitigation policy) may 
  have little impact on vehicle use. The net present cost to the consumer of a 
  tax equivalent to US$300/tC is approximately 5% of the capital cost of a typical 
  new vehicle, assuming an initial cost of US$20,000, 12,000 km/year, and a 10-year 
  life (IEA, 1997b). Furthermore, the users of company and/or government-provided 
  cars may not be responsive to the increase in fuel cost at all, a typical case 
  of principal-agent problem (see <a href="089.htm">Chapter 3</a> and <a href="224.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>).<br>
  <br>
  Initiatives to improve fuel economy continue, often with the express intention 
  of reducing GHG emissions. European car manufacturers have voluntarily agreed 
  to reduce the fuel consumption of new cars by 20% by 2010. In 1993, US car manufacturers 
  entered into a partnership for a new generation vehicle (PNGV) with the US government 
  aimed at developing a passenger car with triple the current fuel economy (to 
  about 80 miles per gallon), by 2004, with no increase in cost or loss of performance 
  compared with current vehicles. The incremental costs of these vehicles have 
  been estimated to be as low as $2,500/car (DeCicco and Mark, 1997) to as high 
  as more than $6,000/car (Duleep, 1997; OTA, 1995). Since these vehicles will 
  be designed to meet the emissions standards anticipated to be in effect when 
  they are produced, no ancillary local air pollution benefit is expected. <br>
</p>
<p>However, much of the increase in fuel efficiency may be taken up in increased 
  demand for fuel if the lower operating costs are translated into increased ownership 
  and use of vehicles. In addition, Dowlatabadi <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1996) find that increasing 
  fuel economy to 60 miles per gallon had little beneficial effect on urban ozone 
  concentration, and could decrease the safety of passenger cars unless offsetting 
  steps were taken. Wang <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1998) estimate the capital investment required 
  in the USA through to 2030 for fuel production and distribution to be (1) US$100bn 
  (1995$) or less if the fuel for PNGV cars is reformulated gasoline or diesel, 
  ethanol, methanol, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or liquefied natural gas (LNG); 
  (2) approximately US$150bn for di-methyl ether; and (3) in the order of US$500bn 
  for hydrogen. No estimate was made of the cost of applying this technology outside 
  the USA.<br>
</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics (BTCE, 1996) 
  examine the social costs of 16 measures to reduce GHG emissions from the transport 
  sector. In the longer term, five of these measures: (1) metropolitan road user 
  charges, (2) reduced urban public transport fares, (3) city-wide parking charges, 
  (4) labelling of new cars to inform buyers of their fuel efficiency, and (5) 
  shifting inter-capital freight from road to rail were found to be &#147;no regrets&#148; 
  options, i.e., they had zero or negative costs to society as a whole. Together 
  these measures could reduce emissions from the Australian transport sector by 
  about 5% to 10% of total projected emissions. A carbon tax on motor fuels and 
  accelerated introduction of fuel-saving technology for commercial vehicles are 
  no regrets measures if applied at a low level, but incurred positive social 
  costs if applied more broadly. Planting trees to offset transport emissions, 
  scrapping older cars, and accelerating the introduction of energy efficiency 
  technology for passenger cars and aircraft are found to be low-to-medium cost 
  measures. Scrapping older commercial vehicles, compulsory tuning of passenger 
  car engines twice a year, resurfacing highways, and increasing the use of ethanol 
  as a motor fuel are found to be high cost measures. <br>
</p>
<p>Many parts of the developing world are faced with severe environmental problems 
  caused in part by a rapid growth in the use of personal vehicles (scooters, 
  motor cycles, mopeds, and cars). Many of these vehicles are old and poorly maintained, 
  use two-stroke engines, and operate on inadequate road systems. The result is 
  traffic congestion, greater fuel consumption, and noise and air pollution that 
  degrade the urban environment. Bose (1998) finds that improving public transportation 
  to meet as much as 80% of travel demand, and promoting cleaner fuels and improved 
  engine technologies (i.e., phasing out two-stroke engines, increasing the share 
  of cars equipped with three-way catalytic converters, using unleaded gasoline, 
  electric vehicles, and vehicles fuelled with compressed natural gas) in six 
  Indian cities can significantly reduce both emissions and fuel consumption. 
  Total fuel savings for the six cities is 0.83mtoe (see <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' >footnote 
  3</a>) in 2010 to 2011, and automotive emissions are reduced 30%&#150;80% compared 
  with a baseline case.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="9283"></a>9.2.8.3 Freight Trucks, Rail, and Shipping </h4>
<p>Freight transportation has been growing rapidly as a result of the growth of 
  international merchandise trade, which has surpassed the growth in the world 
  economy over the last two decades (IEA, 1997b). EIA (1998) consider the impacts 
  of carbon fees to reduce US carbon emissions to 3% below 1990 levels, the amount 
  estimated by the US administration as necessary to meet its Kyoto Protocol commitments 
  when reductions in the emissions of other gases were taken into account. These 
  fees raise the cost of diesel fuel by US$0.68/gallon, but result in only a 4.9% 
  reduction in US freight truck travel, most of which is a result of lower economic 
  activity. US rail transport is projected to decline by 32%, largely as the result 
  of a 71% reduction in the demand for coal. The cost of marine fuel is projected 
  to rise by US$0.84/gallon, nearly twice the reference price, but domestic shipping 
  is projected to decline by only 10% (EIA, 1998).<br>
