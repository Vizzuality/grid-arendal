<h2>2.4 Global Futures Scenarios</h2>
<a name="241"></a> 
<h3>2.4.1 The Role of Global Futures Scenarios </h3>
<p>In contrast to the GHG emission scenarios discussed in <a href="073.htm#23">sections 
  2.3</a> and <a href="080.htm#25">2.5</a> of this chapter, &#147;global futures&#148; 
  scenarios do not specifically or uniquely consider GHG emissions. Instead, they 
  are more general &#147;stories&#148; of possible future worlds. Global futures 
  scenarios can complement the more quantitative emission scenario assessments, 
  because they consider several dimensions that elude quantification, such as 
  governance, social structures, and institutions, but which are nonetheless important 
  to the success of mitigation (and adaptation) policies and, more generally, 
  describe the nature of the future world.</p>
<p>In this assessment, the global futures scenario literature was reviewed to 
  achieve three objectives. First, it was consulted in order to determine the 
  range of possible future worlds that have been identified by futurists. This 
  aids climate change policy analysis by providing a range of potential futures 
  against which the robustness of policy instruments may be assessed.</p>
<p>Second, global futures scenarios were analyzed to determine whether they displayed 
  any relationships between the various scenario dimensions and GHG emissions. 
  Although these relationships are often based entirely on qualitative analysis, 
  they might nonetheless yield insights about the relationships between some dimensions, 
  especially those that are difficult to quantify, and emissions. </p>
<p>Third, global futures scenarios may provide a link between the more quantitative 
  emission scenarios and sustainable development issues. Global futures scenarios 
  generally provide good coverage of sustainable development issues, while the 
  quantitative emission scenarios generally provide only limited coverage of these 
  issues. Linking the global futures scenarios with the quantitative emission 
  scenarios therefore might also provide a link between the latter and sustainable 
  development issues.</p>

<h3>2.4.2 Global Futures Scenario Database</h3>
<p>An extensive review of the futures literature was conducted and, from this 
  review, a database of scenarios was constructed. This database contains 124 
  scenarios from 48 sources.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>10</sup></small></a> 
  Scenarios were selected which were global<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#11","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>11</sup></small></a>, 
  long-term, and multidimensional in scope. The scenarios consider timelines that 
  run from the base year to anywhere between 2010 and 2100. Most scenarios are 
  detailed and comprehensive depictions of possible future worlds, with descriptions 
  of the social, economic, and environmental characteristics of these worlds. 
  Others are less detailed but still describe more than one characteristic of 
  the future world. Some scenarios are derived from the authors&#146; judgement 
  about most likely future conditions. Others are part of sets of possible futures, 
  usually posited as alternatives to a reference case. Still others are normative 
  scenarios, in that they describe the authors&#146; visions of desirable future 
  worlds. </p>
<p>In general, the global futures scenarios provide few quantified projections, 
  although there are some notable exceptions such as CPB (1992), Meadows <i>et 
  al.</i> (1992), Duchin <i>et al.</i> (1996), Gallopin <i>et al.</i> (1997), 
  OECD (1997), Rotmans and de Vries (1997), Glenn and Gordon (1998), Nakicenovic 
  <i>et al.</i> (1998), and Raskin <i>et al.</i> (1998). Several scenarios explicitly 
  consider energy use, GHG emissions, and/or future climate change, but not all 
  of these provide numerical estimates of the relevant variables. These quantified 
  scenarios are different from the scenarios in the <a href="073.htm">previous 
  section</a> since they present quantifications of primarily narrative scenarios. 
  The basis of the scenarios in the <a href="073.htm">previous section</a> is 
  a purely quantitative analysis of emissions profiles without narrative description.</p>
