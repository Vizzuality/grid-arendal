<h4>7.3.2.2 Multiple Baseline Scenarios </h4>
<p>The above discussion identifies a number of reasons why the establishment of 
  a baseline case is very difficult and uncertain. There are some additional reasons 
  why this is so. The difficulty in predicting the evolution of development patterns 
  over the long term stems, in part, from a lack of knowledge about the dynamic 
  linkages between technical choices and consumption patterns and, in turn, how 
  these interact with economic signals and policies. Technology and consumption 
  patterns are endogenous, their direction being determined at least partly by 
  political decisions. There are also many general uncertainties that impact on 
  the establishment of a baseline case, for example political and social changes.</p>
<p>The above considerations further emphasize the need for work on the basis of 
  several alternative baseline scenarios characterized by different assumptions 
  regarding development patterns and innovation. This allows the mitigation or 
  adaptation assessments to create an estimate range for the costs associated 
  with very different development paths. Indeed, the range of emission levels 
  associated with alternative baseline scenarios could well be greater than the 
  difference between a certain baseline and the corresponding active policy case.</p>
<p>In reality, this can only provide a partial insight into the costs of climate 
  change. Despite the large disparities in cost estimates likely to arise through 
  the use of multiple baselines, they do allow the future to be framed within 
  a much wider analytical perspective. Using a number of different development 
  patterns is of particular importance to developing countries. Since the major 
  part of their infrastructure and energy systems is yet to be built, the spectrum 
  for future development is wider than in industrialized countries. A baseline 
  scenario approach that assumes current development trends to continue is therefore 
  not very useful in these countries (IPCC, 1996a, Chapter 8).</p>
<p>The scenarios of the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC, 2000a) 
  show that alternative combinations of driving-force scenario variables can lead 
  to similar levels and structure of energy use and land-use patterns. Hence for 
  a given scenario outcome, for example in terms of GHG emissions, alternative 
  pathways can lead to that outcome. The conclusion is therefore that one and 
  only one development path does not exist and studies preferably should include 
  multiple baseline scenarios that facilitate a sensitivity analysis of the key 
  scenario variables and assess the consequence of different development patterns.</p>
