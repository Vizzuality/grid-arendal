<h3>3.7.3 New Technological and Other Options</h3>
<a name="3731"></a> 
<h4>3.7.3.1 Landfill Management</h4>
<p>LFG capture and energy recovery is a frequently applied landfill management 
  practice. There have been many initiatives during the past few years to capture 
  and utilize LFG in gas turbines; a number of such facilities are currently generating 
  electricity. US regulations now require capture of an average of 40% of all 
  landfill methane nationwide. Yet even after compliance with those regulations, 
  it remains profitable (at a carbon price of zero or negative cost) to capture 
  52% of the landfill methane. At a price of US$20/tC<sub>eq</sub> (in 1996 dollars), 
  an additional 19% of the methane could be captured, an amount that approaches 
  the estimated maximum practical attainable level (US EPA, 1999a). Official estimates 
  suggest that approximately half, or 35MtC<sub>eq</sub>, of landfill methane 
  could be recovered by 2000.</p>
<p>Other studies have found that the methane yield from landfills is about 60-170 
  l/kg of dry refuse (El-Fadel <i>et al</i>., 1998). Some landfills produce electricity 
  from LFG by installing cost effective gas turbines or technologically promising, 
  but still expensive fuel cells (Siuru, 1997). Later reports dispute this claim 
  (US EPA, 2000).</p>
<p>One study suggests that landfilling of branches, leaves and newspaper sequesters 
  carbon even without LFG recovery, whereas food scraps and office paper produce 
  a net increase in GHGs, even from landfills with methane recovery (US EPA, 1998).</p>
<a name="3732"></a> 
<h4>3.7.3.2 Recycling</h4>
<p>Many programmatic initiatives and incentives can boost the rate of recycling. 
  The potential gains are quite large: if everyone in the USA increased from the 
  national average recycling rate to the per capita recycling rate achieved in 
  Seattle, Washington, the result would be a reduction of 4% of total US GHG emissions 
  (Ackerman, 2000). While often associated with affluent countries, recycling 
  is also an integral part of the informal economy of developing countries; innovative 
  approaches to recycling have been adopted in poor neighbourhoods of Curitiba, 
  Brazil, and in other cities.</p>
<p>The literature on techniques for increasing the rate of recycling is too extensive 
  for adequate citation here (see, for example, Ackerman (1997) and numerous sources 
  cited there). One much-discussed initiative is the use of variable rates, or 
  pay-per-bag/per-can charges for household solid waste collection. This provides 
  a clear financial incentive to the householder to produce less waste, particularly 
  when accompanied by free curbside recycling (Franke <i>et al</i>., 1999). Strict packaging 
  and lifetime product responsibility laws for manufacturers in Germany have brought 
  about innovations in the manufacture and marketing of a wide range of products. 
  Other market incentives such as repayable deposits on glass containers, lead 
  acid batteries, and other consumer products have led to major gains in recycled 
  materials in many countries. Voluntary recycling programmes have met with a 
  mixed range of success, with commercial and institutional recycling of office 
  paper and cardboard, and curbside recovery of mixed household materials generally 
  having higher recycling rates. Countries such as Austria and Switzerland successfully 
  require separation of household waste into many disaggregated categories for 
  high value recovery.</p>
<a name="3733"></a> 
<h4>3.7.3.3 Composting</h4>
<p>Increased composting of household food waste would reduce GHG emissions, but 
  may be difficult to achieve in developed countries, where an additional separation 
  of household waste would be required. In low-income developing countries, the 
  high proportion of food waste in household and municipal waste makes composting 
  attractive as a primary waste treatment technology.</p>
<p>Other new opportunities involve composting or anaerobic digestion of agricultural 
  and food industry wastes. Livestock manure management accounts for 10% of US 
  methane emissions; capture of about 70% of the methane from livestock manure 
  appears technologically feasible. Some 20% of the feasible methane capture is 
  profitable under existing conditions, with a carbon price of zero; 28% can be 
  recovered at US$20/tC<sub>eq</sub> and 61% at US$50/tC<sub>eq</sub>(US EPA, 
  1999a).</p>
<p>Biogas facilities intentionally convert organic waste to methane; use of the 
  resulting methane can substitute for fossil fuels, reducing GHG emissions. High 
  ammonia content (e.g., in swine manure) can inhibit conversion of organic waste 
  to methane. This problem can be avoided by mixing agricultural waste with other, 
  less nitrogenous wastes (Hansen <i>et al</i>., 1998). Wastes with high fat content 
  can, on the other hand, enhance and increase methane output. In Denmark, a number 
  of biogas facilities have been running successfully, accepting livestock manure 
  as well as wastes from food processing industries (Schnell, 1999). In Germany 
  and Switzerland, pilot projects compress the methane from biogas plants and 
  supply it to natural gas vehicles. Canadian engineers have completed a pilot 
  project using a mixture of waste-activated sludge, food waste, industrial sludge 
  from potato processing, and municipal waste paper. Methane production reached 
  50 l/kg of total solids, and heavy metal contamination was found to be far below 
  regulatory levels (Oleszkiewicz and Poggi-Varaldo, 1998). Woody waste with high 
  lignin content cannot be converted to methane, and yard waste is better handled 
  by composting.</p>

<h4>3.7.3.4 Incineration</h4>
<p>New combustion technologies with higher efficiencies of energy production and 
  lower emissions are currently being developed:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Fluidized bed combustion (FBC) is a very efficient and flexible system 
  that can be used for intermittent operation, and can run with solid, liquid, 
  or gaseous fuels. Despite high operating costs, this low pollution combustion 
  technology is increasingly used in Japan, and has also been used in Scandinavia 
  and the USA (NEDO, 1999; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.residua.com/wrftbfbc.html">http://www.residua.com/wrftbfbc.html</a>).
  <li> Gasification (partial incineration with restricted air supply) and pyrolysis 
  (incineration under anaerobic conditions) are two technologies that can convert 
  biomass and plastic wastes into gas, oil, and combustible solids. Gasification 
  of biomass produces a gas with a heating value of 10%-15% that of natural gas. 
  When integrated with electricity production, it can prove economically and environmentally 
  attractive; it appears best suited for clean biomass, such as wood wastes. Pilot 
  projects are now using pyrolysis for plastic wastes, and for mixed municipal 
  solid waste (MSW); they potentially have very high energy efficiency (Faaij 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998). Combined pyrolysis and gasification (Thermoselect) and combined 
  pyrolysis and combustion (Schwelbrenn-Verfahren) have also been developed and 
  implemented.
  <li> Co-incineration of fossil fuel jointly with waste leads to improved 
  energy efficiency. Stringent emission standards in some countries may limit 
  the extent to which co-incineration is possible (Faaij <i>et al</i>., 1998). In other 
  countries, emission standards for industrial combustion processes are less tight 
  than those for incinerators, leading some to fear that co-incineration might 
  produce higher emissions of air pollutants (Kossina and Zehetner, 1998).
</ul>

<h4>3.7.3.5 Wastewater Treatment</h4>
<p>Conventional sewage collection is very water intensive. Vacuum toilets, using 
  less than 1 litre per flush, have long been used on ships and have now been 
  installed in the new ICE trains in Germany. Human waste collected in this way 
  can then be anaerobically digested. This process reduces GHG emissions and water 
  usage is minimal. Acceptance of this technology has been slow because of cost 
  (Schnell, 1998).</p>
<p>Modular anaerobic or aerobic systems are available (Hairston <i>et al</i>., 1997). 
  Anaerobic digestion has the advantage of generating methane that can be used 
  as a fuel, yet many sewage treatment plants simply flare it. The potential for 
  energy generation is clearly very large. New York City&#146;s 14 sewage plants, 
  for example, generate 0.045 billion cubic metres of methane every year, most 
  of which is flared. Cities such as Los Angeles sell methane to the local gas 
  utility, and one New York plant and the Boston Harbor facility were equipped 
  with fuel cells in 1997. This new technology successfully provides needed electricity 
  and heat, but is still expensive.</p>
<p>Because of concerns about contamination of sewage sludge by heavy metals, policies 
  in many countries now encourage incineration rather than soil application. However, 
  the energy needed to dry the sludge for incineration leads to a net increase 
  in GHGs. Alternatives to sludge incineration are anaerobic digestion, gasification, 
  wet oxidation, and co-incineration with coal. These technologies are under development 
  and yield improved energy efficiencies and low GHG emissions (Faaij <i>et al</i>., 
  1998).</p>
