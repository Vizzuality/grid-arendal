<h1>2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Scenarios</h1>
<h2><a name="21"></a>2.1 Scenarios </h2>
<p>A long-term view of a multiplicity of future possibilities is required to consider 
  the ultimate risks of climate change, assess critical interactions with other 
  aspects of human and environmental systems, and guide policy responses. Scenarios 
  offer a structured means of organizing information and gleaning insight on the 
  possibilities.</p>
<p>Each mitigation scenario describes a particular future world, with particular 
  economic, social, and environmental characteristics, and they therefore implicitly 
  or explicitly contain information about DES. Since the difference between reference 
  case scenarios and stabilization and mitigation scenarios is simply the addition 
  of deliberate climate policy, it can be the case that the differences in emissions 
  among different reference case scenarios are greater than those between any 
  one such scenario and its stabilization or mitigation version. </p>
<p>This section presents an overview of three scenario literatures: general mitigation 
  scenarios produced since the SAR, narrative-based scenarios found in the general 
  futures literature, and mitigation scenarios based on the new reference scenarios 
  developed in the IPCC SRES.</p>
<h2><br>
  <a name="22"></a>2.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Mitigation Scenarios </h2>
<p>This report considers the results of 519 quantitative emissions scenarios from 
  188 sources, mainly produced after 1990. The review focuses on 126 mitigation 
  scenarios that cover global emissions and have a time horizon encompassing the 
  coming century. Technological improvement is a critical element in all the general 
  mitigation scenarios. <br>
  <br>
  Based on the type of mitigation, the scenarios fall into four categories: concentration 
  stabilization scenarios, emission stabilization scenarios, safe emission corridor 
  scenarios, and other mitigation scenarios. All the reviewed scenarios include 
  energy-related carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions; several also include 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from land-use changes and industrial processes, and 
  other important GHGs. </p>
<p>Policy options used in the reviewed mitigation scenarios take into account 
  energy systems, industrial processes, and land use, and depend on the underlying 
  model structure. Most of the scenarios introduce simple carbon taxes or constraints 
  on emissions or concentration levels. Regional targets are introduced in the 
  models with regional disaggregation. Emission permit trading is introduced in 
  more recent work. Some models employ policies of supply-side technology introduction, 
  while others emphasize efficient demand-side technology.</p>
<p>Allocation of emission reduction among regions is a contentious issue. Only 
  some studies, particularly recent ones, make explicit assumptions about such 
  allocations in their scenarios. Some studies offer global emission trading as 
  a mechanism to reduce mitigation costs. </p>
<p>Technological improvement is a critical element in all the general mitigation 
  scenarios. </p>
<p>Detailed analysis of the characteristics of 31 scenarios for stabilization 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations at 550 ppmv<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#4","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>4</a></sup></small> 
  (and their baseline scenarios) yielded several insights: </p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a wide range in baselines, reflecting a diversity of assumptions, 
    mainly with respect to economic growth and low-carbon energy supply. High 
    economic growth scenarios tend to assume high levels of progress in the efficiency 
    of end-use technologies; however, carbon intensity reductions were found to 
    be largely independent of economic growth assumptions. The range of future 
    trends shows greater divergence in scenarios that focus on developing countries 
    than in scenarios that look at developed nations. There is little consensus 
    with respect to future directions in developing regions.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The reviewed 550ppmv stabilization scenarios vary with respect to reduction 
    time paths and the distribution of emission reductions among regions. Some 
    scenarios suggested that emission trading may lower the overall mitigation 
    cost, and could lead to more mitigation in the non-OECD countries. The range 
    of assumed mitigation policies is very wide. In general, scenarios in which 
    there is an assumed adoption of high-efficiency measures in the baseline show 
    less scope for further introduction of efficiency measures in the mitigation 
    scenarios. In part this results from model input assumptions, which do not 
    assume major technological breakthroughs. Conversely, baseline scenarios with 
    high carbon intensity reductions show larger carbon intensity reductions in 
    their mitigation scenarios. </li>
</ul>
<p>Only a small set of studies has reported on scenarios for mitigating non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  gases. This literature suggests that small reductions of GHG emissions can be 
  accomplished at lower cost by including non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases; that both 
  CO<sub>2</sub> and non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would have to be controlled 
  in order to slow the increase of atmospheric temperature sufficiently to achieve 
  climate targets assumed in the studies; and that methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) mitigation 
  can be carried out more rapidly, with a more immediate impact on the atmosphere, 
  than CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation.</p>
<p>Generally, it is clear that mitigation scenarios and mitigation policies are 
  strongly related to their baseline scenarios, but no systematic analysis has 
  been published on the relationship between mitigation and baseline scenarios.<br>
