<h3>10.1.4 Progress since the Second Assessment Report on Decision Analytical 
  Frameworks </h3>
<p>Much work has been conducted since SAR. Work has focused on a wide array of 
  issues ranging from that which explores the tools of analysis to that which 
  employs those tools to shed light on the problem of climate change. Researchers 
  such as De Canio (1997), De Canio and Laitner (1997), De Canio <i>et al</i>. (2000a, 
  2000b, 2000c), Laitner and Hogan (2000), Laitner <i>et al</i>. (2000), Peters and Brassel 
  (2000), and Sanstad <i>et al</i>. (2000a, 2000b) have focused on integrated assessment, 
  endogenous technological change, and behavioural, social, and organizational 
  phenomena (discussed in <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a>). Work has also continued 
  to examine the problems of cost&#150;benefit, cost-effectiveness, and the interaction 
  of uncertainty with decision making. New approaches have also been developed, 
  including, for example, tolerable windows and safe landing.</p>

<p><a name="fig101"></a>Work has continued in the development of tools to understand 
  the influence of uncertainty on decision making. The initial work examined in 
  SAR explores the problem of emissions-mitigation objectives under a cost-effectiveness 
  framework, but the interaction between concentration limits and the date at 
  which uncertainty is resolved influences the results. This interaction occurs 
  because in decision analysis no option can ever be foreclosed before the date 
  at which uncertainty is hypothesized to be resolved. Any concentration ceiling 
  implies a cumulative emissions limit. Thus preserving the option to stay below 
  any arbitrary limit means adopting a hedging strategy. Grubb (1997) characterizes 
  the problem thus: &#147;If we delay action in the belief that we are aiming 
  at a 500ppmv target, for example, then after a couple of decades it may be simply 
  too late to be able to stabilize at 400ppmv, however urgent the problem then 
  turns out to be; and even stabilization at 450ppmv might by then involve radical 
  changes of direction that could prove economically very disruptive.&#148;</p>
<p>The core of the issue is the interplay between inertia and uncertainty; without 
  inertia any trajectory could indeed be corrected at no cost, but as inertia 
  is important, changing course may be very costly. Fortunately, the Convention 
  embodies the dynamic nature of the decision problem in drafting climate as an 
  ongoing process, not a &#147;once and for all&#148; event. The UNFCCC (1993) 
  requires periodic reviews &#147;in light of the best scientific information 
  on climate change and its impacts, as well as relevant technical, social and 
  economic information.&#148;</p>
<p>Such a sequential decision-making process aims to identify short-term strategies 
  in the face of long-term uncertainties. The next several decades will offer 
  many opportunities for learning and mid-course corrections. The relevant question 
  is not &#147;what is the best course of action for the next 100 years&#148;, 
  but rather &#147;what is the best course for the near-term given the long-term 
  objective?&#148;</p>
<p>There have been several attempts to frame the issue. <a href="#fig101">Figure 
  10.1</a> reports the results of an analysis by Ha-Duong <i>et al</i>. (1997). The authors 
  use their model of the Dynamics of Inertia and Adaptability for integrated assessment 
  of climate-change Mitigation (DIAM) to determine the least-cost emission pathway 
  given an uncertain concentration target. A defining feature of their model is 
  an inertia parameter that accounts for the time scale of change in the global 
  energy system. In their analysis they assign equal probability to a target of 
  450, 550, and 650ppmv. The solid 550ppmv line corresponds to the optimal pathway 
  when the target is known to be 550ppmv from the outset. The analysis shows the 
  optimal hedging strategy when uncertainty is not resolved until 2020. The authors 
  note that &#147;our results show that abatement over the next few years is economically 
  valuable if there is a significant probability of having to stay below ceilings 
  that would be otherwise reached within the characteristic time scales of the 
  systems producing greenhouse gases.&#148;</p>
<p>The degree of near-term hedging in the above analysis is sensitive to the date 
  of resolution of uncertainty, the inertia in the energy system, and assumes 
  that the ultimate concentration target (once it has been agreed) must be met 
  at all costs. The last stems directly from the formulation of the problem as 
  one of finding the least-cost mitigation pathway in the face of uncertainty. 
  Since a future political decision on a 450ppmv target cannot be excluded, decisions 
  prior to 2020 must be such that they do not preclude the achievement of such 
  a target.</p>
