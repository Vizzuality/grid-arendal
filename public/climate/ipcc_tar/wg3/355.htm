<h2>9.1 Introduction and Progress since the Second Assessment Report</h2>
<p>In the Second Assessment Report (SAR) and in the literature, the benefits and 
  costs of mitigation have largely been measured in terms of macro concepts such 
  as gross domestic product (GDP) or total welfare; sectoral effects have not 
  been considered as a central issue. This chapter considers these sectoral implications. 
  For a definition of co-benefits and ancillary benefits and costs, see <a href="266.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>; for the macroeconomic effects of mitigation policies, see <a href="319.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>.</p>
<p>The definitions of sectors adopted in this chapter is that of the UN System 
  of National Accounts (1993 ISIC). This is an internationally agreed set of definitions, 
  conventions, and accounts which includes the division of the macro economy into 
  industrial sectors, such as manufacturing. The data for sectoral economic models 
  are usually arranged according to these accounts, and the results of the models 
  reported below (in as much as they provide a comprehensive sectoral disaggregation 
  of the macroeconomic effects) will follow these definitions. However, the energy 
  sector is further subdivided in this chapter, since the mitigation effects are 
  so important and distinct for the component industries, namely coal, oil and 
  gas, and electricity. <br>
</p>
<p>When assessing the sectoral responses to mitigation policies and measures, 
  a distinction can be made between commercial firms (partnerships or corporations) 
  and persons (such as car drivers and home-owners) as decision makers. Firms 
  are generally expected to be more price-responsive in their fuel use, because 
  of better access to capital, information, and technologies, while persons generally 
  value lifestyles more highly in their fuel use decisions. Although &#147;sectors&#148; 
  are largely taken to be industrial contributors to GDP, households and private 
  motorists are also responsible for large amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
  and are also covered in this chapter. <br>
</p>
<p>The effects of mitigation can be divided into the effects in the sector or 
  region that undertake the mitigation policies and measures and the further, 
  consequential effects, or spillovers, on other sectors or regions. More investment 
  in energy-efficient equipment or in technology to develop a renewable source 
  of energy may lead to technological spillovers on other sectors. Such spillovers 
  are considered below.<br>
</p>
<p>This chapter continues with reviews of results from multisectoral studies (<a href="356.htm#921">9.2.1</a>), 
  followed by those on each major sector in turn (coal, petroleum and gas, non-fossil-based 
  energy, agriculture and forestry, manufacturing, construction, transport, service 
  industries, and households in Sections <a href="359.htm">9.2.2</a> to <a href="371.htm">9.2.10</a>). 
  <a href="373.htm">Section 9.3</a> reviews the literature on sectoral spillover 
  effects of mitigation in one country or region on the rest of the world. Ancillary 
  benefits associated with particular sectors or with sectoral mitigation policies 
  are covered in Sections <a href="359.htm">9.2.2</a> to <a href="371.htm">9.2.10</a>. 
  <a href="374.htm">Section 9.4</a> considers why the macro and sectoral studies 
  come to different conclusions. <a href="377.htm">Section 9.5</a> suggests areas 
  for further research.</p>
