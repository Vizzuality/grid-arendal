<h3>3.8.5 Regional Differences </h3>
<a name="3851"></a> 
<h4>3.8.5.1 Privatization and Deregulation of the Electricity Sector</h4>
<p>In many countries, state owned or state regulated electricity supply monopolies 
  have been privatized and broken up to deregulate markets such that companies 
  compete to generate electricity and to supply customers. These moves affect 
  the types of power station favoured. Traditional, large power stations (&gt; 
  600MW) have had high capital costs and construction periods of 4-7 years, which 
  have led to high interest payments during construction and the need for higher 
  planning margins. Under the new circumstances, the new power generators use 
  higher discount rates, seek lower overall costs, and try to minimize project 
  risks by preferring plants of smaller unit size. They thus favour projects with 
  low capital costs, rapid construction times, use of proven technology, high 
  plant reliability/availability, and low operating costs. CCGTs meet all of these 
  new criteria, and are favoured by generators where gas is available at acceptable 
  costs. This could point the way for the development of new designs for other 
  types of power station, which need to be smaller with modular designs that are 
  largely factory built rather than site built. Economies of scale then come from 
  replication on an assembly line rather than through size (see also <a href="233.htm">Section 
  6.2.1.3</a>).</p>
<p>Community ownership of distributed renewable energy projects, particularly 
  wind turbines and biogas plants, is becoming common in Denmark (Tranaes, 1997) 
  and more recently in the UK (UK DTI, 1999). The trend towards privately owned 
  distributed power supply systems, either independent or grid connected, is likely 
  to continue as a result of growing public interest in sustainability and technical 
  improvements in controls and asynchronous grid connections. </p>
<p>In countries where privatization of transmission line companies is occurring, 
  there is no longer any commercial rationale to construct and maintain lines 
  only to service a small demand. This has historically often been a social investment 
  by governments and aid agencies. Where grid connections are already in place, 
  it is possible that disconnections may occur in the future where the lines are 
  uneconomic. Then existing residents will have to choose between installing independent 
  domestic-scale systems or establishing community-owned co-operative schemes. 
</p>
<p>State owned utilities have been able to cross-subsidize otherwise non-competitive 
  projects including nuclear and renewable technologies. Privatization of these 
  utilities requires new methods of supporting technology implementation objectives.</p>
<p>In some cases, electricity tariffs and regulatory systems may need to be amended 
  to include the benefits and costs of embedded generation. This would enable 
  renewable energy projects to be sited on the distribution network at nodes where 
  they would bring most benefit to quality of supply (see Mitchell, 1998, 1999; 
  and <a href="224.htm">Chapter 6</a>). One detrimental impact could be an 
  increase of fossil fuel electricity generation caused by the increased need 
  to operate in load-following mode.</p>
<a name="3852"></a> 
<h4>3.8.5.2 Developing Country Issues</h4>
<p>In the past there has been little incentive to explore for gas in developing 
  countries unless there was an existing infrastructure to utilize it. The development 
  of CCGT technology now means that, if electricity generation is required, an 
  initial market for the gas can be developed quite rapidly and this market extended 
  to other sectors as the infrastructure is built.</p>
<p>Developing countries have a large need for capital to meet the development 
  of hospitals, schools, and transport and not just for energy in general or electricity 
  in particular. In such circumstances, cheaper power stations are often built 
  at lower efficiency than might otherwise be the case, for example 30%-35% efficiency 
  for an old coal-fired design rather than 40%+ for a modern 
  design. The low price of fuel in some of these countries can also make a cheaper, 
  less efficient design economically more attractive. In India, coal-fired power 
  station design has been standardized at 37.5% efficiency and capacity of 250 
  and 500MW. Capital costs are US$884/kW whereas a 40% efficiency station would 
  cost around US$977/kW. The coal price is US$25 - US$37/t, depending on location. 
  Even at the higher price, the increased capital costs for the higher efficiency 
  power station outweigh the economic benefits from its lower fuel demand and 
  hence lower emissions.</p>
<p>Technology transfer of advanced power generation technologies including CCGT, 
  nuclear, clean coal, and renewable energy would lead to emission reduction and 
  could be encouraged through the Kyoto mechanisms (see <a href="224.htm">Chapter 6</a>). In addition 
  to limited capital resources that can make advanced technologies unaffordable, 
  many developing countries face skill shortages that can impede the construction 
  and operation of such technology. This is discussed more fully in <a href="179.htm">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<p>Electricity plants and boilers are sometimes not operated as efficiently as 
  possible in developing countries. In some cases, incremental investment in such 
  a plant will yield benefits but, more often, it is investment in training the 
  operators that is lacking and that will yield substantial gains. The extension 
  of grids in regions such as India and Africa could allow better use to be made 
  of efficient power stations in order to displace less efficient local units. 
  In India, one trading scheme by three electricity companies resulted in an emissions 
  reduction of 2MtC (Zhou, 1998), and there are similar possibilities in southern 
  and east Africa (Batidzirai and Zhou, 1998). The same study shows that there 
  is a large scope in the subregion for exploiting hydropower, sharing of natural 
  gas resources for power generation, and utilization of wind power along the 
  coastal areas. These measures can displace coal-based generation which currently 
  emits 30&#150;40MtC in southern Africa alone.</p>
<p>An alternative to the extension of grids in developing countries is to increase 
  development of efficiently distributed power generation. This is discussed further 
  in the section below.</p>
<a name="3853"></a> 
<h4>3.8.5.3 Distributed Systems</h4>
<p>Distributed power comprises small power generation or storage systems located 
  close to the point of use and/or controllable load. Worldwide, these include 
  more than 100MW of existing compressed ignition and natural gas-fired spark 
  ignition engines, small combustion turbines, smaller steam turbines, and renewables. 
  Emerging distributed power technologies include cleaner natural gas or biodiesel 
  engines, microturbines, Stirling engines and fuel cells, small modular biopower 
  and geopower packaged as cogeneration units, and wind, photovoltaics and solar 
  dish engine renewable generation. Increased integration of distributed power 
  with other distributed energy resources could further enhance technology improvement 
  in this sector.</p>
<p>Interest is growing in generating power at point of use using independent or 
  grid-connected systems, often based on renewable energy. These could be developed, 
  owned, and operated by small communities. The European &#147;Campaign for Take-off&#148; 
  target for 100 communities to be supplied by 100% renewable energy and become 
  independent of the grid by 2010 will require a hybrid mix of technologies to 
  be used depending on local resources (Egger, 1999). Local employment opportunities 
  should result and the experience should aid uptake in developing countries.</p>
<p>For small grid-connected embedded generation systems, power supply companies 
  could benefit from improved power quality where the distributed sites are located 
  towards the end of long and inefficient transmission lines (Ackermann et al., 
  1999). Expensive storage would be avoided where a grid system can provide back-up 
  generation.</p>
