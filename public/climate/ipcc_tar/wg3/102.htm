<h4>3.4.4.6 Use of Biofuels</h4>
<p>Liquid and gaseous transport fuels derived from a range of biomass sources 
  are technically feasible (see <a href="131.htm">Section 3.8.4.3.2</a>). They include methanol, ethanol, 
  di-methyl esters, pyrolytic oil, Fischer-Tropsch gasoline and distillate, and 
  biodiesel from vegetable oil crops (<a href="118.htm#3643">Section 3.6.4.3</a>). Ethanol is commercially 
  produced from sugar cane in Brazil and from maize in the USA where it has been 
  sold neat or blended for more than a decade. Ethanol is blended with gasoline 
  at concentrations of 5-15%, thereby replacing oxygenates more typically used 
  in North America such as methyl-t-butylether (MTBE) and ethyl-t-butylether (ETBE) 
  additives. ETBE production from bio-ethanol is also a promising market in Europe 
  but the production costs by hydrolysis and fermentation from cereals or sweet 
  sorghum crops remain high (Grassi, 1998). </p>
<p>In Brazil the production of ethanol-fuelled cars achieved 96% market share 
  in 1985 but declined to 3.1% in 1995 and 0.1% in 1998. Since the government 
  approved a higher blend level (26%) of ethanol in gasoline the production of 
  ethanol has continued to increase achieving a peak of 15,307m<sup>3</sup> in the 1997/98 
  harvesting season. This represented 42.73% of the total fuel consumption in 
  all Otto cycle engines giving an annual net carbon emission abatement of 11% 
  of the national total from the use of fossil fuels (IPCC, 2000). </p>
<p>National fuel standards are in place in Germany for biodiesel and many engine 
  manufacturers such as Volkswagen now maintain warranties (Schindlbauer, 1995). 
  However, energy yields (litres oil per hectare) are low and full fuel cycle 
  emissions and production costs are high (see <a href="131.htm">Section 3.8.4.3.2</a>).</p>

<h4>3.4.4.7 Aircraft Technology</h4>
<p>Several major technologies offer the opportunity to improve the energy efficiency 
  of commercial aircraft by 40% or more (<a href="#tab310">Table 3.10</a>). The 
  Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board of the National Research Council (NRC, 
  1992, p. 49) concluded that it was feasible to reduce fuel consumption per seat 
  mile for new commercial aircraft by 40% by about 2020. Of the 40%, 25% was expected 
  to come from improved engine performance, and 15% from improved aerodynamics 
  and weight. A reasonable preliminary goal for reductions in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions 
  was estimated to be 20%&#150;30%.</p>

<p>An assessment of breakthrough technologies by the US National Research Council 
  (1998) estimated that the blended wing body concept alone could reduce fuel 
  consumption by 27% compared to conventional aircraft, assuming equal engine 
  efficiency. The NRC report also identified a number of breakthrough technologies 
  in the areas of advanced propulsion systems, structures and materials, sensors 
  and controls, and alternative fuels that could have major impacts on aircraft 
  energy use and GHG emissions over the next 50 years.</p>
<p>Noting that the energy efficiency of new production aircraft has improved at 
  an average rate of 1-2% per year since the dawn of the jet era, the IPCC Special 
  Report on <i>Aviation and the Global Atmosphere</i> concluded that the fuel 
  efficiency of new production aircraft could improve by 20% from 1997 to 2015 
  (<a href="#tab311">Table 3.11</a>), as a result of a combination of reductions 
  in aerodynamic drag and airframe weight, greater use of high-bypass engines 
  with improved nacelle designs, and advanced, &#147;fly-by-light&#148; fibre 
  optic control systems (Penner <i>et al</i>., 1999, Ch. 7). Advanced future aircraft 
  technologies including laminar flow concepts, lightweight materials, blended 
  wing body designs, and subsystems improvements were judged to offer 30%-40% 
  to 40%-50% efficiency improvements by 2050, with the lower range more likely 
  if reducing NO<sub>x</sub> emissions is a high priority. The purpose of these 
  scenarios was not to describe the technological or economic potential for efficiency 
  improvement and emissions reductions, but rather to provide a &#147;best judgement&#148; 
  scenario for use in assessing the impacts of aviation on the global atmosphere 
  through 2050. A number of alternatives to kerosene jet fuel were considered. 
  None were considered likely to be competitive with jet fuel without significant 
  technological breakthroughs. On a fuel cycle basis, only liquid methane and 
  hydrogen produced from nuclear or renewable energy sources were estimated to 
  reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to jet fuel derived from crude oil.</p>
<p>In operation, aircraft seat-km per kg is also influenced by aircraft size, 
  and overall passenger-km per kg efficiencies depend on load factors as well. 
  Industry analysts (Henderson, 1999) have forecasted an increase in global load 
  factors to 73% by 2018, but foresee only a small potential for increasing aircraft 
  size, however, since most additional capacity is expected to be supplied by 
  increased flight frequencies. If average aircraft size could be increased, perhaps 
  as a strategy for reducing airport congestion, further reductions in energy 
  intensity could be achieved.</p>
