<h2><a name="151"></a>1.5.1 Mitigative Capacity&#150;A Tool for Integration </h2>
<p>There are eight distinct but related determinants of mitigative capacity (Yohe, 
  2001, in press). Cast here in the context of a single country trying to confront 
  its climate change mitigation challenge, they are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>range of viable technological options for reducing emissions;</li>
  <li>range of viable policy instruments with which the country might effect the 
    adoption of these options;</li>
  <li>structure of critical institutions and the derivative allocation of decision-making 
    authority;</li>
  <li>availability and distribution of resources required to underwrite their 
    adoption and the associated, broadly defined opportunity cost of devoting 
    those resources to mitigation;</li>
  <li>stock of human capital, including education and personal security;</li>
  <li>stock of social capital, including the definition of property rights;</li>
  <li>country&#146;s access to risk-spreading processes (e.g., insurance, options 
    and futures markets, etc.); and</li>
  <li>ability of decision makers to manage information, the processes by which 
    these decision makers determine which information is credible, and the credibility 
    of the decision makers themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section will use these determinants as organizing tools in its assessment 
  of the degree to which current thinking, as evidenced by subsequent chapters, 
  includes the first very preliminary steps toward a thorough integration of cost-effectiveness, 
  equity, and sustainability on the mitigation side of the climate problem.</p>
<p>Mitigative capacity is the mitigation analogue of the concept of adaptive capacity 
  introduced in Chapter 18 of the WGII report (IPCC, 2001). Indeed, adaptive capacity 
  is offered there as a framework upon which to build systematic and comparable 
  representations of communities&#146; and/or countries&#146; ability to ameliorate 
  or exploit the impacts of the natural or social stresses that they might face. 
  As such, adaptive capacity plays a similar organizational role for WGII in their 
  assessment of impacts as mitigative capacity does herein. WGII authors built 
  their assessments around the notion that a system&#146;s vulnerability to climate 
  change is determined both by its exposure to the impacts of climate change and 
  by its adaptive capacity. Their analysis uncovered a list of determinants for 
  adaptive capacity that is nearly identical to the list of determinants for mitigative 
  capacity given above. Organization of their thoughts around those determinants 
  enabled them to integrate cost-effectiveness, equity, and sustainability into 
  their assessments of the relative vulnerabilities of different nations, regions, 
  and sectors.</p>
<p>Many of the subsequent chapters presented here offer insight into the role 
  of the first two determinants listed above in determining the ability of various 
  nations to mitigate climate change. <a href="065.htm#1511">Section 1.5.1.1</a> 
  offers a brief introduction to these insights. An equally brief assessment of 
  some of the related literature from which the roles of the other determinants 
  has been gleaned is given in Section <a href="065.htm#1512">1.5.1.2.</a> Its 
  coverage is more suggestive of where climate researchers and policymakers should 
  look for aid in formulating the next round of questions; it is less indicative 
  of where past efforts and discussion have been concentrated.</p>
<h4><a name="1511"></a>1.5.1.1 Integrating Environmental, Social, and Economic 
  Objectives in the Third Assessment Report</h4>
<p><a href="089.htm">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="155.htm">4</a> herein discuss 
  in detail the standard technological options to mitigate climate change. Some 
  or all of these options might be available to any country as it decides to reduce 
  or to slow its emissions of greenhouse cases. However, each technological option 
  must be evaluated in terms of five factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>its technological potential in an uncertain environment;</li>
  <li>its economic potential given economic uncertainty and risk;</li>
  <li>existence of technical and economic constraints to its adoption;</li>
  <li>existence of social, cultural, and political constraints to its adoption; 
    and </li>
  <li>ability of key decision makers to understand and to access its potential. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="179.htm">Chapter 5</a> underlines the significance of each of these 
  characteristics. It points out that cost and performance specifications are 
  critical; however, a technology could be expensive in one place and relatively 
  inexpensive in another; or it may be inexpensive when denominated in one numeraire, 
  but expensive when denominated in another (see Schneider, 1999). <a href="179.htm">Chapter 
  5</a> also highlights social and economic constraints derived from high private 
  discount rates, market failures, closed economies, uneven allocations of resources, 
  uneven access to decision-making processes, and other characteristics of social 
  and cultural structures. Finally, <a href="179.htm">Chapter 5</a> focuses 
  considerable attention on information. Decision makers must be able to understand 
  a technology&#146;s economic and technical potential in the context of their 
  own countries, for which data and information may be scarce or, in cases where 
  prices do not reflect social cost, misleading. Clearly, these observations extend 
  the discussion beyond simply listing gadgets towards developing an understanding 
  of how country-specific characteristics might enhance or impede decision makers&#146; 
  abilities to adopt mitigative technologies.</p>
<p>This chapter also underlines the sensitivity of acceptable policy instruments 
  to a similar list of critical parameters that extend efficiency discussions 
  to include equity and sustainability. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>opportunity cost of their implementation, measured broadly to include their 
    development, equity, and sustainability implications;</li>
  <li>sensitivity of these costs to alternative designs;</li>
  <li> availability of credible information and the ability to monitor critical 
    factors in the face of uncertainty;</li>
  <li>definition of a wide range of policy objectives and the degree to which 
    they complement the objective of climate mitigation;</li>
  <li>credibility of the policies and legitimacy of the policymakers;</li>
  <li>social, cultural, political, and economic constraints to their implementation, 
    and </li>
  <li>the structure of the decision-making process itself. </li>
</ul>
<p>These characteristics clearly have enormous significance when they are cast 
  in the context of development, equity, and sustainability. Later chapters in 
  this report show how alternative policy designs can, on average, have widely 
  different costs and implications even if they achieve comparable results. <a href="224.htm">Chapters 
  6</a>, <a href="266.htm">7</a> and <a href="319.htm">8</a> show, for example, 
  that the cost of a policy does not depend on the specification of its targeted 
  outcome only. It also depends on the specification of its timing, on the flexibility 
  that it allows, and on the degree to which it is supported by the international 
  co-ordination of similar efforts across the globe. Different policy designs 
  for the same objective can also have different distributional impacts&#150;different 
  sets of winners and losers across space and time who all come to the table with 
  different access to decision making. Moreover, the opportunity cost of any policy 
  can be measured not only in terms of economic cost, but also in terms of non-economic 
  metrics that measure progress or regression across a wide range of critical 
  variables and against an equally large range of social, cultural, or political 
  objectives (see Schneider, 1999). As a result, mitigation policies that have 
  been successfully adopted in one country might be totally beyond the range of 
  possibility in another.</p>
<p>Finally, differences in the flexibility of alternative policy designs can also 
  mean differences in long-term sustainability from one country to another. Flexibility 
  in response to one mitigation policy that adds efficiency and reduces costs 
  in one place may threaten the very existence of critical systems in another. 
  Ultimately, the goal of international agreements is to induce decision makers 
  at various levels&#150;national and municipal governments, corporate executives, 
  rural communities, and individuals engaging in both production and consumption 
  decisions&#150;to undertake actions that lead to the mitigation of GHGs. There 
  is, in short, a multitude of policy options and instruments available to decision 
  makers at various levels. </p>

</table>
<p><a href="065.htm#fig17">Figure 1.7</a> illustrates this complexity in a diagrammatic 
  form by taking the example of the Kyoto Protocol. The parties have agreed to 
  a 5.2% reduction of Annex I emissions below 1990 levels by the first commitment 
  period, 2008 to 2012. To realize these reductions, however, national governments 
  in these countries have to undertake policy measures that induce corporate and 
  other actors to modify their behaviour. As is shown presently, these policy 
  decisions cover both regulatory and market instruments. Individual economic 
  actors will respond to these incentives through internal changes as well as 
  domestic and international decisions. International decisions cover the innovative 
  Kyoto mechanisms (JI, IET, and the CDM) and are relevant to non-Annex I countries, 
  which will need to take supportive policy decisions as well. These are specifically 
  in the area of institutional development, capacity building, project approval, 
  project monitoring and certification, and national reporting. </p>
<p>Uncertainty, vulnerability to shocks, and attitudes towards risk influence 
  the perceived legitimacy of various decision options. At a global or national 
  level, public opinion and therefore public policy is affected by the scientific 
  uncertainty over the range and impact of climate change. At subnational levels, 
  such uncertainty and vulnerability lies not only in the future, but also in 
  the present circumstances of specific groups&#150;the poor, the communities 
  living in fragile or threatened areas, and the ecological refugees (Gadgil and 
  Guha, 1995). It shapes the collective experience of such groups, determines 
  their decision objectives, and affects their choices as well as susceptibility 
  to policy-induced changes. </p>
<p>Finally, the incentive situation, the nature and strength of institutions for 
  collective action, and the quality and type of information available to decision 
  makers affect individual decisions. All three of these factors vary from one 
  context to another and from one level of decision making to another. Next the 
  nature of governmental policy intervention is discussed, and then the context 
  within which such policies are used is analyzed.</p>
<h4><a name="1512"></a>1.5.1.2 Expanding the Scope of Integration</h4>
<p>Decisions that lead to the emissions of GHGs that result in global warming 
  are made under, and generally because of, the system of incentives and institutions 
  in place, and are based on the information available to decision makers. Influencing 
  such decisions requires policy intervention at global, national, or local levels. 
  Conversely, the existence of institutions and legitimacy determines the effectiveness 
  of the menu of potential governmental policies outlined above. There is significant 
  heterogeneity within most countries in the types of climate change impacts that 
  might be expected and in the likely impact of GHG mitigation policies. The ability 
  to adapt to climate change depends on the level of income and technology, as 
  well as the capacity of the system of governance and existing institutions to 
  cope with change. The ability to mitigate GHG emissions depends on industrial 
  structure (the mix of industrial activities), social structure (including, e.g., 
  the distance people must travel to work or to engage in recreational activities), 
  the nature of governance (especially the effectiveness of government policy), 
  and the availability and cost of alternatives. In short, what is feasible at 
  the national level depends significantly on what can be done at the subnational, 
  local, and various sectoral levels. However, most studies assume that the national 
  level is the most appropriate for assessing and reacting to the externalities 
  that result from emissions of GHGs and for negotiating international climate 
  change agreements. </p>
<p>The prospect of climate change is just one of many issues of concern to governments, 
  and in most countries climate policy is debated within a broader framework. 
  National policymakers, therefore, have to make trade-offs in implementing climate 
  policies within a comprehensive national and international political economy 
  framework. Many political parties and stakeholder groups oppose climate policy 
  because of perceived conflicts with private sector interests. They also perceive 
  conflicts with traditional macroeconomic goals, like full employment, price 
  stability, and international competitiveness. They also sometimes fear competition 
  with other traditional objectives for public attention and public expenditure 
  (e.g., health care, national security, infrastructure, and education). Likewise, 
  some people may resist mitigation policies (regardless of who pays for them) 
  because of the perceived adverse impacts on economic growth and poverty eradication, 
  even though others might suggest that the implementation of such policies could 
  provide potential opportunities for sustainable development. </p>
<p>Also, many countries have more than one national policy-making authority. In 
  some cases, this diversity may reflect a separation of the executive and legislative 
  branches of government. In others, it may simply be that separate agencies are 
  responsible for economic policy, environment, and international affairs. These 
  agencies will have different views regarding both the needs for climate policy 
  and its likely impact on other goals. The decision-making process invariably 
  reflects the relative political influence of these groups, and involves political 
  negotiations and compromises between them. As a result, O&#146;Riordan <i>et al</i>., 
  1998) argue that issues considered by governments to be on the policy periphery, 
  like climate change, are not easily factored into consideration of issues at 
  the policy core (such as health care, education, national economic policy, or 
  corporate manufacturing strategy). The issue networks and policy communities 
  around environmental ministries in most countries are weak relative to those 
  around economic and defence ministries. Climate change is sometimes invoked 
  to boost support for existing policy agendas, such as industrial restructuring. 
  Nonetheless, climate change has seldom, if ever, been perceived within the powerful 
  ministries and their policy communities as sufficiently threatening to their 
  departmental interests to fundamentally change those agendas (O&#146;Riordan 
  and J&auml;ger, 1996; Beuerman and J&auml;ger, 1996).</p>
<p>There is, as well, enormous variety in the range of institutional and other 
  conditions in various countries at the subnational level. The political decision-making 
  process in developed countries is affected to a certain degree by powerful non-governmental 
  institutions&#150;including corporations and issue-based non-governmental organizations 
  (NGOs; March and Rhodes, 1992; Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith, 1993; Smith, 1993; 
  Michaelowa, 1998; O&#146;Riordan <i>et al</i>., 1998). These can be a source of resources 
  and new ideas to address climate change as it occurs, but they can also impede 
  the identification and response to changes because of vested interests in the 
  current or some desired allocation of resources. In developing countries, a 
  growing number of institutions have emerged to champion environmental agendas. 
  These range from groups concerned with narrowly defined problems and opportunities 
  (e.g., grassroots groups, wetlands protection groups) to broad-based rights 
  groups (e.g. women&#146;s groups) that address a range of common problems (see, 
  e.g., Banuri <i>et al</i>., 1994). However, significant differences continue between 
  the legitimacy and reach of such groups in the developed and developing regions.</p>
<p>The role of the informal sector can also differ between developed and developing 
  countries (see, e.g., Cantor <i>et al</i>., 1992). Although the term is defined somewhat 
  loosely in the literature&#150;often referring to urban, small-scale, non-organized 
  economic activities, and elsewhere to activities not covered in national tax 
  nets&#150;estimates suggest that the informal economy may cover as much as one-third 
  of the economic activity of some developing countries. Given its relative imperviousness 
  to analysis as well as policy influence (indeed, its very existence is credited 
  by some writers to its ability to escape policy influence), it is difficult 
  to project how this sector will react to impacts from climate change or mitigation 
  policies. </p>
<p>The role of information depends critically on the legitimacy of institutions 
  that provide it. The capacity for research, analysis, and policy development 
  is generally weak in developing countries, and especially so in terms of climate 
  change. More importantly, this limited capacity is focused exclusively at the 
  national level. The result is often a credibility gap between the national and 
  local levels. In general, it is difficult to convince local actors of the significance 
  of climate change and the need for corrective action.</p>
<p>More importantly, the bulk of the research and analytical capacity at the global 
  level is concentrated in the developed countries. This is true especially of 
  climate modelling, but also in analyses of the relationship between climate 
  change and sustainable development. Since the late 1980s, massive investment 
  in climate change research has taken place in the developed countries. In contrast, 
  there is a paucity of research institutions in developing countries, with a 
  relatively small level of research effort and investment. This is adequate neither 
  for policy development nor for reassuring policymakers and NGOs of the developing 
  region that the research results are unbiased (Sagar, 1999).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#28","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>28</sup></small></a>  </p>
<p>Taken together, these insights suggest a need for investment in the research 
  and analytical capacity of the developing countries, and for orienting the research 
  effort in both developing and developed countries towards the local impacts 
  of climate change and the capacity for climate change adaptation and mitigation. 
  <a href="066.htm">Section 1.5.2</a> indicates how approaching this complexity 
  within the organizing concept of mitigative capacity can help to generate insights 
  into interpreting and extending analytical exercises, integrating these exercises 
  across multiple stresses, and using this integration to inform discussions and 
  debates in the policy arena.</p>
