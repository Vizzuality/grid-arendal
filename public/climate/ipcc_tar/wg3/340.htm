<h2>8.3 Interface between Domestic Policies and International Regimes</h2>
<p>For every country, the costs of achieving a given level of abatement will be 
  dramatically affected by the interface between its domestic policy and international 
  regimes. Since a co-ordination on the basis of simple reporting mechanisms has 
  not be adopted from the outset because it would not have been stringent enough 
  for UNFCCC objectives, some studies were devoted to clarifying the differences 
  between the two main tools for co-ordinating climate policies: country emissions 
  quotas or agreed carbon taxes.</p>
<p>Theoretically, both solutions are equivalent in a world with complete information 
  (the optimal quota leads to the same marginal abatement cost as the optimal 
  level). However, Pizer (1997), building on a seminal work by Weitzman (1974), 
  demonstrated that this is not the case if uncertainties about climate damages 
  and GHG abatement costs are considered. Indeed, welfare losses due to an error 
  of anticipation are not the same in these two approaches, depending upon whether 
  the steepness of marginal abatement cost curve is higher or lower than the steepness 
  of the damage curve. If the marginal abatement cost curve is steeper, then it 
  is preferable to agree on a pre-determined level of taxation because if this 
  level is either too low or too high, the resulting welfare losses trough climate 
  impacts will not be dramatic. This is the case in most modelling efforts as 
  long as there is no large probability of dramatic non-linearity in climate systems 
  over the middle term. This policy conclusion can be reverted if one considers 
  a high level of risk-aversion to catastrophic events (which makes the damage 
  curve steeper), or a large proportion of &#147;no regret&#148; policies (which 
  make the mitigation cost curve flatter). The main message, however, is that 
  in a tax harmonization approach, the costs of complying with commitments on 
  climate policies are known in advance (but the outcome is not predictable), 
  while in a quota approach the outcome is observable but there is an uncertainty 
  about the resultant costs. In this respect, emissions trading is logically a 
  companion tool to a system of emissions quotas, to hedge against the distributional 
  implications of surprises regarding abatement costs and emissions baselines.</p>
<p>After the Berlin Mandate (1995), a quota co-ordination approach was implicitly 
  adopted and the focus of analysis was placed on linkages between emissions trading 
  regimes and national policies. Contrary to the preceding period, very few works 
  were devoted to the case of co-ordinated carbon taxes. Hourcade <i>et al.,</i> 
  (2000a) confirmed that, because of the existing uneven distribution of income, 
  discrepancies in pre-existing taxation levels, and differences in national energy 
  and carbon intensities, a uniform carbon tax would result in very differentiated 
  losses in welfare across countries, unless appropriate compensation transfers 
  operated. However, a differentiated taxation does not minimize total abatement 
  expenditures (rich countries would have to tap more expensive abatement potentials) 
  and creates distortions in international competition. The suggested solution, 
  a uniform tax for carbon-intensive industry exposed to international competition 
  and a differentiated taxation for households, has to be at least adapted to 
  the Kyoto framework which does not preclude the use of carbon taxes but changes 
  the condition of their applicability. However, the underlying issue of how to 
  minimize abatement expenditures while guaranteeing a fair distribution of welfare 
  costs still remains.</p>
<p>Under the Kyoto framework, the interface between domestic policies and the 
  international regime passes through three main channels: the impact of international 
  emissions permit trading (under Article 17), international trading in project-related 
  credits (under Articles 6 and 12 (Read, 1999)) on abatement costs, and spillover 
  effects across economies through commercial and capital flows.<br>
