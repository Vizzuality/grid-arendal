<h3>7.1.3 Progress since the Second Assessment Report </h3>
<p>A number of IPCC activities based on SAR have developed cost methodologies 
  and applied them to the appraisal of specific policies. Some of the main activities 
  are the IPCC Technical Paper on Technologies, policies, and measures for mitigating 
  climate change (IPCC, 1996c) and the UNEP report on Mitigation and Adaptation 
  Cost Assessment Concepts, Methods and Appropriate Use, which was developed on 
  the basis of an IPCC workshop in June 1997 (Christensen <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>The IPCC Technical Paper (IPCC, 1996c) summarizes the information on mitigation 
  technology costs provided by WGII SAR (IPCC, 1996b), and the chapter on policy 
  instruments of WGIII SAR (IPCC, 1996b, Chapter 11). The aim of the Technical 
  Paper was to provide a short overview of cost information to be used by climate 
  change policymakers and by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technical 
  Advice (SBSTA) of the UN Convention on Climate Change.</p>
<p>The UNEP report (Christensen <i>et al</i>., 1998) defines and clarifies mitigation 
  and adaptation cost concepts to be used in the field of climate change based 
  on WGIII SAR (IPCC, 1996a). The aim is to overcome some of the variations in 
  the cost concepts that were presented in various chapters of SAR and to develop 
  a generic overview of cost concepts that are easier to use for practitioners 
  in the field. The report includes chapters on general mitigation and adaptation 
  cost concepts, sectoral applications, macroeconomic analysis, and special issues 
  in costing studies for developing countries, and concludes on the applicability 
  of the various cost concepts in the formulation of national climate change policies 
  and programmes.</p>
<p>During the TAR process, a crosscutting issues paper was prepared (Markandya 
  and Halsnaes, 2000). The purpose was to provide a non-technical guide to the 
  application of cost concepts in the analysis of climate change policies by any 
  of the working groups involved in the TAR. Costs of mitigation, adaptation, 
  or GHG emissions are likely to be estimated and their implications discussed 
  in many parts of the TAR. It is essential, therefore, that a common understanding 
  of the use of different cost concepts is employed. The crosscutting paper proposed 
  a set of definitions for these concepts. The paper also identified categories 
  of costs and their relevance in the climate change area. In this chapter the 
  crosscutting issues paper is taken as the point of departure, the ideas are 
  developed further and an elaboration of some of them provided. The purpose, 
  however, is the same: to ensure a common understanding of commonly used cost 
  terms, and the role of cost analysis within the broader decision-making framework 
  for climate change policies.</p>
<p>After SAR, extensive debates arose regarding suitable costing methods to quantify 
  the relative indirect economic impacts of various policies in distinct regions, 
  with no consensus on the most suitable methods to be employed. However, a consensus 
  is now beginning to emerge on how to quantify some ancillary benefits (OECD, 
  2000), and <a href="319.htm">Chapters 8</a> and <a href="353.htm">9</a> 
  herein. In preparation for TAR, Burtraw <i>et al</i>. (1999) provide a synthesis of 
  methodological issues relevant to the assessment of ancillary costs and benefits 
  of GHG mitigation policies. The magnitude of potential ancillary benefits depends 
  upon the regulatory, demographic, technological, and environmental baselines. 
  The magnitude and scope of potential benefits of GHG mitigation policies can 
  be expected to be greater in cases in which higher emission baselines obtain 
  and lower for cases in which regulatory and technological innovation have been 
  more long standing (Morgenstern, 2000).</p>
