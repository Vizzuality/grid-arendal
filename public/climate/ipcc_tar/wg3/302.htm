<h4>7.4.4.2 The Use of Average Damages </h4>
<p>A special case of the income distributional weights approach is to estimate 
  the money value of impacts for different groups of individuals or countries 
  and then apply the average damage to all individuals and countries. The best 
  example of this is the value attached to changes in the risk of death. These 
  risks are valued in terms of the statistical value of life, which caused much 
  controversy in SAR (IPCC 1996a, Chapter 6). The &#147;value of a statistical 
  life&#148; (VSL) converts individual WTP to reduce the risk of death into the 
  value of a life saved, when it is not known which life that will be. For example, 
  if each person in a community has a WTP of US$10 to reduce the risk of death 
  by one in a hundred thousand, then the collective WTP of a group of 100,000 
  is US$1 million for a measure that would, on average, save one life. Hence, 
  the figure of US$1 million is referred to as the VSL. This measure is one way 
  of valuing changes in risks of mortality. Other ways include a &#147;human capital&#148; 
  approach, which values the loss of income and multiplies it by the change in 
  risk, or a &#147;life years lost&#148; approach, which takes the WTP for life 
  years that could be lost as a result of changes in the survival probabilities 
  an individual faces. Of these, the VSL has been used most commonly in recent 
  years. The human capital approach is not well founded in terms of welfare and 
  the life years lost approach is still being developed.</p>
<p>The VSL is generally lower in poor countries than in rich countries, but it 
  is considered unacceptable by many analysts to impose different values for a 
  policy that has to be international in scope and decided by the international 
  community. In these circumstances, analysts use average VSL and apply it to 
  all countries. Of course, such a value is not what individuals would pay for 
  the reduction in risk, but it is an &#147;equity adjusted&#148; value, in which 
  greater weight is given to the WTP of lower income groups. On the basis of EU 
  and US VSLs and a weighting system that has some broad appeal in terms of government 
  policies towards income distribution, Eyre <i>et al</i>. (1998) estimate the average 
  world VSL at around 1 million Euros (approximately US$1 million at 1999 exchange 
  rates).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#20","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>20</sup></small></a></p>
<p>Formally, it can be shown that the use of average values for damages implies 
  income weights based on an elasticity of one, which, as can be seen from above, 
  is broadly consistent with government policies towards income redistribution 
  (Fankhauser <i>et al</i>., 1997; Eyre <i>et al</i>., 1998). The advantage of this approach 
  is that it addresses equity concerns while retaining a valuation of damages 
  that is broadly consistent with the efficiency approach. Such an approach may 
  be a way to reflect the equal value of lives as seen from a global policy perspective. 
  National perspectives and opportunities should be addressed in another way.
