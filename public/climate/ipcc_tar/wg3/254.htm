<h4>6.3.5.2 Compliance</h4>
<p>The bulk of environmental agreements cannot operate the financial &#147;carrots&#148; 
  and/or trade restriction &#147;sticks&#148; illustrated by the ozone regime 
  (Wiser, 1999a). The key question therefore becomes: how can compliance by all 
  Parties be secured, given the consensual basis of international law and the 
  reluctance of Parties to endow international bodies with legal authority to 
  enforce the international commitments Parties have (freely) undertaken against 
  them? The UNFCCC has near universal participation based on the traditional consensual 
  approach buttressed by provisions that aim to facilitate developing country 
  participation through the provision of financial and technological resources. 
  The general nature of the commitments contained in the Convention would, in 
  any case, prove difficult to enforce. These factors explain why Parties have 
  not endowed the supreme body of the Convention, the CoP, with the authority 
  to impose legally binding consequences on a Party in the event of non-compliance. 
  Thus at present, no legal body exists to enforce compliance in the climate change 
  context. </p>
<p>The quantified, legally binding commitments of the Kyoto Protocol pose a different 
  challenge (Werksman, 1998). In the period after Kyoto, the majority of Parties 
  signalled a clear desire to move towards a compliance system based on legally 
  binding consequences, even though the compliance provisions of the Kyoto Protocol 
  provide that legally binding consequences can only be adopted by means of a 
  formal amendment to the Protocol. Be that as it may, UNFCCC negotiations on 
  the institutions and procedures of a compliance system for the Protocol are 
  well advanced.</p>
<p>Various suggestions have been put forward in the literature and by Parties 
  for the kind of legally binding consequences deemed appropriate in the climate 
  regime (Corfee Morlot, 1998; Wiser and Goldberg, 2000). These include the following 
  (Grubb <i>et al</i>., 1998; UNFCCC, 2000):</p>
<ul>
  <li>allowing a &#147;true-up&#148; or grace period with opportunity to buy quotas;<br>
  </li>
  <li>payment into a national or international compliance fund that would invest 
    in quotas;<br>
  </li>
  <li>issuing cautions and/or reports to motivate public pressure;<br>
  </li>
  <li>suspending treaty privileges (such as voting or the right to nominate members 
    for office);<br>
  </li>
  <li>exclusion from access to the Kyoto mechanisms; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>financial penalties and implementing trade sanctions. </li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of the difficulties in agreeing any of these consequences, and 
  their future enforceability, more attention has been paid to policy tools that 
  prevent non-compliance. Again, suggestions in the literature and from the Parties 
  focused on ensuring that emissions trading must be transparent at both the Party 
  and entity level<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#78","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>78</sup></small></a>, and that emissions data, such as inventories, are publicly 
  available. The idea being that Parties and/or firms may fear the reputation 
  consequences of being identified as polluters. Furthermore, trading could be 
  authorized only for eligible Parties or entities, namely those meeting some 
  minimum standards on monitoring and reporting. Non-eligible Parties and/or entities 
  could be suspended from the trading system. </p>
<p>Parties also could require that insurance be obtained for traded tonnes of 
  emissions reductions. An extra quota reserve held for the premium payer could 
  then be claimed if the traded tonnes fail to be verified as emission reductions. 
  A similar proposal is to establish a &#147;true-up&#148; period or grace period 
  (of some several months or years) after 2012; a party that is able to come into 
  compliance at the end of this true-up period would be deemed to have complied 
  with the agreement. Several other possibilities have been mentioned to enforce 
  compliance with the Kyoto targets in a situation with IET.</p>
