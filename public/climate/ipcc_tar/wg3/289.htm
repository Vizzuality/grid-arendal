<h4>7.3.3.1 Double Dividend </h4>
<p>The potential for a double dividend arising from climate mitigation policies 
  has been extensively studied during the 1990s. In addition to the primary aim 
  of improving the environment (the first dividend), such policies, if conducted 
  through revenue-raising instruments such as carbon taxes or auctioned emission 
  permits, yield a second dividend, which can be set against the gross costs of 
  these policies.</p>
<p>The literature demonstrates theoretically that the costs of addressing greenhouse 
  targets with policy instruments of all kinds&#150;command-and-control as well 
  as market-based approaches&#150;can be greater than otherwise anticipated, because 
  of the interaction of these policy instruments with existing domestic tax systems.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#8","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>8</sup></small></a> 
  Domestic taxes on labour and investment income change the economic returns to 
  labour and capital and distort the efficient use of these resources.</p>
<p>The cost-increasing interaction reflects the impact that GHG policies can have 
  on the functioning of labour and capital markets through their effects on real 
  wages and the real return to capital.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#9","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>9</sup></small></a> 
  By restricting the allowable GHG emissions, permits, regulations, or a carbon 
  tax raise the costs of production and the prices of output, and thus reduce 
  the real return to labour and capital. If government revenues are to remain 
  unchanged, labour or capital tax rates have to be raised, exacerbating prior 
  distortions in the labour and capital markets. Thus, to attain a given GHG emissions 
  target, all instruments have a cost-increasing &#147;interaction effect&#148;.</p>
<p>For policies that raise revenue for the government (carbon taxes and auctioned 
  permits), this is only part of the story, however. These revenues can be recycled 
  to reduce existing distortionary taxes. Thus, to attain a given GHG emissions 
  target, revenue-generating policy instruments have the advantage of a potential 
  cost-reducing &#147;revenue-recycling effect&#148;, as compared to the alternative, 
  non-auctioned tradable permits or other instruments that do not generate revenue 
  (Bohm, 1998). In a simple, stylized representation of the economy, Bovenberg 
  <i>et al</i>. (1994) and Goulder (1995a, b) suggest that in only a few cases is the 
  tax interaction effect fully offset by the revenue-recycling effect. In theoretical, 
  numerical analyses, the &#147;interaction effect&#148; is found to be larger 
  than the &#147;revenue-recycling effect&#148; (Parry <i>et al</i>., 1999), which means 
  that the introduction of an environmental policy, regardless of the policy instrument(s) 
  used, has a net cost to the economy.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>10</sup></small></a> 
  It is also true, however, that under some circumstances the (cost-reducing) 
  &#147;revenue-recycling effect&#148; might exceed the (cost-increasing) &#147;interaction 
  effect&#148;. This could happen if, for example, the interaction effect was 
  small, for example because of a sufficiently inelastic labour supply, or if 
  some highly distortionary pre-existing taxes could be lowered.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#11","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>11</sup></small></a> 
</p>
<p>However, it is unclear whether the empirical findings of the interaction effect 
  are due more to the assumptions invoked for tractable general equilibrium analysis 
  than to real-world considerations (Kahn and Farmer, 1999). </p>
<p>In summary, all domestic GHG policies have an indirect economic cost from the 
  interactions of the policy instruments with the fiscal system, but in the case 
  of revenue-raising policies this cost is partly offset (or more than offset) 
  if, for example, the revenue is used to reduce existing distortionary taxes. 
  Whether these revenue-raising policies can reduce distortions in practice depends 
  on whether revenues can be &#147;recycled&#148; to tax reduction. See <a href="224.htm">Chapter 
  6</a> for the policy relevance of these estimated effects and <a href="319.htm">Chapter 
  8</a> for model-based empirical studies. </p>
