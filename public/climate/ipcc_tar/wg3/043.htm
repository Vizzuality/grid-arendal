<h2><a name="93"></a>9.3 Sectoral Ancillary Benefits of Greenhouse Gas Mitigation</h2>
<p>The direct costs for fossil fuel consumption are accompanied by environmental 
  and public health benefits associated with a reduction in the extraction and 
  burning of the fuels. These benefits come from a reduction in the damages caused 
  by these activities, especially a reduction in the emissions of pollutants that 
  are associated with combustion, such as SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, CO and 
  other chemicals, and particulate matter. This will improve local and regional 
  air and water quality, and thereby lessen damage to human, animal, and plant 
  health, and to ecosystems. If all the pollutants associated with GHG emissions 
  are removed by new technologies or end-of-pipe abatement (for example, flue 
  gas desulphurization on a power station combined with removal of all other non-GHG 
  pollutants), then this ancillary benefit will no longer exist. But such abatement 
  is limited at present and it is expensive, especially for small-scale emissions 
  from dwellings and cars (See also <a href="038.htm#86">Section 8.6</a>).</p>
<h2>
  <a name="94"></a>9.4 The Effects of Mitigation on Sectoral Competitiveness</h2>
<p>Mitigation policies are less effective if they lead to loss of international 
  competitiveness or the migration of GHG-emitting industries from the region 
  implementing the policy (so-called carbon leakage). The estimated effects, reported 
  in the literature, on international price competitiveness are small while those 
  on carbon leakage appear to beat the stage of competing explanations, with large 
  differences depending on the models and the assumptions used. There are several 
  reasons for expecting that such effects will not be substantial. First, mitigation 
  policies actually adopted use a range of instruments and usually include special 
  treatment to minimize adverse industrial effects, such as exemptions for energy-intensive 
  industries. Second, the models assume that any migrating industries will use 
  the average technology of the area to which they will move; however, instead 
  they may adopt newer, lower CO<sub>2</sub>-emitting technologies. Third, the 
  mitigation policies also encourage low-emission technologies and these also 
  may migrate, reducing emissions in industries in other countries (see also <a href="039.htm">Section 
  8.7</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<h2>
  <a name="95"></a>9.5 Why the Results of Studies Differ</h2>
<p>The results in the studies assessed come from different approaches and models. 
  A proper interpretation of the results requires an understanding of the methods 
  adopted and the underlying assumptions of the models and studies. Large differences 
  in results can arise from the use of different reference scenarios or baselines. 
  And the characteristics of the baseline can markedly affect the quantitative 
  results of modelling mitigation policy. For example, if air quality is assumed 
  to be satisfactory in the baseline, then the potential for air-quality ancillary 
  benefits in any GHG mitigation scenario is ruled out by assumption. Even with 
  similar or the same baseline assumptions, the studies yield different results. 
</p>
<p>As regards the costs of mitigation, these differences appear to be largely 
  caused by different approaches and assumptions, with the most important being 
  the type of model adopted. Bottom-up engineering models assuming new technological 
  opportunities tend to show benefits from mitigation. Top-down general equilibrium 
  models appear to show lower costs than top-down time-series econometric models. 
  The main assumptions leading to lower costs in the models are that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>new flexible instruments, such as emission trading and joint implementation, 
    are adopted;</li>
  <li>revenues from taxes or permit sales are returned to the economy by reducing 
    burdensome taxes; and </li>
  <li>ancillary benefits, especially from reduced air pollution, are included 
    in the results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, long-term technological progress and diffusion are largely given in 
  the top-down models; different assumptions or a more integrated, dynamic treatment 
  could have major effects on the results.</p>
