<h3>2.5.2 Review of Post-SRES Mitigation Scenarios</h3>
<a name="2521"></a> 
<h4>2.5.2.1 Background and Outline of Post-SRES Analysis</h4>
<p>The review of general mitigation scenarios shows that mitigation scenarios 
  and policies are strongly related to their baselines, and that there has been 
  no systematic comparison of the relationship between baseline and mitigation 
  scenarios. Modellers participating in the SRES process recognized the need to 
  analyze and compare mitigation scenarios using as their baselines the new IPCC 
  scenarios, which quantify a wide range of future worlds. Consequently, they 
  participated (on a voluntary basis) in a special comparison programme to quantify 
  SRES-based mitigation scenarios (Morita <i>et al.</i>, 2000a; 2000b). These SRES-based 
  scenarios are called &#147;Post-SRES Mitigation Scenarios&#148;.</p>
<p>The process of the post-SRES analysis was started by a public invitation to 
  modellers. A &#147;Call for Scenarios&#148; was sent to more than one hundred 
  researchers in March 1999 by the Co-ordinating Lead Authors of this chapter 
  and the SRES to facilitate an assessment of the potential implications of mitigation 
  scenarios based on the SRES cases, which report was developed in support of 
  the Third Assessment Report. Modellers from around the world were invited to 
  prepare quantified stabilization scenarios for two or more concentrations of 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, based on one or more of the six SRES scenarios. 
  Concentration ceilings include 450, 550 (minimum requirement), 650, and 750ppmv, 
  and harmonization with the SRES scenarios was required by tuning reference cases 
  to SRES values for GDP, population, and final energy demand.</p>
<p>Nine modelling teams participated in the comparison programme, including six 
  SRES modelling teams and three other teams: AIM team (Jiang <i>et al.</i>, 2000), ASF 
  team (Sankovski <i>et al.</i>, 2000), IMAGE team, LDNE team (Yamaji <i>et al.</i>, 2000), 
  MESSAGE-MACRO team (Riahi &amp; Roehrl, 2000), MARIA team (Mori, 2000), MiniCAM 
  team (Pitcher, 2000), PETRO team (Kverndokk <i>et al.</i>, 2000) and WorldScan team 
  (Bollen <i>et al.</i>, 2000). <a href="#tab26">Table 2.6</a> shows all the modelling 
  teams and the stabilized concentration levels which were adopted as stabilization 
  targets by each one. Most of the modelling teams covered more than two SRES 
  baseline scenarios, and half of them developed multiple stabilization cases 
  for at least one baseline, so that a systematic review can be conducted to clarify 
  the relationship between baseline scenarios and mitigation policies and/or technologies. 
</p>
<p>While all baselines were analyzed, the A1B baseline was most frequently used. 
  Across baselines, the stabilization target of 550ppmv seemed to be the most 
  popular. Because of time constraints involved in quantifying the stabilization 
  scenarios, the modelling teams mostly focused their analyses on energy-related 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. However, about half of the modelling teams, notably 
  the AIM, IMAGE, MARIA, and MiniCAM teams, have quantified mitigation scenarios 
  in non-energy CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as well as in non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 
  The modelling teams that did not estimate non-energy CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  introduced scenarios of them from outside of their models for estimating atmospheric 
  concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>. </p>
<p>In order to check the performance of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration stabilization 
  for each post-SRES mitigation scenario, a special &#147;generator&#148; (Matsuoka, 
  2000) was used by the modelling teams to convert the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  into CO<sub>2</sub> concentration trajectories. In addition, the generator was 
  used by them to estimate the eventual level of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  by 2300, based on the 1990 to 2100 CO<sub>2</sub> emissions trajectories from 
  the scenarios. This generator is based on the Bern Carbon Cycle Model (Joos 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1996), which was used in the IPCC SAR (IPCC, 1996) and TAR (IPCC, 2001). 
  Using this generator, each modelling team adjusted their mitigation scenarios 
  so that the interpolated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration reached one of the alternative 
  fixed target levels at the year 2150 within a 5% error. The year 2150 was selected 
  based on Enting <i>et al.</i> (1994) who gave a basis for stabilization scenarios of 
  the IPCC SAR (IPCC, 1996).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#13","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>13</sup></small></a> 
  A further constraint imposed was that the interpolated emission curve should 
  be smooth after 2100, the end of the time-horizon of the scenarios. This adjustment 
  played an important role in the post-SRES analyses for harmonizing emissions 
  concentrations levels across the stabilization scenarios. The key driving forces 
  of emissions such as population, GDP, and final energy consumption were harmonized 
  in baseline assumptions specified by the six SRES scenarios.</p>

<h4>2.5.2.2 Storylines of Post-SRES Mitigation Scenarios</h4>
<p>The procedure for creating post-SRES mitigation scenarios was similar to the 
  SRES process, even though the period for the post-SRES work was much shorter 
  than that for the SRES and, in contrast to the SRES process, the exercise was 
  voluntary and not mandated by the IPCC. The storyline approach of SRES indicates 
  that different future worlds will have different mitigative capacities (cf. 
  <a href="065.htm#151">Section 1.5.1</a>). Hence, the first step of the post-SRES 
  scenario work was to create storylines for the mitigation scenarios.</p>
<p>In general, mitigation scenarios are defined relative to a baseline scenario. 
  If mitigation strategies are formulated and implemented in any of the future 
  worlds as described within SRES, a variety of aspects of that world will determine 
  the capacity to formulate and implement carbon reduction policies, for instance:<br>
<ul>
  <li> The availability and dissemination of relevant knowledge on emissions and 
    climate change;<br>
  <li> The institutional, legal, and financial infrastructure to implement mitigation 
    policies and measures;<br>
  <li> Entrepreneurial and/or governmental policies for generating innovation 
    and encouraging the penetration of new technologies; and<br>
  <li> The mechanisms by which consumers and entrepreneurs respond to changing 
    prices and new products and processes. 
</ul>
<p>In the post-SRES process, it was difficult for the modelling teams to consider 
  all of these aspects with relation to the SRES future worlds, because of their 
  inherent complexity and the amount of time available for the work. However, 
  some aspects were considered by some modelling teams and these were reflected 
  in the quantification assumptions. The rest of this section illustrates these 
  major points in the form of storylines for each of the six SRES scenarios, which 
  describe the relationship between the kind of future world on the one hand and 
  the capacity for mitigation on the other.</p>
<p>The A1 world is well equipped to formulate and implement mitigation strategies 
  in view of its high-tech, high-growth orientation and its willingness to co-operate 
  at a global scale, provided the major actors acknowledge the need for mitigation. 
  There will be good monitoring and reporting on emissions and climate change, 
  and possible signs of climate change will be detected early and become part 
  of the international agenda. Market-oriented policies and measures will be the 
  preferred response. Least-cost options will be searched for and implemented 
  through international negotiation and mechanisms with the support of governments 
  and multinational companies. New emission reduction technologies from developed 
  countries will enable developing countries to respond more rapidly and effectively 
  if barriers to technology transfer can be overcome. In this high-growth world, 
  the economic costs associated with the response to climate change are likely 
  to be bearable. In the A1B scenario, where mitigation strategies may hit the 
  limits of renewable energy supply, and in the A1FI scenario, carbon removal 
  and storage as well as higher end-use energy efficiency will become major emission 
  reduction options. In the A1T scenario, technology developments are such that 
  mitigation policies and measures only require limited additional efforts. </p>
<p>Developing and implementing climate change mitigation measures and policies 
  in the A2 world can be quite complicated. This is a result of several features 
  embedded in the scenario storyline: rapid population growth, relatively slow 
  GDP per capita growth, slow technological progress, and a regional and partially 
  &#147;isolationist&#148; approach in national and international politics. Because 
  of all these serious challenges, the abatement of GHG emissions in the A2 world 
  becomes plausible only in the situation when the negative effects of climate 
  change become imminent and the associated losses &#147;outweigh&#148; the costs 
  of mitigation. The same features that make the A2 world &#147;non-receptive&#148; 
  to worldwide mitigation policies may exacerbate the climate change effects and 
  prompt nations to act. Measures such as a rapid shift towards high-tech renewable 
  energy or deep-sea carbon storage will be highly improbable in the A2 world 
  as a consequence of technology limitations. Instead, such relatively low-tech 
  measures as limiting energy consumption, and capturing and using methane from 
  natural gas systems, coal mining, and landfills better fit the A2 world&#146;s 
  economic and technological profile. The lack of global co-operation may cause 
  rather large regional variations in the feasibility and cost of mitigation policies 
  and measures.</p>
<p>The B1 world is also well equipped to formulate and implement mitigation strategies, 
  in view of its high economic growth and willingness to co-operate at a global 
  scale. In comparison with the A1 world, however, it will be confronted with 
  higher marginal abatement costs, although total costs are much lower than in 
  A1B or A1FI. This is because baseline carbon emissions are lower in the B1 world 
  compared to the A1 world, a consequence of the emphasis on sustainable development 
  in B1. There will be intense monitoring and reporting of emissions and climate 
  change. The precautionary principle informs international agenda setting and 
  policy formulation, with governments taking responsibility for climate change-related 
  preventive and adaptive action. Tightening international standards generates 
  incentives for further innovation towards energy-efficiency and low- and zero-carbon 
  options. Educational campaigns are another important instrument. Developed regions 
  support the less developed regions in a variety of ways, including transfer 
  of energy-efficiency and renewable-energy related technologies. Carbon taxes 
  are introduced; an elaborate phase-in mechanism for less developed regions is 
  negotiated and implemented. A part of the carbon tax revenue is used to compensate 
  some fossil-fuel exporters and for a fund to compensate those affected by climate 
  change. <br>
  <br>
  In the B2 scenario actions to reduce GHG emissions are taken mainly at a local 
  or regional scale in response to climate change impacts. Environmentally aware 
  citizens of the B2 world will increasingly attribute damages to human-induced 
  climate change. High-income countries, which are generally less vulnerable to 
  climate change impacts, will increasingly see the need for climate policy action 
  as a consequence of cost-benefit analyses. With increasing costs of damage, 
  counter-measures challenge existing energy sector policies and institutional 
  frameworks. Generally high educational levels promote both development and environmental 
  protection. Resource availability, economic development, and technical change 
  are uneven over regions. In relative terms, R&amp;D expenditures are expected 
  to stay constant, but they will be more targeted towards cleaner and less carbon-intensive 
  energy technologies. Existing bilateral trade links will foster bilateral technology 
  transfer from OECD countries to some developing countries. This is because rapidly 
  increasing energy and, in particular, electricity demand in developing countries 
  present business opportunities no longer available in OECD countries. Therefore, 
  there exist a number of incentives for bilateral environmental policy co-operation 
  between R&amp;D intensive countries in the North and developing countries of 
  the South. Energy trade links, first for oil and later for natural gas and methanol, 
  will play an important seed role for new environmental bilateral co-operation, 
  leading to a regionally heterogeneous approach to GHG reduction.</p>
