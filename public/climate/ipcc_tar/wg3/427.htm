<h3>10.3.4 Decision-making Frameworks for Sustainable Development and Climate 
  Change </h3>
<p>Decision making related to climate change is a crucial part of making decisions 
  about sustainable development simply because climate change is one the most 
  important symptoms of &#147;unsustainability&#148;. Indeed, global warming poses 
  a significant potential threat to future development activities and the economic 
  well being of a large number of human beings. Climate change could also undermine 
  social welfare and equity in an unprecedented manner. In particular, both intra- 
  and intergenerational equities are likely to be worsened. Lastly, increasing 
  anthropogenic emissions and accumulations of GHGs might significantly perturb 
  a critical global subsystem&#151;the atmosphere. Policymakers routinely make 
  macro-level decisions that influence both climate change mitigation and adaptation, 
  but are of a broader scope than strategies specifically related to climate change. 
  These decisions relate to economic development, environmental sustainability, 
  and social equity issues&#151;which invariably have a much higher priority in 
  national agendas than does climate change (Munasinghe, 2000). In this context, 
  economic&#150;environmental&#150;social interactions could be identified and 
  analyzed and effective sustainable development policies formulated by linking 
  and articulating them explicitly with climate change policies.</p>
<h4><a name="10341"></a>10.3.4.1 Forms of Decision-making</h4>
<p>Despite the close links, climate change and sustainable development have been 
  pursued as largely separate discourses. &#147;The sustainable development research 
  community has not generally considered how the impacts of a changing climate 
  may affect efforts to develop more sustainable societies. Global warming is 
  acknowledged as a problem, but is typically leaped over in an effort to push 
  governments towards specific policy responses. Conversely, the concept of sustainable 
  development and the methodological and substantive arguments associated with 
  it are notably absent in the climate change literature&#148; (Cohen <i>et al</i>., 
  1998). Despite the strong synergies between policies oriented to climate change 
  and national development objectives, different ways of thinking in approaching 
  the two problems lead to different social practices and decision-making procedures, 
  which makes it difficult to establish strong working linkages between them.</p>
<p>The main point here is that climate change and sustainable development are 
  rooted in very different disciplines, which results in distinct conceptual frameworks 
  and policy assessments. The dominant natural science approach to climate change 
  has constructed it as an environmental problem, which can be identified and 
  managed objectively by means of scientific rationality. This formulation has 
  resulted in a number of &#147;value neutral&#148; decision-making approaches 
  and methods that represent only the technical dimension of a much more complex 
  set of decision-making problems (Jaeger <i>et al</i>., 1998). These are not especially 
  helpful in deciding how to respond politically, because they ignore the human 
  dimensions of the problem and the difficult and locally differentiated politics 
  of responding to it. In contrast, the human-centred sustainable development 
  approach to environmental problems is more politically and geographically sensitive, 
  but it is analytically vague. This makes it difficult to define or implement 
  in practice (Cohen <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>This distinction does not simply apply to the formalities, but has rather practical 
  consequences on the systems of rules, decision-making procedures, social practices, 
  and role of stakeholders&#151;the institutional arrangements that determine 
  the processes of problem solving and decision making. Different disciplinary 
  perspectives of climate change and sustainable development can be associated 
  with two major streams of institutional arrangements models, characterized as 
  collective-action and social-practice models (Clark, 1998). A collective-action 
  model, which reflects the mainstream thinking of climate policy literature, 
  embodies the rational actor paradigm. Social actors are coherent identities 
  that possess well-defined preference structures and seek to maximize payoffs 
  through a process of weighting the benefits and costs associated with alternative 
  choices in situations that involve strategic interaction. According to this 
  view, &#147;climate change can be decomposed into a conceptually simple (if 
  still practically challenging) problem, for which a rational solution can be 
  constructed and implemented within the existing framework of political power 
  and technical expertise&#148; (Jaeger <i>et al</i>., 1998). The role of government 
  institutions, as the relevant actors in the decision-making process, is to co-ordinate 
  regulation through policy instruments to prevent individualistic behaviour from 
  producing outcomes that are worse for all participants than the feasible alternatives 
  under optimal, rational choices (Clark, 1998; Young, 1998).</p>
<p>By contrast, sustainable development is closer to the idea of institutions 
  as arrangements that engender patterned practices, which play a role in shaping 
  the identity of participants and feature the articulation of normative discourses, 
  the emergence of informal communities, and the encouragement of social learning. 
  This category of social-practice institutional arrangements (Young, 1998) directs 
  attention to processes through which actors become enmeshed in complex social 
  practices. These subsequently influence their behaviour through the de facto 
  engagement in belief systems and normative preferences, rather than through 
  conscious decisions about compliance with regulatory rules. From this point 
  of view, control, legitimacy, credibility, and appropriate decision-making processes 
  become crucial issues in the construction of sustainable development practices.</p>
<p>With such dissimilar discourses it is not surprising that climate change and 
  sustainable development have been pursued as two separate agendas for the purposes 
  of policy formulation and action. Moreover, while these issues have achieved 
  a high level of public interest and visibility, climate change is the issue 
  that so far has formally been accepted for serious consideration in government 
  agendas. Sustainable development has not yet been able to translate its ideals 
  into concrete objectives for problem solving and decision making. In this context, 
  scientists are confronted with the urgent task of &#147;reforming the relationship 
  between science research and policymaking&#148; (Rayner and Malone, 1998b). 
  This task implies a twofold effort. First, the sustainable development discourse 
  needs greater analytical and intellectual rigor (methods, indicators, etc.) 
  to make the concept advance from theory to practice. Second, the climate change 
  discourse needs to be aware of both the restrictive set of assumptions that 
  underlie the tools and methods applied in the analysis, and the social and political 
  implications of the scientific constructions of climate change (Cohen <i>et al</i>., 
  1998).</p>
