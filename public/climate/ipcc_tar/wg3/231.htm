<h2>6.2 National Policies, Measures, and Instruments </h2>
<p>Before policies and measures that aim to reduce, or remove barriers that hamper, 
  GHG emissions or enhance sequestration by sinks are analyzed, it is necessary 
  to understand the substantial impact that other policies (such as the structural 
  reforms of trade liberalization and liberalization of energy markets) have had 
  on GHG emissions in several developing countries, economies in transition (EITs), 
  and some developed countries. These policies, sometimes coupled with macroeconomic, 
  market-oriented reforms, set the framework in which more specific climate policies 
  would be implemented. Therefore, to assess correctly the feasibility of any 
  particular policy, it is important to understand this new policy context. The 
  effect of these reforms on energy use and GHG emissions is not clear <i>a priori</i>. 
  Impacts can differ widely among countries, depending on implementation strategies 
  and the existence of other regulatory policies designed to prevent the undesired 
  effects of free market operation in the presence of externalities, information, 
  and co-ordination problems.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="621"></a>6.2.1 Non-Climate Policies with Impacts on Greenhouse Gas 
  Emissions</h3>
<h4><a name="6211"></a>6.2.1.1 Structural Reform Policies</h4>
<p>During the 1990s, several countries, especially EITs and developing countries, 
  implemented drastic market-oriented reforms that have had important effects 
  on energy use and energy efficiency, and therefore on GHG emissions.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#12","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>12</sup></small></a> 
  Most countries have undergone what has been called the first generation of structural 
  reforms: trade liberalization, financial deregulation, tax reform, privatization 
  of state-owned enterprises, and opening the capital account as part of a strategy 
  to attract foreign investment. Some countries have also implemented macroeconomic 
  stabilization packages that include fiscal discipline, independence of monetary 
  policy from the public sector, and exchange rate unification.</p>
<p>The two largest countries in terms of population and coal reserves, China and 
  India, have also started to reform their economic systems towards a more free-market 
  orientation, although at a slower pace than many other countries. Since 1978, 
  energy use in China has increased, on average, 4%/yr. However, the energy&#150;output 
  ratio in China fell 55% between 1978 and 1995.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#13","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>13</sup></small></a> 
  Garbaccio <i>et al</i>. (1999), using input&#150;output tables, found that most 
  of this reduction arose from technical change, a result supported by other studies 
  (Polenske and Lin, 1993; Sinton and Levine, 1994). An increase in energy-intensive 
  imports has also led to decreased energy use per unit of GDP. Others have attributed 
  the reduction to sectoral shifts in the composition of output (Smil, 1990; Kambara, 
  1992). As reform-induced changes aimed at increasing GDP may increase the use 
  of energy, the net effect on GHG emissions of structural reform in China is 
  an empirical problem that depends on the choice of development strategies, technologies, 
  and complementary policies.</p>
<p>Future economic growth in all countries may be accompanied by increases in 
  GHG emissions. Even if economic growth increases energy efficiency (both in 
  terms of production and consumption), the scale effect may dominate and GHG 
  emissions may rise, depending on the extent to which other policies and measures 
  are implemented to curb emissions (Fisher-Vanden, 1999).<br>
