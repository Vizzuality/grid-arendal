<h3>10.1.3 Tools of Analysis and their Summary in the Second Assessment Report 
</h3>
<h4><a name="10131"></a>10.1.3.1 Tools of Analysis</h4>
<p>A wide variety of tools have been applied to the climate problem. These are 
  enumerated and briefly described in <a href="#tab101">Table 10.1</a>. In general, 
  these tools help decision makers in several ways&#150;choose a policy strategy, 
  understand the implications of alternative policy strategies, understand the 
  joint interactions of multiple, individual policy strategies. The tool can be 
  employed by either a single decision maker or by stakeholder groups. Their quantitative 
  nature and their ability to incorporate the global, long-term diversity of relevant 
  human activities, the uncertainty, and the irreversibility characteristics of 
  the problem mean that decision frameworks have been broadly applied to the climate 
  problem. This approach has several special cases, which have themselves received 
  broad attention, including cost&#150;benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness 
  analysis. We review progress in these areas later in this section, after the 
  SAR and the &#147;tolerable window and/or safe landing&#148; (TWSL) work.</p>
<p>Other tools have also been employed or have the potential to be employed to 
  help illuminate decision making. These include game theory, portfolio theory, 
  public finance, culture theory, and simulation exercises, and are discussed 
  in the body of the chapter.</p>
