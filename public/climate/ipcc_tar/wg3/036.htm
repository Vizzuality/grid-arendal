<h1>8 Global, Regional, and National Costs and Ancillary Benefits</h1>
<h2><a name="81"></a>8.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>The UNFCCC (Article 2) has as its ultimate goal the &#147;stabilisation of 
  greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent 
  dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system&#148;<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#14","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>14</a></sup></small>. 
  In addition, the Convention (Article 3.3) states that &#147;policies and measures 
  to deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure global 
  benefits at the lowest possible costs&#148;<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#15","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>15</a></sup></small>. 
  This section reports on literature on the costs of greenhouse gas mitigation 
  policies at the national, regional, and global levels. Net welfare gains or 
  losses are reported, including (when available) the ancillary benefits of mitigation 
  policies. These studies employ the full range of analytical tools described 
  in the previous chapter. These range from technologically detailed bottom-up 
  models to more aggregate top-down models, which link the energy sector to the 
  rest of the economy. </p>
<h2>
  <a name="82"></a>8.2. Gross Costs of GHG Abatement in Technology- Detailed Models</h2>
<p>In technology-detailed &#147;bottom-up&#148; models and approaches, the cost 
  of mitigation is derived from the aggregation of technological and fuel costs 
  such as: investments, operation and maintenance costs, and fuel procurement, 
  but also (and this is a recent trend) revenues and costs from import and exports.</p>
<p>Models can be ranked along two classification axes. First, they range from 
  simple engineering-economics calculations effected technology-by-technology, 
  to integrated partial equilibrium models of whole energy systems. Second, they 
  range from the strict calculation of direct technical costs of reduction to 
  the consideration of observed technology-adoption behaviour of markets, and 
  of the welfare losses due to demand reductions and revenue gains and losses 
  due to changes in trade. </p>
<p>This leads to contrasting two generic approaches, namely the engineering-economics 
  approach and least-cost equilibrium modelling. In the first approach, each technology 
  is assessed independently via an accounting of its costs and savings. Once these 
  elements have been estimated, a unit cost can be calculated for each action, 
  and each action can be ranked according to its costs. This approach is very 
  useful to point out the potentials for negative cost abatements due to the &#145;efficiency 
  gap&#146; between the best available technologies and technologies currently 
  in use. However, its most important limitation is that studies neglect or do 
  not treat in a systematic way the interdependence of the various actions under 
  examination.<br>
  <br>
  Partial equilibrium least-costs models have been constructed to remedy this 
  defect, by considering all actions simultaneously and selecting the optimal 
  bundle of actions in all sectors and at all time periods. These more integrated 
  studies conclude higher total costs of GHG mitigation than the strict technology 
  by technology studies. Based on an optimization framework they give very easily 
  interpretable results that compare an optimal response to an optimal baseline; 
  however, their limitation is that they rarely calibrate the base year of the 
  model to the existing non optimal situation and implicitly assume an optimal 
  baseline. They consequently provide no information about the negative cost potentials. 
</p>
<p>Since the publication of the SAR, the bottom-up approaches have produced a 
  wealth of new results for both Annex I and non-Annex I countries, as well as 
  for groups of countries. Furthermore, they have extended their scope much beyond 
  the classical computations of direct abatement costs by inclusion of demand 
  effects and some trade effects. </p>
<p>However, the modelling results show considerable variations from study to study, 
  which are explained by a number of factors, some of which reflect the widely 
  differing conditions that prevail in the countries studied (e.g., energy endowment, 
  economic growth, energy intensity, industrial and trade structure), and others 
  reflect modelling assumptions and assumptions about negative cost potentials.</p>
<p>However, as in the SAR, there is agreement on a no regrets potential resulting 
  from the reduction of existing market imperfections, consideration of ancillary 
  benefits, and inclusion of double dividends. This means that some mitigation 
  actions can be realized at negative costs. The no regrets potential results 
  from existing market or institutional imperfections that prevent cost-effective 
  emission reduction measures from being taken. The key question is whether such 
  imperfections can be removed cost-effectively by policy measures.</p>
<p>The second important policy message is that short and medium term marginal 
  abatement costs, which govern most of the macroeconomic impacts of climate policies, 
  are very sensitive to uncertainty regarding baseline scenarios (rate of growth 
  and energy intensity) and technical costs. Even with significant negative cost 
  options, marginal costs may rise quickly beyond a certain anticipated mitigation 
  level. This risk is far lower in models allowing for carbon trading. Over the 
  long term this risk is reduced as technical change curbs down the slope of marginal 
  cost curves.</p>
