<h3><a name="421"></a>4.2.1 Historical Land-Use Change in the Tropics</h3>
<h4><a name="4211"></a>4.2.1.1 Trends in Land Use and Changes in Carbon Stocks</h4>
<p>Tropical forests were largely intact until colonial times, when large tracts 
  were removed to provide raw materials for railroads, ships, etc., in the period 
  following the industrial revolution. The loss of tropical forests escalated 
  in the second half of the 20th century. According to the UN Food and Agriculture 
  Organization (FAO, 1996), about 15.4 million ha of natural tropical forests 
  are lost each year. Of this, 42% occurs in Latin America, 31% in Africa, and 
  27% in Asia. Brunner <i>et al</i>. (1998) estimated tropical deforestation at 19.1 
  million ha/yr during the period 1990 to 1995. There has, however, been a large 
  increase in area devoted to forest plantations. By 1990, there were 61.3 million 
  ha under plantations and the rate of establishment is now about 3.2 million 
  ha/yr (FAO, 1996).</p>
<p>As pointed out by the IPCC (IPCC, 1996) global estimates of C emissions from 
  deforestation have remained highly uncertain and show high geographical variability. 
  The magnitude of forest regeneration (particularly secondary forest regrowth 
  and regrowth of abandoned lands) and forest degradation processes is not well 
  documented. Improving the accuracy of these estimates remains an urgent and 
  challenging task (Houghton <i>et al</i>., 2000). </p>
<p>Estimates of C emissions from land-use change and forestry activities in the 
  tropics during the1990s range from 1.1 to 1.7GtC/yr, with a best estimate of 
  1.6GtC/yr (Brown <i>et al</i>., 1996b; Melillo <i>et al</i>., 1993; Bolin <i>et al</i>., 2000). These 
  estimates may change with improved information on biomass densities and land-use 
  conversion. Detailed studies for major tropical countries in the early 1990s, 
  studies that include forest regeneration and afforestation, show lower net emissions 
  for most countries than those from aggregate estimates (Makundi <i>et al</i>., 1998).<br>
  <br>
  A review of scenarios of future land-use changes in the tropics, and their implications 
  for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, shows a wide range of estimates, particularly 
  for the first part of the 21st century, where estimates differ by a factor of 
  14 (Alcamo and Swart, 1998). These disparities reflect a lack of agreement on 
  the definition of deforestation, and a lack of knowledge and agreement on the 
  estimation of C emissions (Alcamo and Swart, 1998). These scenarios can be divided 
  into two groups: in one group emissions decline smoothly after 1990; in the 
  other group emissions increase for a few decades after 1990.</p>
<h4><a name="4212"></a>4.2.1.2 Driving Forces for Land-use Change</h4>
<p>The rates and causes of land-use change vary by region and scale (Kaimowitz 
  and Angelsen, 1998). Deforestation is often considered a one way process, but 
  the landscape is a dynamic mosaic of land uses and vegetation types, with transitions 
  both to and away from forest (Houghton <i>et al</i>., 2000). Natural factors, such 
  as forest fires and pests, as well as socio-economic processes, many of which 
  are not seen at the local level, interact in complex ways, complicating analysis. 
  Understanding the causes of this mosaic of land-use and/or land-cover transitions 
  in order to understand and predict the net effect on deforestation rates and 
  C emissions remains a key research challenge.</p>
<p>Conversion of forests to pasture and cropland has been the most important proximal 
  cause of tropical deforestation. Non-sustainable logging has been the leading 
  factor in parts of Southeast Asia, whereas excessive harvest of wood fuel has 
  been important only in specific sub-country regions and in some African countries 
  (Kaimowitz and Angelsen, 1998). According to Bawa and Dayanandan (1997), the 
  causes (correlates) of deforestation are many and varied, with complex interactions. 
  Overall, Bawa and Dayanandan found that population density, cattle density, 
  and external debt were the key factors. In Africa, the most important factors 
  were extraction of fuelwood and charcoal and demand for cropland; in Asia, it 
  was cropland; and in Latin America, it was cattle density.</p>
Most analyses of land-use change and forestry have concentrated on proximal reasons 
for land-use and/or land-cover change; that is, on land uses such as agriculture, 
pasture, and timber extraction that replace forests. But Meyer and Turner (1992) 
have identified six &#147;underlying&#148; forces: (1) population, (2) level of 
affluence, (3) technology, (4) political economy, (5) political structure, and 
6) attitudes and values. The influence of each varies by region and country. 
<p>The rate of population growth is now apparently declining, but the population, 
  and hence the demand for food and other land services, is still growing (Roberts, 
  1999). Population growth has been widely cited as a major cause of deforestation 
  (Myers, 1989), but the relationship between population and deforestation is 
  not simple. Population growth exerts increasing pressure on resources, but whether 
  these pressures lead to forest degradation or to positive changes (e.g., afforestation, 
  improved forest management, and better technology) depends largely on social 
  structure. Extensive migration may also lead to deforestation and soil erosion. 
  Simplistic assumptions about population and deforestation also do not apply 
  where high population densities and/or growth rates are accompanied by forest 
  conservation and reforestation programmes. In India, for example, deforestation 
  rates have declined since 1980, despite population growth, owing to effective 
  forest conservation legislation (Ravindranath and Hall, 1994).</p>
<p>Patterns that affect land-use are changed by economic development. Affluence 
  usually increases consumption, but it does not necessarily decrease terrestrial 
  C stocks. The maintenance of ecosystems tends to improve with increasing and 
  better distribution of wealth, as well as with proper institutional structures 
  and sound development strategies. The demand for and interest in forests and 
  their services is the driving force for the technological and economic capacity 
  to maintain forests. Also, wealthy societies tend to be urbanized and this may 
  reduce destructive pressures on forests. Technological development provides 
  efficient tools for land-use change and for high-value, alternative uses. Technology 
  can also limit encroachment. As seen by the &#147;green revolution&#148; in 
  agriculture, technological development can increase productivity on intensively 
  managed land, thereby releasing other land areas from agriculture (Waggoner, 
  1994). Nevertheless, there is always the risk of leakage (i.e., tendencies to 
  transfer destructive operations from the developed to less developed areas and 
  countries), or the possibility that technology development and transfer will 
  have positive spillover effects (Brown <i>et al</i>., 2000; Noble <i>et al</i>., 2000)</p>
<p>In many countries, especially those seeking development of frontier areas, 
  subsidies are provided for activities promoting economic development. Land clearing 
  may be subsidized directly or by providing property rights to cleared land. 
  Frontier development is often considered desirable for security or where there 
  is a disputed area.</p>
<p>Land-use change is driven largely by efforts perceived as &#147;best and highest&#148; 
  use of the land. But benefits of the land that are non-market and/or external 
  to the direct user (e.g., watershed protection, biodiversity, and carbon mitigation) 
  may be ignored by land managers. For example, the decision to convert forestland 
  to agriculture may ignore the many external and non-market benefits lost. Moreover, 
  where long-term land rights are insecure, lands may be used to generate short-term 
  benefits, with disregard for long-term benefits.</p>
<p>Factors related to social structure and political economy have not been studied 
  widely, but studies at the country and regional levels suggest that deforestation 
  is favoured by the following factors: growing landlessness and persistent inequalities 
  in access to land, insecure land tenure, land speculation, rising external debt, 
  large-scale expansion in commercial agriculture, erosion of traditional systems 
  of resource management and community control, and widespread migration of impoverished 
  people to ecologically fragile areas (Hecht, 1985; Palo and Uusivuori, 1999; 
  Tole, 1998). </p>
