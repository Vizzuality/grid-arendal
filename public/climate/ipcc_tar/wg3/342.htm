<h4>8.3.1.2 Impacts of Caps on the Use of Trading </h4>
<p>From the above results, it is seen that all OECD countries have an interest 
  in making the market as large as possible. Some Parties to the UNFCCC, however, 
  have suggested that the supplementarity conditions of Articles 6.1.d, 12 and 
  17 of the Kyoto Protocol be translated into quantitative limits placed on the 
  extent that Annex I countries can satisfy their obligations through the purchase 
  of emission quotas. The rationale for the supplementarity condition is that, 
  if the price of permits were too low, this would discourage domestic action 
  on structural variables (infrastructure, transportation) or on innovation apt 
  to modify the emissions trends over the long run. These measures are very often 
  liable to high transaction costs and governments may prefer to import additional 
  emissions permits instead of adopting such measures. In other words, minimization 
  of the costs of achieving Kyoto targets may not guarantee minimization of the 
  costs of climate policies over the long run; this is the case when the inertia 
  of technical systems is considered (Ha-Duong<i> et al., </i>1999) and when one 
  accounts for the long term benefits of inducing technical change through abatements 
  in the first period (Glueck and Schleicher, 1995). </p>
<p>Some works have studied the consequences of enforcing the supplementarity condition 
  through quantitative limits: one of the EMF scenarios imposed a constraint on 
  the extent to which a region could satisfy its obligations through the purchase 
  of emission quota (the limit was one-third).</p>

<p><a name="fig8-11"></a>However, the models cannot deliver any response without 
  an assumption about <i>ex ante</i> limits on carbon trading, resulting into 
  a stable duopoly between Russia and Ukraine or into a monopsony (Ellerman and 
  Sue Wing, 2000). In the first case, the price of carbon will be higher than 
  in a non-restricted market, and most of the additional burden will fall on countries 
  in which the marginal cost curve is high because they have a lesser potential 
  for cheap abatement. This is typically the case for Japan and most of the European 
  countries (Hourcade e<i>t al.,</i> 2000b). The other possibility is for the 
  market power to be controlled by the carbon-importing countries; in this case, 
  the risk is that all or most of the trading will be of &#147;hot air&#148; at 
  a very low price. Which of these alternatives will be realized cannot be predicted 
  but, in both cases, quantitative limits to trade lead to outcomes that contradict 
  the very objective of the supplementarity condition. Criqui <i>et al. </i>(1999) 
  assessed the order of magnitude at stake with the POLES model, and examined 
  a scenario in which the carbon tax is US$60/tC with unrestricted trade. They 
  found that the carbon prices under the concrete ceiling conditions proposed 
  by the EU fall to zero (with no market left for the developing countries) if 
  the market power is held by the buyers. Alternatively, the carbon prices increase 
  up to US$150/tC if the market power is held by the sellers, this risk being 
  increased in the case of caps on hot air trading which increases the monopolistic 
  power of Russia and Ukraine. B&ouml;hringer (2000) assesses the economic implications 
  of the EU cap proposal within competitive permit markets. He concludes that 
  part of the efficiency gains from unrestricted permit trade could be used to 
  pay for higher abatement targets of Annex-B countries which assure the same 
  environmental effectiveness as compared to restricted permit trade but still 
  leaves countries better off in welfare terms.</p>
<h4><a name="8313"></a>8.3.1.3 The Double Bubble</h4>
<p>Here the case of the &#147;double bubble&#148; is examined, in which countries 
  belonging to the EU have a collective target, making use of the flexibilty to 
  shift emission quota within the group and the remaining Annex I countries trade 
  among themselves to reach their individual targets.</p>
<p><a href="#fig8-11">Figure 8.11</a> shows the incremental value of carbon emission 
  for the two groups and compares them with that of full Annex I trading. Notice 
  that for the USA, the tax is lower in the case of the &#147;double bubble&#148; 
  than with Annex I trading. The reason is that without the EU bidding for the 
  Russian &#147;hot air&#148;, the demand for emission quotas falls as does its 
  price. The EU on the other hand is disadvantaged under such a scenario. With 
  their access to low cost emission quotas limited, the incremental value rises.<br>
