<h4>2.5.2.5 Summary of Post-SRES Scenario Review </h4>
<p>A new type of policy assessment has been conducted by the post-SRES activities, 
  with nine modelling teams quantifying various simulation cases. Even though 
  stabilization scenarios show a range among the models, several common trends 
  and characteristics can be observed.</p>
<p>The different SRES baseline worlds require different technology and/or policy 
  measures to stabilize at the same level. The A1F1, A1B, and A2 worlds require 
  a wider range of stronger technology and/or policy measures than A1T, B1, and 
  B2. For example, energy efficiency improvements in all sectors, the introduction 
  of low-carbon energy, and afforestation would all be required in the A1F1, A1B, 
  and A2 worlds in the first half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, with the additional 
  introduction of advanced technologies in renewable energy and other energy sources 
  in the second half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The level of technology and/or 
  policy measures in the beginning of this century would be significantly affected 
  by the choice of development path over the next one hundred years. Higher emission 
  worlds such as A1F1 and A2 require earlier reduction than low emission worlds 
  such as A1T and B1. </p>
<p>The stabilization level chosen also significantly affects technology and/or 
  policy measures and the timing of their introduction. More stringent stabilization 
  targets require earlier emission reductions from baseline levels. The post-SRES 
  scenario analysis suggests that stabilization at 450ppmv will require emissions 
  reductions in Annex I countries that go significantly beyond the Kyoto Protocol 
  commitments. It also suggests that maintaining emissions at the level of the 
  Kyoto commitments may be adequate for achieving stabilization at 550ppmv or 
  higher, although it should be recognized that several scenarios do indicate 
  the need for significant emission reductions by 2020 in order to achieve these 
  stabilization levels.</p>
<p>With respect to the important policy question of the role of developing countries 
  in GHG emission mitigation, a preliminary finding of the post-SRES scenario 
  analysis is that, assuming that the CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction needed 
  for stabilization occurs in Annex I countries only, per capita CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions in Annex I countries would fall below per capita emissions in non-Annex 
  I countries during the 21<sup>st</sup> century except in some of A1T and B1 
  stabilization scenarios, and this occurs before 2050 in two-thirds of the scenarios. 
  This suggests that, especially for more stringent stabilization targets and/or 
  worlds with relatively high baseline emissions, there is a need for emissions 
  to diverge from baseline levels in developing countries. The stabilization target 
  and the baseline emission level were both important determinants of the timing 
  when developing countries emissions might need to diverge from their baseline 
  emissions.</p>
<p>No single measure will be sufficient for the timely development, adoption, 
  and diffusion of mitigation options to stabilize atmospheric GHGs. Rather, a 
  portfolio based on technological change, economic incentives, and institutional 
  frameworks might be adopted. Large and continuous energy efficiency improvements 
  and afforestation are common features of mitigation scenarios in all the different 
  SRES worlds. Introduction of low-carbon energy is also a common feature of all 
  scenarios, especially biomass energy introduction over the next one hundred 
  years, as well as natural gas introduction in the first half of the 21<sup>st</sup> 
  century. Reductions in the carbon intensity of energy have a greater mitigation 
  potential than reductions in the energy intensity of GDP in the latter half 
  of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, while energy intensity reduction is greater 
  than carbon intensity reduction in the beginning of the century. This result 
  appears to be robust across the storylines and stabilization levels, if drastic 
  social changes are not assumed for energy efficiency improvement. In an A1B 
  or A2 world, either nuclear power or carbon sequestration would become increasingly 
  important for GHG concentration stabilization, the more so if stabilization 
  targets are lower. Solar energy could play an important role in climate stabilization 
  in the latter half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, especially for a higher emission 
  baseline or lower stabilization levels.</p>
<p>Robust policy and/or technological options include technological efficiency 
  improvements for energy supply and use, social efficiency improvements, renewable 
  energy incentives, and the introduction of energy price incentives such as a 
  carbon tax. Energy conservation and reforestation are reasonable first steps, 
  but innovative supply-side technologies will eventually be required to achieve 
  stabilization of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Possibilities include 
  using natural gas and combined-cycle technology to bridge the transition to 
  more advanced fossil (fuel) and zero-carbon technologies such as hydrogen fuel 
  cells. However, even with emissions control, some modellers found that energy 
  systems would still be dependent on fossil fuels over the next century.</p>
<p>Integration between global climate policies and domestic air pollution abatement 
  policies could effectively reduce GHG emissions in developing regions for the 
  next two or three decades. However, control of sulphur emissions could amplify 
  possible climate change, and partial trade-offs are likely to persist for environmental 
  policies in the medium term.</p>
<p>Policies governing agriculture and land use and energy systems need to be linked 
  for climate change mitigation. Failure to do this can lead to much larger than 
  necessary costs. At tight levels of control, even some ability to acquire additional 
  emissions capacity from land sequestration can have major cost-reducing impacts. 
  Moreover, a high potential supply of biomass energy would ameliorate the burden 
  of carbon emission reductions.</p>
