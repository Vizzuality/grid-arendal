<h4>8.2.2.2 Mitigating Sectoral Implications: Tax Exemptions, Grandfathered Emission 
  Permits, and Voluntary Agreements</h4>
<p>In all countries in which CO<sub>2</sub> taxes have been introduced, some sectors 
  are exempt, or the tax is differentiated across sectors (see, e.g., ECON, 1997). 
  Typically, households pay the full tax rate, whereas export-oriented industries 
  pay either nothing or a symbolic rate<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>3</sup></small></a>. 
  Very few countries have actually implemented a CO<sub>2</sub> tax, and (unsurprisingly) 
  tax exemptions are more systematically analyzed in these countries, such as 
  the Scandinavian countries. Concerns about the sectoral implications of revenue-raising 
  policies have led to four types of responses being studied:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>exemption of the most carbon-intensive activities;<br>
  </li>
  <li>differentiating the carbon tax across sectors;<br>
  </li>
  <li>compensation subsidies; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>government&#146;s free provision of emissions permits to firms on a grandfathering 
    basis or on the basis of voluntary agreements on sectoral objectives.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="82221"></a>8.2.2.2.1 Tax Exemption</h4>
<p>Lessons from the few modelling exercises suggest that the efficiency cost for 
  the whole economy of offsetting the sectoral impacts of carbon taxes through 
  tax exemptions are very high. B&ouml;hringer and Rutherford (1997) show for 
  Germany that exemptions to energy- and export-intensive industries increase 
  the costs of meeting a 30% CO<sub>2</sub> reduction target by more than 20%. 
  Jensen (1998) has similar findings for Denmark with respect to a unilateral 
  reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 20% (Jensen, 1998). To exempt six production 
  sectors that emit 15% of Denmark&#146;s total emissions implies significantly 
  greater welfare costs (equivalent variation) than full taxation to meet the 
  same abatement target. Namely, welfare loss of 1.9% and a carbon tax on the 
  non-exempted sectors of US$70/tCO<sub>2</sub>, against a welfare loss of 1.2% 
  and a carbon price of US$40/tCO<sub>2</sub> in the no-exemption case (uniform 
  taxes). A similar result is found in Hill (1999) for Sweden: the welfare costs 
  of using exemptions are more than 2.5 times higher than in the uniform carbon 
  tax case for a 10% emission decrease. The high costs of tax exemption are also 
  confirmed by a US study (Babiker <i>et al.,</i> 2000).</p>
<h4><a name="82222"></a>8.2.2.2.2 Tax Differentiation</h4>
<p>Tax differentiation is studied in a CGE model for Sweden in Bergman (1995), 
  who compares its effect with a uniform tax for given emission targets. The tax 
  rate applicable to the industrial firms is set to one-quarter of the tax rate 
  for non-industrial firms and households. The GDP loss increases slightly compared 
  to the uniform tax, but it is still quite small. However, the purchasing power 
  of the aggregated incomes of labour and capital is significantly reduced. Consequently, 
  tax differentiation does not seem to have as much of an adverse effect as full 
  tax exemption. The reason is that all sectors pay a carbon tax when taxes are 
  differentiated, while this is not the case for tax exemptions. Thus, the burden 
  on sectors that pay the highest carbon tax is not that large, and hence results 
  in lower welfare losses. </p>
<h4><a name="82223"></a>8.2.2.2.3 Compensating or Subsidizing Mitigation Measures</h4>
<p>B&ouml;hringer and Rutherford (1997) as well as Hill (1999) envisage labour 
  subsidies used to keep a given employment target. They conclude that &#150; 
  compared to tax exemptions for energy- and export-intensive industries &#150; 
  a uniform carbon tax cum wage subsidy achieves an identical level of national 
  emission reduction and employment at a fraction of the costs.</p>
<p>A second option is a special case of voluntary agreements. In most of the literature, 
  voluntary agreements result from negotiations on emission levels between public 
  authorities and firms adversely impacted by environment policies. Carraro and 
  Galeotti (1995) examined another form of voluntary agreement for European countries: 
  firms receive financial benefits if they have engaged in environmental research 
  and development (R&amp;D) spending. This option is justified because economic 
  tools may be inefficient in reaching the optimal R&amp;D level, even in a pure 
  and perfect market competition (Laffont and Tirole, 1993). According to this 
  study, a strong double dividend could occur in all European countries except 
  Belgium and the UK, even if the impact on employment is weak. One of the reasons 
  for this double dividend is the technical progress induced by this policy.<br>
