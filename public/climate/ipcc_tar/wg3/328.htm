<h4>8.2.2.1.2 Carbon Taxes and Reducing Payroll Taxes</h4>
<p><a href="#fig8-5">Figure 8.5 </a>plots the range of the numerical findings 
  for a wide set of countries. In comparison with the previous results, these 
  findings are far more optimistic. This confirms the theoretical results that 
  the gross costs of meeting given abatement targets can be significantly reduced 
  by using the revenue of carbon taxes to finance cuts in the existing distortionary 
  taxes, instead of returning the revenues to the economy in a lump-sum fashion. 
  Only a few studies provide results that allow for a systematic assessment of 
  the attractiveness of payroll recycling through comparing its welfare implication 
  with that of lump-sum recycling. For Norway, H&aring;konsen and Mathiesen (1997) 
  use a static computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to compare lump-sum 
  recycling to private households and a reduction in employers&#146; social security 
  contributions. Welfare is measured by a combined index of commodity and leisure 
  consumption. When CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are reduced by 20% (i.e., stabilizing 
  emissions in 2000 at the 1990 level), welfare is reduced by 1% with lump-sum 
  recycling, but only by 0.3% when tax income is used to reduce social security 
  contributions. These authors also found ancillary benefits that decrease welfare 
  losses even further (see <a href="334.htm">Section 8.2.4</a> below). <a name="fig8-5"></a></p>

  <p align="left">In this report, it is impossible to identify all the sources 
    of discrepancies in results across models. Only the differences between results 
    concerning the USA and European economies are considered. These discrepancies 
    arise because labour taxes represent one of the most important sources of 
    distortion in European countries as a result of the pre-existing tax structure 
    and of the type of labour-market regulation that prevails in these countries. 
    Note that a systematic outcome of these studies is that an increase in employment 
    is easier to obtain than an increase in total consumption or social welfare, 
    which leads some authors to discuss the employment double dividend as distinct 
    from the efficiency dividend.</p>
</div>
<p>While studies conclude that the swap between carbon and payroll taxes reduces 
  the net burden of climate policies but does not avoid net welfare losses in 
  the USA (Goulder 1995b; Jorgenson and Wilcoxen, 1995; Shackleton <i><i>et al</i>.,</i> 
  1996), a strong double dividend often occurs in Europe. As suggested by theoretical 
  analyses (Carraro and Soubeyran, 1996), these differences can be explained by 
  the differences both in taxation systems and in the rigidities of the labour 
  markets. Capros <i><i>et al</i>. </i>(1999b) demonstrate <a href="#fig8-6">(Figure 
  8.6)</a> that the increase of employment in the EU countries due to payroll 
  tax reduction is far higher under the assumption of wage rigidities than under 
  the assumption of a classic flexible labour market. In the same way, Bernard 
  and Vielle (1999c) do not conclude to a strong double dividend in France, while 
  Hourcade <i><i>et al</i>.</i> (2000a) find a modest increase in total consumption of 
  households (up to 0.2% for carbon taxes up to US$100/tC) because they incorporate 
  structural unemployment. This is also why the E3ME model (Barker, 1999), econometrically 
  driven and neo-Keynesian in nature, provides the most optimistic results; they 
  indeed incorporate the rigidities of the real labour markets. It systematically 
  finds a net increase in GDP in Europe (from 0.8% to 2.2%), except for the Netherlands, 
  with a maximum in the UK. The DRI and LINK models, similar in nature to E3M3, 
  do not find such a gain for the US economy, but a loss of 0.39%.<a name="fig8-6"></a></p>

  </table>
  <div align="left">The magnitude of the double dividend for the European countries 
    is lower in general equilibrium models than in Keynesian models: the welfare 
    effects in different studies are between &#150;1.35% and 0.57%. Even if these 
    estimates cover different emission reduction levels for different time periods, 
    they confirm the attractiveness of payroll recycling. In addition, it is remarkable 
    that negative figures are found for small economies such as Belgium (Proost 
    and van Regemorter, 1995) and Denmark (Andersen <i><i>et al</i>.,</i> 1998) in the 
    situation of a unilateral policy, which confirms the specific interest of 
    these countries in international coordination. <br>
  </div>
</div>
<p>The magnitude of the second dividend (the net economic benefit of tax recycling) 
  is not independent of the abatement target. For a given fiscal system, it is 
  determined by parameters for which sizes vary with the taxation levels (e.g., 
  the elasticity of decarbonization in the production sector and in household 
  consumption, the crowding-out effect between carbon-saving technological change 
  and non-biased technological change). Unfortunately, only a few studies report 
  the range of taxes in which the double-dividend hypothesis holds. Hourcade <i>et al</i>. (2000a) found a curve similar to A<sub>3</sub> in <a href="326.htm#fig8-3">Figure 
  8.3;</a> after an optimum around US$100/tC, the double dividend tends to vanish 
  in the same way. H&aring;konsen and Mathiesen (1997) found that tax recycling 
  is actually welfare improving in the range of a 5% to 15% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions. Capros <i><i>et al</i>.</i> (1999c) are more optimistic in this respect. 
  They found that the final consumption of households in the EU is increases (about 
  1%) when the abatement target increases from 20% to 25%. The marginal increase 
  is, however, lower than when the abatement target increases from 5% to 10%.</p>
<h4><a name="82213"></a>8.2.2.1.3 Other Forms of Taxes Reduction </h4>
<p>Other forms of tax reductions, such as value-added tax (VAT), capital taxes, 
  and other indirect taxes have also been studied in addition to recycling via 
  the national debt and public deficit reductions.</p>
<p>Studies for the USA confirm that the nature of the existing fiscal system matters. 
  While no study found a strong double dividend for the USA in the case of labour-tax 
  recycling, the Jorgenson&#150;Wilcoxen model supports this notion when recycling 
  takes the form of a reduction in capital taxes (Shackleton, 1998). The pre-existing 
  marginal distortions from taxes on capital are considerably larger than those 
  from labour taxes. Consequently, according to Jorgenson (1997), if the revenues 
  were rebated to consumers in the form of reduced taxes on wage and salary incomes, 
  the cost would be reduced to 0.6%, or by a factor of three compared to the lump-sum 
  recycling case. But if the taxes were rebated on capital income instead, the 
  loss would turn into a gain (0.19%). This higher attractiveness of capital taxation 
  recycling is not found in European countries, with the exception of the Newage 
  model for Germany (Boehringer, 1997).<a name="fig8-7"></a></p>

  <p align="left">The other recycling modes have been scrutinized less systematically, 
    but yield in general less favourable results than labour- and capital-taxation 
    recycling. <a href="#fig8-7">Figure 8.7 </a>synthetises these results. For 
    Australia, McDougall and Dixon (1996) found that for all the scenarios in 
    which energy taxes were used to offset reductions in payroll taxes, rises 
    in GDP and employment were achieved. A decrease in GDP and employment resulted 
    in the only scenario in which energy taxes were used to reduce the budget 
    deficit. Fitz Gerald and McCoy (1992) found the same type of result for repayment 
    of national debt in Ireland (1% GDP loss). These results are also confirmed 
    in the German case, which is particularly interesting, because several models 
    (Almon, 1991; Welsch and Hoster, 1995; Conrad and Schmidt, 1997; Boehringer 
    <i><i>et al</i>., </i>1997) simulate the same emission target (&#150;25%) for the 
    same year (2010) with different types of recycling. They generally conclude 
    to a strong double dividend, and they find a significantly more pessimistic 
    variation in welfare (&#150;4.2% against &#150;0.7% in Almon (1991), &#150;0.03% 
    against +0.1% in Conrad and Schmidt (1996)) when the revenues of the carbon 
    tax are used to lower public deficit rather than reduce social contribution. 
    The results are less clear concerning the relevance of recycling via a capital 
    tax reduction in this country.</p>
</div>
<p>For France, Schubert and Beaumais (1998) found, for a carbon tax of US$140/tC, 
  that these tax recycling schemes are less efficient in terms of welfare than 
  recycling through payroll tax, because they trigger no mechanism that enhances 
  employment and general activity. Bernard and Vielle (1999c) confirm this result 
  for the same country. In a short-run analysis for Sweden, Br&auml;nnlund and 
  Gren (1999) found that private income remains almost unchanged if a reduction 
  in VAT is implemented, because it compensates the regressive income effect of 
  carbon taxation. Nevertheless, as the income increase in this study is relatively 
  important compared to the changes in prices, taxes can be raised without altering 
  consumer behaviour in any considerable way. But this balance may not be preserved 
  in the case of higher carbon taxes.</p>
<p>There are few studies on mitigation costs and recycling for developing countries, 
  but China is one exception. Zhang (1997, 1998) analyzed the implications of 
  two scenarios under which China&#146;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2010 will 
  be cut by 20% and 30% relative to the baseline. Gross National Product drops 
  by 1.5% and 2.8%, respectively, in 2010 relative to the baseline, and welfare, 
  measured in Hicksian equivalent variation (defined in <a href="266.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>), drops by 1.1% and 1.8%. If part of the revenues raised by carbon taxes 
  is recycled by equally reducing indirect taxes by 5% and 10%, respectively, 
  for all sectors the welfare effect is markedly improved, and there may even 
  be a gain. Garbaccio <i><i>et al</i>.</i> (1998) report an even more optimistic view 
  from their simulations on a dynamic CGE model for China. Uniform emissions reductions 
  of 5%, 10%, and 15% from baseline were studied, and carbon tax revenues recycled 
  by reducing all other taxes proportionally. In all of the alternative scenarios, 
  a very small decline in GDP occurs in the first year of the simulation. However, 
  in each case, GDP is increased in every year thereafter. The result arises through 
  a shift from consumption to investment brought about indirectly through the 
  imposition of the carbon tax. Thus, a double dividend may be achieved in China.<br>
