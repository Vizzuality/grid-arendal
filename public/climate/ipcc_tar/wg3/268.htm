<h2><a name="71"></a>7.1 Introduction </h2>
<h3><a name="711"></a>7.1.1 Background and Structure of the Chapter</h3>
<p>This chapter addresses the methodological issues that arise in the estimation 
  of the monetary costs of climate change. The focus here is on the correct assessment 
  of the costs of mitigation measures to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases 
  (GHGs). The other two areas in which cost issues arise are the estimation of 
  the climate change impacts in monetary terms, and the assessment of measures 
  to adapt to climate change. Working Group II (WGII) is charged with the responsibility 
  to evaluate the impacts and adaptation measures. It is important, though, that 
  much of the discussion in this chapter is relevant to these areas. The basic 
  principles of cost estimation certainly apply in all three areas. Moreover, 
  some of the key issues in cost estimation that arise in the assessment of impacts 
  are also relevant to the estimation of the costs of mitigation. Hence, the relationship 
  between the costs discussed by WGII and those discussed by WGIII is close.</p>
<p>The chapter begins by providing the background to this assessment report; by 
  giving a summary of the Second Assessment Report (SAR) and of the developments 
  in the literature since SAR (IPCC, 1996a, 1996b). <a href="271.htm">Section 
  7.2</a> discusses the elements in any climate change cost estimation. It begins 
  by setting out the decision-making framework for mitigation decisions. Unfortunately, 
  this framework is complex, as it involves the application of different modelling 
  techniques and assumptions. Important within the framework are issues of ancillary 
  and co-benefits of climate change mitigation, evaluation techniques, the treatment 
  of barrier removal and implementation costs, discounting, and the linkages between 
  adaptation and mitigation. The conventional cost-effectiveness and the cost&#150;benefit 
  tools used for making decisions to reduce GHGs, or to select adaptation measures, 
  provide only part of the information required by the decision maker. The extensions 
  that are currently being discussed, and used in some cases, include the valuation 
  of external effects, and considerations of equity and sustainability. The outline 
  of the extended decision-making framework and its relationship to the cost methodology 
  is discussed in <a href="271.htm#721">Sections 7.2.1</a> to <a href="281.htm">7.2.5</a>. 
</p>
<p><a href="283.htm">Section 7.3</a> discusses the critical assumptions made in 
  the application of the methodology to climate change problems. The key issues 
  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>different systems in which the cost analysis is carried out&#150;project 
    sector and macro level;<br>
  </li>
  <li>determination of baselines;<br>
  </li>
  <li>treatment of technological change;<br>
  </li>
  <li>assessment of cost implications of including alternative GHG emission reduction 
    options and carbon sinks; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>treatment of uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="295.htm">Section 7.4</a> covers the practical problems that arise 
  in cost estimation, particularly relating to the linkages between the &#147;micro&#148; 
  cost exercise and the broader &#147;macro&#148; picture. The problems covered 
  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>relationship to objectives of development, equity, and sustainability (DES);<br>
  </li>
  <li>income and other macroeconomic effects of mitigation and adaptation policies;<br>
  </li>
  <li>issues of spillovers;<br>
  </li>
  <li>treatment of equity; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>treatment of future costs and sustainability issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="304.htm">Section 7.5</a> considers the special issues that arise in 
  the estimation of costs in developing countries and economies in transition 
  (EITs). </p>
<p><a href="309.htm">Section 7.6</a> discusses the relationship between the cost 
  assessment methodology and the models used to estimate mitigation costs. Issues 
  discussed include classification of models (<a href="309.htm#762">Section 7.6.2</a>), 
  top-down and bottom-up models (<a href="310.htm">Section 7.6.3</a>) integrated 
  assessment models (IAMs; <a href="311.htm">Section 7.6.4</a>), categorization 
  of climate change mitigation options (<a href="312.htm">Section 7.6.5</a>), 
  and critical assumptions (<a href="313.htm">Section 7.6.6</a>).<br>

  7.1</a> overlaps with <a href="379.htm">Chapter 10</a>, <a href="271.htm">Section 
  7.2</a> with <a href="224.htm">Chapter 6</a>, and <a href="309.htm">Section 
  7.6</a> with <a href="319.htm">Chapters 8</a> and <a href="353.htm">9</a>.</p>
