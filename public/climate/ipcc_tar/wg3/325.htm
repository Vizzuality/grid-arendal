<h4>8.2.1.4 Common Messages from Bottom-up Results </h4>
<p>Clearly, the impact of policy scenarios has a large influence on abatement 
  costs. Certain studies propose a series of public measures (regulatory and economic) 
  that tap deep into the technical potential of low carbon and/or energy-efficient 
  technologies. In many cases, such policies show low or negative costs. A comparison 
  with least-cost approaches is difficult because these evaluate systematically 
  both the baseline and the policy scenario as optimized systems and do not incorporate 
  market or institutional imperfections in the current world. It would be of great 
  interest to conduct a more systematic comparison of the results obtained via 
  the various B-U approaches, so as to establish the true cause of the discrepancies 
  in reported costs. A timid step in this direction is illustrated in Loulou and 
  Kanudia (1999a).</p>
<p>This leads to a general discussion about the extent to which all these results 
  suffer from a lack of representation of transaction costs, which are usually 
  incurred in the process of switching technologies or fuels. This category of 
  transaction cost encompasses many implementation difficulties that are very 
  hard to capture numerically. The general conclusion from SAR (that costs computed 
  using the B-U approach are usually on the low side compared to costs computed 
  via econometric models, which assume a history-based behaviour of the economic 
  agents) is no longer generally applicable, since some B-U models take a more 
  behavioural approach. Models such as ISTUM, NEMS, PRIMES, or AIM implicitly 
  acknowledge at least some transaction costs via various mechanisms, with the 
  result that market share is not determined by visible (market-based) least-cost 
  alone. Least-cost modellers (using MARKAL, EFOM, MESSAGE, ETO) also attempt 
  to impose penetration bounds, or industry-specific discount rates, which approximately 
  represent the unknown transaction costs and other manifestations of resistance 
  to change exhibited by economic agents. In both cases these improvements result 
  in partially eschewing the &#147;sin&#148; of optimism and blur the division 
  between B-U and T-D models. While the former, indeed, tend to be less optimistic 
  when they account for real behaviours, it is symmetrically arguable that the 
  latter underestimate the possibility of altering these behaviours through judicious 
  policies or better information. All this area still remains underworked.</p>
<p>A common message is the attention that must to be paid to the marginal cost 
  curve. Despite the limitations and differences in results discussed above, B-U 
  analyses convey important information that lies beyond the scope of T-D models, 
  by computing both the total cost of policies and their marginal cost. Very often, 
  indeed, the marginal abatement cost of a given target is high, although the 
  average abatement cost is reasonably low, or even negative. This is because 
  the initial reductions of GHG emissions may have a very low (or negative) cost, 
  whereas additional reductions have, in general, a much higher marginal cost. 
  This fact is captured in the curve representing marginal abatement cost versus 
  reduction quantity, which starts with negative marginal costs, as illustrated 
  in <a href="323.htm#fig8-1">Figure 8.1.</a> The initial portion of the curve 
  (section A&#150;B) exhibits negative cost options, which may add up to a significant 
  portion of the reductions targetted by a given GHG scenario. As the reduction 
  target increases (section B&#150;C&#150;D of the curve), the marginal cost becomes 
  positive, and also eventually the total mitigation cost if the reduction target 
  is large enough. But there is systematically a wedge between the marginal and 
  total costs of abatement, and this wedge is all the more important as the macroeconomic 
  impacts of climate policies are driven in large part by the marginal costs (because 
  the latter dictate the change in relative commodity prices). They are driven 
  only modestly by the total amount of abatement expenditures.</p>
<p>A crucial, albeit indirect, message, is the importance of innovation: indeed, 
  B-U models depend on a reasonable representation of emerging or future technologies. 
  When this representation is deficient, the models present a pessimistic view 
  of the costs of more drastic abatements in the long term. This issue is not 
  one of the modelling paradigm, but rather of feeding the models with good estimates 
  of technical progress. Some works are currently underway to make explicit the 
  drivers of technical change, such as learning-by-doing (LBD) or uncertainty. 
  These studies are discussed further in <a href="346.htm">Section 8.4.</a><br>
