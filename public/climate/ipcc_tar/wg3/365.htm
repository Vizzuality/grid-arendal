<h4>9.2.4.3 Ancillary Benefits Associated with Mitigation in the Electricity Industry<br>
</h4>
<p>The ancillary benefits expected from the increased use of new generating technologies 
  adopted to achieve GHG mitigation would be sales and employment growth for those 
  who manufacture and construct the new generation facilities. There could also 
  be income and employment growth in the production of fuels for this new generation. 
  The ancillary benefits associated with use of non-fossil energy for thermal 
  applications would be similar.<br>
</p>
<p>Ancillary benefits of increased use of renewable sources have been described 
  by several experts (Brower, 1992; Johansson <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1993; Pimental 
  <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1994; Miyamoto, 1997). These include:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>further social and economic development, such as enhanced employment opportunities 
    in rural areas, which can help reduce rural poverty and decrease the pressures 
    to migrate to urban areas;</li>
  <li>and restoration activities such as improvement of degraded lands and associated 
    positive impacts on farm economics, new rural development opportunities, prevention 
    of erosion, habitats for wildlife;<br>
  </li>
  <li>reduced emissions, in certain instances, of local pollutants;</li>
  <li>potential for fuel diversity; and</li>
  <li>elimination of the need for costly disposal of waste materials, such as 
    crop residues and household refuse.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="9244"></a>9.2.4.4 Ancillary Costs Associated with Mitigation in the 
  Electricity Industry </h4>
<p>There are also ancillary costs associated with actions to mitigate GHGs in 
  the electricity sector. The growth experienced by those who benefit from mitigation 
  would be offset by a decline in sales and employment for those who would have 
  produced and constructed the facilities that would have been built without the 
  mitigation activity. Similarly, there will be a loss of income and jobs for 
  those that would have provided the fuel for those facilities no longer being 
  built (i.e., the coal industry). The specifics of the mitigation policy and 
  action will effect whether the net effect of this shifting of economic activity 
  will be positive or negative.</p>
<p>There are also environmental issues associated with some of the renewable technologies. 
  For example, concern has been raised about the ecological impacts of intensive 
  cultivation of biomass for energy, the loss of land and other negative impacts 
  of hydro electricity development, and the noise, visual interference, and potential 
  for killing birds associated with wind generation (Brower, 1992; Pimental <i><i>et 
  al</i></i>., 1994; IEA, 1997a; Miyamoto, 1997; IEA, 1998a). </p>
<p>Nuclear power might be expected to increase substantially as a result of GHG 
  mitigation policies, because power from nuclear fuel produces negligible GHGs. 
  The construction of nuclear power stations, however, does lead to GHG emissions, 
  but over the lifecycle of the plant these are much lower than those from comparable 
  fossil fuel stations. <br>
</p>
<p>In spite of the advantages, nuclear power is not seen as the solution to the 
  global warming problem in many countries. The main issues are (1) the high costs 
  compared to alternative combined cycle gas turbines, (2) public concerns about 
  operating safety and waste disposal, (3) safety of radioactive waste management 
  and recycling of nuclear fuel, (4) the risks of nuclear fuel storage and transportation, 
  and (5) nuclear weapon proliferation (Hagan, 1998). Whether the full potential 
  for nuclear power development to reduce GHGs can be realized will be determined 
  by political and public responses and safety management.</p>
