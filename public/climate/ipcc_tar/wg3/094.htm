<h2>3.3.4 New Technological and Other Options</h2>
<p>There are myriad opportunities for energy efficiency improvement in buildings 
  (Acosta Moreno <i>et al</i>., 1996; Interlaboratory Working Group, 1997; Nadel <i>et al</i>., 
  1998) (see <a href="#tab33">Table 3.3</a>). Most of these technologies and measures 
  are commercialized but are not fully implemented in residential and commercial 
  buildings, while some have only recently been developed and will begin to penetrate 
  the market as existing buildings are retrofitted and new buildings are designed 
  and constructed.</p>
<p>A recent study identified over 200 emerging technologies and measures to improve 
  energy efficiency and reduce energy use in the residential and commercial sectors 
  (Nadel <i>et al</i>., 1998). Individual country studies also identify many technologies 
  and measures to improve the energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
  from the buildings sector in particular climates and regions.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#9","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>9</sup></small></a> 
  For example, a study for South Africa discusses 15 options for the residential 
  sector and 11 options for the commercial sector (Roos, 2000). Examples of other 
  studies that identify energy efficiency or greenhouse gas mitigation options 
  for the buildings sector include those for Brazil (Schaeffer and Almeida, 1999), 
  Bulgaria (Tzvetanov <i>et al</i>, 1997), Canada (Bailie <i>et al</i>., 1998); China (Research 
  Team of China Climate Change Country Study, 1999); Czech Republic (Tichy, 1997), 
  the European Union (Blok <i>et al</i>., 1996; van Velsen <i>et al</i>., 1998), India (Asian 
  Development Bank, 1998), Indonesia (Cahyono Adi <i>et al</i>., 1997), Mexico (Mendoza 
  <i>et al</i>., 1991), Poland (Gaj and Sadowski, 1997); Ukraine (Raptsoun and Parasyuk, 
  1997), and the US (Interlaboratory Working Group, 1997; National Laboratory 
  Directors, 1997; STAPPA/ALAPCO, 1999). Below examples are given of three new 
  developments out of many that could be cited: integrated building design, reducing 
  standby power losses in appliances and equipment, and photovoltaic systems for 
  residential and commercial buildings. These examples focus on options for reducing 
  greenhouse gas emissions from the buildings sector in which there has been significant 
  recent research: improving the building shell, improving building equipment 
  and appliances, and switching to lower carbon fuels to condition the air and 
  power the equipment and appliances in buildings. In addition, recent developments 
  in distributed power generation for buildings are briefly described (see also 
  <a href="138.htm#3853">Section 3.8.5.3</a>).</p>

<h4>3.3.4.1 Integrated Building Design</h4>
<p>Integrated building design focuses on exploiting energy-saving opportunities 
  associated with building siting as well as synergies between building components 
  such as windows, insulation, equipment, and heating, air conditioning, and ventilation 
  systems. Installing increased insulation and energy-efficient windows, for example, 
  allows for installation of smaller heating and cooling equipment and reduced 
  or eliminated ductwork.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>10</sup></small></a> 
  Most importantly, it will become possible in the future to design a building 
  where operation can be monitored, controlled, and faults detected and analyzed 
  automatically. For large commercial buildings, such systems (which are currently 
  under development) have the potential to create significant energy savings as 
  well as other operational benefits. Two recent projects that used integrated 
  building design for residential construction found average energy savings between 
  30% and 60% per cent (Elberling and Bourne, 1996; Hoeschele <i>et al</i>., 1996; Parker 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996), while for commercial buildings energy savings have varied between 
  13% and 71% (Piette <i>et al</i>., 1996; Hernandez <i>et al</i>., 1998; Parker <i>et al</i>., 1997; 
  Thayer, 1995; Suozzo and Nadel, 1998). Assuming an average savings of 40% for 
  integrated building design, the cost of saved energy for residential and commercial 
  buildings has been calculated to be around US$3/GJ (the average cost of energy 
  in the US buildings sector is about US$14/GJ) (Nadel <i>et al</i>., 1998; US DOE/EIA, 
  1998).</p>
