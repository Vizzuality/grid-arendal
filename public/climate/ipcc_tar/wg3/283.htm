<h2>7.3 Analytical Structure and Critical Assumptions </h2>
<h3><a name="731"></a>7.3.1 System Boundaries: Project, Sector, Macroeconomic</h3>
<p>Assessing climate change mitigation involves a comparison between a policy 
  case and a non-policy case, otherwise referred to as a baseline case. The two 
  should, as far as possible, be defined in a way that the assessment can include 
  all major economic and social impacts of the policies, spillovers, and leakages, 
  as well as GHG emission implications. In other words, the cases should be assessed 
  in the context of a &#147;system boundary&#148; that include all major impacts. 
  The system boundary can be a specific project, include one or more sectors, 
  or the whole economy. </p>
<p>The project, sector, and macroeconomic levels can be defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Project</i>. A project level analysis considers a &#147;stand-alone&#148; 
    investment that is assumed not to have significant impacts on markets (both 
    demand and supply) beyond the activity itself. The activity can be the implementation 
    of specific technical facilities, infrastructure, demand-side regulations, 
    information efforts, technical standards, etc. Methodological frameworks to 
    assess the project level impacts include cost&#150;benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness 
    analysis, and lifecycle analysis. <br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Sector</i>. Sector level analysis considers sectoral policies in a &#147;partial-equilibrium&#148; 
    context, for which other sectors and the macroeconomic variables are assumed 
    to be as given. The policies can include economic instruments related to prices, 
    trade, and financing, specific large-scale investment projects, and demand-side 
    regulation efforts. Methodological frameworks for sectoral assessments include 
    various partial equilibrium models and technical simulation models for the 
    energy sector, agriculture, forestry, and the transportation sector.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Macroeconomic</i>. A macroeconomic analysis considers the impacts of 
    policies across all sectors and markets. The policies include all sorts of 
    economic policies, such as taxes, subsidies, monetary policies, specific investment 
    projects, and technology and innovation policies. Methodological frameworks 
    include various sorts of macroeconomic models such as general equilibrium 
    models, Keynesian models, and Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), among others.</li>
</ul>
<p>A &#147;trade-off&#148; is expected between the details in the assessment and 
  the complexity of the system considered. For example a project system boundary 
  allows a rather detailed assessment of GHG emissions and economic and social 
  impacts generated by a specific project or policy, but excludes sectoral and 
  economy-wide impacts. Conversely, an economy-wide system boundary, in principle, 
  allows all direct and indirect impacts to be included, but has little detail 
  on the impacts of implementing specific projects.</p>
<p>The system boundaries may be selected on the basis of the specific scope of 
  the study and the availability of analytical tools, such as models. Many studies 
  have been organized, in practice, on the basis of the scope and structure of 
  the modelling tools applied. For example, climate change mitigation studies 
  for the energy sector were frequently structured according to traditional modelling 
  approaches used in that sector, which are often rich in detail on technologies, 
  but do not include market behaviour. In contrast, macroeconomic models are often 
  rich in detail on market behaviour and price relationships, but do not explicitly 
  include major GHG emitting sources and related technologies. </p>
<p>Project assessment methodologies are generally very rich in detail and include 
  an assessment of various direct and indirect costs and benefits of the GHG reduction 
  policy considered. The assessments are often conducted as very data-intensive 
  exercises, in which various project assessment tools and expert judgements are 
  combined. They require rather strong technical skills of the experts in the 
  collection of data, to ensure consistency in the structure and results of the 
  analysis.</p>
<p>A combination of different modelling approaches is required for an effective 
  assessment of the options. For example, detailed project assessment has been 
  combined with a more general analysis of sectoral impacts, and macroeconomic 
  carbon tax studies have been combined with the sectoral modelling of larger 
  technology investment programmes.</p>
