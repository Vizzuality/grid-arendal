Clearly, the time path of emissions over a longer time period does affect the 
rate of change of concentrations and associated climate changes.<br>

<b><sup><a name="4"></a>4</sup></b> This 2 degree centigrade limit has also been 
adopted by the European Union as its provisional target for stabilizing greenhouse 
gas concentrations in the atmosphere under UNFCCC Article 2.<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><sup><a name="5"></a>5</sup></sup></b> When using the word &#147;emission 
reduction&#148;, reduction with respect to the baseline scenario is meant here. 
As a consequence, emissions in some countries can increase with respect to their 
1990 level or other baselines.<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="6"></a>6</sup></b> In the case of climate negotiations, possible 
coalitions are Annex B Parties of Kyoto Protocol, the Umbrella Group, UNFCCC Parties, 
etc.<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="7"></a>7</sup></b> Herein countries are symmetric when they share 
the same production technologies, consumers&#146; preferences, institutions, etc., 
namely when their payoff (welfare) functions are identical.<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="8"></a>8</sup></b> In the asymmetric case, the rule chosen to 
divide the gains from co-operation among the countries in the coalition (usually 
called burden-sharing rule) plays a crucial role because it affects the likelihood 
that each country decides to sign the agreement. The burden-sharing rule is usually 
taken from co-operative game theory and Nash's and Shapley's is the most used. 
In contrast, in the symmetric case different rules lead to the same outcome (equal 
shares). <br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="9"></a>9</sup></b> Surveys of the above literature are proposed 
in Barrett (1997b), Tulkens (1998), and Carraro (1999a). <br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="10"></a>10</sup></b> Unfortunately, game theory is far from achieving 
a well-defined non-co-operative theory of coalition formation under the above 
general assumptions and definitions. Several stability concepts can be used, but 
these unfortunately provide different equilibrium coalition structures. Among 
these are the concepts of equilibrium binding agreements (Ray and Vohra, 1997), 
a-stability and b-stability (Hart and Kurz, 1983), sequential stability (Bloch, 
1997), open-membership stability (Yi, 1997), and far-sighted stability (Chew, 
1994; Mariotti, 1997). <br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="11"></a>11</sup></b> See Chapters 7 and 8, and Goulder (1995), 
Bovenberg (1997), for surveys of this literature. <br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="12"></a>12</sup></b> For example, Shogren (1999) notes that &#147;it 
is estimated that any agreement without the cost flexibility provided by trading 
will at least double the USA costs, &#133; the key is to distribute emissions 
internationally so as to minimise the costs of climate policy&#148;. Manne and 
Richels (1999b) state that losses in 2010 are two and one-half times higher with 
the constraint on the purchase of carbon emission rights; international co-operation 
through trade is essential if we are to reduce mitigation costs (see also Glomstrod 
<i><i>et al</i></i>., 1992; Burniaux, 1998; Capros, 1998; Ellerman <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1998; Mensbrugghe, 
1998; Hourcade <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1999; Nordhaus, 1999; Rose and Stevens, 1999; Tol, 1999a, 
1999b).<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="13"></a>13</sup></b> This condition is less stringent when countries 
are asymmetric (see Botteon and Carraro, 1997a).<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="14"></a>14</sup></b> An extension to the case of structurally 
asymmetric countries is provided in Botteon and Carraro (1997b), whereas information 
asymmetries are accounted for in Katsoulacos (1997).<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="15"></a>15</sup></b> It is, however, important to keep in mind 
the negative impact that such linkages may have on the (perceived) fairness of 
the envisaged enlarged regime: there are possible linkages that could easily be 
perceived as "blackmail" on part of the Parties with strategic advantages.<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="16"></a>16</sup></b> For equity principles see Chapter 1, Section 
1.3.<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="17"></a>17</sup></b> See Carraro (1999b) and Grubb (1999) for 
a more detailed analysis.<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="18"></a>18</sup></b> This is why in Sections 10.2.2&#150;10.2.6 
the focus is on self-enforcing agreements. <br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="19"></a>19</sup></b> An overview of international technology 
transfer mechanisms is given in Radosevic (1999). <br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="20"></a>20</sup></b> From 1991 to 1998, GEF approved grants of 
in total US$610 million for 61 energy efficiency and renewable energy projects 
in 38 countries. An additional US$180 million in grants has been approved for 
climate change projects (IPCC, 2000a).<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="21"></a>21</sup></b> National Systems of Innovation also have 
a broader role in creating an enabling environment for the transfer of ESTs (see 
IPCC, 2000a).<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="22"></a>22</sup></b> In a &#147;spiky&#148; emissions trajectory 
the emissions follow the baseline before declining sharply in order to meet a 
concentration stabilization target, while in a &#147;smooth&#148; trajectory the 
emissions diverge from the baseline early, allowing a more gradual decline of 
emissions eventually.<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="23"></a>23</sup></b> Tulpul&eacute; (1998) defines the double-bubble 
as EU + EE; McKibbin, Ross, Shackleton and Wilcox (1999) defines it as European-OECD.<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="24"></a>24</sup></b> If less participants than the Annex 1 countries 
are assumed (e.g. without USA).<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="25"></a>25</sup></b> Special Case EU-Cap: purchases or sales 
of emissions by annex B countries may not exceed 5% of the weighted average of 
base year emissions and the assigned Kyoto emission budget.<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="26"></a>26</sup></b> If more participants than only the Annex 
1 countries are assumed (e.g. India, China).<br>
  <br>
<b><sup><a name="27"></a>27</sup></b> 2010 - 20 discounted at 5%.<br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="28"></a>28</sup></b> non-Annex 1 countries accept commitments 
consistent with the baseline emissions.<br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="29"></a>29</sup></b> Annex I - B10: 10% ceiling for buyers; this 
restricts imports of TP&#146;s.<br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="30"></a>30</sup></b> limit of permit sales by each A1-region 
to 15% of its total sales under unrestricted global trading.<br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="31"></a>31</sup></b> Quantified Emission Limitation or Reduction 
Commitments.<br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="32"></a>32</sup></b> EU targets are differentiated as agreed 
in June 1998.<br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="33"></a>33</sup></b> Annex I + China and India<br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="34"></a>34</sup></b> Maximum Emissions are 110% of allotment 
(= commitment); <i>i.e</i>. restricts the quantitiy bought from abrought<br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="35"></a>35</sup></b> Annex 1 plus Asia<br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="36"></a>36</sup></b> 90% of allotment must be emitted =&gt; this 
restricts the quantity sold to others<br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="37"></a>37</sup></b> No Hot Air: Trading in Hot-Air is not allowed, 
indicating that any effectuated trading in GHG emissions must represent real emission 
reductions<br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="38"></a>38</sup></b> EU-Caps<br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="39"></a>39</sup></b> 50% reduction from BAU scenario: The Maximum 
allowed acquisition from all three flexibility mechanisms are limited to 50% of 
the difference between the projected baseline emissions and the Kyoto targets 
in 2010<br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="40"></a>40</sup></b> The terms &#147;justice&#148; and &#147;fairness&#148; 
are often used as synonyms, however, there are debates on the different notions 
of the terms. Following Albin (1995), justice means distributive justice, in the 
sense of a general standard for allocating collective benefits and burdens among 
the members of a community at local, national, or global levels. Principles of 
justice exist prior to and independently of any phenomenon to be judged. Fairness 
consists of individual perceptions of what is reasonable under the circumstances, 
often in reference to how a principle of justice regarded as pertinent should 
be applied. <br>
<br>
<b><sup><a name="41"></a>41</sup></b> The comparison and aggregation of welfare 
in terms of monetary units such as GDP across different countries is a controversial 
issue. Attempts have been made to incorporate equity considerations through weighting 
the welfare changes, giving attention to the unequal distribution of wealth among 
developed and developing countries (Tol <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1999).<br>
