<h4>10.4.2.2 Precautionary Considerations </h4>
<p>In decision making, the precautionary principle is considered when possibly 
  dangerous, irreversible, or catastrophic effects are identified, but scientific 
  evaluation of the potential damage is not sufficiently certain, and actions 
  to prevent these potential adverse effects need to be justified (Jonas, 1985; 
  O&#146;Riordan and Cameron, 1994; CEC, 2000). The precautionary principle implies 
  an emphasis on the need to prevent such adverse effects. It thus acknowledges 
  societal risk preferences, which are, plausibly, that humankind would rather 
  be risk averse than risk neutral or risk seeking if one considers, for instance, 
  future climate-induced loss of GNP (Pearce, 1994; Jaeger <i>et al</i>., 1998). Hence, 
  attitudes towards risk play a key role in decision making under uncertainty. 
  However, one might also favour prevention to cure even where one is certain 
  about the damage.</p>
<p>With the precautionary principle, uncertainty about the damage to be incurred 
  does not serve as an argument to delay action. In the face of great uncertainty, 
  a precautionary approach might even result in a more stringent emission-reductions 
  target and/or adaptational response (Cantor and Yohe, 1998).</p>
<p>The evaluation of uncertainty and the necessary precaution is plagued with 
  complex pitfalls. These include the global scale, long time lags between forcing 
  and response, the impossibility to test experimentally before the facts arise, 
  and the low frequency variability with the periods involved being longer than 
  the length of most records (Moss and Schneider, 2000). Some of these uncertainty 
  aspects may be irreducible in principle, and hence decision makers will have 
  to continue to take action under significant uncertainty, so the problem of 
  climate change evolves as a subject of risk management in which strategies are 
  formulated as new knowledge arises (Jaeger <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>Aspects of uncertainty are associated with each link of the causal chain of 
  climate change, beginning with GHG emissions, covering damage caused by climate 
  change, followed by a set of mitigation and adaptation measures (Jepma and Munasinghe, 
  1998). In particular, damage-function estimates are prone to low confidence 
  as they involve uncertainty in both natural and socioeconomic systems. To quantify 
  the impact of climate change on flora and fauna needs consideration of many 
  effects because of the complexity of the biological and ecological systems. 
  Similarly, the manner in which humans adapt to climate change is not well known, 
  socioeconomic modules are still at a stage of low disaggregation, and damage 
  as a function of vulnerability, adaptation and time-dependency is poorly understood 
  (Tol <i>et al</i>., 1998; Tol, 1999a, 1999b).</p>
<p>However, following the precautionary principle, uncertainty is not an argument 
  for delaying action, as the UNFCCC acknowledges in Article 3.3: parties should 
  &#147;take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes 
  of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are threats 
  of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should 
  not be used as a reason for postponing such measures...&#148; (UNFCCC, 1993). 
  Pursuing this principle, mitigation and adaptation measures are to be implemented 
  before full information is available and uncertainties regarding the scope and 
  timing of climate change are resolved. Yet, the question of timing and extent 
  of mitigation and/or adaptation policies remains unquantified by the precautionary 
  principle (Portney, 1998).</p>
