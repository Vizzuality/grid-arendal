<h1>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>
<p>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has as its 
  ultimate goal the &#147;stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the 
  atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference 
  with the climate system.&#148; Whereas mitigation costs play only a secondary 
  role in establishing the target, they play a more important role in determining 
  how the target is to be achieved. UNFCCC states that &#147;policies and measures 
  to deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure global 
  benefits at the lowest possible costs.&#148; This chapter examines the literature 
  on the costs of greenhouse gas mitigation policies at the national, regional, 
  and global levels. The net welfare gains or losses are reported, including (when 
  available) the ancillary benefits of mitigation policies. These studies employ 
  the full range of analytical tools described in <a href="266.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>, from the technologically rich bottom-up models to more aggregate top-down 
  models, which link the energy sector to the rest of the economy. </p>
<p>Models can also be distinguished through their level of geographical disaggregation. 
  Global models, which divide the world into a limited number of regions, can 
  provide important insights with regard to international emissions trade, capital 
  flows, trade patterns, and the implications of alternative international regimes 
  regarding contributions to mitigation by various regions of the globe. National 
  models are more appropriate for examining the effectiveness of alternative fiscal 
  policies in offsetting mitigation costs, the short-term effects of macro shocks 
  on employment and inflation, and the implications of domestic burden-sharing 
  rules for various sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>To cope with their wide range of diversity, the studies are grouped into three 
  categories. The first two focus on the near-to-medium term. In one of these, 
  the focus is exclusively on domestic policies. In the other, the domestic/international 
  interface is explored. The third category focuses on the long-term goals of 
  climate policy and explores cost-effective implementation strategies. That is, 
  what is the least-cost emission reduction pathway for accomplishing a prescribed 
  goal? The major conclusions are summarized below. </p>
<p>For any class of models, the emissions baseline is critically important in 
  determining mitigation costs. It defines the size of the reduction required 
  for meeting a particular target. The growth rate in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) 
  emissions is determined by:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>growth rate in gross domestic product (GDP);<br>
  </li>
  <li>decline rate of energy use per unit of output, which depends on structural 
    change in the economy and on technological development; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>decline rate of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of energy use.<br>
    Much of the difference in cost projections can be explained by differences 
    in these key variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Economic studies vary widely in their estimate of mitigation costs (both across 
  and within countries). These differences can be traced to assumptions about 
  economic growth, the cost and availability of existing and new technologies 
  (both on the supply and demand side of the energy sector), resource endowments, 
  the extent of &#147;no regrets&#148; options and the choice of policy instruments.</p>
<p>Virtually all analysts agree on the existence of &#147;no regrets&#148; options. 
  Such options are typically assumed to be included in the reference (no policy) 
  scenario by economic modellers. Even so, the overwhelming majority of emission 
  baselines show that emissions continue to rise well into the future. This suggests 
  that zero cost options are insufficient to reduce emissions in the absence of 
  policy intervention.</p>
<p>Mitigation costs to meet a prescribed target will be lower if the tax revenues 
  (or revenues from auctioned permits) are used to reduce existing distortionary 
  taxes (the so-called &#147;double dividend&#148;). The preferred policy depends 
  on the existing tax structure. Most European studies find that cutting payroll 
  taxes is more efficient than other types of recycling. A significant number 
  of these studies conclude that, within some range of abatement targets, the 
  net costs of mitigation policies can be close to zero and even slightly negative. 
  Conversely, in the USA, studies suggest that reducing taxes on capital is more 
  efficient, but few models report negative costs. </p>
<p>Policies aimed at mitigating greenhouse gases can have positive and negative 
  side effects (or ancillary benefits and costs, not taking into account benefits 
  of avoided climate change) on society. Although this report overall emphasizes 
  co-benefits of climate policies with other policies (to reflect the reality 
  in many regions that measures are taken with multiple objectives rather than 
  climate mitigation alone), the literature that focuses on climate mitigation 
  uses the term &#147;ancillary benefits&#148; of specific climate mitigation 
  measures. In spite of recent progress in methods development, it remains very 
  challenging to develop quantitative estimates of the ancillary effects, benefits 
  and costs of GHG mitigation policies. Despite these difficulties, in the short 
  term, ancillary benefits of GHG policies under some circumstances can be a significant 
  fraction of private (direct) mitigation costs. In some cases the magnitude of 
  ancillary benefits of mitigation may be comparable to the costs of the mitigating 
  measures, adding to the no regrets potential. The exact magnitude, scale and 
  scope of these ancillary benefits and costs will vary with local geographical 
  and baseline conditions. In some circumstances, where baseline conditions involve 
  relatively low carbon emissions and population density, benefits may be low. 
  For the studies reviewed here, the biggest share of the ancillary benefits is 
  related to public health. </p>
<p>Mitigation costs are highly dependent on assumptions about trade in emission 
  permits. Cost estimates are lowest when there would be full global trading. 
  That is, when reductions are made where it is least expensive to do so regardless 
  of their geographical location. Costs increase as the size of the emissions 
  market contracts. In the case of Annex B trading only, the availability of excess 
  assigned amount units in Russia and Ukraine can be critical in lowering the 
  overall mitigation costs. Carbon trade provides some means for hedging against 
  uncertainties regarding emissions&#146; baselines and abatement costs. It also 
  reduces the consequences of an inequitable allocation of assigned amounts.</p>
<p>It has long been recognized that international trade in emission quota can 
  reduce mitigation costs. This will occur when countries with high domestic marginal 
  abatement costs purchase emission quotas from countries with low marginal abatement 
  costs. This is often referred to as &#147;where flexibility&#148;. That is, 
  allowing reductions to take place where it is cheapest to do so regardless of 
  geographical location. It is important to note that where the reductions take 
  place is independent upon who pays for the reductions. The chapter discusses 
  the cost reductions from emission trading for Annex B and full global trading 
  compared to a no-trading case. All of the models show significant gains as the 
  size of the trading market is expanded. The difference among models is due in 
  part to differences in their baseline, the cost and availability of low-cost 
  substitutes on both the supply and demand sides of the energy sector, and the 
  treatment of short-term macro shocks. In general, all calculated gross costs 
  for the non-trading case are below 2% of GDP (which is assumed to have increased 
  significantly in the period considered) and in most cases below 1%. Annex-B 
  trading would generally decrease these costs to well below 1 % of GDP for OECD 
  regions. The extent to which domestic policies relying on revenue recycling 
  instruments can lower these figures is conditional upon the articulation of 
  these policies and the design of trading systems.</p>
<p>Emissions constraints in Annex I countries are likely to have so-called &#147;spillover&#148; 
  effects on non Annex B countries. For example, Annex I emissions reductions 
  result in lower oil demand, which in turn leads to a decline in the international 
  price of oil. As a response, non-Annex I countries may increase their oil imports 
  and emit more than they would otherwise. Oil-importing non-Annex I countries 
  may benefit, whereas oil exporters may experience a decline in revenue. </p>
<p>A second example of spillover effects involves the location of carbon-intensive 
  industries. A constraint on Annex I emissions reduces their competitiveness 
  in the international marketplace. Recent studies suggest that there will be 
  some industrial relocation abroad, with non-Annex I countries benefitting at 
  the expense of Annex I countries. However, non-Annex I countries may be adversely 
  affected by the decline in exports likely to accompany a decrease in economic 
  activity in Annex I countries. </p>
<p>The cost estimates of stabilizing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  depend upon the concentration stabilization target, the emissions pathway to 
  stabilization and the baseline scenario assumed. Unfortunately, the target is 
  likely to remain the subject of intense scientific and political debate for 
  some time. What is needed is a decision-making approach that explicitly incorporates 
  this type of uncertainty and its sequential resolution over time. The desirable 
  amount of hedging in the near term depends upon one&#146;s assessment of the 
  stakes, the odds, and the costs of policy intervention. The risk premium&#150;the 
  amount that society is willing to pay to reduce risk&#150;is ultimately a political 
  decision that differs among countries.</p>
<p>The concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is determined more by 
  cumulative rather than year-by-year emissions. A number of studies suggest that 
  the choice of emissions pathway can be as important as the target itself in 
  determining overall mitigation costs. A gradual near-term transition from the 
  world&#146;s present energy system minimizes premature retirement of existing 
  capital stock, provides time for technology development, and avoids premature 
  lock-in to early versions of rapidly developing low-emission technology. On 
  the other hand, more aggressive near-term action would decrease <br>
  environmental risks associated with rapid climatic changes, stimulate more rapid 
  deployment of existing low-emission technologies, provide strong near-term incentives 
  to future technological changes that may help to avoid lock-in to carbon intensive 
  technologies, and allow for later tightening of targets should that be deemed 
  desirable in light of evolving scientific understanding.<br>
