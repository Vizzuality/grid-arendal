<h3>7.3.4 Assumptions about Technology Options </h3>
<h4><a name="7341"></a>7.3.4.1 Technological Uncertainty</h4>
<p>Costing climate change policy is an uncertain business. This uncertainty often 
  manifests itself in the choice of technologies to mitigate and adapt to risks 
  from climate change. Firms and nations can attempt to reduce risk by using more 
  of the low-carbon technologies presently on the shelf or they can invent new 
  ones. How quickly people will switch within the set of existing technologies 
  with or without a change in relative energy prices is open to debate; how creative 
  people are at inventing new technologies given relative prices is also a matter 
  of discussion. </p>
<p>The key to addressing uncertainty is to capture a range of reasonable behaviours 
  that underpins the choice to adopt existing or develop new low-carbon technology. 
  Two key questions that should be addressed are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>What explains the rate of adoption of existing low-carbon technologies given 
    the relative price of energy?<br>
  </li>
  <li>What explains the rate of invention of new low-carbon technologies given 
    relative prices?</li>
</ul>
<p>Which answers to these questions are accepted determines whether some weighted 
  average of the estimates or a lower or upper estimate is used to guide policy. 
  <br>
  <br>
  For any given target and set of policy provisions, costs decline when consumers 
  and firms have more plentiful low-cost substitutes for high-carbon technologies. 
  Engineering studies suggest 20%-25% of existing carbon emissions could be eliminated 
  (depending on how the electricity is generated) at low cost if people switched 
  to new technologies, such as compact fluorescent light bulbs, improved thermal 
  insulation, heating and cooling systems, and energy-efficient appliances. The 
  critical issue is how this adoption of efficient technologies occurs in practice 
  and which sort of regulation and economic instruments could eventually support 
  this adoption. <a href="179.htm">Chapter 5</a> of this report assesses the literature 
  regarding technology adoption and regulation frameworks.</p>
<p>Many economists have emphasized that technological progress is driven by relative 
  prices, and that people do not switch to new technologies unless prices induce 
  them to switch. New efficient technologies, according to this argument, then 
  are not taken up without a proper price signal. People are also perceived to 
  behave as if their time horizons are short, perhaps reflecting their uncertainty 
  about future energy prices and the reliability of the technology. Also, factors 
  other than energy efficiency matter to consumers, such as a new technology&#146;s 
  quality and features, and the time and effort required to learn about it and 
  how it works. This issue has already been flagged in relation to technology 
  adoption and implementation costs, but it also has an uncertainty element to 
  it.</p>
<p>The different viewpoints on the origin of technological change appear in the 
  assumed rate at which the energy-consuming capital can turnover without a change 
  in relative energy prices. Modellers account for the penetration of technological 
  change over time through a technical coefficient called the &#147;autonomous 
  energy efficiency improvement&#148; (AEEI). The AEEI reflects the rate of change 
  in energy intensity (the energy-to-GDP ratio) holding energy prices constant 
  (see IPCC, 1996a, Chapter 8). The presumed autonomous technological improvement 
  in the energy intensity of an economy can lead to significant differences in 
  the estimated costs of mitigation. As such, many observers view the choice of 
  AEEI as crucial in setting the baseline scenario against which to judge the 
  costs of mitigation. The costs of mitigation are inversely related the AEEI&#150; 
  the greater the AEEI the lower the costs to reach any given climate target. 
  The costs decrease because people adopt low-carbon technology of their own accord, 
  with no change in relative prices. </p>
<p>Modellers have traditionally based the AEEI on historical rates of change, 
  but now some are using higher values based on data from bottoms-up models and 
  arguments about &#147;announcement effects&#148;. For instance, some analysts 
  have optimistically argued that the existence of the Kyoto Protocol will accelerate 
  the implementation of energy efficient production methods to 2% per year or 
  more. Policymakers and modellers continue to debate the validity of this assumption 
  (see, e.g., Kram, 1998; Weyant, 1998). A range of AEEIs has been adopted in 
  the modelling literature (see <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> for more details). 
  The AEEI has ranged from 0.4% to 1.5% per year for all of the regions of the 
  world, and has generated large differences in long-term project baselines (e.g., 
  Manne and Richels, 1992). Edmonds and Barns&#146; (1990) sensitivity study confirms 
  the importance of the AEEI in affecting cost estimates. However, as noted by 
  Dean and Hoeller (1992): &#147;unfortunately there is relatively little backing 
  in the economic literature for specific values of the AEEI ... the inability 
  to tie it down to a much narrower range ... is a severe handicap, an uncertainty 
  which needs to be recognized.&#148;</p>
