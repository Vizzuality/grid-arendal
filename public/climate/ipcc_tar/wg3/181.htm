<h2>5.1 Introduction </h2>
<p>Technology transfer comprises a broad set of processes covering the flows of 
  know-how, experience, and equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change 
  among different stakeholders such as governments, private sector entities, financial 
  institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and research and/or education 
  institutions (IPCC, 1996; IPCC, 2000b). The term transfer encompasses diffusion 
  of technologies and technology co-operation across and within countries. It 
  comprises the process of learning to understand, utilize, and replicate the 
  technology, including the capacity to choose and adapt it to local conditions, 
  and integrate it with indigenous technologies. </p>
<p>The previous chapters (<a href="089.htm">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="155.htm">4</a>) 
  have discussed the characteristics of different technologies and practices, 
  and their potential and costs for the mitigation of climate change. <a href="089.htm">Chapter 
  3</a> has identified numerous negative cost or &#147;no regrets&#148; options 
  whose full implementation is prevented by various types of barriers. The focus 
  of this chapter, thus, is on the various barriers that inhibit the process of 
  technology transfer, but not on technology programmes, which are covered in 
  <a href="089.htm">Chapter 3</a>. A &#147;barrier&#148; is any obstacle to reaching 
  a potential that can be overcome by a policy, programme, or measure (<a href="180.htm#fig51">Figure 
  5.1</a>). This chapter describes the barriers that lie below the &#147;socioeconomic 
  potential&#148; line in <a href="180.htm#fig51">Figure 5.1</a>. Barriers to 
  technology transfer may also be viewed as opportunities for intervention by 
  the aforementioned stakeholders so that technologies can reach their full potential. 
  An &#147;opportunity&#148; is thus any situation or circumstance to decrease 
  the gap between the &#147;market potential&#148; of a technology and the economic, 
  socioeconomic, or technical potential. Barriers and opportunities tend to be 
  context-specific, and can change over time and vary across countries. Policies, 
  programmes, and measures may be used to take advantage of the opportunities 
  to help overcome the barriers. The interventions are largely described and assessed 
  in <a href="224.htm">Chapter 6</a>, although some types of interventions at 
  the sectoral level are illustrated in <a href="205.htm">Section 5.4</a> of this 
  chapter.</p>
<p>Opportunities for climate change mitigation exist both in reducing the intensity 
  of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the level of activities that cause these 
  emissions. Reducing the level of an activity, for instance vehicle travel, need 
  not reduce the services associated with it if a substitute like telecommuting 
  can satisfy the same need. GHG mitigation can thus be achieved without sacrificing 
  consumer welfare. Opportunities for such changes are equally important and need 
  to be actively sought out. The interventions needed for achieving changes in 
  the level of activity, however, can encompass the broad array of macro and micro 
  policies that affect consumers and producers alike. In this chapter, the barriers, 
  opportunities, and sectoral interventions for both the GHG intensity and &#147;activity&#148; 
  changes are discussed. The broader macro-interventions are discussed in <a href="224.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>.</p>
<p>An element that lies largely unexplored is the connection between poverty and 
  climate change mitigation. A large proportion of the world&#146;s population 
  lives in poverty, often outside a cash economy, and does not have access to 
  modern fuels. Even when the poor are part of a cash economy, they are often 
  deprived of access to financial instruments that require collateral. The literature 
  on barriers and opportunities to address their need for fuels, and the consequent 
  GHG emissions, is relatively sparse. In this chapter, the limited material on 
  barriers, opportunities, and interventions associated with the provision of 
  energy services to the poor is reviewed primarily in the sections on finance 
  (<a href="190.htm">Section 5.3.3</a>), energy use in buildings (<a href="206.htm">Section 
  5.4.1</a>) and agriculture (<a href="215.htm">Section 5.4.5</a>).</p>
<p>Barriers to technology transfer have been described and classified in many 
  different ways. Reddy (1991) classifies barriers by actors, consumers, energy 
  providers, etc.; and others (Hirst and Brown, 1990; Evans, 1991; Hirst, 1992) 
  by the type of barrier, financing, pricing, etc. Technological and social changes 
  offer new opportunities for the diffusion of GHG-mitigative technologies. Rapidly 
  changing economies and institutional and social structures offer opportunities 
  for locking into GHG-mitigative technologies that are likely to grow over the 
  long term. Exploiting opportunities during a period of rapid change is typically 
  easier than in a static environment. For example, the Internet revolution means 
  that many aspects of society and the economy are being reshaped, offering opportunities 
  to build environmental and sustainable development practices into the emerging 
  paradigms. At the more micro-level, the beginning of an investment cycle for 
  power supply systems and house purchase by individuals and families is a period 
  when they are making major purchase decisions. Governments can influence these 
  decisions through various regulations, financial incentives and information 
  at such times to make the new investment less-GHG intensive. Synergies exist 
  between GHG mitigation and other policy goals, e.g., reducing transport air 
  pollution or conserving soils. Measures to address the latter offer opportunities 
  for GHG mitigation also. While the chapter focuses broadly on both barriers 
  and opportunities, <a href="186.htm">Sections 5.3.1</a> and <a href="198.htm">5.3.8</a> 
  specifically review the models of, and experience with, technological and social 
  innovation and the opportunities offered for the diffusion of GHG-mitigative 
  technologies. Synergies too are noted throughout, but particularly so in the 
  sectoral <a href="213.htm">sections 5.4.4</a> through <a href="217.htm">5.4.7</a>.<br>
  <br>
  The chapter focuses not only on the energy demand and supply sectors, which 
  have a rich literature in this field, but also on the agriculture, forestry, 
  and waste sectors. In the introductory sections below, a conceptual framework 
  for understanding the role of opportunities and barriers, and a review of the 
  two earlier Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that have 
  dealt with this topic, namely the Second Assessment Report (SAR) and the Special 
  Report on Technology Transfer (SRTT) are presented. <a href="185.htm">Section 
  5.3</a> then discusses the generic opportunities and barriers that apply across 
  all sectors, which is followed by a discussion of the prominent barriers and 
  opportunities in appropriate sectors of the economy. </p>
