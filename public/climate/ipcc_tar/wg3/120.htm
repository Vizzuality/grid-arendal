<h2>3.7 Waste</h2>
<a name="371"></a> 
<h3>3.7.1 Summary of the Second Assessment Report</h3>
<p>The major emphasis in the SAR was on the reduction of greenhouse gases associated 
  with industrial recycling in the metals, glass and paper industries. These topics 
  are addressed in the industrial <a href="107.htm#35">Section 3.5</a> of this 
  chapter. There was a less systematic account of the methane emissions from landfills, 
  or of the consumer dimension of recycling, both of which will be emphasized 
  here.</p>
<a name="372"></a> 
<h3>3.7.2 Historic and Future Trends</h3>
<p>Waste and waste management affect the release of greenhouse gases in five major 
  ways: (1) landfill emissions of methane; (2) reductions in fossil fuel use by 
  substituting energy recovery from waste combustion; (3) reduction in energy 
  consumption and process gas releases in extractive and manufacturing industries, 
  as a result of recycling; (4) carbon sequestration in forests, caused by decreased 
  demand for virgin paper; and (5) energy used in the transport of waste for disposal 
  or recycling. Except for the long-range transport of glass for reuse or recycling, 
  transport emissions of secondary materials are often one or two orders of magnitude 
  smaller than the other four factors (Ackerman, 2000).</p>
<a name="3721"></a> 
<h4>3.7.2.1 Landfills</h4>
<p>Worldwide, the dominant methods of waste disposal are landfills and open dumps. 
  Although these disposal methods often have lower first costs, they may contribute 
  to serious local air and water pollution, and release high GWP landfill gas 
  (LFG). LFG is generated when organic material decomposes anaerobically. It comprises 
  approximately 50%-60% methane, 40%-45% CO<sub>2</sub> and the traces of non-methane 
  volatile organics and halogenated organics. In 1995, US, landfill methane emissions 
  of 64 MtC<sub>eq</sub> slightly exceed its agricultural sector methane from 
  livestock and manure.</p>
<p>Methane emission from landfills varies considerably depending on the waste 
  characteristics (composition, density, particle size), moisture content, nutrients, 
  microbes, temperature, and pH (El-Fadel, 1998). Data from field studies conducted 
  worldwide indicate that landfill methane production may range over six orders 
  of magnitude (between 0.003-3000g/m<sup>2</sup>/day) (Bogner <i>et al</i>., 1995). 
  Not all landfill methane is emitted into the air; some is stored in the landfill 
  and part is oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub>. The IPCC theoretical approach for methane 
  estimation has been complemented with more recent, site-specific models that 
  take into account local conditions such as soil type, climate, and methane oxidation 
  rates to calculate overall methane emissions (Bogner <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>Laboratory experiments suggest that a fraction of the carbon in landfilled 
  organic waste may be sequestered indefinitely in landfills depending upon local 
  conditions. However, there are no plausible scenarios in which landfilling minimizes 
  GHG emissions from waste management. For yard waste, GHG emissions are roughly 
  comparable from landfilling and composting; for food waste, composting yields 
  significantly lower emissions than landfilling. For paper waste, landfilling 
  causes higher GHG emissions than either recycling or incineration with energy 
  recovery (US EPA, 2000).</p>
<a name="3722"></a> 
<h4>3.7.2.2 Recycling and Reuse</h4>
<p>Recycling involves the collection of materials during production or at the 
  end of a product&#146;s useful lifetime for reuse in the manufacturing process. 
  The degree of treatment varies from simple remelting of glass, aluminium, or 
  steel, to the breaking apart and reconstitution of paper or other fibres (e.g., 
  textiles or carpets), to depolymerization of plastics and synthetic fibres to 
  monomers, which are then used instead of petrochemicals to synthesize new polymers. 
</p>
<p>In many cases, manufacturing products from recycled materials is less energy 
  intensive and associated with fewer GHG emissions than making products from 
  virgin materials. This is especially true for aluminium and steel, which are 
  energy intensive and release significant process GHGs during production (CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and PFCs). A US EPA analysis finds lower GHG emissions over the product life 
  cycle from recycling than from virgin production and disposal of paper, metals, 
  glass, and plastics under typical American conditions (US EPA, 2000).</p>
<p>Overall energy consumption is lower for recycled paper than for virgin paper, 
  yet there is some debate over life cycle GHG emissions between paper recycling 
  (Blum <i>et al</i>., 1997; Finnveden and Thomas, 1998; US EPA, 1998) and paper consumption 
  with energy recovery (Bystroem and Loennstedt, 1997; Ruth and Harrington, 1998; 
  IIED, 1996). These conflicting analyses make different underlying assumptions 
  concerning the fuel displaced by energy released from paper incineration, the 
  energy source for the electricity used in paper production, how the recycled 
  paper is utilized, and how much carbon sequestration can be credited to uncut 
  forests because of recycling. In all studies, landfilling of paper clearly releases 
  more GHGs than either recycling or incineration.</p>
<p>The life cycle environmental impact and GHG emissions from recycling are usually 
  higher than reusing products. This may not hold true if the used materials have 
  to be transported over long distances. To address this issue, some countries 
  such as Germany, Norway, Denmark, and other European countries have standardized 
  bottles for local reuse. </p>

<h4>3.7.2.3 Composting and Digestion</h4>
<p>Composting refers to the aerobic digestion of organic waste. The decomposed 
  residue, if free from contaminants, can be used as a soil conditioner. As noted 
  above under landfilling, GHG emissions from composting are comparable to landfilling 
  for yard waste, and lower than landfilling for food waste. These estimates do 
  not include the benefits of the reduced need for synthetic fertilizer, which 
  is associated with large CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during manufacture and transport, 
  and N<sub>2</sub>O releases during use. USDA research indicates that compost 
  usage can reduce fertilizer requirements by at least 20% (Ligon, 1999), thereby 
  significantly reducing net GHG emissions (see <a href="115.htm#36">Section 3.6</a>).</p>
<p>Composting of yard waste has become widespread in many developed countries, 
  and some communities compost food waste as well. Small, low-technology facilities 
  handling only yard waste are inexpensive and generally problem-free. Some European 
  and North American cities have encountered difficulties implementing large-scale, 
  mixed domestic, commercial and industrial bio-waste collection and composting 
  schemes. The problems range from odour complaints to heavy metal contamination 
  of the decomposed residue. Also, large-scale composting requires mechanical 
  aeration which can be energy intensive (40-70 kW/t of waste) (Faaij <i>et al</i>., 
  1998). However, facilities that combine anaerobic and aerobic digestion are 
  able to provide this energy from self-supplied methane. If 25% or more of the 
  waste is digested anaerobically the system can be self-sufficient (Edelmann 
  and Schleiss, 1999). </p>
<p>For developing countries, the low cost and simplicity of composting, and the 
  high organic content of the waste stream make small-scale composting a promising 
  solution. Increased composting of municipal waste can reduce waste management 
  costs and emissions, while creating employment and other public health benefits.</p>
<p>Anaerobic digestion to produce methane for fuel has been successful on a variety 
  of scales in developed and developing countries. The rural biogas programmes 
  based upon manure and agricultural waste in India and China are very extensive. 
  In industrial countries, digestion at large facilities utilizes raw materials 
  including organic waste from agriculture, sewage sludge, kitchens, slaughterhouses, 
  and food processing industries. </p>
<p><a name="3724"></a> </p>
<h4>3.7.2.4 Incineration </h4>
<p>Incineration is common in the industrialized regions of Europe, Japan and the 
  northeastern USA where space limitations, high land costs, and political opposition 
  to locating landfills in communities limit land disposal. In developing countries, 
  low land and labour costs, the lack of high heat value materials such as paper 
  and plastic in the waste stream, and the high capital cost of incinerators have 
  discouraged waste combustion as an option. </p>
<p>Waste-to-energy (WTE) plants create heat and electricity from burning mixed 
  solid waste. Because of high corrosion in the boilers, the steam temperature 
  in WTE plants is less than 400 degrees Celsius. As a result, total system efficiency 
  of WTE plants is only between 12%&#150;24% (Faaij <i>et al</i>., 1998; US EPA, 1998; 
  Swithenbank and Nasserzadeh, 1997). </p>
<p>Net GHG emissions from WTE facilities are usually low and comparable to those 
  from biomass energy systems, because electricity and heat are generated largely 
  from photosynthetically produced paper, yard waste, and organic garbage rather 
  than from fossil fuels. Only the combustion of fossil fuel based waste such 
  as plastics and synthetic fabrics contribute to net GHG releases, but recycling 
  of these materials generally produces even lower emissions.</p>
<a name="3725"></a> 
<h4>3.7.2.5 Waste Water</h4>
<p>Methane emissions from domestic and industrial wastewater disposal contribute 
  about 10% of global anthropogenic methane sources (30-40Mt annually). Industrial 
  wastewater, mainly from pulp and paper and food processing industries, contributes 
  more than 90% of these emissions, whereas domestic and commercial wastewater 
  disposal contributes about 2 Mt annually. Unlike methane emissions from solid 
  waste, most of the methane from wastewater is believed to be generated in non-Annex 
  I countries, where wastewater is often untreated and stored under anaerobic 
  conditions (SAR).</p>
