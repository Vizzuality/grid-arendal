<h4>8.4.5.2 Learning by Doing (LBD)</h4>
<p>LBD as a source of technical change was first emphasized by Arrow (1962). Nakicenovic 
  (1996) discussed the importance of LBD in energy technology, and Messner (1995) 
  endogenizes the learning process in energy models. LBD is a happy consequence 
  of those investments in which learning is a result of cumulative experience 
  with new technologies. LBD typically refers to reductions in production cost, 
  in which learning takes place on the shop floor through day-to-day operations, 
  not in the R&amp;D laboratory. The LBD component of change is significant too. 
  Kline and Rosenberg (1986) discuss industry studies that indicate that LBD-type 
  improvements to processes in some cases contribute more to technological progress 
  than the initial process development itself.</p>
<p>LBD models use the installed capacity or cumulative use as an indicator of 
  accumulating knowledge in each sector. The abatement costs are represented by 
  the specific investment costs in US$/kWh. The models are global and therefore 
  the diffusion process is not represented. The optimization problems are non-convex, 
  which raises a difficult computational problem to find an optimum. However, 
  pioneering work at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis 
  (IIASA) on the MESSAGE model and additional developments based on models like 
  MARKAL and ERIS; (MATSSON), Kypreos and Barreto (1999), Seebregts <i>et al.</i> 
  (1999a), (SKFB), Tseng <i>et al.</i> (1999), and Kypreos <i>et al.</i> (2000) 
  demonstrate progress in this direction. They show that several technologies 
  are likely to play a prominent role in reducing the cost of abatement, if ITC 
  is indeed taken into account when computing the equilibrium. A problem with 
  modelling endogenous technological change is that the traditional baseline scenario 
  versus optimal policy run argumentation is not feasible. This follows directly 
  from the path dependence. The most important results are: greater consistency 
  of model results with the observed developments of technological change;<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>new technologies first appear in niche markets with rising market shares;<br>
  </li>
  <li>the time of breakthrough of new technologies can be influenced by policy 
    measures (taxes and R&amp;D) if they are strong enough;<br>
  </li>
  <li>identification of key technologies, like photovoltaic modules or fuel cells, 
    for public R&amp;D investments is difficult; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>technological lock-in effects depend on costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important conclusion for the timing of a mitigation policy is that 
  early emissions-reduction measures are preferable when LBD is considered. This 
  is confirmed unambiguously by a macroeconomic modelling study (van der Zwaan 
  <i>et al., </i>1999/2000) which finds also lower levels of carbon taxes than 
  those usually advocated.</p>
<p>These findings must be tempered by the fact that the models are not only highly 
  non-linear systems, and therefore potentially sensitive to input assumptions, 
  but also the quantitative values employed by modellers are typically drawn from 
  successful historical examples. Furthermore, the empirical foundations of LBD 
  are drawn from observations of the relationship between cumulative deployment 
  and/or investment in new technology and cost. This relationship is equally consistent 
  with the hypothesis that a third factor reduced costs, in turn leading to increases 
  in demand. The authors restrict their findings to more qualitative assertions, 
  because of the limitations of current models (Messner, 1997; Gr&uuml;bler and 
  Messner, 1998; Barreto and Kypreos, 1999; Seebregts <i>et al.,</i> 1999a, 1999b). 
  The research so far has been limited to energy system models and ignored other 
  forms of endogenous, complex changes that are important for emissions, like 
  changes in lifestyles and social institutions.</p>
<h4><a name="8453"></a>8.4.5.3 The Distinction Between Action and Abatement</h4>
<p>The key message from this discussion about technical change is that a clear 
  distinction has to be made between the timing of action and the timing of abatement. 
  As a result of inertia in technological innovation, short-term action is required 
  to abate more in the future, but a given amount of abatement at a given point 
  in time is not a good measure of the effort. The necessity of this distinction 
  is reinforced by the consideration of inertia in capital stocks. Mitigation 
  costs are influenced by assumptions about the lifespan of existing plants and 
  equipment (e.g., power plants, housing, and transport). Energy-related capital 
  stock is typically long lived and premature retirement is apt to be costly. 
  For example, an effort to change the transportation infrastructure will not 
  reduce carbon emissions significantly for two decades or more. Hence, a drastic 
  departure from the current trend is impossible without high social costs and 
  a delay of action in this sector will require higher abatement costs in the 
  more flexible sectors to meet a given target. Lecocq <i>et al. </i>(1999) found 
  that these costs would be increased by 18% in 2020 for a 550ppmv target and 
  by 150% for a 450ppmv target.</p>
<p>This irreversibility built into technological change is far more critical when 
  the uncertainty about the ultimate target is considered. In this case indeed, 
  many of the parameters that legitimize the postponing of abatement play in the 
  opposite direction. If indeed the concentration constraints turn out to be lower 
  than anticipated, there may be a need for abrupt reduction in emissions and 
  premature retirement of equipment. In other words, even if the permanent costs 
  of an option (in case of perfect expectation) are lower than those of an alternative 
  option, it may be the case that its transition costs are higher because of inertia. 
  For example, two ideal transportation systems can be envisaged, one relying 
  on gasoline, the other on electric cars and railways, both with comparable costs 
  in a stabilized situation; however, a brutal transition from the first system 
  to the second may be economically disruptive and politically unsustainable. 
  These issues are examined in more depth in <a href="379.htm">Chapter 10</a> 
  because the selection of the ultimate target depends upon the decision-making 
  framework and upon the nature of the damage functions. But, it matters here 
  to insist on the fact that the more inertia is built into the technical system, 
  and the less processes of learning by doing and induced technical change have 
  operated, the more costly corrections of trajectories in hedging strategies 
  will be, for example, moving from a 550ppmv concentration goal to 450ppmv (Ha-Duong 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1997; see also Grubb <i>et al.,</i> 1995; Grubb, 1997). This 
  possibility of switching from one objective to another is supported by current 
  material regarding climate damages, in particular (Tol, 1996) if the rate of 
  change is considered in the analysis and the delay between symptoms and the 
  response by society (see <a href="379.htm">Chapter 10</a>).<br>
