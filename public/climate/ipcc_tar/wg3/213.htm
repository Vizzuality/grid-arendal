<h3>5.4.4 Energy Supply </h3>
<p>There are two primary types of options available for reducing emissions. One 
  is to increase the efficiency of energy supply, and the second is to switch 
  from carbon intensive fuels to low or no carbon content sources of energy. The 
  two options face different categories of barriers and the most relevant are 
  described in this section.</p>
<p><i>Energy Prices </i><br>
  Low prices are, in part, a consequence of direct and indirect subsidies to producers, 
  and the non-inclusion of external costs in their production and use (Watson 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996; Harou <i>et al</i>., 1998). It is common in the energy supply sector 
  to find price policies (public or private) which do not reflect the &#147;full 
  costs&#148;. These full costs include environmental externalities, which, for 
  example, are not included in any coal transaction or gasoline prices in the 
  United States. Producers and users of new energy technologies are not usually 
  rewarded for the associated environmental benefits (World Bank, 1999).</p>
<p><i>Lack of Consistency in the Evaluation of Energy Costs </i><br>
  Closely related to the price barrier faced by clean fuels is the selective evaluation 
  of energy costs from different energy sources. There is a need to make a comprehensive 
  evaluation of all costs and benefits. </p>
<p><i>Lack of Adequate Financial Support </i><br>
  Multilateral development banks, public banks, and private banks generally do 
  not offer soft credit, or programmes aimed specifically at energy technologies. 
  This acts as a further barrier to capital-intensive energy projects. The absence, 
  up until now, of specific programmes and an administrative process adapted to 
  this type of project has resulted in high transaction costs and a lack of discussion 
  of this key issue as a solution in the climate change problem. The role of a 
  multilateral system could be especially important for the development of a hydropower 
  programme, financing of regional interconnections, and developing small, sound 
  environmental technologies for energy supply like mini hydro, solar, and wind.</p>
<p><i>Institutional Transformation and Reforms</i> <br>
  Privately-owned generation, transmission, and distribution entities are playing 
  increasingly large roles in electric utility systems worldwide. Many national 
  power utility systems have been totally or partially privatized.</p>
<p>The liberalization of the power industry, which introduces competition within 
  the generation segment, could have a significant impact on the viability of 
  renewable sources. Some observers may argue that subsidies of any sort are antithetical 
  to the concept of a deregulated market, and that the purpose of liberalization 
  is precisely to eliminate such subsidies and market distortion. In competitive 
  markets where the process is replaced by the market-driven decisions of generation 
  companies subsidies to renewable sources may become less acceptable (Bouille, 
  1998).</p>
<p>Segmentation of the electricity chain may reduce the incentives for electricity 
  companies, especially electricity distribution companies, to act on end-use 
  efficiency (Poole <i>et al</i>., 1995).</p>
<p>There are institutional and administrative difficulties associated with the 
  development of technology transfer contracts. These are necessary to qualify 
  regional construction companies as partners in any undertaking. There is a need 
  for greater regional co-operation among developing countries in both research 
  and development, and the development of an international commercial contracting 
  network, to improve technology transfer.</p>
<p>Along with the institutional difficulties of technology transfer projects, 
  high transaction and implementation costs act as barriers as well. Often, cost 
  estimations of new technologies do not include items related to transaction 
  costs or items associated with technology penetration (policy implementation 
  costs). Both transaction costs and policy implementation costs are additional 
  expenses to technology transfer, limiting competitiveness and market potential.</p>
<p><i>Legal and Regulatory Framework </i><br>
  Many energy supply sources are subject to a lack of regulation other than for 
  safety, inadequate tariffs for transport and distribution, and no incentives 
  to increase efficiency. For example, there is often no penalty for natural gas 
  flaring. This reduces the motivation for improving the efficiency of the supply 
  chain of such sources.</p>
<p>If electric utility companies sell electricity within a regulatory system that 
  allows them to recover all operating expenses, including taxes and a fair return 
  for their investments, they will show no interest in increasing their efficiency. 
  Within this system, utilities will be reimbursed the operational costs independent 
  of the quality of the service offered (US DOE, 1996).</p>
<p>Distributed electricity generators often face a complex bureaucratic process 
  for authorizing the construction and operation of co-generation facilities. 
  Complicated terms of grid connection, as well as technical, economic, and institutional 
  rules limit access to the grid for distributed generators (Verbruggen, 1990,1992, 
  1996).</p>
<p><i>Lack of Information </i><br>
  While lack of information on energy technology performance, technical, and economic 
  characteristics is not a very significant barrier in the energy supply sector, 
  this market failure is related to market transparency. The inability of the 
  private market to provide generic information (no transparency), and the possibility 
  that &#147;in the field&#148; operation of a technology may differ from controlled 
  environment operation by a technology producer, both increase uncertainty and 
  risk in an investment. These problems are extensions of the information barrier<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn5.htm#4","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>4</sup></small></a>.</p>
<p>Developed countries generally have more capital and technological resources 
  than do developing countries (World Bank, 1999). This can greatly affect the 
  decision-making process in developing countries, as they may not have the newest 
  knowledge to adequately assess new technology opportunities. </p>
