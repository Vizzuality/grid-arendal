<h3>5.3.5 Market Structure and Functioning </h3>
<p>Market failures related to pricing, information and institutional imperfections 
  are discussed elsewhere in this section. In this subsection a variety of other 
  barriers and opportunities related to the behaviour of market actors and the 
  features of specific markets are considered. The majority of these opportunities 
  and barriers affect the demand for higher energy efficiency, but in many developing 
  and transitioning countries there are also problems on the supply side of markets. 
</p>
<p>In considering opportunities and barriers related to market behaviour and features, 
  it is important to recognize that consumers (broadly defined to include households, 
  firms, and other actors) and producers and/or providers in specific markets 
  are in continual communication. In general, suppliers deliver what they think 
  consumers want. But in markets characterized by a high degree of inertia or 
  aversion to risk on the part of suppliers, there may be latent demand for higher 
  levels of energy efficiency than are readily available in the market. Suppliers 
  may not expend the effort to cultivate the demand for more efficient products 
  or to develop marketing approaches to help overcome some of the barriers on 
  the demand side (such as financing schemes).</p>
<p>The importance of particular barriers varies among specific markets. On the 
  demand side, barriers tend to be greater with respect to households and small 
  firms than with large companies, who are more able to evaluate investments. 
  Similarly, in markets where the supply side is heavily comprised of small firms 
  with low levels of technical, managerial, and marketing skills, the barriers 
  tend to be higher.</p>
<p><i>Network Externalities</i><b> </b><br>
  Some technologies operate in such a way that any given user&#146;s equipment 
  interacts with the equipment of other users so as to create what economists 
  call network externalities (David, 1985; Katz and Shapiro, 1986). For example, 
  since vehicles must be refuelled, the attractiveness of vehicles using alternative 
  fuels is very dependent on the availability of convenient sites for refuelling. 
  Furthermore, the development of a rich infrastructure devoted to distributing 
  any given fuel is, in turn, dependent on there being sufficient vehicles using 
  that fuel to generate a large demand for that infrastructure. This need to create 
  an interacting network of equipment and infrastructure can be a barrier to the 
  diffusion of new technology, in that a potentially superior technology may have 
  difficulty diffusing because of the lack of necessary infrastructure, while 
  the diffusion of the infrastructure is impeded by the low diffusion of the new 
  vehicles.</p>
