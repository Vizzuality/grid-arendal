<h4>6.2.1.3 Liberalization and Restructuring of Energy Markets </h4>
<p>Liberalization of energy markets gives the suppliers greater freedom in the 
  extraction, processing, generation, transportation, and distribution or supply 
  of energy products and the consumers greater freedom to choose from different 
  providers (WEC, 1998). In the electricity subsector, the separation of transmission 
  from generation followed the realization that only transmission is a natural 
  monopoly (Hunt and Shuttleworth, 1996). Recently, various measures have been 
  taken to liberalize energy markets. The EU, for instance, adopted rules to liberalize 
  its electricity market (IEA, 1997a), which became operational early in 1999 
  (although some EU countries, such as the UK, had started earlier). It is expected 
  that this will be followed soon by rules regarding a liberalization of the natural 
  gas market.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#18","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>18</sup></small></a> 
  In the USA, as a result of changes in policies at both federal and state levels, 
  the generation and sales of electricity are being opened to competition. Liberalization 
  of the energy markets in developing countries and EITs has, in many cases, been 
  part of the macroeconomic restructuring in these countries. Both in Africa and 
  Latin America, one of the main driving forces behind the reform of the power 
  sector is to attract private capital to expand and improve the sector.</p>
<p>Although these policies are mainly inspired by the wish to increase competition 
  in the energy and power markets, they can have, through their impact on the 
  choice of production technology, significant emissions implications. Energy 
  restructuring may include regulation of the transmission monopoly, environmental 
  cost internalization, and system-benefit charges (SBCs; see Boxes 6.6 and 6.7). 
  Several studies have examined the effects on GHG emissions of the restructuring 
  of the electricity industry, but the issue is far from resolved. Indications 
  are that the impacts can be either positive or negative (IEA, 1998b). The degrees 
  of the environmental effects of liberalization of the electric utility industry 
  are case specific and depend on pre-existing circumstances (e.g., fuel mix, 
  vintage of plant, taxation schemes, and other factors). They also depend on 
  such factors as national endowment of resources, the fuel mix, the vintage structure 
  of generation capacity, scope for restructuring, and the size and speed of policy 
  reform (OECD, 1999). In short, energy-sector structural reform cannot, in itself, 
  guarantee a shift towards less carbon-intensive power generation.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#19","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>19</sup></small></a> 
  On the whole, however, it may provide for a more economically driven behaviour 
  that would be more responsive to price signals placed on GHG emissions.</p>
<p>Finally, the impacts of energy-sector structural reforms can be enhanced if 
  appropriate additional policy measures are taken,<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#20","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>20</sup></small></a> 
  such as demand-side management (DSM). An example of the latter is the British 
  Energy Savings Trust, which was set up 3 years after restructuring the UK energy 
  markets, in 1992, to finance DSM programmes run by regional electric companies.</p>
<p>According to an IEA study (IEA, 1999a), in the UK energy sector the structural 
  reforms in the electricity, coal, and gas supply sectors reduced the share of 
  electricity generated from coal from 65% in 1990 to 35% in 1997. This resulted 
  from closure of older coal-fired plants and the construction of combined cycle 
  gas turbines. In countries where the electricity systems are largely based on 
  non-fossil fuels, like Brazil, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, competition 
  without environmental regulation may well lead to increased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, 
  as gas-fired power stations often will be the most economically attractive option 
  for the development of new capacity.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#21","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>21</sup></small></a> 
</p>
<p>In Japan, after liberalization of the power-generation market several independent 
  power producers entered it. However, around 85% of their fuels were coal and 
  residual oil that, though inexpensive, emit more CO<sub>2</sub> per unit of 
  power generated. With the liberalization of the retail market, adopted in 2000 
  for large power users, it is possible that the construction of an atomic power 
  or liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, both of which require a longer lead time 
  and a huge investment, will become difficult. This may lead to adverse effects 
  in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Sagawa, 1998).</p>
<p>Several studies in the USA have tried to quantify the potential impacts of 
  restructuring the electricity industry on GHG emissions (see Lee and Darani, 
  1995; Rosen et al., 1995; US FERC, 1996; Palmer and Burtraw, 1997). The FERC 
  study suggests that there would be no significant increase in total CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions. The other studies, however, 
  suggest that the impact of a more open transmission grid on CO<sub>2</sub> and 
  NO<sub>x</sub> emissions could be substantial. A more recent study by the US 
  Department of Energy&#146;s (DOE) Office of Policy found that the restructuring 
  envisioned under the Comprehensive Electricity Competition Act (CECA) will lead 
  to 145&#150;220 megatonnes (Mt) less CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2010 than would 
  have occurred in the absence of an explicit policy to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions from the electricity sector (US DOE, 1999).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#22","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>22</sup></small></a> 
</p>
<p>There is a growth in literature that focuses on the impacts of liberalization 
  and restructuring of energy markets on the key technologies of interest in the 
  context of GHG reduction, such as energy efficiency, co-generation, and renewables.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#23","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>23</sup></small></a>
