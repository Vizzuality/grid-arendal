<h4>8.2.4.2.2 Evaluation of the Studies</h4>
<p>Almost all the studies analyze the effects of a GHG reduction policy through 
  a tax on carbon. The ranges of the tax are from modest levels (RMB Y9/tC<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>7</sup></small></a>) 
  in 2010 for Garbaccio<i> et al.</i> (2000), US$10/tC for Burtraw <i>et al</i>. 
  (1999); up to high levels (US$254/tC for Dessus and O&#146;Connor (1999), and 
  US$840/tC for Brendemoen and Vennemo (1994). The US studies employ relatively 
  modest taxes, between US$10/tC and US$67/tC. Only two studies consider alternative 
  programmes: Aunan <i>et al.</i> (2000) considers a National Efficiency Programme, 
  and Cifuentes<i> et al. </i>(2000) considers energy efficiency improvements. 
  The level of abatement considered by these two studies is relatively modest, 
  however.</p>
<p><i>Baseline</i><br>
  An analysis of ancillary benefits requires a time line and a clear definition 
  of the key constituents of the baseline against which the prospective scenario 
  can be measured, including the economic, demographic, regulatory<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#8","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>8</sup></small></a>, 
  environmental<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#9","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>9</sup></small></a>, and technological conditions, 
  and their implications for emissions or other inputs to an ancillary benefit 
  calculation. </p>
<p>The importance of the baseline is evident in a review of previous studies for 
  the USA in Burtraw<i> et al. </i>(1999). Assessments varied in their estimates 
  of ancillary benefits, chiefly because they employed different assumptions regarding 
  the regulatory baselines, that is the 1990 US Clean Air Act Amendments and, 
  especially, the tradable permit programme for SO<sub>2</sub>. Among these baseline 
  parameters, the most critical are the spatial location of emissions relevant 
  to potentially exposed populations, regulatory conditions, and available technologies 
  (Morgenstern, 2000). The importance of the location of emission reductions and 
  exposed populations means that highly disaggregated models are the preferred 
  tools of analysis. This may conflict with other goals for the analysis of GHG 
  mitigation strategies. For example, large CGE models, which are used for cost 
  estimation, operate at a different scale than the more localized models relevant 
  to estimating ancillary benefits.</p>
<p><i>Economic Modelling</i><br>
  Most of the studies in <a href="335.htm#tab85">Table 8.5</a> use static or dynamic 
  CGE models (one uses an econometric model) that provide T-D and sectorally aggregate 
  estimates of ancillary benefits and/or costs. The Burtraw <i>et al.</i> (1999) 
  model stands out for the location specificity of its economic model (although 
  only for the electricity sector), which permits more credible modelling of population 
  exposure reductions than that from spatially aggregate models. Another specific 
  feature is its detailed representation of investment choices and their dependence 
  on other factors covered in the model. Finally, several studies do not use an 
  economic model. Instead, they follow a B-U approach, positing some increase 
  in energy efficiency or reduction in carbon and estimating the ancillary benefits 
  that would result, at a reasonably detailed spatial level. Such studies suffer 
  from not accounting for behavioural adjustments, such as energy substitutions, 
  which could alter their estimates of ancillary benefits considerably. The high 
  ratio of ancillary benefits to the carbon tax for Garbaccio<i> et al.</i> (1999) 
  appears to arise from very optimistic assumptions about energy substitution 
  elasticities.</p>
<p><i>Emissions and Environmental Media Modelling</i><br>
  All the studies in <a href="335.htm#tab85">Table 8.5</a> account for the most 
  important pollutant affecting public health &#150; particulates. Most, however, 
  do not consider secondary particulate formation from SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>, 
  or do so in a very simplistic manner. In a developing country, direct particulate 
  emissions are likely to be a large fraction of particulate mass, making the 
  lack of attention to secondary products less important. In developed countries, 
  however, secondary products are likely to be far more important than primary 
  particulates. Omitting these products could bias ancillary benefit estimates 
  downwards; using proportionality assumptions or other simple approaches raises 
  uncertainties and may carry biases. Only one study considered lead emissions 
  (Dessus and O&#146;Connoer, 1999); few address ozone.</p>
<p>The Abt study (Abt Associates and Pechan-Avanti Group, 1999) is the most comprehensive 
  in its modelling of secondary particulate formation and dispersion. It found 
  that 12 urban areas in the USA would come into compliance with the recently 
  promulgated standard for particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>10</sup></small></a> 
  for a carbon tax of US$67 (US$1996). Without this tax, these areas would not 
  be able to meet the new standard. With there being at best sparse information 
  on the actual PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in US urban areas, these estimates 
  should be viewed as highly speculative.</p>
<p><i>Health Effects Modelling</i><br>
  Three recent studies (Hagler-Bailly 1995; Lee <i>et al.,</i> 1995; European 
  Commission, 1999) developed methods that set the stage for much of the recent 
  estimates of ancillary benefits. However, studies that draw on this literature, 
  but reduce its information to coefficients that link emissions directly to health 
  effects (or values) ignore spatial and demographic heterogeneity. This is particularly 
  so when such coefficients are generated for one country or region and then directly 
  applied to another, without taking into account local conditions. In the absence 
  of country-specific information, transfer of risk information may be made between 
  countries, with appropriate caveats to take into account underlying differences 
  in health status, access to care, and other important factors (see <a href="#box82">Box 
  8.2</a>).</p>

    <td class="box"><b>Box 8.2.</b> <i>The Impact of Air Pollution on Health Differs 
      by Country</i> 
      <p>For any society, deaths at earlier ages result in more productive years 
        of life lost than for those that occur at later ages. One study in Delhi, 
        India, found that children under 5 and adults over 65 years of age are 
        not at risk from air pollution, because other causes of death (notably 
        infectious diseases) predominated in those who survive to reach these 
        age groups (Cropper <i>et al.,</i> 1997). However, people between 15 and 
        45 years of age are at increased risk of death from air pollution relative 
        to those in developed countries. Since the population distribution in 
        India includes many more people in these middle age groups, the net impact 
        on the country from air pollution measured in terms of years of life lost 
        is similar to that of a developed country.</p>

<p><a name="box82"></a>Most of the studies rely on concentration&#150;response 
  functions from the literature on health, and apply them using a standard methodology 
  (Ostro, 1996; EPA, 1999). The most important health effects are premature mortality 
  and chronic respiratory effects. </p>
<p>Aside from differences in the base rates of the effects<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#11","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>11</sup></small></a>, 
  due to local characteristics such as the age distribution of the population 
  and health care services, other factors help explain the different outcomes 
  of the studies. First, some use PM<sub>10</sub>, while others use fine particles 
  (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), or serveral components of them (sulphates and nitrates). 
  When the individual components of PM<sub>2.5</sub> are used, the implicit assumption 
  is that their risk is similar to that of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. To date, this has 
  not been verified (especially for nitrates, the secondary particulate product 
  from NO<sub>x</sub> emissions). Second, studies that look at age groups separately 
  generally report higher impacts (Aunan <i>et al.</i> (2000), for example, used 
  a steeper dose&#150;response coefficient for people older than 65 years of age 
  than that used by other studies). Very few consider the chronic effects on mortality, 
  derived from cohort studies (e.g., Pope <i>et al., </i>1995) (Abt Associates 
  and Pechan-Avanti Group, 1999 is one, while others consider it for their &#147;high 
  estimate&#148; only). Use of the latter results in estimates of death three 
  times larger than use of the time series studies. Also, few studies consider 
  effects on child mortality. Finally, different studies consider different health 
  endpoints, which is important for reconciling morbidity estimates.</p>
<p><i>Valuation of Effects</i><br>
  The most important monetary benefit is related to mortality risk reductions, 
  which can be expressed in terms of the VSL (see <a href="266.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>). The VSL should ideally be indigenously estimated (Krupnick <i>et al.,</i> 
  2000)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#12","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>12</sup></small></a> but almost of the studies build 
  on a consensus on the appropriate values to use (Davis <i>et al.,</i> 2000), 
  given the state of research on valuation (albeit concentrated in the UK and 
  USA).</p>
<p>A major difference in the treatment of values across the studies is whether 
  these values are adjusted for different income levels and increased for future 
  income growth. Adjustments that assume an income elasticity of willingness to 
  pay (WTP) of 1.0 are inconsistent with the admittedly thin literature. A number 
  of studies found elasticities in the 0.2-0.6 range based on income differentials 
  <i>within</i> a country. Such elasticities, when applied to transfers <i>among</i> 
  countries, yield quite high values. Most of the developing country ancillary 
  benefit studies reported in <a href="336.htm">Table 8.6</a> use an income elasticity 
  of 1.0. The US Science Advisory Board has endorsed the idea of making adjustments 
  for future income growth within a country. </p>
<p>The state of the art of the valuation of air pollution-related mortality effects 
  is currently in ferment, with serious questions being raised about the inappropriateness 
  of basing such valuation on labour market studies. Ad hoc adjustments for the 
  shorter life span of those thought to be most affected by air pollution (the 
  elderly and ill) have been made but more credible estimates of willingness to 
  pay await new research. Such efforts are more likely to lower such estimates 
  relative to current estimates than raise them (see Davis<i> et al., </i>2000 
  and Krupnick <i>et al.,</i> 2000). </p>
<p><i>Environmental Externalities</i><br>
  All the studies, except those in the USA, assume that improvements in public 
  health count as externalities and, hence, as ancillary benefits. As noted in 
  Krupnick<i> et al.</i> (2000), this assumption may not always hold. Burtraw 
  <i>et al.</i> (1999) and Abt Associates and Pechan-Avanti Group (1999) count 
  the abatement cost savings from reducing SO<sub>2</sub> emissions in response 
  to a carbon tax because SO<sub>2</sub> emissions are capped in the USA. Similar 
  adjustments are not made for SO<sub>2</sub> and other pollutant taxation in 
  Europe. Moreover, not all ancillary benefits are necessarily externalities. 
  In some cases, these effects may be already &#147;internalized&#148; in the 
  price of goods and services: for example, where accident insurance against road 
  fatalities exists, much of this effect is already accounted for through purchasing 
  insurance and the penalties for failure to obtain it.</p>
<p><i>Treatment of Uncertainty</i><br>
  The uncertainty that surrounds the estimates of benefits is no less than that 
  associated with mitigation costs, extending from physical modelling, through 
  valuation, to modelling choices. Several of the studies use Monte Carlo simulation, 
  but others use less sophisticated sensitivity analyses to characterize uncertainties.</p>
<p><i>Allowance for Ancillary Costs</i><br>
  None of the studies reviewed in this assessment reported estimates of ancillary 
  costs. Some studies, such as Burtraw <i>et al.</i> (1999), discuss the bounce-back 
  effect associated with energy substitution to natural gas and other less carbon-intensive 
  fuels. However, even these studies, not surprisingly, estimate positive net 
  ancillary benefits from GHG mitigation policies. The issue is whether the models 
  were designed to capture ancillary costs. In general, our conclusion is no, 
  except for fossil fuel substitution in the power and transport sectors. From 
  an energy substitution perspective, substitution to nuclear power or hydropower 
  does not generate reported ancillary costs because these ancillary effects are 
  not present in the studies. Other sources of ancillary costs were also left 
  out of the modelling exercise, either because of model boundaries or through 
  making some standard modelling choices. All the studies examined effects on 
  one country or region, and therefore do not consider the leakage effect. None 
  of the studies considered health linkages that might result from slower income 
  and employment growth following the implementation of a GHG mitigation policy.<br>
