<h4>10.1.2.3 Associated Human Activities Are Pervasive </h4>
<p><i>Control of greenhouse gas concentrations implies eventual limitations on 
  energy-related emissions</i><br>
  Energy is the single largest source of GHG emissions. It is responsible for 
  approximately 80% of net carbon emissions to the atmosphere. While net emissions 
  of carbon are associated with fossil fuel combustion, the carbon-to-energy ratio 
  varies between high-carbon fuels, such as coal, and low-carbon fuels, such as 
  CH<sub>4</sub>, approximately by a factor of two. Technologies such as hydroelectric 
  power, nuclear fission, wind power, and solar power are generally treated as 
  if they have little or no direct carbon emissions, though this may not be the 
  case. For example, CH<sub>4</sub> may be released in the process of creating 
  a hydroelectric facility and carbon may be released in the manufacture of cement 
  used in nuclear power reactors. Technologies do exist that can biologically 
  sequester or physically remove and store carbon. Thus, in principle, controlling 
  energy-related carbon emissions is possible for several sources of carbon emissions 
  without foregoing fossil fuel use. These technologies are discussed in <a href="089.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>. </p>
<p><i>Narrowly defined technological solutions are unavailable, but a broad development 
  and deployment of technology is key to controlling the cost of emissions limitation	
  <br>
  </i>Emissions of GHGs are associated with an extraordinary array of human activities. 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are associated with the combustion of fossil fuels 
  and changes in land-use. They are thus affected by activities that range from, 
  for example, household heating and cooling to commercial lighting and appliances, 
  to the transportation of goods and provision of services, to the manufacture 
  of materials, to the growth and harvest of crops, and to the generation of electric 
  power. As a consequence, GHG emissions are greatly affected by other exogenous 
  and non-climate-policy factors. Narrowly defined technological solutions, such 
  as were available to address the problem of stratospheric ozone depletion, are 
  impossible for the climate issue. While no single technology provides a complete 
  solution to the problem of controlling emissions of GHGs, a significant set 
  of existing, emerging, and potential technologies is available to mitigation 
  climate change, as discussed in <a href="068.htm">Chapters 2</a>, <a href="089.htm">3</a> 
  and <a href="155.htm">4</a><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>2</sup></small></a>.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small></small></a></p>
<p><i>Policy interactions will be significant</i><br>
  Future emissions depend to a large degree on the rate and direction of technological 
  developments in a broad array of human endeavours. For example, China&#146;s 
  policies to stabilize its population size, taken for reasons unrelated to climate 
  change, will have a profound effect on Chinese emissions of GHGs to the atmosphere. 
  Policies to control non-GHG air pollutants can greatly affect GHG emissions. 
  For example, measures to substitute natural gas and non-carbon-emitting energy 
  forms, such as solar and nuclear power, for coal in electricity generation to 
  control local and regional air pollution can affect GHG emissions as well. On 
  the other hand, some policies that reduce local air pollution, such as scrubbing 
  power plants for sulphur, can reduce power-plant efficiency and increase GHG 
  emissions.</p>
