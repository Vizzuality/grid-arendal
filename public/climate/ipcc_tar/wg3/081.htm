<h4>2.5.1.3 A Short Description of the SRES Scenarios </h4>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" align="right">

      <p><a href="fig2-11.htm"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/images/fig2-11s.gif" width="300" height="305" border="0"></a><br>
        <b>Figure 2.11:</b> Schematic illustration of SRES scenarios. The four 
        scenario &#147;families&#148; are shown, very simplistically, for illustrative 
        purposes, as branches of a two-dimensional tree. The two dimensions shown 
        indicate global and regional scenario orientation, and development and 
        environmental orientation, respectively. In reality, the four scenarios 
        share a space of a much higher dimensionality given the numerous driving 
        forces and other assumptions needed to define any given scenario in a 
        particular modelling approach. The schematic diagram illustrates that 
        the scenarios build on the main driving forces of GHG emissions. Each 
        scenario family is based on a common specification of some of the main 
        driving forces. </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Since there is no agreement on how the future will unfold, the SRES tried to 
  sharpen the view of alternatives by assuming that individual scenarios have 
  diverging tendencies &#151; one emphasizes stronger economic values, the other 
  stronger environmental values; one assumes increasing globalization, the other 
  increasing regionalization. Combining these choices yielded four different scenario 
  families (<a href="#fig211">Figure 2.11</a>). This two-dimensional representation 
  of the main SRES scenario characteristics is an oversimplification. It is shown 
  just as an illustration. In fact, to be accurate, the space would need to be 
  multi-dimensional, listing other scenario developments in many different social, 
  economic, technological, environmental, and policy dimensions. </p>
<p>The titles of the four scenario storylines and families have been kept simple: 
  A1, A2, B1, and B2. There is no particular order among the storylines; they 
  are listed in alphabetical and numerical order:<br>
<ul>
  <li> The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very rapid 
    economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and declines 
    thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. 
    Major underlying themes are convergence among regions, capacity building, 
    and increased cultural and social interactions, with a substantial reduction 
    in regional differences in per capita income. The A1 scenario family develops 
    into three groups that describe alternative directions of technological change 
    in the energy system. The three A1 groups are distinguished by their technological 
    emphasis: fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy sources (A1T), or a balance 
    across all sources (A1B).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#12","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>12</sup></small></a><br>
  <li> The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world. 
    The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local identities. 
    Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which results in continuously 
    increasing global population. Economic development is primarily regionally 
    oriented and per capita economic growth and technological change are more 
    fragmented and slower than in other storylines.<br>
  <li> The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with 
    the same global population that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, 
    as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid changes in economic structures towards 
    a service and information economy, with reductions in material intensity, 
    and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies. The emphasis 
    is on global solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability, 
    including improved equity, but without additional climate initiatives.<br>
  <li> The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis 
    is on local solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability. 
    It is a world with a continuously increasing global population at a rate lower 
    than in A2, intermediate levels of economic development, and less rapid and 
    more diverse technological change than in the B1 and A1 storylines. While 
    the scenario is also oriented towards environmental protection and social 
    equity, it focuses on local and regional levels. 
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>In all, six models were used to generate the 40 scenarios that comprise the 
  four scenario families. They are listed in <a href="#tab25">Table 2.5</a>. These 
  six models are representative of emissions scenario modelling approaches and 
  different integrated assessment frameworks in the literature, and include so-called 
  top-down and bottom-up models.</p>

        for many subsequent studies). The 40 SRES scenarios are classified into 
        six groups. Jointly the scenarios span most of the range of the scenarios 
        in the literature. The emissions profiles are dynamic, ranging from continuous 
        increases to those that curve through a maximum and then decline. The

<p><a href="#fig212">Figure 2.12</a> illustrates the range of global energy-related 
  and industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the 40 SRES scenarios against the 
  background of all the 400 emissions scenarios from the literature documented 
  in the SRES scenario database. The six scenario groups are represented by the 
  six illustrative scenarios. <a href="#fig212">Figure 2.12</a> also shows a range 
  of emissions of the six scenario groups next to each of the six illustrative 
  scenarios. </p>
<p><a href="#fig212">Figure 2.12</a> shows that the four marker and two illustrative 
  scenarios by themselves cover a large portion of the overall scenario distribution. 
  This is one of the reasons that the SRES Writing Team recommended the use of 
  all four marker and two illustrative scenarios in future assessments. Together, 
  they cover most of the uncertainty of future emissions, both with respect to 
  the scenarios in the literature and the full SRES scenario set. <a href="#fig212">Figure 
  2.12</a> also shows that they are not necessarily close to the median of the 
  scenario family because of the nature of the selection process. For example, 
  A2 and B1 are at the upper and lower bounds of their scenario families, respectively. 
  The range of global energy-related and industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for 
  the six illustrative SRES scenarios is generally somewhat lower than the range 
  of the IPCC IS92 scenarios (Leggett <i>et al.</i>, 1992; Pepper <i>et al.</i>, 1992). Adding 
  the other 36 SRES scenarios increases the covered emissions range. Jointly, 
  the SRES scenarios cover the relevant range of global emissions, from the 95th 
  percentile at the high end of the distribution all the way down to very low 
  emissions just above the 5th percentile of the distribution. Thus, they only 
  exclude the most extreme emissions scenarios found in the literature &#150; 
  those situated out in the tails of the distribution. What is perhaps more important 
  is that each of the four scenario families covers a sizable part of this distribution, 
  implying that a similar quantification of driving forces can lead to a wide 
  range of future emissions. More specifically, a given combination of the main 
  driving forces is not sufficient to uniquely determine a future emission path. 
  There are too many uncertainties. The fact that each of the scenario families 
  covers a substantial part of the literature range also leads to an overlap in 
  the emissions ranges of the four families. This implies that a given level of 
  future emissions can arise from very different combinations of driving forces. 
  This result is of fundamental importance for assessments of climate change impacts 
  and possible mitigation and adaptation strategies. </p>
<p>An important feature of the SRES scenarios obtained using the SAR methodology 
  is that their overall radiative forcing is higher than the IS92 range despite 
  comparatively lower GHG emissions (Wigley and Raper, 1992; Wigley <i>et al.</i>, 1994; 
  Houghton <i>et al.</i>, 1996; Wigley, 1999; Smith <i>et al.</i>, 2000; IPCC, 2001). This results 
  from the loss of sulphur-induced cooling during the second half of the 21st 
  century. On one hand, the reduction in global sulphur emissions reduces the 
  role of sulphate aerosols in determining future climate, and therefore reduces 
  one aspect of uncertainty about future climate change (because the precise forcing 
  effect of sulphate aerosols is highly uncertain). On the other hand, uncertainty 
  increases because of the diversity in spatial patterns of SO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  in the scenarios. Future assessments of possible climate change need to account 
  for these different spatial and temporal dynamics of GHG and sulphur emissions, 
  and they need to cover the whole range of radiative forcing associated with 
  the scenarios.</p>
<p>In summary, the SRES scenarios lead to the following findings:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Alternative combinations of driving-force variables can lead to similar 
    levels and structure of energy use and land-use patterns, as illustrated by 
    the various scenario groups and scenarios. Hence, even for a given scenario 
    outcome, for example, in terms of GHG emissions, there are alternative combinations 
    and alternative pathways that could lead to that outcome. For instance, significant 
    global changes could result from a scenario of high population growth, even 
    if per capita incomes would rise only modestly, as well as from a scenario 
    in which a rapid demographic transition (low population levels) coincides 
    with high rates of income growth and affluence. <br>
  <li> Important possibilities for further bifurcations in future development 
    trends exist within one scenario family, even when adopting certain values 
    for important scenario driving force variables to illustrate a particular 
    possible development path.<br>
  <li> Emissions profiles are dynamic across the range of SRES scenarios. They 
    portray trend reversals and indicate possible emissions crossover among different 
    scenarios. They do not represent mere extensions of a continuous increase 
    of GHGs and sulphur emissions into the future. This more complex pattern of 
    future emissions across the range of SRES scenarios reflects the recent scenario 
    literature.<br>
  <li> Describing potential future developments involves inherent ambiguities 
    and uncertainties. One and only one possible development path (as alluded 
    to for instance in concepts such as &#147;business-as-usual scenario&#148;) 
    simply does not exist. And even for each alternative development path described 
    by any given scenario, there are numerous combinations of driving forces and 
    numerical values that can be consistent with a particular scenario description. 
    This particularly applies to the A2 and B2 scenarios that imply a variety 
    of regional development patterns that are wider than in the A1 and B1 scenarios. 
    The numerical precision of any model result should not distract from the basic 
    fact that uncertainty abounds. However, in the opinion of the SRES writing 
    team, the multi-model approach increases the value of the SRES scenario set, 
    since uncertainties in the choice of model input assumptions can be more explicitly 
    separated from the specific model behaviour and related modelling uncertainties.<br>
  <li> Any scenario has subjective elements and is open to various interpretations. 
    While the SRES writing team as a whole has no preference for any of the scenarios, 
    and has no judgement about the probability or desirability of the scenarios, 
    the open process and reactions to SRES scenarios have shown that individuals 
    and interest groups do have such judgements. This will stimulate an open discussion 
    in the political arena about potential futures and choices that can be made 
    in the context of climate change response. For the scientific community, the 
    SRES scenario exercise has led to the identification of a number of recommendations 
    for future research that can further increase understanding about potential 
    development of socio-economic driving forces and their interactions, and associated 
    GHG emissions. <br>
