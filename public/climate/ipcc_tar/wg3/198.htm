<h3>5.3.8 Social, Cultural, and Behavioural Norms and Aspirations </h3>
<p>Perhaps the most significant barriers to GHG mitigation, and yet the greatest 
  opportunities, are linked to social, cultural, and behavioural norms and aspirations. 
  In particular, success in GHG mitigation may well depend on understanding the 
  social, cultural, and psychological forces that shape consumption patterns.</p>
<h4><a name="5381"></a>5.3.8.1 Experience from Energy Efficiency Programmes</h4>
<p>Conventional policy development is based on a model of human motivation that 
  has been widely criticized (Stern, 1986; Jacobs, 1997; Jaeger <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
  People are assumed to be rational welfare-maximizers and to have fixed values, 
  which, along with the information and means available to them, determine their 
  behaviour. Practical analysis of energy efficiency and other GHG mitigation 
  options often makes the narrower assumption that people are cost-minimizers 
  (Komor and Wiggins, 1988). Such assumptions are undermined by experience with 
  energy efficiency programmes. It has long been recognized that consumers do 
  not necessarily act on their stated values (Maloney and Ward, 1973; Verhallen 
  and van Raaij, 1981), and fail to take up measures that appear on paper to be 
  economically worthwhile (Stern, 1986; Komor and Wiggins, 1988). Some of the 
  reasons, such as energy price uncertainty and transaction costs, have been discussed 
  elsewhere in this chapter and are consistent with the conventional view of consumers 
  as &#147;rational actors&#148;. Another important influence on behaviour is 
  the source and quality of information on mitigation measures (the experiences 
  of friends and family are trusted more than the advice of industry, retail sales 
  staff or government) (Anderson and Claxton, 1982; Stern, 1986; Komor and Wiggins, 
  1988). It is much harder for the &#147;rational actor paradigm&#148; to accommodate 
  features of human behaviour such as the gap between attitudes and action, the 
  tendency to adopt behavioural routines rather than to optimize continually the 
  limited number of variables that individuals typically take into account in 
  their choices, and the tendency for people to rationalize their choices after 
  the fact.</p>
<p>The gap between current practice and the economic potential has been characterized 
  in this chapter as being caused by &#147;barriers&#148;. However, Shove (1999) 
  argues that the language of potentials, gaps, and barriers is itself an impediment 
  to finding socially viable solutions for energy saving, and that new, more socially-sensitive 
  approaches are needed to the analysis of measures, with researchers, industry 
  actors, and policymakers working closely together. One of the greatest challenges 
  for GHG mitigation strategies is that, for most people, neither energy saving 
  nor GHG mitigation is a high priority (see for example, Gritsevich, 2000). Consumers&#146; 
  decisions about energy use are often motivated less by cost-minimization than 
  by improving comfort and convenience (Wilhite <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
