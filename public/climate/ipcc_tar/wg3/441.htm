<h3>10.4.4. Where Should the Response Take Place? The Relationship between Domestic 
  Mitigation and the Use of International Mechanisms </h3>
<p>Inquiries into the options and costs to reduce GHGs, especially CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  emissions indicate that the costs of reductions vary substantially across sectors 
  in any given national economy and, perhaps even more significantly, across countries. 
  This implies that for uniformly mixing pollutants like GHGs the costs of achieving 
  any given level of environmental protection could be reduced if emission reductions 
  were undertaken at locations where the associated costs are lowest. The concept 
  has become known as &#147;where-flexibility&#148; in the climate policy literature. 
  An institutional setting is required to exploit the opportunities of where flexibility, 
  which involves a great variety of private and public decision-makers who originate 
  from different cultures, represent different constituencies (if any), and live 
  in systems with different social norms. Where-flexibility entails linkages both 
  to other international agreements (GATT, Second European Sulphur Protocol, etc.) 
  and to the legal systems of individual nations. As a result of its effects on 
  relative prices, the choice between the international or domestic strategy also 
  affects technological change.</p>
<p>In principle, two different mechanisms achieve where-flexibility: allowances 
  and credit baseline. In the case of allowances, each participant starts with 
  an initial endowment of pollution rights distributed by the government or through 
  an auction. Emission rights must cover each unit of emission. This system has 
  the character of emissions trading. Under a credit-baseline system, each participant 
  has a baseline (<i>i.e</i>., a counterfactual, hypothetical emission trend) 
  at the country, sector, or project level. Some measures are undertaken to reduce 
  emissions. The difference between the baseline and the factual emissions is 
  credited by an institutional body and can be traded. This system has the character 
  of emissions reduction production.</p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol contains three instruments to make use of where-flexibility: 
  IET embodies the allowance system, while CDM and JI reflect the credit-baseline 
  system. The Kyoto Protocol on I<i>et al</i>lows Annex I parties with commitments listed 
  in Annex B to trade emission allowances during the commitment period. As for 
  JI, Article 6 declares that Annex I parties with commitments listed in Annex 
  B are allowed to transfer or acquire emission reduction units that result from 
  projects during the commitment period (the reduction units are specific to countries; 
  these parties have national baselines). Finally, CDM as defined in Article 12 
  implies that, starting in 2000, Annex I parties listed in Annex B are allowed 
  to acquire certified emission reductions from projects within the jurisdictions 
  of non-Annex I parties.</p>
<p>Three general principles operate behind these arrangements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>first, voluntarism indicates the freedom of contracting, <i>i.e</i>., the 
    quantity-price combinations of exchange;<br>
  </li>
  <li>second, supplementarity signifies the responsibility of Annex I parties 
    to fulfil part of their commitments within their own jurisdictions; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>third, additionality means that projects in CDM and JI have to be additional 
    relative to the course of events in their absence (<i>i.e</i>., it must be 
    decided what would happen anyway and what constitutes an additional project).</li>
</ul>
<p>Ample attention has been paid to formulate principles for the design of where-flexibility 
  instruments at the national and international level. The principles in the literature 
  (Michaelowa, 1995; Watt <i>et al</i>., 1995; Carter <i>et al</i>., 1996; Matsuo, 1998, Matsuo 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998; OECD, 1998; Ott, 1998; EC, 1999) include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Environmental effectiveness. All units traded should be backed by sound 
    data and verifiable emissions reductions; the use of the mechanisms is a means 
    to achieve emission commitments agreed under the Protocol and the mechanisms 
    should be designed to improve environmental performance and compliance with 
    these commitments.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Economic efficiency. This includes the cost-effectiveness of the emission 
    reductions required by the Protocol, and over the longer term helping the 
    community of nations to address climate change in a least-cost manner. It 
    also requires the mechanisms to be administratively feasible, such that they 
    do not impose excessive transaction costs on market actors. Economic efficiency 
    will also improve if the market for trading and crediting is accessible to 
    a wide range of potential players.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Equity. While the main issue of equity under the Kyoto Protocol is the determination 
    of assigned amounts or emission targets, the design of the implementation 
    mechanism must also be perceived as equitable. Implementation of the mechanisms 
    should not give an unfair advantage to any party or group of parties to the 
    disadvantage of others (procedural equity). It should also allow new entrants 
    over time.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Credibility. Only a credible market mechanism should be used by the parties 
    and will be accepted by the public. A mechanism of low credibility might be 
    a source of various coalition formations at the negotiations and might undermine 
    the will to comply with the commitments.</li>
</ul>
<p>In creating a regime for flexible instruments, perhaps the most important lesson 
  about multilateral agreements of the past two decades is that large and apparently 
  &#147;perfect&#148; constructions have rarely been implemented quickly. Quite 
  the contrary, the most successful examples of international regime building 
  are based on a &#147;piecemeal&#148; approach, that is the stepwise evolution 
  of political and legal mechanisms (Ott, 1998). For current DMFs, this might 
  lead to a strategy with several phases that bring together the national and 
  international levels at the speed of progress in international regime building 
  (Holtsmark and Hagem, 1998). This would involve a two-stage game for IET (Ott, 
  1998), with a &#147;twin cycle system&#148; for JI (Heller, 1995) that focuses 
  on the learning process in creating an international regime for JI.</p>
<p>There are some new and important factors to consider in the design of the instruments 
  (see Ott, 1998). The economic and ecological dimensions of climate change and 
  its mitigation affect different constituencies, sectors, and cultural values 
  of the parties. Stakeholders range from states and international organizations 
  to private companies and NGOs. Incentives motivate both private and governmental 
  participants to report the highest possible baselines of GHG emissions to secure 
  the largest amount of certified reduction credits. However, other processes 
  create the opposite incentives.</p>
<p>The implementation of these instruments can be seen as a further step towards 
  a more flexible and market-oriented policy in international environmental policy, 
  and as an extension of national instruments to the international level. At the 
  national level, some experience has already been accumulated with emissions 
  trading, such as the Emission Trading Program under the US Acid Rain Program, 
  the Los Angeles Regional Clean Air Incentives Markets, and the Norwegian Sulphur 
  Trading programme introduced in 1999. Actual experience is much thinner internationally. 
  Examples of the possibility for emission trading include the Montreal Protocol 
  intended to curb CFC emissions that deplete the ozone layer and the United Nations 
  Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Sulphur Protocol.</p>
<p>Many plausible arguments support the use of international mechanisms, as outlined 
  below.</p>
