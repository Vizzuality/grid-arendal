<h4>7.2.2.5 Critical Assumptions in Studies of Ancillary Benefits and Co-benefits 
</h4>
<p>Policies aimed at mitigating GHGs, as stated earlier, can yield other social 
  benefits and costs (here called ancillary benefits and costs), and a number 
  of empirical studies have made a preliminary attempt to assess these impacts. 
  It is apparent that the actual magnitude of the ancillary benefits or co-benefits 
  assessed critically depends on the scenario structure of the analysis, in particular 
  on the assumptions about policy management in the baseline case (IPCC, 2000b; 
  Krupnick <i>et al</i>., 1996; Krupnick <i>et al</i>., 2000).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#5","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>5</sup></small></a> This implies that whether a 
  particular impact is included or not depends on the primary objective of the 
  programme. Moreover, something that is seen as a GHG reduction programme from 
  an international perspective may be seen, from a national perspective, as one 
  in which local pollutants and GHGs are equally important. </p>
<p>A second point is that the economic accounting of ancillary benefits depends 
  crucially on assumptions about the demographic characteristics, regulatory regime, 
  and available technology and how these will evolve. For example, consider the 
  case in which a government imposes a cap on emissions of sulphur. If a GHG mitigation 
  programme is introduced it may reduce the associated amount of sulphur produced, 
  but other activities may take up the slack and so result in no net change in 
  emissions. Alternatively, consider the situation in which the government has 
  a tax on emissions. If the tax is set equal to the marginal damage from sulphur, 
  a small mitigation programme will not generate any direct benefits in terms 
  of sulphur reductions (the value of the reductions is exactly matched by the 
  loss of charge revenue). As a third example, consider the case in which the 
  regulator has a plan to tighten the controls on local pollutants. Any GHG mitigation 
  programme that reduces the levels of these emissions has then to be valued relative 
  to the costs of achieving the dynamic baseline, and not in terms of the benefits 
  of reduced emissions themselves. To sum up, the valuation of ancillary and/or 
  co-benefits requires the policymaker to look not only at the external costs 
  of the pollutants, but also at the net costs and benefits of measures being 
  introduced to deal with them.</p>
<p>Externalities do not necessarily arise when there are effects on third parties. 
  In some cases, these effects may already be recognized, or &#147;internal&#148;, 
  contained in the price of goods and services. Consider a stylized example, such 
  as damages to vehicles in an automobile accident. If each driver is fully liable 
  for damages to other vehicles and one can reliably assess fault and enforce 
  liability, the damage in an accident would not be an externality because the 
  party at fault would fully recognize the costs. Only if the drivers are not 
  fully liable, or if fault cannot be established, or if liability is not enforceable 
  is there a justification for treating the damage to vehicles in the example 
  as an externality. The key idea is that such exceptions constitute a deviation 
  from ideal institutions. In economic vocabulary, this is referred to as market 
  failure. For damage to be considered an externality from the viewpoint of economic 
  efficiency, some kind of failure in markets or other institutions that causes 
  individuals to fail to take into account the social costs and benefits of their 
  individual actions should be identifiable. From a practical perspective, it 
  is also important that such failures result in an important misallocation of 
  resources.</p>
<p>A full discussion of the empirical relevance of ancillary and/or co-benefits 
  is provided in <a href="319.htm">Chapters 8</a> and <a href="353.htm">9</a>.</p>
