<h4>6.5.3.2 Empirical Analyses </h4>
<p>Empirical analyses<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#109","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>109</sup></small></a> 
  of the relative effects of alternative environmental policy instruments on the 
  rate and direction of technological change are limited in number, but those 
  available focus on technological change in energy efficiency, and thus are potentially 
  of direct relevance to global climate policy. These studies can be considered 
  within the three stages of technological change introduced above&#150;invention, 
  innovation, and diffusion. It is most illuminating, however, to consider the 
  three stages in reverse order.</p>
<p>Beginning, then, with empirical analyses of the effects of environmental policy 
  instruments on technology diffusion, Jaffe and Stavins (1995) conducted econometric 
  analyses of the factors that affected the adoption of thermal insulation technologies 
  in new residential construction in the USA from 1979 to 1988. They examined 
  the dynamic effects of energy prices and technology adoption costs on average 
  residential energy-efficient technologies in new home construction. The effects 
  of energy prices can be interpreted as suggesting what the likely effects of 
  taxes on energy use would be, and the effects of changes in adoption costs can 
  be interpreted as indicating what the effects of technology-adoption subsidies 
  would be. They found that the response of mean energy efficiency to energy price 
  changes was positive and significant, both statistically and economically. Interestingly, 
  they also found that equivalent percentage cost subsidies would have been about 
  three times as effective as taxes in encouraging adoption, although standard 
  financial analysis suggest they ought to be about equal in percentage terms. 
  This finding does, however, offer confirmation for the conventional wisdom that 
  technology adoption decisions are more sensitive to up-front cost considerations 
  than to longer-term operating expenses.</p>
<p>In a study of residential conservation investment tax credits, Hassett and 
  Metcalf (1995) also found that tax credit or deductions were many times more 
  effective than &#147;equivalent&#148; changes in energy prices&#150;about eight 
  times as effective in their study. They speculate that one reason for this difference 
  is that energy price movements may be perceived as temporary. The findings by 
  Jaffe and Stavins (1995), and by Hasset and Metcalf (1995) are consistent with 
  other analyses of the relative effectiveness of energy prices and technology 
  market reforms in bringing about the adoption of lifecycle cost-saving technologies. 
  Up-front subsidies can be more effective than energy price signals (see, e.g., 
  Krause <i>et al</i>., 1993; Howarth and Winslow, 1994; IPSEP, 1995; Eto <i>et al</i>., 1996; 
  Golove and Eto, 1995; IPCC, 1996, Executive Summary, p. 13). A disadvantage 
  of such non-price policies relative to administered prices is that they have 
  to be implemented on an &#147;end-use by end-use&#148; or &#147;sector by sector&#148; 
  basis in a customized fashion. Also, an effective institutional and regulatory 
  framework needs to be created and maintained to evaluate and ensure the continued 
  cost-effectiveness of such policies. </p>
<p>This and other research on energy efficiency programmes also highlights a major 
  difference in the way energy price signals and technology subsidies function. 
  The technology adoption response to taxes may include a secondary increase in 
  the demand for energy services. This secondary effect takes two forms: a direct 
  effect that results from the increased utilization of energy-using equipment 
  and capital stocks, and an indirect effect from increased disposable income. 
  Studies of such demand effects suggest that the combined effects are generally 
  not sufficient to offset more than a minor portion of emissions reductions. 
</p>
<p>In addition, technology subsidies and tax credits can require large public 
  expenditures per unit of effect, since consumers who would have purchased the 
  product even in the absence of the subsidy will still receive it.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#110","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>110</sup></small></a></p>
<p>Some recent empirical studies suggest that the response of relevant technological 
  change to energy price changes can be surprisingly swift. Typically, this is 
  less than 5 years for much of the response in terms of patenting activity and 
  the introduction of new model offerings (Jaffe and Stavins, 1995; Newell <i>et al</i>., 1999; Poppe, 1999). Substantial diffusion can sometimes take longer, depending 
  on the rate of retirement of previously installed equipment. The longevity of 
  much energy-using equipment reinforces the importance of taking a longer-term 
  view towards energy-efficiency improvements&#150;on the order of decades.</p>
<p>An optimal set of policies would be designed in such a way as to achieve two 
  outcomes simultaneously: release any obstructed emission and cost-reduction 
  potentials from already available technologies through various market reforms 
  that try to reduce market distortions (see IPCC, 2000), and induce the accelerated 
  development of new technologies. This approach allows significant carbon abatement 
  over the near-term by diffusing existing technologies, while at the same time 
  preparing new technologies for the longer term.</p>
