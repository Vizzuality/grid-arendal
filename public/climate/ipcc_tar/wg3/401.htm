<p><i>Continues from previous page</i></p>
<p>However, all the above papers also show that the size of the coalition crucially 
  affects the size of the benefits that derive from the adoption of the Kyoto 
  mechanisms. The larger the number of participating countries, and the higher 
  the variability of marginal abatement costs across them, the larger the benefits 
  from emissions trading and the clean development mechanism (CDM). Hence, to 
  reduce abatement costs and increase environmental benefits, policies, rules, 
  and institutions should be designed to achieve the largest possible coalition.</p>
<p> (c) The third question, how to broaden a climate coalition, is often related 
  to the issue of links between a climate agreement and other international agreements. 
  Indeed, two types of policy options, based respectively on economic and technological 
  transfers and on issue linkage, are often proposed as the way to achieve larger 
  climate coalitions. These policies imply that links must be established between 
  different multilateral agreements (e.g., agreements on both climate and free 
  trade or technological co-operation).</p>
<p>First, consider economic and technological transfers. It is quite natural to 
  propose these transfers to compensate those countries that may lose by signing 
  the environmental agreement. In other words, a redistribution mechanism among 
  signatories, from gainers to losers, may provide the basic requirement for a 
  self-enforcing agreement to exist, that is the profitability of the agreement 
  for all signatories. Therefore, if well designed, economic and technological 
  transfers can guarantee that no country refuses to sign the agreement because 
  it is not profitable. Moreover, Chander and Tulkens (1995, 1997) and Chander 
  <i>et al</i>. (1999) show economic and technological transfers exist such that 
  not only is each country better off within a global coalition than it is with 
  no coalition at all (the no participation case), but also it is better off within 
  a global coalition than it is in any subcoalition, provided the remaining countries 
  behave non-co-operatively (see also Markusen 1975; Germain <i>et al</i>., 1997). 
  This result is important because it implies that no country or group of countries 
  has an incentive to exclude other countries from the environmental coalition, 
  that is the grand coalition is optimal (but it may not be stable).</p>
<p>Economic and technological transfers play a major role also with respect to 
  the stability issue (Carraro and Siniscalco, 1993; Petrakis and Xepapadeas, 
  1996; Schmidt, 1997). Indeed, it is not sufficient to guarantee the profitability 
  of the environmental agreement. Incentives to free-ride also need to be offset. 
  The possibility of using self-financed economic and technological transfers 
  to stabilize environmental agreements is analysed in Carraro and Siniscalco 
  (1993) and Hoel (1994), which show that these transfers may be successful only 
  if associated with a certain degree of commitment. For example, when countries 
  are fairly symmetric, only if a group of countries is committed to co-operation 
  can another group of uncommitted countries be induced to sign the agreement 
  by a system of economic and technological transfers (Carraro and Siniscalco, 
  1993)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#13","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>13</sup></small></a>. 
  This gives developed countries the responsibility to lead the expansion of the 
  coalition. However, the amount of resources that would be necessary to induce 
  large developing countries to join the agreement may be such that some developed 
  countries perceive the economic costs of a climate agreement to be larger than 
  its environmental benefit. In this case, the transfer mechanism would undermine 
  the existence of the leader coalition and would therefore be ineffective. This 
  is why countries in the leader coalition must be strongly committed to co-operation 
  on emission control.</p>
<p>Another general conclusion emerges from the analysis carried out in Carraro 
  and Siniscalco (1993): both the existence of stable coalitions and the possibilities 
  of expanding them depend on the pattern of interdependence among countries. 
  If there is leakage (<i>i.e.</i>, a non-co-operating country expands its emissions 
  when the coalition restricts them, thus offsetting the effort of the co-operating 
  countries), then environmental benefits from co-operation are low, the incentive 
  to free-ride is high, and conditions for economic and technological transfers 
  to be effective are unlikely to be met. If, on the contrary, there is no leakage 
  (<i>i.e.</i>, the free-riders simply enjoy the cleaner environment without paying for 
  it, but do not offset the emission reduction by the co-operating countries), 
  then environmental benefits are larger, free-riding is less profitable, and 
  transfers may achieve their goal to expand the coalition.</p>
<p>A second policy strategy aimed at expanding the number of signatories to a 
  climate agreement is based on the idea of designing a negotiation mechanism 
  in which countries do not bargain only on GHG reductions, but also on another 
  interrelated (economic) issue. For example, Barrett (1995, 1997c) and Kirchg&auml;ssner 
  and Mohr (1996) propose to link climate negotiations to negotiations on trade 
  liberalization, Carraro and Siniscalco (1995, 1997) and Katsoulacos (1997) propose 
  to link them to negotiations on R&amp;D co-operation, and Mohr (1995) proposes 
  a link to international debt.</p>
<p>Again we must distinguish the profitability from the stability problem. The 
  idea of &#147;issue linkage&#148; was originally proposed by Folmer <i>et al</i>. 
  (1993) and Cesar and De Zeeuw (1996) to solve the problem of asymmetries among 
  countries. The intuition is that some countries gain on a given issue, whereas 
  other countries gain on a second one. By &#147;linking&#148; the two issues 
  it may be possible that the agreement in which the countries decide to co-operate 
  on both issues is profitable to all of them. The idea of &#147;issue linkage&#148; 
  can also be used to achieve the stability goal. If countries that do not sign 
  a climate agreement do not enjoy the benefits that arise from signing simultaneously 
  other multilateral agreements (e.g., those on technological co-operation), then 
  incentive for all countries to sign the linked agreement is strong.</p>
<p>This approach is likely to function when the negotiation on an issue with excludable 
  benefits (a &#147;club good&#148; in economic words) is linked to the climate 
  negotiation (which, if successful, typically provides a public good, that is 
  a non-excludable benefit). An example could be the linkage of environmental 
  negotiations with negotiations on technological co-operation whose benefits 
  are largely shared among the signatories whenever innovation spillovers to non-signatories 
  are low (see Carraro and Siniscalco, 1997)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#14","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>14</sup></small></a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, issue linkage may be a powerful tool to address the enlargement 
  issue. If the developed countries (USA, EU, and Japan above all) increase their 
  financial and technological support to developing countries, and also make this 
  support conditional on the achievement of given environmental targets, then 
  other countries are likely to be induced to join the environmental coalition 
  (<i>i.e.</i>, to sign a treaty in which they commit themselves to adequate emission 
  reductions)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#15","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>15</sup></small></a>.</p>
<p>(d) The final question concerns the link between equity<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#16","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>16</sup></small></a> 
  and the size of a climate agreement and, as a consequence, between equity and 
  the agreement&#146;s environmental effectiveness. It has been shown that the 
  use of different criteria to share the cost of a given emission target crucially 
  affects the size of the equilibrium coalitions, that is the number and identity 
  of signatory countries (Barrett, 1997a; Botteon and Carraro, 1997a, 1997b; Eyckmans, 
  2000). For the Kyoto Protocol, Convery (1999) argues that without assigning 
  generous emission targets to Russia and Ukraine, these countries would not have 
  signed the agreement. Eyckmans (2000) proves the same conclusion by simulating 
  different equilibrium climate coalitions with the Regional Integrated Model 
  of Climate and the Economy (RICE). Indeed, without implementing the Kyoto mechanisms, 
  Russia and Ukraine have an incentive not to ratify the protocol, whereas with 
  joint implementation (JI) and trading, and with the possibility of exchanging 
  excess GHG emissions, all countries find it profitable to ratify the protocol. 
  Bosello <i>et al</i>. (2000), using again the RICE model, confirm the same results 
  and analyze different distributional rules in terms of their impacts on the 
  equilibrium climate coalitions. They show that the Kyoto Protocol could be sustained 
  and possibly expanded by adopting a more equitable sharing of the emission reduction 
  commitments.</p>
