<h3>9.4.2 The Role of Assumptions<br>
</h3>
<h4>9.4.2.1 Baseline</h4>
<p>A critical point for the results of any modelling is the definition of the 
  baseline (or reference or business-as-usual) scenario. The SRES (Nakicenovic 
  <i><i>et al</i></i>., 2000) explores multiple scenarios using six models and identifies 40 
  scenarios divided into 6 scenario groups. As OECD (1998) points out, among the 
  key factors and assumptions underlying reference scenarios are:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>population and productivity growth rates;</li>
  <li>(autonomous) improvements in energy efficiency;</li>
  <li>adoption of regulations e.g., those requiring improvements in air quality; 
    if air quality is assumed to be satisfactory in the baseline, then the potential 
    for air quality ancillary benefits in any GHG mitigation scenario is ruled 
    out by assumption;</li>
  <li>developments in the relative price of fossil fuels; some of the underlying 
    factors are supply-side issues, for example oil and gas reserves, development 
    of gas distribution networks, the relative abundance of coal; energy policies 
    also play a role, particularly tax and subsidy policies;</li>
  <li>technological change, such as the spread of combined cycle gas turbines;</li>
  <li>supply of non-fossil fuel based electricity generation (nuclear and hydro); 
    and</li>
  <li>the availability of competitively priced new sources of energy, so-called 
    backstop fuels, for example solar, wind, biomass, tar sands.</li>
</ul>
<p>Differences in the reference scenarios lead to differences in the effects of 
  mitigation policies. Most notably, a reference scenario with a high growth in 
  GHG emissions implies that all the mitigation scenarios associated with that 
  reference case may require much stronger policies to achieve stabilization.<br>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even if reference scenarios were exactly the same, there are 
  other reasons for changes in model results. Model specification and, more importantly, 
  differences in model parameters also play a significant role in determining 
  the results. <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="9422"></a>9.4.2.2 Costs and Availability of Technology<br>
</h4>
<p>If any fuel becomes perfectly elastic in supply at a given price (i.e., the 
  backstop technology), the overall price of energy will be determined independently 
  of the level of demand, which will then become the critical determinant of mitigation 
  costs. Hence, the assumption of a backstop technology strongly determines mitigation 
  costs. Models without a backstop technology will tend to estimate higher economic 
  impacts of a carbon tax, because they rely completely on conventional fuels, 
  so that the tax rate has to rise indefinitely to keep carbon concentrations 
  constant, to offset the effects of economic growth.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="9423"></a>9.4.2.3 Endogenous Technological Change</h4>
<p>The treatment of technology change is crucial in the macroeconomic modelling 
  of mitigation. The usual means of incorporating technical progress in CGE models 
  is through the use of time trends, as exogenous variables constant across sectors 
  and over time. These trends give the date of the solution. Technical progress 
  usually enters the models via two parameters: (i) autonomous energy efficiency 
  (AEEI) (if technical progress produces savings of energy, then the value share 
  of energy of total costs will be reduced); and (ii) as changes in total factor 
  productivity. The implication of this treatment is that technological progress 
  in the models is assumed to be invariant to the mitigation policies being considered. 
  If in fact the policies lead to improvements in technology, then the costs may 
  be lower then the models suggest. <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="9424"></a>9.4.2.4 Price Elasticity</h4>
<p>In assessing the effects of mitigation, estimations of price-induced substitution 
  possibilities between fuels and between aggregate energy and other inputs can 
  be crucial for model outcomes. All such substitutions become greater as the 
  time for adjustment increases. The problem is that estimates of substitution 
  elasticities are usually highly sensitive to model specification and choice 
  of sample period. There is little agreement on the order of magnitude of some 
  of the substitution elasticities, or even whether they should be positive or 
  negative, e.g., there is debate whether capital and energy are complements or 
  substitutes. If energy and capital are complements, then increasing the price 
  of energy will reduce the demand in production for both energy and capital, 
  reducing both investment and growth. Most CGE models consider very different 
  possibilities of substitution, for example WW, Global 2100, and Nordhaus&#146;s 
  DICE/RICE models assume capital and labour as substitutes, while GREEN assumes 
  capital and energy as direct substitutes.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="9425"></a>9.4.2.5 Degree of Aggregation</h4>
<p>There are many different products, skills, equipment, and production processes; 
  many important features are missed when they are necessarily lumped into composite 
  variables and functions. A basic difference among models and their results is 
  the level of aggregation. Indeed, in practice, different goods have different 
  energy requirements in production, and therefore any changes in consumption 
  and production patterns will affect them differently. Hence, a highly aggregated 
  model will miss some potentially major interactions between output and energy 
  use, which is precisely the purpose of the analysis. For example, sectoral disaggregation 
  allows the modelling of a shift towards less energy-intensive sectors, which 
  might reduce the share of energy in total inputs. In the same way, when a carbon 
  tax is introduced, it could reduce the estimated costs of abatement by allowing 
  substitution effects of energy-intensive goods by less energy-intensive goods.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="9426"></a>9.4.2.6 Treatment of Returns to Scale</h4>
<p>Constant returns to scale represent a common assumption on the economic modelling 
  of climate change. However, in practice, economies of scale seem to be the rule 
  rather than the exception. Indeed, there are several reasons for economies of 
  scale, see Pratten (1988), and Buchanan and Yoon (1994). For example, many electricity-generating 
  stations benefit from economies of scale, utilizing a common pool of resources 
  including fuel supply, equipment maintenance, voltage transformers, and connection 
  to the grid. In spite of this fact, the impact of the effects of increasing 
  returns and imperfect competition (IC) in the modelling of climate-change strategies 
  has consistently been neglected in the literature. Most of the global models, 
  if not all, assume explicitly perfect competition, for example, see DICE/RICE, 
  G-Cubed, Global 2100, GREEN, GTEM, WorldScan, and WW.<br>
