<h1>5 Barriers, Opportunities, and Market Potential of Technologies and Practices</h1>
<h2><a name="51"></a>5.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>The transfer of technologies and practices that have the potential to reduce 
  GHG emissions is often hampered by barriers<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#12","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>12</a></sup></small> 
  that slow their penetration. The opportunity<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#13","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>13</a></sup></small> 
  to mitigate GHG concentrations by removing or modifying barriers to or otherwise 
  accelerating the spread of technology may be viewed within a framework of different 
  potentials for GHG mitigation (<a href="027.htm#figTS7">Figure TS.7</a>). Starting 
  at the bottom, one can imagine addressing barriers (often referred to as market 
  failures) that relate to markets, public policies, and other institutions that 
  inhibit the diffusion of technologies that are (or are projected to be) cost-effective 
  for users without reference to any GHG benefits they may generate. Amelioration 
  of this class of &#147;market and institutional imperfections&#148; would increase 
  GHG mitigation towards the level that is labelled as the &#147;economic potential&#148;. 
  The economic potential represents the level of GHG mitigation that could be 
  achieved if all technologies that are cost-effective from the consumers&#146; 
  point of view were implemented. Because economic potential is evaluated from 
  the consumer&#146;s point of view, we would evaluate cost-effectiveness using 
  market prices and the private rate of time discounting, and also take into account 
  consumers&#146; preferences regarding the acceptability of the technologies&#146; 
  performance characteristics.</p>
<p>Of course, elimination of all these market and institutional barriers would 
  not produce technology diffusion at the level of the &#147;technical potential&#148;. 
  The remaining barriers, which define the gap between economic potential and 
  technical potential, are usefully placed in two groups separated by a socio-economic 
  potential. The first group consists of barriers derived from people&#146;s preferences 
  and other social and cultural barriers to the diffusion of new technology. That 
  is, even if market and institutional barriers are removed, some GHG-mitigating 
  technologies may not be widely used simply because people do not like them, 
  are too poor to afford them, or because existing social and cultural forces 
  operate against their acceptance. If, in addition to overcoming market and institutional 
  barriers, this second group of barriers could be overcome, what is labelled 
  as the &#147;socio-economic potential&#148; would be achieved. Thus, the socio-economic 
  potential represents the level of GHG mitigation that would be approached by 
  overcoming social and cultural obstacles to the use of technologies that are 
  cost-effective.</p>
<p>Finally, even if all market, institutional, social, and cultural barriers were 
  removed, some technologies might not be widely used simply because they are 
  too expensive. Elimination of this requirement would therefore take us up to 
  the level of &#147;technological potential&#148;, the maximum technologically 
  feasible extent of GHG mitigation through technology diffusion.</p>
<p>An issue arises as to how to treat the relative environmental costs of different 
  technologies within this framework. Because the purpose of the exercise is ultimately 
  to identify opportunities for global climate change policies, the technology 
  potentials are defined without regard to GHG impacts. Costs and benefits associated 
  with other environmental impacts would be part of the cost-effectiveness calculation 
  underlying economic potential only insofar as existing environmental regulations 
  or policies internalize these effects and thereby impose them on consumers. 
  Broader impacts might be ignored by consumers, and hence not enter into the 
  determination of economic potential, but they would be incorporated into a social 
  cost-effectiveness calculation. Thus, to the extent that other environmental 
  benefits make certain technologies socially cost-effective, even if they are 
  not cost-effective from a consumer&#146;s point of view, the GHG benefits of 
  diffusion of such technologies would be incorporated in the socio-economic potential.</p>
