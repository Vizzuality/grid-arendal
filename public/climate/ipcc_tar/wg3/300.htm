<h3>7.4.3 Valuation of Spillover Costs and Benefits </h3>
<p>In a world in which countries are linked by international trade, capital flows, 
  and technology transfers GHG abatement by one country has welfare effects on 
  others. In some cases these impacts, or spillovers, are positive and in others 
  negative. Spillovers are a broad concept that has been used in relation to a 
  number of different international inter-linkages between GHG emission reduction 
  policies and impacts on industrial competitiveness, reallocation of industry, 
  and a development and implementation of technologies. This section provides 
  a short introduction to these main categories of spillovers as an introduction 
  to <a href="319.htm">Chapters 8</a> and <a href="353.htm">9</a> that include 
  a review of economy-wide and sectoral studies on spillovers.</p>
<h4><a name="7431"></a>7.4.3.1 Industrial Competitiveness and Potential Reallocation 
  of Industries</h4>
<p>GHG emission reduction policies potentially will have a major impact on industrial 
  competitiveness because sub-sectors that have relatively high GHG emission intensity 
  or have relatively high reduction costs potentially can lose in competitive-ness.<br>
  <br>
  The basic theoretical framework is that of a full employment, open economy, 
  and no international capital mobility (Dixit and Norman, 1984). Within this 
  model an emissions constraint shifts the production possibility frontier inwards, 
  as long as the constraint requires some &#147;no regret&#148; measures to be 
  undertaken. The spillover impact of this shift depends on whether the emissions 
  reductions have a greater impact on the production of the export good, or on 
  the import competing good. If it is the former, abatements turn the terms of 
  trade in favour of the country that undertakes abatement and against the country 
  that does not. In these circumstances the non-abating country suffers some welfare 
  loss, while the abating country could be better or worse off, depending on the 
  size of the shift in terms of trade relative to costs of abatement. Conversely, 
  if emissions have a greater impact on the production of the import-competing 
  good, the terms of trade move in favour of the non-abating country, which should 
  have an increase in welfare. The analysis of industrial reallocation considered 
  in the previous section becomes further complicated when international capital 
  mobility is taken into account. Carbon constraints typically alter relative 
  rates of return against abating and in favour of non-abating countries. A flow 
  from the former to the latter is then likely, which shifts further inwards the 
  production possibility frontier in the abating country. At the same time, it 
  causes an outwards shift of the frontier in the non-abating country. Modelling 
  capital flows is notoriously difficult, however, and no theoretical results 
  can be obtained for the complex and empirically relevant cases. Hence the indisputable 
  need to use simulation models and to undertake primary empirical research. The 
  welfare impacts of changes in international capital flows are seldom reported. 
  Progress depends on the further development of techniques such as decomposition 
  analysis (Huff and Hertel, 1996)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#18","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>18</sup></small></a> 
  and multiple simulations in which some variables are held constant to isolate 
  their influence on the final outcome.<br>
  <br>
  Seen from a more practical perspective the theoretical arguments about competitiveness 
  and international capital flows have at least two versions of what happens without 
  specific developing country targets: either domestic industry relocates abroad, 
  or the demand for domestic energy-intensive goods declines and the trade balance 
  deteriorates; or both occur. </p>
<p>Consider four factors that affect location or trade effects. First, do the 
  non-tradable sectors account for a substantial share of carbon emissions? Second, 
  are energy costs a small or large percentage of the total costs in key manufacturing 
  sectors? Third, is the burden of meeting an emission reduction target partially 
  borne by non-participating countries because of changes mediated through international 
  trade? For example, developed nations could demand fewer exports from non-participating 
  countries. This would shift the terms of trade against these countries, and 
  they would bear some of the costs of reducing GHGs. Fourth, how do resources 
  shift across sectors because of carbon policy? For instance, there could be 
  a shift from the energy-intensive sector to the domestic goods sector that is 
  non-energy intensive. The aggregate impact could be positive or negative depending 
  on the potential returns from the non-energy intensive sector. </p>
<p>First, consider the &#147;pollution havens&#148; hypothesis, in which firms 
  are tempted to relocate to or to build new plants in nations with lax environmental 
  standards (see Dean, 1992; Summers, 1992; Esty, 1994; Jaffe <i>et al</i>., 1994). 
  Palmer <i>et al</i>. (1995) point out that the following must be considered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>whether the cost of complying with environmental regulation is a small fraction 
    of total cost;<br>
  </li>
  <li>whether the differences between the developed nation&#146;s environmental 
    regulations and those of most major trading partners are small or large; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>whether the firms of the developed nation build state-of-the art facilities 
    abroad regardless of the host nation&#146;s environmental regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The evidence to date on pollution havens is not strong, although this may change 
  in the future as international agreements on climate change come into force. 
</p>
<p>In the context of climate change, cost estimates must consider how carbon taxes 
  affect trade flows in the short and long runs. The &#147;leakage effect&#148; 
  reflects the extent to which cuts in domestic emissions are offset by shifts 
  in production and therefore increases in emissions abroad. The empirical question 
  is whether nations that are a net exporter in fossil fuel intensive products 
  (e.g., steel) gain under Annex I-only carbon policies. Other developing nations 
  might not gain because less capital will be available as the income in the developed 
  nations drops, and it becomes more costly to import from developed nations the 
  capital goods that promote growth (e.g., machinery and transportation equipment). 
  See <a href="319.htm">Chapters 8</a> and <a href="353.htm">9</a> for any empirical 
  evidence on the magnitude of leakage.<br>
