<h3><a name="143"></a>1.4.3 Decoupling Wellbeing from Production</h3>
<p>Creating an improved, or at least a different, way of life supported by a given 
  set of natural inputs could also enhance the overall resource productivity in 
  society. For developed countries (and the corresponding social sections in developing 
  countries) pursuing such an objective might start from the insight offered by 
  some research that there is no clear link between level of GNP and quality of 
  life (or satisfaction) beyond certain thresholds. Linton (1998) and UNDP (1998) 
  draw this distinction clearly. Both sources argue that the quality of life is 
  determined by subjective and non-subjective variables. On the subjective side, 
  quality of life depends upon personal satisfaction, which in part depends on 
  shared preferences and institutional values. On the non-subjective side, it 
  depends upon opportunity structures, which may include access to nature, participation 
  in community, availability of non-market goods, or public wealth, in addition 
  to purchasing power. This literature describes situations in which GNP growth 
  continues without a corresponding increase in human welfare as &#147;overdevelopment&#148; 
  or &#147;uneconomic growth&#148; (Daly, 1997). For developing countries, however, 
  the research suggests that this decoupling perspective may start from the insight 
  that non-monetary assets (in terms of natural resources, just as in terms of 
  community networks) need to be protected and enhanced to improve the livelihoods 
  of the poorer and less powerful sections of society. Structures, patterns, and 
  rates of economic growth may have to be shaped in such a way that these non-monetary 
  assets are not diminished, but increased. </p>
<p>On both monetary and non-monetary accounts, a decoupling transition to sustainability 
  implies a twin-track strategy. It may be achieved through both an intelligent 
  reinvention of means (&#147;efficiency&#148;) and a prudent moderation of ends 
  (&#147;sufficiency&#148;; Meadows et al., 1992; Sachs et al., 1998) for the 
  sake of both environmental and social sustainability. With regard to the environment, 
  efficiency-centred strategies can have a limit; they can fail to account for 
  the effects of continuing growth (Ayres, 1998). For instance, higher per-unit 
  fuel efficiency of cars may not reduce total gasoline consumption in the long 
  run if growth effects in terms of number, power, and size of cars cancel efficiency 
  gains (see <a href="089.htm">Chapter 3</a>; Pinguelli Rosa and Tolmasquin, 
  1993).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#26","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>26</sup></small></a> 
  With regard to social justice, resource consumption on the part of the rich 
  has been shown, at times, to undermine the environmental sources of livelihood 
  for the poor. Frequently discussed examples are the construction of large dams 
  for urban electricity supply, which displace large numbers of subsistence peasants, 
  or deforestation for industrial purposes, which marginalizes indigenous people 
  living in and from the forest. In contrast to literature that postulates a &#147;trickling-down 
  effect&#148; in the long term, this school of thought is concerned about the 
  social cost in the present. For its proponents, to secure the rights of the 
  most vulnerable would, in many cases, imply moderation of resource extraction 
  in terms of absolute volumes (Gadgil and Guha, 1995). In the light of these 
  reasons, social and technological systems that combine both high eco-efficiency 
  and intermediate performance levels may be the most likely to foster human welfare 
  at a lower cost to the environment and to social justice. </p>
<p>Four dimensions&#150;intermediate performance levels, regionalization, &#147;appropriate&#148; 
  lifestyles, and community resource rights&#150;can be distinguished in the relevant 
  literature. Policy options identified along these four dimensions emerge from 
  a broader concept of climate mitigation than is typically captured in the energy 
  supply and demand technologies represented in existing energy&#150;economic 
  models. Each option has great potential to reduce GHG emissions, but each needs 
  to be evaluated carefully in terms of its impacts on economic, social, and biological 
  systems. This sort of evaluation of opportunity cost has not, however, been 
  reported in the literature under review. Moreover, most authors are ready to 
  admit that the conditions of public acceptance of such options are not often 
  present at the requisite large scale; they emphasize, however, the necessity 
  to explore these options in order to foster long-term social learning processes. 
  Regional views on the need for or feasibility of decoupling wellbeing from production 
  vary widely. This subsection closes with a brief review of each dimension noted 
  here.</p>
<h4><a name="1431"></a>1.4.3.1 Intermediate Performance Levels</h4>
<p>Most of the literature on resource-efficient technologies takes for granted 
  that performance levels will (and should) increase. For the sake of a broader 
  portfolio of options, however, some analysts question this assumption. It is 
  suggested that to create resource-light economies could imply deliberately designing 
  technologies (e.g., in construction, ventilation, refrigeration, vehicles, crop 
  cultivation, energy delivery systems) with levels of performance that lie below 
  the maximum feasible. These technologies are often more labour intensive. For 
  instance, the higher speed in transportation are (efficiency gains notwithstanding) 
  unlikely to be environmentally sustainable in the long run; moreover, it is 
  doubtful that this trend really enhances the quality of life (Hirsch, 1976; 
  Wachtel, 1994). Designing cars and trains with lower top speeds could give rise 
  to a new generation of moderately motorized vehicles with much lower resource 
  requirements. In general, renewable energy sources and locally adapted materials, 
  it is argued, become more competitive when the performance expectations on the 
  demand side are reduced (Meyer-Abich, 1997). Sails still drive much of ship 
  traffic in parts of the world, as on the Niger and Nile, or the great rivers 
  of China. And bicycles carry a substantial portion of traffic in many regions 
  of the world. Indeed, biomass of all kinds (wood for construction and fuel, 
  plant and animal food and fibre, medicines, dyes, etc.) has been the renewable 
  resource base for humankind since time immemorial. However, to successfully 
  upgrade non-carbon-based technologies, the performance level desired seems to 
  be a critical factor for them to be technically and economically viable. </p>
<h4><a name="1432"></a>1.4.3.2 Regionalization</h4>
<p>Production and lifestyles based on high volumes of long-distance transportation 
  carry a relatively high load of energy and raw materials. Some researchers argue 
  (Shuman, 1998; Magnaghi, 2000) that a low-input society may require that the 
  economy evolves in a plurality of spaces, in which markets that work with &#147;regional 
  sourcing&#148; and &#147;regional marketing&#148; can co-exist with markets 
  that focus on &#147;global sourcing&#148; and &#147;global marketing&#148;. 
  Avoiding demand for transport rather than just optimizing the modal split between 
  private and public means of transport is often considered the objective of sustainable 
  policies (Whitelegg, 1993), and regionalized economies may be best suited to 
  this objective. Moreover, solar power, which relies on the widespread but diffuse 
  resource of sunlight, may be best developed when many operators harvest small 
  amounts of energy, transforming and consuming the resource at close distance. 
  A similar logic holds for biomass-centred technologies. Plant matter is widespread, 
  available, and heavy in weight; it may be best obtained and processed in a decentralized 
  fashion. For this reason, some analysts argue that a resource-light economy 
  has to be, in part, a regionalized economy. On the other hand, <a href="068.htm">Chapter 
  2</a> points out that regionalization may impede technology transfer, leading 
  to higher emissions, other things being equal.</p>
<h4><a name="1433"></a>1.4.3.3 &#147;Appropriate&#148; Lifestyles</h4>
<p>Many authors question whether the accumulation of individually owned goods 
  beyond a certain threshold continues to increase wellbeing at the same rate. 
  They suggest that individuals and families could be capable of enhancing their 
  personal resource productivity&#150;a goal which, in turn, could be defined 
  as the ability to maintain and/or increase satisfaction with lower and/or intermediate 
  input of resources. Some authors consider intervention in the prevailing narrative 
  of consumption&#150;&#147;more (consumption) is better&#148;&#150;a possible 
  strategy to interrupt the satisfaction&#150;consumption cycle (Common, 1995; 
  Lichtenberg, 1996; Schor, 1998). These approaches draw their motivation from 
  the hypothesis that, ecologically, it is not only the pattern, but also the 
  overall scale of consumption that matters. If this is correct, then social capital 
  in its broadest sense might have to substitute for increased absolute volumes 
  of consumption (Robinson and Herbert, 2000). <a href="179.htm">Chapters 5</a> 
  and <a href="379.htm">10</a> elaborate on the role of lifestyles as a barrier 
  to climate change mitigation, but also as a potential opportunity. </p>
<p>On one level, most resource-intensive consumer goods, in effect, used for only 
  a fraction of time because they are individually owned. Intensity of use could 
  be increased<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#27","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>27</sup></small></a> 
  through schemes that involve co-ownership, renting, or leasing (Zukunftskommission, 
  1998). On another level, the marginal utility of more free time increases faster 
  than the marginal utility of more purchasing power for the more affluent parts 
  of society (Schor, 1998). Choosing more wealth in time rather than more wealth 
  in goods and services can be seen as a viable option, which promises to increase 
  freedom while containing consumption levels. Finally, under conditions of &#147;reflexive 
  modernization&#148; (Beck, 1991), consumption styles might emerge that put more 
  emphasis on quality and non-material satisfaction rather than on rising volumes 
  of consumption (Durning, 1992). As consumption activities become reinserted 
  into the broader contexts of human wellbeing, diverse balances may be found 
  between satisfaction derived from the marketplace and satisfaction derived from 
  non-monetary assets (Reisch and Scherhorn, 1999).</p>
<h4><a name="1434"></a>1.4.3.4 Community Resource Rights</h4>
<p>One-third of mankind derives its sustenance directly from nature (UNDP, 1998, 
  p. 80); and these people live, for the most part, in ecologically fragile areas. 
  Environmental resources are valued as a source of livelihood by groups as diverse 
  as the fisherfolk of Kerala, the forest dwellers of the Amazon, the herders 
  of Tanzania, and the peasants of Mexico (Ghai and Vivian, 1992). In such cases, 
  households rely on non-market goods and natural habitats for important inputs 
  into the production system (Cavendish, 1996). Many of these communities, over 
  the centuries, developed complex and ingenious systems of institutions and rules 
  to regulate ownership and use of natural resources in such a way that an equilibrium 
  between resource extraction and resource preservation could be achieved. However, 
  particularly under the pressure of the resource needs brought forth by individuals 
  with relatively high energy consumption, the basis of their livelihood has been 
  undermined, degrading their dignity and sending many of them into misery (Kates, 
  2000). Under these circumstances, sustainable development may mean, in the first 
  place, ensuring the rights of communities over their own resources. Properly 
  arranged, and in concert with competitive markets and astute institutional arrangements, 
  resource rights could make investment consistent with community values and associated 
  positive effects on climate change mitigation. Use of ecologically sustainable 
  resources can be made a matter of self-interest. Well-designed resource-right 
  mechanisms permit resource users to use new information and new technology and 
  pursue new market opportunities. Resource use by outsiders becomes a matter 
  of negotiation or trading on more equal terms, which protects the economic security 
  of the communities involved. Better access to resources could offer new opportunities 
  to increase the productivity of all components of the village ecosystem&#150;from 
  grazing and forestlands to croplands, water systems, and animals. This may, 
  in turn, enhance people&#146;s wellbeing, which in these circumstances depends 
  on increasing and regenerating biomass in an equitable and sustainable manner. 
  It is well known from the economics literature that the management of common 
  property resources seems to work best when group members can draw on trust and 
  reciprocity, have some autonomy to make their own rules, and perceive to gain 
  benefits from their efforts (Ostrom <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>To summarize, we have examined three different perspectives 
that approach climate change mitigation from different vantage points&#150;cost-effectiveness, 
equity, and sustainability&#150;but converge in terms of the comprehensive set 
of goals to be pursued. However, the three perspectives use different analytical 
tools and causal relationships, and often provide different policy guidance. The 
main message of this chapter is that these three perspectives are complementary 
in nature, and can be helpful for the policymaker if used in conjunction. However, 
this does raise the issue of how to choose between various policy options and 
how to prioritize actions in the face of possibly divergent advice.</p>
