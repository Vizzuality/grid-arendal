<h2>3.2 Drivers of Technological Change and Innovation</h2>
<p>Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is highly dependent upon both technological 
  innovation and practices. The rate of introduction of new technologies, and 
  the drivers for adoption are, however, different in industrial market economies, 
  economies in transition and developing countries.</p>
<p>In industrial countries, technologies are developed as a result of corporate 
  innovation or government-supported R&amp;D, and in response to environmental 
  regulations, energy tax policies, or other incentives. The shift of electric 
  and gas utilities from regulated monopolies to competing enterprises has also 
  played a major role in the strong shift to combined cycle gas turbines, often 
  with utilization of the waste heat in the electric power sector.</p>

<p>The most rapid growth in the electric power sector and many energy intensive 
  industries is now occurring in developing countries, which have come to rely 
  heavily upon technology transfer for investments in energy infrastructure. Capital 
  for investment flows from industrial countries to developing countries through 
  several pathways such as multilateral and bilateral official development assistance 
  (ODA), foreign direct investments (FDI), commercial sales, and commercial and 
  development bank lending. During the period 1993 to 1997, ODA experienced a 
  downward trend with an increase in 1998, while FDI has increased substantially 
  by a factor of five (see <a href="#fig33">Figure 3.3</a>) (OECD, 1999; Metz 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000). This shift is a consequence of the many opportunities that have 
  opened for private capital in developing countries, and a reluctance by some 
  industrial countries to increase ODA. The energy supply sector of developing 
  countries is also undergoing deregulation from state to private ownership, increasing 
  the role of the private sector in technology innovation. </p>
<p>A large percentage of capital is invested in a relatively small number of technologies 
  that are responsible for a significant share of the energy supply and consumption 
  market (automobiles, electric power generators, and building heating and cooling 
  systems). There is a tendency to optimize these few technologies and their related 
  infrastructure development, gaining them advantages that will make it more difficult 
  for subsequent competing technologies to catch up. For example, a particular 
  technological configuration such as road-based automobiles can become &#147;locked-in&#148; 
  as the dominant transportation mode. This occurs because evolution of technological 
  systems is as important as the evolution of individual new technologies. As 
  their use expands their development becomes intertwined with the evolution of 
  many other technologies and institutional and social developments. The evolution 
  of technologies for oil exploration and extraction and for automobile production 
  both affect and are affected by the expansion of infrastructures such as efficient 
  refineries and road networks. They also affect and are affected by social and 
  institutional developments, such as political and military power and settlement 
  patterns, and business adaptation to changed transportation options, respectively.</p>
<p>Lock-in effects have two implications. First, early investments and early applications 
  are extremely important in determining which technologies will be most important 
  in the future. Second, learning and lock-in make technology transfer more difficult. 
  Learning is much more dependent on successful building and using technology 
  than on instruction manuals. Furthermore, technological productivity is strongly 
  dependent upon complementary networks of suppliers, repair persons and training 
  which is difficult to replicate in another country or region (IIASA/WEC, 1998; 
  Unruh, 1999, 2000).</p>
<p>There are multiple government-driven pathways for technological innovation 
  and change. Through regulation of energy markets, environmental regulations, 
  energy efficiency standards, and market-based initiatives such as energy and 
  emission taxes, governments can induce technology changes and influence the 
  level of innovations. Important examples of government policies on energy supply 
  include the Clean Air Act in the USA, the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation in the 
  UK, the Feed-in-Law in Germany, the Alcohol Transport Fuel Program in Brazil, 
  and utility deregulation that began in the UK and has now moved to the USA, 
  Norway, Argentina, and many other countries. Voluntary agreements or initiatives 
  implemented by the manufacturing industry, including energy supply sections, 
  can also be drivers of technological change and innovation.</p>
<p>In the energy-consuming sector, major government actions can promote energy 
  efficient use and the replacement of high (like coal) to lower carbon fuels 
  (like natural gas and renewables). Energy efficiency standards for vehicles, 
  appliances, heating and cooling systems, and buildings can also substantially 
  encourage the adoption of new technologies. On the other hand, continued subsidies 
  for coal and electricity, and a failure to properly meter electricity and gas 
  are substantial disincentives to energy efficiency gains and the uptake of renewable 
  and low carbon technologies. Government-supported R&amp;D has also played a 
  significant role in developing nuclear power, low carbon technologies such as 
  gas turbines, and carbon-free energy sources including wind, solar, and other 
  renewables. Such government actions in the energy-consuming sector can ensure 
  increasing access to energy required for sustainable development.</p>
<p>While regulation in national energy markets is well established, it is unclear 
  how international efforts at GHG emission regulation may be applied at the global 
  level. The Kyoto Protocol and its mechanisms represent opportunities to bring 
  much needed energy-efficient practices and alternative energy to the continuously 
  growing market of developing countries and in reshaping the energy markets of 
  the economies in transition.</p>
<p>Important dimensions and drivers for the successful transfer of lower GHG technologies 
  to developing countries and economies in transition are capacity building, an 
  enabling environment, and adequate mechanisms for technology transfer (Metz 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000). Markets for the use of new forms of energy are often non-existent 
  or very small, and require collaboration among the local government and commercial 
  or multilateral lending banks to promote procurement. It may also be necessary 
  to utilize temporary subsidies and market-based incentives as well. Because 
  energy is such a critical driver of development, it is essential that strategies 
  to reduce GHG emissions be consistent with development goals. This is true for 
  all economies, but is especially true for developing countries and economies 
  in transition where leap-frogging to modern, low emitting, highly efficient 
  technologies is critical (Moomaw <i>et al</i>., 1999a; Goldemberg, 1998).</p>
<p>Non-energy benefits are an important driver of technological change and innovation 
  (Mills and Rosenfeld, 1996; Pye and McKane, 2000). Certain energy-efficient, 
  renewable, and distributed energy options offer non-energy benefits. One class 
  of such benefits accrues at the national level, e.g. via improved competitiveness, 
  energy security, job creation, environmental protection, while another relates 
  to consumers and their decision-making processes. From a consumer perspective, 
  it is often the non-energy benefits that motivate decisions to adopt such technologies. 
  Consumer benefits from energy-efficient technologies can be grouped into the 
  following categories: (1) improved indoor environment, comfort, health, safety, 
  and productivity; (2) reduced noise; (3) labour and time savings; (4) improved 
  process control; (5) increased reliability, amenity or convenience; (6) water 
  savings and waste minimization; and (7) direct and indirect economic benefits 
  from downsizing or elimination of equipment. Such benefits have been observed 
  in all end-use sectors. For renewable and distributed energy technologies, the 
  non-energy benefits stem primarily from reduced risk of business interruption 
  during and after natural disasters, grid system failures or other adverse events 
  in the electric power grid (Deering and Thornton, 1998).</p>
<p>Product manufacturers often emphasize non-energy benefits as a driver in their 
  markets, e.g. the noise- and UV-reduction benefits of multi-glazed window systems 
  or the disaster-recovery benefits of stand-alone photovoltaic technologies. 
  Of particular interest are attributes of energy-efficient and renewable energy 
  technologies and practices that reduce insurance risks (Mills and Rosenfeld, 
  1996). Approximately 80 specific examples have been identified with applications 
  in the buildings and industrial sectors (Vine <i>et al</i>., 1998), and insurers have 
  begun to promote these in the buildings sector (Mills, 1999). The insurance 
  sector has also supported transportation energy efficiency improvements that 
  increase highway safety (reduced speed limits) and urban air quality (mass transportation) 
  (American Insurance Association, 1999). Insurance industry concern about increased 
  natural disasters caused by global climate change also serves as a motivation 
  for innovative market transformation initiatives on behalf of the industry to 
  support climate change adaptation and mitigation (Mills 1998, 1999; Vellinga 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000; Nutter, 1996). Market benefits for industries that adopt low carbon- 
  emitting processes and products have also been increasingly recognized and documented 
  (Hawken <i>et al</i>., 1999; Romm, 1999).</p>
