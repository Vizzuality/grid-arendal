<h2>7.6 Modelling and Cost Assessment </h2>
<h3><a name="761"></a>7.6.1 Introduction </h3>
<p>The costs of climate policy are assessed by various analytical approaches, 
  each with its own strengths and weaknesses. This section considers first the 
  modelling options currently used to assess the costs of climate policy, and 
  then the key assumptions that influence the range of cost estimates. The focus 
  is on the general conceptual elements of cost assessment and on an evaluation 
  of how model structures and input assumptions affect the range of cost estimates. 
</p>
<h3><a name="762"></a>7.6.2 Classification of Economic Models</h3>
<p>The models presented here are described and discussed in more detail in <a href="319.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>, in which a review of the main literature on these models is presented. 
  However, it is useful to present an overview of the main modelling techniques 
  applied in this kind of analysis here. </p>
<p><i>Input&#150;Output Models</i><br>
  Input&#150;output (IO) models describe the complex interrelationships among 
  economic sectors using sets of simultaneous linear equations. The coefficients 
  of equations are fixed, which means that factor substitution, technological 
  change, and behavioural aspects related to climate change mitigation policies 
  cannot be assessed. IO models take aggregate demand as given and provide considerable 
  sectoral detail on how the demand is met. They are used when the sectoral consequences 
  of mitigation or adaptation actions are of particular interest (Fankhauser and 
  McCoy, 1995). The high level of sectoral disaggregation, however, requires strong 
  restrictions that limit the validity of the model to short runs (5&#150;15 years).<br>
</p>
<p><i>Macroeconomic (Keynesian or Effective Demand) Models<br>
  </i>Macroeconomic models describe investments and consumption patterns in various 
  sectors, and emphasize short-run dynamics associated with GHG emission reduction 
  policies. Final demand remains the principal determinant of the size of the 
  economy. The equilibrating mechanisms work through quantity adjustments, rather 
  than price. Temporary disequilibria that result in underutilization of production 
  capacity, unemployment, and current account imbalances are possible. Many macroeconomic 
  models are available. They implicitly reflect past behaviour in that the driving 
  equations are estimated using econometric techniques on time-series data. As 
  a consequence, macroeconomic models are well suited to consider the economic 
  effects of GHG emission reduction policies in the short- to medium-horizon.</p>
<p><i>Computable General Equilibrium Models</i><br>
  CGE models construct the behaviour of economic agents based on microeconomic 
  principles. The models typically simulate markets for factors of production 
  (e.g., labour, capital, energy), products, and foreign exchange, with equations 
  that specify supply and demand behaviour. The models are solved for a set of 
  wages, prices, and exchange rates to bring all of the markets into equilibrium. 
  CGE models examine the economy in different states of equilibrium and so are 
  not able to provide insight into the adjustment process. The parameters in CGE 
  models are partly calibrated (i.e., they are selected to fit one year of data) 
  and only partly statistically or econometrically determined (i.e., estimated 
  from several years of data). Hence it is difficult to defend the validity of 
  some of the parameter values.</p>
<p><i>Dynamic Energy Optimization Models</i><br>
  Dynamic energy optimization models, a class of energy sector models, can also 
  be termed partial equilibrium models. These technology-oriented models minimize 
  the total costs of the energy system, including all end-use sectors, over a 
  40&#150;50 year horizon and thus compute a partial equilibrium for the energy 
  markets. The costs include investment and operation costs of all sectors based 
  on a detailed representation of factor costs and assumptions about GHG emission 
  taxes. Early versions of these models assessed how energy demands can be met 
  at least cost. Recent versions allow demand to respond to prices. Another development 
  has established a link between aggregate macroeconomic demand and energy demand. 
  Optimization models are useful to assess the dynamic aspects of GHG emissions 
  reduction potential and costs. The rich technology information in the models 
  is helpful to assess capital stock turnover and technology learning, which is 
  endogenous in some models. </p>
<p><i>Integrated Energy-System Simulation Models</i><br>
  Integrated energy-system simulation models are bottom-up models that include 
  a detailed representation of energy demand and supply technologies, which include 
  end-use, conversion, and production technologies. Demand and technology development 
  are driven by exogenous scenario assumptions often linked to technology vintage 
  models and econometric forecasts. The demand sectors are generally disaggregated 
  for industrial subsectors and processes, residential and service categories, 
  transport modes, etc. This allows development trends to be projected through 
  technology development scenarios. The simulation models are best suited for 
  short- to medium-term studies in which the detailed technology information helps 
  explain a major part of energy needs.</p>
<p><i>Partial Forecasting Models</i><br>
  A wide variety of relatively simple techniques are used to forecast energy supply 
  and demand, either for single time periods or with time development and varying 
  degrees of dynamics and feedback. The main content is data on the technical 
  characteristics of the energy system and related financial or direct cost. </p>
<p><i>Limits of Economic Models Taxonomy</i><br>
  The macroeconomic and CGE approaches can be further classified as &#147;top-down&#148; 
  methodologies, while the technology-rich dynamic optimization/partial equilibrium, 
  simulation, and partial forecasting approaches can be considered &#147;bottom-up&#148; 
  approaches. It is also noted that the dynamic optimization/partial equilibrium, 
  simulation, and partial forecasting approaches are sometimes collectively referred 
  to as the family of engineering&#150;economic models.</p>
<p>While useful, this taxonomy has its limits. First, differences in parameter 
  values among the models within a given category may be more significant than 
  the differences in model structure across categories. Second, many differences 
  emerge between the theory underlying a particular model group and the actual 
  models. Third, most models are hybrid constructions linked to provide greater 
  detail on the structure of the economy and the energy sector (Hourcade et al., 
  1998). A hybrid approach sheds light on both the economic and technological 
  aspects of reducing energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but it does have 
  its drawbacks. Consistent results require that a hybrid approach remove all 
  the inconsistencies across the linked models. This process is often cumbersome 
  and time consuming.<br>
