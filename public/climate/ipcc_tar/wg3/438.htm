<h4>10.4.2.3 Institutional Considerations</h4>
<p>In contrast to the single-actor paradigm, which assumes that society can be 
  identified with a unique optimizing decision maker, GHG emissions are, in fact, 
  controlled by a multitude of individual agents and multiple decision makers 
  that influence the transformation of individual to collective actions. Thus 
  far, decision analysis has strongly emphasized the most aggregated level of 
  government policy and neglected the multidimensionality of decision-making institutions 
  (Jaeger <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>Although there are many country-specific differences in the relationships between 
  national, regional, and local governments, most analysts consider local authorities 
  to be the salient political actors. In addition to acting on their own, local 
  governments serve as an interface between citizens and the nation state, and 
  they are in regular contact with members of the community. O&#146;Riordan <i>et al</i>. (1998) suggest that, as the need for more effective climate policy emerges, 
  it might be useful to broaden the national response strategy to incorporate 
  the local levels and so stimulate the very effective informal institutional 
  dynamics of individuals and households. The rise in the number of informal networks 
  of co-operation dispersed via schools, universities, religious communities and 
  other social groups is regarded as an important step towards including climate 
  change awareness into people&#146;s everyday concerns. This is of great importance, 
  as the individual costs of contributing to climate change are less than the 
  consequent social costs, and thus individual agents generate a changing climate 
  that is socially suboptimal. Becoming aware of the gap between individual and 
  social rationality is assumed to stimulate effective mitigation and adapation 
  measures.</p>
<p>Striking the appropriate balance between mitigation and adaptation will be 
  a tedious process. The need for, and extent and costs of adaptation measures 
  in any region will be determined by the magnitude and nature of regional climate 
  change as a local manifestation of global climate change. How global climate 
  change unfolds will be determined by the total amount of GHG emissions that, 
  in turn, reflects nations&#146; willingness to undertake mitigation measures. 
  Toth (unpublished) points out that balancing mitigation and adaptation efforts 
  largely depends on how mitigation costs are related to net damages (primary 
  or gross damage minus damage averted through adaptation plus costs of adaptation). 
  Both mitigation costs and net damages, in turn, depend on some crucial baseline 
  assumptions: economic development and baseline emissions largely determine emission 
  reduction costs, while development and institutions influence adaptive capacity.</p>
<p>Different levels of globally agreed limits for climate change (or for atmospheric 
  GHG concentrations, as frequently discussed), entail different balances of mitigation 
  costs and net damages for individual nations. Considering the uncertainties 
  involved and future learning, climate stabilization will inevitably be an iterative 
  process. Nation states will determine their own national targets based on their 
  own exposure and their sensitivity to other countries&#146; exposure to climate 
  change. The global target emerges from consolidating national targets, possibly 
  involving side payments, in global negotiations. Simultaneously, agreement on 
  burden sharing and the agreed global target determines national costs. Compared 
  to the expected net damages associated with the global target, nation states 
  might reconsider their own national targets, especially as new information becomes 
  available on global and regional patterns and impacts of climate change. This 
  becomes the starting point for the next round of negotiations. It follows from 
  the above that establishing the &#147;magic number&#148; (i.e., the upper limit 
  for global climate change or GHG concentration in the atmosphere) will be a 
  long policy process, hopefully helped by improving science.</p>
<p>Mitigation and adaptation decisions related to anthropogenically induced climate 
  change differ. Mitigation decisions involve many countries, disperse benefits 
  globally over decades to centuries (with some near-term ancillary benefits), 
  are driven by public policy action, based on information available today, and 
  the relevant regulation will require rigorous enforcement. In contrast, adaptation 
  decisions involve a shorter time span between outlays and returns, related costs 
  and benefits accrue locally and their implementation involves local public policies 
  and private adaptation of the affected social agents, both based on improving 
  information. Local mitigation and adaptive capacities vary significantly across 
  regions and over time. A portfolio of mitigation and adaptation policies will 
  depend on local or national priorities and preferred approaches in combination 
  with international responsibilities.</p>
