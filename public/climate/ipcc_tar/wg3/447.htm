<p>The variety of equity principles reflects the diverse expectations of fairness 
  that people use to judge policy processes and the corresponding outcomes. The 
  demand for fairness arises from the existence of communities (social solidarity) 
  and from publicly shared expectations of the conduct of community relations. 
  As communities pursue manifold ways of organizing institutional structures and 
  social relations, there are different perceptions of what is equitable and fair 
  (Rayner et al., 1999; Rayner and Malone, 2000). Distinct moral principles generate 
  conflicting debates on how to share the burdens, even though there might be 
  equally legitimate and justified claims. Therefore, it is very difficult to 
  achieve a worldwide consensus on just one justice principle. One way of reaching 
  an accord might be to set up a combination of the diverse equity-based distribution 
  proposals (M&uuml;ller, 1998). Even if agreement on a particular first principle 
  is reached, the question of how reductions for each country should be generated 
  would remain unresolved because of the different reference bases against which 
  equity cirteria could be applied, such as population, land area, GDP per capita, 
  or emissions per capita. With respect to the spatial distribution of GHG emissions 
  limitation burdens, should the burdens be laid more on the production or on 
  the consumption side of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and what are the accompanying 
  effects in terms of intragenerational equity (Rose and Stevens, 1998)? In summary, 
  manifold equity principles and different accompanying operational rules exist; 
  these might best be applied as a combination to respect more than just one equity 
  position and thus enhance political feasibility.</p>
<p>However, there is a strong bias towards the principle of efficiency and its 
  underlying utilitarian maxim. Also, it is important to recognize that self-interest 
  plays a crucial role in voting for a specific operation rule, and that self-interests 
  or, alternatively, particular preferences are at the core of economic considerations. 
  Closely related to the concept of preferences is that of willingness-to-pay. 
  Developed countries usually have a much higher willingness-to-pay in terms of 
  solving environmental problems. This is partly because willingness-to-pay depends 
  on the ability to pay. Consequently, it seems reasonable that developed countries 
  bear the primary burden involved in mitigating climate change (Victor, 1999), 
  as endorsed in the Kyoto Protocol. Hence, economics in terms of efficiency is 
  a major aspect when negotiating emissions-limitation commitments.</p>
<p>The problem of distributing emissions-limitation quotas is not solved by economic 
  principles either, because emissions trading yields Pareto efficiency irrespective 
  of the initial distribution of emission permits. Where-flexibility in emissions 
  reduction follows Coase (1960), who addresses the assignment of property rights 
  as an efficient solution to market failure. Under the assumptions of perfect 
  competition, a marketable emissions permit scheme with full trading will be 
  cost-effective no matter how the permits are distributed. It will lead to an 
  equalizing of the marginal costs of emissions reduction across all sources (Nordhaus, 
  1994a) and generate the same costs no matter which burden-sharing rule is applied. 
  Hence, there is no efficiency&#150;equity trade-off and no obstacle to considering 
  equity issues within climate change while emphasizing cost-effectiveness. Equity 
  rules play an important role when determining the initial distribution of emissions 
  allowances, or the compensation schemes, as cost-effectiveness might result 
  in a disproportionately high level of burden to certain groups of countries. 
  Attempts can be made to provide resource transfers to compensate for the disadvantaged 
  (Biermann, 1997). Usually, it is assumed that mitigation costs are relatively 
  higher in developed countries. Thus, trading reduces the costs to developed 
  countries and provide a transfer to developing countries. Yet, the magnitude 
  of side payments needs to be considered when evaluating alternative burden-sharing 
  rules, because they often generate rather high transaction and/or administrative 
  costs (Burniaux, 1999). If, however, use of the flexibility mechanisms is restricted 
  and equalization of marginal abatement costs throughout the countries cannot 
  be fulfilled, the choice of burden-sharing rule matters with respect to the 
  aggregate abatement costs. Furthermore, emissions trading is usually perceived 
  to take place in a perfect market with parties having equal opportunities of 
  involvement. Agarwal and Narain (1991) see an advantage for developed nations 
  who have stronger market capacities.</p>
<p>Montgomery (1997) points out that it is not only international negotiators 
  who must consider equity, but also domestic legislators. In an attempt to limit 
  the competitiveness consequences implied by the loss of capital and jobs that 
  may accompany efforts to limit domestic emissions, legislators may act to impose 
  trade barriers. This is another aspect of the need to link international equity 
  and negotiations to the fairness concerns in domestic implementations.</p>
<p>This section shows that equity, opportunities for cost-effectiveness, and flexibility 
  are among the main criteria that a burden sharing rule should satisfy. While 
  it is clear that Pareto optimality is a broadly accepted efficiency principle, 
  there is no agreement on a best equity principle. Therefore theories of justice 
  do not generate one best solution for the international allocation of emissions 
  permits. It appears more important to emphasize negotiating principles that 
  are widely accepted, regarded as equitable, and politically feasible. Beckerman 
  and Pasek (1995), for instance, propose to minimize the proportionate loss of 
  welfare in any voluntary agreement for public goods and lay a smaller burden 
  on the poorest participants.</p>
<p>Much of the debate about equity in climate change mitigation deals with social, 
  economic, and political issues, including international economic development 
  and the unequal distribution of wealth within and among countries. Views diverge 
  widely. Is climate change an opportunity to solve the large problems of sustainable 
  development and global distribution of wealth? Or would broadening the scope 
  for the anyway complex and controversial issue of climate change run the risk 
  of neither solving the climate problem nor improving prospects for sustainable 
  development. Helm (1999) presents an analysis of fair sharing of GHG limitation 
  burdens by separating the climate issue from the dispute about the global welfare 
  distribution. In contrast, Rayner and Malone (2000) pursue a holistic approach 
  to equity and address climate change as an arena in which to debate a wide variety 
  of economic and political issues. In this context, equity is perceived as a 
  basis for generating social capital, which is necessary, together with economic, 
  natural, and intellectual capital, for sustainability.</p>
