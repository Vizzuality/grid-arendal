<h4>6.2.2.3 Tradable Permits </h4>
<p>A country committed to a limit on its GHG emissions can meet this limit by 
  implementing a tradable permit system that directly or indirectly limits emissions 
  of the domestic sources covered by the commitment. The large number and diverse 
  nature of the sources covered by national limits on GHG emissions raises issues 
  of how to assign permit liability. If permit liability is imposed at the point 
  of release to the atmosphere, a so-called &#147;downstream&#148; system, individual 
  vehicle owners and households would have to participate.</p>
<p>Some emissions, such as HFCs, sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>), and energy-related 
  CO<sub>2</sub>, can be controlled indirectly, with a so-called &#147;upstream&#148; 
  system, by limiting substances that ultimately result in GHG emissions (see, 
  e.g., IPCC, 1996; Bohm, 1999).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#36","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>36</sup></small></a> 
  Since energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are linked to the carbon content 
  of fossil fuels, the system could be implemented by requiring fossil fuel producers 
  and importers to hold permits equal to the carbon content of the fuels sold 
  domestically.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#37","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>37</sup></small></a> 
  Permit liability for energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions could be imposed 
  at any point in the fossil fuel distribution chain and at different points for 
  different categories of sources, for example downstream for large industrial 
  sources and on petroleum companies for transportation fuels.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#38","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>38</sup></small></a> 
  Industrial non-energy sources of GHG emissions also lend themselves, at least 
  partially, to inclusion in a tradable permit system (Haites and Proestos, 2000).</p>
<p>Permits equal to the emissions limit are distributed (gratis or by auction, 
  usually to permit-liable entities) and each permit-liable entity is required 
  to hold permits equal to its actual GHG emissions or actual sales of regulated 
  substances as appropriate. Permits may be traded, at least domestically and 
  at least among permit-liable entities. Such a tradable permit system is well 
  known from the literature to be cost-effective if transactions costs are not 
  prohibitively high and if there are no significant imperfections in the permit 
  market and other markets pertaining to the emitting activities (see IPCC, 1996, 
  p. 417).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#39","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>39</sup></small></a></p>
<p>Some sources of GHG emissions, such as methane emissions from livestock, as 
  well as small sources, are very difficult to include in a tradable permit system 
  because it is difficult to measure actual emissions (or an accurate proxy for 
  actual emissions). In practice, then, the emissions cap for the tradable permit 
  system is less than the national emissions limit and some sources need to be 
  addressed by other policies.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#40","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>40</sup></small></a> 
  For example, a government that takes part in an international agreement, such 
  as the Kyoto Protocol, may establish an emissions cap for the tradable permit 
  system on the basis of the initial national limit or the <i>ex post</i> limit, 
  taking into account its net transfers under the Kyoto mechanisms.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#41","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>41</sup></small></a></p>
<p>With a significant number of permit-liable entities it should be possible to 
  establish market institutions that have low transaction costs and that limit 
  the scope for market power.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#42","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>42</sup></small></a> 
  The only situation in which there might not be enough permit-liable entities 
  is in a small country with an oligopolistic market for fossil fuels and an &#147;upstream&#148; 
  trading system.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#43","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>43</sup></small></a> 
  In particular, if an exchange institution is used, transaction costs are likely 
  to be small and market power (the possibility of one or more market parties 
  to manipulate market conditions in their favour, or to try to achieve such a 
  result by taking speculative positions) is unlikely to have a noticeable influence 
  on the transaction volume or final market prices (e.g., Smith and Williams, 
  1982; Carl&eacute;n, 1999).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#44","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>44</sup></small></a> 
  If the domestic tradable-permit system is integrated with an IET market (see 
  <a href="246.htm#631">Section 6.3.1</a>)&#150;which further increases cost-effectiveness&#150;any 
  remaining market power concerns are greatly diminished.</p>
<p>Some analysts argue that to allow entities, in addition to permit-liable participants, 
  to participate in the market is desirable for several reasons. It allows the 
  risks of changes in permit prices to be borne by the entities (e.g., private 
  brokerage firms, traders, professional speculators, or arbitrators) best able 
  to bear those risks. It may also improve intertemporal efficiency if other entities 
  have relevant information not heeded by permit-liable participants. The behaviour 
  of participants in the permit market might need to be supervised in the same 
  manner as in other financial markets, regardless of whether they are permit-liable 
  or not, to prevent abuses such as insider trading and efforts to manipulate 
  the market.</p>
<p>Permit prices fluctuate, but this does not mean that prices of the products 
  of permit-liable entities fluctuate to the same extent. Crude oil prices change 
  daily, but the prices of various petroleum products, such as gasoline, are much 
  more stable. Forward contracts and options are used to transfer the risks of 
  price fluctuations to sources willing and able to bear those risks.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#45","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>45</sup></small></a> 
  The same mechanisms are likely to be used by permit-liable entities to deal 
  with the risks of fluctuations in permit prices.</p>
<p>The market value of the permits needed by a permit-liable entity is passed 
  on to customers in the form of higher prices, to employees through lower wages, 
  to shareholders through lower returns, and to suppliers through lower prices. 
  To answer how the costs are shifted to these different groups requires a comprehensive 
  model of the economy with accurate values for relevant price elasticities. Ultimately, 
  the costs are borne by individuals, with the impact on a particular person reflecting 
  his or her role as an employee, investor, and/or consumer of various products.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#46","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>46</sup></small></a></p>
<p>Permits can be distributed to permit-liable entities (and/or others) gratis 
  or by auction.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#47","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>47</sup></small></a> 
  Gratis allocation requires a rule for distributing the permits among the recipients. 
  Since the permits represent an asset transferred to the recipients it can be 
  difficult to find a rule that is considered fair by all. An auction raises revenue. 
  All of the revenue could be returned to permit-liable entities, but this needs 
  to be done in a manner that leaves them with an economic incentive to reduce 
  their emissions. The revenue could also be used for a variety of other purposes. 
  Compensation could be provided to industries, whether or not they are permit-liable 
  entities, or households that bear a disproportionate share of the impact. The 
  revenue could also be used to reduce existing distortionary taxes and so reduce 
  the net cost of the emission reduction policy (see <a href="260.htm#651">Section 
  6.5.1</a>). The introduction of an emissions trading programme, like the imposition 
  of any new tax or regulation, imposes adjustment costs on the affected entities. 
  This is true whether the permits are auctioned or distributed <i>gratis</i>. 
  Moreover, some gratis allocation rules discriminate against new entrants (IPCC, 
  1996; Cramton and Kerr, 1998; Zhang, 2000).</p>
<p>Assuming compliance, permits are a more certain means than taxes of achieving 
  quantified national emission limits. In addition, a tradable permit system with 
  auctioned permits is more likely to provide the efficient price signal than 
  a tax rate set by the government. However, the certainty of achieving the emissions 
  levels provided by a tradable permit system incurs the cost of permit prices 
  being uncertain. Some have argued in favour of introducing a trigger price into 
  a permit trading system to meet this concern, namely the absence of an upper 
  bound on the price and hence on compliance costs (See e.g., Kopp et al., 1999a). 
  When the permit price reaches the trigger, additional permits are sold by the 
  government to prevent the price from rising further. Such a hybrid system fails 
  to guarantee particular emissions levels, but does limit the economic cost of 
  the programme for its users.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#48","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>48</sup></small></a></p>
