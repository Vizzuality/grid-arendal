<h3>10.1.5 Robust Decision-making </h3>
<p>Uncertainty is a feature that pervades discussions on climate change issues. 
  IPCC SAR covered main areas of uncertainties, especially those related to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and their impact on meteorological phenomena 
    (IPCC, 1996a);<br>
  </li>
  <li>the potential of technological options and the relationships between climate 
    change and the dynamics of natural systems (IPCC, 1996b); and<br>
  </li>
  <li>socio-economic dimensions of climate change (IPCC, 1996c).</li>
</ul>
<p>Several sections in this report (<a href="064.htm">1.5</a>; <a href="071.htm#22">2.2</a>; 
  <a href="271.htm">7.2</a>; <a href="382.htm">10.1</a>) review new and complementary 
  perspectives that facilitate a better understanding of the tensions between 
  the limited capacity to predict and the urgent need to act in a situation faced 
  with high stakes of risk.</p>
<p>The implications of uncertainty are global in scale and long-term in their 
  impact; quantitative data for baselines and the consequences of climate change 
  are inadequate for decision making. In recent years, researchers and policymakers 
  have become increasingly concerned about the high levels of inherent uncertainty, 
  and the potentially severe consequences of decisions that have to be made.</p>
<p>Conventional frameworks for decision making on climate change policies presume 
  that relevant aspects of the contextual environment are to some extent predictable; 
  therefore uncertainty can be reduced to provide decision makers with appropriate 
  information within appropriate time frames.</p>
<p>This anticipatory management approach is based on the premise that it is possible 
  to predict and anticipate the consequences of decisions and hence to make a 
  proper decision once all the necessary information is gathered to make a scientific 
  forecast. The prevailing image is that &#147;given enough information and powerful 
  enough computers it is possible to predict with certainty, in a quantitative 
  form, which in turn makes it possible to control natural systems&#148; (Tognetti, 
  1999).</p>
<p><i>Anticipatory approaches</i> have successfully managed a wide range of decision 
  problems in which the relative uncertainties are reducible, and the stakes or 
  outcomes associated with the decisions to be made are modest (Kay <i>et al</i>., 1999). 
  A number of uncertainty analysis techniques, such as Monte Carlo sampling, Bayesian 
  methods, and fuzzy set theory, have been designed to perform sensitivity and 
  uncertainty analysis related to the quality and appropriateness of the data 
  used as inputs to models. However, these techniques, suitable for addressing 
  technical uncertainties, ignore those uncertainties that arise from an incomplete 
  analysis of the climate change phenomena, or from numerical approximations used 
  in their mathematical representations (modelling uncertainties), as well as 
  uncertainties that arise from omissions through lack of knowledge (epistemological 
  uncertainties). Current methods thus give decision makers limited information 
  regarding the magnitude and sources of the underlying uncertainties and fail 
  to provide them with straightforward information as input to the decision-making 
  process (Rotmans and de Vries, 1997).</p>
<p>The management of uncertainties is not just an academic issue but an urgent 
  task for climate change policy formulation and action. Various vested interests 
  may inhibit, delay, or distort public debate with the result that &#147;procrastination 
  is as real a policy option as any other, and indeed one that is traditionally 
  favoured in bureaucracies; and inadequate information is the best excuse for 
  delay&#148; (Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1990).</p>
<p>Funtowicz and Ravetz have proposed a highly articulated and operational scheme 
  for dealing with the problems of uncertainty and quality of scientific information 
  in the policy context. By displaying qualifying categories of the information&#150;numeral, 
  unit, spread, assessment, and pedigree (NUSAP)&#150;the NUSAP scheme provides 
  a framework for the inquiry and elicitation required to evaluate information 
  quality. By such means it is possible to convey alternative interpretations 
  of the meaning and quality of crucial quantitative information with greater 
  quality and coherence, and thus reduce distortion of its meaning.</p>
