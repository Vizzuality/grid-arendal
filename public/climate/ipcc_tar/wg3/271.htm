<h2>7.2 Elements in Costing </h2>
<h3><a name="721"></a>7.2.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>This section addresses a number of key conceptual issues related to mitigation 
  cost concepts, including definitions of private and social costs and methods 
  to assess the side effects and equity aspects of mitigation policies. An overview 
  is given of analytical approaches to assess mitigation costs, including a classification 
  and discussion of different modelling approaches and critical assumptions. The 
  issue of ancillary and co-benefits of climate change mitigation is discussed. 
  Valuation techniques are presented, as is the treatment of barrier removal and 
  implementation costs. A review of recent developments in the field of discounting 
  is then presented and the section concludes with an investigation of the linkages 
  between adaptation and mitigation. </p>
<h3><a name="722"></a>7.2.2 Cost Estimation in the Context of the Decisionmaking 
  Framework </h3>
<p>Actions taken to abate GHG emissions or to increase the size of carbon sinks 
  generally divert resources from other alternative uses. The theoretically precise 
  measure of the social costs of climate protection, therefore, is the total value 
  that society places on the goods and services forgone as a result of the diversion 
  of resources to climate protection. A social cost assessment should ideally 
  consider all welfare changes that result from the changes in resources demanded 
  and supplied by a given mitigation project or strategy in relation to a specific 
  non-policy case (see Hazilla and Kopp, 1990). The assessment should include, 
  as far as possible, all resource components and implementation costs. This means 
  that both the benefits and the costs of a mitigation action should be included 
  in the estimation. In some cases, the sum of all the benefits and costs associated 
  with a mitigation action could be negative, meaning that society benefits from 
  undertaking the mitigation action.</p>
<p>The conceptual foundation of all cost estimation is the value of the scarce 
  resources to individuals. Thus, values are based on individual preferences, 
  and the total value of any resource is the sum of the values of the different 
  individuals involved in the use of the resource. This distinguishes this system 
  of values from one based on &#147;expert&#148; preferences, or on the preferences 
  of political leaders. It also distinguishes it from value systems based on ecological 
  criteria, which give certain ecological goals a value in themselves, independent 
  of what individuals might want, now or in the future.</p>
<p>The values, which are the foundation of the estimation of costs, are measured 
  by the applied welfare economic concepts of the willingness to pay (WTP) of 
  individuals to buy the resource, or by the individuals&#146; willingness to 
  accept (WTA) compensation to part with the resource. The WTP measure of value 
  reflects the maximum people are willing to pay to live in a world with climate 
  policy in force rather than not. WTA is the minimum compensation people would 
  accept to live without this climate policy (e.g., Willig, 1976; Randall and 
  Stoll, 1980; Hanemann, 1991; Shogren <i>et al</i>., 1994). The concepts of WTP and 
  WTA therefore play a critical part in defining the social cost method. </p>
<p>WTP or WTA is most commonly approximated by the consumer and producer surplus 
  as revealed in the demand and supply schedules for the resources whose consumption 
  and production is affected by the mitigation action. These measures are standard 
  economic tools of cost&#150;benefit analysis (Hanley <i>et al</i>., 1997). In some 
  cases, however, the resources that are affected do not have well-defined markets 
  and hence lack identifiable demand and supply schedules. Examples are changes 
  in air quality, or changes in recreational use of forests. In such cases other 
  methods of measuring WTP and WTA are required. These have been developed recently 
  and can now provide credible estimates for a range of non-marketed resources, 
  though some debate remains over the application of such values to all policy-relevant 
  impacts.</p>
<p>There is also a relationship between WTP and WTA and the conventional aggregate 
  measures of economic activity such as gross domestic product (GDP). The classic 
  paper on this is Weitzman (1976), which showed that GDP less depreciation of 
  capital (or &#147;net national product&#148;) is a measure of the net output 
  that represents the income on the economy&#146;s capital stock when that economy 
  is operating according to competitive market rules. However, a competitive economy 
  is also one that maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surpluses. Hence 
  GDP is closely linked to consumer and producer surplus maximization for commodities 
  that operate through the market place. However, the relationship breaks down 
  if competitive markets do not exist for all scarce resources. In this case, 
  GDP changes do not fully reflect changes in social welfare. </p>
<p>A frequent criticism of this costing method is that it is inequitable, as it 
  gives greater weight to the &#147;well off&#148;. This is because, typically, 
  a well-off person has a greater WTP or WTA than a less well-off person and hence 
  the choices made reflect more the preferences of the better off. This criticism 
  is valid, but there is no coherent and consistent method of valuation that can 
  replace the existing one in its entirety. Concerns about, for example, equity 
  can be addressed along with the basic cost estimation. The estimated costs are 
  one piece of information in the decision-making process for climate change that 
  can be supplemented with other information on other social objectives, for example 
  impacts on key stakeholders and the meeting of poverty objectives. </p>
