  <i>See<b> International Energy Agency.</b></i></p>
<p><b>IGO</b><br>
  <i>See<b> Intergovernmental Organization.</b></i><br>
</p>
<p><b>Implementation</b><br>
  Implementation refers to the actions (legislation or regulations, judicial decrees, 
  or other actions) that governments take to translate international accords into 
  domestic law and policy. It includes those events and activities that occur 
  after the issuing of authoritative public policy directives, which include the 
  effort to administer and the substantive impacts on people and events. It is 
  important to distinguish between the legal implementation of international commitments 
  (in national law) and the effective implementation (measures that induce changes 
  in the behaviour of target groups). <i>Compliance</i> is a matter of whether 
  and to what extent countries do adhere to the provisions of the accord. Compliance 
  focuses not only on whether implementing measures are in effect, but also on 
  whether there is compliance with the implementing actions. Compliance measures 
  the degree to which the actors whose behaviour is targeted by the agreement, 
  whether they be local government units, corporations, organizations, or individuals, 
  conform to the implementing measures and obligations. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Implementation costs</b><br>
  Costs involved in the implementation of <i><b>mitigation</b></i> options. These 
  costs are associated with the necessary institutional changes, information requirements, 
  market size, <i><b>opportunities</b></i> for <i><b>technology</b></i> gain and 
  learning, and economic incentives needed (grants, subsidies, and taxes).<br>
</p>
<p><b>Income elasticity</b><br>
  The percentage change in the quantity of demand for a good or service, given 
  a 1% change in income.</p>
<p><b>Industrial ecology</b><br>
  The set of relationships of a particular industry with its environment; often 
  refers to the conscious planning of industrial processes so as to minimize their 
  negative interference with the surrounding environment (e.g., by heat and materials 
  cascading).<br>
</p>
<p><b>Industrialization</b><br>
  The conversion of a society from one based on manual labour to one based on 
  the application of mechanical devices.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Inertia</b> <br>
  Property by which matter continues in its existing state of rest or uniform 
  motion in a straight line, unless that state is changed by external force. In 
  the context of <i><b>climate change mitigation</b></i>, it is associated with 
  different forms of capital (e.g., physical man-made capital, natural capital, 
  and social non-physical capital, including institutions, regulations, and norms).<br>
</p>
<p><b>Infrastructure</b><br>
  The basic installations and facilities upon which the operation and growth of 
  a community depend, such as roads, schools, electric, gas and water utilities, 
  transportation, and communications systems.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Integrated assessment</b><br>
  A method of analysis that combines results and models from the physical, biological, 
  economic, and social sciences, and the interactions between these components, 
  in a consistent framework to evaluate the status and the consequences of environmental 
  change and the policy responses to it.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Interaction effect</b><br>
  The result or consequence of the interaction of <b><i>climate change</i></b> 
  policy instruments with existing domestic tax systems, including both cost-increasing 
  tax interaction and cost-reducing revenue-recycling effect. The former reflects 
  the impact that <b><i>greenhouse gas</i></b> policies can have on the functioning 
  of labour and capital markets through their effects on real wages and the real 
  return to capital. By restricting the allowable <i><b>greenhouse gas emissions</b></i>, 
  permits, regulations, or a <i>carbon tax<b> </b></i>raise the costs of production 
  and the prices of output, thus reducing the real return to labour and capital. 
  For policies that raise revenue for the government, <i>carbon taxes</i> and 
  auctioned permits, the revenues can be recycled to reduce existing distortionary 
  taxes. See also <i><b>double dividend</b></i>.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Intergovernmental Organization (IGO)</b><br>
  Organizations constituted of governments. Examples include the World Bank, the 
  Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International 
  Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
  (IPCC), and other UN and regional organizations. The<i><b> Climate Convention 
  </b></i>allows accreditation of these IGOs to attend the negotiating sessions.<br>
  <br>
  <b>International emissions/carbon/energy tax</b><br>
  <i>See<b> emissions tax.</b></i><br>
</p>
<p><b>International Energy Agency (IEA)</b><br>
  Paris-based energy forum established in 1974. It is linked with the Organization 
  for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to enable member countries 
  to take joint measures to meet oil supply emergencies, to share energy information, 
  to co-ordinate their energy policies, and to co-operate in the development of 
  rational energy programmes.<br>
