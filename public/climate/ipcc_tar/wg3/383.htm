<h3>10.1.2 Scope of the Problem </h3>
<p>Climate change is a problem that is inherently different from other environmental 
  problems with which humanity has grappled, because the assumption that prior 
  experience with other air-pollution problems is a good model upon which to base 
  climate policy responses fails at many levels. At least six unique features 
  characterize the issue.</p>
<h4><a name="10121"></a>10.1.2.1 The Problem Is Global</h4>
<p><i>Public goods issues</i><br>
  Traditional environmental air-pollution problems have been amenable to local 
  solutions. The dirty air in a North American city is of no direct consequence 
  to a city in New Zealand. With climate change it is the emissions of all sources 
  in all nations that determine the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in 
  the atmosphere. As a consequence, the climate change problem is inherently a 
  public goods problem. That is, the climate that everyone enjoys is the product 
  of everyone&#146;s behaviour. No single individual or nation can determine the 
  composition of the world&#146;s atmosphere. Any individuals&#146; or nations&#146; 
  actions to address the climate change issue, even the largest emitting nation 
  acting alone, can have only a small effect. As a consequence, individuals and 
  nations acting independently will provide, together, fewer resources than all 
  individuals and nations would if they acted in concert. This characteristic 
  provides an important motivation for collective, global action.</p>
<p><i>Multiplicity of decision makers</i><br>
  Multiplicity of decision makers also implies that there are limits to collective 
  actions. Decisions by actors at a wide range of levels&#150;global governmental 
  organizations, nation states, regional governments, private individuals, multinational 
  firms, local enterprises&#150;all matter. The global nature of the problem also 
  implies that the full breadth of human social structures is encompassed. This 
  in turn implies that a diversity of policy responses is needed. Policy responses 
  that are effective and appropriate in one social context may be completely inappropriate 
  in another.</p>
<p><i>Heterogeneity</i><br>
  Emissions and consequences are also heterogeneous around the world. This exacerbates 
  the basic public goods nature of the problem. Countries are distributed across 
  a spectrum of high emitters to low emitters and high impacts to low impacts. 
  Nations with high emissions and low expected impacts have a high potential to 
  control concentrations, but little incentive. On the other hand, nations with 
  low emissions and high impacts have great incentive to control emissions, but 
  little capability. While side payments could, in principle, resolve this dilemma, 
  transaction costs may be significant and the present income distributions may 
  lead to unacceptable outcomes. Furthermore, most of the people who will be directly 
  affected by the problem have not been born yet, which limits their ability to 
  negotiate. Both emissions and the capability to mitigate carbon emissions to 
  the atmosphere are unevenly distributed around the world. A dozen countries 
  control 95% of conventional carbon-based energy resources&#150;conventional 
  oil, conventional gas, and coal. Unconventional resources&#150;deep gas, methane 
  hydrates, and shales&#150;while presently expensive relative to conventional 
  fuels, have an unknown distribution in potentially vast quantities. Fifteen 
  nations emit more than 75% of the world&#146;s annual carbon emissions.</p>
