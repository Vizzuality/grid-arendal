<h4>6.3.3.2 Technology Transfer </h4>
<p>The transfer of environmentally sound technologies from developed to developing 
  countries has come to be seen as a major element of the global strategies to 
  achieve sustainable development and climate change mitigation. Article 4.5 and 
  other relevant provisions of the UNFCCC (UNFCCC, 1992) clearly define the nature 
  and scope of the technology transfer, which includes environmentally sound and 
  economically viable technologies and know-how conducive to mitigating and adapting 
  to climate change. Technology transfer implemented through the financial mechanism 
  of the UNFCCC is to be &#147;on a grant or concessional basis&#148;, on non-commercial 
  terms. The Parties included in Annex II &#147;shall take all practicable steps 
  to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access 
  to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly 
  developing country Parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the 
  Convention.&#148; Article 10, paragraph (c) of the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, 1997) 
  reiterated that all Parties shall: &#147;co-operate in the promotion of effective 
  modalities for the development, application and diffusion of, and take all practicable 
  steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or 
  access to, environmentally sound technologies, know-how, practices and processes 
  pertinent to climate change, in particular to developing countries, including 
  the formulation of polices and programmes for the effective transfer of environmentally 
  sound technologies that are publicly owned or in the public domain and the creation 
  of an enabling environment for the private sector, to promote and enhance the 
  transfer of, and access to, environmentally sound technologies.&#148;</p>
<p>Three conditions have to be fulfilled for an effective transfer of technologies. 
  First, the technology holder country must be willing to transfer the technology. 
  Second, the technology must fit into the demand of the recipient country. Third, 
  the transfer must be made at reasonable cost to the recipient. The IPCC Special 
  Report on Technology Transfer (IPCC, 2000) identifies various important barriers 
  that could impede environmental technology transfer, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lack of data, information, and knowledge, especially on &#147;emerging&#148; 
    technologies;<br>
  </li>
  <li>inadequate vision about and understanding of local needs and demands; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>high transaction costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some analysts argue with respect to the third item that the technology should 
  be provided on favourable terms and therefore on non-commercial conditions, 
  strictly separated from traditional technology transfers, and supported by government 
  funding.</p>
<p>In fact, Agenda 21 (UN, 1992) states that &#147;governments and international 
  organizations should promote effective modalities for the access and transfer 
  of environmentally sustainable technologies (ESTs) by means of activities, including 
  the formulation of policies and programmes for the effective transfer of ESTs 
  that are publicly owned or in the public domain.&#148; The major role of the 
  government could be to supply EST research and develop funds to transfer publicly 
  owned technology to developing countries. In this regard, the Commission on 
  Sustainable Development, at its fifth session, concluded that: &#147;a proportion 
  of technology is held or owned by Governments and public institutions or results 
  from publicly-funded research and development activities. The Government&#146;s 
  control and influence over the technological knowledge produced in publicly-funded 
  research and development institutions opens up a potential for the generation 
  of publicly-owned technologies that could be made accessible to developing countries, 
  and could be an important means for Governments to catalyze private sector technology 
  transfer.&#148; In all countries the role of publicly funded R&amp;D in the 
  development of ESTs is significant. Through both policy and public funding, 
  the public sector continues to be an important driver in the development of 
  ESTs.</p>
<p>An additional role of the government is to make the legal provisions for the 
  transfer of ESTs (including checking on abuse of restrictive business practices 
  (Raekwon, 1997)). Good governance creates an enabling environment for private 
  sector technology transfer within and across national boundaries. Although many 
  ESTs are in common use and could be diffused through commercial channels, their 
  spread is hampered by risks such as those arising from weak legal protection 
  and inadequate regulation in developed and developing countries. However, many 
  technologies that can mitigate emissions or contribute to adaptation to climate 
  change have not yet been commercialized. Beyond an enabling environment, it 
  will take extra efforts to enhance the transfer of those ESTs (IPCC, 2000). 
  It should also be recognized that the effective transfer of ESTs requires substantial 
  upgrading of the technological capacities in the developing countries (TERI, 
  1997) (see also <a href="179.htm">Chapters 5</a> and <a href="379.htm">10</a>).</p>
