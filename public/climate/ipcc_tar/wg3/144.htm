<h2>A3.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Alternatives and substitutes for HFCs, perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and ozone depleting 
  substances (ODSs) have recently been extensively evaluated. The Montreal Protocol 
  Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) and its technical committees 
  published a comprehensive assessment (UNEP, 1999b). Furthermore, reports were 
  published within the framework of the joint IPCC/TEAP workshop (IPCC/TEAP, 1999) 
  and the second non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases conference (van Ham <i>et al</i>., 
  2000). </p>
<p>The HFCs that are projected for large volume use have global warming potentials 
  (GWPs) which are generally lower than those of the ODSs they replace. The GWP 
  of HFCs replacing ODSs range from 140 to 11,700. HFC-23 with a GWP of 11,700 
  is used as a replacement for ODSs to only a very minor extent. However, there 
  are relatively large emissions of HFC-23 from the HCFC-22 manufacturing process. 
  The majority of HFCs have GWPs much lower than that of HFC-23. PFCs have GWPs 
  that are generally higher than those of the ODSs they replace, ranging from 
  7,000 to 9,200 (IPCC, 1996). <a href="#taba31">Table A3.1</a> lists the atmospheric 
  properties of the HFCs and HFC blends considered in this Appendix. </p>

<p>Most HFCs are used for energy-consuming applications such as refrigeration, 
  air conditioning and heat pumps, and building and appliance insulation. Life 
  cycle climate performance (LCCP) analysis is being used to estimate the net 
  contribution to climate change. It includes all direct greenhouse gas emissions 
  and indirect emissions related to energy consumption associated with the design 
  and the operational modes of systems (UNEP, 1999b; Papasavva and Moomaw, 1998). 
  The LCCP is a very system specific parameter that can be used to make relative 
  rankings. However, LCCP analysis involves regional differences &#150; including 
  different fuel sources &#150; and the related equipment operating conditions; 
  the results can therefore not be generalized in order to make globally valid 
  comparisons.<br>
  <br>
  The energy efficiency of equipment and products can be expressed in at least 
  three ways: theoretical maximum efficiency, maximum efficiency achievable with 
  current technology, and actual efficiency for commercial scale production (often 
  expressed as a range of values). Systems optimized for a new refrigerant have 
  been compared to sub-optimum systems with other refrigerants. Furthermore, appliance 
  sizes and features that influence energy performance vary between studies and 
  test conditions, and methodologies are often significantly different. These 
  factors have led to a wide range of energy efficiency claims in technical reports 
  and commercial publications. Ultimately, the performance and cost effectiveness 
  of specific products from commercial scale production must be directly compared. 
  Furthermore, costs reported in this appendix might not always be comparable 
  because of differing estimation methods, including estimates based on both consumer 
  and producer costs.</p>

<h3>A3.1.1 Past Trends</h3>

        <b>Figure A3.1:</b> Estimated global consumption of CFCs, halons, HCFCs, 
        and HFCs (McFarland, 1999).</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Unlike anthropogenic greenhouse gases emitted as an immediate consequence of 
  the burning of fossil fuels to generate energy, most HFCs and PFCs are contained 
  within equipment or products for periods ranging from a few months (e.g., in 
  aerosol propellants) to years (e.g., in refrigeration equipment) to decades 
  (e.g., in insulating foams). Thus, emissions significantly lag consumption and, 
  because HFC systems are relatively new, emissions will continue to grow after 
  2010.</p>
<p>Both the quantities used and patterns of use of ODSs, HFCs, and PFCs are changing 
  (see <a href="#figa31">Figure A3.1</a>) as ODSs are phased out under the Montreal 
  Protocol (IPCC/TEAP, 1999; McFarland, 1999). In 1986, less than half of total 
  ODS use was in insulating foams, fire protection, refrigeration, air conditioning, 
  and heat pumps, with more than half as aerosol product propellants, non-insulating 
  foam, solvent, and specialized applications. However, by 1997, the global consumption 
  of fluorocarbons (CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs) had decreased by about 50% as solvent, 
  aerosol product, and non-insulating foam applications switched to alternatives 
  other than fluorocarbons. Refrigeration, air conditioning, and insulating foam 
  accounted for about 85% of the remaining total fluorocarbon use. 80% of projected 
  chlorofluorocarbon demand was avoided by reducing emissions, redesign, and use 
  of non-fluorocarbon technologies. As CFCs, halons, and HCFCs are phased out 
  globally, the quantities of fluorocarbons are expected to continue to decline 
  in the short term, but are expected to grow in the longer term.</p>
<a name="a312"></a> 
<h3>A3.1.2 Projections</h3>
<p>Future global HFC and PFC consumption and/or emissions as substitutes for ODSs 
  have been separately estimated by IPCC (1995), Midgley and McCulloch (1999), 
  and UNEP (1998a). Midgley and McCulloch (1999) projected carbon-equivalent emissions 
  of HFCs and PFCs (excluding unintended chemical by-product emissions) at 60MtC<sub>eq</sub> 
  in 2000, 150MtC<sub>eq</sub> in 2010 and 280MtC<sub>eq</sub> in 2020. Projected 
  consumption data for 2000 and 2010 are primarily based on UNEP reports (UNEP, 
  1998f, 1999b) and are shown in <a href="145.htm#taba32">Table A3.2</a>. Considering 
  that emissions lag consumption by many years, the Midgley and McCulloch figures 
  are much larger than the UNEP figures. This discrepancy is consistent with the 
  Midgley and McCulloch scenario which was constructed to represent plausible 
  upper limits to future emissions (McFarland, 1999). HFC emissions in the SRES 
  scenarios (IPCC, 2000) are 54MtC<sub>eq</sub> in 2000 and 130-136MtC<sub>eq</sub> 
  in 2010. These values are higher than those presented in <a href="145.htm#taba32">Table 
  A3.2</a> because of the top-down approach used in SRES that does not adequately 
  account for delay between use and emissions in the 2000 to 2010 timeframe. Considering 
  this fact and given the options for substitution, containment, etc., it is estimated 
  that emissions in 2010 could well be about 100MtC<sub>eq</sub> below the SRES 
  forecast at a marginal cost lower than US$200/tC<sub>eq</sub>. None of the scenarios 
  have considered the implications of new uses of HFCs or PFCs other than as substitutes 
  for ODSs.</p>
<p>Projected consumption and emission estimates for HFCs by sub-sector for 2000 
  and 2010 are summarized in <a href="145.htm#taba32">Table A3.2</a>.</p>
