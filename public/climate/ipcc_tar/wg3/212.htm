<p><i>Countinued from previous page</i></p>
<p>In addition to the problems identified above, other important barriers include 
  (1) the &#147;invisibility&#148; of energy efficiency measures and the difficulty 
  of demonstrating and quantifying their impacts; (2) lack of inclusion of external 
  costs of energy production and use in the price of energy, and (3) slow diffusion 
  of innovative technology into markets (Fisher and Rothkopf, 1989; Levine <i>et al</i>., 1994; Sanstad and Howarth, 1994). Regulation can contribute to more successful 
  innovation (see above), but sometimes, indirectly, be a barrier to implementation 
  of low GHG emitting practices. A specific example is industrial co-generation 
  (CHP), which may be hindered by the lack of clear policies for buy-back of excess 
  power, regulation for standby power, and wheeling of power to other users (<a href="#box55">Box 
  5.5</a>). Co-generation in the Indian sugar industry was hindered by the lack 
  of these regulations (WWF, 1996), while the existence of clear policies can 
  be a driver for diffusion and expansion of industrial co-generation, as is evidenced 
  by the development of industrial co-generation in the Netherlands (Blok, 1993). 
  Finally, firms typically under-invest in R&amp;D, despite the high paybacks 
  (Nelson, 1982; Cohen and Noll, 1994), but recent analyses seem to suggest that 
  public and private R&amp;D funding for sustainable energy technologies is decreasing 
  in developed countries (Kammen and Margolis, 1999).</p>

    <td class="box"><b>Box 5.5. Combined (Cooling) Heating and Power or Cogeneration 
      </b> 
      <p>Co-generation is applied in utility district heating and in distributed 
        on-site power units. Most barriers to on-site co-generation are the same 
        barriers as the ones that impede the development of other types of distributed 
        and/or independent power generation projects. The most important barriers 
        are related to information, technology character, regulatory and energy 
        policy.</p>
      <p><b>Informational barriers </b><br>
        The significant technological advances of recent years (Major, 1995; Rohrer, 
        1996) are not spread widely enough. This barrier is the most stringent 
        in developing countries and in small institutions and companies, especially 
        when the latter have no technical background. When donors, international 
        institutions, lending banks, etc. are not familiar with the co-generation 
        technology, it will not be implemented by developing and transitional 
        economies (Dadhich, 1996; Nielsen and Bernsen, 1996). Additionally, the 
        economics of co-generation is relatively complex (Verbruggen <i>et al</i>., 1992; 
        Hoff <i>et al</i>., 1996; Verbruggen, 1996). Optimization of co-generation projects 
        requires extensive information about many determinants of profitability. 
        This span of know-how makes its availability to small-scale independent 
        projects exceptional. Finally, uncertainty about the main determinants 
        like fuel prices, fuel availability, regulatory conditions, environmental 
        legislation, contract terms with the power grid, etc. constitutes a significant 
        barrier.</p>
      <p><b>Decentralized character of the technology </b><br>
        Private investors impose high profitability standards on distributed generation 
        projects. This payback gap is mainly due to a risk-averse attitude regarding 
        non-core business activities. The distances to the energy grids (electricity, 
        natural gas) limit the capacity or co-generation opportunities. Unequal 
        treatment with respect to fuel supplies, authorization and licensing arrangements, 
        and environmental and emissions regulation, constitutes an additional 
        set of barriers that especially affect the small-scale distributed generation 
        projects and add to the costs of the technology (COGEN Europe, 1997).</p>
      <p><b>The terms of grid connection </b><br>
        In several countries, the position and attitude of the grid operator have 
        been hostile towards distributed generation initiatives (R&uuml;dig, 1986; 
        Dufait, 1996). Incumbent power companies sometimes impose heavy regulations 
        on producers or industries that file for a connection to the electricity 
        grid, imposing technical prescriptions that cannot be set in standard 
        packages. Tariff conditions are a particularly difficult issue, because 
        the value of the kWh is dependent on time, place, quality, and reliability 
        of supply, and differs for the three types of power flows that can be 
        exchanged: surplus power that the co-generator delivers to the grid, shortage 
        or make-up power bought by the co-generator at the grid, and back-up power 
        (Verbruggen, 1990). Although there are widely accepted principles to fix 
        the tariff for the different transactions, theoretical and practical difficulties 
        in defining and measuring the costs constrain the development of contracts 
        (Dismukes and Kleit, 1999). In many countries high tariffs on wheeling 
        of electricity act as an additional barrier. In several countries the 
        opportunities for small-scale distributed power generation are improving 
        because grid connection is provided at neutral or even subsidized terms 
        (the Netherlands and Japan; Blok and Farla, 1996). </p>
      <p><b>Energy policy </b><br>
        Utility co-generation requires long-term planning from an integrated point 
        of view (WEC, 1991). Very few nations own the intellectual and administrative 
        capacity to realize an integrated energy policy plan that preserves the 
        place for district heating and related co-generation. Some countries (e.g., 
        Denmark) and international organizations have favoured the development 
        of CHP (EC, 1997). Firm public policy and regulatory authority is necessary 
        to install and safeguard harmonized conditions, transparancy and unbundling 
        of the main power supply functions, and the position of independent players 
        (Fox-Penner, 1990).</p>

<p><i>Programmes and Policies for Technological Diffusion </i><br>
  A wide array of policies, to reduce the barriers or the perception of barriers 
  has been used and tested in the industrial sector in developed countries (Worrell 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997), with varying success rates. With respect to technology diffusion 
  policies there is no single instrument to reduce barriers; instead, an integrated 
  policy accounting for the characteristics of technologies, stakeholders, and 
  countries addressed would be helpful.</p>
<p>Selection of technology is a crucial step in any technology transfer. Information 
  programmes are designed to assist energy consumers in understanding and employing 
  technologies and practices to use energy more efficiently. Information needs 
  are strongly determined by the situation of the actor. Therefore, successful 
  programmes should be tailored to meet these needs. Surveys in western Germany 
  (Gruber and Brand, 1991) and the Netherlands (Velthuijsen, 1995) showed that 
  trade literature, personal information from equipment manufacturers and exchange 
  between colleagues are important information sources. In the United Kingdom, 
  the &#145;&#145;Best Practice&#146;&#146; programme aims to improve information 
  on energy efficient technologies, by demonstration projects and information 
  dissemination. The programme objective is to stimulate energy savings worth 
  US$5 for every US$1 invested (Collingwood and Goult, 1998). In developing countries 
  technology information is more difficult to obtain. Energy audit programmes 
  are a more targeted type of information transaction than simple advertising. 
  Energy audit programmes exist in numerous developing countries, and limited 
  information available from 11 different countries found that on average 56% 
  of the recommended measures were implemented by audit recipients (Nadel <i>et al</i>., 
  1991). </p>
<p>Environmental legislation can be a driving force in the adoption of new technologies, 
  as evidenced by the case studies for India (TERI, 1997), and the process for 
  uptake of environmental technologies in the USA (Clark, 1997). Market deregulation 
  can lead to higher energy prices in developing countries (Worrell <i>et al</i>., 1997), 
  although efficiency gains may lead to lower prices for some consumers. </p>
<p>Direct subsidies and tax credits or other favourable tax treatments have been 
  a traditional approach for promoting activities that are socially desirable. 
  An example of a financial incentive programme that has had a large impact on 
  energy efficiency is the energy conservation loan programme that China instituted 
  in 1980. This loan programme is the largest energy efficiency investment programme 
  ever undertaken by any developing country, and currently commits 7% to 8% of 
  total energy investment to efficiency, primarily in heavy industry. The programme 
  contributed to the remarkable decline in the energy intensity of China&#146;s 
  economy. Since 1980 energy consumption has grown at an average rate of 4.8% 
  per year (compared to 7.5% in the 1970s) while GDP has grown twice as fast (9.5% 
  per year), mainly thanks to falling industrial sector energy intensity. Of the 
  apparent intensity drop in industry in the 1980s, about 10% can be attributed 
  directly to the efficiency investment programme (Sinton and Levine, 1994). </p>
<p>New approaches to industrial energy efficiency improvement in developed countries 
  include voluntary agreements (VA). A VA generally is a contract between the 
  government (or an other regulating agency) and a private company, association 
  of companies or other institution. The content of the agreement may vary. The 
  private partners may promise to attain certain energy efficiency improvement, 
  emission reduction target, or at least try to do so. The government partner 
  may promise to financially support this endeavour, or promise to refrain from 
  other regulating activities. Many developed countries have adopted VAs directed 
  at energy efficiency improvement or environmental pollution control (EEA, 1997; 
  IEA, 1997; B&ouml;rkey and L&eacute;v&ecirc;que, 1998; OECD, 2000). There is 
  a wide variety in VAs, ranging from public and consumer recognition for participation 
  in a programme (e.g., Energy Star Program in the USA) to legally binding negotiated 
  agreements (e.g., the Long-Term Agreements in the Netherlands). Voluntary agreements 
  can have some apparent advantages above regulation, in that they may be easier 
  and faster to implement, and may lead to more cost-effective solutions. Initial 
  experiences with environmental VAs with respect to effectiveness and efficiency 
  varied strongly, although only a few ex-post evaluations are available as most 
  voluntary approaches are recent (EEA, 1997; Worrell <i>et al</i>., 1997, B&ouml;rkey 
  and L&eacute;v&ecirc;que, 1998). The Dutch long-term agreements on energy efficiency 
  in industry have been evaluated favourably, and are expected to achieve the 
  targets for most sectors (Universiteit Utrecht, 1997). The evaluation highlighted 
  the need for more open and consistent mechanisms for reporting, target setting, 
  and supportive policies. Preliminary evaluations show that VAs are most suitable 
  for pro-active industries, a small number of participants, mature sectors with 
  limited competition, and long-term targets (EEA, 1997). The evaluations also 
  show that VAs are most effective if they include clear targets, a specified 
  baseline, a clear monitoring and reporting mechanism, and if there are technical 
  solutions available with relatively limited compliance costs (EEA, 1997). In 
  some cases the result of a VA may come close to those of a regulation, i.e., 
  in the case of negotiated agreements as used in some European countries. Outside 
  developed countries, also some NICs, e.g., Republic of Korea, consider the use 
  of VAs (Kim, 1998), while the Global Semiconductor Partnership is an example 
  of an international voluntary agreement to reduce PFC emissions.</p>
