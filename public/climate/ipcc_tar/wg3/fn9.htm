  1 US National Academy of Sciences (1992) reviews a number of studies on this 
  debate.<br>
  </span></p>
<p><span class="footnotetext"> <b><a name="2"></a>2</b> The reason for the major 
  reduction of &#150;7% in the DRI (1994) results for EU&#150;6 agricultural net 
  output is that the scenario contains a wide range of environmental policies 
  in addition to climate change policies, and many of these impinge heavily on 
  agriculture.<br>

<p><b><a name="3"></a>3</b> mtoe means million tonnes oil equivalent; 1 tonne 
  oil equivalent (toe) equals 45.37 GJ.</p>
<p><b><a name="4"></a>4</b> With the exception of Bartsch and Mueller (2000), 
  all of the economic studies discussed in this section assume adequate supplies 
  of conventional crude oil to 2020 and beyond, the generally accepted position 
  on the availability of this resource. However, there are analysts who predict 
  oil supply shortages before that date (Campbell, 1997). If such shortages were 
  to develop, oil use, and therefore CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, would decline without 
  the imposition of GHG mitigation policies. See Chapter 3 for an assessment of 
  the literature on fossil fuel reserves and resources.</p>
<p><b><a name="5"></a>5</b> Estimates of the price elasticity of crude oil demand 
  for the long and short terms differ across regions and sectors. A survey (Huntington, 
  1991) of inferred price elasticities from 11 world models found the OECD short-term 
  elasticity to be &#150;0.06 to &#150;0.20 (average &#150;0.12) and the long-term 
  elasticity to be &#150;0.35 to &#150;0.80 average &#150;0.47). The cor-responding 
  estimates for the non-OECD short-term elasticity are &#150;0.04 to &#150;0.14 
  (average &#150;0.11) and for the long term &#150;0.17 to &#150;0.54<br>
  (average &#150;0.30). The world average elasticity in the short term is &#150;0.10 
  and in the long term &#150;0.38.</p>
<p><b><a name="6"></a>6</b> 1 barrel oil equivalent (boe) equals 6.12GJ.</p>
<p><b><a name="7"></a>7</b> Methane has a Greenhouse Warming Potential (GWP) of 
  21 for a 100 year time horizon, making even small leaks significant contributors 
  to potential impacts on climate.</p>
<p><b><a name="8"></a>8</b> They note that their results should only be viewed 
  as indicative of the broad direction of the magnitude of impacts, and that they 
  do not account for any barriers to the expansion of nuclear in the USA, Canada, 
  the EU, and Japan.</p>
<p><b><a name="9"></a>9</b> The original calculations are in euro and a rate of 
  US$1=11 has been used for conversion.<br>
</p>
<p><b><a name="10"></a>10</b> Spillover effects can be defined as interdependencies 
  between countries, sectors or firms that take the form of technological synergies 
  and flows of stimuli and constraints that do not entirely correspond to commodity 
  flows (Dosi, 1988). The concept originates in the literature on technical change, 
  in order to account for the non-appropriability of scientific and technological 
  knowledge, which reduces the incentive to private R&amp;D and thus motivates 
  public investment in R&amp;D (Arrow, 1962).</p>
<p><b><a name="11"></a>11</b> More formally, the studies impose taxes on the carbon 
  content of energy as a factor of production (with labour and capital as other 
  factors) in a production function; depending on the precise assumptions chosen 
  this has the inevitable implication that output and GDP will fall. See Boero 
  <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1991), Hoeller <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1991), Cline (1992), Ekins (1995), and Mabey 
  <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1997) for surveys of the assumptions and results of the modelling in 
  this area.</p>
<p><b><a name="12"></a>12</b> See Shoven and Whalley (1992), Dervis <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1982), 
  Jorgenson (1995a, 1995b), Holden <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1994), Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) 
  for different methods of long-term modelling.</p>
<p><b><a name="13"></a>13</b> In the same way, models should incorporate other 
  benefits of limiting GHG emissions, but again the complexity of modelling and 
  valuing of these benefits are substantial. The ancillary benefits associated 
  with the abatement policies usually include reductions in damages from other 
  pollutants jointly produced with GHGs (see Chapter 8 and Barker, 1993; Barker 
  <i><i>et al</i></i>. 1993 and OECD 2000) but also include the conservation of biological diversity.</p>
<p><b><a name="14"></a>14</b> Nevertheless, in general the research on double 
  dividend of environmental taxes has resulted in conflicting and confusing conclusions. 
  See Bohm (1997) for a clear statement of the issues and O&#146;Riordan (1997) 
  for several reviews of theoretical and practical evidence of the dividends from 
  environmental taxation.</p>
<p><b><a name="15"></a>15</b> In general terms, from the economists&#146; point 
  of view, environmental regulation should rely on economic instruments instead 
  of command-<br>
  and-control policies, considering the cost-effective allocation of the control 
  responsibility of the former ones, which have proven to be efficient in simple 
  settings, see Bohm and Russell (1985), Baumol and Oates (1988), Montgomery (1972).</p>
<p><b><a name="16"></a>16</b> See Tietenberg (1990), Barrett <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1992), Barrett 
  (1991), Rose and Tietenberg (1993). See also the studies reported to the OECD 
  expert workshop on Climate Change and Economic Modelling, September 1998.</p>
<p><b><a name="17"></a>17</b> In terms of the Kyoto Protocol, for example, a specific 
  problem of modelling IET is the possibility that target emissions will be below 
  the base-year emissions. In the same way, variations from the full unrestricted 
  trading systems may change cost estimations. Two clear variations are: the definition 
  of trading entities (i.e. bubbles), and the limits of the amount of trading.<br>
