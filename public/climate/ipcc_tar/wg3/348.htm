<h3>8.4.4 Reasons why Energy-economy Models Tend to Favour Gradual Departure from 
  Baseline in the Near-term </h3>
<p>There are several reasons why the models tend to favour a more gradual departure 
  from their reference path if used to study a pre-determined concentration level. 
  First, energy using and energy producing capital stock (e.g., power plants, 
  buildings, and transport) are typically long lived. The current system was put 
  into place on the basis of a particular set of expectations about the future. 
  Large emission reductions in the near term require accelerated replacement, 
  which is apt to be costly. There is more opportunity for reducing emissions 
  cheaply at the point of capital stock turnover.</p>
<p>Second, the models suggest that currently there are insufficient low-cost substitutes, 
  on both the supply and demand sides of the energy sector, for deep near-term 
  cuts in carbon emissions. With the anticipated improvements in the efficiency 
  of energy supply, transformation, and end-use technologies, such reductions 
  should be less expensive in the future.</p>
<p>Third, because of positive returns on capital, future reductions can be made 
  with a smaller commitment of today&#146;s resources. For example, assume a net 
  real rate of return on capital of 5% per year. Further, suppose that it costs 
  US$50 to remove a tonne of carbon, regardless of the year in which the reduction 
  occurs. To remove the tonne today would cost US$50. Alternatively, it only needs 
  US$19 to be invested today to provide the resources to remove a tonne of carbon 
  in 2020.</p>
<p>Finally, for higher near-term emissions, the size of the carbon budget (to 
  meet a prescribed emission target) is higher, reflecting that the products of 
  early emissions have a longer time to be removed from the atmosphere, and because 
  the higher concentrations give higher oceanic and terrestrial sinks.</p>
<p>The fact that the least-cost mitigation pathway tends to follow the baseline 
  in the early years has been misconstrued by some analysts as an argument for 
  inaction. Wigley <i>et al. </i>(1996) note that this is far from the case: First, 
  all stabilization targets still require future capital stock to be less carbon-intensive 
  than under a business as usual (BAU) scenario. As most energy production and 
  use technologies are long-lived, this has implications for current investment 
  decisions. Second, new supply options typically take many years to enter the 
  marketplace. To ensure sufficient quantities of low-cost, low-carbon substitutes 
  in the future requires a sustained commitment to research, development and demonstration 
  today. Third, any no regrets measures for reducing emissions should be adopted 
  immediately. Lastly, it is clear that one cannot go on deferring emission reductions 
  indefinitely, and that the need for substantial reductions in emissions is sooner 
  the lower the concentration target.<br>
