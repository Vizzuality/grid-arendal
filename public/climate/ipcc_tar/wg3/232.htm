<h4>6.2.1.2 Price and Subsidy Policies </h4>
<p>Price signals can only influence demand and supply if they actually reach economic 
  agents and if those economic agents have the opportunity to respond to them. 
  In Russia, energy intensity increased by 30% between 1990 and 1998, while energy 
  prices also increased tremendously (IEA, 1997b, p. 50)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#14","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>14</sup></small></a>.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#14","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small></small></a> 
  Experience shows that it takes time for economic agents to adjust their behaviour 
  to new price signals, not only because of capital stock turnover, but also because 
  consumers often do not have an accurate knowledge of their energy consumption, 
  or the technical capacity to reduce it. Various types of energy market reforms 
  and the pace of energy price reforms are designed to create and clear channels 
  for market signals to work.</p>
<p>It is a difficult policy challenge, and therefore a time-consuming process, 
  to bring prices into line with real costs. This is true both in developing countries, 
  where the poor pay a high cost for low-quality energy services (or a low cost 
  that is heavily subsidized) and in developed countries. Although data on energy 
  subsidies are incomplete, partly because such support is difficult to identify 
  and measure, some evidence indicates that subsidies on coal production, including 
  transfers from both consumers and taxpayers, are declining in a number of OECD 
  and developing countries. Recent data suggest that the total producer subsidy 
  estimates for the coal production of Germany, UK, Spain, Belgium, and Japan, 
  which amounted to over US$13 billion at the beginning of the 1990s, had declined 
  to less than US$7 billion by 1996 (OECD, 1998a, 1998b). In addition, case studies 
  in the energy supply sector identified the following areas for potential subsidy 
  reforms: removal of coal-producer grants and price supports; reforming subsidies 
  to investment in the energy supply industry; and regulatory reform to eliminate 
  non-tariff barriers to the energy trade (OECD, 1997a, 1997b).</p>
<p>An IEA (1999b) analysis of fossil energy subsidies in China, Russia, India, 
  Indonesia, Iran, South Africa, Venezuela, and Kazakhstan&#150;which accounted 
  for 27.5% of the world&#146;s total energy demand in 1997&#150;claimed that 
  removing such subsidies would lower CO2 emissions by 16% in these countries, 
  amounting to a 4.6% reduction in global emissions<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#15","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>15</sup></small></a>.</p>
<p>The transport sector&#150;to give an important example&#150;is another sector 
  that receives subsidies detrimental to the environment. Transport is indirectly 
  subsidized through infrastructure financing and through tax benefits, which 
  enhance the transport volume. According to Shelby <i>et al</i>. (1997), energy 
  subsidies were higher than those to transportation for the OECD area. They also 
  found for the USA that larger CO<sub>2</sub> savings could be achieved through 
  reform of indirect rather than direct transport subsidies, such as free parking 
  and supporting the highway infrastructure. Reform policies to internalize external 
  the effects will, according to one study, probably lower sector-wide emissions 
  by 10&#150;15% (OECD, 1997c)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#16","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>16</sup></small></a>.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#16","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small></small></a> 
  These findings are in line with the results from other work on internalizing 
  the external cost of transportation (ECMT, 1998). The same studies also indicate 
  that local communities can better carry out policy reform in the transport sector, 
  because transport subsidies may originate at the local level and local communities 
  are more likely to value other ancillary benefits through policy reform (OECD, 
  1997c; ECMT, 1998). The transport sector is only mentioned as an example, because 
  it is responsible for a large share of the national emissions in many countries<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#17","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>17</sup></small></a>.<br>
