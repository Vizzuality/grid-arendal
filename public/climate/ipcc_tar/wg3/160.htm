<h3><a name="fig44"></a><a name="422"></a>4.2.2 Land Use in the Temperate and 
  Boreal Zones </h3>
<h4><a name="4221"></a>4.2.2.1 Historical and Present Land Use in the Temperate 
  and Boreal Zones </h4>
<p>The temperate zone is the most populated zone of the world, while the boreal 
  zone is quite sparsely populated. For thousands of years forest area has diminished, 
  particularly in the temperate zone, as forests were cleared for agriculture 
  and pasture. Clearing of the European Mediterranean region began ca 5000 years 
  ago; in Central Europe and in China deforestation occurred in early Medieval 
  times; in parts of Russia and Mongolia forest clearing occurred in late Medieval 
  times; and in North America clearing occurred mainly in the 19th century (Mather, 
  1990, see <a href="#fig44">Figure 4.4</a>). Since the mid 20th century the net 
  forest area of the temperate zone has no longer decreased but has instead increased 
  (Kauppi <i>et al</i>., 1992). The inner parts of the boreal zone in Siberia, 
  Alaska, and Canada have not been subject to significant land-use management. 
  The opportunities present to store carbon in terrestrial ecosystems in the boreal 
  and temperate zones are thus very much determined by historical land-use change 
  and the associated losses of carbon (Kurz and Apps, 1999).</p>
<p>Understanding the historic and current net sink of C in the temperate and boreal 
  zones is important to assessing the potential of present and future management 
  options. In general, estimates of C flows have been based on a variety of methods 
  and data, resulting in a wide range of reported values for C flows per region. 
  The confidence level in each separate value is therefore low. For example, for 
  European forests the estimates of the present C sink vary from almost 0 to 0.5 
  GtC/yr (Nabuurs <i>et al</i>., 1997; Martin <i>et al</i>., 1998; Valentini <i>et 
  al</i>., 2000; Schulze, 2000). For Canada, early estimates, based on a static 
  assessment, indicated a net sink of 0.08GtC/yr for the mid-1970s (Kurz <i>et 
  al</i>., 1992); whereas subsequent analyses, accounting for changes in forest 
  disturbances over time (see section <a href="162.htm">4.2.3</a>), indicated 
  that Canadian forests became a small net source of C (&#150;0.068GtC/yr) by 
  the early 1990s (Kurz and Apps, 1999). Estimates of carbon accumulation in woody 
  biomass for the USA also show a large uncertainty. While the average rate for 
  the USA C sink ranges from 0.020 to 0.098GtC/yr for the 1980s and 1990s (Birdsey 
  and Heath, 1995; Turner <i>et al</i>., 1995; Houghton <i>et al</i>., 1999), 
  atmospheric inversion models applied to the North American continent suggest 
  a sink of 1.7 &plusmn; 0.5GtC/yr, largely south of 51&ordm;N (Fan <i>et al</i>., 
  1998), but with very low levels of confidence (Bolin <i>et al</i>., 2000). </p>
<p>In the less intensively managed forests of Russia and Canada, changes in mortality 
  associated with natural disturbances appear to dominate over management influences 
  (see Section <a href="163.htm">4.2.4</a>). In European Russia, managed forest 
  ecosystems were estimated to be a sink of 0.051GtC/yr between 1983 and 1992, 
  but the less actively managed Siberian forest was a net source of 0.081&#150;0.12GtC/yr 
  (Shepashenko <i>et al</i>., 1998). The available estimates for Siberia differ 
  even more than for the other regions mentioned above, and their confidence level 
  may be &#147;low&#148; (Schulze <i>et al</i>., 1999). </p>
<p>Recent FAO statistics on 55 countries in the temperate and boreal zones indicate 
  a general increase in the forest carbon stock (trees only) of 0.88GtC/yr (UN-ECE/FAO, 
  2000). Changes in forest management and changes in the environment have contributed 
  to this trend. In Europe, the trend is consistent with the observation of increased 
  growth in individual stands noted by Spiecker <i>et al</i>. (1996). The FAO 
  statistics indicate that between the 1980s and 1990s both net annual increment 
  and timber fellings increased, but that the rate of change was lower for fellings 
  than for growth, resulting in a substantial increase in the carbon sink from 
  the 1980s to the 1990s (Kuusela, 1994; Kauppi <i>et al</i>., 1992; Sedjo, 1992; 
  Dixon <i>et al</i>., 1994; UN-ECE/FAO, 2000). The carbon sink in live woody 
  vegetation was on the order of 10% of the fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  in the USA and in western Europe, and higher in the 1990s than in the 1980s 
  (c.f. Kauppi <i>et al</i>., 1992). </p>
<p>These relatively high sequestration rates are not a result of active policies 
  aimed at climate mitigation, but less rather appear to be related to general 
  trends in land use and land-use change. In the USA, Schimel <i>et al</i>. (2000) 
  and Houghton <i>et al</i>. (1999) estimate that the observed sink is a result 
  mainly of changes in land use and land management, rather than a response to 
  changes in the environment. The latest observations, based on forest inventory 
  data (UN-ECE/FAO, 2000), are reflected in the Special Report on LULUCF (IPCC, 
  2000a). The IPCC (2000a) estimates that the total global terrestrial biopheric 
  sink in the 1990s amounted to 0.7GtC/yr, despite a source from land-use change 
  in the tropics of 0.9GtC/yr<br>
