<h3>5.3.1 Technological Innovation </h3>
<p>Many governments and firms have focused their strategies for GHG mitigation 
  on encouraging technological innovation &#150; various processes of research, 
  experimentation, learning, and technology development. Innovation may lead to 
  improvements in technology performance, reductions in GHG emissions per unit 
  of service provided, or reductions in cost for low-GHG technology, all of which 
  can contribute to GHG mitigation. Innovation can help to raise the technological, 
  socio-political, economic, and market potentials for adoption of low-GHG technology, 
  and for GHG mitigation. Identifying the barriers to, and opportunities for, 
  technological innovation depends on understanding the innovation process. Since 
  the IPCC SAR, there has been a rapid growth of interest in the theory of innovation, 
  and in the development and application of models to evaluate climate mitigation 
  policies that take account of endogenous technological change (Azar, 1996; Goulder 
  and Mathai, 2000).</p>
<h4><a name="5311"></a>5.3.1.1 The Innovation Process</h4>
<p>Until the 1980s, policy analysts generally viewed innovation as a linear process 
  from R&amp;D through to demonstration and deployment. Policies were focused 
  on &#147;science push&#148; and &#147;demand pull&#148; for new technologies 
  (OECD, 1992). Over the last twenty years there has been a growing recognition 
  of the interconnectedness of the many processes involved in technological change, 
  and the possibility of finding new insights or knowledge anywhere from the research 
  lab to the customer service department.</p>
<p>Technological change can take many different forms including: (1) incremental 
  improvements in existing technology; (2) radical innovation to introduce completely 
  new technology; (3) changes in a system of linked technologies, and (4) changes 
  in the &#147;techno-economic paradigm&#148; involving widespread re-organization 
  of production and consumption patterns (Freeman and Perez, 1988). These four 
  types of innovation have different dynamics. Thus, the first type is likely 
  to occur continually through the accumulation of experience, selection of successful 
  techniques and adaptation to a changing economic, legislative and socio-cultural 
  context. The second and third types of technological change involve more positive 
  creativity, being linked to new information in the form of a discovery, idea, 
  or invention; or to a creative application of an existing invention. The fourth 
  type, again, involves creativity but, because it involves a radical change in 
  culture and markets, may also depend on these being &#147;ripe&#148; for change 
  &#150; on a general perception of a major challenge requiring a radical response.</p>
<p>Technology diffusion, the spread of existing technology through the population 
  of potential users, can be distinguished from innovation &#150; the first commercial 
  application of a new technology. At a local level, however, there may be little 
  difference between the two. Wallace (1995) notes the importance of an active 
  and creative absorption process in the uptake of the new technology.</p>
<p>Technological change is a complex process. It occurs through a variety of interdependent 
  mechanisms (Nelson <i>et al</i>., 1967; Rosenberg, 1982; Dosi, 1988; OECD, 1992; Rosenberg, 
  1994; Lane and Maxfield, 1995), which can include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>assessment of needs and potential markets;</li>
  <li>basic research: a search for new information;</li>
  <li>creative generation of new ideas;</li>
  <li>learning from experience;</li>
  <li>exchange of new information, ideas, and experience through the scientific 
    and technical literature, patents, and a variety of other communication channels 
    and networks including face-to-face contact and collaboration;</li>
  <li>experimentation to implement and test the new information and ideas;</li>
  <li>development of new technology;</li>
  <li>demonstration and market testing of new technology; and</li>
  <li>selection of successful technology, under the influence of the economic, 
    social, legal, and physical context.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the complexity of the technological innovation process, there are 
  many different ways of looking at it. A variety of theories or models may be 
  helpful, depending partly on specific circumstances.</p>
<p>From the perspective of neoclassical economics, innovation can be seen as the 
  result of a process of investment in &#147;knowledge capital&#148;, in the form 
  of R&amp;D to develop both formal and tacit knowledge (Griliches, 1979). The 
  former includes the scientific literature and patents; the latter includes the 
  skills and experience developed by those involved in developing new technology 
  and can also be viewed as &#147;human capital&#148;. Increasing capital, again, 
  tends to feed into higher levels of economic output and improved efficiency. 
  Sometimes this may contribute to GHG mitigation, but more often the improvement 
  is in labour productivity, leading to increases in GHG emissions. In so-called 
  &#147;new growth&#148; theory economic models (e.g., Grossman and Helpman, 1991, 
  1993), new knowledge may be assumed to result directly from R&amp;D spending 
  which, in turn, can be modelled as a result of the expected returns from the 
  investment. In this framework, firms and research institutes are treated as 
  rational investors in R&amp;D. The size of their investment will depend on the 
  opportunity cost of capital and the expected return from R&amp;D. While new 
  growth theory has generated useful insights into the sources of national differences 
  in competitiveness at an aggregate or sectoral level, it is less useful for 
  describing technology innovation for GHG mitigation.</p>
<p>In addition to R&amp;D investment, knowledge capital can also be accumulated 
  through the process of &#147;learning by doing&#148; (Arthur, 1994; Grubb, 2000). 
  Empirical studies show that the cost of a generic technology such as solar photovoltaic 
  cells tends to fall with the level of existing investment in that technology, 
  including spending on R&amp;D (Christiansson, 1995; Messner, 1996; Nakicenovic, 
  1996). </p>
<p>An alternative to the neoclassical investment approach to innovation is that 
  pioneered by Nelson and Winter (1982), to view technological change from the 
  perspective of the firm, as a stochastic process of search, imitation, experimentation, 
  and learning (Winter <i>et al</i>., 2000). Recent developments in agent-based modelling 
  adopt this type of &#147;evolutionary&#148; framework, helping to bring out 
  the role of information networks, the importance of existing experience, and 
  also some of the spatial aspects of technology development and diffusion.</p>
<p>Finally, several analysts have adopted models of technology competition and 
  diffusion analogous to those used to represent species competition and diffusion 
  in ecosystems. Regularities have been found, for example, in the market succession 
  of technology in energy supply, transport, and the iron and steel industry (H&auml;fele 
  <i>et al</i>., 1982; Gr&uuml;bler and Nakicenovic, 1991; Nakicenovic, 1996). However, 
  no approach can hope to foresee reliably the form of the next &#147;wave&#148; 
  of technology in any of these sectors.</p>
