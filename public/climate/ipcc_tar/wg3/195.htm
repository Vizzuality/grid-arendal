<h4>5.3.6.1 Achievement of Economic Potential </h4>
<p><i>High transaction costs and inadequate property rights</i><b> </b><br>
  Substantial cost reductions may go unrealized when the transaction costs are 
  high. Attempts to reduce transaction costs and to clarify property rights may 
  yield substantial long-term gains. Uncertain property rights, especially as 
  far as intellectual property rights are concerned, act to increase discount 
  rates. Procurement routines which include energy consumption as a criterion, 
  and accounting procedures which are adapted to the polluter-pays principle may 
  need to be adopted to provide appropriate incentives for production units to 
  reduce energy consumption. Intellectual property rights encourage foreign investment, 
  but could also have a negative impact on the adaptation of existing technologies 
  to local conditions (Blackman, 1999).</p>
<p>Demonstration projects, advertising campaigns, testing and certification of 
  new technologies, subsidies to technological consulting services, and science 
  parks are ways for governments to enhance the flow of information on new technologies. 
  This information is bound to be imperfect, because firms have no incentive to 
  supply information about new technologies to late adopters, and technology suppliers 
  are more concerned about market share than about technology diffusion (Blackman, 
  1999).</p>
<p><i>Misplaced Incentives</i><b> </b><br>
  In some situations, the incentives of the agent charged with purchasing a product 
  or service are not aligned with those of the persons who would benefit from 
  higher efficiency. An example is in rental housing where the tenant is responsible 
  for the energy bill, so the landlord has little or no incentive to undertake 
  energy efficiency improvements or acquire more efficient equipment. Other examples 
  of misplaced incentives are present in contracts which pay fees to architects 
  and technical advisors that are measured as a percentage of total project investment, 
  and give rise to over-sizing and &#147;gold-plating&#148; without sufficient 
  attention to the (energy) performance of the investments. </p>
<p><i>Inefficient Labour Markets</i><b> </b><br>
  These may prevent the efficient movement of skilled workers among sectors. This 
  may slow technology diffusion and therefore growth (Aghion and Howitt, 1998).</p>
<p><i>Co-ordination Problems between Technology-producing Sectors</i><b> </b><br>
  Some technologies, dubbed &#147;general purpose technologies&#148; (or &#147;GPTs&#148;, 
  Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995), are characterized by much initial scope for 
  improvement, many varied uses, applicability across many diverse sectors, and 
  strong complementarities among the uses in different sectors (Helpman, 1998). 
  Development and diffusion of these technologies requires co-ordination between 
  the sector or sectors producing the GPT and the application sectors, because 
  rapid development of the GPT is dependent on improvements in the technologies 
  in the application sectors, and vice versa.</p>
<p><i>Policy Uncertainty</i><br>
  Climate change uncertainties inhibit desirable investment in new technologies 
  and long-term capital goods. The resulting uncertainty about energy prices, 
  especially in the short-term, seems to be an important barrier. Therefore, policy 
  uncertainty should not add to the incentive of holding off relatively irreversible 
  investments. Policy stability is a virtue and institutions are patterns of routinized 
  behaviour that stabilize perceptions, interpretations, and justifications (Giddens, 
  1984; O&#146;Riordan <i>et al</i>., 1998; Schmalensee, 1998). Lack of credibility of 
  technology forcing policy is a form of policy uncertainty as is illustrated 
  by the example of the 1970 US automobile emissions standards (<a href="#box52">Box 
  5.2</a>) (Rip and Kemp, 1998). Another form of policy uncertainty results from 
  a crisis by crisis government management style, or from the fact that issues 
  are sometimes championed by individuals and die off when these individuals leave 
  the political scene.</p>

    <td class="box"><b>Box 5.2. United States Automobile Emission Standards </b> 
      <p>Federal controls on US automotive air pollution (carbon monoxide, oxides 
        of hydrogen, and hydrocarbons), inspired by a technology forcing philosophy, 
        were first applied to 1968 model cars in the US. In the following years, 
        the standards were gradually made more stringent (White, 1982). The 1970 
        Clean Air Act imposed stringent nationally uniform emission limitations 
        on new motor vehicles requiring 90% reductions over uncontrolled emissions 
        by 1975-1976 with fines of up to US$10,000 per car and limited provision 
        for deadline extensions. The ambitious standards established proved to 
        be difficult to achieve. By 1976, it became clear that many air quality 
        areas were not going to meet the deadline for implementing the ambient 
        standards (Ashford <i>et al</i>., 1985). The deadlines for achieving 90% reduction 
        were repeatedly waived or statutorily postponed. The $10,000 fine was 
        not credible (Stewart, 1981). The Clean Air Act was amended in 1977, and 
        moved away from technology forcing by introducing market incentives such 
        as innovation waivers (Ashford <i>et al</i>., 1985). Empirical results show, 
        however, with very little ambiguity, significantly lower emissions from 
        vehicles for 1968 and after, especially for the years in which emissions 
        were tightened (White, 1982). Therefore, compliance was achieved despite 
        the fact that industry argued, or that compliance with the regulation 
        was doubtful or thought to be impossible. Rapid diffusion of add-on catalysts 
        and minor modifications to the standard combustion engine were achieved 
        but basic changes in engine technologies did not materialize. Uncertainty 
        about whether a deadline or a fine will be enforced gives the signal to 
        industry that a technology developed may ultimately not be needed, and 
        that adopting low-risk existing technologies i.e., technology diffusion 
        is the way to go (Stewart, 1981; Ashford <i>et al</i>., 1985).</p>
