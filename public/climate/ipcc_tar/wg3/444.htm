<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>In this context, an optimal baseline strategy is required that (first of all) 
  takes into account the high volume of projects that will be needed for the flexible 
  mechanisms to achieve their main objective of an (overall) environmental effectiveness. 
  The balance is likely to be achieved by optimizing baseline stringency and minimizing 
  project complexity (as long as the ability to determine &#147;what would have 
  happened otherwise&#148; is not compromised). The reasoning is that a higher 
  number of effective projects will be more beneficial for the environment (in 
  terms of GHG reductions) than a lower number of individually very effective 
  projects (OECD, 1999a). A related delicate balance should be reached between 
  the requirement for rigorous monitoring and reporting efforts (to ensure environmental 
  effectiveness) and the need to obtain cost-effective and predictable emission 
  benefits via simple procedures that encourage such projects (OECD, 1999b).</p>
<p>The next problem is that each implemented project&#151;especially a large one&#151;affects 
  the baseline in other parts of the economy. Jackson (1995) warns that this might 
  implicate a multilevel system of baselines in the overall economy, sectors, 
  and projects. Clearly, projects have to be monitored. Thus the political problem 
  of creating guidelines for monitoring and the technical issue of registration 
  arise. Furthermore, credible enforcement or penalization against cheating or 
  non-fulfilling parties needs to be established, probably in the form of a special 
  body for ascertainment (Janssen, 1999). A reliable basis of international law 
  for contracting is essential, especially among private actors. Even if all these 
  conditions are fulfilled, the problem of corruption might make the instrument 
  inefficient or flawed outright. With respect to such problems Barrett (1998) 
  raises the question whether the Kyoto Protocol will be implemented at all by 
  any parties if every party believes that other parties do not obey the rules 
  and follow their own commitments.</p>
<p>Turning to the second problem area, the efficient allocation of markets can 
  be distorted by transaction costs associated with searching for partners, and 
  the costs of contracting and negotiations (see Stavins, 1995). Price distortions 
  result when large nations and corporations exercise market power (Hahn, 1984; 
  Hagem and Westskog, 1998), or asymmetric information distribution between partners 
  in JI or CDM projects is exploited by one of them (Hagem, 1996). It is well 
  known that each of these deviations from the ideal world of competitive markets 
  might lead to inefficient allocations. Other factors at work include the initial 
  distribution of property rights, which might also reflect equity considerations.</p>
<p><i>Corruption and Other Host Internal Problems</i><br>
  Corruption is an important problem in several countries on both sides of the 
  JI and CDM relationships. The negative consequence of corruption is that institutional 
  settings are undermined, especially when hard currency is involved. In many 
  developing countries with weak democratic institutions, politicians have strong 
  incentives to maximize the financial flows and to ignore potential negative 
  consequences. Heller (1995) points out that higher financial inflows from donor 
  countries might result in shrinking domestic environmental budgets, so that 
  no real emissions reduction occurs.</p>
<p><i>Balance Between Domestic and International Strategies</i><br>
  It is apparent from this section that the relationship between domestic mitigation 
  and the use of international instruments remains an intricate one. Work by Hahn 
  and Stavins (1995) indicates that the link between domestic implementation and 
  international mechanisms may seriously limit the ultimate economic potential 
  of emissions trading. Most economic studies of trading assume that trade occurs 
  whenever there is the potential to lower compliance costs. However, to the extent 
  that some countries implement their domestic strategies through regulatory and 
  tax measures, emissions permits obtained through international transactions 
  may have limited or no value in these countries. Moreover, Hahn and Stavins 
  (1995) point out that domestic legislators may be concerned about the significant 
  financial transfers implied by emissions trading and act to keep funds within 
  their own borders. In another relationship, Montgomery (1997) raises the possibility 
  that domestic legislators may try to impose trade barriers in an effort to limit 
  the competitiveness consequence implied by the loss of capital and jobs that 
  may accompany efforts to limit emissions.</p>
<p>In summary, the literature on where-flexibility reveals abundant opportunities 
  to reduce the costs of emission reductions, but also raises concerns about the 
  implementation. However, concerns as to whether the flexibility mechanisms of 
  the Kyoto Protocol can be implemented because of the possibility that some parties 
  may be corrupt or may cheat are universal concerns. They apply not only to the 
  countries involved in flexibility mechanisms, but also to countries that take 
  on any emissions reduction commitments (although flexibility instruments are 
  particularly sensitive to cheating). Given the various ways proposed to reduce 
  the risks of their misuse, the Kyoto mechanisms offer the double advantage of 
  reducing the costs of climate change mitigation and fostering non-climate objectives 
  as well.</p>
