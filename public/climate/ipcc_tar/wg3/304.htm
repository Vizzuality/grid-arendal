<h2>7.5 Specific Development Stages and Mitigation Costs (Including Economies 
  in Transition) </h2>
<p>Developing countries and EITs exhibit a number of special characteristics that 
  should be reflected in mitigation cost studies. There is a need for further 
  development of the methodologies and approaches that reflect these issues; this 
  section introduces a number of distinct features for such economies and concludes 
  with a number of suggestions for the expansion of studies and methodology development.</p>
<h3><a name="751"></a>7.5.1 Why Developing Countries Have Special Problems in 
  Their Mitigation Strategies</h3>
<p>The term &#147;developing countries&#148; covers a wide variety of countries 
  with distinct differences in their economic, political, social, and technological 
  levels. The group of countries termed &#147;least developing countries&#148; 
  have very little basic infrastructure, the &#147;newly industrialized countries&#148; 
  have a structure closer to that of the developed countries, and others lie between 
  these two extremes. Almost all developing countries have a relatively low level 
  of GHG emissions per capita at present, but large countries like India, China, 
  and Brazil will soon become very important in terms of their contribution to 
  total global emissions. It is therefore important to understand how these countries 
  might participate in globally cost-effective policies. </p>
<p>Mitigation costs in a country depend critically on the underlying technological 
  and socioeconomic conditions. Studies that assess these costs make assumptions 
  about current and future socioeconomic development patterns and the potential 
  to implement climate change mitigation policies. Developing countries exhibit 
  a number of specific complexities that are of major importance to costing studies. 
  Data are limited, exchange processes are constrained, markets are incomplete, 
  and a number of broader social development issues are potentially important 
  for future GHG emissions, such as living conditions of the poor, gender issues, 
  and institutional capacity needs. Some of these difficulties arise particularly 
  in relation to land-use sectors, but can also be important in relation to the 
  energy sector and transportation. </p>
<p>To sum up, a number of special issues related to technology use should be considered 
  for developing countries as the critical determinants for their climate change 
  mitigation potential and related costs. These include current technological 
  development levels, technology transfer issues, capacity for innovation and 
  diffusion, barriers to efficient technology use, institutional structure, human 
  capacity aspects, and foreign exchange earnings. </p>
<p>The methodology of most current mitigation cost studies was developed on the 
  basis of approaches originally designed for the market-based economies of developed 
  countries. The application of these methodologies in a developing countries 
  context typically poses special problems relating to data, sectoral coverage, 
  activity projections, and assumptions about markets, behaviours, and policy 
  instruments. A simplified application of these methodologies in developing countries 
  can lead to a number of inaccuracies in mitigation studies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Major GHG emission sources and drivers for future emission can be overlooked. 
    This is especially relevant for the land-use sectors.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Mitigation studies may focus on specific technical options that are not 
    consistent with national macroeconomic policy contexts and broader social 
    and environmental policy priorities. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The technical potential of specific options, for example electricity saving 
    options, may be overestimated because consumer behaviour and power market 
    failures are not captured.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The impacts of using different policy instruments cannot be assessed because 
    the studies do not include any information on national institutional structure, 
    taxes, and other regulation policies and various technology promotion programmes.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Implementation issues, including institutional and human capacity aspects 
    and local market development, are not represented.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="752"></a>7.5.2 Why Economies in Transition (EIT) Have Special Problems 
  in Their Mitigation Strategies </h3>
<p>Estimating the costs of mitigation for EITs presents its own challenges, which 
  can be described as past, present, and future. In the recent past, prices were 
  not the rationing mechanism of choice. The listed prices (where there were any) 
  did not necessarily reflect the actual level of scarcity, since they were not 
  set by supply and demand. As such, data based on listed prices from which to 
  construct marginal abatement cost curves is sketchy at best, and completely 
  missing at worst. </p>
<p>Today, problems still exist in the construction of such curves, in that each 
  transition economy has its own unique mix of fee markets and state control. 
  The newer sources of data reflect a mix of price and quantity rationing that 
  needs to be better understood on a country-by-country basis. </p>
<p>Finally, using this data to estimate mitigation costs into the near or distant 
  future depends on critical assumptions about how the political, legal, and economic 
  institutions will evolve in these economies. Any estimates of mitigation costs 
  into the twenty-first century made under the assumption that current institutions 
  will be held constant are almost certainly not going to be correct. Hence, it 
  is essential to devote a good deal of effort to develop scenarios of evolution 
  for these institutions and their implications for economic development. </p>
