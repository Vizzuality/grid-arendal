<h2><a name="87"></a>8.7 &#147;Spillover&#148; Effects<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#19","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>19</a></sup></small> 
  from Actions Taken in Annex B on Non-Annex B Countries</h2>
<p>In a world where economies are linked by international trade and capital flows, 
  abatement of one economy will have welfare impacts on other abating or non-abating 
  economies. These impacts are called spillover effects, and include effects on 
  trade, carbon leakage, transfer and diffusion of environmentally sound technology, 
  and other issues (<a href="#figTS8">Figure TS.8</a>).</p>
<p>As to the trade effects, the dominant finding of the effects of emission constraints 
  in Annex B countries on non-Annex B countries in simulation studies prior to 
  the Kyoto Protocol was that Annex B abatement would have a predominantly adverse 
  impact on non-Annex B regions. In simulations of the Kyoto Protocol, the results 
  are more mixed with some non-Annex B regions experiencing welfare gains and 
  other losses. This is mainly due to a milder target in the Kyoto simulations 
  than in pre-Kyoto simulations. It was also universally found that most non-Annex 
  B economies that suffered welfare losses under uniform independent abatement 
  would suffer smaller welfare losses under emissions trading.<br>

<p><a name="figTS8"></a>A reduction in Annex B emissions will tend to result in 
  an increase in non-Annex B emissions reducing the environmental effectiveness 
  of Annex B abatement. This is called &#147;carbon leakage&#148;, and can occur 
  in the order of 5%-20% through a possible relocation of carbon-intensive industries 
  because of reduced Annex B competitiveness in the international marketplace, 
  lower producer prices of fossil fuels in the international market, and changes 
  in income due to better terms of trade.</p>
<p>While the SAR reported that there was a high variance in estimates of carbon 
  leakage from the available models, there has been some reduction in the variance 
  of estimates obtained in the subsequent years. However, this may largely result 
  from the development of new models based on reasonably similar assumptions and 
  data sources. Such developments do not necessarily reflect more widespread agreement 
  about appropriate behavioural assumptions. One robust result seems to be that 
  carbon leakage is an increasing function of the stringency of the abatement 
  strategy. This means that leakage may be a less serious problem under the Kyoto 
  target than under the more stringent targets considered previously. Also emission 
  leakage is lower under emissions trading than under independent abatement. Exemptions 
  for energy-intensive industries found in practice, and other factors, make the 
  higher model estimates for carbon leakage unlikely, but would raise aggregate 
  costs.</p>
<p>Carbon leakage may also be influenced by the assumed degree of competitiveness 
  in the world oil market. While most studies assume a competitive oil market, 
  studies considering imperfect competition find lower leakage if OPEC is able 
  to exercise a degree of market power over the supply of oil and therefore reduce 
  the fall in the international oil price. Whether or not OPEC acts as a cartel 
  can have a reasonably significant effect on the loss of wealth to OPEC and other 
  oil producers and on the level of permit prices in Annex B regions (see also 
  <a href="042.htm">Section 9.2</a>).</p>
<p>The third spillover effect mentioned above, the transfer and diffusion of environmentally 
  sound technology, is related to induced technical change (see <a href="040.htm#810">Section 
  8.10</a>). The transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how, 
  not included in models, may lead to lower leakage and especially on the longer 
  term may more than offset the leakage.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="88"></a>8.8 Summary of the Main Results for Kyoto Targets</h2>
<p>The cost estimates for Annex B countries to implement the Kyoto Protocol vary 
  between studies and regions, and depend strongly upon the assumptions regarding 
  the use of the Kyoto mechanisms, and their interactions with domestic measures. 
  The great majority of global studies reporting and comparing these costs use 
  international energy-economic models. Nine of these studies suggest the following 
  GDP impacts<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#20","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>20</a></sup></small>:</p>
<p><i>Annex II countries</i><small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#21","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>21</a></sup></small>: 
  In the absence of emissions trading between Annex B countries<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#22","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>22</a></sup></small>, 
  the majority of global studies show reductions in projected GDP of about 0.2% 
  to 2% in 2010 for different Annex II regions. With full emissions trading between 
  Annex B countries, the estimated reductions in 2010 are between 0.1% and 1.1% 
  of projected GDP<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#23","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>23</a></sup></small>. 
  These studies encompass a wide range of assumptions. Models whose results are 
  reported here assume full use of emissions trading without transaction cost. 
  Results for cases that do not allow Annex B trading assume full domestic trading 
  within each region. Models do not include sinks or non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse 
  gases. They do not include the CDM, negative cost options, ancillary benefits, 
  or targeted revenue recycling.</p>
<p>For all regions costs are also influenced by the following factors: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Constraints on the use of Annex B trading, high transaction costs in implementing 
    the mechanisms and inefficient domestic implementation could raise costs. 
  </li>
  <li>Inclusion in domestic policy and measures of the no regrets possibilities, 
    use of the CDM, sinks, and inclusion of non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases, 
    could lower costs. Costs for individual countries can vary more widely.</li>
</ul>
<p>The models show that the Kyoto mechanisms, are important in controlling risks 
  of high costs in given countries, and thus can complement domestic policy mechanisms. 
  Similarly, they can minimize risks of inequitable international impacts and 
  help to level marginal costs. The global modelling studies reported above show 
  national marginal costs to meet the Kyoto targets from about US$20/tC up to 
  US$600/tC without trading, and a range from about US$15/tC up to US$150/tC with 
  Annex B trading. The cost reductions from these mechanisms may depend on the 
  details of implementation, including the compatibility of domestic and international 
  mechanisms, constraints, and transaction costs.</p>
<p><i>Economies in transition</i>: For most of these countries, GDP effects range 
  from negligible to a several percent increase. This reflects opportunities for 
  energy efficiency improvements not available to Annex II countries. Under assumptions 
  of drastic energy efficiency improvement and/or continuing economic recessions 
  in some countries, the assigned amounts may exceed projected emissions in the 
  first commitment period. In this case, models show increased GDP through revenues 
  from trading assigned amounts. However, for some economies in transition, implementing 
  the Kyoto Protocol will have similar impacts on GDP as for Annex II countries. 
</p>
<p><i>Non-Annex I countries</i>: Emission constraints in Annex I countries have 
  well established, albeit varied &#147;spillover&#148; effects<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#24","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>24</a></sup></small> 
  on non-Annex I countries.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Oil-exporting, non-Annex I countries: Analyses report costs differently, 
    including, inter alia, reductions in projected GDP and reductions in projected 
    oil revenues<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#25","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>25</a></sup></small>. 
    The study reporting the lowest costs shows reductions of 0.2% of projected 
    GDP with no emissions trading, and less than 0.05% of projected GDP with Annex 
    B emissions trading in 2010<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#26","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>26</a></sup></small>. 
    The study reporting the highest costs shows reductions of 25% of projected 
    oil revenues with no emissions trading, and 13% of projected oil revenues 
    with Annex B emissions trading in 2010. These studies do not consider policies 
    and measures<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#27","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>27</a></sup></small> 
    other than Annex B emissions trading, that could lessen the impact on non-Annex 
    I, oil-exporting countries, and therefore tend to overstate both the costs 
    to these countries and overall costs. <br>
    The effects on these countries can be further reduced by removal of subsidies 
    for fossil fuels, energy tax restructuring according to carbon content, increased 
    use of natural gas, and diversification of the economies of non-Annex I, oil-exporting 
    countries.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Other non-Annex I countries: They may be adversely affected by reductions 
    in demand for their exports to OECD nations and by the price increase of those 
    carbon-intensive and other products they continue to import. These countries 
    may benefit from the reduction in fuel prices, increased exports of carbon-intensive 
    products and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how. 
    The net balance for a given country depends on which of these factors dominates. 
    Because of these complexities, the breakdown of winners and losers remains 
    uncertain. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Carbon leakage:<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#28","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>28</a></sup></small> 
    The possible relocation of some carbon-intensive industries to non-Annex I 
    countries and wider impacts on trade flows in response to changing prices 
    may lead to leakage in the order of 5-20%. Exemptions, for example for energy-intensive 
    industries, make the higher model estimates for carbon leakage unlikely, but 
    would raise aggregate costs. The transfer of environmentally sound technologies 
    and know-how, not included in models, may lead to lower leakage and especially 
    on the longer term may more than offset the leakage.</li>
