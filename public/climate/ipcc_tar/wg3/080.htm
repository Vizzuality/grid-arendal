<h2>2.5 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) and Post-SRES Mitigation 
  Scenarios</h2>
<p>This section reviews two scenario literatures. One is the SRES, which reports 
  on the development of multiple GHG emissions baselines based on different future 
  world views, and the other is the post-SRES literature, which involves the quantification 
  of mitigation scenarios based on the new SRES baseline scenarios.</p>

<h3>2.5.1 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios: Summary and Differences from 
  TAR</h3>
<a name="2511"></a> 
<h4>2.5.1.1 IPCC Emissions Scenarios and the SRES Process</h4>
<p>First, the reference scenarios are reviewed, namely the SRES GHG emissions 
  scenarios. These are &#147;reference&#148; scenarios in the sense that they 
  describe future emissions in the absence of specific new policies to mitigate 
  climate change. The new scenarios are published as the Special Report on Emissions 
  Scenarios (SRES) by the IPCC (Nakicenovic <i>et al.</i>, 2000).</p>
<p>A key feature of the SRES process was that different methodological approaches 
  and models were used to develop the scenarios. Another was that an &#147;open 
  process&#148; was used to develop the scenarios through which researchers and 
  other interest groups throughout the world could review and comment on the SRES 
  scenarios as they were being developed. The SRES also aimed at improving the 
  process of scenario development by extensively documenting the inputs and assumptions 
  of the SRES scenarios; by formulating narrative scenario storylines; by encouraging 
  a diversity of approaches and methods for deriving scenarios; by making the 
  scenarios from different groups more comparable, and by assessing their differences 
  and similarities; by expanding the range of economic-development pathways, including 
  a narrowing of the income gap between developing and industrially developed 
  countries; by incorporating the latest information on economic restructuring 
  throughout the world; and by examining different trends in and rates of technological 
  change.</p>

<p>The basic approach of the SRES writing team was to construct scenarios that 
  were both qualitative and quantitative. The process involved first the formulation 
  of the qualitative scenario characteristics in the form of narrative storylines 
  and then their quantification by six different modelling approaches. The qualitative 
  description gives background information about the global setting of the scenarios, 
  which can be used to assess the capability of society to adapt to and mitigate 
  climate change, and for linking the emission scenarios with DES issues. The 
  quantitative description of emission scenarios can be used as input to models 
  for computing the future extent of climate change, and for assessing strategies 
  to reduce emissions. </p>
<p>The relation between qualitative and quantitative scenarios can be characterized 
  in terms of <a href="#fig210">Figure 2.10</a>.</p>
<p>The SRES writing team developed four scenario &#147;families&#148; (see <a href="#box25">Box 
  2.5</a> for an explanation of terminology used in the SRES), because an even 
  number helps to avoid the impression that there is a &#147;central&#148; or 
  &#147;most likely&#148; case. The scenarios cover a wide range &#150; but not 
  all possible futures. In particular, there are no &#147;global disaster&#148; 
  scenarios. None of the scenarios include new explicit climate policies.</p>
<p>Each family has a unifying theme in the form of a &#147;storyline&#148; or 
  narrative that describes future demographic, social, economic, technological, 
  and policy trends. Four storylines were developed by the whole writing team 
  that identified driving forces, key uncertainties, possible scenario families, 
  and their logic. Six global modelling teams then quantified the storylines. 
  The quantification consisted of first translating the storylines into a set 
  of quantitative assumptions about the driving forces of emissions (for example, 
  rates of change of population and size of the economy and rates of technological 
  change). Next, these assumptions were input to six integrated, global models 
  that computed the emissions of GHGs and sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). As 
  a result, a total of 40 scenarios were produced for the four storylines. The 
  large number of alternative scenarios showed that a single storyline could lead 
  to a large number of feasible emission pathways. </p>
<p>In all, six models were used to generate the 40 scenarios that comprise the 
  four scenario families. Six of these scenarios, which should be considered equally 
  sound, were chosen to illustrate the whole set of scenarios. They span a wide 
  range of uncertainty, as required by the SRES Terms of Reference. These encompass 
  four combinations of demographic change, social and economic development, and 
  broad technological developments, corresponding to the four families (A1, A2, 
  B1, B2), each with an illustrative &#147;marker&#148; scenario. Two of the scenario 
  groups of the A1 family (A1FI, A1T) explicitly explore energy technology developments, 
  alternative to the &#147;balanced&#148; A1B group, holding the other driving 
  forces constant, each with an illustrative scenario. Rapid growth leads to high 
  capital turnover rates, which means that early small differences among scenarios 
  can lead to a large divergence by 2100. Therefore, the A1 family, which has 
  the highest rates of technological change and economic development, was selected 
  to show this effect.</p>
<p>To provide a scientific foundation for the scenarios, the writing team extensively 
  reviewed and evaluated over 400 published scenarios. Results of the review were 
  published in the scientific literature (Alcamo and Nakicenovic, 1998), and made 
  available to the scientific community in the form of an Internet scenario database. 
  The background research by the six modelling teams for developing the 40 scenarios 
  was also published in the scientific literature (Nakicenovic, 2000).</p>

        2000)</b></p>
      <p><b>Model:</b> a formal representation of a system that allows quantification 
        of relevant system variables.<br>
        <b>Storyline:</b> a narrative description of a scenario (or a family of 
        scenarios) highlighting the main scenario characteristics, relationships 
        between key driving forces, and the dynamics of the scenarios.<br>
        <b>Scenario:</b> a description of a potential future, based on a clear 
        logic and a quantified storyline.<br>
        <b>Family:</b> scenarios that have a similar demographic, societal, economic, 
        and technical-change storyline. Four scenario families comprise the SRES: 
        A1, A2, B1, and B2.<br>
        <b>Group:</b> scenarios within a family that reflect a variation of the 
        storyline. The A1 scenario family includes three groups designated by 
        A1T, A1FI, and A1B that explore alternative structures of future energy 
        systems. The other three scenario families consist of one group each.<br>
        <b>Category:</b> scenarios are grouped into four categories of cumulative 
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between 1990 and 2100: low, medium&#150;low, 
        medium&#150;high, and high emissions. Each category contains scenarios 
        with a range of different driving forces yet similar cumulative emissions.<br>
        <b>Marker:</b> a scenario that was originally posted on the SRES website 
        to represent a given scenario family. A marker is not necessarily the 
        median or mean scenario.<br>
        <b>Illustrative: </b>a scenario that is illustrative for each of the six 
        scenario groups reflected in the Summary for Policymakers of this report. 
        They include four revised &#147;scenario markers&#148; for the scenario 
        groups A1B, A2, B1, and B2, and two additional illustrative scenarios 
        for the A1FI and AIT groups. See also &#147;(Scenario) Groups&#148; and 
        &#147;(Scenario) Markers&#148;.<br>
        <b>Harmonized:</b> harmonized scenarios within a family share common assumptions 
        for global population and GDP while fully harmonized scenarios are within 
        5% of the population projections specified for the respective marker scenario, 
        within 10% of the GDP and within 10% of the marker scenario&#146;s final 
        energy consumption.<br>
        <b>Standardized:</b> emissions for 1990 and 2000 are indexed to have the 
        same values.<br>
        <b>Other scenarios:</b> scenarios that are not harmonized.<br>
