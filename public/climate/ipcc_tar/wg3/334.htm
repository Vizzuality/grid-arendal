<h3>8.2.4 Ancillary Benefits </h3>
<p>&#147;Co-benefits&#148;<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#4","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>4</sup></small></a> 
  are the benefits from policy options implemented for various reasons at the 
  same time, acknowledging that most policies resulting in GHG mitigation also 
  have other, often at least equally important, rationales. &#147;Ancillary benefits&#148; 
  are the monetized secondary, or side benefits of mitigation policies on problems 
  such as reductions in local air pollution associated with the reduction of fossil 
  fuels, and possibly indirect effects on congestion, land quality, employment, 
  and fuel security. These are sometimes referred to as &#147;ancillary impacts&#148; 
  to reflect that these impacts may be either positive or negative. <a href="#fig8-8">Figure 
  8.8</a> shows the conceptual framework for analyzing ancillary and co-benefits 
  and costs. The figure shows that climate and social/environmental benefits can 
  be direct benefits, ancillary benefits, or co-benefits, depending on the objectives 
  of the policies. <a name="fig8-8"></a></p>

<p>The term co-benefits is used in this report despite its limited literature 
  because it shows the case for an integrated approach, linking climate change 
  mitigation to the achievement of sustainable development. However, there appear 
  to be three classes of literature regarding the impacts of climate change mitigation: 
  (1) literature that primarily looks at climate change mitigation, but that recognizes 
  there may be benefits in other areas (illustrated in the top panel of <a href="#fig8-8">Figure 
  8.8</a>); (2) literature that primarily focuses on other areas, such as air 
  pollution mitigation, and recognizes there may be &#147;ancillary benefits&#148; 
  in the area of climate mitigation (illustrated in the centre panel of <a href="#fig8-8">Figure 
  8.8</a>), (3) literature that looks at the combination of policy objectives 
  and examines the costs and benefits from an integrated perspective (illustrated 
  in the bottom panel of <a href="#fig8-8">Figure 8.8</a>). In this report, the 
  term &#147;co-benefits&#148; is used when speaking generically about this latter 
  perspective and when reviewing class (3) literature. The term &#147;ancillary 
  benefits&#148; is used when addressing class (1) and (2) literature. This section 
  covers primarily class (1) literature, which is the most extensive.</p>
<p>Very few economic modelling studies that examine the impacts on economic welfare 
  of various GHG abatement policies explicitly consider their ancillary consequences, 
  <i>i.e.</i> effects which would not have occurred in the absence of specific 
  GHG policies. These range from public health benefits through reduced air pollution 
  to reduced CH<sub>4</sub> from animal farms, and through impacts on biodiversity, 
  materials, or land use (see Rothman, 2000).</p>
<p>Existing studies provide evaluations of net ancillary benefits ranging from 
  a small fraction of GHG mitigation costs to more than offsetting them (see Burtraw 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1999, and reviews by Pearce, 2000; Burtraw and Toman, 1997; and 
  Ekins, 1996). Such variation in estimates is not surprising because the underlying 
  features differ by sectors considered and the geographic area being studied; 
  but this variation also reflects the lack of agreement on the definition, reach, 
  and size of these impacts and on the methodologies to estimate them. This literature 
  is growing, particularly with respect to the impacts on public health<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#5","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>5</a>, <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>6</a></sup></small>
, 
  so a critical review of it is given in this section. Most of the studies reviewed 
  focus on public health, which is the largest quantifiable impact; therefore 
  this assessment also focuses on it. Ancillary impacts to specific economic sectors 
  are reviewed in <a href="353.htm">Chapter 9.</a></p>
<p>Most of the key ancillary benefits quantified to date are relatively short 
  term and &#145;local&#146;, that is affecting the communities relatively close 
  to the sources of the emissions changes. In both these respects ancillary benefits 
  can be thought of as offsetting all or part of the welfare losses associated 
  with the costs of reducing GHGs. In this regard the best measure of ancillary 
  impacts may be the percentage (or absolute) variation in welfare loss from considering 
  a carbon tax (or other instrument) that does not include direct climate-mitigation 
  benefits. Few studies provide such estimates (Dessus and O&#146;Connor (1999), 
  is an exception).</p>
<p>Other metrics in the literature help to shed light on the size and uncertainty 
  associated with ancillary impacts estimates. The first normalizes ancillary 
  benefits with carbon reductions, that is, ancillary benefits per tonne of carbon 
  reduced (e.g., Burtraw <i>et al., </i>1999). The second is the average ancillary 
  benefits per tonne as a fraction of the carbon tax. This latter measure is useful 
  because it has some linkage to the net benefits question. Private marginal carbon 
  mitigation costs are equalized to the tax in the models in the literature. Given 
  that average mitigation costs are less than (or equal to) marginal costs, if 
  the metric equals more than one then the carbon policy modelled has net private 
  benefits even without counting the direct climate benefits. If (average) ancillary 
  benefits are lower than private marginal costs no claim for net benefits can 
  be made. However, the lower the fraction, the less likely the policy will have 
  net benefits. </p>
<p>A few important caveats are, however, in order. The most important is that 
  the relevant cost measure in the above fraction is <i>social</i> not <i>private</i> 
  cost. In this case, marginal <i>social</i> costs are likely to exceed marginal 
  <i>private</i> costs because of tax interaction effects. Thus, ancillary benefits 
  may not exceed social marginal cost even if the former exceeds<i> private</i> 
  marginal cost (equal to the carbon tax). Second, ancillary benefit (cost) measures 
  need to measure social welfare gains (or losses) if they are to be comparable 
  to losses on the mitigation side. But, many measures of ancillary benefits understate 
  social welfare gains and other benefits remain unmonetized or even unquantified, 
  while in other cases, the ancillary benefits overstate welfare gains (say by 
  counting all traffic fatality reductions as external benefits). Thus, <i>reported</i> 
  ancillary benefits can under- or overstate actual ancillary benefits. If this 
  indicator is greater than one, then the carbon policy has net private benefits 
  even without counting the direct climate benefits.</p>
<p>The section reviews some of the recent studies estimating ancillary benefits 
  of GHG mitigation policies. The studies are briefly described and examined for 
  the credibility of their methods and estimates.<br>
