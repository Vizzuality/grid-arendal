<h2><a name="46"></a>4.6 Market and Non-market Options to Enhance, Maintain, and 
  Manage Carbon Pools </h2>
<h3><a name="461"></a>4.6.1. Introduction, Taxes, and Quotas</h3>
<p>There are a host of market and non-market options to manage carbon pools in 
  the terrestrial biosphere. Some of the most relevant questions related to carbon 
  sequestration deal with the types of instruments, policies, and mechanisms that 
  could play a role in promoting increased sequestration and how the various arrangements 
  would actually affect outcomes. Market mechanisms could be important in promoting 
  or discouraging carbon sequestration. Potential mechanisms might include taxes 
  or subsidies for activities that affect carbon directly or that affect activities 
  with large carbon implications. The UK, for example, has proposed a &#147;Climate 
  Change Levy&#148; to be adopted by the UK&#146;s 2001 Budget. The Kyoto Protocol 
  introduces flexible mechanisms allowing joint implementation, emissions trading, 
  and the clean development mechanism. When dealing with terrestrial systems any 
  policies that influence land use can affect carbon sequestration. Finally, there 
  is the question of how the various instruments and policies are likely to influence 
  leakage of carbon flows outside the targetted system.</p>
<p>Agricultural subsidies are common in many, if not most, countries. Agricultural 
  subsidies and absent forestry subsidy policies can often be viewed as discouraging 
  forest production and thus, inadvertently, discouraging some possibilities for 
  carbon sequestration. Similarly, tax policies can promote or discourage certain 
  types of land use. In some countries, however, subsidies do promote afforestation 
  and reforestation. The movement of land from agriculture to forests generally 
  leads to gains in the forest sector and losses in the agricultural sector. The 
  cost of any additional carbon storage can involve a change in welfare across 
  two sectors. Lower taxes for agricultural lands and subsidies for forest clearing 
  may be part of the package of instruments to promote development. </p>
<p>To reach objectives for carbon sequestration, market mechanisms are important, 
  but an appropriate institutional setting is also useful. In some tropical countries 
  the profitability of maintaining forests could be improved in order to prevent 
  conversion to alternative uses of the land. Success could entail revising policies 
  that directly or indirectly subsidize cattle ranching (as has been historically 
  the case in Latin America) or agriculture. Success in C sequestration could 
  also entail technical and financial training and capacity building at the local 
  level. It should be recognized, however, that in many tropical countries, particularly 
  within Asia and Africa, forests are harvested and used according to the subsistence 
  needs of local communities. In these cases, some have argued that approaches 
  based on market mechanisms will not be effective. Also, non-timber forest products 
  are an important component of the total demand for forest products and could 
  be considered. </p>
<p>It is clear that some measures aimed at sequestering C in the biosphere have 
  relatively low cost compared to other approaches for mitigating the atmospheric 
  increase of CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href="171.htm">Section 4.5</a>). However, to 
  date only a small number of projects involving a small and varied group of stakeholders 
  has been initiated in the terrestrial biosphere. These projects (forest expansion, 
  forest management, soil carbon management, community forestry, and agroforestry) 
  have covered, worldwide, an area of 3.6 to 6.4 million hectares in 1999 (for 
  an overview see Brown <i>et al</i>., 2000). Incentives that would create projects aimed 
  at carbon sequestration in the biosphere on a large scale are not yet in place. 
</p>
<p>An important change in motivating carbon sequestration has been the creation 
  of the Kyoto Protocol, in December 1997. Although few countries have yet to 
  ratify the Kyoto Protocol, it introduces ceilings and/or quotas for CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions for Annex B countries. In addition, the Kyoto Protocol explicitly 
  recognizes afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation (ARD) as having carbon 
  implications, and it provides credits (and debits) for these activities in meeting 
  carbon-emissions targets. This arrangement has contributed to pressures to find 
  ways to give sequestered carbon value in the market place. A detailed explanation 
  of how the Kyoto Protocol might influence management of C stocks is given in 
  the IPCC Special Report on LULUCF (IPCC, 2000a). </p>
<p>Through setting emissions targets and introducing taxes on CO<sub>2</sub> emission 
  in some countries, carbon gains monetary value and could become a new product 
  for the forestry sector. From existing emissions taxes this value is estimated 
  at US$200/tCO<sub>2</sub> in Norway and US$100/tCO<sub>2</sub> in the Netherlands 
  (Solberg, 1997; Nabuurs, 1998). In the case of the Netherlands, this carbon 
  value is equivalent to US$17.5/m<sup>3</sup> of roundwood, more than the stumpage value 
  of wood as a raw material. However, in the first trades of certified carbon 
  credits, Moura-Costa and Stuart (1998) found that prices ranged between US$5&#150;US$10/tC. 
  More generally, Moura-Costa and Stuart (1998) found that the average price for 
  carbon credits for carbon sequestered in developing countries ranged from US$0.19 
  to US$12/tC, and that these differences are very much linked to uncertainty 
  about long term policy.<br>
  <br>
  The Dutch Government is considering the introduction of CO<sub>2</sub> certificates 
  as part of a test of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions trading. In this system, each 
  economic sector and each firm could achieve its targets partly through certificates. 
  Funds generated from these certificates would be used to establish forests.</p>
