<h4>7.3.3.2 Ancillary Impacts </h4>
<p>The definition of ancillary impacts is given in <a href="273.htm">Section 7.2.2.3</a>. 
  As noted there, these can be positive as well as negative. It is important to 
  recognize that gross and net mitigation costs cannot be established as a simple 
  summation of positive and negative impacts, because the latter are interlinked 
  in a very complex way. Climate change mitigation costs (gross and well as net 
  costs) are only valid in relation to a comprehensive specific scenario and policy 
  assumption structure. </p>
<p>An example is transportation sector options that have an impact on both GHG 
  emissions and urban air pollution control programmes. GHG emission control policies, 
  like vehicle maintenance programmes, reduce both GHG emissions and other pollution, 
  but another option, like the introduction of diesel trucks as a substitute for 
  gasoline trucks, decreases GHG emissions but increases NO<sub>x</sub> emissions 
  and thereby local air pollution. The gross and net costs assessed for these 
  programmes depend on specific baseline and policy case scenarios (specifically, 
  the assumptions on urban air pollution control policies are critical).</p>
<p>It is important that assumptions about environmental control policies outside 
  the specific area of GHG emissions reduction be carefully specified in relation 
  to the baseline as well as to the policy case. If the baseline assumes that 
  some environmental control policies are implemented in the time frame considered, 
  the side effects of the GHG reduction policy in relation to these areas cover 
  part of these environmental policy objectives. The mitigation costs then eventually 
  offset part of the control cost in the baseline case. However, if the baseline 
  case includes specific flue-gas cleaning systems on power plants to control 
  SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions that are already installed, then 
  investments in these plants are irreversible. In this case, the joint benefit 
  of climate change mitigation programmes in the form of avoided control cost 
  on the other emissions is low, while the public health ancillary benefits may 
  be substantial (see also the discussion on ancillary and/or co-benefits in <a href="271.htm#722">Section 
  7.2.2</a>).</p>
<h4><a name="7333"></a>7.3.3.3 Technological Development and Efficiency Impacts</h4>
<p>Assumptions about technological development and efficiency in the baseline 
  and mitigation scenarios have a major impact on mitigation costs, in particular 
  in bottom-up mitigation cost studies. Many of these studies structure the cost 
  assessment around an estimation of the costs and other impacts of introducing 
  technological options that imply lower GHG emissions. The existence and magnitude 
  of a potential for technological efficiency improvements depends on expectations 
  about technology innovation and penetration rates given consumer behaviour and 
  relative prices. These assumptions are discussed in more detail in <a href="291.htm">Section 
  7.3.4</a>. </p>
<p>A number of cost studies assessed different parts of the three above-mentioned 
  side effects. The double dividend is assessed predominantly in macroeconomic 
  studies on the basis of fairly detailed modelling representation of tax systems 
  and specific labour market constraints that cover the short-to-medium term time 
  horizon. Joint environmental impacts of climate change mitigation policies are 
  examined in various studies, including macroeconomic studies, sectoral studies, 
  and technology-specific engineering studies. Impacts of technological development 
  and efficiency are basically addressed in all sorts of studies, sometimes explicitly 
  but sometimes implicitly. The lack of an integrated treatment of all three issues 
  is,<i> inter alia</i>, a consequence of the different approaches to the technology 
  characterisation in top-down models (macroeconomic) and bottom-up models (technology- 
  or policy-specific models), which are further explained and discussed in <a href="309.htm">Section 
  7.6</a>. A few studies exist, however, that attempt such an integration (see, 
  e.g., Walz, 1999).</p>
