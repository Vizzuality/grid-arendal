<p><i>Willingness to Accept Deeper Reduction Goals</i><br>
  This argument is related to the reduction of the overall cost of compliance. 
  If the reduction costs are lowered by the use of international mechanisms, then 
  the nations might be willing to accept deeper GHG-reduction commitments. This 
  argument does not hold in countries with potential hot air when a country&#146;s 
  baseline (or projected future) emission is expected to be lower than its entitlement, 
  so that a marketable good (emission permit) is created without the need for 
  any effective reduction effort whatsoever. Nevertheless, members of the so-called 
  &#147;umbrella group&#148;, including the USA, Japan, Australia, Russia, and 
  others, have made it clear that the level of commitment they accepted in Kyoto 
  was contingent on the unfettered use of flexible mechanisms. In this sense they 
  have already incorporated the willingness to accept deeper emission reductions 
  in their existing commitments for the first budget period.</p>
<p><i>Complementarity to Other Goals</i><br>
  By using CDM and/or JI, climate protection can serve other goals such as accelerating 
  socioeconomic and technological development, reducing regional and local pollution, 
  and fostering integration and international understanding (Sun Rich, 1996). 
  (See <a href="048.htm">Chapter 1</a> for an extensive discussion of climate 
  change in the context of sustainable development and <a href="409.htm">Section 
  10.3</a> above on linkages to other issues and international agreements.)</p>
<p><i>Motivation for Private Institutions</i><br>
  Under JI and CDM, private institutions, such as enterprises and NGOs, are likely 
  to be engaged, with the bulk of reduction measures probably taking place in 
  the private sector. This might lead to a further reduction of mitigation costs, 
  because private institutions tend to operate at higher efficiency than state 
  bureaucracies do.</p>
<p><i>Technology Transfer</i><br>
  JI or CDM is often only possible if technology is transferred from rich and 
  energy-efficient regions to poor and energy-inefficient countries. This might 
  have the favourable effect that developing countries &#147;leap-frog&#148; over 
  the inefficient development stages previously passed through by the developed 
  countries.</p>
<p><i>Domestic versus International Strategies</i><br>
  Arguments to support a domestic strategy are often formulated as a critique 
  to an international strategy. Some general criticisms focus on the question 
  whether or not an international strategy is an adequate instrument to achieve 
  the ultimate goal of the UNFCCC, that is stabilizing the GHG concentration. 
  Bush and Harvey (1997) emphasize two key requirements: to sharply constrain 
  GHG emissions in developing countries and to achieve significant GHG reduction 
  in developed countries. The most frequent arguments in support of the domestic 
  strategy entail the following.</p>
<p><i>Dynamic Efficiency</i><br>
  Technological and social innovation are dynamic processes that can be accelerated 
  through pressure from commitments in the Kyoto Protocol. The international strategy 
  allows developed countries to lower this pressure and, as a result, less innovation 
  would occur. Instead of innovation, inefficient technology would be exported 
  to developing countries. This argument is strongly related to the endogenous 
  growth argument. The problem from the scientific point of view is that so far 
  no model with Learning by Doing (LBD) includes regional disaggregation and trade.</p>
<p><i>Missing No Regrets Options</i><br>
  This argument is related to the political, social, and economic barriers to 
  making use of no regrets potentials in developed countries. The possibility 
  to fulfil their commitments by using CDM and/or JI might be more favourable 
  for developed countries than to explore and utilize no regrets opportunities. 
  The potential of no-regrets in developing countries affects the principle of 
  additionality and is therefore a problem in accepting CDM and JI projects (Rentz, 
  1998).</p>
<p><i>Implementation</i><br>
  This argument embraces two problem areas: implementation of an institutional 
  framework for instruments at the national and international levels, and compliance 
  with the Kyoto Protocol targets. On the institutional side, there are several 
  impediments to building a strong regime for functional international instruments. 
  These are related to both institutional problems and market imperfections.</p>
<p>The production character of CDM and JI requires a fixed baseline to be defined. 
  The baseline provides an incentive to cheat by setting it unrealistically high 
  so that the efficacy of the instrument decreases because no real reduction takes 
  place. The possibility to cheat stems from the intricacies of fixing the baseline, 
  which usually arise through vague guidelines (political issue) and the general 
  problems of forecasting (technical issue; see Michaelowa, (1995; 1998b). Begg 
  <i>et al</i>. (1999) and Parkinson <i>et al</i>. (2001) examine the uncertainty associated 
  with baseline construction and propose it be managed through conservative esimates, 
  use of monitored data and verification, and either baseline revision or limited 
  crediting lifetimes. Parson and Fisher-Vanden (1999) argue that the opportunity 
  for self-serving manipulation of project baselines will vary markedly among 
  project types, and suggest a likely bias in any project-based JI system (such 
  as the CDM) towards project types most resistant to baseline manipulation&#151;retrofits 
  and technological carbon management. They also propose a hybrid domestic&#150;international 
  system for project certification to limit the scope for cheating.</p>
