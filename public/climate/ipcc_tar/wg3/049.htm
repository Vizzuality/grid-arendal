<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>This chapter places climate change mitigation, mitigation policy, and the contents 
  of the rest of the report in the broader context of development, equity, and 
  sustainability. This context reflects the explicit conditions and principles 
  laid down by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on the pursuit 
  of the ultimate objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations. The 
  UNFCCC imposes three conditions on the goal of stabilization, namely, that it 
  should take place within a time-frame sufficient to &#147;allow ecosystems to 
  adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened 
  and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner&#148; 
  (Art. 2). It also specifies several principles to guide this process: equity, 
  common but differentiated responsibilities, precaution, cost-effective measures, 
  right to sustainable development, and support for an open international economic 
  system (Art. 3). </p>
<p>Previous IPCC assessment reports sought to facilitate this pursuit by comprehensively 
  describing, cataloguing and comparing technologies and policy instruments that 
  could be used to achieve mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective 
  and efficient manner. The present assessment advances this process by including 
  recent analyses of climate change that place policy evaluations in the context 
  of sustainable development. This expansion of scope is consistent both with 
  the evolution of the literature on climate change and importance accorded by 
  the UNFCCC to sustainable development - including the recognition that &#147;Parties 
  have a right to, and should promote sustainable development&#148; (Art. 3.4). 
  It therefore goes some way towards filling the gaps in earlier assessments.</p>
<p>Climate Change involves complex interactions between climatic, environmental, 
  economic, political, institutional, social, and technological processes. It 
  cannot be addressed or comprehended in isolation from broader societal goals 
  (such as sustainable development), or other existing or probable future sources 
  of stress. In keeping with this complexity, a multiplicity of approaches have 
  emerged to analyze climate change and related challenges. Many of these incorporate 
  concerns about development, equity, and sustainability (albeit partially and 
  gradually) into their framework and recommendations. Each approach emphasizes 
  certain elements of the problem, and focuses on certain classes of responses, 
  including for example, optimal policy design, building capacity for designing 
  and implementing policies, strengthening synergies between climate change mitigation 
  and/or adaptation and other societal goals, and policies to enhance societal 
  learning. These approaches are therefore complementary rather than mutually 
  exclusive. <br>
  <br>
  This chapter brings together three broad classes of analysis, which differ not 
  so much in terms of their ultimate goals as in their points of departure and 
  preferred analytical tools. The three approaches start with concerns, respectively, 
  about efficiency and cost-effectiveness, equity and sustainable development, 
  and global sustainability and societal learning. The difference between the 
  three approaches we have selected lies in their starting point, not in their 
  ultimate goals. Regardless of the starting point of the analysis, many studies 
  try in their own way to incorporate other concerns. For example, many analyses 
  that approach climate change mitigation from a cost-effectiveness perspective 
  try to bring in considerations of equity and sustainability through their treatment 
  of costs, benefits, and welfare. Similarly, the class of studies motivated strongly 
  by considerations of inter-country equity tend to argue that equity is needed 
  to ensure that developing countries can pursue their internal goals of sustainable 
  development&#150;a concept that includes the implicit components of sustainability 
  and efficiency. Likewise, analysts focused on concerns of global sustainability 
  have been compelled by their own logic to make a case for global efficiency&#150;often 
  modelled as the decoupling of production from material flows&#150;and social 
  equity. In other words, each of the three perspectives has led writers to search 
  for ways to incorporate concerns that lie beyond their initial starting point. 
  All three classes of analyses look at the relationship of climate change mitigation 
  with all three goals&#150;development, equity, and sustainability&#150;albeit 
  in different and often highly complementary ways. Nevertheless, they frame the 
  issues differently, focus on different sets of causal relationships, use different 
  tools of analysis, and often come to somewhat different conclusions. </p>
<p>There is no presumption that any particular perspective for analysis is most 
  appropriate at any level. Moreover, the three perspectives are viewed here as 
  being highly synergistic. The important changes have been primarily in the types 
  of questions being asked and the kinds of information being sought. In practice, 
  the literature has expanded to add new issues and new tools, subsuming rather 
  than discarding the analyses included in the other ones. The range and scope 
  of climate policy analyses can be understood as a gradual broadening of the 
  types and extent of uncertainties that analysts have been willing and able to 
  address. <br>
  <br>
  The first perspective on climate policy considered is Cost-effectiveness. It 
  represents a perspective that is well represented in conventional climate policy 
  analysis and in the First through Third Assessments. These analyses have generally 
  been driven directly or indirectly by the question of what the most cost-effective 
  amount of mitigation for the global economy is, starting from a particular baseline 
  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenario, reflecting a specific set of socioeconomic 
  scenarios. Within this framework, important issues include measuring the performance 
  of various technologies and the removal of barriers (such as existing subsidies) 
  to the implementation of those candidate policies most likely to contribute 
  to emissions reductions. In a sense, the focus of analysis here has been on 
  identifying an efficient pathway through the interactions of mitigation policies 
  and economic development, conditioned by considerations of equity and sustainability, 
  but not primarily guided by them. At this level, policy analysis has almost 
  always taken the existing institutions and tastes of individuals as given; assumptions 
  that might be valid for a decade or two, but may become more questionable over 
  many decades.</p>
<p>The impetus for the expansion in the scope of the climate policy analysis and 
  discourse to include Equity considerations was to include considerations not 
  simply of the impacts of climate change and mitigation policies on global welfare 
  as a whole, but also of the effects of climate change and mitigation policies 
  on existing inequalities among and within nations. The literature on equity 
  and climate change has advanced considerably over the last two decades, but 
  there is no consensus on what constitutes fairness. Once equity issues were 
  introduced into the assessment agenda, though, they became important components 
  in defining the search for efficient emissions mitigation pathways. The considerable 
  literature that indicated how environmental policies could be hampered or even 
  blocked by those who considered them unfair became relevant. In the light of 
  these results, it became clear how and why any widespread perception that a 
  mitigation strategy is unfair would likely engender opposition to that strategy, 
  perhaps to the extent of rendering it non-optimal. Some cost-effectiveness analyses 
  had, in fact, laid the groundwork for applying this literature by demonstrating 
  the sensitivity of some equity measures to policy design, national perspective, 
  and regional context. Indeed, cost-effectiveness analyses had even highlighted 
  similar sensitivities for other measures of development and sustainability.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the analyses that start from equity concerns have by and large 
  focused on the needs of developing countries, and, in particular, on the commitment 
  expressed in Article 3.4 of the UNFCCC to the pursuit of sustainable development. 
  Assessing the climate challenge from a sustainable development perspective immediately 
  reveals that countries differ in ways that have dramatic implications for scenario 
  baselines and the range of mitigation options that can be considered. The climate 
  policies that are feasible, and or desirable, in a particular country depend 
  importantly on its available resources and institutions, and on its overall 
  objectives including climate change as but one component. Moreover, although 
  OECD centered models may give helpful first order insights into the efficacy 
  of global scale policy interventions, their underlying assumptions may make 
  them less useful when the heterogeneity of nations is fully incorporated. Recognizing 
  this heterogeneity may lead to a different range of policy options than has 
  been considered likely thus far and may ultimately feed back into policy design 
  for Annex I. Recognizing heterogeneity among countries reveals, in short, differences 
  in the capacities of different sectors that may also enhance appreciation of 
  what can be done by non-state actors as well as governments to build their ability 
  to mitigate. </p>
<p>While sustainability has been incorporated in the analyses in a number of ways, 
  a class of studies takes the issue of Global Sustainability as the point of 
  departure. One popular method for identifying constraints and opportunities 
  within this perspective is to identify future sustainable states and then examine 
  possible transition paths to those states for feasibility and desirability. 
  In the case of developing countries this leads to a number of possible strategies 
  that can depart significantly from what the developed countries pursued in the 
  past.</p>
<p>The chapter closes with a discussion of preliminary attempts to integrate the 
  information and insights that result from studies done from the three perspectives. 
  Within this report the concept of &#147;co-benefits&#148; is used to capture 
  dimensions of the response to mitigation policies from the equity and sustainability 
  perspectives in a way that could be used to modify the cost projections produced 
  by those working form the cost-effectiveness perspective although ancillary 
  benefit has been more widely used in the literature. The concept of &#147;mitigative 
  capacity&#148; is also introduced as a possible way to integrate results derived 
  from the application of the three perspectives in the future.</p>
