<h3>6.2.3 Mixes of National Policy Instruments </h3>
<p><a href="234.htm">Section 6.2.2</a> discusses various policy instruments to 
  manage GHG emissions in isolation. Various authors (e.g., Bernstein, 1993; Richards, 
  1998; Stavins, 1998b) argue that to select the best approach to attain the environmental 
  goal, various cost and other aspects must be taken into account. These include 
  production costs, cost differences across sources, transaction costs, monitoring 
  and enforcement costs, implementation, administrative costs, and other socio-economic 
  conditions idiosyncratic to each country. For these reasons, it can be anticipated 
  that in most countries GHG emissions will be managed using a portfolio of policy 
  instruments, rather than a single policy instrument. Furthermore, the portfolio 
  of instruments is likely to differ from country to country. Using a portfolio 
  of policy instruments enables a government to combine the strengths, while compensating 
  for the weaknesses, of individual policy instruments, thus improving overall 
  effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
<p>Under some conditions a combination of market-based and information policies 
  and regulations can improve economic efficiency. Well-designed policies aimed 
  at energy prices are economically most efficient when transaction costs are 
  low and/or cannot be substantially reduced through market transformation policies. 
  They also work best when the potential for technological learning by doing is 
  small or known with reasonable certainty. Well-designed regulatory and incentives-based 
  policies aimed at factors other than energy prices are economically most efficient 
  when the transaction costs are large and can be substantially reduced at low 
  administrative cost. They also work best when the potential for technological 
  learning by doing is large. Virtually all end-use markets for energy efficiency 
  suffer from high transaction costs and related market problems. Also, many energy 
  efficiency and renewables technologies exhibit large potentials for learning 
  by doing. The most effective and economically efficient approach to achieve 
  lower energy sector emissions is to apply market-based instruments, standards, 
  and information policies in combination. Policies to administer energy price 
  changes provide a uniform signal to all economic actors and overcome fragmentation. 
  Standards and information policies can move the economy closer to the frontier 
  of production possibilities, which raises total factor productivity.</p>
<p>Overriding non-economic reasons may also exist for combining different types 
  of policy instruments to manage GHG mitigation. First, the number and diversity 
  of sources is large and even the most comprehensive instruments (an emissions 
  tax or a tradable permit system) is not suitable for all of these sources. Second, 
  the conditions needed to administer efficiently these comprehensive instruments 
  (e.g., a manageable number of participants, but enough to create a competitive 
  market for a tradable permit system) may reduce the scope of their application. 
  Third, different policy instruments can be used to distribute the mitigation-cost 
  burden across sources in ways that lessen opposition to the policy goal. Fourth, 
  policy instruments have multiple impacts, so different instruments and sets 
  of impacts are preferred for different sources. Finally, governments have frequently 
  adopted a portfolio of policies, rather than a single policy instrument, to 
  deal with complex environmental issues.</p>
<p>One important aspect in the policy analysis has been a shift of attention from 
  the assessment of single policy instruments to questions of the optimal policy 
  mix (OECD, 1996b). Assessing the performance of particular environmental policy 
  instruments from historical evidence is difficult because these were often combined 
  in policy packages, as was the case with the phase-down of leaded petrol in 
  a number of European countries. Econometric analysis has been employed to separate 
  out the effects of individual policy instruments under such conditions, but 
  this is not always possible (Katsoulacos and Xepapadeas, 1996; Boom, 1998).</p>
