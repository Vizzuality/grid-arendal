<h4>10.3.3.3 Technology Transfer: National Aspects </h4>
<h4><a name="103331"></a>10.3.3.3.1 Research and Development: Supply Side</h4>
<p>Research and development (R&amp;D) is a process of forming new ideas and transforming 
  them into products and services. Technology capacity at both the assessment 
  and replication stages of the technology transfer process have to be underpinned 
  by R&amp;D. Central to this process are national systems of innovation and international 
  co-operation between public research institutions and private-sector entities 
  in R&amp;D. Governments have been investing for three decades in R&amp;D for 
  ESTs in the energy sector. There may be a case for seeing whether results from 
  this process have been used and disseminated sufficiently. Developing countries&#146; 
  R&amp;D efforts are often adaptive, following externally developed technology, 
  which suggests the need for additional resources to develop indigenous innovative 
  capacity. The activities at all stages of technological development and implementation 
  are necessary to attain short-term and long-term technical results (Elliot and 
  Pye, 1998). In the field of climate change, R&amp;D of mitigation and adaptation 
  technologies can reduce the costs of implementation of mitigation and adaptation 
  measures, and provides decision makers with viable alternatives in the formulation 
  of response strategies to climate change.</p>
<p>The process of technological innovation includes not only research and development, 
  but also innovation in the design of products, technological processes, and 
  manufacturing, and innovation in management and market exploration. The private 
  sector has played an important role in the development of energy-efficiency 
  technologies, and is becoming increasingly active in developing renewable-energy 
  technologies (Forsyth, 1999). The bulk of R&amp;D and technology transfer in 
  the energy sector is mainly driven by oil, natural gas, and power supply companies. 
  Other energy supply technologies, such as coal, nuclear, and renewable sources, 
  are often dependent on governments to preserve or increase their presence in 
  the market. Governments can play an important role in R&amp;D as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>establish a National System of Innovation&#151;institutional and organizational 
    structures to support technological development and innovation<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#21","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>21</sup></small></a>;<br>
  </li>
  <li>build and strengthen scientific and technical educational institutions and 
    modify the form or operation of technology networks;<br>
  </li>
  <li>guide the advancement in science and technology and the direction of investment 
    through industrial and technological policies, and provide suggestions and 
    consultation to enterprises;<br>
  </li>
  <li>encourage enterprises to increase investment in R&amp;D of ESTs through 
    effective policies and create a favourable environment for the innovative 
    activities of enterprises;<br>
  </li>
  <li>make efforts to increase R&amp;D investments through the governmental budget 
    to accelerate the formation of diversified investment and financing systems, 
    including different kinds of loans;<br>
  </li>
  <li>give policy support to R&amp;D to encourage the development of innovative 
    technologies and products in the field of climate change, including preferential 
    tax policies, import and export tax policies, and government procurement policies;<br>
  </li>
  <li>develop modalities for the transfer of public owned or supported ESTs;<br>
  </li>
  <li>provide funds for licensing of patented ESTs entities to encourage the private-sector 
    to transfer ESTs they own to developing countries.</li>
</ul>
