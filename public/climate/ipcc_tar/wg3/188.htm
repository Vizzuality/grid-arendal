<h4>5.3.1.3 The Context for Technological Change </h4>
<p>The wider context plays an important role in shaping technological change and 
  hence in determining the feasibility of GHG mitigation. There are several important 
  elements or dimensions of the context for technological change:</p>
<ul>
  <li>market conditions, including ease of entry for new firms and technologies; 
    availability of capital; the degree of internalization of social and environmental 
    concerns through taxes, subsidies, insurance, and other mechanisms; and the 
    degree of competitiveness, including any oligopolistic practices or informal 
    arrangements between government and the private sector;</li>
  <li>the legal system, including the system of intellectual property rights; 
    the allocation (e.g., among firms or between the public and private sector) 
    of liability for past and future environmental damage; freedom of speech and 
    information; and ease of litigation;</li>
  <li>the physical infrastructure, including the design of cities and other settlements, 
    transport systems, and utilities; and their flexibility in permitting the 
    adoption of alternative technologies, lifestyles, and production systems;</li>
  <li>social and political structures, including the role of the public in decision-making; 
    the location of power in institutional and social relationships; the presence 
    of formal or informal alliances, for example involving government, industry, 
    and the media; and the allocations of roles within households and communities;</li>
  <li>culture, including cultural diversity; the role of technology and material 
    consumption in establishing individual identity, status, and social bonds; 
    tendencies towards competition and co-operation, conformity, and distinction; 
    and</li>
  <li>psychology, including awareness, understanding, and attitudes relating to 
    climate change, its causes and potential impacts, and to changes in technology 
    and lifestyles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these dimensions, most attention has been paid in the literature, including 
  the SAR, to the role of markets and legal systems. Existing market and legal 
  incentives can pose barriers to some kinds of technological change, as discussed 
  in later sections of this chapter. Changes in the market and legislative context 
  can also provide opportunities for innovation. For example, the need to address 
  local pollution through government regulations may stimulate innovation that 
  can contribute to GHG mitigation. Porter and Van der Linde (1995a) argued that 
  environmental regulation of industries could also promote their competitiveness 
  through accelerated innovation, although this has been disputed by Palmer <i>et al</i>. (1995), who argues that most evidence is that regulation, as historically 
  practised, has not fostered competitiveness, and has encouraged innovation only 
  narrowly aimed at regulatory compliance (Berman and Bui, 1998; Xepapadeas and 
  de Zeeuw, 1999).</p>
<p>The effects of physical infrastructure have been less studied, being harder 
  to measure than those of prices and regulations. Infrastructure often acts as 
  a constraint on changes in technology and behaviour: existing road systems and 
  settlement patterns in many countries tend to encourage car dependency; the 
  existing supply networks for domestic and transport fuels make it difficult 
  for individual households or firms to adopt alternatives. In this chapter, the 
  role of infrastructure is considered in relation to buildings, transport, and 
  energy supply (see <a href="206.htm">Sections 5.4.1</a> to <a href="211.htm">5.4.3</a>).</p>
<p>The social capital passed on from generation to generation offers an opportunity 
  for diffusion of GHG mitigation technologies in traditional and modern societies 
  alike. Societies in which trust and civic co-operation are strong have significant 
  positive impact on productivity, especially human capital productivity, and 
  provide stronger incentives to innovate and to accumulate physical capital. 
  More investment in consultation and participation of the local population in 
  decision making about GHG mitigation technologies contribute both to information 
  sharing, to building trust, and civic co-operation. The former may contribute 
  to changes in beliefs, norms, and values if participants are convinced that 
  they are better off after effecting the change (Gibson <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>Reliance on market mechanisms alone, without an appropriate institutional framework 
  that performs a co-ordinating function among sectors, is inadequate and may 
  be destructive of social capital. Policy attention to learning by doing, and 
  network externalities, together with policy stability and enforcement favour 
  the diffusion of GHG mitigation technologies.</p>
<p>Addressing the last three dimensions listed above thus involves understanding 
  human psychology, relationships, communities, institutions, and the process 
  through which social norms and decisions are established. These aspects of climate 
  mitigation are addressed in <a href="194.htm">Sections 5.3.6</a> and <a href="198.htm">5.3.8</a> 
  of this Chapter.</p>
