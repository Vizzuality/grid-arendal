<h4>8.2.2.3 The Distributional Effects of Mitigation </h4>
<p>A policy that leads to an efficiency gain may not improve overall welfare if 
  some people are in a worse position than before, and vice versa. Notably, if 
  there is a wish to reduce the income differences in a society, the effect on 
  the income distribution should be taken into account in the assessment.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the distributional incidence of higher energy prices is significantly 
  conditional upon the indicator used. Distributional impacts appear to be higher 
  when additional costs are measured in terms of percentage of total household 
  expenditures rather than income, and higher if current income is considered 
  instead of lifetime income. Lifetime income is relevant in the sense that households 
  can borrow or save, and also move between different income classes. According 
  to Poterba (1991), a person had only a 41% chance of being in the same quintile 
  of income distribution in 1971 and in 1978. This percentage rises to 54% if 
  the person initially belongs to the poorest quintile. However, current income 
  is relevant to studies on the short-term intergeneration impact of a new tax. 
  For example, an elderly person is more adversely affected by new taxes on expenditures 
  than are those on an income, even if subsequent generations pay the same lifetime 
  tax bill under each factor influencing the macroeconomy. </p>
<p>International competition limits the ability of firms to pass the tax onto 
  prices, thus reducing the size of the indirect distributional effect. In the 
  same way, the degree of production factor substitution determines the extent 
  to which the tax changes prices. Moreover, as the substitution is generally 
  supposed to be limited in the short term, but increasing as existing plants 
  are replaced, the distributional effect of an environmental tax changes over 
  time. Last, but not least, the distributional effect depends basically on the 
  utilization of the tax revenue.</p>
<p>Two British studies looked at distributional effects of climate policies. Barker 
  and Johnstone (1993) investigated the distributional effects of a carbon&#150;energy 
  tax. Revenues are recycled through an energy efficiency programme and compared 
  to lump-sum transfers. The results show that the burden of a carbon&#150;energy 
  tax falls most heavily on low-income groups. At the same time, for these low-income 
  groups the potential gains to be realized by increasing energy efficiency are 
  higher to offset this regressive outcome. Symons<i> et al.</i> (1994) investigated 
  other various assumptions of revenue recycling for the UK, and found that to 
  introduce a carbon tax without recycling or with recycling through VAT or petrol 
  excise-duty reductions is significantly regressive. Conversely, recycling the 
  carbon tax by a combination of VAT rate reductions and benefits reforms directed 
  towards poorer households results in favourable distributive effects.</p>
<p>The conclusion is similar for other countries. For Ireland, O&#146;Donoghue 
  (1997) found that carbon taxation is generally regressive, but that recycling 
  the carbon tax through a fixed basic income for all individuals allows the distributional 
  effects to become almost neutral. For Norway, Brendemoen and Vennemo (1994) 
  concluded that a global carbon tax of US$325/tC in 2000 and US$700/tC in 2025 
  (1987 prices) has no significant impact on the regional distribution of welfare. 
  For Australia, Cornwell and Creedy (1996) found that a carbon tax only affecting 
  households (the input&#150;output matrix is constant in their model) is clearly 
  regressive, but can become neutral if adequate recycling is implemented. In 
  addition, the distributional differences across income are not affected much. 
  On the other hand, Aasness<i> et al.</i> (1996) conclude for the same country 
  that poor households are less favourably affected than rich households, because 
  of smaller budget shares on consumer goods (which imply relatively more CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions) in the rich households. Harrison and Kristr&ouml;m (1999) studied 
  the general equilibrium effects of a scenario in Sweden in which the existing 
  carbon taxes increase by 100% and labour taxes are reduced to maintain constant 
  governmental revenue, but without removing the existing exemptions from carbon 
  taxes. All households lose from this carbon tax (with tax exemptions) increase. 
  They point out that the distributional effects are very dependent on the size 
  of the household (the more affected being those with children). In a study for 
  11 EU member states, Barker and Kohler (1998) examined emission reductions of 
  10% below baseline by 2010. They concluded that the changes would be weakly 
  regressive for nearly all the member states if revenues are used to reduce employers&#146; 
  taxes, and strongly progressive if they are returned lump-sum to households.</p>
<p>In summary, most studies show that the distributional effects of a carbon tax 
  are regressive unless the tax revenues are used either directly or indirectly 
  in favour of the low-income groups (see also Poterba, 1991; Barker, 1993; Hamilton 
  and Cameron, 1994; OECD, 1995; Cornwell and Creedy, 1996; Oliveira Martins and 
  Sturn, 1998; Smith, 1998; Fortin, 1999). This undesirable effect can be totally 
  or partially compensated by a revenue-recycling policy if the climate policy 
  is implemented through carbon taxes or auctioned permits. </p>
<p>Three other issues of distributional effects, not dealt with here, are industry 
  sector impacts, regional effects, and how people are affected by environmental 
  damage. For instance, a tax on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions obviously leads to very 
  different effects in energy-intensive industries than in sectors producing labour-intensive 
  services (see <a href="353.htm">Chapter 9</a>). In addition, the poor household 
  generally lives in the most polluted area and then benefits first from the amelioration 
  of air quality induced by GHG reduction policy (see <a href="334.htm">Section 
  8.2.4</a>).<br>
