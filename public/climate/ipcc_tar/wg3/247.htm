<h3>6.3.2 Project-based Mechanisms (Joint Implementation and the Clean Development 
  Mechanism)</h3>
<p>Project-based mechanisms allow actions that reduce GHG emissions from, or enhance 
  sinks beyond, what would otherwise occur to receive &#147;credits&#148; for 
  the emissions mitigated; these credits can be used by Annex I Parties to help 
  meet their emissions limitation commitments. These mechanisms include technology 
  transfer and provide opportunities for mutual co-operation. JI involves emissions 
  reduction or sink enhancement projects in Annex I countries. CDM involves emissions 
  mitigation projects in non-Annex I countries.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#64","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>64</sup></small></a> 
  Central to these mechanisms is the operational definition of what emissions 
  would have been in the absence of the project; the baseline from which emission 
  reductions (or sink enhancements) are measured. This section focuses on setting 
  the baselines for crediting.</p>
<h4><a name="6321"></a>6.3.2.1 Joint Implementation (Article 6)</h4>
<p>Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol allows an Annex I country to contribute to 
  the implementation of a project to reduce emissions (or enhance a sink) in another 
  Annex I country and to receive emission reduction units (ERUs) equal to part 
  or all of the emission reduction (sink enhancement) achieved. The ERUs received 
  by the investor country can be used to help meet its national emissions limitation 
  commitment.</p>
<p>In the case of JI, some analysts have suggested that an independent authority 
  responsible for approving the project baseline is needed in addition to the 
  Parties&#146; approval of the project. Others argue that the host government 
  has an incentive to ensure that ERUs are issued for real emission reductions 
  only if the government is bound to strong and credible penalties for non-compliance 
  (see also <a href="253.htm">Section 6.3.5</a>).</p>
<p>Numerous issues related to JI remain to be agreed, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>host and project eligibility;<br>
  </li>
  <li>the possibility of awarding ERUs for emission reductions from JI projects 
    prior to the start of the first commitment period (see Parkinson <i>et al</i>., 1999);<br>
  </li>
  <li>monitoring, verification, and reporting requirements;<br>
  </li>
  <li>baseline updating frequency;<br>
  </li>
  <li>ERU approval, registry, and trading conditions;<br>
  </li>
  <li>supplementarity provisions; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>incentives for compliance.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="6322"></a>6.3.2.2 The Clean Development Mechanism (Article 12)</h4>
<p>The purposes of the CDM are to assist non-Annex I Parties to achieve sustainable 
  development and to contribute to the ultimate objective of the Convention while 
  assisting compliance by Annex I Parties (UNFCCC, 1997, Article 12.2). The CDM 
  allows a project to reduce emissions, or possibly to enhance sinks, in a country 
  without a national commitment to generate certified emission reductions (CERs) 
  equal to the reduction achieved.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#65","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>65</sup></small></a> 
  Annex I Parties can use CERs to meet national emissions limitation commitments. 
  In contrast to JI, for which there is little peer-reviewed literature, the literature 
  is rapidly growing on the CDM (Goldemberg, 1998; Michaelowa and Dutschke, 1998; 
  TERI, 1998; Hassing and Mendis, 1999; Jepma and van der Gaast, 1999; Haites 
  and Yamin, 2000).</p>
<p>A process for independent review of the certification of the emission reductions 
  achieved is necessary for the credibility of the CDM. Article 12.4 establishes 
  an executive board for the CDM and Article 12.5 specifies that emission reductions 
  must represent real, measurable, and long-term benefits related to the mitigation 
  of climate change and be certified by designated operational entities. The certification 
  process and the respective roles of the operational entities and the executive 
  board remain to be defined, but they will be critical.</p>
<p>The host government must approve proposed CDM projects. As part of its approval 
  process it will need to assess whether the proposed project contributes to sustainable 
  development (Matsuo, 1998; Begg, <i>et al</i>., 2000). Some Parties have proposed criteria 
  or procedures that the host government be required to follow when determining 
  whether a project contributes to sustainable development of the country (see 
  also Thorne and La Rovere, 1999; Chadwick, <i>et al</i>., 2000; Begg, <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Investments in CDM projects by Annex I governments could lead to a reduction 
  in their official development assistance (ODA).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#66","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>66</sup></small></a> 
  The effect of government investment in CDM projects on the level of ODA will 
  be difficult to determine since the level of ODA in the absence of CDM projects 
  is unobservable. However, historical figures compiled by the OECD Development 
  Assistance Committee could be used to try to deal with this.</p>
<p>Article 12.8 specifies that a share of the proceeds from CDM projects will 
  be used to cover administrative expenses and to assist developing country Parties 
  that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change to 
  meet the costs of adaptation. Articles 6 and 17 do not impose a comparable levy 
  on JI projects or international transfers of AAUs, although a number of developing 
  countries have proposed that the levy be applied to all three mechanisms.</p>
<p>CDM projects can begin to create CERs upon ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. 
  The advantage is that it supports developing countries obtaining access to cleaner 
  technologies earlier. It means that a supply of CERs should be available prior 
  to the start of the 2008 to 2012 commitment period when they can be used by 
  Annex I Parties.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#67","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>67</sup></small></a> 
  Parkinson <i>et al</i>. (1999) argue that creation of CERs during 2000 to 2007, which 
  are credited towards 2008 to 2012 compliance, increases the emissions trajectories 
  of Annex I countries for 2000 to 2012. They estimate that increased Annex I 
  emissions offset 30&#150;60% of the CERs created during 2000 to 2012.</p>
<p>Some analysts argue that the CDM facilitates the transfer of CERs from low-cost 
  emission reduction actions to Annex I investors when they might subsequently 
  be needed by the host government to meet a future emissions limitation commitment. 
  However, this assumes a fixed stock of emission reduction actions. In practice, 
  the stock of possible emission reduction (or possibly sink enhancement) actions 
  changes over time in response to turnover of the capital stock, technological 
  change, and other developments. Rose <i>et al</i>. (1999) analyzes the optimal strategy 
  for a host government given a dynamic stock of potential projects.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#68","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>68</sup></small></a> 
</p>
<p>Numerous issues related to implementation of the CDM remain to be negotiated, 
  including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>host and project eligibility;<br>
  </li>
  <li>eligibility of sequestration actions;<br>
  </li>
  <li>demonstrating contribution to sustainable development;<br>
  </li>
  <li>project financing arrangements;<br>
  </li>
  <li>monitoring, verification, and reporting requirements;<br>
  </li>
  <li>baseline establishment;<br>
  </li>
  <li>CER certification, registry, and trading conditions;<br>
  </li>
  <li>the share of proceeds for administrative expenses and adaptation assistance;<br>
  </li>
  <li>adaptation assistance fund administration;<br>
  </li>
  <li>supplementarity provisions;<br>
  </li>
  <li>executive board composition and responsibilities;<br>
  </li>
  <li>process for designation of operational entities; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>penalties for non-compliance.</li>
