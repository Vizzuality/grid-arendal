<h4>7.3.2.4 Specific Baseline Issues Related to International Co-operative Mechanisms 
  for Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions </h4>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
  (UNFCCC) includes a number of mechanisms for international co-operation about 
  GHG emission reductions. The Protocol includes two project-based mechanisms, 
  namely the clean development mechanism (CDM) and joint implementation (JI). 
  The operational details of these two mechanisms are discussed in a number of 
  studies which include a number of different arguments for baseline case approaches. 
  A number of these arguments are subsequently referred and discussed. </p>
<p>A number of studies suggest the use of a so-called standard methodology for 
  setting the baseline case for CDM and JI projects. Here, the baseline case serves 
  as a metric for calculating GHG emission reductions that originate from the 
  approved projects and the main issue is therefore to specify GHG emissions in 
  the absence of the project. A number of specific complexities arise in relation 
  to the definition of baseline cases for projects that do not include major new 
  capital equipment, such as projects that include changes in operational practice, 
  land use, land-use changes, and forestry projects. </p>
<p>Papers that evaluate alternative options for the baseline determination of 
  CDM projects include Michaelowa and Dutschke (1998), Chomnitz (1999), Jepma 
  (1999), Matsuo (1999), Parson and Fisher-Vanden (1999), and Harrison <i>et al</i>. 
  (2000). These papers deal with various baseline issues including technology 
  benchmarks, normative benchmarks that are politically chosen, and historical 
  benchmarks based on GHG emission trends. Other important aspects considered 
  include assumptions about baseline development over the timeframe of the CDM 
  project. </p>
<p>He and Chen (1999) have suggested a set of criteria to establish baseline cases 
  from a micro level perspective. In this approach, GHG emissions reduction projects 
  are divided into three project categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>technology innovation, in which the GHG emission reduction project should 
    be compared with existing technologies;<br>
  </li>
  <li>new constructed plants, in which the GHG emission reduction project should 
    be compared with alternative new advanced technologies; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>technology substitution, in which the GHG emissions reduction project should 
    be compared with a newly constructed existing plant. </li>
</ul>
<p>A benchmark technology baseline to assess power-sector CDM projects could include 
  assumptions about the efficiency and costs of power production technologies 
  in a specific national or regional area, or could be based on international 
  standards. The actual definition of baseline technologies will has major implications 
  on the GHG emission reduction &#147;performance&#148; of the CDM project. </p>
<p>The choice of baseline case approach for CDM projects or JI projects might 
  have major implications on the global cost effectiveness of climate change mitigation 
  projects. A baseline scenario approach that uses internationally standardized 
  technology data implies that the GHG emission reduction potential and related 
  costs are estimated to be similar for projects implemented at quite different 
  sites. Project host countries that have a relatively low GHG emission intensity 
  from their power system compared with the international baseline standard have 
  a relatively strong &#147;market position&#148; in this case, because the GHG 
  emission reductions achieved with the particular CDM or JI project will be assessed 
  to be relatively high. Project host countries with a relatively high GHG emission 
  intensity compared with the international standard will tend to have a weaker 
  market position than in the alternative approach, in which the baseline case 
  reflects specific national GHG emissions. Baseline cases that underestimate 
  the reductions from a particular project in this way result in fewer projects 
  than is justified. This use of international benchmark technology standards 
  can tend to imply a loss in the global cost-effectiveness of CDM or JI projects.</p>
<p>Another drawback to using a baseline case not related to the specific development 
  context of the project host country is that it can be difficult to design the 
  project such that it creates both global (GHG emission reduction) and local 
  benefits (improvements in the local environment, employment, and income generation, 
  and institutional strengthening). Such drawbacks, however, should be balanced 
  against the expected decrease in transaction costs from using an international 
  benchmark baseline case approach.</p>
