<h2><a name="12"></a>1.2 Cost-effective Mitigation</h2>
<h3><a name="121"></a>1.2.1 Introduction </h3>
<p>This section describes the key themes that have been pursued by the research 
  community working from the &#147;cost-effective mitigation&#148; perspective 
  (as conceptualized in <a href="051.htm#fig12">Figure 1.2</a>). The focus here 
  is on the kinds of issues that the research community working from this perspective 
  address and not on specific results. </p>

<p>Researchers working from a cost-effective perspective generally focus on achieving 
  some policy objective at minimum cost. Cost minimization, in some cases, is 
  used to compare alternative ways to meet some climate policy objective (like 
  a specific GHG emissions or concentration target); in other cases, alternative 
  ways to minimize the total cost of climate change and policies designed to ameliorate 
  its impacts are considered. In the former, the policy objective is included 
  as a constraint; but in the latter, the objective is to minimize the cost of 
  the climate change. In either case, the policies considered are generally restricted 
  to those that directly affect energy use or other activities with a direct impact 
  on GHG emissions. Although equity and sustainability metrics are frequently 
  examined in these analyses, their inclusion usually occurs after the cost-effectiveness 
  calculations have been completed. Exceptions to this general observation include 
  input assumptions related to discounting and utility function parameters that 
  do represent trade-offs between the utilities of various groups and generations. 
  Judicious use of sensitivity analysis can, however, illuminate the trade-offs 
  implied along these dimensions, but these trade-offs are not usually the main 
  focus of such studies. It is therefore difficult, ex post, to graft other policy 
  objectives related to development or sustainability (e.g., poverty reduction, 
  human capital development) onto a cost-effectiveness style of assessment. </p>
<h3><a name="122"></a>1.2.2 The Costs of Climate Change Mitigation</h3>
<p>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change makes clear that 
  cost-effectiveness is an important criterion to be used (among others) in formulating 
  and implementing climate policies. As stated in Article 
  3.3 of the convention &#147;&#133;taking into account that policies and 
  measures to deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure 
  that global benefits at the lowest possible cost (UNFCC, 1992)&#148;. The impacts 
  of climate policy can be defined as the changes that policies cause relative 
  to some &#147;business-as-usual&#148; or &#147;baseline&#148; situation. As 
  discussed in <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a>, a baseline is a scenario of 
  how the global or regional environments, depending on the study, will evolve 
  over time (often over 100 years or more for baselines used in climate policy 
  studies) in the absence of climate policy intervention. Thus, a baseline is 
  typically built upon assumptions about future population growth, economic output, 
  and resource and technology availability, as well as upon assumptions about 
  future non-climate environmental policies, like controls on sulphur dioxide 
  emissions. Changes from these baselines are frequently put into categories of 
  &#147;benefits&#148; and &#147;costs&#148;. The benefits included in the calculus 
  are estimated from avoided climate damages and other ancillary benefits that 
  would have otherwise occurred if mitigation policies had not been introduced. 
  The costs for mitigation and other side effects that result are estimated from 
  economic sacrifices that might be required to mitigate climate change.</p>
<p>Climate change would be a relatively simple problem to overcome if it could 
  be avoided without sacrifice and if the means to effect this avoidance were 
  recognized widely. At present, however, there are concerns about the sacrifices 
  that avoiding climate change might involve. A fundamental challenge in mitigation 
  policy analysis is thus to discern how climate change can be avoided at a minimal 
  cost or sacrifice. <a href="089.htm">Chapters 3</a>-<a href="353.htm">9</a> describe a number 
  of advances since WGIII SAR that identify methods to 
  reduce the costs of climate change mitigation. Indeed, these chapters report 
  that some degree of mitigation might be achieved at zero cost.</p>
<p><a href="266.htm">Chapter 7</a> distinguishes several cost concepts. Opportunity 
  cost (the value of a sacrificed opportunity) constitutes a basis upon which 
  estimates of economic cost are constructed. The extent of the costs of mitigating 
  climate change is, from an economic perspective, measured in terms of the value 
  of other opportunities that must be forgone (for example, the opportunity to 
  enjoy low prices for domestic heating or other energy services). It follows 
  that economic costs can be different when they are viewed from different perspectives. 
  Costs of mitigation incurred by a regulated sector are, for example, generally 
  different from economy-wide costs. Costs are sometimes measured in currency 
  units, but they are sometimes also measured against other metrics. In all cases, 
  though, the underlying element of cost is the sacrifice of opportunities, goods, 
  or services; and this element is often quite different from the overt financial 
  outlay involved.</p>
<p><a href="266.htm">Chapter 7</a> also indicates that some notions of cost 
  incorporate behavioural, institutional, or cultural responses that can be missed 
  by economic analyses. In measuring opportunity costs, more specifically, economic 
  analyses generally take personal preferences, social and legal institutions, 
  and cultural values as given. Yet climate policies can affect (positively or 
  negatively) the functioning of institutions. They can alter the ways in which 
  people relate to each other; and they can influence individuals&#146; attitudes, 
  values, or preferences. Taking these impacts into account can alter the cost 
  assessment. Moreover, while economic analyses (including standard benefit&#150;cost 
  analyses) tend to measure costs by adding up individuals&#146; valuations of 
  their forgone opportunities, other approaches to cost can be defined in terms 
  that are not simple aggregations of individual measures. </p>
<p>As discussed below, equitable policy making brings attention to the distribution 
  of costs as well as to their aggregate levels. There has been considerable progress 
  since SAR in identifying ways that climate change can be avoided at lower costs. 
  Both theoretical and modelling studies have helped to reveal the types of policies 
  that might achieve given targets at the lowest cost. Moreover, as indicated 
  below, models have identified certain circumstances in which at least some reductions 
  in GHGs might be achieved at no cost. </p>
<p><a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> reports that the cost of mitigation can 
  depend significantly on the selection of a designated concentration target that, 
  typically, is assumed to be achievable within 100 or 200 years. Most model-based 
  studies indicate that the first units of abatement are fairly inexpensive; &#147;low-hanging 
  fruit&#148; is easily picked. However, most studies show that additional units 
  of abatement require more extensive changes and involve significantly higher 
  costs.<a href="fn1.htm#3" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>3</sup></small></a> 
  Thus, to lower the original concentration target is projected to result in a 
  more than proportional increase in costs. Rising marginal abatement costs provide 
  a rationale to employ broad-based, economically efficient mechanisms for GHG 
  abatement.</p>
<p>The cost of mitigation depends not only upon the cumulative emissions reductions 
  required over the next century, but on the timing of these emissions reductions 
  as well. <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> reviews some studies that argue 
  the most cost-effective approach to achieving a given long-term concentration 
  target involves gradually rising abatement through time. The attraction of this 
  approach is that it helps avoid the premature turnover of stocks of capital. 
  In addition, deferring the bulk of abatement effort to the future allows more 
  discounting of abatement costs. However, other studies show potential cost advantages 
  in concentrating more abatement towards the near term. These studies argue, 
  in particular, that near-term abatement helps generate cost-effective &#147;learning-by-doing&#148;, 
  by accelerating the development of new technologies that can reduce future abatement 
  costs. These findings are not necessarily contradictory. By introducing mitigation 
  efforts in the near term, the process of learning-by-doing is initiated. At 
  the same time, by increasing over time the stringency of policies (that is, 
  the extent of abatement), nations can avoid premature capital-stock turnover 
  and exploit the cost savings from future technological advances. <a href="379.htm">Chapter 
  10</a> elaborates on these issues.</p>
<p>It is worth emphasizing that abatement policies (such as the introduction of 
  national targets on carbon emissions or policies to stimulate the development 
  of energy technologies not based on carbon, as discussed in <a href="089.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>) can proceed in the near term even when abatement efforts are significantly 
  deferred to the future. The near-term introduction of policies helps to stimulate 
  efforts to bring about new technologies, which is crucial to enable future abatement 
  to be achieved at lower cost. <br>
  <br>
  As <a href="224.htm">Chapter 6</a> discusses, individual countries can choose 
  from a large set of possible policy instruments to limit domestic GHG emissions. 
  These include traditional regulatory mechanisms such as technology mandates 
  and performance standards. They also include &#147;market-based&#148; instruments 
  such as carbon taxes, energy taxes, tradable emissions permits, and subsidies 
  to clean technologies. They also include various voluntary agreements between 
  industries and regulators. A group of countries that wishes to limit its collective 
  GHG emissions can agree to implement some of these policies in a co-ordinated 
  fashion.</p>
<p><a href="224.htm">Chapters 6</a>-<a href="353.htm">9</a> reveal that the costs 
  of achieving specified mitigation targets depend critically upon the policy 
  instrument employed. Any given target is achieved at the lowest cost when the 
  incremental cost of emissions reduction (abatement) is the same across all emitters. 
  If this condition is not met, then the overall costs of emissions reduction 
  could be reduced if firms with lower incremental costs reduced emissions a bit 
  more, and firms with higher incremental costs pursued a bit less abatement. 
  It follows that cost-effective emissions reductions hold the promise of allowing 
  larger emissions reductions from any allocation of resources<br>
  <br>
  While market-based instruments such as carbon taxes and tradable carbon permits 
  have potential cost advantages, the extent to which these potential advantages 
  are actually realized depends on whether the policy generates revenues and whether 
  these revenues are &#147;recycled&#148; in the form of cuts in existing taxes. 
  Revenue recycling is important to the costs of a carbon tax, for example. When 
  the revenues from the carbon tax finance reductions in the rates of pre-existing 
  taxes, some of the distortionary cost of these prior taxes can be avoided; and 
  so the cost of mitigation is reduced. These issues are further elaborated in 
  <a href="224.htm">Chapters 6</a>-<a href="353.htm">9</a>. </p>
<p>The issue of revenue recycling applies also to policies that would reduce CO<sub>2</sub> 
  through carbon permits or &#147;caps&#148;. As discussed in <a href="224.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>, revenues could be recycled through cuts in existing taxes if CO<sub>2</sub> 
  permits are auctioned. In contrast, if the permits are distributed freely, then 
  no revenue is collected and there is no possibility of revenue recycling. Thus, 
  auctioning the permits has a significant potential cost advantage over free 
  allocation. </p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that aggregate costs are not the only 
  useful consideration in evaluating alternative policy instruments from the cost-effectiveness 
  perspective. The distribution of these costs across businesses, regions, and 
  individuals is important as well. Moreover, other important evaluation criteria, 
  including administrative and political feasibility, can play a role in determining 
  exactly how and why mitigation initiatives might emerge. </p>
<p>The theoretical and modelling literature also reveals that international policy 
  co-ordination through &#147;flexibility mechanisms&#148; offers enormous opportunities 
  to achieve given reductions in GHG emissions at relatively lower cost. In principle, 
  co-ordinated policies can be designed so that cost-effectiveness is improved 
  on a global scale. The Kyoto Protocol defines several flexibility mechanisms, 
  including international emissions trading (IET), joint implementation (JI), 
  and the clean development mechanism (CDM). Each of these international policy 
  instruments provides opportunities, in theory, for Annex I Parties to fulfil 
  their commitments cost-effectively. IET allows Annex I parties to exchange parts 
  of their assigned amount. Similarly, JI allows Annex I parties to exchange &#147;emission 
  reduction units&#148; among themselves on a project-by-project basis. Under 
  the CDM, Annex I parties receive credit, on a project-by-project basis, for 
  reductions accomplished in non-Annex I countries. Participation in these programmes 
  can also increase the level of investment in clean energy technologies. International 
  policy co-ordination in implementing climate policy also requires accounting 
  for the &#147; spillover&#148; effects of mitigation in one country that can 
  effect economic activity in other countries through international trade linkages. 
  In general, countries that mitigate less may gain an advantage in their share 
  of international trade over their trading partners, but can also lose market 
  share if those trading partners control more and thus reduce their overall level 
  of economic activity. See <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> for more on these 
  issues.</p>
<p>Most studies of national or global mitigation costs focus on CO<sub>2</sub> 
  from fossil energy alone (e.g., see <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a>), but some 
  recent studies consider other GHGs as well. For example, <a href="089.htm">Chapters 
  3</a> and <a href="155.htm">4</a> discuss options to reduce emissions of non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  gases and CO<sub>2</sub> net emissions from land-use change, respectively. <a href="319.htm">Chapter 
  8</a> indicates that defining national targets in terms of a &#147;basket&#148; 
  of gases (as under the Kyoto Protocol) rather than in terms of individual gases 
  enhances flexibility and can reduce the costs of mitigating climate change. 
  Emissions of several of the GHGs (such as methane and nitrous oxide) from some 
  sources can, in addition, be very difficult to monitor. This practical complication 
  raises the potential cost of mitigation over the short- to medium-term, because 
  it highlights the need to improve the methods used to monitor these emissions.
