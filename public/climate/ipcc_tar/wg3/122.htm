<h3>3.7.4 Regional Differences</h3>
<p>Individual countries have adopted different strategies and innovations in waste 
  management that reduce GHG emissions. It is not possible to provide a comprehensive 
  description in this chapter, but a sampling of different national and regional 
  strategies is summarized below.</p>
<a name="3741"></a> 
<h4>3.7.4.1 Germany</h4>
<p>Germany promotes recycling through the world&#146;s most stringent return requirements 
  for packaging and many other goods, including automobiles; materials management 
  is the responsibility of the manufacturer through the end of product life, including 
  ultimate disposal or reuse of the materials from which it is made. This has 
  led to high recycling rates, but also to high monetary costs, prompting ongoing 
  controversy in Germany and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Every year Germany generates about 30 million tonnes of solid municipal waste. 
  German landfills emit yearly 1.2-1.9Mt of methane, accounting for 25%-35% of 
  Germany&#146;s methane emissions and about 3%-7% of national GWP. To meet the 
  provisions of a 1993 law requiring that by 2005 all wastes disposed in landfills 
  have to have a total organic carbon content of less than 5% will require incineration. 
  Under this law methane emissions are projected to drop by two-thirds by 2005, 
  and by 80% by 2015 (Angerer and Kalb, 1996).</p>
<a name="3742"></a> 
<h4>3.7.4.2 USA</h4>
<p>The USA produces about 200 million tonnes of municipal waste each year. In 
  1997, 55% was landfilled, 28% was recycled or composted, and 17% was incinerated 
  (US EPA, 1999b). The 11.6Mt of methane emitted by landfills accounts for 37% 
  of anthropogenic methane emissions, or about 4% of national GHG emissions. US 
  regulations now require the largest landfills to collect and combust LFG, which 
  is projected to reduce emissions to 9.1Mt in 2010 (US EPA, 1999a). There are 
  more than 150 LFG-to-energy projects in operation, and 200 more in development, 
  promoted by government technical support and tax incentives (Kerr, 1998; Landfill, 
  1998).</p>
<p>If all the material currently recycled in the USA were instead landfilled, 
  national GHG emissions would increase by 2%, even with the new LFG regulations 
  (Ackerman, 2000). More than 9,000 municipal recycling programmes collect household 
  materials, and numerous commercial enterprises also recycle material. Many innovative 
  uses of recycled materials are reducing emissions in manufacturing; for example, 
  remanufacture of commercial carpet from recovered fibres lowers energy inputs 
  by more than 90%, and some products are now said to have zero net GHG impacts 
  (Hawken <i>et al</i>., 1999).</p>
<a name="3743"></a> 
<h4>3.7.4.3 Japan</h4>
<p>With a large waste stream and very limited land area, Japan relies heavily 
  on both recycling and incineration as alternatives to landfilling. Widespread 
  participation in recycling recovers not only easily recycled materials such 
  as metals and glass, but also large quantities of unconventional recycled materials, 
  such as aseptic packaging (juice boxes).</p>
<p>Japan has approximately 1,900 waste incineration facilities of which 171 produce 
  electric power with a capacity of 710MW. A major new commitment to create high 
  efficiency waste to energy facilities has been announced by the Japanese government. 
  In 1998 a corrosion resistant, high temperature, fluidized bed WTE facility 
  achieved 30% conversion efficiency to electricity with low dioxin and stack 
  gas emissions. The facility can accept mixed municipal and industrial waste 
  including plastics and recovers ash for road foundations and recyclable metals 
  (NEDO, 1999).</p>
<a name="3744"></a> 
<h4>3.7.4.4 India</h4>
<p>Recycling is a very prevalent part of Indian society. Unskilled labourers, 
  working in the informal economy, collect newspapers, books, plastic, bottles, 
  and cans and sell them to commercial recyclers. In recent years a shift from 
  collecting for reuse to collecting for recycling has taken place. Because of 
  changing lifestyles and increased consumption of goods, the use of recyclables 
  has increased dramatically over the past few years (from 9.6% in 1971 to 17.2% 
  in 1995). Paper accounts for 6% and ash and fine earth for 40%. Total compostable 
  matter is over 42% of the waste stream.</p>
<p>Plastic in the waste stream increased from 0.7% in 1971 to 4%-9% in 1996, and 
  is expected to grow rapidly. Though current consumption is 1.8 kg/capita/yr 
  compared to a world average of 18 kg and a US average of 80 kg, India recycled 
  between 40-80% of its plastics, compared to 10%-15% in developed nations. There 
  are about 2000 plastic recycling facilities in India, which often cause serious 
  environmental harm as a result of outdated technology. Current per capita paper 
  consumption is 3.6 kg, compared to a world average of 45.6 kg. Paper consumption 
  is projected to increase to 8 kg by 2021. India imports approximately 25% of 
  its paper fibre as waste paper from the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Almost 90% of solid waste is deposited in low-lying dumps and is neither compacted 
  nor covered; 9% is composted. In 1997, landfill emissions were India&#146;s 
  third largest GHG contributors, equivalent to burning 11.6Mt of coal (Gupta 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<a name="3745"></a> 
<h4>3.7.4.5 China</h4>
<p>China generated 108 million tonnes of municipal waste in 1996, an amount that 
  is increasing every year by 8%-10%. In 1995, the GEF approved an action plan 
  and specific projects for methane recovery from municipal waste (Li, 1999).</p>
<p>According to a survey of ten cities, the per capita waste generation averages 
  1.6kg/day, but in some rapidly developing cities in southern China, per capita 
  waste production is almost as high as in developed countries (e.g., Shenzhen, 
  2.62 kg/day). Between 60%-90% of Chinese municipal solid waste is high moisture 
  organic material with a low heat value. The composition of waste is changing, 
  with cinder and soil content decreasing while plastic, metal, glass and organic 
  waste are increasing. Kitchen waste has replaced coal cinder as the largest 
  component, raising the water content. By the end of 1995, incineration treatment 
  capacity was 0.9% of total MSW.</p>
<p>Estimates are that in 2010 China will produce 290 million tonnes of MSW. If 
  70% is disposed of in landfills with methane collection, the landfill gas recovered 
  could be equivalent to 40 to 280 billion m<sup>3</sup> of natural gas (Li, 1999).</p>
<a name="3746"></a> 
<h4>3.7.4.6 Africa</h4>
<p>The average annual solid waste generation in Africa is estimated to be about 
  0.3 to 0.5t/ capita and for a population for Africa of about 740 million in 
  1997, the total continent&#146;s annual generated waste could be as much as 
  200 million tonnes. It is estimated that anything from 30%&#150;50% if the waste 
  is not subjected to proper disposal, presenting severe health and environmental 
  hazards (INFORSE, 1997). With few financial resources, and population increasing 
  at 3% per annum, with the most rapid growth in urban regions from migration, 
  this poses a serious challenge for waste management in the future.</p>
<p>An analysis of energy content of MSW generated in South Africa alone indicates 
  that if one-third were utilized for combustion energy it would be equivalent 
  to 2.6% of the total electricity distributed in 1990 (529Million GJ) by the 
  country&#146;s largest utility, ESKOM. Technologies are not yet available on 
  the continent to make this a reality.</p>
<p>Mitigating CH<sub>4</sub> through extraction of landfill gas for energy use has been estimated 
  to cost below US$10/tC<sub>eq</sub> in Africa (Zhou, 1999). Both incineration of MSW and 
  extraction of landfill gas have significant potential to reduce emissions of 
  methane in Africa, and will provide the co-benefit of addressing the severe 
  waste management problem on the continent.</p>
