<h3>7.1.2 Summary of the Second Assessment Report on Cost Issues </h3>
<p>IPCC&#146;s SAR published a separate volume on the economic and social dimensions 
  of climate change (IPCC, 1996a). This report considered all aspects of climate 
  change, including impacts, adaptation, and mitigation of climate change. The 
  volume on economic and social dimensions was supplemented by a report from another 
  working group of the IPCC that dealt with scientific and technical analyses 
  of the impacts, adaptation, and mitigation of climate change (IPCC, 1996b). 
  The Third Assessment Report (TAR) is structured in a different way. Impacts 
  and adaptation are addressed together by one working group (WGII), and mitigation 
  by another group (WGIII). All the technical areas, including scientific, engineering, 
  economic, and social aspects of climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation, 
  however, are integrated in the working groups.</p>
<p>The WGII SAR (IPCC, 1996b) reported a number of cost estimates for individual 
  climate change mitigation technologies, but did not include specific subsections 
  or extensive discussions on the cost assessment framework or methodological 
  issues related to valuation issues. This section therefore only provides a short 
  summary of the coverage of costing methodologies in the report of the social 
  and economic dimensions by WGIII (IPCC, 1996a).</p>
<p>Costing methodologies were addressed as part of several chapters in the WGIII 
  SAR (IPCC, 1996a). These included chapters on the decision-making framework, 
  equity and social considerations, and intergenerational equity: discounting 
  and economic efficiency. Furthermore, the report included two conceptual chapters 
  on cost and methodologies, namely Chapter 5 (Applicability of Techniques of 
  Cost&#150;Benefit Analysis to Climate Change) and Chapter 8 (Estimating the 
  Costs of Mitigating Greenhouse Gases). The first of these chapters included 
  a general outline of analytical approaches applied to climate change cost assessment, 
  with emphasis on cost&#150;benefit analysis and further development of this 
  framework to facilitate multi-attribute analysis. The analytical approaches 
  presented were discussed in relation to different decision frameworks and valuation 
  approaches. </p>
<p>Chapter 8 of the WGIII SAR (IPCC, 1996b) was a methodological introduction 
  to a subsequent chapter on comparative assessments of the modelling results 
  for mitigation costs. A taxonomy of the mitigation cost components applied in 
  the models was presented, including the direct engineering and financial costs 
  of specific technical measures, economic costs for a given sector, macroeconomic 
  costs, and welfare costs. The importance of different assumptions, such as development 
  patterns, technological change, and policy instruments, were then assessed in 
  relation to cost concepts and modelling approaches. Some of the focal areas 
  considered were &#147;top-down&#148; versus &#147;bottom-up&#148; models, double 
  dividend issues and no regret options, long-term projections, and special issues 
  related to mitigation-cost analysis for developing countries.</p>
<p>The WGIII SAR (IPCC, 1996a) also included an extensive review of the mitigation 
  costs for different parts of the world based on top-down and bottom-up methodologies. 
  The review, which was based on an assessment of several hundred studies, raised 
  a number of important costing issues that are critical to the further development 
  of cost concepts and models. These issues include, <i>inter alia</i>, model 
  structure, assumptions on demographic and economic growth, availability and 
  costs of technical options, timing of abatement policies, discount rate, and 
  the effect of research and development (R&amp;D).</p>
