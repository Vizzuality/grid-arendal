<h2>6.4 Interrelations Between International and National Policies, Measures, 
  and Instruments </h2>
<h3><a name="641"></a>6.4.1 Relationship Between Domestic Policies and Kyoto Mechanisms</h3>
<p>It is important to consider ways in which international and national (domestic) 
  policy instruments are likely to complement or conflict with one another in 
  achieving GHG emissions reduction commitments at least cost. A substantial number 
  of economic models suggest that use of the Kyoto mechanisms, established by 
  Articles 6, 12, and 17 of the Kyoto Protocol (see <a href="246.htm#631">Sections 
  6.3.1</a> and <a href="247.htm">6.3.2</a>), combined with efficient domestic 
  policies could significantly reduce the cost of meeting the emissions limitation 
  commitments in the Protocol.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#80","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>80</sup></small></a> 
  The results of these models rely on assumptions of perfect foresight or certainty 
  over future levels of emissions and on fully efficient domestic mitigation policies 
  in Annex I Parties. They also assume that developing countries will respond 
  to the market signal given by the international market of CERs and generate 
  CDM projects accordingly.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#81","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>81</sup></small></a> 
  Moreover, these models implicitly assume that national economies are operating 
  within an efficient market framework. However, when an inefficient market framework 
  is assumed the conclusions may differ. This is an area in which further research 
  is necessary.</p>
<p>Articles 6 and 12 of the Kyoto Protocol enable governments and entities of 
  Annex I countries to support JI projects in other Annex I countries and CDM 
  projects in non-Annex I countries, respectively, in return for emissions credits. 
  Several countries have suggested the participation of legal entities in IET, 
  although Article 17 (on IET) does not mention the participation of entities 
  in IET other than Parties (see Australia <i>et al</i>. (1998) and United Kingdom of 
  Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1998)).</p>
<p>The following discussion assumes that any supplementarity provisions are not 
  binding.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#82","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>82</sup></small></a> 
  In addition, MAC refers here to the marginal social abatement costs. Also, in 
  this discussion it is assumed that the initial market is perfect and then how 
  various factors influence this is assessed.</p>
<p>If IET under Article 17 is limited to Annex I governments, they would need 
  to trade AAUs or introduce a domestic emissions trading scheme to equate their 
  national MACs. Views differ as to whether national governments have the information 
  to equate the national MACs. Experimental evidence indicates that governments 
  have the necessary incentive when trading with other governments.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#83","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>83</sup></small></a> 
  If both Annex I governments and legal entities are allowed to engage in IET 
  under Article 17, this difference of views becomes academic as long as the domestic 
  policies allow the legal entities to use the three Kyoto mechanisms as part 
  of their compliance strategy. Government participation in the Kyoto mechanisms 
  changes the AAs available for emissions by domestic sources.</p>
<p>For entities to equalize their MACs there must exist either a fully comprehensive 
  domestic taxation system, which reflects the international price of AAUs, or 
  open access to the international emissions market for sources of emissions and 
  entities covered by domestic policies. In theory, several domestic policy regimes 
  can be envisioned that would allow entities in Annex I countries to equalize 
  their MAC so as to minimize the total cost of reduction. The implications for 
  different types of domestic policy instruments are as follows (Dutschke and 
  Michaelowa, 1998; Hahn and Stavins, 1999):<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#84","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>84</sup></small></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Domestic tradable permits</i>. The domestic tradable permit programme 
    must cover virtually all emissions sources, the cap must be set equal to the 
    national AA after trading by the government, and the participants must be 
    allowed to engage in international exchanges using the Kyoto mechanisms.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#85","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>85</sup></small></a> 
    Participants would be allowed to use CERs and ERUs from CDM and JI projects 
    towards compliance with their domestic obligations. The country could also 
    host JI projects. Participants could also buy or sell AAUs under Article 17 
    if participation by legal entities was allowed.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#86","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>86</sup></small></a><br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Domestic emissions and/or carbon tax</i>. The domestic emissions and/or 
    carbon tax must cover virtually all emissions sources, and the tax must be 
    set equal to or less than the national marginal cost of abatement after trading 
    by the government. Entities receive tax credits for CERs and ERUs, and for 
    AAUs if participation by legal entities is allowed under Article 17. The country 
    could also host JI projects.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#87","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>87</sup></small></a><br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Non-tradable permits</i>. Virtually all sources are covered by non-tradable 
    emissions limits, which allow the use of quotas to achieve compliance. The 
    total emissions allowed under the permits must be equal to or less than national 
    AAs after trading by the government. Entities could use purchased CERs and 
    ERUs&#150;and AAUs if participation by legal entities is allowed under Article 
    17&#150;towards compliance with their emissions limits. The country could 
    also host JI projects to reduce emissions below the emissions limits or to 
    enhance sinks.</li>
</ul>
<p>If sources are subject to regulations, design or performance standards, VAs, 
  or taxes and at the same time there is no permit allocated to the source, and 
  CERs, ERUs, or AAUs cannot be used for compliance, entities might still be allowed 
  to trade them on the international market, provided that the volume sold does 
  not exceed the volume of quotas acquired. Such domestic policies are unlikely 
  to equate MACs across sources and so will not result in the lowest cost of compliance 
  with the national emissions limitation commitment.</p>
<p>In practice, the combination of domestic policies and Kyoto mechanisms necessary 
  to achieve cost-effectiveness may not be implemented for at least two reasons. 
  First, use of the Kyoto mechanisms may be restricted in some countries, either 
  because supplementarity restrictions are binding or because a national government 
  that imposes an emissions tax may limit the use of the mechanisms towards compliance 
  with tax liabilities to protect its revenue.</p>
<p>Second, it is difficult to cover all sources and relevant sinks with policies 
  that provide an incentive to implement measures that equate MACs. Some sources 
  are small and are excluded for administrative reasons. Other sources, such as 
  methane emissions by livestock, are difficult to include in a trading or tax 
  regime. Thus, the overall cost-effectiveness of the system will fall short of 
  the theoretical ideal.</p>
<p>When part of the GHG emissions reduction needed to realize the Kyoto commitments 
  offers net economic benefits to the national economy, the role of the Kyoto 
  mechanisms changes significantly. Relative to a theoretical scheme of complete 
  and perfect trading, a purely national mitigation strategy would still give 
  rise to inefficiencies for individual countries or sources, as a result of differentials 
  in MACs. However, the advantages that could be obtained from eliminating such 
  inefficiencies through international mechanisms are more limited because of 
  principal-agent problems. </p>
<p>Thus, if access to the international mechanisms is limited to governments, 
  the Kyoto mechanisms are likely to be used only to reduce positive marginal 
  domestic abatement costs. And, since measures with positive costs under a regime 
  with restrictions make up only a fraction of total mitigation under an efficient 
  domestic policy, the quantitative significance of the Kyoto mechanisms is greatly 
  reduced. If access to the Kyoto mechanisms is given to individual sources, there 
  arises the potential for a second principal-agent problem in that individual 
  entities may mitigate in ways that minimize private costs but fail to minimize 
  social costs in the national economy. In this case, both international efficiency 
  and domestic efficiency are jeopardized.</p>
