<p>Global consumption of energy and associated emission of CO<sub>2</sub> continue 
  an upward trend in the 1990s (<a href="#figTS3">Figures TS.3</a> and <a href="#figTS4">TS.4</a>). 
  Fossil fuels remain the dominant form of energy utilized in the world, and energy 
  use accounts for more than two thirds of the GHG emissions addressed by the 
  Kyoto Protocol. In 1998, 143 exajoules (EJ) of oil, 82EJ of natural gas, and 
  100EJ of coal were consumed by the world&#146;s economies. Global primary energy 
  consumption grew an average of 1.3% annually between 1990 and 1998. Average 
  annual growth rates were 1.6% for developed countries and 2.3% to 5.5% for developing 
  countries between 1990 and 1998. Primary energy use for the EITs declined at 
  an annual rate of 4.7% between 1990 and 1998 owing to the loss of heavy industry, 
  the decline in overall economic activity, and restructuring of the manufacturing 
  sector. </p>
<p>Average global carbon dioxide emissions grew &#150; approximately at the same 
  rate as primary energy &#150; at a rate of 1.4% per year between 1990 and 1998, 
  which is much slower than the 2.1% per year growth seen in the 1970s and 1980s. 
  This was in large measure because of the reductions from the EITs and structural 
  changes in the industrial sector of the developed countries. Over the longer 
  term, global growth in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from energy use was 1.9% per 
  year between 1971 and 1998. In 1998, developed countries were responsible for 
  over 50% of energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which grew at a rate of 
  1.6% annually from 1990. The EITs accounted for 13% of 1998 emissions, and their 
  emissions have been declining at an annual rate of 4.6% per year since 1990. 
  Developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region emitted 22% of the global total 
  carbon dioxide, and have been the fastest growing with increases of 4.9% per 
  year since 1990. The rest of the developing countries accounted for slightly 
  more than 10% of total emissions, growing at an annual rate of 4.3% since 1990.</p>
<p>During the period of intense industrialization from 1860 to 1997, an estimated 
  13,000EJ of fossil fuel were burned, releasing 290GtC into the atmosphere, which 
  along with land-use change has raised atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  by 30%. By comparison, estimated natural gas resources<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>6</a></sup></small> 
  are comparable to those for oil, being approximately 35,000EJ. The coal resource 
  base is approximately four times as large. Methane clathrates (not counted in 
  the resource base) are estimated to be approximately 780,000EJ. Estimated fossil 
  fuel reserves contain 1,500GtC, being more than 5 times the carbon already released, 
  and if estimated resources are added, there is a total of 5,000GtC remaining 
  in the ground. The scenarios modelled by the SRES without any specific GHG emission 
  policies foresee cumulative release ranging from approximately 1,000 GtC to 
  2,100 GtC from fossil fuel consumption between 2,000 and 2,100. Cumulative carbon 
  emissions for stabilization profiles of 450 to 750 ppmv over that same period 
  are between 630 and 1,300GtC (see <a href="019.htm#figTS5">Figure TS.5</a>). 
  Fossil-fuel scarcity, at least at the global level, is therefore not a significant 
  factor in considering climate change mitigation. On the contrary, different 
  from the relatively large coal and unconventional oil and gas deposits, the 
  carbon in conventional oil and gas reserves or in conventional oil resources 
  is much less than the cumulative carbon emissions associated with stabilisation 
  at 450 ppmv or higher (<a href="019.htm#figTS5">Figure TS.5</a>). In addition, 
  there is the potential to contribute large quantities of other GHGs as well. 
  At the same time it is clear from <a href="019.htm#figTS5">Figure TS.5</a> that 
  the conventional oil and gas reserves are only a small fraction of the total 
  fossil fuel resource base. These resource data may imply a change in the energy 
  mix and the introduction of new sources of energy during the 21st century. The 
  choice of energy mix and associated investment will determine whether, and if 
  so at what level and cost, greenhouse concentrations can be stabilized. Currently 
  most such investment is directed towards discovering and developing more conventional 
  and unconventional fossil resources.<a name="figTS4"></a></p>
