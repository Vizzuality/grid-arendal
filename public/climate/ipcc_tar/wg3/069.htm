<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<h4>Introduction: Summary of the Second Assessment Report and progress since this 
  report. </h4>
<p>This chapter reviews three scenario literatures: general mitigation scenarios 
  produced since the Second Assessment Report (SAR), narrative-based scenarios 
  found in the general futures literature, and mitigation scenarios based on the 
  new reference scenarios developed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
  Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). </p>
<h4>Scenarios<br>
</h4>
<p>A long-term view of a multiplicity of future possibilities is required to consider 
  the ultimate risks of climate change, assess critical interactions with other 
  aspects of human and environmental systems and guide policy responses. Scenarios 
  offer a structured means of organizing information and gleaning insight into 
  the possibilities.</p>
<p>Each mitigation scenario describes a future world with particular economic, 
  social, and environmental characteristics, and therefore implicitly or explicitly 
  contains information about development, equity, and sustainability (DES). Since 
  the difference between reference case scenarios and their corresponding mitigation 
  scenarios is simply the addition of deliberate climate policy, it can be the 
  case that the differences in emissions among reference case scenarios are greater 
  than between any one such scenario and its mitigation version. </p>
<h4>General Greenhouse Gas Emissions Mitigation Scenarios</h4>
<p>This chapter considers the results of 519 quantitative emission scenarios from 
  188 sources, mainly produced after 1990. The review focuses on 126 mitigation 
  scenarios that cover global emissions and have a time horizon encompassing the 
  coming century.</p>
<p>These mitigation scenarios include concentration stabilization scenarios, emission 
  stabilization scenarios, tolerable windows/safe emission corridor scenarios, 
  and other mitigation scenarios. They all include energy-related carbon dioxide 
  (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions; several also include CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from 
  land-use changes and industrial processes and other important greenhouse gases 
  (GHGs). </p>
<p>Mitigation options used in the reviewed mitigation scenarios take into account 
  energy systems, industrial processes, and land use, and depend on the underlying 
  model structure. Most of the scenarios introduce simple carbon taxes or constraints 
  on emissions or concentration levels to reflect measures that are taken to implement 
  such options. Regional targets are introduced in the models with regional disaggregation. 
  Emission trading is introduced in more recent work. Some models employ supply-side 
  technology introduction, while others emphasize efficient demand-side technology 
  options.</p>
<p>Allocation of emission reduction among regions is a contentious issue. Only 
  some studies, particularly recent ones, make explicit assumptions about such 
  allocations in their scenarios. Some studies offer global emission trading as 
  a mechanism to reduce mitigation costs. </p>
<h4>Technological improvement is a critical element in all the general mitigation 
  scenarios. </h4>
<p>Detailed analysis of the characteristics of 31 scenarios for stabilization 
  at 550ppmv (and their respective baseline scenarios) yielded several insights<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a>. 
</p>
<p>There was a wide range in baselines, reflecting a diversity of assumptions, 
  mainly with respect to economic growth and low-carbon energy supply. High economic 
  growth scenarios tend to assume high levels of progress in the efficiency of 
  end-use technologies; carbon intensity reductions were found to be largely independent 
  of economic growth assumptions. The range of future trends shows greater divergence 
  in scenarios that focus on developing countries than in scenarios that look 
  at developed nations. There is little consensus with respect to future directions 
  in developing regions.</p>
<p>The reviewed 550ppmv stabilization scenarios vary with respect to reduction 
  time paths and the distribution of emission reductions among regions. Some scenarios 
  show that emission trading lowers overall mitigation cost by shifting mitigation 
  to non-OECD countries, where abatement costs are assumed to be lower. The range 
  of assumed mitigation policies is very wide. In general, scenarios in which 
  there is an assumed adoption of high-efficiency measures in the baseline show 
  less scope for further introduction of efficiency measures in the mitigation 
  scenarios. In part this is due to the structure of the models, which do not 
  assume major technological breakthroughs. Conversely, baseline scenarios with 
  high carbon intensity reductions show larger carbon intensity reductions in 
  their corresponding mitigation scenarios. Global macroeconomic costs of mitigation 
  in the reviewed scenarios range from 0% to 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), 
  while a few simple models estimate more increase in the second half of the 21<sup>st</sup> 
  century. No clear relationship was discovered between the GDP loss and the GDP 
  growth assumptions in the baselines. </p>
<p>Only a small set of studies has reported on scenarios for mitigating non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  gases. This literature suggests that small reductions of GHG emissions can be 
  accomplished at lower cost by including non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases; that both 
  CO<sub>2</sub> and non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would have to be controlled 
  in order to reduce emissions sufficiently to meet assumed mitigation targets; 
  and that methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) mitigation can be carried out more rapidly, 
  with a more immediate impact on the atmosphere, than CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation.</p>
<p>In most cases it is clear that mitigation scenarios and mitigation policies 
  are strongly related to their baseline scenarios, but no systematic analysis 
  in this class of literature has been published on the relationship between mitigation 
  and baseline scenarios.<br>
</p>
<h4>Global Futures Scenarios</h4>
<p>Global futures scenarios do not specifically or uniquely consider GHG emissions. 
  Instead, they are more general &#147;stories&#148; of possible future worlds. 
  They can complement the more quantitative emission scenario assessment because 
  they consider dimensions that elude quantification, such as governance and social 
  structures and institutions, but which are nonetheless important to the success 
  of mitigation policies. Addressing these issues reflects the different perspectives 
  presented in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 1</a> on cost-effectiveness, equity, 
  and sustainability.</p>
<p>A survey of this literature has yielded a number of insights. First, a wide 
  range of future conditions has been identified by futurists, ranging from variants 
  of sustainable development to collapse of social, economic, and environmental 
  systems. Since the underlying socio-economic drivers of emissions may vary widely 
  in the future, it is important that climate policies should be designed so that 
  they are resilient against widely different future conditions.</p>
<p>Second, the global futures scenarios that show falling GHG emissions tend to 
  show improved governance, increased equity and political participation, reduced 
  conflict, and improved environmental quality. They also tend to show increased 
  energy efficiency, shifts to non-fossil energy sources, and/or shifts to a post-industrial 
  economy. Furthermore, population tends to stabilize at relatively low levels, 
  in many cases as a result of increased prosperity, expanded provision of family 
  planning, and improved rights and opportunities for women. A key implication 
  is that sustainable development policies can make a significant contribution 
  to emission reduction. </p>
<p>Third, different combinations of driving forces are consistent with low emission 
  scenarios. The implication of this would seem to be that it is important to 
  consider the linkage between climate policy and other policies and conditions 
  associated with the choice of future paths in a general sense. </p>
<h4>Special Report on Emission Scenarios</h4>
<p>Six new GHG emission reference scenario groups (not including specific climate 
  policy initiatives), organised into 4 scenario &#147;families&#148;, were developed 
  by the IPCC and published as the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). 
  Scenario families A1 and A2 emphasize economic development but differ with respect 
  to the degree of economic and social convergence; B1 and B2 emphasize sustainable 
  development but also differ in terms of degree of convergence. In all, six models 
  were used to generate 40 scenarios that comprise the six scenario groups. In 
  each group of scenarios, which should be considered equally sound, one illustrative 
  case was chosen to illustrate the whole set of scenarios. These six scenarios 
  include marker scenarios for each of the scenario families as well as two scenarios, 
  A1FI and A1T, which illustrate alternative energy technology developments in 
  the A1 world.</p>
<p>The SRES scenarios lead to the following findings:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Alternative combinations of driving-force variables can lead to similar 
    levels and structure of energy use, land-use patterns and emissions.<br>
  <li>Important possibilities for further bifurcations in future development trends 
    exist within each scenario family.<br>
  <li>Emissions profiles are dynamic across the range of SRES scenarios. They 
    portray trend reversals and indicate possible emissions cross-over among different 
    scenarios. <br>
  <li>Describing potential future developments involves inherent ambiguities and 
    uncertainties. One and only one possible development path (as alluded to for 
    instance in concepts such as &#147;business-as-usual scenario&#148;) simply 
    does not exist. The multi-model approach increases the value of any scenario 
    set, since uncertainties in the choice of model input assumptions can be more 
    explicitly separated from the specific model behaviour and related modelling 
    uncertainties. 
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Review of Post-SRES Mitigation Scenarios</h4>
<p>Recognizing the importance of multiple baselines in evaluating mitigation strategies, 
  recent studies analyze and compare mitigation scenarios using as their baselines 
  the new SRES scenarios. This allows for the assessment in this report of 76 
  &#147;Post-SRES Mitigation Scenarios&#148; produced by nine modelling teams.</p>
<p>These mitigation scenarios were quantified on the basis of storylines for each 
  of the six SRES scenarios which describe the relationship between the kind of 
  future world and its capacity for mitigation.</p>
<p>Quantifications differ with respect to the baseline scenario including assumed 
  storyline, the stabilization target, and the model that was used. The post-SRES 
  scenarios cover a very wide range of emission trajectories but the range is 
  clearly below the SRES range. All scenarios show an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> 
  reduction over time. Energy reduction shows a much wider range than CO<sub>2</sub> 
  reduction, because in many scenarios a decoupling between energy use and carbon 
  emissions takes place as a result of a shift in primary energy sources.</p>
<p>In general, the lower the stabilization target and the higher the level of 
  baseline emissions, the larger the CO<sub>2</sub> divergence from the baseline 
  that is needed, and the earlier that it must occur. The A1FI, A1B, and A2 worlds 
  require a wider range and more strongly implemented technology and/or policy 
  measures than A1T, B1, and B2. The 450 ppmv stabilization case requires very 
  rapid emission reduction over the next 20 to 30 years.</p>
<p>A key policy question is what kind of emission reductions in the medium term 
  (after the Kyoto protocol commitment period) would be needed. Analysis of the 
  post-SRES scenarios (most of which assume developing country emissions to be 
  below baselines by 2020) suggests that stabilization at 450ppmv will require 
  emissions reductions in Annex I countries after 2012 
  that go significantly beyond their Kyoto Protocol commitments. It also suggests 
  that it would not be necessary to go much beyond the Kyoto commitments for Annex 
  I countries by 2020 to achieve stabilization at 550ppmv or higher. However, 
  it should be recognized that several scenarios indicate the need for significant 
  Annex I emission reductions by 2020 and that none of 
  the scenarios introduces other constraints such as a limit to the rate of temperature 
  change.</p>
<p>An important policy question already mentioned concerns the participation of 
  developing countries in emission mitigation. A preliminary finding of the post-SRES 
  scenario analysis is that, if it is assumed that the CO<sub>2</sub> emission 
  reduction needed for stabilization would occur in Annex 
  I countries only, Annex I per capita CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions would fall below non-Annex I per capita emissions 
  during the 21<sup>st</sup> century in nearly all of the stabilization scenarios, 
  and before 2050 in two-thirds of the scenarios. This suggests that the stabilization 
  target and the baseline emission level are both important determinants of the 
  timing when developing countries&#146; emissions might need to diverge from 
  their baseline. </p>
<p>Climate policy would reduce per capita final energy consumption in the economy-emphasized 
  worlds (A1FI, A1B, and A2), but not in the environment-emphasized worlds (B1 
  and B2). The reduction in energy use caused by climate policies would be larger 
  in Annex I than in non-Annex I. 
  However, the impact of climate policies on equity in per capita final energy 
  use would be much smaller than that of the future development path. </p>
<p>No single measure will be sufficient for the timely development, adoption, 
  and diffusion of mitigation options to stabilize atmospheric GHGs. Instead, 
  a portfolio based on technological change, economic incentives, and institutional 
  frameworks could be adopted. Combined use of a broad array of known technological 
  options has a long-term potential which, in combination with associated socio-economic 
  and institutional changes, is sufficient to achieve stabilization of atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the range of 450&#150;550ppmv or below. </p>
<p>Assumed mitigation options differ among scenarios and are strongly dependent 
  on the model structure. However, common features of mitigation scenarios include 
  large and continuous energy efficiency improvements and afforestation as well 
  as low-carbon energy, especially biomass, over the next one hundred years and 
  natural gas in the first half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Energy conservation 
  and reforestation are reasonable first steps, but innovative supply-side technologies 
  will eventually be required. Possible robust options include using natural gas 
  and combined-cycle technology to bridge the transition to more advanced fossil 
  fuel and zero-carbon technologies, such as hydrogen fuel cells. Solar energy 
  along with either nuclear energy or carbon removal and storage would become 
  increasingly important for a higher emission world or lower stabilization target. 
</p>
<p>Integration between global climate policies and domestic air pollution abatement 
  policies could effectively reduce GHG emissions in developing regions for the 
  next two or three decades; however, control of sulphur emissions could amplify 
  possible climate change, and partial trade-offs are likely to persist for environmental 
  policies in the medium term.</p>
<p>Policies governing agriculture and land use and energy systems need to be linked 
  for climate change mitigation. Supply of biomass energy as well as biological 
  CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration would broaden the available options for carbon 
  emission reductions, although the post-SRES scenarios show that they cannot 
  provide the bulk of the emission reductions required. That has to come from 
  other options.</p>
