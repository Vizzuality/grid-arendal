<h4>5.4.2.2 Opportunities for Mitigation </h4>
<p>Some of the most promising opportunities for GHG mitigation in the transport 
  sector are linked to the growing need for action to address a wider range of 
  concerns about the sector&#146;s social and environmental impacts. Several studies 
  have evaluated environmental and social externalities associated with road transport 
  (IPCC, 1996; ECMT, 1997; OECD, 1997a). Some have explored the effects of internalizing 
  those costs through fuel taxes and other measures (EC, 1996; Michaelis, 1996b; 
  ECMT, 1997). However, transport fuel taxes have proved very unpopular in some 
  countries, especially where they are seen as revenue-raising measures (MVA, 
  1995), and may be an inefficient means of internalizing environmental costs 
  other than those associated with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions. 
  Charges on road users, including parking fees in many towns and tolls, especially 
  on motorways, have been accepted where they are earmarked to cover the costs 
  of road provision (Michaelis, 1997a). Several studies have explored the potential 
  for adjusting the way existing road taxes, license fees, and insurance premiums 
  are levied, and have found potential emissions reductions in the region of 10% 
  in OECD countries (Wenzel, 1995; Michaelis, 1996b). </p>
<p>While it may be possible to adjust the price incentives in the transport sector, 
  overcoming the many forms of inertia and lock-in is more difficult. Effective 
  mitigation strategies would entail combinations of measures, just as the status 
  quo is currently maintained by a combination of forces (IPCC, 1996). Often, 
  the best opportunities for such concerted action arise at a local level, where 
  the negative impacts of transport are most keenly felt (Michaelis, 1997a). There 
  are several positive experiences of change, such as a Scottish example where 
  a public consultation process led to a large shift in local government spending 
  towards public transport (Macaulay <i>et al</i>., 1993), initiatives to introduce toll 
  rings around Norwegian cities, and the comprehensive transport strategies in 
  Singapore (Ang, 1993), Curitiba (Rabinovitch, 1993), and other cities (IPCC, 
  1996).</p>
<p>Achieving the promise of new technology may depend on international co-operation 
  to develop larger markets for low-GHG-emission vehicles through fiscal and regulatory 
  measures and public purchasing. During high oil price periods, car importing 
  countries have imposed restrictions and incentives on car importers to discourage 
  the use of more energy-intensive cars. Agricultural surpluses and foreign exchange 
  shortages have been important stimuli for technology development in the past, 
  in particular in the case of the Brazilian ethanol programme.</p>
<p>While several studies have found that people living in denser and more compact 
  cities rely less on cars (Armstrong, 1993), energy savings alone are unlikely 
  to motivate the shift away from suburban sprawl to compact cities advocated 
  by Newman and Kenworthy (1990). However, there is a growing concern to reverse 
  the decline in the environment and in communities in city centres by moving 
  away from zoning and car-based transport, and towards multi-function, high-density 
  pedestrian zones. There is a considerable opportunity for GHG mitigation in 
  linking to this concern. In particular, there is scope where infrastructure 
  is developing rapidly to implement planning measures that encourage more sustainable 
  transport patterns, avoiding the pollution, congestion, higher accident rates, 
  and GHG emissions associated with cars.</p>
