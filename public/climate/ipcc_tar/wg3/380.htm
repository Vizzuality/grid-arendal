<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p><b>Scope for and New Developments in Analyses for Climate Change Decisions</b></p>
<p>Climate change is profoundly different from most other environmental problems 
  with which humanity has grappled. A combination of several features gives the 
  climate problem its unique feature, which include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>public good issues that arise from the concentration of greenhouse gases 
    (GHGs) in the atmosphere (and require collective global action);<br>
  </li>
  <li>the multiplicity of decision makers (ranging from global decision-making 
    frameworks (DMFs) down to the micro-level of firms and individuals);<br>
  </li>
  <li>the heterogeneity of emissions; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>the consequences of emissions around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, the long-term nature of climate change originates because it is the 
  concentration of GHGs that is important, rather than annual emissions; this 
  feature raises the thorny issues of intergenerational transfers of wealth and 
  environmental good and bad outcomes. Next, human activities associated with 
  climate change are so widespread that narrowly defined technological solutions 
  are impossible and the interactions of climate policy with other broad socioeconomic 
  policies are strong. Finally, large uncertainties or in some areas even ignorance 
  characterize many aspects of the problem and require a risk management approach 
  to be adopted in all DMFs that deal with climate change.</p>
<p>Experiments with cost&#150;benefit models framed as a Bayesian decision-analysis 
  problem show that optimal near-term (next two decades) emission paths diverge 
  only modestly with perfect foresight and even with hedging for low-probability, 
  high-consequence scenarios. Cost-effectiveness analyses seek the lowest cost 
  that will achieve an environmental target by equalizing the marginal costs of 
  mitigation across space and time. Long-term cost-effectiveness studies estimate 
  the costs to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations 
  at different levels. While there is a moderate increase in the costs when passing 
  from a 750 ppmv to a 550 ppmv concentration stabilization level, there is a 
  larger increase in costs passing from 550 ppmv to 450 ppmv unless the emissions 
  in the baseline scenario are very low. The total costs of stabilizing atmospheric 
  carbon concentrations are very dependent on the baseline scenario: for example, 
  for scenarios focusing on the local and regional aspects of sustainable development 
  costs are lower than for other scenarios. Rather than seeking a single optimal 
  path, the tolerable windows or safe landing approaches seek to delineate the 
  complete array of possible emission paths that satisfy externally defined climate 
  impact and emission cost constraints. Results indicate that a delay in near-term 
  effective emission reductions can drastically reduce the future range of options 
  for relatively tight climate change targets. Less tight targets offer more near-term 
  flexibility.</p>
<p><b>International Regimes and Policy Options</b></p>
<p>Different mitigation policy options include the timing of responses to climate 
  change, the choice between mitigation and adaptation responses, the role of 
  technological innovation and diffusion, the choice between domestic action and 
  the adoption of international mechanisms, the combination of climate change 
  mitigation with actions towards other environmental or socio-economic objectives, 
  and others. The costs and benefits of these crucially depend on the characteristics 
  of the international agreement on climate change that is adopted. In particular, 
  they depend upon two main features of the international regime: the number of 
  signatories, and the size of their quantitative commitment to control GHG emissions. 
  The number of signatories depends on how equitably the commitments of the participants 
  are shared. Cost-effectiveness (minimizing costs by maximizing participation) 
  and equity (the allocation of emissions limitation commitments) are therefore 
  strongly linked.</p>
<p>There is therefore a three-way relationship between the design of the international 
  regime, the cost-efficiency of climate policies, and the equity of the consequent 
  economic outcomes. Thus, it is crucial to design the international regime in 
  a way that increases both its efficiency and its equity. The literature presents 
  different strategies to optimize an international regime. For example, countries 
  can be encouraged to participate in an international group committed to specific 
  emissions limits and targets if the equity (and therefore efficiency) is increased 
  by a larger agreement. This may include measures like an appropriate distribution 
  of targets over time, the linkage of the climate debate with other issues (&#147;issue 
  linkage&#147;), the use of financial transfers to affected countries (&#147;side 
  payments&#148;), and technology transfer agreements.</p>
