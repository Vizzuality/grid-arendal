<p><a name="fig51"></a>The transfer of technologies and practices that have the

  that slow their penetration. The opportunity<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn5.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>2</sup></small></a> 
  to mitigate GHG concentrations by removing or modifying barriers to the spread 
  of technology may be viewed within a framework of different potentials for GHG 
  mitigation (<a href="#fig51">Figure 5.1</a>). The &#147;market potential&#148; 
  indicates the amount of GHG mitigation that might be achieved under forecast 
  market conditions, with no changes in policy or implementation of measures whose 
  primary purpose is the mitigation of GHGs. The market potential can be close 
  to zero as a result of extreme poverty, absence of markets, and remoteness of 
  communities. The inability of the poor or isolated communities to access modern 
  energy services reflects this situation. Because interventions to address poverty 
  fall outside the immediate scope of this chapter, they receive only limited 
  treatment here despite the intrinsic general importance of the subject.</p>
<p>In addition to the market potential, there is also the economic potential and 
  the socioeconomic potential to be considered. Eliminating imperfections of markets, 
  public policies, and other institutions that inhibit the diffusion of technologies 
  that are (or are projected to be) cost-effective for consumers (evaluated using 
  consumers&#146; private rate of time discounting and prices) without reference 
  to any GHG benefits they may generate would increase GHG mitigation to the level 
  defined as the &#147;economic potential&#148;. The &#147;socioeconomic&#148; 
  potential consists of barriers derived from people&#146;s individual habits, 
  attitudes and social norms, and vested interests in the diffusion of new technology. 
  This potential represents the level of GHG mitigation that would be achieved 
  if technologies that are cost effective from a societal perspective are implemented. 
</p>
<p>Finally, some technologies might not be widely used simply because they are 
  too expensive from a societal perspective. This leads to the level of the &#147;technical 
  potential&#148;, which can be improved upon by solving scientific and technological 
  problems. Policies to overcome this category of barriers must be aimed at fostering 
  research and development (R&amp;D). </p>
<p>Technological and social innovation is a complex process of research, experimentation, 
  learning, and development that can contribute to GHG mitigation. Several theories 
  and models have been developed to understand its features, drivers, and implications. 
  New knowledge and human capital may result from R&amp;D spending, through learning 
  by doing, and/or in an evolutionary process. Most innovations require some social 
  or behavioural change on the part of users. Rapidly changing economies, as well 
  as social and institutional structures offer opportunities for locking-in to 
  GHG-mitigative technologies that may lead countries on to sustainable development 
  pathways. The pathways will be influenced by the particular socioeconomic context 
  that reflects prices, financing, international trade, market structure, institutions, 
  the provision of information, and social, cultural and behavioural factors; 
  key elements of which are described below.</p>
<p><i>Unstable Macroeconomic Conditions</i><br>
  Such conditions increase risk to private investment and finance. Unsound government 
  borrowing and fiscal policy lead to chronic public deficits, reducing the availability 
  of credit to the private sector. Trade barriers that favour inefficient technologies, 
  or prevent access to advanced knowledge and hardware, can slow the diffusion 
  of mitigation options. </p>
<p><i>Commercial Financing Institutions </i><br>
  These institutions face high risks when developing &#147;green&#148; financial 
  products. Innovative approaches in the private sector to address this and other 
  issues include leasing, environmental and ethical banks, micro-credits or small 
  grants facilities targeted at low income households, environmental funds, energy 
  service companies (ESCOs), and green venture capital. </p>
<p><i>Distorted or Incomplete Prices</i><br>
  The absence of a market price for certain impacts, such as environmental harm, 
  can constitute a barrier to the diffusion of environmentally beneficial technologies. 
  Distortion of prices arising from taxes, subsidies, or other policy interventions 
  that make resource consumption more or less expensive to consumers can also 
  impede the diffusion of resource-conserving technologies. </p>
<p><i>Information as a Public Good</i><br>
  Generic information regarding the availability of different kinds of technologies 
  and their performance characteristics has the attributes of a &#147;public good&#148; 
  and hence may be underprovided by the private market. </p>
<p><br>
  <i>Lack of Effective Regulatory Agencies</i><b> </b><br>
  Many countries have on their books excellent constitutional and legal provisions 
  for environmental protection but the latter are not enforced. However, &#147;informal 
  regulation&#148; under community pressure may substitute for formal regulatory 
  pressure. </p>
<p><i>Lifestyles, Behaviours, and Consumption Patterns</i><br>
  These have developed within current and historical socio-cultural contexts. 
  Changes in behaviour and lifestyles may result from a number of intertwined 
  processes. Barriers take various forms in association with each of the above 
  processes. </p>
<p><i>Conventional Policy Development</i><br>
  This type of development is based on a model of human psychology, where people 
  are assumed to be rational welfare-maximizers, that has been widely criticized. 
  Such a model does not explain processes, such as learning, habituation, value 
  formation, or the bounded rationality observed in human choice. </p>
<p><i>Buildings</i><br>
  The poor in every country are affected far more by barriers in this sector than 
  the rich, because of inadequate access to financing, low literacy rates, adherence 
  to traditional customs, and the need to devote a higher fraction of income to 
  satisfy basic needs, including fuel purchases. </p>
<p>Measures to overcome these barriers that have been implemented include voluntary 
  programmes, building efficiency standards, equipment efficiency standards, state 
  market transformation programmes, financing, government procurement, tax credits, 
  accelerated R&amp;D, and a carbon cap and trade system. </p>
<p><i>Transport</i><b> </b><br>
  The low relative cost of fuel, split incentives, a perception that the car is 
  more convenient or economical than alternatives, are some of the barriers that 
  slow the use of mitigation technologies in this sector. The car has also become 
  charged with significance as a means of freedom, mobility and safety, a symbol 
  of personal status and identity, and as one of the most important products in 
  the industrial economy. A combination of policies protecting road transport 
  interests, rather than any single policy, poses the greatest barrier to change.</p>
<p><i>Industry</i><br>
  Barriers include the high transaction costs for obtaining reliable information, 
  the use of capital for competing investment priorities, high-hurdle rates for 
  energy efficiency investments, lack of skilled personnel for small and medium-sized 
  enterprises (SMEs), and the low relative cost of energy. Information programmes, 
  environmental legislation, and voluntary agreements have been used and tested 
  in developed countries with varying rates of success in reducing barriers. </p>
<p><i>Energy Supply</i><br>
  The increasing deregulation of energy supply has raised particular concerns. 
  Volatile spot and contract prices, short-term outlook of private investors, 
  and the perceived risks of nuclear and hydropower plants have shifted fuel and 
  technology choice towards natural gas and oil plants, and away from hydro in 
  many countries. Co-generation is hampered by lack of information, the decentralized 
  character of the technology, the hostile attitude of grid operators, the terms 
  of grid connection, and lack of policies that foster long-term planning. Firm 
  public policy and regulatory authority are necessary to install and safeguard 
  harmonized conditions, transparency, and unbundling of the main power supply 
  functions.</p>
<p><i>Agriculture and Forestry</i><br>
  Adoption of new technology is limited by small farm size, credit constraints, 
  risk aversion, lack of access to information and human capital, inadequate rural 
  infrastructure and tenurial arrangements, and unreliable supply of complementary 
  inputs. Subsidies for critical inputs to agriculture, such as fertilizers, water 
  supply, and electricity and fuels, and to outputs in order to maintain stable 
  agricultural systems and an equitable distribution of wealth distort markets 
  for these products. In relation to climate change mitigation, other issues such 
  as lack of technical capability, lack of credibility about setting project baselines, 
  and monitoring of carbon stocks pose difficult challenges. </p>
<p><i>Waste Management</i><br>
  The principal barriers to technology transfer include limited financing and 
  institutional capability, jurisdictional complexity, and the need for community 
  involvement. Climate change mitigation projects face further barriers owing 
  to the unfamiliarity with methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) capture and potential electricity 
  generation, unwillingness to commit additional human capacity for climate mitigation, 
  and the involvement of diverse institutions at all levels.</p>
<p><i>Regional Considerations</i><br>
  Changing global patterns provide an opportunity for introducing GHG mitigation 
  technologies and practices that are consistent with development, equity, and 
  sustainability (DES) goals. A culture of energy subsidies, institutional inertia, 
  fragmented capital markets, vested interests, etc., however, presents major 
  barriers to their implementation in the developing countries and those with 
  economies in transition (EIT). Situations in these two groups of countries call 
  for a more careful analysis of trade, institutional, financial, and income barriers 
  and opportunities; distorted prices and information gaps. In the developed countries, 
  other barriers such as the current carbon-intensive lifestyle and consumption 
  patterns, social structures, network externalities, and misplaced incentives 
  offer opportunities for intervention to control the growth of GHG emissions. 
  Lastly, new and used technologies mostly flow from the developed to developing 
  and transitioning countries. A global approach to reducing emissions that targets 
  technology being transferred from developed to developing countries could have 
  a significant impact on future emissions. <br>
