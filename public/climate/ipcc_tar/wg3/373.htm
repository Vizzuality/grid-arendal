<h2>9.3 International Spillovers from Mitigation Strategies <br>
</h2>
<p>International spillovers<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>10</sup></small></a> 
  arise when mitigation in one country has an impact on sectors in other countries. 
  The main factors are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>improvement in the performance or reduction in the cost of low-carbon technologies; 
  </li>
  <li>changes in the international prices, exports and outputs of fossil fuels, 
    especially oil; and</li>
  <li>relocation of energy-intensive industries.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#tab98">Table 9.8</a> shows how different policies and measures may 
  give rise to such spillovers. These effects may be included in the design and 
  assessment of policies, particularly in the search for internationally equitable 
  strategies. <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> considers the macro aspects of spillovers; 
  this section considers the sectoral aspects.</p>

<h3><a name="931"></a>9.3.1 Technology Policies<br>
</h3>
<p>In the sectoral perspective of this chapter, it appears that there are three 
  routes by which technology policies in one country affect sectoral development 
  in others. First, R&amp;D may increase the knowledge base and this will benefit 
  every country. Second, increased &#147;market access&#148; for low-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  technologies, through niche-markets or preferential buyback rates in one country 
  may induce a generic improvement in technology in others. <a href="#box91">Box 
  9.1</a> explains how this process can be modelled. Third, domestic regulations 
  on performance and standards, whether imposed or voluntary can create a strong 
  signal for foreign industrial competitors (Gruber <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1997). 
  For example, the ratio of emission standards for carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, 
  and NO<sub>x</sub> for automobiles in the EU relative to those in the US has 
  been reduced from a factor of more than 3 in the seventies to a factor 1.5 to 
  2 in the nineties (Anderson, 1990; IFP, 1998). </p>

      <p align="left"><b>Box 9.1. International Technological Spillovers in the 
        National Energy Modelling System Model of the US Energy Sector</b></p>
      <p>The rate of international spillovers largely depends on the nature of 
        the technology, the degree of internalization of the market, and the competitive 
        structure of the industry. The NEMS model of the US energy sector is one 
        of the rare models explicitly incorporating spillover effects. It is assumed, 
        based on historical experience, that power plant development outside the 
        US will also help to decrease costs in the USA. Thus, one unit installed 
        abroad is incorporated in the experience curve, but only up to a fraction 
        of the same unit in the USA. The corresponding factor (from 0 to 1) depends 
        on the proximity of the country and firm developing this power plant. 
        It gives the measure of the expected international spillover rate (NEMS 
        model documentation, DOE-EIA; see Kydes, 1999).<br>

<h3> <a name="932"></a>9.3.2 Tax and Subsidy Policies</h3>
<p>Spillover effects from tax and subsidy policies for mitigation are less direct. 
  The global economic impacts of the policies are examined, both in a theoretical 
  and in a modelling perspective, in <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> (<a href="344.htm">8.3.2.1</a> 
  to <a href="345.htm#8324">8.3.2.4</a>). Their impacts on sectors are also analyzed 
  in <a href="356.htm">section 9.2</a> above. The sectoral effects of these policies 
  can be summarized as follows.<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li> They will reduce the demand for carbon-based fuels, and thus introduce 
    a downward pressure on their prices e.g., in the world price of crude oil;</li>
  <li>They may reduce the industrial competitiveness of sectors with higher costs 
    in the mitigating country, raising competitiveness and hence market shares 
    for sectors in other countries;</li>
  <li>They may create an incentive to industrial relocation and thus give rise 
    to &#147;carbon leakages&#148;; </li>
  <li>However, they may also stimulate the development of alternative technological 
    solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The effects of carbon taxation on international competitiveness are reviewed 
  by Ekins and Speck (1998) and Barker and Johnstone (1998). Clearly, a carbon 
  tax will raise the cost of production of some sectors of the economy, causing 
  some consumers to switch from their products to the products of the sectors 
  in other countries, changing international trade. National losses (and/or gains) 
  for price competitiveness will be the net sum of the sectors&#146; losses (and/or 
  gains) for price competitiveness. The outcome for a particular sector will depend 
  on the policy instruments used, how any tax revenue has been recycled, and whether 
  the exchange rate has adjusted to compensate at the national level. The conclusions 
  from these surveys are that the reported effects on international competitiveness 
  are very small, and that at the firm and sector level, given well-designed policies, 
  there will not be significant loss of competitiveness from tax-based policies 
  to achieve targets similar to those of the Kyoto Protocol.<br>
</p>
<p>These conclusions are confirmed by later studies, although in general the effects 
  of environmental taxation in one country on sectors in other countries are not 
  well covered by the literature. Using an econometric model (E3ME), Barker (1998a) 
  assesses policies reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 11 EU member states at 
  the level of 30 industries and 17 fuel users, comparing unilateral with co-ordinated 
  policies. The carbon tax reduces imports of oil and increases imports of carbon-intensive 
  products. However, the results for trade are negligible. <br>
  <br>
  Ban (1998) assesses the effects of an ad-valorem tax on coal (20%), oil (10%), 
  and gas (10%) using an applied general equilibrium model (GTAP) with 12 world 
  regions and 14 industry sectors. He has three taxation cases, (a) Japan only, 
  (b) OECD only, and (c) the world, with revenues used to increase government 
  expenditure. The results are all shown against a reference case for 1992. <a href="#tab99">Table 
  9.9</a> shows the effects on the industrial output in Japan: the effects are 
  very small when the tax is for Japan only, but they are even smaller when the 
  taxation is at the OECD or world level, illustrating the size of the competitiveness 
  effects. These results depend critically on the assumptions adopted as Ban points 
  out.</p>

<p>There are other aspects to spillovers not well captured in existing models. 
  As energy efficiency is generally higher in Annex B countries than in the rest 
  of the world, some studies suggest that relocation of industry to developing 
  regions would increase global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (e.g., Shinozaki <i><i>et 
  al</i></i>., 1998). However, this conclusion would be altered if the relocated 
  industry used up-to-date technologies rather than the average technology in 
  developing countries. The international diffusion of improved technologies in 
  response to CO<sub>2</sub> constraints is not captured in existing models and 
  would tend to counteract the negative environmental aspects of spillovers.</p>
