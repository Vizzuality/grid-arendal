<h2><a name="62"></a>6.2 National Policies, Measures, and Instruments</h2>
<p>In the case of countries in the process of structural reform, it is important 
  to understand the new policy context to develop reasonable assessments of the 
  feasibility of implementing GHG mitigation policies. Recent measures taken to 
  liberalize energy markets have been inspired for the most part by desires to 
  increase competition in energy and power markets, but they also can have significant 
  emission implications, through their impact on the production and technology 
  pattern of energy or power supply. In the long run, the consumption pattern 
  change might be more important than the sole implementation of climate change 
  mitigation measures.</p>
<p>Market-based instruments &#150; principally domestic taxes and domestic tradable 
  permit systems &#150; will be attractive to governments in many cases because 
  they are efficient. They will frequently be introduced in concert with conventional 
  regulatory measures. When implementing a domestic emissions tax, policymakers 
  must consider the collection point, the tax base, the variation among sectors, 
  the association with trade, employment, revenue, and the exact form of the mechanism. 
  Each of these can influence the appropriate design of a domestic emissions tax, 
  and political or other concerns are likely to play a role as well. For example, 
  a tax levied on the energy content of fuels could be much more costly than a 
  carbon tax for equivalent emissions reduction, because an energy tax raises 
  the price of all forms of energy, regardless of their contribution to CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions. Yet, many nations may choose to use energy taxes for reasons other 
  than cost effectiveness, and much of the analysis in this section applies to 
  energy taxes, as well as carbon taxes.</p>
<p>A country committed to a limit on its GHG emissions also can meet this limit 
  by implementing a tradable permit system that directly or indirectly limits 
  emissions of domestic sources. Like a tax, a tradable permit system poses a 
  number of design issues, including type of permit, ways to allocate permits, 
  sources included, point of compliance, and use of banking. To be able to cover 
  all sources with a single domestic permit regime is unlikely. The certainty 
  provided by a tradable permit system of achieving a given emissions level for 
  participating sources comes at the cost of the uncertainty of permit prices 
  (and hence compliance costs). To address this concern, a hybrid policy that 
  caps compliance costs could be adopted, but the level of emissions would no 
  longer be guaranteed.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, in most countries the management of GHG emissions 
  will not be addressed with a single policy instrument, but with a portfolio 
  of instruments. In addition to one or more market-based policies, a portfolio 
  might include standards and other regulations, voluntary agreements, and information 
  programmes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Energy efficiency standards have been effective in reducing energy use in 
    a growing number of countries. They may be especially effective in many countries 
    where the capacity to administer market instruments is relatively limited, 
    thereby helping to develop this administrative infrastructure. They need updating 
    to remain effective. The main disadvantage of standards is that they can be 
    inefficient, but efficiency can be improved if the standard focuses on the 
    desired results and leaves as much flexibility as possible in the choice of 
    how to achieve the results.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Voluntary agreements (VAs) may take a variety of forms. Proponents of VAs 
    point to low transaction costs and consensus elements, while sceptics emphasize 
    the risk of &#147;free riding&#148;, and the risk that the private sector 
    will not pursue real emissions reduction in the absence of monitoring and 
    enforcement. Voluntary agreements sometimes precede the introduction of more 
    stringent measures.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Imperfect information is widely recognized as a key market failure that 
    can have significant effects on improved energy efficiency, and hence emissions. 
    Information instruments include environmental labelling, energy audits, and 
    industrial reporting requirements, and information campaigns are marketing 
    elements in many energy-efficiency programmes. </li>
</ul>
<p>A growing literature has demonstrated theoretically, and with numerical simulation 
  models, that the economics of addressing GHG reduction targets with domestic 
  policy instruments depend strongly on the choice of those instruments. Price-based 
  policies tend to lead to positive marginal and positive total mitigation costs. 
  In each case, the interaction of these abatement costs with the existing tax 
  structure and, more generally, with existing factor prices is important. Price-based 
  policies that generate revenues can be coupled with measures to improve market 
  efficiency. However, the role of non-price policies, which affect the sign of 
  the change in the unit price of energy services, often remains decisive.</p>
