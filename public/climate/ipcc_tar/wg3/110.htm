<h3>3.5.4 Emission Reduction Options for Non-CO<sub>2</sub> Greenhouse Gases</h3>
<p>Non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases from manufacturing (HFCs, PFCs, SF<sub>6</sub>, and 
  N<sub>2</sub>O) are increasingand. Furthermore, PFCs and SF6 have extremely 
  long atmospheric lifetimes (thousands of years) and GWP values (thousands of 
  times those of CO<sub>2</sub>) resulting in virtually irreversible atmospheric 
  impacts. Fortunately, there are technically-feasible, low cost emission reduction 
  options available for a number of applications. Since the SAR, implementation 
  of major technological advances have led to significant emission reductions 
  of N<sub>2</sub>O and the fluorinated greenhouse gases produced as unintended 
  by-products. For the case of fluorinated gases being used as working fluids 
  or process gases, process changes, improved containment and recovery, and use 
  of alternative compounds and technologies have been adopted. On-going research 
  and development efforts are expected to further expand emission reduction options. 
  Energy efficiency improvements are also being achieved in some refrigeration 
  and foam insulation applications, which use fluorinated gases. Emission reduction 
  options by sector are highlighted below. The <a href="142.htm">Chapter 3 
  Appendix</a> reviews use and emissions of HFCs and PFCs being used as substitutes 
  for ozone-depleting substances. </p>

<h4>3.5.4.1 Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Industrial Processes</h4>
<p>Adipic acid production. Various techniques, like thermal and catalytic destruction, 
  are available to reduce emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O by 90% &#150; 98% (Reimer 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000). Reimer <i>et al</i>. (2000) report costs of catalytic destruction to 
  be between US$20 and US$60/tN<sub>2</sub>O, which is less than US$1/tC<sub>eq</sub>. 
  Costs of thermal destruction in boilers are even lower. The inter-industry group 
  of five major adipic acid manufacturers worldwide in 1991 to 1993 have agreed 
  on information exchange and on a substantial emission cut before the year 2000. 
  These major producers probably will have reduced their joint emissions by 91%. 
  It is estimated that emissions from the 24 plants producing adipic acid worldwide 
  will be reduced by 62% in the year 2000 compared to 1990 (Reimer <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Nitric acid production. Concentrations of N<sub>2</sub>O in nitric acid production 
  off-gases are lower than in the case of adipic acid production. Catalytic destruction 
  seems to be the most promising option for emission reduction. Catalysts for 
  this purpose are under development in a few places in the world. Oonk and Sch&ouml;ffel 
  (1999) estimate that emissions can be reduced to a large extent at costs between 
  US$2 and US$10/tC<sub>eq</sub>.</p>

<h4>3.5.4.2 PFC Emissions from Aluminium Production</h4>
<p>The smelting process entails electrolytic reduction of alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) 
  to produce aluminium (Al). The smelter pot contains alumina dissolved in an 
  electrolyte, which mainly consists of molten cryolite (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>). 
  Normal smelting is interrupted by an &#147;anode effect&#148; that is triggered 
  when alumina concentrations drop; excess voltages between the anode and alumina 
  bath result in the formation of PFCs (CF<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>) 
  from carbon in the anode and fluorine in the cryolite (Huglen and Kvande, 1994; 
  Cook, 1995; Kimmerle and Potvin, 1997). Several processes for primary aluminium 
  production are in use, with specific emissions ranging from typically 0.15 to 
  1.34 kg CF<sub>4</sub> per tonne Al<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#16","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>16</sup></small></a> 
  depending on type of technology (determined by anode type and alumina feeding 
  technology) (IAI, 2000). Measurements made at smelters with the best available 
  technology (point feed prebake) indicate an emissions rate as low as 0.006 kg 
  CF<sub>4</sub> per tonne Al (Marks <i>et al</i>., 2000). Worldwide average emissions 
  for 1995 are estimated to range from 0.26 to 0.77 kg CF<sub>4</sub> per tonne 
  Al (Harnisch <i>et al</i>., 1998; IEA, 2000). Manufacturers have carried out two surveys 
  on the occurrence of anode effects and associated PFC-emissions (IPAI, 1996; 
  IAI, 2000). Based on 60% coverage of world production (no data on Russia and 
  China) they estimated a mean emission value of 0.3 kg CF<sub>4</sub> per tonne 
  Al in 1997. Emission reductions were achieved from 1990 to 1995 by conversion 
  to newer technologies, retrofitting existing plants, and improved plant operation. 
  Industry-government partnerships also played a significant role in reducing 
  PFC emissions. As of November 1998, 10 countries (which accounted for 50% of 
  global aluminium production in 1998) have undertaken industry-government initiatives 
  to reduce PFC emissions from primary aluminium production (US EPA, 1999d). It 
  has been estimated that emissions could be further reduced via equipment retrofits, 
  such as the addition or improvement of computer control systems (a minor retrofit) 
  and the conversion to point-feed systems (a major retrofit). One study estimated 
  1995 emissions could be reduced an additional 10%&#150;50% (depending on technology 
  type and region) with maximum costs ranging from US$110/tCO<sub>2eq</sub> for 
  a minor retrofit to nearly US$1100/tCO<sub>2eq</sub> for a major retrofit (IEA, 
  2000). A second study estimates that 1995 emissions could be reduced by 40% 
  at costs lower than US$30/tC<sub>eq</sub>, by 65% at costs lower than US$100/tC<sub>eq</sub> 
  and by 85% at costs lower than US$300/tC<sub>eq</sub> (Harnisch <i>et al</i>., 1998; 
  15% discount rate, 10 year amortization). </p>
<p>The development of an inert, non-carbon anode is being pursued through governmental 
  and industrial research and development efforts. A non-carbon anode would remove 
  the source of carbon for PFC generation, thereby eliminating PFC emissions (AA, 
  1998). A commercially viable design is expected by 2020.</p>

<h4>3.5.4.3 PFCs and Other Substances used in Semiconductor Production</h4>
<p>The semiconductor industry uses HFC-23, CF<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, 
  C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, c-C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, SF<sub>6</sub> and NF<sub>3</sub> 
  in two production processes: plasma etching thin films (etch) and plasma cleaning 
  chemical vapour deposition (CVD) tool chambers. These chemicals are critical 
  to current manufacturing methods because they possess unique characteristics 
  when used in a plasma that currently cannot be duplicated by alternatives. The 
  industry&#146;s technical reliance on high GWP chemicals is increasing as a 
  consequence of growing demand for semiconductor devices (15% average annual 
  growth), and ever-increasing complexity of semiconductor devices. </p>
<p>Baseline processes consume from 15%-60% of influent PFCs depending on the chemical 
  used and the process application (etch or CVD). PFC emissions, however, vary 
  depending on a number of factors: gas used, type/brand of equipment used, company-specific 
  process parameters, number of PFC-using steps in a production process, generation 
  of PFC by-product chemicals, and whether abatement equipment has been implemented. 
  Semiconductor product types, manufacturing processes, and, consequently, emissions 
  vary significantly across worldwide semiconductor fabrication facilities.</p>
<p>PFC use by the semiconductor industry began in the early 1990s. Global emissions 
  from semiconductor manufacturing have been estimated at 4 MtC<sub>eq</sub> in 1995 (Harnisch 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998). Options for reducing PFC emissions from semiconductor manufacture 
  include process optimization, alternative chemicals, recovery and/or recycling, 
  and effluent abatement. A number of emission reduction options are now commercially 
  available. For plasma-enhanced CVD chamber cleans, switching to PFCs that are 
  more fully dissociated in the plasma or installing reactive fluorine generators 
  upstream of the chamber is favoured. For etch tools, PFC abatement is currently 
  available (Worth, 2000). However, the size of wafers being processed and the 
  design and age of the fabrication facility have a major impact on the applicability 
  of PFC emission reduction technology. A recent study for the EU (Harnisch and 
  Hendriks, 2000) estimated that 60% of projected emissions from this sector could 
  be abated through the use of NF<sub>3</sub> in chamber cleaning at US$110/tC<sub>eq</sub>. According 
  to the same study another 10% are available through alternative etch chemistry 
  at no costs and about 20% through oxidation of exhausts from etch chambers at 
  US$330/tC<sub>eq</sub>. The remaining emissions from existing systems are assumed to be 
  currently virtually unabatable.</p>
<p>Through the World Semiconductor Council, semiconductor manufacturers in the 
  EU, Japan, Korea, Taiwan (China), and the USA have set a voluntary emission 
  reduction target to lower PFC emissions by at least 10% by 2010 from 1995 (1997 
  for Korea and 1997/1999 average for Taiwan (China) baselines (World Semiconductor 
  Council, 1999). Members of the World Semiconductor Council represent over 90% 
  of global semiconductor manufacture.</p>
