<h4>3.8.4.1.4 Cogeneration</h4>
<p>Combined heat and power (CHP) generation can yield fuel energy utilization 
  rates of up to 90% and can therefore be an effective GHG mitigation option. 
  CHP is possible with all heat machines and fuels (including nuclear, biomass 
  and solar thermal) from a few kW-rated to 1000MW steam-condensing power plants. 
  At the utility level the employment of CHP is closely linked with industrial 
  heat loads as well as the availability or development of district heating and/or 
  cooling networks. These are energy transmission systems suited for the distribution 
  of heat and/or cooling within areas with sufficiently high heat/cooling load 
  densities (Kalkum <i>et al</i>., 1993; Rogner, 1993). The expanded use of natural 
  gas may provide a basis for increased dispersed cogeneration. Industrial CHP 
  utilizes temperature differentials between the heat source and the process temperature 
  requirements for electricity generation. More recently, in some countries electricity 
  market deregulation has made it easier for large industrial users to generate 
  their own electricity as well as heat by being more easily able to sell any 
  surplus electricity (see <a href="138.htm#3851">Section 3.8.5.1</a>). Conversely, 
  following deregulation in Germany and elsewhere, large grid CHP has suffered 
  market loss as a consequence of existing surplus generating capacity and independent 
  generation. There is good potential for cogeneration of biomass including bagasse 
  in developing countries such as India, where the market potential is 3500MW. 
  However, a heat demand is necessary for CHP plants to be implemented successfully.</p>

<h4>3.8.4.1.5 Fuel Cells</h4>
<p>Several types of fuel cell compete for early entry into a variety of prospective 
  markets (Gregory and Rogner, 1998). Proton exchange membrane, phosphoric acid, 
  fuel cells (PAFCs) and solid oxide fuel cells are the current technology options. 
  Each type has its own distinctive characteristics such as operating temperatures, 
  efficiency ranges, fuel use, markets and costs<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#18","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>18</sup></small></a>. 
  The potential advantages of fuel cells over gas turbines include smaller unit 
  sizes at similar efficiencies, the potential of a low or quasi zero GHG emission 
  technology at the point of use, lower maintenance costs, less noise and, eventually, 
  better economic performance.</p>
<p>The internal fuel is hydrogen, but some fuel cell types can use fuels such 
  as CO, methanol, natural gas or even coal if externally converted to hydrogen 
  at the plant via gasification and steam reforming or partial oxidation. Alternatively, 
  some fuel cell designs perform the hydrogen conversion step internally as an 
  integral part of the technology. </p>
<p>Hydrogen production from hydrocarbon fuels generates some airborne emissions 
  (NO<sub>x</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub> and NMVOCs) but these are &#150; with the 
  exception of CO<sub>2</sub> - orders of magnitude lower than those associated 
  with combustion cycles. The electrochemistry of most fuel cells demands the 
  use of sulphur-free natural gas, hence no SO<sub>2</sub> emissions occur. CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions are a function of the electrical efficiency and as such are comparable 
  with the efficient CCGT. Non fossil-derived hydrogen, e.g., by way of solar 
  powered electrolysis or from methanol derived from biomass, can be used with 
  virtually zero GHG emissions. </p>
<p>Proton exchange membrane (PEM) conversion efficiencies are currently at 45%-48%<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#19","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>19</sup></small></a> 
  using hydrogen as the onboard fuel, and are expected to approach 55%-60% in 
  the near term future. The joint venture between the leading PEM fuel cell producer 
  and major automobile manufacturers aimed at mass producing PEMs for vehicle 
  propulsion targets to bring down costs to less than US$500/kW<sub>e</sub> by 
  2000 and to less than US$250/kW<sub>e</sub> by 2010 (Rogner, 1998b). In the 
  very long term, costs comparable to current internal combustion engines of approximately 
  US$50/kW<sub>e</sub> have been suggested (Lovins, 1996).</p>
<p>Phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs) operate at around 200&THORN;C and pressures 
  up to 8 bar. At present, PAFCs, in particular the 200 kW ONSI PC25, are commercially 
  the most advanced fuel cells in the market place and have accumulated more than 
  one million hours of operating experience world-wide. Stationary PAFC applications 
  include the world&#146;s largest fuel cell power plant of 11 MW in Goi, Japan, 
  which was in test operation from 1991 to 1997, commissioned by Tokyo Electric 
  Power Company (TEPCO). Natural gas to electricity conversion was 36 to 38% efficient. 
  Overall fuel effectiveness with waste heat utilization can be as high as 80%. 
  Capital costs for an integrated system, including a fuel processor based on 
  natural gas, are expected to decline to about US$1,500/kW<sub>e</sub> by 2000. 
  Long-term costs will depend on manufacturing volumes, but industry experts project 
  costs below US$700/kW<sub>e</sub> by 2010 (Tauber and Jablonski, 1998) at electrical 
  efficiencies of 50% and overall fuel effectiveness of 90% for cogeneration.</p>
<p>Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) operating at 650&THORN;C open the possibility 
  of using carbonaceous fuels and internal reforming. With steam turbines in a 
  bottoming cycle, the overall electrical efficiency could be as high as 65%. 
  There are still major technical problems associated with MCFCs such as electrode 
  corrosion, the sintering of the structural fuel cell material, and sensitivity 
  to fuel impurities.</p>
<p>The operating temperature of 1000&THORN;C of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) 
  allows internal reforming and produces high quality by-product heat for cogeneration 
  or for use in a bottoming cycle. The development of suitable materials and the 
  fabrication of ceramic structures are presently the key technical challenges 
  facing SOFCs. They are currently being demonstrated in a 100-kilowatt plant 
  and are expected to be competitive with traditional fossil-fired generation 
  early in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Installation costs will eventually reach 
  about US$700/kW<sub>e</sub> (EPRI, 1997) though other sources report US$1,620/kW<sub>e</sub> 
  for the period 2005-2010 (OECD, 1998b). </p>
<p>Hybrid SOFC/CCGT systems have projected efficiencies of 72 to 74%, and, depending 
  on R&amp;D progress, would represent the ultimate fossil fuel based electricity 
  generation (Federal Energy Technology Center, 1997). Typical plant sizes would 
  be 1 to 100 MW and, fuelled with natural gas, would produce the lowest emissions 
  of all fossil fuel electricity generating options of about 75&#150;80gC/kWh.<br>
