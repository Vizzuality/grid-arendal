<h2><a name="45"></a>4.5 Social and Economic Considerations</h2>
<h3><a name="451"></a>4.5.1 Economics</h3>
<p>The method of calculating costs for forestry and agricultural projects differs. 
  Forestry almost always looks at private market costs. However, many, if not 
  most, forestry projects have positive externalities (or ancillary benefits) 
  in the form of erosion control, water protection, flora and fauna habitat, non-timber 
  forest products, water protection, and so forth (Makundi, 1997; Frumhoff <i>et al</i>., 1998; Trexler and Associates, 1998). For agricultural projects the approach 
  is typically tied to the idea that the carbon-sequestering projects are essentially 
  productivity enhancing and therefore can be viewed as &#147;no regrets&#148; 
  activities; these are actions that have benefits in themselves aside from climate 
  mitigation, which make the project socially desirable even without its carbon 
  benefits. Such &#147;no regrets&#148; activities generally take the form of 
  soil management activities, which both generate increased sequestered carbon 
  and improve agricultural productivity. </p>
<p>There are basically three different ways of estimating the costs of sequestration 
  of forestry projects &#150; point estimates, i.e., cost for a particular level 
  of output; partial equilibrium estimates, e.g., a cost function construction 
  with the prices of inputs being held constant; and more general equilibrium 
  types of approaches, e.g., a market equilibrium model in which some other prices, 
  such as the prices of land inputs and the relative price of all other goods, 
  are allowed to change owing to market forces. Additionally, economic models 
  can incorporate changing climate conditions to estimate changes in economic 
  variables as the climate and ecosystem change. Early studies tended to look 
  at individual projects, relating the private costs of establishing a project 
  to the cumulative carbon sequestered over the life of the project (see Sedjo 
  <i>et al</i>., 1995). Many of the point estimate type studies provide undiscounted 
  private market cost point estimates of the carbon sequestration in afforestation 
  projects. However, this approach usually reveals little about how costs might 
  change if the project were expanded to involve truly large land areas, as they 
  do not recognize rising costs required to increasingly bid land away from alternative 
  uses. These types of estimates tended to be biased downwards, partly because 
  the opportunity costs of the land (land rents) were often ignored. </p>
<p><i>Point Estimates</i>: The cost estimates of actually sequestering carbon 
  obtained in point estimate type of studies tend to be quite low; in the SAR 
  (IPCC, 1996) a range was given of US$3-US$7 per tonne of carbon. Additionally, 
  a large number of more recent point estimate country studies reported most unit 
  abatement costs in this low range, or lower. The earlier IPCC estimates for 
  SAR were that of an investment of US$ 168-220 billion required to mitigate 45-72GtC 
  in the tropical regions. More recent work provides estimates that the cumulative 
  investment required for mitigating 26.53GtC to be US$63.6 billion at an overall 
  cost of US$2.4/tC (Sathaye and Ravindranath, 1998). The unit cost given in <a href="164.htm#tab43">Table 
  4.3</a> shows that the investment cost of mitigation is generally quite low 
  for carbon conservation options in selected developing countries and South Korea 
  (e.g., US$0.10/tC in Vietnam, and US$1- 2/tC in Cameroon and Ghana). The mitigation 
  cost is lower than US$2/tC for the majority of the options in Indonesia, the 
  Philippines, Vietnam, and Mongolia.</p>
<p><i>Partial Equilibrium</i>: Partial equilibrium involves a more complete estimation 
  of a static cost function that estimates rising costs (e.g., as a result of 
  land price increases as one moves to lands with higher opportunity costs) associated 
  with increased sequestration activities. These studies generate marginal cost 
  functions that tend to suggest most costs are higher than those of the simple 
  point estimates. This is because, for example, they include in the cost estimates 
  the opportunity costs of the land, and they recognize rising costs associated 
  with additional planning activity and, for some, because they apply a discount 
  rate to future physical carbon sequestered. The costs for modest amounts of 
  carbon sequestered in specific areas are generally in the US$20-US$100/tC range 
  (Moulton and Richards, 1990; Adams <i>et al</i>., 1995; Parks and Hardie, 1997;Stavins, 
  1999; Plantinga <i>et al</i>., 1999). Costs tend to depend on the forest growth 
  rates anticipated and the opportunity costs of the land. Where projects are 
  small, land prices would be expected to be stable. However, in regions where 
  projects are large, land prices, and hence sequestration costs, will tend to 
  rise. <br>

      <p><b>Figure 4.9:</b> Indicative curves of costs (US$/tC, cost of US$28/tC 
        is equivalent to US$100 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>) of emission reduction 
        or carbon sequestration by level of total reduction. The curves display 
        how comparable options vary in costs between world regions. However, costs 
        per option are also reported to vary widely at comparable total levels 
        of reduction. This is mainly because cost studies have not been carried 
        out in the same way. In some options net monetary profit may occur as 
        well (i.e., costs may be negative as well) (Brown <i>et al</i>., 1996a, Hol <i>et al</i>., 1999; Jepma <i>et al</i>., 1997; Sedjo <i>et al</i>., 1995). </p>

<p><a name="fig49"></a><i>Market Equilibrium Models</i>: This approach incorporates 
  sectoral and general equilibrium interrelationships. It recognizes that expanding 
  the forest for carbon sequestration purposes has implications for current and 
  future industrial forest production and prices, and for agricultural production 
  and prices. These price and production changes then generate feedbacks through 
  the market to the forest and agricultural sector behaviour. Alig <i>et al</i>. 
  (1997), for example, examine the effects on welfare costs of meeting alternative 
  carbon sequestration targets by land re-allocations between agriculture and 
  forestry in the USA. This model explicitly treats agriculture and wood production 
  as interrelated. Allocating more land to trees to capture carbon has implications 
  on the price and quantity of agricultural products, as well as on timber. Thus, 
  the costs of carbon plantations are found both in the price of establishing 
  the plantations and in the higher agricultural prices, and thus involve welfare 
  shifts across sectors. A different approach, also recognizing sectoral interrelationships, 
  is that of Sedjo and Sohngen (2000). This approach expands on earlier global 
  timber supply models by explicitly incorporating the interrelations between 
  the industrial wood sector and carbon plantations by recognizing the joint product 
  nature of industrial wood and carbon. This approach finds that tree planting 
  carbon sequestration activities tend to have a somewhat more modest effect than 
  anticipated, since the tree planting for carbon purposes leads to an expected 
  increase in future timber supplies and a corresponding decrease in expected 
  future prices. Through the effects of price expectations on the timber market, 
  carbon activities may discourage industrial timber investments and thereby lose 
  some of the carbon gains made from the initial project. This is a form of leakage 
  not often recognized.</p>
<p><i>Climate Feedback Models</i>: These market equilibrium models incorporate 
  the impact of the climate-driven changing ecology into their assessment of the 
  potential and costs. Perez-Garcia <i>et al</i>. (1997) examine the effects of 
  climate change, using a global trade model (CGTM). This approach imposes a global 
  circulation model (GCM) and a terrestrial ecosystem model on the world&#146;s 
  industrial wood economy, and estimates the welfare effects on forest owners 
  and forest consumers of such changes. Sohngen and Mendelsohn (1998) use a timber 
  model of the USA to estimate the changes in the forest market sector that would 
  be expected to occur with a climate warming using GCM and terrestrial ecosystem 
  models. However, neither study considers the impacts of increased fuelwood demand 
  to replace fossil fuels. </p>
<p>In summary, most studies, of all methodologies, suggest that there are many 
  opportunities for relatively low-cost carbon sequestration through forestry. 
  Estimates of the private costs of sequestration range from about US$0.10-US$100/tC, 
  which are modest compared with many of the energy alternatives (see <a href="101.htm#tab39">Table 
  3.9</a> and <a href="171.htm#fig49">Figure 4.9</a>). Additionally, it should 
  be noted that most forest projects have positive non-market benefits, thus increasing 
  their social worth. However, as the studies have become more sophisticated, 
  incorporating both the full private opportunity costs of the land and market 
  effects on land and resource prices, estimates of carbon sequestration costs 
  have tended to rise. The cost estimates tend to vary for regions, with high 
  costs generally associated with high opportunity costs for land. In the many 
  regions that have low opportunity costs for land, including many subtropical 
  regions, the costs tend to remain low.</p>
