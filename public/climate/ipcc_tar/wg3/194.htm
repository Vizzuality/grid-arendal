<h3>5.3.6 Institutional Frameworks </h3>
<p>Economic actors interact and organize themselves to generate growth and development 
  through institutions (and policy making). While organizations are material entities 
  possessing offices, personnel, equipment, budgets, and a legal character; institutions 
  are systems of rules, decision-making procedures, and programmes that give rise 
  to social practices, assign roles to participants in these practices, and guide 
  their interactions. Organizations may administer institutions (Young, 1994). 
  Institutions exhibit substantial continuity and offer narrow and infrequent 
  windows of opportunity for reform (Aghion and Howitt, 1998; Rip <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
  Institutions operate in larger settings characterized by material conditions 
  such as the nature of available technologies and the distribution of wealth, 
  by cognitive conditions such as prevailing values, norms, and beliefs, and by 
  transaction costs, costs of co-ordination, laws, etc. (Young, 1994; Coase, 1998). 
  The market is a &#147;set of institutions, expectations, and patterns of behaviour 
  that enable voluntary exchanges&#148; based on the willingness to pay of the 
  parties to the exchange (Haddad, 2000). One major concern of the new institutional 
  economics is the boundary between the market on which transactions are negotiated 
  and organizations such as the firm (Simon, 1991).</p>
<p>On one level, all barriers can be considered institutional in origin, because 
  markets, firms, governments, etc. are all institutions. In this section, however, 
  the focus is on those barriers that derive from widespread or generic attributes 
  of institutions. The distinctions are necessarily arbitrary, and some overlap 
  between the discussion in this and other subsections is inevitable.</p>
<p>Institutions are a form of capital, social capital (Coleman, 1988). Social 
  capital, like natural and human capital, is at the same time an input and an 
  amenity. As an input, it enhances the benefits of investments in other factors 
  and, thereby, shares the &#147;shift&#148; feature of technology (World Bank, 
  1997). Social capital is a public good and suffers, therefore, from underinvestment. 
  Generally, weaknesses in social capital resulting from prevailing beliefs, norms, 
  and values are an important generic barrier to the effectiveness of institutions. 
  At the microeconomic level, social capital may be viewed as a social network, 
  and as associated norms which may improve the functioning of markets and the 
  productivity of the community for the benefit of the members of the association 
  (Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 1993; World Bank, 1997; Young, 1999). At the macroeconomic 
  level, social capital includes the political regime, the legal frameworks, and 
  the government&#146;s role in the organization of production in order to improve 
  macroeconomic performance as well as market efficiency (Olson, 1982; North, 
  1990). Institutions may remedy market failures due to asymmetric information 
  through information sharing (Shah, 1991). Societies in which trust and civic 
  co-operation are strong, a component of social capital, have significant positive 
  impact on productivity and provide stronger incentives to innovate and to accumulate 
  physical capital. Trust and civic co-operation tend to affect human capital 
  productivity especially (Knack and Keefer, 1997). </p>
