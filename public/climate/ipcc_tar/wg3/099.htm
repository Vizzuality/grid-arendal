<p>Since the publication of the SAR, important advances have been achieved in 
  several areas of automotive technology. Among the most significant are: (1) 
  two global automotive manufacturers are now selling hybrid automobiles 5-10 
  years ahead of what was anticipated just 5 years ago; (2) dramatic reductions 
  have been made in fuel cell cost and size, such that several manufacturers have 
  announced that they will introduce fuel cell vehicles by 2005, 10-20 years ahead 
  of what was previously anticipated; and (3) improvements in fuels, engine controls, 
  and emissions after-treatment led to the production of a gasoline internal combustion 
  engine vehicle with virtually zero emissions of urban air pollutants. This achievement, 
  combined with regulations requiring low-sulphur fuels, may foreshadow the development 
  of acceptable emissions control systems for more energy efficient direct injection 
  engines, although significant hurdles remain. It may also reduce the incentive 
  for adopting alternative fuel vehicles, such as battery electric and natural 
  gas vehicles, which can also have lower greenhouse gas emissions. These developments 
  could have profound effects on future GHG emissions from road, rail, marine, 
  and pipeline transport. Also, since the publication of the SAR, the IPCC has 
  released a comprehensive report on the impacts of aviation on the global atmosphere 
  (Penner <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1999) that includes a projection of expected progress in reducing 
  energy intensity and GHG emissions from commercial air transport, and adds greatly 
  to the information about aviation&#146;s effects on climate.</p>
<p>Worldwide, transport produces roughly 20% of carbon emissions and smaller shares 
  of the other five greenhouse gasses covered under the Kyoto Protocol. According 
  to IEA statistics, the transport sector&#146;s share of world GHG emissions 
  increased from about 19% in 1971 to 22% in 1995 (Price <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1998) and 23% 
  in 1997 (IEA, 1999c, p. II.67). Excluding emissions from vehicle air conditioners 
  (described in the <a href="142.htm">Appendix</a>), CO<sub>2</sub> from combustion of fossil fuels is the predominant 
  GHG produced by transport, accounting for over 95% of the annual global warming 
  potential produced by the sector. Nitrous oxide produced by vehicles equipped 
  with catalytic converters, and methane emitted by internal combustion engines 
  account for nearly all the remainder. Almost all of the carbon comes from petroleum 
  fuels. Between 1973 and 1996, world transportation energy use, of which petroleum-derived 
  fuels comprise over 95%, increased by 66% (<a href="#fig35">Figure 3.5</a>). Alternative energy sources 
  have not played a significant role in the world&#146;s transport systems. Despite 
  two decades of price upheavals in world oil markets, considerable research and 
  development of alternative fuel technologies, and notable attempts to promote 
  alternative fuels through tax subsidies and other policies, petroleum&#146;s 
  share of transport energy use has not decreased (94.7% in 1973 and 96.0% in 
  1996) according to IEA statistics (IEA, 1999c).</p>
<p>On a modal basis, road transport accounts for almost 80% of transport energy 
  use (<a href="#fig36">Figure 3.6</a>). Light-duty vehicles alone comprise about 50%. Air transport 
  is the second largest, and most rapidly growing mode, with about 12% of current 
  transport energy use according to International Energy Agency estimates (IEA, 
  1999c).</p>
<p>The growth of transport energy use, its continued reliance on petroleum and 
  the consequent increases in carbon emissions are driven by the long-term trends 
  of increasing motorization of world transport systems and ever-growing demand 
  for mobility. Immediately after World War II, the world&#146;s motor vehicle 
  fleet numbered 46 million vehicles, and 75% of the world&#146;s cars and trucks 
  were in the USA. In 1996, there were 671 million highway vehicles worldwide, 
  and the US share stood at just over 30% (<a href="#fig37">Figure 3.7</a>). Since 1970, the US motor 
  vehicle population has been growing at an average rate of 2.5% per year, but 
  the population of vehicles in the rest of the world has been increasing almost 
  twice as rapidly at 4.8% per year (AAMA, 1998, p. 8). The same patterns of growth 
  are discernible in statistics on vehicle stocks (ECMT, 1998).</p>
<p>Transport achieved major energy efficiency gains in the 1970s and 1980s, partly 
  because of an economic response to the oil price increases of 1973 to 1974 and 
  1979 to 1980, and partly as a result of government policies inspired by the 
  oil price shocks. Driven principally by mandatory standards, the average fuel 
  economy of new passenger cars doubled in the USA between 1974 and 1984 (e.g., 
  Greene, 1998). In Europe, similar improvements were achieved by a combination 
  of voluntary efficiency agreements and higher taxes on motor fuels. From 1980 
  to 1995 the average sales-weighted fuel consumption rates of passenger cars 
  sold in Europe and Japan fell by 12%, from 8.3 l/100km to 7.3 l/100km (Perkins, 
  1998). All of the decrease, however, occurred between 1980 and 1985 (<a href="#fig38">Figure 
  3.8</a>). Since 1985, the fuel economies of light-duty vehicles sold in the USA 
  and Europe have remained essentially constant.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency improvements in other modes have also slowed or stagnated 
  over the past 10-15 years. Average energy use per passenger-kilometre in Europe 
  and Japan actually increased between 1973 and 1993/4, but declined by almost 
  20% in the USA (<a href="#tab36">Table 3.6</a>). Bus and rail modal energy intensities generally 
  increased, with the exception of rail travel in Europe. The energy intensity 
  of commercial air travel, however, has declined consistently, achieving a 40%-50% 
  reduction over the last 25 years. </p>
<p>On the freight side, trucking&#146;s share of tonne km increased in every OECD 
  country, included in a recent analysis of energy trends by the IEA (1997d, <a href="163.htm#fig46">Figure 
  4.6</a>), leading to an overall increase in the energy intensity (MJ/t-km) of freight 
  movements. Unlike passenger modes, for freight, changes in modal structure tend 
  to dominate changes in modal energy intensities in determining overall energy 
  intensity (IEA, 1997d, p. 127).</p>
<p>The slowing of energy efficiency improvements in recent years has occurred 
  despite the fact that new technologies with the potential to increase energy 
  efficiency continue to be adopted. In Europe, the market share of diesel cars 
  increased from 7% in 1980 to 17% in 1985 and 23% in 1995, due in part to lower 
  diesel fuel taxes (Perkins, 1998). In the USA, emissions and fuel economy standards 
  increased the use of multipoint fuel injection from 16% of new light-duty vehicles 
  in 1985 to 100% in 1999, and installation of 4- and 5-valve engines increased 
  from zero to 40% over the same period (Heavenrich and Hellman, 1999, Table 4). 
  Manufacturers also continued to substitute lighter weight materials such as 
  high-strength steel and aluminium, and to reduce aerodynamic drag and tyre rolling 
  resistance. Yet fuel economy stagnated because vehicles were made larger and 
  much more powerful. Between 1988 and 1999, the average mass of a new US light-duty 
  vehicle increased from 1381 kg to 1534 kg. At the same time, power per kg increased 
  29% (Heavenrich and Hellman, 1999). In Europe, the average power per car increased 
  by 27% between 1980 and 1995, from 51 to 65 kW (Perkins, 1998).</p>

<p>Because of the slowing down of energy efficiency gains, world transportation 
  energy use is now increasing at just slightly less than the rate of growth in 
  transportation activity. Given the relatively close correlation between economic 
  growth and the demand for transport (<a href="#tab37">Table 3.7</a>; see WEC, 1995b, Ch. 3.2 for 
  further details), it is reasonable to expect continued strong growth of transport 
  energy use and carbon emissions, unless significant, new policy initiatives 
  are undertaken. The following paragraphs review several studies of future transportation 
  demand and energy use. A common theme of these and many others is strong growth 
  in transport energy use and the challenges it poses to reducing greenhouse gas 
  emissions from the sector.</p>

<p>Projections of future transport energy use under baseline assumptions reflect 
  an expectation of robust growth in transport activity, energy demand, and carbon 
  emissions through 2020. The World Energy Council (WEC, 1995b) considered three 
  alternative scenarios for transport energy demand through 2020: (1) &#147;markets 
  rule&#148;, (2) &#147;muddling through&#148;, and (3) &#147;green drivers&#148;. 
  Of these, markets rule reflects a high-growth baseline future (2.8%/yr in the 
  OECD, 5.2% in the rest of the world), muddling through a lower growth one (2.2%/year 
  in OECD, 4.2% elsewhere). In the markets rule scenario, world transport energy 
  consumption grows 200% in the quarter century from 1995 to 2020. In the muddling 
  through scenario, transport energy use grows by 100% by 2020, with most of the 
  shortfall from the markets rule scenario occurring after 2010. In the green 
  drivers scenario, transport energy use is nearly constant as a result of much 
  higher energy taxes and comprehensive environmental regulation. In all three 
  scenarios, growth in freight transport and air travel far outpace the growth 
  of passenger vehicle travel, so that the passenger car&#146;s share of total 
  transport energy use falls from about 50% in 1995 to 30% by 2020.</p>
<p>A more recent WEC (1998a) report foresaw considerably slower growth in transport 
  energy use through 2020: 55% in a base case with an 85% increase in a higher 
  economic growth case. In both cases, light-duty vehicles continued to dominate 
  through 2020, accounting for 44% of global transport energy demand in the base 
  case. Still road freight and air travel gained on highway passenger vehicles. 
  Road freight increased from 30% of transport energy demand in 1995 to 33% in 
  2020. Air transport&#146;s share grew from 8% to almost 13%. Global carbon emissions 
  from transport were expected to grow by 56% in the base case, from 1.6GtC in 
  1995 to 2.5GtC in 2020. </p>
<p>The US DOE and US Energy Information Administration&#146;s (EIA&#146;s) International 
  Energy Outlook (1999b, p.115) foresees transportation&#146;s share of world 
  oil consumption climbing from 48% in 1996 to 53% by 2010 and 56% by 2020. The 
  EIA expects a 77% increase in total world transport energy use by 2020, an average 
  annual global growth rate of 2.4% (<a href="#tab38">Table 3.8</a>). Road dominance 
  of energy use is maintained by the rapid increase in vehicle stocks outside 
  of the OECD. The world motor vehicle population is projected to surpass 1.1 
  billion vehicles in 2020. The SAR (Michaelis <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1996, Table 21-3) presented 
  projections of future global vehicle stocks ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 billion 
  by 2030, rising to 1.6 to 5.0 billion by 2100.</p>

<p>Projections of passenger travel, energy use, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to 2050 by Schafer 
  and Victor (1999) show carbon emissions rising from 0.8GtC in 1990 to 2.7GtC 
  in 2050, driven by an increase in travel demand from 23 trillion passenger-kilometres 
  in 1990 to 105 trillion p-km in 2050. The model used is based on constant travel 
  budgets for time and money, so that as incomes and travel demand grow, passenger 
  travel must shift to faster modes in order to stay within time budget limits. 
  As a result, automobile travel first increases, and then eventually declines 
  as travel shifts to high-speed rail and air. The projections assume that car, 
  bus and conventional rail systems maintain their energy intensities at approximately 
  1990 levels through 2050. Energy intensity of the air mode (which by the authors&#146; 
  definition includes high-speed rail) is assumed to decrease by 70% by 2050, 
  substantially more than the Penner <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1999)-report estimates. No change 
  in the average carbon content of transportation fuels is assumed. </p>
<p>Projections such as these suggest that it will be very difficult to attain 
  a goal such as holding transport&#146;s carbon emissions below 1990 levels by 
  2010. Lead times for introducing significant new technologies, combined with 
  the normal lifetimes for transportation equipment on the order of 15 years, 
  imply that sudden, massive changes in the trends and outlooks described above 
  can be achieved only with determined effort. At the same time, dramatic advances 
  in transport energy technology have been achieved over just the past 5 years, 
  and the potential for further advances is very promising. By 2020 and beyond 
  the world may see revolutionary changes in energy sources and power plants for 
  new transport equipment, provided that appropriate policies are implemented 
  to accelerate and direct technological changes towards global environmental 
  goals.</p>
