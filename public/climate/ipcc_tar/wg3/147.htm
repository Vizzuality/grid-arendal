<h3>A3.2.2 Domestic Appliances</h3>
<p>In developed countries, the only replacements for the fluid CFC-12 in refrigerators 
  and freezers have been HFC-134a and isobutane (R-600a). Developing countries 
  have chosen the same replacements, but some still utilize CFC-12; here, the 
  complete conversion of new equipment from CFC-12 is not expected until 2001-2002. 
  Globally, in 1996 to isobutane was used in about 8% of new appliances (UNEP, 
  1998a). Isobutane accounts for a much higher and growing percentage in Northern 
  European countries such as Germany, where it is used in virtually all new domestic 
  appliances. It is estimated that isobutane currently is the coolant used in 
  45%-50% of domestic refrigerator and freezer sold in Western Europe. Projected 
  use and emissions of HFC-134a are shown in <a href="145.htm#taba32">Table A3.2</a>.</p>
<p>HFC emission reductions achieved during servicing and through recovery of the 
  refrigerant upon disposal of appliances are costly. Next to economic incentives, 
  regulations (as already exist for CFC-containing appliances in several countries) 
  would probably be required to obtain significant emissions reductions through 
  HFC recovery (March, 1998). One study (Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000) reports 
  a value of US$334/tCeq for the recovery of HFCs from refrigerators; the larger 
  part of this is the cost for the transport and collection scheme.</p>
<p>Product liability, export market opportunities, and regulatory differences 
  among regions are likely to be significant factors in determining the choice 
  between isobutane and HFC-134a systems. Isobutane may well account for over 
  20% of domestic appliances globally by the year 2010. Published estimates suggest 
  that isobutane systems are US$15 to US$35 more expensive than HFC-134a systems 
  (Juergensen, 1995; Dieckmann et al., 1999). These costs would translate into 
  a cost effectiveness of US$600/tCeq due to the relatively small refrigerant 
  charge (about 120 g of HFC-134a).</p>

<h3>A3.2.3 Commercial Refrigeration</h3>
<p>The primary refrigerants used in this sector are R-404A and HFC-134a; usage 
  of R-407C and R-507 is relatively small. Hydrocarbons are being applied in smaller 
  direct expansion systems and in both small and large systems with a secondary 
  loop, whereas ammonia is mainly applied in larger systems with secondary loops 
  (UNEP, 1998a). Projected consumption and emissions of HFCs are shown in <a href="145.htm#taba32">Table 
  A3.2</a>.</p>
<p>Historical emission rates of CFC refrigerants from the commercial refrigeration 
  sector were 30% or more of the system charge per year. Regulations have resulted 
  in improved system designs and service practices with significantly lower emissions 
  in many countries (UNEP, 1998a; IEA, 1998). These practices are being carried 
  over to HFC systems and the emissions savings are reflected in the projections 
  shown in <a href="145.htm#taba32">Table A3.2</a> (UNEP, 1999b). March (1998) 
  estimated that refrigerant emissions could be further reduced through better 
  containment and recovery by an additional 30% to 50% in 2010 for Europe. In 
  many developing countries, the supermarket refrigeration units are often produced 
  by small and medium enterprises to lower quality standards, leading to considerable 
  emissions of HFCs. The existing stock of supermarket refrigerators continues 
  to operate with CFC-12 and HCFC-22.</p>
<p>The use of hydrocarbons and ammonia as refrigerants in this sector is growing 
  from a small base. Several large commercial refrigeration manufacturers are 
  developing systems using carbon dioxide which are expected to enter the market 
  shortly. The HFC projections shown in <a href="145.htm#taba32">Table A3.2</a> 
  are based upon the assumption that less than 10% of the systems will use ammonia, 
  hydrocarbons, and carbon dioxide in 2010.</p>

<h3>A3.2.4 Residential and Commercial Air Conditioning and Heating</h3>
<p>Most existing residential air conditioning and heating systems (unitary systems) 
  currently use HCFC-22 as the refrigerant; in the manufacturing of new systems 
  HCFC-22 is being displaced by HFC blends, and to a lesser extent, by propane 
  in some systems. In developed countries, the Montreal Protocol and more stringent 
  national regulations are leading to a replacement of HCFC-22 in virtually all 
  new equipment, ultimately by 2010. The leading HFC alternatives are R-407C and 
  R-410A (UNEP, 1998a), the latter particularly for smaller units in the developed 
  countries at present. In developing countries, HCFC-22 will be available for 
  many more years and the use of HFC blends may remain small. Split HC based air 
  conditioning equipment is produced by some smaller European manufacturers; production 
  of these units is being announced by others. Estimated consumption and emission 
  amounts for 2010 are shown in <a href="145.htm#taba32">Table A3.2</a>.</p>
<p>In small water chillers, applying a variety of compressor types, there is emphasis 
  on the use of R-407C. For large water chillers that apply centrifugal compressors, 
  the primary alternatives to CFCs are HFC-134a and HCFC-123. HCFC-123 is used 
  in virtually all low-pressure chillers since it has a very high energy-efficiency 
  and so far no highly efficient, low-pressure non-ODS alternative has become 
  available (Wuebbles and Calm, 1997). Certain existing high-pressure HFC equipment 
  or new low pressure HFCs may take over the low-pressure market gradually in 
  the near future (IEA, 1998). Ammonia chillers form an important replacement 
  and they are already in use in some regions. In large chillers, there is some 
  use of water as a refrigerant, particularly in Northern Europe, where the water 
  can also be used &#150; in ice slurry form &#150; as the cooling agent in the 
  secondary loop. Use of hydrocarbon refrigerants for chillers is growing from 
  a small base. Estimated consumption and emissions of HFCs are shown in <a href="145.htm#taba32">Table 
  A3.2</a>.</p>
<p>Continued improvement in emissions reductions is anticipated. In 1994, the 
  annual emission rates from low-pressure CFC chillers were estimated at 7% and 
  for high pressure CFC-12 chillers at 17% (UNEP 1998a); for current new low (HCFC-123) 
  and high pressure chillers the emissions are estimated at less than 2% and 8%, 
  respectively.</p>
