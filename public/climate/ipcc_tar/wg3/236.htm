<h4>6.2.2.2.1 Collection Point and Tax Base </h4>
<p>Since GHG emissions caused by the combustion of fossil fuels are closely related 
  to the carbon content of the respective fuels, a tax on these emissions can 
  be levied by taxing the carbon content of fossil fuels at any point in the product 
  cycle of the fuel (EIA, 1998).<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#31","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>31</a>, 
  <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#32","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>32</a>, 
  <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#33","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>33</a></sup></small> 
  A producer&#150;importer tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels, coupled 
  with a crediting scheme for exports and non-combustion end-uses, closely replicates 
  the effect of a direct emissions tax on end-users (CCAP, 1998). Further, by 
  focusing on producers and importers rather than end-users, the number of regulated 
  entities is dramatically reduced. Fewer regulated entities lead to substantially 
  lower monitoring and enforcement costs. Modelling studies show that taxing fossil 
  fuels on a basis other than carbon content&#150;for example, energy content 
  or value&#150;also reduces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but usually at a higher 
  cost for a given emissions reduction target (IPCC, 1996, Section 11.5.1).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#34","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>34</sup></small></a></p>
<h4><a name="62222"></a>6.2.2.2.2 Association with Trade, Employment, Revenue, 
  and Research and Development Policies</h4>
<p>In an open economy, countries are often concerned about the impact of emissions 
  taxes on tradable goods sectors (OECD, 1996a; IPCC, 1996, Section 11.6.4). In 
  practice, therefore, current carbon taxes generally tend to have a lower rate 
  on the tradable goods sectors, especially when they are energy intensive. When 
  some trading partners do not undertake emissions reductions, for example, domestic 
  emissions taxes on carbon-intensive tradable goods might simply shift production 
  to countries without such taxes. One solution is corrective taxes on imports 
  and exports (OECD, 1997d). If this option is not available (see <a href="257.htm">Section 
  6.4.2</a>), an emissions tax that is differentiated among various sectors in 
  the economy may be preferred (Hoel, 1996). Another solution, which B&ouml;hringer 
  and Rutherford (1997) find to be more efficient, is sector-specific wage subsidies 
  to protect jobs in the carbon-intensive tradable goods sector.</p>
<p>Opposition to increased environmental regulation in general often centres on 
  concerns that firms might relocate and/or people might lose their jobs (Rosewicz, 
  1990).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#35","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>35</sup></small></a> 
  Emissions taxes are particularly vulnerable to this criticism since they require 
  firms not only to pay abatement costs, but also taxes on their unabated emissions 
  (Vollebergh <i>et al</i>., 1997). Several recent papers, however, argue that emissions 
  taxes are more cost-effective than direct regulation and may even lead to higher 
  employment (Wellisch, 1995; Hoel, 1998). The intuition is that the right to 
  emit pollution constitutes a rent. With mobile capital markets, part of that 
  rent accrues (inefficiently) to owners of capital unless it is taxed (Schneider, 
  1998). By using the tax revenue to offset labour taxes, employment can be higher 
  than in similarly designed policies using direct (technology) regulation (Hoel, 
  1998; see also <a href="260.htm#651">Section 6.5.1</a>). <a href="319.htm">Chapters 
  8</a> and <a href="353.htm">9</a> refer to various sources corroborating 
  the evidence that using emissions and/or energy taxes to reduce distortionary 
  labour taxes tends to increase employment.</p>
<p>Even with an efficient outcome, the immediate profit losses to firms under 
  an emissions tax might be considered &#147;unfair&#148; to firms in carbon-intensive 
  industries. In that case, a portion of the tax revenue can be returned to firms 
  (lump sum) to compensate them for lost profit without a loss of efficiency. 
  Bovenberg and Goulder (1999) estimate that only 15% of the revenue from an emissions 
  tax would need to be refunded to industry to maintain existing profit.</p>
<p>In addition to reducing emissions and raising revenue, a carbon tax also influences 
  innovation. This occurs alongside any distinct R&amp;D policies that are undertaken 
  (see also <a href="242.htm">Section 6.2.2.6</a>). Early work in this area indicated 
  that auctioned permits would provide the largest incentive to innovate, followed 
  by emissions taxes and then permits allocated free (Milliman and Prince, 1989). 
  More recent work demonstrates that with a large number of competitive firms 
  and imperfect R&amp;D markets, taxes may induce more innovation than auctioned 
  permits, although the welfare effects remain ambiguous (Fischer <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
  The incentive for innovation is therefore a necessary design consideration (Grubb 
  <i>et al</i>., 1995; see <a href="242.htm">Section 6.2.2.6</a>). It has been suggested 
  in this regard that the targetted recycling of emissions taxes that support 
  renewable energy and energy efficiency activities may offer specific benefits 
  (see <a href="242.htm">Sections 6.2.2.6</a>, <a href="260.htm#651">6.5.1</a>, 
  <a href="260.htm#652">6.5.2</a>; IPCC, 1996). </p>
<p>In practice, both energy and carbon taxes have already been adopted as responses 
  to commitments under the UNFCCC. The European Commission (EC), for instance, 
  has issued several tax proposals designed to reduce emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  from fossil fuel use. For example, Finland, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and 
  Norway all have energy taxes based in part on carbon content (Speck, 1999; see 
  <a href="227.htm">Section 6.1.3</a>). Other countries that have recently introduced 
  carbon or energy taxes to help achieve their climate change commitments include 
  Slovenia, UK, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland. France is also considering increasing 
  energy taxes on industry for the same purpose. None of these countries have 
  been able to introduce a uniform carbon tax for all fuels in all sectors, because 
  unilateral nature policies raise. In most cases for which an energy or carbon 
  tax is implemented, the tax is implemented in combination with various forms 
  of exemptions (e.g., rebates, VAs).</p>
