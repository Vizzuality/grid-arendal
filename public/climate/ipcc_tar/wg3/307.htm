<h3>7.5.5 Addressing the Specific Characteristics of Markets and Other Exchange 
  Processes in Developing Countries </h3>
<p>Climate change studies focus on the cost assessment of activities through their 
  presentation on the markets. The GHG emission sources considered, on this basis, 
  are predominantly those represented in official economic and sectoral statistics, 
  and the prices used to value the resources are derived on a market basis. Such 
  information, however, is incomplete for developing countries for which markets 
  are incomplete, property rights are not well established, and a significant 
  part of the exchange process belongs to the informal economic sector. This section 
  discusses the implications of these specific features for climate change studies.</p>
<p>GHG emissions in the energy and agriculture sectors are greatly influenced 
  by present subsidies. Subsidy removal in the energy sector, if supported by 
  improvements in managerial efficiency, could reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  and other pollutants by up to 40% in developing countries with very low or even 
  negative costs (Anderson, 1994; Halsn&aelig;s, 1996). It should be recognized 
  that general macroeconomic policies, such as structural adjustment programmes, 
  already include a number of subsidy removal policies. </p>
<p>Most major markets in developing countries are characterized by supply constraints, 
  but the labour market is an exception for unskilled labour is frequently in 
  excess supply. Examples of such supply constraints are seen in the financial 
  sector, power production, and infrastructure development. This results from 
  high transaction costs that originate from weak market linkages, limited information, 
  inadequate institutional set-ups, and policy distortions. Such market imperfections 
  make it difficult to establish reliable parameters such as price elasticity 
  of demand. </p>
<p>In many developing countries and EITs, commodity prices, including those of 
  energy resources, are regulated and are not market determined. The consequent 
  market distortions are often not adequately captured by models. There is therefore 
  a need to apply some price-correcting rules to reflect social costs.</p>
<p>Traditional cost&#150;benefit analysis suggests the use of shadow prices to 
  correct for market distortions (see <a href="277.htm#7231">Section 7.2.3.1</a>). 
  Such a procedure is in line with the approach of CGE models. In both these approaches 
  mitigation policies and related costs are assessed in relation to an &#147;optimal 
  resource allocation case&#148;, in which markets are in equilibrium and prices 
  (and thereby cost) reflect resource scarcities. However, these conditions are 
  far from those currently found in these countries, so studies should consider 
  how a transformation to the optimal resource allocation case is likely to take 
  place over a certain time frame. Developing countries are presently undergoing 
  market-oriented economic reforms. However, the price distortions are only partially 
  and gradually being remedied because of the high social costs associated with 
  speedy reforms. The complexities in modelling this process cannot be underestimated, 
  and it should therefore be recognized that only part of the transformation can 
  be captured. </p>
<p>Integration of market transformation processes in cost studies should include 
  an assessment of barrier removal policies. Such policies include efforts to 
  strengthen the incentives for exchange (prices, capital markets, international 
  capital, and donor assistance), to introduce new actors (institutional and human 
  capacity efforts), and to reduce the risk of participation (legal framework, 
  information, and general policy context of market regulation). Some of these 
  policies can be reflected in cost studies, such as barrier removal policies 
  that address market prices, capital markets, and technology transfers, while 
  other areas like capacity building need to be addressed in a more qualitative 
  way. </p>
<p>A number of important interrelationships and spillovers occur between the informal 
  and formal sectors with regard to climate change mitigation policies. An example 
  is the potential to introduce advanced production technologies in the energy 
  and agriculture sectors that, on the one hand, use domestic resources (e.g., 
  biomass) in a more sustainable way and, on the other, improve efficiency and 
  create capacity in local companies and institutions. The impact of introducing 
  policy instruments such as carbon taxes or energy subsidy removal also depends 
  on potential substitutions to non-commercial wood fuels that might be unsustainable. 
  Mitigation cost studies for developing countries should, as far as possible, 
  include an assessment of energy consumption and biomass potential in the informal 
  sector and apply assumptions about price relations and substitution elasticities 
  between the formal and informal sectors. Similarly studies should consider the 
  capacity of enterprises in both the formal and informal sectors to adapt and 
  manage the advanced technologies that are suggested as cost-effective mitigation 
  options in national programmes. </p>
