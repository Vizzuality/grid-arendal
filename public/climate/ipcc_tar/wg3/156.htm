<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Terrestrial ecosystems offer significant potential to capture and hold carbon 
  at modest social costs. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
  Second Assessment Report estimated that about 60 to 87GtC could be conserved 
  or sequestered in forests by the year 2050 and another 23 to 44 GtC could be 
  sequestered in agricultural soils. In this chapter, we describe and assess biological 
  mitigation measures in terrestrial ecosystems, focusing on the physical mitigation 
  potential, ecological and environmental constraints, economics, and social considerations. 
  Also the so-called geo-engineering options are discussed. </p>
<p>The mitigation costs through forestry can be quite modest, US$0.1&#150;US$20/tC 
  in some tropical developing countries, and somewhat higher (US$20&#150;US$100/tC) 
  in developed countries. The costs of biological mitigation, therefore, are low 
  compared to those of many other alternative measures. The costs would be expected 
  to rise, however, if large areas of land were taken from alternative uses. The 
  technologies for preserving existing terrestrial C and enhancing C pools, while 
  using biomass in a sustainable way, already exist and can be further improved. 
</p>
<p>Increased carbon pools from management of terrestrial ecosystems can only partially 
  offset fossil fuel emissions. Moreover, larger C stocks may pose a risk for 
  higher carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions in the future, if the C-conserving 
  practices are discontinued. For example, abandoning fire control in forests 
  or reverting to intensive tillage in agriculture may result in rapid loss of 
  at least part of the C accumulated during previous years. However, using biomass 
  as a fuel or wood to displace more energy-intensive materials in products can 
  provide permanent carbon mitigation benefits. It is useful to evaluate terrestrial 
  sequestration opportunities alongside emission reduction strategies as both 
  approaches will likely be required to control atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p>
<p>Carbon reservoirs in most ecosystems eventually approach some maximum level. 
  Thus, an ecosystem depleted of carbon by past events may have a high potential 
  rate of carbon accumulation, while one with a large carbon pool tends to have 
  a low rate of carbon sequestration. As ecosystems eventually approach their 
  maximum carbon pool, the sink (i.e., the rate of change of the pool) will diminish. 
  Although both the sequestration rate and pool of carbon may be relatively high 
  at some stages, they cannot be maximized simultaneously. Thus, management strategies 
  for an ecosystem may depend on whether the goal is to enhance short-term accumulation 
  or to maintain the carbon reservoirs through time. The ecologically achievable 
  balance between the two goals is constrained by disturbance history, site productivity, 
  and target time frame. For example, options to maximize sequestration by 2010 
  may not maximize sequestration by 2020 or 2050; in some cases, maximizing sequestration 
  by 2010 may lead to higher emissions in later years.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of C mitigation strategies, and the security of expanded 
  C pools, will be affected by future global changes, but the impacts of these 
  changes will vary by geographic region, ecosystem type, and local abilities 
  to adapt. For example, increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, changes in climate, 
  modified nutrient cycles, and altered disturbance regimes can each have negative 
  or positive effects on C pools in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
<p>In the past, land management has often resulted in reduced C pools, but in 
  many regions like Western Europe, C pools have now stabilized and are recovering. 
  In most countries in temperate and boreal regions forests are expanding, although 
  current C pools are still smaller than those in pre-industrial or pre-historic 
  times. While complete recovery of pre-historic C pools is unlikely, there is 
  potential for substantial increases in carbon stocks. The Food and Agriculture 
  Organization (FAO) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE)&#146;s statistics 
  suggest that the average net annual increment has exceeded timber fellings in 
  managed boreal and temperate forests in the early 1990s. For example, C stocks 
  in the live tree biomass has increased by 0.17billion tonnes (gigatonnes = Gt) 
  C/yr in the USA and 0.11GtC/yr in Western Europe, absorbing about 10% of global 
  fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for that time period. Though these estimates 
  do not include changes in litter and soils, they illustrate that land surfaces 
  play a significant and changing role in the atmospheric carbon budget and, hence, 
  provide potentially powerful opportunities for climate mitigation.</p>
<p>In some tropical countries, however, the average net loss of forest carbon 
  stocks continues, though rates of deforestation may have declined slightly in 
  the last decade. In agricultural lands, options are now available to recover 
  partially the C lost during the conversion from forest or grasslands.</p>
<p>Land is a precious and limited resource used for many purposes in every country. 
  The relationship of climate mitigation strategies with other land uses may be 
  competitive, neutral, or symbiotic. An analysis of the literature suggests that 
  C mitigation strategies can be pursued as one element of more comprehensive 
  strategies aimed at sustainable development, where increasing C stocks is but 
  one of many objectives. Often, measures can be adopted within forestry, agriculture, 
  and other land uses to provide C mitigation and, at the same time, also advance 
  other social, economic, and environmental goals. Carbon mitigation can provide 
  additional value and income to land management and rural development. Local 
  solutions and targets can be adapted to priorities of sustainable development 
  at national, regional, and global levels.</p>
<p>A key to making C mitigation activities effective and sustainable is to balance 
  C mitigation with other ecological and/or environmental, economic, and social 
  goals of land use. Many biological mitigation strategies may be neutral or favourable 
  for all three goals and become accepted as &#147;no regrets&#148; or &#147;win&#150;win&#148; 
  solutions. In other cases, compromises may be needed. Important potential environmental 
  impacts include effects on biodiversity, effects on amount and quality of water 
  resources (particularly where they are already scarce), and long-term impacts 
  on ecosystem productivity. Cumulative environmental, economic, and social impacts 
  could be assessed within individual projects and also from broader, national 
  and international perspectives. An important issue is &#147;leakage&#148; &#150; 
  an expanded or conserved C pool in one area leading to increased emissions elsewhere. 
  Social acceptance at the local, national, and global scale may also influence 
  how effectively mitigation policies are implemented.</p>
<p>In tropical regions, there are large opportunities for C mitigation, though 
  they cannot be considered in isolation from broader policies in forestry, agriculture, 
  and other sectors. Additionally, options vary by social and economic conditions: 
  in some regions, slowing or halting deforestation is the major mitigation opportunity; 
  in others, where deforestation rates have declined to marginal levels, improved 
  natural forest management practices and, afforestation and reforestation of 
  degraded forests and wastelands are the most attractive opportunities.</p>
<p>Non-tropical countries also have opportunities to preserve existing C pools, 
  enhance C pools, or use biomass to offset fossil fuel use. Examples of strategies 
  include fire or insect control, forest conservation, establishing fast-growing 
  stands, changing silvicultural practices, planting trees in urban areas, ameliorating 
  waste management practices, managing agricultural lands to store more C in soils, 
  improving management of grazing lands, and re-planting grasses or trees on cultivated 
  lands. </p>
<p>Wood and other biological products play several important roles in carbon mitigation: 
  they act as a carbon reservoir; they can replace construction materials that 
  require more fossil fuel input; and they can be burned in place of fossil fuels 
  for renewable energy. Wood products already contribute somewhat to climate mitigation, 
  but if infrastructures and incentives can be developed, wood and agricultural 
  products may become vital elements of a sustainable economy: they are among 
  the few renewable resources available on a large scale.<br>
  A comprehensive analysis of carbon mitigation measures would consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>potential contributions to C pools over time;</li>
  <li>sustainability, security, resilience, permanence, and robustness of the 
    C pool maintained or created;</li>
  <li>compatibility with other land-use objectives; </li>
  <li>leakage and additionality issues; </li>
  <li>economic costs; </li>
  <li>environmental impacts other than climate mitigation; </li>
  <li>social, cultural, and cross-cutting issues as well as issues of equity; 
    and </li>
  <li>the system-wide effects on C flows in the energy and materials sector. </li>
</ul>
<p>Activities undertaken for other reasons may enhance mitigation. An obvious 
  example is reduced rates of tropical deforestation. Furthermore, because wealthy 
  countries generally have a stable forest estate, it could be argued that economic 
  development is associated with activities that build up forest carbon reservoirs 
  in the long run.</p>
<p>Marine ecosystems may also offer possibilities for removing CO<sub>2</sub> 
  from the atmosphere. The standing stock of C in the marine biosphere is very 
  small, however, and efforts could focus not only on increasing biological C 
  stocks, but also on using biospheric processes to remove C from the atmosphere 
  and transport it to the deep ocean. Some initial experiments have been performed, 
  but fundamental questions remain about the permanence and stability of C removals, 
  and about possible unintended consequences of the large-scale manipulations 
  required to have significant impact on the atmosphere. In addition, the economics 
  of such approaches have not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Geo-engineering involves efforts to stabilize the climate system by directly 
  managing the energy balance of the earth, thereby overcoming the enhanced greenhouse 
  effect. Although there appear to be possibilities for engineering the terrestrial 
  energy balance, human understanding of the system is still rudimentary. The 
  likelihood of unanticipated consequences is large, and it may not even be possible 
  to engineer the regional distribution of temperature, precipitation, etc. Geo-engineering 
  raises scientific and technical questions as well as many ethical, legal, and 
  equity issues. And yet, some basic inquiry does seem appropriate. </p>
<p>In practice, by the year 2010 mitigation in land use, land-use change, and 
  forestry activities can lead to significant mitigation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 
  Many of these activities are compatible with, or complement, other objectives 
  in managing land. The overall effects of altering marine ecosystems to act as 
  carbon sinks or of applying geo-engineering technology in climate change mitigation 
  remain unresolved and are not, therefore, ready for near-term application.</p>
