<h4>3.3.4.2 Reducing Standby Power Losses in Appliances and Equipment</h4>
<p>Improving the energy efficiency of appliances and equipment can result in reduced 
  energy consumption in the range of 10 to 70%, with the most typical savings 
  in the 30% to 40% range (Acosta Moreno <i>et al</i>., 1996; Turiel <i>et al</i>., 1997). Implementation 
  of advanced technologies in refrigerator/freezers, clothes washers, clothes 
  dryers, electric water heaters, and residential lighting in the US is estimated 
  to save 3.35EJ/yr by 2010, reducing energy use of these appliances by nearly 
  50% from the base case (Turiel <i>et al</i>., 1997). </p>
<p>A number of residential appliances and electronic devices, such as televisions, 
  audio equipment, telephone answering machines, refrigerators, dishwashers, and 
  ranges consume electricity while in a standby or off mode (Meier <i>et al</i>., 1992; 
  Herring, 1996; Meier and Huber, 1997; Molinder, 1997; Sanchez, 1997). These 
  standby power losses are estimated to consume 12% of Japanese residential electricity, 
  5% of US residential electricity, and slightly less in European countries (Nakagami 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997; Meier <i>et al</i>., 1998). Metering studies have shown that such standby 
  losses can be reduced to one watt in most of these mass-produced goods (Meier 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998). The costs of key low-loss technologies, such as more efficient 
  switch-mode power supplies and smarter batteries, are low (Nadel <i>et al</i>., 1998) 
  and a recent study found that if all US appliances were replaced by units meeting 
  the 1-watt target, aggregate standby losses would fall at least 70%, saving 
  the USA over US$2 billion annually (Meier <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>

<h4>3.3.4.3 Photovoltaic Systems for Buildings</h4>
<p>Photovoltaic systems are being increasingly used in rural off-grid locations, 
  especially in developing countries, to provide electricity to areas not yet 
  connected to the power infrastructure or to offset fossil fuel generated electricity. 
  These systems are most commonly used to provide electricity for lighting, but 
  are also used for water pumping, refrigeration, evaporative cooling, ventilation 
  fans, air conditioning, and powering various electronic devices. In 1995, more 
  than 200,000 homes worldwide depended on photovoltaic systems for all of their 
  electricity needs (US DOE, 1999a). Between 1986 and 1998, global PV sales grew 
  from 37MW to 150MW (US DOE, 1999b). Rural electrification programmes have been 
  established in many developing countries. In Brazil, more than 1000 small stand-alone 
  systems that provide power for lighting, TVs, and radios were recently installed 
  in homes and schools, while two hybrid (PV-wind-battery) power systems were 
  installed in the Amazon Basin to reduce the use of diesel generators that supply 
  power to more than 300 villages in that area (Taylor, 1997). Similar projects 
  have been initiated in South Africa (Arent, 1998), Egypt (Taylor and Abulfotuh, 
  1997), India (Stone and Ullal, 1997; US DOE, 1999b), Mexico (Secretaria de Energia, 
  1997), China, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Uganda, Solomon Islands, 
  and Tanzania (Williams, 1996). Recent developments promoting increased adoption 
  of photovoltaic systems include the South African Solar Rural Electrification 
  Project (Shell International, 1999), the US Million Solar Roofs Initiative (US 
  DOE, 1999a), the effort to install 5000MW on residences in Japan by 2010 (Advisory 
  Committee for Energy, 1998), and net metering, which allows the electric meters 
  of customers with renewable energy generating facilities to be reversed when 
  the generators are producing energy in excess of residential requirements (US 
  DOE, 1999b).</p>

<h4>3.3.4.4 Distributed Power Generation for Buildings</h4>
<p>Distributed power generation relies on small power generation or storage systems 
  located near or at the building site. Several small scale (below 500kW), dispersed 
  power-generating technologies are advancing quite rapidly. These technologies 
  include both renewable and fossil fuel powered alternatives, such as photovoltaics 
  and microturbines. Moving power generation closer to electrical end-uses results 
  in reduced system electrical losses, the potential for combined heat and power 
  applications (especially for building cooling), and opportunities to better 
  co-ordinate generation and end-use, which can together more than compensate 
  for the lower conversion efficiency and result in overall energy systems that 
  are both less expensive and emit less carbon dioxide than the familiar central 
  power generating station. The likelihood of customer sites becoming net generators 
  will be determined by the configuration of the building and/or site, the opportunities 
  for on-site use of cogenerated heat, the availability and relative cost of fuels, 
  and utility interconnection, environmental, building code, and other regulatory 
  restrictions (NRECA, 2000).</p>
