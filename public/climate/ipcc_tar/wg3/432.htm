<h2>10.4 Policy-relevant Scientific Questions in Climate Change Response </h2>
<h3><a name="1041"></a>10.4.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>In this section a selected set of key policy-relevant scientific questions 
  is examined in some detail. It surveys new developments and new results to foster 
  our ability to make critical choices in climate policy, such as striking the 
  right balance between mitigation and adaptation, the timing and location of 
  actions, the costs of actions, and options to reduce and share them. After a 
  brief discussion of the broad climate policy portfolio, the focus is on mitigation 
  questions. The issues involved in these policy responses are structured as follows.</p>
<p>What should the response be? What are the most important factors to consider 
  in crafting a short- to medium-term portfolio of mitigation and adaptation actions, 
  and in acquiring information to resolve the large uncertainties? Drawing largely 
  on IAMs, <a href="433.htm">Section 10.4.2</a> takes a closer look at the first 
  two components.</p>
<p>When should the response be made? The relationship between the timing of various 
  types of mitigation responses, their costs, and their social, economic, technological, 
  and environmental implications, raises a broad array of policy issues. The most 
  important insights are summarized in <a href="439.htm">Section 10.4.3</a>.</p>
<p>Where should the response take place? Closely related to the timing issue, 
  the location of mitigation responses is a multifacetted concern also. While 
  the environmental value of a given amount of unreleased GHG is equal wherever 
  its abatement takes place, there are far-reaching implications of whether and 
  to what extent nations are allowed to use international flexibility instruments. 
  The questions range from cost and efficiency concerns, to incentives for technological 
  development, to implementation and verification problems. <a href="441.htm">Section 
  10.4.4</a> summarizes some of the aspects.</p>
<p>Who should pay for the response? The location of the mitigation action can 
  largely be separated from the question of who carries the costs. Numerous guidelines 
  have been proposed for burden sharing. They range from historical responsibility, 
  to various equity principles, to efficiency and international competitiveness 
  concerns. Some fundamental points are reviewed in <a href="445.htm">Section 
  10.4.5</a>.</p>
<p>Towards what objective should the response be targetted? Current analyses of 
  climate change impacts, adaptations, and mitigation normally cover the range 
  between 450 and 850ppmv CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent concentration or an increase 
  of between 1&deg;C and 6&deg;C in the global mean temperature. Completing the 
  circle that started with the discussion of how the costs and benefits of balancing 
  mitigation and adaptation activities influence the choice of the climate and/or 
  GHG stabilization target, the issue of high versus low levels of stabilization 
  is raised again in <a href="448.htm">Section 10.4.6</a>.</p>
