<h4>6.2.2.6.3 Green Power </h4>
<p>Green power policies establish mechanisms through which part of the electricity 
  supply (whether in a regulated or competitive environment) must come from designated 
  renewable energy sources. Regulatory policy mandates include set-asides for 
  renewables, renewable portfolio standards (RPSs), and various kinds of subsidies 
  created from SBCs or renewable energy funds. The cost of compliance for policy 
  mandates is borne by all consumers. Despite this 100% participation, however, 
  the policies may or may not be effective in stimulating renewable energy generation, 
  depending on how aggressive they are and how they are implemented. Some examples 
  are given in <a href="#box66">Boxes 6.6</a> and <a href="244.htm#box68">6.8</a>. 
  To reduce the cost of compliance regulatory policy may be supplemented by tradable 
  renewable energy certificates as described in <a href="#box67">Box 6.7</a>.</p>

    <td class="box"><b>Box 6.6. Examples of Policies to Promote Renewables in 
      a Liberalized Power Market </b> 
      <p><i>Renewables Set-aside</i><br>
        The UK has been promoting wind and other renewable energy technologies 
        through its Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO; see Mitchell, 1995a, 1997). 
        The renewable NFFO sets aside a certain portion of the electricity market 
        to be supplied by designated renewable energy technologies under a competitive 
        bidding framework. Within each technology band (wind, biomass, landfills, 
        solar, etc.) developers submit bids of proposed projects and the projects 
        with the lowest cost/kWh price are awarded power purchase contracts. Regional 
        electricity companies are mandated to purchase power from NFFO-awarded 
        renewable electricity generators at a premium price. The companies are 
        reimbursed for the difference between the NFFO premium price and the average 
        monthly power pool purchasing price through the Fossil Fuel Levy (Mitchell, 
        1995a). The main weakness of the NFFO is that the implementation rate 
        of approved projects is very low, because bids have such low cost/kWh 
        that they do not allow the profitable operation of projects. Moreover, 
        the intermittent character of NFFO rounds has precluded the development 
        of a steady domestic market for renewable technologies (Michaelowa, 2000).</p>
      <p><i>Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)</i><br>
        The RPS has received considerable attention in the USA. The RPS is similar 
        to the NFFO concept in the UK, in that both are competitive least-cost 
        mechanisms. Unlike NFFO there is no funding levy. Under RPS, all retail 
        power suppliers are required to obtain a certain minimum percentage (e.g. 
        5%) of their electricity from specified renewable energy sources. Efficiency 
        is obtained by allowing the market to determine the most cost-effective 
        solution for each electricity retailer (Radar, 1996; Haddad and Jefferis, 
        1999). State legislatures and/or public utility commissions have approved 
        various versions of RPS in several US states (Wiser, 1999b).</p>
      <p><i>Production Subsidy and/or System-benefit Charges (SBCs)</i><br>
        Another support mechanism to promote renewables in a liberalized electricity 
        market is a fee/kWh on all energy users to support renewable energy development. 
        This charge is often referred to as SBCs (Haddad and Jefferis, 1999). 
        In California, a total of US$540 million collected from 1998 up to 2002 
        from electricity customers is directed to support existing, new, and emerging 
        renewable electricity generation technologies (California Assembly Bill, 
        1996, AB 1890, Ch. 854, Sec. 381). In addition, nine other states in the 
        USA have established SBC policies under the restructuring of their electric 
        utility industries to promote the use of renewables (Wiser, 1999b). Unlike 
        in NFFO and RPS, there is no supplier obligation.</p>

<p>Green power and green pricing programmes encourage consumers to voluntarily 
  pay a higher price for electricity generated from &#147;green&#148; (environmentally 
  friendly) energy sources. Green power products are offered by some suppliers 
  where electricity markets have been liberalized, while green pricing is a green 
  power option offered by the monopoly utility in jurisdictions where consumers 
  are not yet permitted to choose their retail provider (Swezey and Bird, 2000). 
  Green power marketing programmes are relatively new, dating from 1993, and are 
  being implemented in Australia, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, UK, 
  and USA (Markard, 1998; Crawford-Smith, 1999; Holt, 2000a, 2000b).</p>
<p>In the USA, about 30 green power products are being marketed by 15 retailers 
  in competitive states and about 140 electric utilities offer a green pricing 
  option that emphasizes wind or photovoltaics (Holt and Wiser, 1998; Holt, 2000b). 
  Market penetration so far is low, a little over 1% on average, although it reaches 
  as high as 4%&#150;5% for a few utility programmes (Wortmann <i>et al</i>., 1996; Holt, 
  2000a, 2000b). Of those who switch suppliers in competitive markets, some 20%&#150;95% 
  choose a green power product (the higher percentage results from significant 
  renewable energy subsidies in California).</p>
<p>Wiser <i>et al</i>. (2000) assessed green power marketing programmes in the USA. They 
  conclude that the collective impact of customer-driven demand for renewable 
  energy has been modest to date, but that it is too early to draw definitive 
  conclusions about the potential contribution of green power marketing in the 
  long run.</p>
<p>In support of green power marketing and of policies that mandate renewable 
  set-asides and RPSs, renewable energy certificates (also called credits, labels, 
  or tags) may be traded separately from green electricity. Whether renewable 
  energy or other environmental attributes should remain with the purchaser of 
  the underlying commodity, or be sold to different entities, is under debate. 
  There are either plans for or limited experience with tradable certificates 
  in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, UK, and USA, and it is likely to grow 
  in importance (Benner, 2000; Rucker, 2000). Trading in renewable energy certificates 
  promises greater liquidity and potentially lower costs to meet policy commitments 
  and marketing claims. An example is given in <a href="#box67">Box 6.7</a>.</p>

    <td class="box"><b>Box 6.7. Green Certificates for Wind Energy in the Netherlands 
      </b> 
      <p>Support for wind energy in the Netherlands has included both R&amp;D 
        grants and a variety of market-stimulation mechanisms. These have included 
        an integrated programme for wind energy, which provided subsidies of 35&#150;40% 
        of investment costs for newly built turbines. Electricity distribution 
        companies raised environmental levies to purchase wind generated kiloWatt 
        hours for high guaranteed prices (about US$0.07; Wolsink, 1996). More 
        recently, however, significant changes have occurred in the Dutch renewable 
        energy policy, reinforced by the liberalization of the electricity market. 
        Most of the direct subsidies are now eliminated and other market-oriented 
        and fiscal mechanisms introduced. One such mechanism is the green certificates 
        market, which started in 1998. By law, local energy distribution companies 
        must purchase renewable electricity from independent power generators. 
        Distribution companies issue green certificates to the renewable generators 
        equal to the amount of renewable kiloWatt hours sold to the grid. The 
        renewable generator can then sell these green certificates on an open 
        market to distribution companies that want to sell green-certified electricity 
        (Schaeffer <i>et al</i>., 1999). Green electricity is exempt from energy taxes, 
        which will be raised to about US$0.06/kWh in 2001. The tax exemption makes 
        wind energy competitive with electricity from conventional sources, and 
        thus the subsidies are obsolete.</p>
