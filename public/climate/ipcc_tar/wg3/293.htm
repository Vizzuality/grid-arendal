<h3>7.3.5 Cost Implications of Alternative GHG Emission Reduction Options and 
  Carbon Sinks </h3>
<p>For a wide variety of options, the costs of mitigation depend on what regulatory 
  framework is adopted by national governments to reduce GHGs. In general, the 
  more flexibility the framework allows, the lower the costs of achieving a given 
  reduction. A stringent, inflexible carbon-mitigation policy induces greater 
  economic burden than a loose, flexible policy. More flexibility and more trading 
  partners can reduce costs. The opposite is expected with inflexible rules and 
  few trading partners. </p>
<p>Flexibility can be measured as the ability to reduce carbon emissions at the 
  lowest cost, either domestically or internationally, including &#147;when and 
  where&#148; flexibility&#151;which assumes a world emissions budget could be 
  spent optimally over space and time to capture all potential intra- and intertemporal 
  efficiencies. Providing a firm or nation with more flexibility to reach a given 
  target and timetable also reduces costs.</p>
<p>The details as to how flexibility is achieved matter. Many advocates prefer 
  emissions trading over carbon taxes because the quantity of carbon flowing into 
  the atmosphere is fixed, thereby shifting risk from the environment to the economy 
  in the form of price uncertainty. However, some suggestions on the design of 
  emissions trading create relatively high transaction costs that would limit 
  the cost savings of a trading system. Furthermore, the key issue of how the 
  emissions rights should be allocated has yet to be resolved (IPCC, 1996a; Jepma 
  and Munasinghe, 1998).</p>
<p>Another source of flexibility is to include carbon sinks in the policy framework. 
  Recall that a carbon sink is a process that destroys or absorbs GHGs, such as 
  the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by terrestrial (e.g., trees) and 
  oceanic biota. The main anthropogenic sink is tree planting and other forest 
  management actions. Soils and other types of vegetation also provide a potential 
  sink. It is estimated that forests around the world contain roughly about 1,146GtC 
  in their vegetation and soil, with about twice as much in soil as in vegetation 
  (See IPCC, 2000c). For the USA, forests are an important terrestrial sink, given 
  that they cover about 750 million acres (about 300 million hectares). Land use 
  changes in the USA have increased the uptake of carbon to an estimated 200MtCeq. 
</p>
<p>A few studies found that carbon sequestration through sinks could cost as little 
  as US$25/tonne C in the USA for 150MtCeq (Stavins, 1999). But serious uncertainties 
  remain about how to measure and account for estimates of net carbon. For example, 
  how forest management activities affect soil carbon is unknown, and since forest 
  soils contain over 50% of the total stored forest carbon in the USA, this difference 
  can have a significant impact on estimates. And some researchers have shown 
  that sinks are not as effective as predicted when the interaction of forest 
  reserves and the timber market is accounted for. The more land that is set aside 
  for carbon sinks, the quicker the cycle of harvesting on other forestland, and 
  the less total net carbon sequestration. Some fear that these ambiguities about 
  sinks could divert attention from first-order priorities to second-order technicalities 
  (Jacoby <i>et al</i>., 1998). </p>
<p>To sum up, flexibility in the regulatory framework can play a major role in 
  reducing the costs of GHG emissions reduction. The extent to which particular 
  instruments can be adopted, however, depends on resolving serious political 
  differences as to how the burden of emissions reduction should be shared, between 
  developed countries themselves, and between both developed and developing countries. 
  It is important also not to underestimate the costs of implementing changes 
  in regulatory policy (see <a href="277.htm">Section 7.2.3</a>), especially in 
  developing countries. For some of the practical problems in using flexible instruments 
  in such countries, see Seroa da Motta <i>et al</i>. (1999).</p>
