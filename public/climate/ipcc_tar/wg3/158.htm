<h2><a name="42"></a>4.2 Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Carbon Cycling in Terrestrial 
  Ecosystems </h2>
<p>Terrestrial ecosystems provide an active mechanism (photosynthesis) for biological 
  removal of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. They act as reservoirs of photosynthetically-fixed 
  C by storing it in various forms in plant tissues, in dead organic material, 
  and in soils. Terrestrial ecosystems also provide a flow of harvestable products 
  that not only contain carbon but also compete in the market place with fossil 
  fuels, and with other materials for construction (such as cement), and for other 
  purposes (such as plastics) that also have implications for the global carbon 
  cycle (see <a href="#box41">Box 4.1</a>).</p>

      <p><b>Box 4.1. Stocks and Flows </b></p>
      <p>The global carbon cycle consists of the various stocks of carbon in the 
        earth system and the flows of carbon between these stocks. It is discussed 
        at length in IPCC WG I (Prentice <i>et al</i>., 2001) and IPCC Special Report 
        on LULUCF (IPCC, 2000a) and is illustrated in <a href="158.htm#fig42">Figure

            and human activities. The carbon stocks associated with the different 
            ecosystems are stored in aboveground and belowground biomass, detrital 
            material (dead organic matter), and soils. Carbon is withdrawn from 
            the atmosphere through photosynthesis (vertical down arrow), and returned 
            by oxidation processes that include plant respiration, decomposition, 
            and combustion (vertical up arrow). Carbon is also transferred within 
            ecosystems and to other locations (horizontal arrows). Both natural 
            processes and human activities affect carbon flows. Mitigation activities 
            directed at one ecosystem component generally have additional effects 
            influencing carbon accumulation in, or loss from, other components. 
            Estimates of ecosystem and atmospheric C stocks are adapted from Bolin 
            <i>et al</i>. (2000). Values for C stocks in some ecosystems are still 
            very uncertain. Not shown are estimates of C stocks in tundra (127GtC), 
            deserts and semi-deserts (199GtC), and oceans (approx. 39,000GtC) 
            (numbers are taken from Special Report on LULUCF, Fig 1-1, page 30; 
            IPCC, 2000a).</td>

      <p>A consequence of the conservation of mass is that the net of all of the 
        flows (measured as a rate variable in units such as tC/yr) into and out 
        of a given reservoir or stock (measured in units such as tC) during a 
        period of time must equal the change in the stock (tC) in that period. 
        Conversely, a change in stock of a reservoir during a given period must 
        exactly equal the integrated net difference in C flows into and out of 
        that reservoir during that period. Elsewhere in this text the word &#147;pool&#148; 
        is sometimes used to represent the various reservoirs of carbon in the 
        global carbon cycle. The word &#147;sink&#148; is used to indicate the 
        net positive flow of carbon into a terrestrial carbon pool.</p>
      <p>The maximum rate of net ecosystem carbon uptake cannot occur at the same 
        time as the maximum ecosystem carbon stock (see <a href="158.htm#fig43">Figure 
        4.3</a>). An ecosystem depleted of carbon by past events may have much 
        higher rates of carbon accumulation than a comparable one in which carbon 
        stocks have been maintained. Ecosystems eventually approach some maximum 
        carbon stock &#150; a carrying capacity &#150; at which time the flows 
        into the carbon pool are balanced by flows out of the carbon pool. Because 
        C sink and C stock in ecosystems cannot be maximized simultaneously, mitigation 
        activities aimed at enhancing the sink and maintaining the biological 
        carbon stock coincide only partially (IGBP, 1998).<a name="fig43"></a>

          <td class="figure"><b>Figure 4.3:</b> An example of net changes in ecosystem 
            carbon stocks over time. Changes in individual ecosystem components 
            take place at different rates, but it is the net of the changes in 
            all interconnected pools that determines the net flow to or from the 
            atmosphere. In the example, the accumulation of biomass initially 
            is at a lower rate than the decomposition of the dead organic matter 
            stock so the stock of ecosystem C declines. Later in the cycle, dead 
            organic matter stocks may increase, although other components have 
            reached a steady state. Maximum ecosystem stocks (highest value of 
            ecosystem C) occur at a later time than the maximum rate of net carbon 
            uptake (steepest slope of the ecosystem C line).</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Similarly, the maximum rate of C substitution cannot occur at the same 
        time as maximum C conservation. High rates of carbon substitution, through 
        use of forest products or biofuels, generally require high productivity 
        and efficient manufacture and use of derived products.</p>
      <p>Carbon taken up by the biosphere may also accumulate in offsite pools 
        &#150; as products or in landfills &#150; but it continues to oxidize 
        at rates that depend on the conditions of those pools. It is the net of 
        many flows that defines the changes in carbon stocks of off-site pools 
        as well as of on-site pools. Carbon accumulation in off-site pools is 
        an often overlooked, but a potentially important, form of sequestration.</p>

<p>Human activities have changed terrestrial carbon pools. The largest changes 
  occurred with the conversion of natural ecosystems to arable lands. Such disruptions 
  typically result in a large reduction of vegetation biomass and a loss of about 
  30% of the C in the surface 1 metre of soil (Davidson and Ackermann, 1993; Anderson, 
  1995; Houghton, 1995a; Kolchugina <i>et al</i>., 1995). Globally, conversion to arable 
  agriculture has resulted in soil C losses of about 50GtC (Harrison <i>et al</i>., 1993; 
  Scharpenseel and Becker-Heidmann, 1994; Houghton, 1995a; Cole <i>et al</i>., 1996; 
  Paustian <i>et al</i>., 2000), and total emissions of C from land use change, including 
  that from biomass loss, have amounted to about 122 &plusmn; 40GtC (Houghton, 
  1995b; Schimel, 1995). Most of the soil C losses occur within a few years or 
  decades of conversion, so that in temperate zones, where there is little expansion 
  of agricultural lands now, losses of C have largely abated (Cole <i>et al</i>., 1993; 
  Anderson, 1995; Janzen <i>et al</i>., 1998; Larionova <i>et al</i>., 1998). Tropical areas, 
  however, remain an important source of CO<sub>2</sub> because of widespread 
  clearing of new lands and reduced duration of &#147;fallow&#148; periods in 
  shifting agriculture systems (Paustian <i>et al</i>., 1997b; Scholes and van Breemen, 
  1997; Woomer <i>et al</i>., 1997; Mosier, 1998).</p>
<p>The competition for land varies among countries and within a country. Land-use 
  and forestry policies for C management may be most successful when climate mitigation 
  is considered alongside other needs for land, including agriculture, forestry, 
  agroforestry, biodiversity, soil and water conservation, and recreation. Forest 
  fires, for example, are controlled, in many parts of the world, not as a measure 
  for carbon mitigation, but simply because fire threatens areas of human settlement 
  and the habitats of living organisms.</p>
<p>Similarly, biodiversity and landscape considerations have motivated protection 
  of old-growth stands in temperate, boreal, and tropical rain forests from commercial 
  logging. In many cases such decisions have prevented C release into the atmosphere, 
  even though C mitigation was not the initial intent (Harmon <i>et al</i>., 1990). The 
  impact of harvest restrictions on C pool in old-growth forests may be affected 
  by &#147;leakage&#148;. If one ecosystem is protected but timber demand remains 
  constant, logging may simply be shifted to another, similar ecosystem elsewhere, 
  perhaps to a country where conservation priorities are lower.</p>
