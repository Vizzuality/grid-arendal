<p>Inadequate attention to implementation at both national and international levels 
  is largely the reason why many international agreements have fallen short of 
  their promise (Victor et al., 1998). Moreover, as the policy agenda has grown 
  more demanding, international agreements play an ever greater role in affecting 
  and co-ordinating the behaviour of national governments that have undertaken 
  the international obligations and became responsible for meeting them. These 
  agreements also influence the activities and responses of non-state actors (such 
  as firms, individuals, scientists, interest groups, consumer and environmental 
  groups), whose activities are affected by the international treaties after national 
  governments adopt rules and policies for domestic implementation of the international 
  regime. The importance of implementation has increased, and climate change is 
  a good example of this. The stakeholders come to play an increasing role in 
  design and implementation of the treaties (Michaelowa, 1998b; Victor et al., 
  1998; De La Vega Navarro, 2000), and to involve them more broadly makes this 
  process more effective.</p>
<p>Success or failure in the implementation of international environmental agreements 
  depends to a large extent on how they are implemented in countries, once the 
  parties to the agreements have returned back home. The process of domestic implementation 
  of international environmental arrangements is very important to the overall 
  effectiveness of the treaty. Results of attempts to develop co-operative solutions 
  to international environmental problems are found in the domestic setting of 
  the decision-making (Hanf and Underdahl, 1995; Hanf and Underdal, 2000). Indeed, 
  to understand what is likely to happen at the international level, it is necessary 
  to examine the underlying factors and processes, structures, and values at the 
  national level (Kawashima, 1997; Kotov et al., 1997; Kawashima, 2000). These 
  determine the manner in which national positions on negotiating international 
  agreements are arrived at and the ultimate agreements are then carried out. 
  In turn, the expectation is that what has happened or is happening in various 
  international arenas influences these domestic processes and decisions within 
  individual countries; thus, national&#150;international linkages within the 
  decision-making process are very strong.</p>
<p>The decision-making and policy-making processes pertaining to international 
  co-operation in the environmental field may be represented as a sequence of 
  three interrelated phases (Hanf and Underdal, 1995):</p>
<ul>
  <li>formation of national preferences and policy positions for international 
    negotiation;<br>
  </li>
  <li>translation of national preferences into international collective action; 
    and <br>
  </li>
  <li>implementation of international agreements at the national level.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two phases are analyzed from both economic and political science 
  perspectives. As for the third phase, studies demonstrate that there are no 
  standard decisions or standard implementation processes for the international 
  environmental regimes. Even countries with similar political, economic, and 
  social systems adopt different approaches, and within countries the implementation 
  process varies markedly among different sectors. It is expected that implementation 
  of the climate change international regime will illustrate this conclusion, 
  and the canvas for the decision-making process will be extremely intricate and 
  complex.</p>
<p>The literature on compliance and implementation indicates that a variance in 
  the extent to which parties to international agreements fulfil their obligations, 
  and that the extent of national compliance also varies across international 
  regimes (Jacobson and Brown Weiss, 1995; Downs et al., 1996; Brown Weiss, 1999; 
  Young, 1999).</p>
<p>Signing (and ratification) of an international agreement constitutes no guarantee 
  that it will be implemented effectively and complied with. Nor does the refusal 
  to sign an agreement necessarily mean that an actor will act contrary to its 
  terms. Moreover, an actor may comply with some provisions (e.g., procedural 
  obligations), but not with others (e.g., substantive rules that require major 
  behavioural change), and meet some obligations partially (for example, by reducing 
  emissions, but less and/or later than required by the agreement). It is necessary 
  to note that rule-consistent behaviour may not always be induced by the treaty, 
  or necessarily result from the existence of a particular agreement. For one 
  thing, some international agreements do not require that all actors change their 
  behaviour&#151;some actors may already behave as prescribed by regime rules 
  (Brown Weiss and Jacobson, 1998). Moreover, in some cases for which behavioural 
  change is prescribed, the required change may come about without any deliberate 
  effort to meet the obligation, and compliance without implementation occurs. 
  For example, the recent sharp economic recession in Russia (more than a 50% 
  decrease in Gross National Product (GNP) during the 1990s) resulted in sufficient 
  pollutant-emission reduction from industrial and other activities to meet (and 
  even to &#147;over-comply with&#148;) the domestic targets set by a number of 
  international agreements. Little effort was required on the part of the government 
  or non-government actors to honour these commitments (Kotov and Nikitina, 1996, 
  1998). A number of recent research efforts conclude that most domestic behavioural 
  change can be attributed to many exogenous factors, and is not induced directly 
  by the international regime, but this change contributes to compliance with 
  the regime goals and targets (Levy et al., 1995). These specifics affect seriously 
  decision-making patterns regarding the implementation of the climate change 
  regime.</p>
<p>Recent research brings together several important paths that can influence 
  the variance in the extent to which parties fulfil their obligations (Haas et 
  al., 1993; O&#146;Riordan and J&auml;ger, 1996; Z&uuml;rn, 1996; Peterson, 1997; 
  Victor et al., 1998). Enhancement of a contractual environment refers to the 
  high relevance of an institution&#146;s transparency and credibility. An effective 
  design introduces a shared set of norms and rules, provides information about 
  membership and compliance, and helps to reduce transaction costs. Concern building 
  describes the potential influence of institutions on actors&#146; beliefs and 
  ideas. These actors create, collect, and disseminate scientific knowledge and 
  serve as centres for social learning processes. Capacity building refers to 
  asymmetries across countries and their restrictive effects on an international 
  commitment and to the possibilities of overcoming them. International institutions 
  can manage transfers of cognitive, administrative, and material capacities to 
  enable states to agree and comply with obligations. A broadly accepted management 
  of non-compliance in many cases can lead to more effective solutions to defection. 
  This approach of flexible responses covers various instruments, such as dispute 
  resolution, interacting measures of assistance and persuasion, incentives, and 
  greater transparency. Participation by &#147;target groups&#148; (e.g., regulated 
  industries) and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) reduces uncertainty, 
  leads to more realistic agreements, and helps to ensure that countries put them 
  into practice.</p>
