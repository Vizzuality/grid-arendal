<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Using resources to mitigate greenhouse gases (GHGs) generates opportunity costs 
  that should be considered to help guide reasonable policy decisions. Actions 
  to abate GHG emissions or increase carbon sinks divert resources from other 
  uses like health care and education. Assessing these costs should consider the 
  total value that society attaches to the goods and services forgone because 
  of the diversion of resources to climate protection. In some cases, the benefits 
  of mitigation could exceed the costs, and thus society gains from mitigation.</p>
<p>This chapter addresses the methodological issues that arise in the estimation 
  of the monetary costs of climate change. The focus is on the correct assessment 
  of the costs of mitigation measures to reduce the emissions of GHGs. The assessment 
  of costs and benefits should be based on a systematic analytical framework to 
  ensure comparability of estimates and transparency of logic. One well-developed 
  framework assesses costs as changes in social welfare based on individual values. 
  These individual values are reflected by the willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental 
  improvements or their willingness to accept (WTA) compensation. From these value 
  measures can be derived measures such as the social surpluses gained or lost 
  from a policy, the total resource costs, and opportunity costs. </p>
<p>While the underlying measures of welfare have limits and using monetary values 
  remains controversial, the view is taken that the methods to &#147;convert&#148; 
  non-market inputs into monetary terms provide useful information for policymakers. 
  These methods should be pursued when and where appropriate. It is also considered 
  useful to supplement this welfare-based cost methodology with a broader assessment 
  that includes physical impacts when possible. In practice, the challenge is 
  to develop a consistent and comprehensive definition of the key impacts to be 
  measured. In this chapter the costing methodology is overviewed, and issues 
  involved in using these methods addressed.</p>
<p>The costs of climate protection are affected by decisions on some key elements, 
  the analytical structure, and the assumptions made. Among other key presumptions, 
  these include the definition of the baseline, assumption about associated costs 
  and benefits that arise in conjunction with GHG emission reduction policies, 
  the flexibility available to find the carbon emissions of lowest cost, the possibility 
  of no regret options, the discount rate, the assumption of the rate of autonomous 
  technological change, and whether revenue is recycled.</p>
<p>First, defining the baseline is a key part of cost assessment. The baseline 
  is the GHG emissions that would occur in the absence of climate change interventions. 
  It helps determine how expensive GHG emissions reduction might be. The baseline 
  rests on key assumptions about future economic policies at the macroeconomic 
  and sectoral levels, including structure, resource intensity, relative prices, 
  technology choice, and the rate of technology adoption. The baseline also depends 
  on presumptions of future development patterns in the economy, like population 
  growth, economic growth, and technological change.</p>
<p>Second, climate change policies may have a number of side-impacts on local 
  and regional air pollution associated, and indirect effects on issues such as 
  transportation, agriculture, land use practices, employment, and fuel security. 
  These side-impacts can be negative as well as positive and the inclusion of 
  the impacts then can tend to generate higher as well as lower climate change 
  mitigation costs compared with studies that do not include such side-impacts.</p>
<p>Third, for a wide variety of options, the costs of mitigation depend on the 
  regulatory framework adopted by national governments to reduce GHGs. The more 
  flexibility allowed by the framework, the lower the costs of achieving a given 
  reduction. More flexibility and more trading partners can reduce costs, as a 
  firm can search out the lowest-cost alternative. The opposite is expected with 
  inflexible rules and few trading partners. </p>
<p>Fourth, no regrets options are by definition actions to reduce GHG emissions 
  that have negative net costs. Net costs are negative because these options generate 
  direct or indirect benefits large enough to offset the costs to implement the 
  options. The existence of no regrets potential implies that people choose not 
  to exercise some carbon-reducing options because of relative prices and preferences, 
  or that some markets and institutions do not behave perfectly. The presumption 
  of effective policies that capture large no regrets options reduces costs. </p>
<p>Fifth, there are two approaches to discounting&#151;an ethical or prescriptive 
  approach based on what rates of discount should be applied, and a descriptive 
  approach based on what rates of discount people (savers as well as investors) 
  actually apply in their day-to-day decisions. For mitigation analysis, the country 
  must base its decisions at least partly on discount rates that reflect the opportunity 
  cost of capital. Rates that range from 4% to 6% would probably be justified 
  in developed countries. The rate could be as high as 10%&#150;12% in developing 
  countries. It is more of a challenge to argue that climate change mitigation 
  projects should face different rates, unless the mitigation project is of very 
  long duration. Note that these rates do not reflect private rates of return, 
  which typically must be greater to justify a project, at around 10%&#150;25%. 
</p>
<p>Sixth, modellers account for the penetration of technological change over time 
  through a technical coefficient called the &#147;autonomous energy efficiency 
  improvement&#148; (AEEI). AEEI reflects the rate of change in the energy intensity 
  (the ratio of energy to gross domestic product) holding energy prices constant. 
  The presumed autonomous technological improvement in the energy intensity of 
  an economy can lead to significant differences in the estimated costs of mitigation. 
  As such, many observers view the choice of AEEI as crucial in setting the baseline 
  in which to judge the costs of mitigation. The costs of mitigation are inversely 
  related the AEEI&#150;a greater AEEI the lower the costs to reach any given 
  climate target. The costs decrease because people adopt low-carbon technology 
  unrelated to changes in relative prices.</p>
<p>Other issues to be considered in the assessment of mitigation policies include 
  the marginal cost of public funds, capital costs, and side effects. Policies 
  such as carbon taxes or auctioned (tradable) carbon-emissions permits generate 
  revenues that can be recycled to reduce other taxes that are likely to be distortionary. 
  There has been considerable debate as to whether such revenue recycling might 
  eliminate the economic costs of such mitigation policies. Theoretical studies 
  indicate that this result can occur in economies with highly inefficient tax 
  systems. Some empirical studies obtain the no-cost result, although many such 
  studies do not. Tax recycling reflects several complicated assumptions in the 
  baseline and policy case regarding the structure of the tax system and the overall 
  policy framework, among others. Target setting and timing also affect cost estimates. 
  Reduction targets defined as percentage reductions of future GHG emissions create 
  significant uncertainty about GHG emission levels. </p>
<p>In addition, several issues on technology use in developing countries and economies 
  in transition (EITs) warrant attention as critical determinants for climate 
  change mitigation potential and related costs. These include current technological 
  development levels, technology transfer issues, capacity for innovation and 
  diffusion, barriers to efficient technology use, institutional structure, and 
  human capacity aspects. </p>
<p>Equity is another issue in evaluating mitigation policies. The use of income 
  weights is one approach to address equity. Under this system each dollar of 
  costs imposed on a person with low income is given greater weight relative to 
  the cost for a person with a high income. This method is, however, controversial 
  and it is difficult to obtain agreement on the weights to be used. An alternative 
  method is to report the distributional impacts separately. In this case it is 
  important that all the key stakeholders are identified and the distributional 
  effects on each reported. A third possibility is to use average damage estimates 
  and apply these to all those impacted, irrespective of their actual WTP. </p>
<p>Given these presumptions on structure, the costs of climate protection can 
  be modelled and assessed at three levels:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Project level analysis estimates costs using &#147;stand-alone&#148; investments 
    assumed to have minor secondary impacts on markets.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Sector level analysis estimates costs using a &#147;partial-equilibrium&#148; 
    model, in which other variables are presumed as given.</li>
  <li>Macroeconomic analysis estimates costs by considering how policies affect 
    all sectors and markets, using various macroeconomic and general equilibrium 
    models. The modeller confronts the trade-off between the level of detail in 
    the cost assessment and complexity of the system. For example, a macroeconomic 
    system tries to capture all direct and indirect impacts, with little detail 
    on the impacts of specific smaller scale projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modelling climate mitigation strategies can be done using several techniques, 
  including input&#150;output models, macroeconomic models, computable general 
  equilibrium models, and models based on the energy sector. Hybrid models have 
  also been developed to provide more detail on the structure of the economy and 
  the energy sector. Two broad classes of integrated assessment models can be 
  identified: policy optimization models and policy evaluation models. The appropriate 
  use of these models depends on the subject of the evaluation and the availability 
  of data.</p>
<p>Finally, the main categories of climate change mitigation policies include 
  market-oriented, technology-oriented, voluntary, and research and development 
  (R&amp;D) policies. Climate change mitigation policies can include elements 
  of two or more policy options. Economic models, for example, mainly assess market-oriented 
  policies and in some cases technology policies, primarily those related to energy 
  supply options. In contrast, engineering approaches mainly focus on supply and 
  demand-side technology policies. Both approaches are relatively weak in the 
  representation of R&amp;D policies. </p>
