<h3>5.4.3 Industry</h3>
<p>Under perfect market conditions, all additional needs for energy services are 
  provided by the lowest cost measures for increased energy supply or reduced 
  energy demand. There is considerable evidence that energy efficiency investments 
  that are lower in cost than the cost of marginal energy supply are not being 
  made in real markets, suggesting that market barriers exist. A study of the 
  industrial electric motor market in France has demonstrated the existence of 
  barriers arising from decision-making practices, within an environment characterized 
  by lack of information and split incentives (de Almeida, 1998). Barriers may 
  exist at various points in the diffusion process of measures to reduce energy 
  use and/or GHG emissions. The diffusion process depends on many factors such 
  as capital cost, operating cost savings, information availability, network connections, 
  imitation effects, and other factors (DeCanio and Laitner, 1997). All of these 
  factors influence the probability of a firm adopting a given technology at a 
  particular point in time. Barriers may take many forms in this process, and 
  should be reviewed in the context of the industrial and business environment 
  (e.g., multi-criteria optimization, firm size and structure, market structure, 
  opportunity, and information routes). While barriers exist, it is important 
  to note that ESTs and practices may also represent a strategic and competitive 
  advantage through the development of new markets or new market opportunities, 
  as shown by various authors (Porter and Van der Linde, 1995b; Reinhardt, 1999). 
  This section focuses on barriers and opportunities in the industrial sector, 
  and cites examples of successful approaches that have been used to remove barriers. 
</p>
<p><i>Decision-making Processes</i><b> </b><br>
  In firms, decision-making processes are a function of its rules of procedure, 
  business climate, corporate culture, managers&#146; personalities, and perception 
  of the firm&#146;s energy efficiency (DeCanio, 1993; OTA, 1993) and perceived 
  risks of the investment, stressing the importance of firm structure, organization, 
  and internal communication (Ramesohl, 1998). Energy awareness as a means to 
  reduce production costs seems not to be a high priority in many firms, despite 
  a number of excellent examples in industry worldwide. For example, Nelson (1994) 
  reports on a (discontinued) successful programme at a major chemical company 
  in the USA, which resulted in large energy savings with internal rates of return 
  of over 100%. However, such programmes are only reported in a relatively small 
  number of plants. A recent analysis of the Green Lights programme in the USA 
  demonstrated the shortcomings in traditional decision-making processes, as investments 
  in energy efficient lighting showed much higher paybacks than other investments. 
  (DeCanio, 1998). These analyses demonstrate the need for a better understanding 
  of the decision-making process, to be appropriately accounted in modelling and 
  policy development.</p>
<p><i>Lack of Information</i><br>
  Cost-effective energy efficiency measures are often not undertaken as a result 
  of lack of information on the part of the consumer, or a lack of confidence 
  in the information, or high transaction costs for obtaining reliable information 
  (Reddy, 1991; Sioshansi, 1991; OTA, 1993; Levine <i>et al</i>., 1995). Information 
  collection and processing consumes time and resources, which is especially difficult 
  for small firms (Gruber and Brand, 1991; Velthuijsen, 1995). In many developing 
  countries public capacity for information dissemination is especially lacking 
  (TERI, 1997). The information gap concerns not only consumers of end-use equipment 
  but all aspects of the market (Reddy, 1991). Many producers of end-use equipment 
  have little knowledge of ways to make their products energy efficient, nor access 
  to the technology for producing the improved products. Equipment suppliers may 
  also lack the information, or ways to assess, evaluate, or disseminate the information. 
  End-use providers are often unacquainted with efficient technology. In addition, 
  there is a focus on market and production expansion, which may be more effective 
  than efficiency improvements, to generate profit maximization. In the New Independent 
  States (NIS) firms are more directed towards increasing competitiveness, although 
  there are examples where firms have used energy efficiency as a means to reduce 
  production costs (Gritsevich, 2000). Also, a lack of adequate management tools, 
  techniques, and procedures to account for the economic benefits of efficiency 
  improvements is an information barrier (see below). Finally, other policies 
  and regulations may limit access to energy-efficient technologies. For example, 
  import regulations for specific projects and industries in China (Fisher-Vanden, 
  1998) and India (Schumacher and Sathaye, 1999) limited or imposed high levies 
  on the import of industrial technologies for some periods.</p>
<p><i>Limited Capital Availability</i><b> </b><br>
  Energy efficiency investments are made to compete with other investment priorities, 
  and many firms have high hurdle rates for energy efficiency investments because 
  of limited capital availability. Capital rationing is often used within firms 
  as an allocation means for investments, leading to even higher hurdle rates, 
  especially for small projects with rates of return from 35% to 60%, much higher 
  than the cost of capital (~15%) (Ross, 1986). In many developing countries cost 
  of capital for domestic enterprises is generally in the range of up to 30%-40%. 
  Especially for SMEs capital availability may be a major hurdle in investing 
  in energy efficiency improvement technologies because of limited access to banking 
  and financing mechanisms. When energy prices do not reflect the real costs of 
  energy (without subsidies or externalities) then consumers will necessarily 
  underinvest in energy efficiency. Energy prices, and hence the profitability 
  of an investment, are also subject to large fluctuations. The uncertainty about 
  the energy price, especially in the short term, seems to be an important barrier 
  (Velthuijsen, 1995). The uncertainties often lead to higher perceived risks, 
  and therefore to more stringent investment criteria and a higher hurdle rate. 
</p>
<p><i>Lack of Skilled Personnel</i><b> </b><br>
  A lack of skilled personnel, especially for SMEs, leads to difficulties installing 
  new energy-efficient equipment compared to the simplicity of buying energy (Reddy, 
  1991; Velthuijsen, 1995). In many firms (especially with the current development 
  toward &#147;lean&#148; firms) there is often a shortage of trained technical 
  personnel, as most personnel are busy maintaining production (OTA, 1993). In 
  most developing countries there is hardly any knowledge infrastructure available 
  that is easily accessible for SMEs. Also, the position within the company hierarchy 
  of energy or environmental managers may lead to less attention to energy efficiency, 
  and reduced availability of human resources to evaluate and implement new measures.</p>
