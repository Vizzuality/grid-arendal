<h2><a name="13"></a>1.3 Integrating the Various Perspectives </h2>
<p>Extending discussions of how nations might respond to the mitigation challenge 
  so that they include issues of cost-effectiveness and efficiency, distribution 
  narrowly defined, equity more broadly defined, and sustainability, adds enormous 
  complexity to the problem of uncovering how best to respond to the threat of 
  climate change. Indeed, recognizing that these multiple domains are relevant 
  complicates the task assigned to policymakers and international negotiators 
  by opening their deliberations to issues that lie beyond the boundaries of the 
  climate change problem, per se. Their recognition thereby underlines the importance 
  of integrating scientific thought across a wide range of new policy-relevant 
  contexts, but not simply because of some abstract academic or narrow parochial 
  interest advanced by a small set of researchers or nations. Cost-effectiveness, 
  equity, and sustainability have all been identified as critical issues by the 
  drafters of the UNFCCC, and they are an integral part of the charge given to 
  the drafters of the TAR. Integration across the domains of cost-effectiveness, 
  equity, and sustainability is therefore profoundly relevant to policy deliberations 
  according to the letter as well as the spirit of the UNFCCC itself. </p>
<p>The literature being brought to bear on climate change mitigation increasingly 
  shows that policies lying beyond simply reducing GHG emissions from a specified 
  baseline to minimize costs can be extremely effective in abating the emission 
  of GHGs. Therefore, a portfolio approach to policy and analysis would be more 
  effective than exclusive reliance on a narrow set of policy instruments or analytical 
  tools. Besides the flexibility that an expanded range of policy instruments 
  and analytical tools can provide to policymakers for achieving climate objectives, 
  the explicit inclusion of additional policy objectives also increases the likelihood 
  of &#147;buy-in&#148; to climate policies by more participants. In particular, 
  it will expand the range of no regrets<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' >2</a></sup></small> 
  options. Finally, it could assist in tailoring policies to short-, medium-, 
  and long-term goals.</p>
<p>In order to be effective, however, a portfolio approach requires weighing the 
  costs and impacts of the broader set of policies according to a longer list 
  of objectives. Climate deliberations need to consider the climate ramifications 
  of policies designed primarily to address a wide range of issues including DES, 
  as well as the likely impacts of climate policies on the achievement of these 
  objectives. As part of this process the opportunity costs and impacts of each 
  instrument are measured against the multiple criteria defined by these multiple 
  objectives. Furthermore, the number of decision makers or stakeholders to be 
  considered is increased beyond national policymakers and international negotiators 
  to include state, local, community, and household agents, as well as non-government 
  organizations (NGOs). </p>
<p>The term &#147;ancillary benefits&#148; is often used in the literature for 
  the ancillary, or secondary, effects of climate change mitigation policies on 
  problems other than GHG emissions, such as reductions in local and regional 
  air pollution, associated with the reduction of fossil fuels, and indirect effects 
  on issues such as transportation, agriculture, land use practices, biodiversity 
  preservation, employment, and fuel security. Sometimes these are referred to 
  as &#147;ancillary impacts&#148;, to reflect the fact that in some cases the 
  benefits may be negative<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' >3</a></sup></small>. 
  The concept of &#147;mitigative capacity&#148; is also introduced as a possible 
  way to integrate results derived from the application of the three perspectives 
  in the future. The determinants of the capacity to mitigate climate change include 
  the availability of technological and policy options, and access to resources 
  to underwrite undertaking those options. These determinants are the focus of 
  much of the TAR. The list of determinants is, however, longer than this. Mitigative 
  capacity also depends upon nation-specific characteristics that facilitate the 
  pursuit of sustainable development &#150; e.g., the distribution of resources, 
  the relative empowerment of various segments of the population, the credibility 
  of empowered decision makers, the degree to which climate objectives complement 
  other objectives, access to credible information and analyses, the will to act 
  on that information, the ability to spread risk intra- and inter-generationally, 
  and so on. Given that the determinants of mitigative capacity are essentially 
  the same as those of the analogous concept of adaptive capacity introduced in 
  the WGII Report, this approach may provide an integrated framework for assessing 
  both sets of options.</p>
