<h3>8.2.2 Domestic Policy Instruments and Net Mitigation Costs</h3>
<p>Tapping the technical abatement potentials requires setting up new incentive 
  structures (taxes, emissions trading, technical standards, voluntary agreements, 
  subsidies) for production and consumption, i.e. climate policies. In the following, 
  empirical models that measure net mitigation costs of climate policies are reviewed 
  in order to disentangle the reasons why certain policy packages have similar 
  or different outcomes in various countries. As a first step, the results are 
  presented at an aggregated level; then the impact of measures meant to mitigate 
  the sectoral and distributional consequences of climate policies is examined. 
  Finally, in a third step, the ancillary benefits from the joint reduction of 
  carbon emissions and other pollutants are considered to complete the picture.</p>
<h4><a name="8221"></a>8.2.2.1 Aggregate Assessment of Revenue-raising Instruments</h4>
<p>Introducing a carbon tax (or auctioned tradable permits) provides an incentive 
  to change the technology over the short and long term. Such policies generate 
  tax revenues and the way these revenues are used has major impacts on the social 
  costs of the climate policy. The reason is that these revenues are, in principle, 
  available to offset some or all of the costs of the mitigation policy. When 
  emission targets go beyond the negative cost potentials, there is a general 
  agreement among economists (see <a href="224.htm">Chapters 6</a> and <a href="266.htm">7</a>) 
  that if standards are used (or if emissions permits are allocated for free) 
  the resultant social cost is higher than the total abatement expenditures. Producers 
  pass part of the marginal abatement cost on to consumers through higher selling 
  prices, which implies a loss of consumer surplus. If the elasticity of supply 
  is quite high, this might lead to a net loss of producer surplus. However, if 
  the elasticity of supply is fairly low, overall (or net) producer surplus can 
  rise when policies cause a restriction in output, because the policy-generated 
  rents per unit of production enjoyed by producers more than compensate for the 
  net decrease in sales.</p>
<p>In the 1990s there was considerable interest in how revenue-neutral carbon 
  taxes may mitigate this effect on the economy by enabling the government to 
  cut the marginal rates of pre-existing taxes, such as income, payroll, and sales 
  taxes. The possibility is a double dividend policy (Pearce, 1992), by both (1) 
  improving the environment and (2) offsetting at least part of the welfare losses 
  of climate policies by reducing the costs of the tax system (see the discussion 
  in <a href="266.htm">Chapter 7</a>). The same mechanism occurs when nationally 
  auctioned permits are used; for simplicity, the term carbon tax is used in the 
  rest of this chapter, except when the distinction between these two instruments 
  is necessary.</p>
<p>The starting point in a discussion of a double dividend is how expensive it 
  is to raise government income, that is, how big is the marginal cost of funds 
  (MCF). A high MCF gives more scope for a double dividend than a small MCF in 
  the economy. This arises because the parameters that determine the magnitude 
  of the double-dividend (see <a href="266.htm">Chapter 7</a>) are:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>direct cost to the regulated sector (sector&#146;s changes in production 
    methods or installation of pollution-abatement equipment);<br>
  </li>
  <li>tax-interaction effect (prices are increasing); <br>
  </li>
  <li>revenue-recycling effect associated with using revenues to finance cuts 
    in marginal tax rates.<a name="fig8-3"></a></li>
</ul>

<p>When the revenues of carbon taxes are returned in a lump-sum fashion to households 
  and firms, the tax-interaction effect is systematically higher than the revenue-recycling 
  effect. Also the net cost of climate policy is higher than its gross cost (while 
  lower than that with a no-tax policy, see A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> in 
  <a href="#fig8-3">Figure 8.3</a>). However, it is possible to improve this result 
  by targetting tax revenues to cuts in the most distortionary taxes; this can 
  yield either a weak or a strong form of double dividend (Goulder, 1995a). The 
  weak double dividend occurs as long as there is a revenue-recycling effect due 
  to the swap between carbon taxes and the most distortionary taxes. Mitigation 
  costs are systematically lower when revenues are recycled this way than when 
  they are returned lump sum. The strong double dividend is more difficult to 
  obtain. It requires that the (beneficial) revenue-recycling effect more than 
  offset the combination of the primary cost and the tax-interaction effect. In 
  this case, the net cost of abatement is negative (at least within some range). 
  As discussed in <a href="266.htm">Chapter 7</a>, this is possible if, prior 
  to the introduction of the mitigation policy, the tax system is already highly 
  inefficient along non-environmental dimensions. In terms of <a href="#fig8-3">Figure 
  8.3</a>, the revenue-recycling effect is represented by the downward shift from 
  curve A<sub>1</sub> to curve A<sub>2</sub> or A<sub>3</sub>. If the shift is 
  from A<sub>1</sub> to A<sub>2</sub>, the weak double dividend occurs, but not 
  the strong double dividend. If the shift is from A<sub>1</sub> to A<sub>3</sub>, 
  not only does the weak double dividend occur, but the strong double dividend 
  is realized as well, since the net costs are negative within a range.</p>
<p>While the weak form of double dividend enjoys broad support from theoretical 
  and numerical studies, the strong double dividend hypothesis is less broadly 
  supported and more controversial. Indeed, reaching an economical dividend is 
  impossible when the economy is at full employment and if all other taxation 
  is optimal (abstracting for the environmental externality). Therefore, it may 
  be argued that the double dividend accrues from the tax reform, independently 
  of the climate policy. However, empirical models capture the fact that, in the 
  real world, a carbon tax or auctioned emissions permits will not be implemented 
  after the enforcement of an optimal fiscal reform. To the contrary, introducing 
  a new tax may be a <i>sine qua non </i>condition to the fiscal reform. For a 
  given carbon tax revenue, models help interpret the best way to recycle this 
  revenue.</p>
<p>Specific features of the tax systems and markets of the production factors 
  (labour, capital, and energy) ultimately determine the presence or absence of 
  a strong double dividend. For example, a double dividend is likely if production 
  factors are very distorted by prior taxation or specific market conditions, 
  if there is a problem of trade-balance because of the import of fossil energy, 
  or if consumer choice is highly distorted because of tax-deducible spending 
  provisions (Parry and Bento, 2000). <br>
</p>
<p>Empirical studies try to gauge the impact of these many determinants and to 
  understand why the effects of a given recycling strategy (reducing payroll, 
  personal income, corporate income, investment income, or expenditure taxes) 
  differ from one country to another.</p>
