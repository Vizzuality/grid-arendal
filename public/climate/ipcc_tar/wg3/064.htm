<h2><a name="15"></a>1.5 Integrating Across the Essential Domains&#150;Cost-effectiveness, 
  Equity, and Sustainability </h2>
<p>To include issues of cost-effectiveness, distribution (narrowly defined), equity 
  (more broadly defined), and sustainability adds enormous complexity to discussions 
  on the problem of how nations can respond best to the threat of climate change. 
  Indeed, recognition that these multiple domains are relevant complicates the 
  task assigned to policymakers and international negotiators by opening their 
  deliberations to issues that lie beyond the boundaries of the climate change 
  problem, per se. Their recognition thereby underscores the need to integrate 
  scientific thought across a wide range of new policy-relevant contexts, but 
  not simply because of some abstract academic or narrow parochial interest advanced 
  by a small set of researchers or nations. Cost-effectiveness, equity, and sustainability 
  have all been identified as critical issues by the crafters of the UNFCCC, and 
  they are an integral part of the charge given to the drafters of TAR. Integration 
  across the domains of cost-effectiveness, equity, and sustainability is therefore 
  profoundly relevant to policy deliberations according to the letter as well 
  as the spirit of the Framework Convention itself.</p>
<p>One important preliminary step towards integration of the three perspectives 
  that is developed in the body of this report is the use of ancillary and co-benefits, 
  developed and assessed most fully in <a href="266.htm">Chapters 7</a> and 
  <a href="319.htm">8</a> and referred to in many of the other chapters, that 
  could be used to augment mitigation cost estimates produced by the cost-effectiveness 
  approach. Thus, one could add or subtract an estimate of the equivalent cost 
  or benefits on various equity or sustainability metrics (e.g., changes in the 
  extent of poverty, human capital development, etc.) that would result from specific 
  mitigation policies. Although this would be a start on a more integrated quantitative 
  assessment of costs, it would initiate a debate on how these other metrics ought 
  to be evaluated and aggregated. This may make it desirable to move to a broader 
  integrating framework where multiple policies could be evaluated according to 
  multiple metrics simultaneously. The development of the concept of &#147;mitigative 
  capacity&#148; is one new, but promising, step towards the development of the 
  systematic evaluation of mitigation options from an integrated cost-effectiveness, 
  equity, sustainability perspective. </p>
<p>Yohe (2001, in press) has recently introduced mitigative capacity as an organizing 
  tool to aid policymakers and analysts alike as they try to accomplish this integration. 
  Briefly defined, a nation&#146;s mitigative capacity reflects its ability to 
  diminish the intensity of the natural (and other) stresses to which it might 
  be exposed. The list of stresses for any particular nation might include climate 
  change and climate variability, of course. It follows that to review the diversity 
  of the determinants of mitigative capacity from a climate perspective can help 
  assessors who contribute to IPCC Assessments and researchers who will look to 
  their report for guidance in setting their research agendas. These determinants 
  can, in short, provide a framework upon which to build and through which to 
  assess systematic and comparable representations of nations&#146; relative capacities 
  to cope. Mitigative capacity is therefore offered here as one means with which 
  to integrate and to evaluate the complex issues that have emerged since the 
  publication of SAR. There may be other means to the same end, of course, but 
  a focus on mitigative capacity has the virtue of concentrating attention directly 
  on the problem at hand&#150;climate change mitigation. </p>
