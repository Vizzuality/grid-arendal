<h2>2.3.3 Summary of General Mitigation Scenario Review </h2>
<p>Many mitigation as well as stabilization scenarios have already been quantified 
  and published. Most assume very simple policy options for their mitigation scenarios, 
  and only some of them have detailed policy packages. These policy options have 
  a very wide range in their level, which is apparently caused by the divergent 
  baseline scenarios and GHG reduction targets, with other factors such as differences 
  in models and reduction time-paths also acting to increase the range. Allocations 
  of emission reductions between OECD and non-OECD countries also vary widely, 
  and are affected by policy assumptions and model structures.</p>
<p>The mitigation scenarios under review were quantified based on a wide range 
  of baselines that reflect a diversity of assumptions, mainly with respect to 
  economic growth and low-carbon energy supply. The range of future trends shows 
  greater divergence in scenarios that focus on developing countries than in scenarios 
  that consider developed nations. There is little consensus with respect to future 
  directions among the existing disaggregated scenarios in developing regions.</p>
<p>Some general conclusions about the relationships between baseline scenarios 
  and mitigation policies are suggested by this review: an assumption of high 
  economic growth in the baseline tends to be associated with more technological 
  progress; the additional improvement of energy efficiency in mitigation scenarios 
  tends to be lower when the energy efficiency improvement is high in the base 
  case; and baseline scenarios with high carbon intensity reductions lead to mitigation 
  scenarios with relatively more carbon intensity reduction. The counterintuitive 
  nature of some of these conclusions suggests that the relationship between economic 
  growth and the macroeconomic cost of emission reduction is very complicated.</p>
<p>Most generally, it is clear that mitigation scenarios and mitigation policies 
  are strongly related to their baseline scenarios, but no systematic analysis 
  has been published on the relationship between mitigation and baseline scenarios.</p>
