<h4>9.4.2.7 Treatment of Environmental Damages<br>
</h4>
<p>Most models are not able to incorporate the benefits of preventing climate 
  change (or of the costs of doing nothing). Instead, modellers have only considered 
  the economic impact of meeting some emission standard, which implicitly assumes 
  (in the base situation) that climate change would have no economic impacts. 
  Nevertheless, the potential costs caused by climate change are likely to be 
  huge (even though some favourable effects are also expected) regarding: loss 
  of human well-being, damage to property including agriculture and forestry, 
  ecosystem loss, and risk of disaster, see Nordhaus (1991), Cline (1992, Chapter 
  3), Fankhauser (1995), Fankhauser and Tol (1995). This situation has been caused 
  to some extent by two factors, the difficulties of economists in valuing environmental 
  impacts, and the scientific uncertainty of predicting the physical effects of 
  climate change<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#13","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>13</sup></small></a>.</p>
<h4><a name="9428"></a>9.4.2.8 Recycling of Tax Revenues</h4>
<p>Carbon taxes will generate significant tax revenues. The effects of these revenues 
  in the economy will depend on how this money is recycled into the economy (in 
  practical terms, some mechanism for recycling is always needed in order to avoid 
  a general deflationary impact). If it is assumed that revenues will not be fully 
  recycled, the models tend to find that any carbon tax will reduce GDP. Usually, 
  modellers have tried to separate the economic impacts arising from this environmental 
  policy from those arising from a tax cut, assuming that revenues will be returned 
  in the form of lump-sum rebates (an unrealistic assumption). The alternative 
  is to assume that revenues collected from the carbon tax are used in correcting 
  economic distortions in the economy, e.g., taxation of employment, which would 
  benefit society not only by correcting the externality but also by reducing 
  the costs of the distorting taxes (the so-called &#147;double dividend&#148;). 
  Obviously, if the benefits from reducing existing taxes on labour are incorporated 
  into the modelling, the projected economic impacts can be substantially more 
  optimistic than if a lump-sum revenue recycling is assumed, although the size 
  of the effect depends on model specification<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#14","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>14</sup></small></a>.<br>
</p>
<h4> <a name="9429"></a>9.4.2.9 International Environmental Policy</h4>
<p>Environmental policy to reduce climate change will be economically efficient 
  when the incremental cost of emission reductions is equal in all complying countries. 
  A way of achieving cost savings in the abatement policy is to allow emission 
  sources to contract with each other to meet required emission reductions. In 
  this sense, flexible instruments such as international emissions trading and 
  JI are more efficient than a situation in which each country has to achieve 
  its own emission reduction<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#15","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>15</sup></small></a>. 
  Usually, international emissions trading is modelled as if all countries set 
  the same carbon tax rate, so that cost-effective emission reductions are advantageous 
  to undertake in whatever country they arise. Hence, if models consider economic 
  instruments for environmental regulation, the overall cost of controlling emissions 
  should be lower as a consequence of cost savings in the control produced by 
  these instruments<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#16","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>16</sup></small></a>.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that this kind of modelling implicitly assumes 
  an ideal scenario. However, in practice some problems arise with the basic theory, 
  involving the operation and design of the market. Some important considerations 
  here are: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the degree of competition in the market (i.e., that neither buyers nor sellers 
    have sufficient weight to influence the price of the permit);</li>
  <li>high transaction costs derived from inadequate information;</li>
  <li>airness in allocating the emission permits (auctioning versus &#147;grandfathering&#148;); 
    and </li>
  <li>the institutional and administrative costs of implementing the system (are 
    the costs negligible?)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#17","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>17</sup></small></a>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
