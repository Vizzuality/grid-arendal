<h4>9.2.8.4 Co-benefits from Reduced Road Traffic<br>
</h4>
<p>Nations may choose to include GHG mitigation along with improvements in urban 
  air quality and other traffic-related damages as objectives for policies designed 
  specifically to reduce road traffic. The policies have co-benefits in terms 
  of: </p>
<ul>
  <li>reduced air emissions associated with less fuel use (e.g., Ross, 1999), 
    and therefore consequent reductions in the damages caused by these emissions;</li>
  <li>reduced congestion;</li>
  <li>fewer traffic crashes;</li>
  <li>less noise; and </li>
  <li>less road damage. </li>
</ul>
<p>The co-benefits from less noise and road damage are only likely to be large 
  for substantial levels of mitigation (see ECMT, 1998 for valuations of these 
  benefits for some European countries).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="92841"></a>9.2.8.4.1 Air Pollution Associated with Road Traffic </h4>
<p>There are likely to be substantial GHG co-benefits from some policies mainly 
  aimed at reducing air pollution; these are mostly considered in <a href="319.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>. <br>
  <br>
  Today 3 out of 4 of the world&#146;s highly dense megacities are in the rapidly 
  developing countries, where traffic congestion is often high, involving highly 
  polluting and inefficient vehicle fleets (WRR, 1998). Because of this, reducing 
  traffic and congestion will also lower potential exposures to known hazards 
  from the burning of road fuels, especially to those living near to congested 
  roadways. Children are at high risk from the damaging neurological effects of 
  pollution. A recent report from the WHO and the European Environment Agency 
  estimates that 21,000 deaths annually are tied with air pollution from traffic 
  in Central Europe (WHO, 1999).<br>
</p>
<p>The total of health damage costs from road traffic is significant. A recent 
  study jointly produced by agencies of the Swiss, French and Austrian ministries 
  of health, environment, and economy estimates that the annual number of deaths 
  linked to traffic based pollution in these countries exceeds those that occur 
  because of traffic crashes alone. This study uses a willingness-to-pay approach 
  to economically evaluate traffic-related air pollution health effects. In all 
  three countries, the total air pollution related health costs are US$49.7bn<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#9","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>9</sup></small></a>, 
  with $26.7bn coming from road traffic-related pollution. As a percentage of 
  GDP, such costs in these countries range from 1.1%-5.8% (Sommer <i>et al</i>., 1999). 
  A recent study from Sao Paulo (Miraglia <i>et al</i>., forthcoming), estimated that 
  by 2020, 35300 avoidable deaths from air pollution will occur if current trends 
  in transportation continue and about 150,000 children will be admitted to the 
  hospital or visit the emergency room. <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="92842"></a>9.2.8.4.2 Road Congestion</h4>
<p>The research done on the ancillary benefits of GHG mitigation policies on road 
  transport suggests that the value of the consequent reduction in congestion 
  may be one of the most significant of such benefits (Barker <i>et al</i>., 1993). Traffic 
  congestion also contributes to increased exposure to pollutants by passengers 
  during periods of congestion, with levels inside private vehicles found to be 
  2 to 8 times those in the surrounding air (Fernandez-Bremauntz and Ashmore, 
  1995). Action to reduce this congestion can be expected to lower risks associated 
  with such exposures, as well as lessen public health impacts of associated pollutants 
  more generally.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="92843"></a>9.2.8.4.3 Road Traffic Crashes</h4>
<p><a href="369.htm">Section 9.2.8.2</a> lists several options for transport policies 
  to mitigate GHGs. Some of these options, such as expanded reliance on mass transit 
  and shifts away from individual passenger vehicles, can be expected to decrease 
  the number of traffic crashes. The total number of damages resulting from crashes 
  is substantial. With respect to traffic deaths and disabilities, the World Bank 
  reports that traffic crashes are already the leading cause of death for young 
  males and the 5th leading cause of death for young females worldwide. About 
  75% of all deaths occur in developing countries, although they have less than 
  1/4 of all vehicles. If present trends continue to 2020, one fourth of all health 
  costs in developing countries may be spent on treating road injuries alone (Ross, 
  1999). However, policies that encourage the use of smaller vehicles could have 
  increased death and injuries caused by traffic crashes (Dowlatabadi <i>et al</i>., 
  1996).</p>
<p>The extent to which these total damages may be affected by various climate 
  policies remains unknown, but is likely to be nontrivial and to vary in developed 
  and developing countries. For instance, shifting travel from personal vehicles 
  to mass transportation for large populations in the megacities of Sao Paulo 
  and Shanghai (MacKenzie, 1997) has been projected to yield two sets of ancillary 
  benefits:</p>
<ol>
  <li>less net GHG emissions from transport, and</li>
  <li>lower incidence of traffic-accident-related morbidity and mortality.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
