<h3>6.3.5 International Climate Change Agreements: Participation, Compliance, 
  and Liability </h3>
<h4><a name="6351"></a>6.3.5.1 Participation</h4>
<p>One of the concerns in the economics literature on environmental agreements 
  (including the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol) has been with increasing participation. 
  The most obvious way in which international agreements seek to increase participation 
  is by means of a minimum participation clause. This is an article that specifies 
  the agreement will not be binding on any of its Parties until a large enough 
  number of countries&#150;and, sometimes, particular countries or types of countries&#150;have 
  ratified the agreement. The minimum participation clause effectively makes the 
  obligations of each of its signatories a (non-linear) function of the total 
  number of signatories.</p>
<p>The minimum participation clause can serve as a strategic device, but this 
  need not always be the case. Suppose that the minimum participation level is 
  given as k+. Then, if the actual number of signatories is k, and k &lt; k+ &#150; 
  1, accession by a non-signatory neither costs this country anything nor confers 
  upon it any advantage. This is because the agreement would not yet be binding 
  on this country. However, if k = k+ &#150; 1, then accession has a non-marginal 
  effect on the environmental problem, for the accession will mean that all of 
  the k+ countries must undertake the measures prescribed by the treaty. One way 
  to sustain full co-operation would be to set k+ equal to the total number of 
  countries affected by an environmental problem (i.e., all countries), while 
  ensuring that every potentially participating country is better off with the 
  agreement than without it. Obviously, the threat not to undertake any abatement 
  for a smaller value of k can be an important incentive for countries that consider 
  joining the agreement to actually do so (because they believe that free-riding 
  doesn&#146;t pay). It is therefore extremely important that this threat be credible. 
  However, in the vast majority of cases it will not be (Hoel, 1993; Carraro and 
  Siniscalco, 1993; Barrett, 1994).</p>
<p>More importantly, the actual number of Parties to an agreement usually exceeds 
  the minimum participation level, which is another reason why the above threat 
  mechanism cannot be used to deter free-riding. The minimum participation level 
  clause may rather serve as a co-ordinating device than as an actual incentive 
  to join the agreement.</p>
<p>The point, however, is that while agreements must offer some alternative means 
  for deterring free-riding, often they do not. The literature on international 
  environmental agreements therefore predicts that participation will be incomplete, 
  and it often is. One of the few agreements that disproves this general rule 
  is the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete the ozone layer (UNEP, 
  1987; revised and amended in 1990 and 1992). The revised Protocol contains provisions 
  that control trade between Parties and non-Parties to the regime. Coupled with 
  the financial resources available to developing countries Parties that are not 
  available to non-Parties, the Party&#150;non-Party trade provisions are widely 
  cited as a major factor in explaining the near universal participation in the 
  ozone regime (Rowlands, 1995). See also <a href="379.htm">Chapter 10</a> 
  for a further discussion on participation in international regimes.</p>
