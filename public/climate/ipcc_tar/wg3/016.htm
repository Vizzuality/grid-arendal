<h1><a name="25"></a>2.5 Review of Post-SRES Mitigation Scenarios</h1>
<p>Recognizing the importance of multiple baselines in evaluating mitigation strategies, 
  recent studies analyze and compare mitigation scenarios using as their baselines 
  the new SRES scenarios. This allows for the assessment in this report of 76 
  &#147;post-SRES mitigation scenarios&#148; produced by nine modelling teams. 
  These mitigation scenarios were quantified on the basis of storylines for each 
  of the six SRES scenarios that describe the relationship between the kind of 
  future world and the capacity for mitigation.</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" align="right">
  <tr>

      <p><b>Figure TS.2</b>: Comparison of reference and stabilization scenarios. 
        The figure is divided into six parts, one for each of the reference scenario 
        groups from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). Each part 
        of the figure shows the range of total global CO2 emissions (gigatonnes 
        of carbon (GtC)) from all anthropogenic sources for the SRES reference 
        scenario group (shaded in grey) and the ranges for the various mitigation 
        scenarios assessed in the TAR leading to stabilization of CO2 concentrations 
        at various levels (shaded in colour). Scenarios are presented for the 
        A1 family subdivided into three groups (the balanced A1B group (Figure 
        TS-2a), non-fossil fuel A1T (Figure TS-2b), and the fossil intensive A1FI 
        (Figure TS-2c)) and stabilization of CO2 concentrations at 450, 550, 650 
        and 750ppmv; for the A2 group with stabilization at 550 and 750ppmv in 
        Figure TS-2d, the B1 group and stabilization at 450 and 550ppmv in Figure 
        TS-2e, and the B2 group including stabilization at 450, 550, and 650ppmv 
        in Figure TS-2f. The literature is not available to assess 1000ppmv stabilization 
        scenarios. The figure illustrates that the lower the stabilization level 
        and the higher the baseline emissions, the wider the gap. The difference 
        between emissions in different scenario groups can be as large as the 
        gap between reference and stabilization scenarios within one scenario 
        group. The dotted lines depict the boundaries of the ranges where they 
        overlap (see <a href="015.htm#boxTS1">Box TS.1</a>).</p>

<p><a name="figTS2"></a>Quantifications differ with respect to the baseline scenario, 
  including assumed storyline, the stabilization target, and the model that was 
  used. The post-SRES scenarios cover a very wide range of emission trajectories, 
  but the range is clearly below the SRES range. All scenarios show an increase 
  in CO<sub>2</sub> reduction over time. Energy reduction shows a much wider range 
  than CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, because in many scenarios a decoupling between 
  energy use and carbon emissions takes place as a result of a shift in primary 
  energy sources.</p>
<p>In general, the lower the stabilization target and the higher the level of 
  baseline emissions, the larger the CO<sub>2</sub> divergence from the baseline 
  that is needed, and the earlier that it must occur. The A1FI, A1B, and A2 worlds 
  require a wider range of and more strongly implemented technology and/or policy 
  measures than A1T, B1, and B2. The 450 ppmv stabilization case requires more 
  drastic emission reduction to occur earlier than under the 650 ppmv case, with 
  very rapid emission reduction over the next 20 to 30 years (see <a href="#figTS2">Figure 
  TS.2</a>).</p>
<p>A key policy question is what kind of emission reductions in the medium term 
  (after the Kyoto Protocol commitment period) would be needed. Analysis of the 
  post-SRES scenarios (most of which assume developing country emissions to be 
  below baselines by 2020) suggests that stabilization at 450 ppmv will require 
  emissions reductions in Annex I countries after 2012 that go significantly beyond 
  their Kyoto Protocol commitments. It also suggests that it would not be necessary 
  to go much beyond the Kyoto commitments for Annex I by 2020 to achieve stabilization 
  at 550 ppmv or higher. However, it should be recognized that several scenarios 
  indicate the need for significant Annex I emission reductions by 2020 and that 
  none of the scenarios introduces other constraints such as a limit to the rate 
  of temperature change.</p>
<p>An important policy question already mentioned concerns the participation of 
  developing countries in emission mitigation. A preliminary finding of the post-SRES 
  scenario analysis is that, if it is assumed that the CO<sub>2</sub> emission 
  reduction needed for stabilization occurs in Annex I countries only, Annex I 
  per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would fall below non-Annex I per capita 
  emissions during the 21st century in nearly all of the stabilization scenarios, 
  and before 2050 in two-thirds of the scenarios, if developing countries emissions 
  follow the baseline scenarios. This suggests that the stabilization target and 
  the baseline emission level are both important determinants of the timing when 
  developing countries emissions might need to diverge from their baseline. </p>
<p>Climate policy would reduce per capita final energy use in the economy-emphasized 
  worlds (A1FI, A1B, and A2), but not in the environment-emphasized worlds (B1 
  and B2). The reduction in energy use caused by climate policies would be larger 
  in Annex I than in non-Annex I countries. However, the impact of climate policies 
  on equity in per capita final energy use would be much smaller than that of 
  the future development path. </p>
<p>There is no single path to a low emission future and countries and regions 
  will have to choose their own path. Most model results indicate that known technological 
  options<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#5","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>5</a></sup></small> 
  could achieve a broad range of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> stabilization levels, 
  such as 550 ppmv, 450 ppmv or, below over the next 100 years or more, but implementation 
  would require associated socio-economic and institutional changes.<br>
  <br>
  Assumed mitigation options differ among scenarios and are strongly dependent 
  on the model structure. However, common features of mitigation scenarios include 
  large and continuous energy efficiency improvements and afforestation as well 
  as low-carbon energy, especially biomass over the next 100 years and natural 
  gas in the first half of the 21st century. Energy conservation and reforestation 
  are reasonable first steps, but innovative supply-side technologies will eventually 
  be required. Possible robust options include using natural gas and combined-cycle 
  technology to bridge the transition to more advanced fossil fuel and zero-carbon 
  technologies, such as hydrogen fuel cells. Solar energy as well as either nuclear 
  energy or carbon removal and storage would become increasingly important for 
  a higher emission world or lower stabilization target.</p>
<p>Integration between global climate policies and domestic air pollution abatement 
  policies could effectively reduce GHG emissions in developing regions for the 
  next two or three decades. However, control of sulphur emissions could amplify 
  possible climate change, and partial trade-offs are likely to persist for environmental 
  policies in the medium term.</p>
<p>Policies governing agriculture, land use and energy systems could be linked 
  for climate change mitigation. Supply of biomass energy as well as biological 
  CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration would broaden the available options for carbon 
  emission reductions, although the post-SRES scenarios show that they cannot 
  provide the bulk of the emission reductions required. That has to come from 
  other options.</p>
