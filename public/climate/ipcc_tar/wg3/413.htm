<h4>10.3.2.3 Choices and Decisions Related to Lifestyles </h4>
<p>There are two reasons why lifestyles are an issue of climate policy. First, 
  consumption patterns are an important factor in climate change since they have 
  become an essential element of lifestyles in developed countries. If, for instance, 
  people changed their preferences from cars to bicycles, this would alleviate 
  climate change and decrease mitigation costs considerably. Second, many promising 
  domains for substantial environmental improvements through technological change 
  also require changes in lifestyle. With respect to traffic, for instance, to 
  reach sustainability beyond that of increases in efficiency requires changes 
  in the modal split and ultimately in urban planning (Deutscher Bundestag, 1994). 
  Yet lifestyles have been subjected to far less systematic investigation than 
  technology (Duchin, 1998, p. 51). In SAR they were not discussed at all.</p>
<p>The concept of lifestyle (<i>Lebensf&uuml;hrung</i>) was introduced by Weber 
  (1922). Lifestyle denotes a set of basic attitudes, values, and patterns of 
  behaviour that are common to a social group, including patterns of consumption 
  or anticonsumption. It seemed for a while that a change from environmentally 
  less benign to more benign consumption patterns had emerged by itself (Inglehart, 
  1971, 1977) in the 1970s. What really happened, however, was not a switch from 
  one coherent and dominant set of values to another, but an end of coherence 
  through a pluralization of values (Mitchell, 1983; Reusswig, 1994; Douglas <i>et 
  al</i>., 1998). Current lifestyles reflect this patchwork of values. Some of 
  these, however, are environmentally more benign than others. The idea of promoting 
  transfers from the latter to the former must take into account that lifestyles 
  are not just a matter of behaving this or that way, but are basically an expression 
  of people&#146;s self-esteem (see below). Lifestyles, therefore, are based on 
  ideas with respect to the individual&#146;s identity. To this extent the issue 
  is not only that individuals need to change their behaviour, but that they need 
  to change themselves. This tends to be underestimated in policy considerations, 
  but must be accounted for when such changes become relevant with respect to 
  climate change. Otherwise discrepancies between people&#146;s environmental 
  consciousness and behaviour are deplored but not understood.</p>
