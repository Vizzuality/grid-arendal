<h2>Ways and Means for Mitigation </h2>
<a name="17"></a>17. <i>The successful implementation of greenhouse gas mitigation 
options needs to overcome many technical, economic, political, cultural, social, 
behavioural and/or institutional barriers which prevent the full exploitation 
of the technological, economic and social opportunities of these mitigation options</i>. 
The potential mitigation opportunities and types of barriers vary by region and 
sector, and over time. This is caused by the wide variation in mitigation capacity. 
The poor in any country are faced with limited opportunities to adopt technologies 
or change their social behaviour, particularly if they are not part of a cash 
economy, and most countries could benefit from innovative financing and institutional 
reform and removing barriers to trade. In the industrialized countries, future 
opportunities lie primarily in removing social and behavioural barriers; in countries 
with economies in transition, in price rationalization; and in developing countries, 
in price rationalization, increased access to data and information, availability 
of advanced technologies, financial resources, and training and capacity building. 
Opportunities for any given country, however, might be found in the removal of 
any combination of barriers (Sections <a href="064.htm">1.5</a>, <a href="185.htm">5.3</a>, 
<a href="205.htm">5.4</a>). <br>
<br>
<a name="18"></a>18. <i>National responses to climate change can be more effective 
if deployed as a portfolio of policy instruments to limit or reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions</i>. The portfolio of national climate policy instruments may include 
- according to national circumstances - emissions/carbon/energy taxes, tradable 
or non-tradable permits, provision and/or removal of subsidies, deposit/refund 
systems, technology or performance standards, energy mix requirements, product 
bans, voluntary agreements, government spending and investment, and support for 
research and development. Each government may apply different evaluation criteria, 
which may lead to different portfolios of instruments. The literature in general 
gives no preference for any particular policy instrument. Market based instruments 
may be cost-effective in many cases, especially where capacity to administer them 
is developed. Energy efficiency standards and performance regulations are widely 
used, and may be effective in many countries, and sometimes precede market based 
instruments. Voluntary agreements have recently been used more frequently, sometimes 
preceding the introduction of more stringent measures. Information campaigns, 
environmental labelling, and green marketing, alone or in combination with incentive 
subsidies, are increasingly emphasized to inform and shape consumer or producer 
behaviour. Government and/or privately supported research and development is important 
in advancing the long-term application and transfer of mitigation technologies 
beyond the current market or economic potential (<a href="231.htm">Section 6.2</a>). 
<p><a name="19"></a>19.<i> The effectiveness of climate change mitigation can 
  be enhanced when climate policies are integrated with the non-climate objectives 
  of national and sectorial policy development and be turned into broad transition 
  strategies to achieve the long-term social and technological changes required 
  by both sustainable development and climate change mitigation</i>. Just as climate 
  policies can yield ancillary benefits that improve wellbeing, non-climate policies 
  may produce climate benefits. It may be possible to significantly reduce greenhouse 
  gas emissions by pursuing climate objectives through general socio-economic 
  policies. In many countries, the carbon intensity of energy systems may vary 
  depending on broader programmmes for energy infrastructure development, pricing, 
  and tax policies. Adopting state-of-the-art environmentally sound technologies 
  may offer particular opportunity for environmentally sound development while 
  avoiding greenhouse gas intensive activities. Specific attention can foster 
  the transfer of those technologies to small and medium size enterprises. Moreover, 
  taking ancillary benefits into account in comprehensive national development 
  strategies can lower political and institutional barriers for climate-specific 
  actions (Sections <a href="072.htm#223">2.2.3</a>, <a href="079.htm#244">2.4.4</a>, 
  <a href="079.htm#245">2.4.5</a>, <a href="080.htm#251">2.5.1</a>, <a href="082.htm#252">2.5.2</a>, 
  <a href="410.htm">10.3.2</a>, <a href="427.htm">10.3.4</a>). </p>
<p><a name="20"></a>20. <i>Co-ordinated actions among countries and sectors may 
  help to reduce mitigation cost, address competitiveness concerns, potential 
  conflicts with international trade rules, and carbon leakage. A group of countries 
  that wants to limit its collective greenhouse gas emissions could agree to implement 
  well-designed international instruments</i>. Instruments assessed in this report 
  and being developed in the Kyoto Protocol are emissions trading; Joint Implementation 
  (JI); the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); other international instruments 
  also assessed in this report include co-ordinated or harmonized emission/carbon/energy 
  taxes; an emission/carbon/ energy tax; technology and product standards; voluntary 
  agreements with industries; direct transfers of financial resources and technology; 
  and co-ordinated creation of enabling environments such as reduction of fossil 
  fuel subsidies. Some of these have been considered only in some regions to date 
  (Sections <a href="246.htm">6.3</a>, <a href="257.htm">6.4.2</a>, <a href="403.htm">10.2.7</a>, 
  <a href="405.htm">10.2.8</a>).</p>
<p><a name="21"></a>21. <i>Climate change decision-making is essentially a sequential 
  process under general uncertainty</i>. The literature suggests that a prudent 
  risk management strategy requires a careful consideration of the consequences 
  (both environmental and economic), their likelihood and society&#146;s attitude 
  toward risk. The latter is likely to vary from country to country and perhaps 
  even from generation to generation. This report therefore confirms the SAR finding 
  that the value of better information about climate change processes and impacts 
  and society&#146;s responses to them is likely to be great. Decisions about 
  near-term climate policies are in the process of being made while the concentration 
  stabilization target is still being debated. The literature suggests a step-by-step 
  resolution aimed at stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations. This will also 
  involve balancing the risks of either insufficient or excessive action. The 
  relevant question is not &#147;what is the best course for the next 100 years&#148;, 
  but rather &#147;what is the best course for the near term given the expected 
  long-term climate change and accompanying uncertainties&#148; (<a href="439.htm">Section 
  10.4.3</a>).</p>
<p> <a name="22"></a>22. <i>This report confirms the finding in the SAR that earlier 
  actions, including a portfolio of emissions mitigation, technology development 
  and reduction of scientific uncertainty, increase flexibility in moving towards 
  stabilization of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. The desired 
  mix of options varies with time and place</i>. Economic modelling studies completed 
  since the SAR indicate that a gradual near-term transition from the world&#146;s 
  present energy system towards a less carbon-emitting economy minimizes costs 
  associated with premature retirement of existing capital stock. It also provides 
  time for technology development, and avoids premature lock-in to early versions 
  of rapidly developing low-emission technology. On the other hand, more rapid 
  near-term action would decrease environmental and human risks associated with 
  rapid climatic changes. </p>
<p>It would also stimulate more rapid deployment of existing low-emission technologies, 
  provide strong near-term incentives to future technological changes that may 
  help to avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive technologies, and allow for later 
  tightening of targets should that be deemed desirable in light of evolving scientific 
  understanding (Sections <a href="074.htm#232">2.3.2</a>, <a href="082.htm#252">2.5.2</a>, 
  <a href="346.htm#841">8.4.1</a>, <a href="433.htm">10.4.2</a>, <a href="439.htm">10.4.3</a>). 
</p>
<p><a name="23"></a>23.<i> There is an inter-relationship between the environmental 
  effectiveness of an international regime, the cost-effectiveness of climate 
  policies and the equity of the agreement</i>. Any international regime can be 
  designed in a way that enhances both its efficiency and its equity. The literature 
  assessed in this report on coalition formation in international regimes presents 
  different strategies that support these objectives, including how to make it 
  more attractive to join a regime through appropriate distribution of efforts 
  and provision of incentives. While analysis and negotiation often focus on reducing 
  system costs, the literature also recognizes that the development of an effective 
  regime on climate change must give attention to sustainable development and 
  non-economic issues (Sections <a href="056.htm">1.3</a>, <a href="396.htm">10.2</a>).</p>
