<h4>5.3.8.4 Social Structures and Identities </h4>
<p>Most of the perspectives discussed in the last section treat the individual 
  as a self-contained person with intrinsic motivations. While this is a dominant 
  assumption in modern Western societies, in many cultures, individuals are understood 
  primarily in relation to others, and behaviour is largely explained in terms 
  of the social context (Hofstede, 1980; Cousins, 1989; Markus and Kitayama, 1991; 
  Dittmar, 1992). In fact, the social and cultural context of the individual is 
  important in all societies. It contributes to individuals&#146; moral ideals 
  and identity, to their areas of empowerment or constraint, and to the options 
  they perceive to be open to them. Social and cultural influences are mediated 
  through the use of discourse and symbolism and through the actions of others. 
  Individuals often conform to the cultural norms of their community because of 
  their needs for safety, sense of belonging, love, and esteem.</p>
<p>Social structures help to shape consumption, for example, through the association 
  of objects and activities with status (Veblen, 1899; Hirsch, 1977) and class 
  (Bourdieu, 1979). Social structures also allow some individuals to influence 
  the consumption patterns of others. In many societies, women are mainly responsible 
  for purchasing food and clothing for other household members, while men are 
  more influential over large household expenditures (Grover <i>et al</i>., 1999). Individuals 
  within wider communities also influence each other&#146;s consumption patterns 
  and habits in a wide variety of ways, depending on the social structure and 
  their respective positions within it.</p>
<p>Much human behaviour can be understood as an expression of identity or self-definition 
  (Meyer-Abich, 1997). In modern consumer societies, consumption patterns in particular 
  are also used to establish and communicate identity. The combinations of goods 
  people purchase help to confirm to themselves and express to others their personalities 
  and values (Douglas and Isherwood, 1979; Tomlinson, 1990), their membership 
  of particular social groups or communities (Schor, 1998), and their relationship 
  to their social and physical environment (Dittmar, 1992).</p>
<p>Some of the consumption choices that have the greatest effect on GHG emissions, 
  such as car and house ownership and international travel, are also among the 
  most significant means of establishing personal identity and group membership 
  (Schor, 1998). Where such consumption patterns are closely connected to individual 
  and collective identities, they may be particularly difficult to change, although 
  the role of consumption in society is changing. </p>
<p>Some argue that, with urbanization, conspicuous consumption may have become 
  more important as a form of status display &#150; in small, close-knit communities 
  it is unnecessary because everybody knows each other (Kempton and Layne, 1994). 
  The status and group membership function of consumption has also been altered 
  with the spread of television. Some viewers experience emotional attachments 
  to TV characters as if they were real people; viewers also use the characters 
  and situations they see as reference points for their own lives, helping to 
  shape and reinforce their own values and identities (McQuail <i>et al</i>., 1972). 
  Those who watch a large amount of television increasingly compare themselves 
  with the portrayed lifestyles of the super-rich, resulting in higher desired 
  levels of consumption (Schor, 1998). While the media can pose a barrier to GHG 
  mitigation by reinforcing current trends towards more GHG-intensive lifestyles, 
  it may also offer opportunities. Raising awareness among media professionals 
  of the need for GHG mitigation and the role of the media in shaping lifestyles 
  and aspirations could be an effective way to encourage a wider cultural shift. 
  The role of the media in GHG mitigation will be discussed further in the next 
  section.</p>
<p>Ongoing developments in the media and communication technology could also generate 
  barriers and opportunities for GHG mitigation. Many scenarios have been painted 
  of the potential impacts of information and communication technology on society. 
  The growth of Internet usage and other interactive communication forms are widely 
  expected to stimulate economic development and technological innovation (Cairncross, 
  1997). However, they may also lead to increased social stratification, social 
  exclusion, and a decline in trust and social solidarity (or social capital) 
  (Castells, 1998). Such developments could have major implications for the feasibility 
  of responding collectively to threats such as climate change. Fukuyama (1999) 
  argues that, although social capital has declined in recent decades with the 
  development of the information society, similar declines occurred during previous 
  economic and technological upheavals and were followed by the creation of new 
  institutions, leading to new heights of morality and social solidarity. Cairncross 
  (1997) even suggests that free communication may lead to global peace. Slevin 
  (2000) points to the development of personal web pages as a new, versatile, 
  and sophisticated means of establishing personal identity. Inglehart (1990) 
  finds signs of the emergence of a new &#147;postmaterial&#148; culture that 
  emphasizes networking and communication rather than possessions. However, Castells 
  (1998) believes that more investment is needed in education and science if societies 
  are to reap social benefits from new information and communication technologies 
  and respond to environmental and other challenges.</p>
