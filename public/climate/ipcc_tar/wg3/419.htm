<p><a name="fig105"></a>Awareness of the complex system of interrelated cause-and-effect 
  chains among climate, biodiversity, desertification, water, and forestry has 
  been growing in recent years. Now it is widely recognized that global environmental 
  problems and the ability to meet human needs are linked through a set of physical, 
  chemical, and biological processes. Climate change, for example, alters the 
  global hydrological cycle, affects the boundaries and functioning of ecological 
  systems, and accelerates land degradation and desertification (<a href="#fig105">Figure 
  10.5</a>). These negative impacts in turn reinforce each other through feedback 
  loops, which results in a serious threat to land productivity, food supply, 
  fresh-water availability, and biological diversity, particularly in vulnerable 
  regions (Watson <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1998).</p>
<p>Global environmental problems are addressed by a range of individual instruments 
  and conventions&#151;UN Convention on Climate Change, Convention on Biological 
  Diversity, Convention to Combat Desertification, and Forestry Principles. Each 
  of the instruments focuses on a specific issue and has its own defined objectives 
  and commitments, with the exception of Forestry Principles, which has no binding 
  legal agreement. A great deal of interaction exists among the environmental 
  issues that these instruments address, and there is also a significant overlap 
  in the implementation of the instruments. They contain similar requirements 
  concerning (UNDP, 1997):</p>
<ul>
  <li>common, shared, or co-ordinated governmental and civil institutions to enact 
    the general objectives; <br>
  </li>
  <li>formulation of strategies and action plans as a framework for country-level 
    implementation; <br>
  </li>
  <li>collection of data and processing information; <br>
  </li>
  <li>new and strengthened capacities for both human resources and institutional 
    structures; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>reporting obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="420.htm#tab104">Table 10.4</a> summarizes the actions and commitments 
  of the parties under the different instruments. The requirements represent a 
  significant burden, especially on developing countries, in terms of human and 
  financial resources. <a href="420.htm#tab104">Table 10.4</a> illustrates the 
  wide scope for overlaps between the instruments and the risks that their implementation 
  will lead to a duplicative effort.</p>
<p>It is recognized (UNDP, 1997) that global conventions and instruments &#147;can 
  be more efficiently implemented through a greater understanding of the commonalities 
  and overlaps between them and a co-ordinated and harmonized approach to their 
  implementation at the local, national, and international levels. In other words, 
  creating synergy among the instruments and their requirements&#148;. Indeed, 
  linkages between instruments provide opportunities to implement them in a mutual-reinforcing 
  manner, avoiding duplication. At least three clusters of activities are likely 
  to gain advantage from potential synergies in implementing the conventions: 
  the development and strengthening of organizational structures, capacity-building 
  interventions, and data collection and information processing.</p>
<p>Implementing the conventions involves the participation of institutional structures 
  with different responsibilities and concerns, their policy agendas are generally 
  limited in scope, and frequently their immediate objectives diverge. Further, 
  environmental issues are in general broadly diffused through different government 
  agencies, endowed with uneven resources in terms of both authority and material 
  resources. This institutional fragmentation, especially in developing countries, 
  results in a lack of co-ordination and duplication of activities in areas where 
  common organizational procedures, flows of information, and a set of coherent 
  individual institutional actions are required for effective policy actions. 
  Reporting to the respective conferences of the parties, setting up appropriate 
  legislation, and formulation and periodical updating of national action plans 
  are stipulated in the conventions. These need to move towards convergence on 
  overlapping issues, seeking consensus, and agree on policy frameworks within 
  which the ultimate goals can be achieved with greater effectiveness. Therefore, 
  the opportunities for synergies can be exploited by enhancing and strengthening 
  linkage mechanisms between institutions, either at the implementation of specific 
  tasks or functions or through the creation of more formal and permanent links 
  between different actors. The types of linkage mechanisms that might be most 
  successful will depend on institutional, political, and economic factors in 
  each specific case.</p>
