<h3>3.6.4 New Technological Options and Social and Behavioural Issues</h3>
<a name="3641"></a> 
<h4>3.6.4.1 Uptake of Management Techniques</h4>
<p>These include use of conservation tillage techniques, improved soil, pasture, 
  and livestock management, paddy field management, careful use of nitrogenous 
  fertilizers, better tractor operation, and irrigation scheduling as outlined 
  in <a href="#tab327">Table 3.27</a>.</p>
<p>Crop production in heated greenhouses is particularly energy intensive, and 
  in many cases intended to satisfy luxury demands for vegetables grown out of 
  season or cut flowers (Japan Resources Association, 1994). A range of options 
  exist to reduce the energy inputs (CAE, 1996).</p>

      Greater chemical weed control may be required. Benefits need to be achieved 
      without reducing crop yields which is more likely under dry conditions as 
      a result of moisture conservation. Animal powered versions of conservation 
      tillage used in developing countries can also reduce the manual drudgery.

<h4>3.6.4.2 Uptake of New Technologies </h4>
<p>There is potential for improving yields of food, fibre, and energy crops yet 
  reducing inputs by using genetic selection or modification. Animals can also 
  be bred to convert feed more efficiently. Transgenetic technologies will be 
  difficult to implement unless publicly supported. Following careful scientific 
  research, including life cycle assessment analyses, and stringent government 
  controls over the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment, 
  then it may be possible that future agricultural production systems will involve 
  lower inputs of nutrients and energy. The extent of the uptake of such developments 
  will be largely based on assessments of risks, benefits, and public perceptions 
  and is hard to predict. </p>
<p>Options to increase soil carbon levels are given in <a href="#tab327">Table 
  3.27</a>. Emissions of soil carbon of around 0.2&#150;3tC/ha resulting from 
  cultivation can be reduced by using zero or minimum tillage techniques. However, 
  a reverse of land use activities would soon lose any accumulated soil carbon. 
  In Canada a group of 7 energy companies are paying farmers (through an insurance 
  company acting as an aggregator of credits), CAN$1.50&#150;13/ha/yr to change 
  to zero tillage so they can claim the resulting carbon credits for the effective 
  accumulation period (Ag Climate, 1999). The return to farmers depends on the 
  recruiting and support programme costs, scientific proof of higher carbon gains, 
  and the extent to which other on-farm carbon emission reduction activities are 
  implemented.</p>
