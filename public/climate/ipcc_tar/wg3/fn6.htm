  In keeping within the defined scope of Working Group III, policies and measures 
  that can be used to reduce the costs of adaptation to climate change are not 
  examined.</span><br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="2"></a>2</b> The ability of two or more Annex I Parties to form 
  a "bubble" under Article 4 of the Kyoto Protocol is sometimes classified as 
  one of the flexibility mechanisms as well. This mechanism allows a one time 
  redistribution of the emissions limitation commitments among the participants. 
  Since such a redistribution is strictly a political decision this mechanism 
  is not discussed here.<br>
  <br>
  <b> <a name="3"></a>3</b> Annex I Parties to the UNFCCC (as amended by decision 
  4/CP.3) include all 39 Parties (38 countries plus the European Economic Community) 
  listed in Annex B of the Protocol that will have quantified emissions limitation 
  or reduction commitments for the 2008 to 2012 commitment period, plus Turkey 
  and Belarus, which are Parties to the Convention but not listed in Annex B of 
  the Protocol. To be precise, one should refer to the commitments of Annex I 
  Parties listed in Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol. To avoid confusion, the term 
  Annex I countries is used throughout this chapter to refer to Annex I Parties 
  listed in Annex B of the Protocol; Turkey and Belarus are understood to be included 
  within this umbrella term, but not within the group of countries that will have 
  limitation commitments.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="4"></a>4</b> While an exhaustive review of in-country experiences 
  with policy instruments is beyond the scope of this chapter, other recent works 
  have focused on this issue (Panayotou, 1998; Huber <i>et al</i>., 1999; Speck, 1999; 
  Stavins, 2000).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="5"></a>5</b> What makes a tradable permit a market-based instrument 
  is the possibility of trading the permit, not the initial allocation of the 
  permits (unless such allocation is through auction). The SAR adopted the convention 
  of using "permits" for domestic trading systems and "quotas" for international 
  trading systems. This convention is followed throughout the chapter.<br>
  <b><a name="6"></a>6</b> Sometimes taxes are combined with subsidies, known 
  as "fee/rebate".<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="7"></a>7</b> A harmonized tax does not necessarily require countries 
  to impose a tax at the same rate, but to impose different rates across countries 
  would not be cost-effective.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="8"></a>8</b> That is, those countries that ratified the Convention, 
  186 countries as of September 2000.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="9"></a>9</b> The Plan of Action also includes work on the development 
  and transfer of technologies, the financial mechanism, implementation of Articles 
  4.8 and 4.9 of UNFCCC, and preparations for the first session of the CoP serving 
  as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. This involves, <i>inter 
  alia</i>, decisions on rules that govern sink enhancement activities under Articles 
  3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="10"></a>10</b> However, some concepts of "barriers" seem to imply 
  combinations of instruments and levels or degrees of implementation. For example, 
  if the problem is viewed as one of externalities, it is natural to use a tax 
  on the relevant externality, with the tax set equal to the marginal social damages 
  at the efficient level of control. On the other hand, although categories of 
  "potential" refer to targets (ends), categories of policy instruments refer 
  to the means of achieving those ends.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="11"></a>11</b> The choice of weights is strongly influenced by many 
  national and sector-level circumstances. These include government jurisdictional 
  structure (e.g., sharing of government powers at various levels); geographical 
  and climate profile (e.g., area size, regional weather patterns, heating degree 
  days and temperature distribution, annual temperature variations, climate variability, 
  latitude); economic setting (e.g., gross domestic product (GDP), GDP/capita, 
  and GDP by sector); international trade patterns, such as percentage of energy-intensive 
  exports; energy and natural resource base; demographics (e.g., population total 
  and distribution, growth rate); land use and/or spatial patterns (e.g., distances 
  driven/capita); industry and agriculture structure; building stock, and urban 
  structure (e.g., home sizes); and environmental and/or health patterns (e.g., 
  potential for highly variable climate change mitigation impacts across different 
  national regions and urban areas).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="12"></a>12</b> For a description of the main reforms implemented 
  in Latin America see Lora (1997) and for EITs see Chandler (2000).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="13"></a>13</b> Energy-output ratios discussed here require a caveat 
  about China's GDP statistics. China's energy consumption in 1997 and 1998 decreased 
  0.6% and 1.6%, respectively, and its energy intensity drastically declined 80% 
  from 1985 to 1998. Many analysts consider statistics on Chinese GDP to be speculative 
  (IEA, 1998b).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="14"></a>14</b> The major reasons for such growth were: a shift from 
  an energy-intensive industrial structure to an even more energy-intensive industrial 
  structure through maintaining the competitive advantages of energy and raw materials 
  production in parallel with a sharp reduction of production in less energy-intensive 
  industries; reduced share of production-related energy consumption at the expense 
  of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) related energy consumption; 
  reduced GDP, industrial production, and industrial energy consumption with the 
  background of a relatively stable energy consumption in the residential sector; 
  lack of control and metering devices; non-payment problem, which appeared partly 
  as a reaction to the sky-rocketing growth of energy prices; weak capital markets 
  and high interest rates to attract capital for energy-efficiency improvement 
  projects (see Bashmakov, 1998).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="15"></a>15</b> The percentage reduction in energy consumption was 
  calculated by adding the gross calorific value of the reductions of the different 
  fuels under consideration and expressing the sum as a percentage of total primary 
  energy supply (TPES). As the calculations in this study did not take into account 
  the refinery sector (a 5% reduction in gasoline use can amount to a reduction 
  in TPES of more than 5%), the number thus derived constitutes a lower bound 
  to the true reductions in energy consumption. Some country experts strongly 
  criticized the methodology and quantitative results of the study (Bashmakov, 
  2000).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="16"></a>16</b> In this regard the time element could be crucial. 
  In fact, during the time in which prices adjust, transport volumes may grow, 
  but growth may be retarded. Additional research is needed to establish these 
  findings.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="17"></a>17</b> Other sectors, including electricity generation, 
  mining, cement, agriculture, and forestry, can also involve significant GHG 
  emissions but benefit from subsidies that increase emissions.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="18"></a>18</b> An EU Directive on Natural Gas was adopted by the 
  European Council of Ministers in May 1998 after publication in mid-1998; member 
  states will have 2 years to implement the Directive.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="19"></a>19</b> While it led to reduced emissions in some countries, 
  such as the UK (Fowlie, 1999), it had the opposite effect in others, such as 
  Australia.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="20"></a>20</b> Another example is how liberalization of energy markets 
  can reduce mitigation costs, especially when permit trading is not allowed, 
  insofar as, for instance, electricity trade makes it easier to fulfil mitigation 
  commitments (see also Hauch, 1999).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="21"></a>21</b> In this regard, in Sweden the increase in carbon 
  intensity was more the result of the political choice to phase out some nuclear 
  power plants than of a link to the creation of an exchange. More generally, 
  it may well be that the long-term impact of the international power exchange 
  between Norway and Sweden will be that gas-fired power plants are added to the 
  Nordic electricity system, causing coal-fired generation to decline. For some 
  general information on the relationship between market deregulation and national 
  mitigation commitments, see also Baron and Hou (1998).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="22"></a>22</b> The DOE study incorporated policy proposals such 
  as increasing the renewable-energy portfolio standards (RPSs) and removing barriers 
  to the use of combined heat and power technologies where they are economical. 
  In response to calls from environmentalists to reduce the potential impacts 
  of restructuring the electricity industry, some countries initiated specific 
  policies aimed at increasing the role of renewable energy in the electricity 
  generation mix (Mitchell, 1995b, 1997; Wolsink, 1996; Wiser, 1997, 1999; Wiser 
  and Pickle, 1997; Novem, 1998; Haddad and Jefferis, 1999; Wiser <i>et al</i>., 1999).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="23"></a>23</b> See Mitchell (1995b); Weinberg (1995); Boyle (1996); 
  Lovins (1996); Nadel and Geller (1996); Owen (1996); Brown <i>et al</i>. (1998); Eyre 
  (1998); Patterson (1999).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="24"></a>24</b> There is no general agreement on terms by which regulatory 
  standards are classified. In the USA, technology standards are often called 
  command-and-control standards because they dictate particular technologies or 
  best practices that limit the range of compliant behaviours. In other nations, 
  command and control normally refers to all regulatory standards because they 
  command behaviour and control compliance therewith.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="25"></a>25</b> Mandatory standards are put in place by either specific 
  legislation or government regulation. See, for instance, the Comprehensive National 
  Energy Policy Act (USA, 1992), versus the Energy Conservation in Buildings Requirement 
  for Thermal Performance and Heat-Water-Power Supply (Moscow City Government, 
  1999).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="26"></a>26</b> In the USA in 1997 standards set for appliances are 
  estimated to cover 75% and 84% of primary and delivered energy, respectively, 
  in the residential sector. Similarly, it is estimated that standards covered 
  49% of both primary and delivered commercial energy use in 1997 (EIA, 1999).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="27"></a>27</b> Technological progress provides a basis for regular 
  updates of efficiency standards. In Russia, for instance, 1976 standards for 
  refrigerators were improved by 50% in the 1980s and then in 1991 by an additional 
  50%. As a result, energy consumption of new units decreased by a factor of three 
  (Bashmakov and Sorokina, 1996). The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, 
  and Air Conditioning Engineers updates its codes for residential and commercial 
  buildings on average every 10 years.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="28"></a>28</b> In France, successive building codes in the residential 
  sector alone have generated 75% of the total energy savings over past 20 years. 
  After building codes were set in 1974 they were made stricter in 1982, 1988, 
  and 1998 (IEA, 1996, p.38).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="29"></a>29</b> This also applies to current climate policy. Under 
  certain circumstances it is preferable to adopt a more intensive regulatory 
  standards phase by financing capacity building and hands-on-experience in the 
  flexible instruments for administrators in developing countries (Montero, 2000c). 
  The Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) pilot phase might be considered a step 
  in this direction.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="30"></a>30</b> Regulatory standards reverse the distributional effects 
  of efficient subsidies in that the incremental costs of regulation are borne 
  not by producers, but by the subsidy-financing tax base or those consumers who 
  must cross-subsidize the environmental goods (see <a href="242.htm">Section 
  6.2.2.6</a>).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="31"></a>31</b> Empirical work suggests that to focus on all six 
  gases of the Kyoto Protocol (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, 
  SF<sub>6</sub>, PFCs, HFCs) and not just the carbon content of fuels reduces 
  compliance costs substantially (Reilly <i>et al</i>., 1999).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="32"></a>32</b> This assumes that "carbon removal and disposal" strategies 
  (e.g., removing CO<sub>2</sub> from stack gases and sequestering them in geological 
  formations or land use change involving afforestation and reforestation) receive 
  payments equivalent to the tax rate per tonne CO<sub>2eq</sub> sequestered. 
  It also assumes that non-energy GHG emissions are also subject to the tax or 
  to policies for which the marginal abatement cost is equal to the tax rate.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="33"></a>33</b> One aspect that is also relevant is taxing net emissions 
  versus gross emissions. Land use changes are included in the Kyoto Protocol. 
  A national Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model in which emissions from 
  the use of timber and carbon accumulation in the forest are taken into account, 
  thus calculating net emissions, is given by Pohjola (1999). If net emissions 
  are taxed, Pohjola (1999) finds that the carbon tax needed to reduce net emissions 
  by the same amount as emissions from fossil fuels is significantly lower.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="34"></a>34</b> Energy taxes may be more efficient than taxes on 
  carbon alone if there are negative externalities unrelated to CO<sub>2</sub> 
  associated with the energy services delivered.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="35"></a>35</b> A 1997 OECD study (OECD, 1997d) suggests that the 
  evidence that more stringent environmental regulation is reflected in the pattern 
  of international trade in goods produced by traditionally polluting activities 
  is not yet clear. This conclusion could change, however, if energy taxation 
  or any comparable measure is introduced at a large scale.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="36"></a>36</b> HFCs and SF<sub>6</sub> are manufactured gases used 
  in a variety of applications and ultimately escape to the atmosphere. Limiting 
  sales of these gases in the country effectively limits the subsequent emissions. 
  Cost-effectiveness then requires that the prices of the regulated substances 
  rise to reflect the social marginal cost of abatement (see <a href="256.htm#641">Section 
  6.4.1</a>), so that the sources have the correct incentive to implement the 
  appropriate abatement measures.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="37"></a>37</b> Virtually all of the carbon content of fossil fuels 
  is converted to CO<sub>2</sub> upon combustion. Thus, if there are no commercially 
  viable CO<sub>2</sub> capture and sequestration technologies, the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions are closely related to the carbon content of the fuel. If CO<sub>2</sub> 
  capture and sequestration is implemented, an upstream system based on the carbon 
  content of fossil fuels could still be implemented, but it should be complemented 
  by a system of credits for sequestered CO<sub>2</sub>. Some fossil fuel is used 
  as a feedstock for products that sequester the carbon for a relatively long 
  time. An upstream system should include provisions to exempt the carbon sequestered 
  in such products. A particular aspect that can be introduced is to specify a 
  validity period of permits by establishing gradual devaluation and an expiration 
  date. By introducing this dynamic incentives could be created.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="38"></a>38</b> See NRTEE (1999) for a comprehensive overview of 
  options for the design of a domestic GHG tradable permit system. Remember that 
  the liable point may differ from the point of allocation. See Matsuo (1999) 
  and Iwahashi (1998) on this.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="39"></a>39</b> Tradable permits have been used to implement a cap 
  on SO<sub>2</sub> emissions by electricity generators in the USA and on NO<sub>x</sub> 
  and SO<sub>x</sub> emissions by large sources in the greater Los Angeles area 
  (the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) Programme; e.g., Schmalensee 
  <i>et al</i>. (1998); Stavins (1998a)).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="40"></a>40</b> NRTEE (1999) suggests that coverage for different 
  designs can range from 30% to over 90% of total emissions. Given a satisfactory 
  solution to the monitoring problems, cost-effectiveness is improved by including 
  as large a share of total emissions as possible in the tradable permit system.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="41"></a>41</b> The national government could choose to be a net 
  buyer or seller using the Kyoto mechanisms. To achieve compliance, the cap for 
  the domestic trading system should reflect the national limit after adjustment 
  for these international transfers. Whether the domestic cap is based on the 
  initial commitment (no government transfers under the mechanisms) or the ex 
  post limit, permit-liable entities could be allowed to acquire quotas under 
  the Kyoto mechanisms, if allowed by the rules governing those mechanisms, for 
  use towards compliance with their obligations under a domestic tradable permit 
  system.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="42"></a>42</b> The number of participants in the trading programme 
  could be small if a country chooses to make fossil-fuel producers and importers 
  permit-liable and there are very few such firms. This implies that the domestic 
  market for fossil fuels is not competitive. If the country created a competitive 
  market for fossil fuels, the number of permit-liable entities would likely be 
  sufficiently large to create a competitive market for permits as well. Sweden, 
  which imports all its fossil fuel, has some 350 fossil fuel importers that are 
  now liable to a carbon tax and that would be permit-liable should it choose 
  to shift to a tradable permit system.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="43"></a>43</b> Even under such circumstances a competitive permit 
  market could be created by restructuring the fossil fuel market.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="44"></a>44</b> Although the US SO<sub>2</sub> allowances are not 
  traded on an exchange, over 9.5 million allowances were transferred between 
  economically unrelated parties in 1998 and brokerage commissions for a simple 
  transaction are approximately 1% of the sale price.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="45"></a>45</b> For crude oil and natural gas, the options are exchange-traded 
  contracts. Such transactions also occur in the SO<sub>2</sub> allowance market; 
  they do not require exchange-listed contracts.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="46"></a>46</b> This is true regardless of the domestic policy adopted 
  to meet the GHG emissions limit. However, the total cost of meeting the limit, 
  and the distribution of that cost, may differ with the policy adopted (see <a href="260.htm#651">Section 
  6.5.1</a>).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="47"></a>47</b> Auctioned permits are equivalent to a tax, if adjusted 
  with a similar frequency, and are designed to achieve an equal emissions reduction 
  by the same sources. If, instead, tradable permits are allocated <i>gratis</i> to certain 
  entities, the same distribution is obtained as in the tax case if the tax revenue 
  is redistributed to these entities in the amount of the wealth of the permits 
  otherwise allocated to them (IPCC, 1996, p. 410). To redistribute the tax revenue 
  it is necessary to confirm the total amount of permits allocated. This means 
  that the taxation system in combination with the revenue redistribution inevitably 
  involves a key dimension of the permit trading system, so that the advantage 
  of the taxation system in administrative costs diminishes significantly. If 
  the scale of allocation for the permits in <i>gratis</i> is determined on the basis 
  of historical factors, the allocation in <i>gratis</i> does not reduce efficiency in 
  emissions reduction. Tax exemption and reduction, however, may reduce or even 
  eliminate incentives for emissions reduction and depreciate the efficiency factor 
  embraced in the taxation policies, because the scale of reduction or exemption 
  is determined by the current emissions quantities.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="48"></a>48</b> See Kopp <i>et al</i>. (1999b) for a discussion in the context 
  of domestic US policy; Roberts and Spence (1976) provide a theoretical discussion.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="49"></a>49</b> "For the purpose of this Communication Environmental 
  Agreements . can also take the form of unilateral commitments on the part of 
  industry recognized by the public authorities" (CEC, 1996, p. 5).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="50"></a>50</b> In some countries (e.g., Denmark) negotiated agreements 
  are explicitly linked to favourable treatment under tax regimes.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="51"></a>51</b> The issue of counterfactual baselines is revisited 
  in <a href="248.htm">Section 6.3.2.3</a> in the context of the Kyoto mechanisms.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="52"></a>52</b> This point of view is supported by the EC: "For the 
  purpose of this Communication Environmental Agreements . can also take the form 
  of unilateral commitments on the part of industry recognized by the public authorities" 
  (CEC, 1996, p. 5).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="53"></a>53</b> The SO<sub>2</sub> emissions trading regime has been 
  implemented in two phases. The first phase (beginning in 1995) imposed annual 
  emissions caps (with trading) on the 263 dirtiest large electricity-generating 
  units. The Substitution Provision allowed units regulated only by the second 
  phase (beginning in 2000) to voluntarily "opt in" in the first phase. Owners 
  of the first-phase plants could use these "substitution" units to lower the 
  compliance costs.<br>

  Long-term agreements on energy efficiency, results (published annually).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="55"></a>55</b> OECD/IEA (1997) includes 47 case studies of successful 
  energy-efficiency improvement projects and policies.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="56"></a>56</b> The Russian Center for Energy Efficiency, for instance, 
  since 1993 has published the "Energy Efficiency" quarterly bulletin. This stimulated 
  regional energy-efficiency legislation, policies, and programmes in Russia. 
  The bulletin is available on the Internet at http://www.glasnet.ru/~cenef.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="57"></a>57</b> Mandatory labelling programmes are under implementation 
  not only at a national level (e.g., <i>Energy Guide</i> in the USA), but also 
  internationally, such as "SAVE" in the EU. Voluntary labelling programmes were 
  also initially launched at the national level, such as "Blue Angel" in Germany 
  and "Power Smart" and "EcoLogo" in Canada, but then some were internationalized 
  (e.g. the originally US "Energy Star" programme for office equipment was introduced 
  in Japan).<br>

  <b><a name="58"></a>58</b> For some additional remarks see also <a href="261.htm">Section 
  6.5.3</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="59"></a>59</b> With sufficient incentives, some non-Annex I Parties 
  may ask to join in IET, replacing their expected use of the CDM, which is discussed 
  in <a href="247.htm#6322">Section 6.3.2.2</a> (Barros and Conte Grand, 1999; 
  Bohm and Carlén, 2000; Montero <i>et al</i>., 2000).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="60"></a>60</b> For illustrations of the potential gains from IET, 
  see Bohm (1997), Manne and Richels (1999), and Weyant and Hill (1999).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="61"></a>61</b> Each of the mechanisms, not just IET, includes a 
  so-called supplementarity provision, although the wording differs in the case 
  of the CDM. Some Parties have proposed rules to address supplementarity that 
  apply an overall limit on the use of the three mechanisms, rather than a separate 
  limit for each mechanism.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="62"></a>62</b> For a preliminary estimate of the cost implications 
  of the EU proposal for the definition of supplementarity, see Baron <i>et al</i>. (1999), 
  Bernstein <i>et al</i>. (1999), Criqui <i>et al</i>. (1999), and Ellerman and Wing (2000). 
  See Woerdman (2000) and Michaelowa and Dutschke (1999a) on additional reasons 
  for supplementarity.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="63"></a>63</b> The EU proposal to address supplementarity, for example, 
  includes a provision that limits the transfers of quotas and thereby limits 
  the trade of "hot air". Restricting trade of "hot air" allows these AAs to be 
  banked for use or sale during future commitment periods, thus reducing the cost 
  of compliance from what it otherwise would be during the future periods.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="64"></a>64</b> Whether sink-enhancement projects are eligible under 
  the CDM is still being negotiated.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="65"></a>65</b> How CDM projects can be financed is still being negotiated. 
  See Haites and Yamin (2000) for a summary of options.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="66"></a>66</b> Therefore, some developing countries have proposed 
  that a financial additionality requirement, which currently exists for the AIJ 
  pilot phase and states that ODA funds should not be invested in such projects, 
  should be extended to include the CDM. This view is not necessarily shared by 
  all Parties.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="67"></a>67</b> Estimates of the potential of the CDM are mounting 
  (see, e.g., Austin <i>et al</i>., 1998; Ellerman and Decaux, 1998; Zhang, 1999a), but 
  the estimates are very sensitive to the rules applied for the CDM and the other 
  Kyoto mechanisms.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="68"></a>68</b> Contractual options to address this concern are available 
  as well; the host government can insist on an option to acquire the right to 
  future CERs from a project without cost at a specified future date, such as 
  2013.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="69"></a>69</b> Note that the eligibility of sink enhancement projects 
  under the CDM is still being negotiated. <br>

  of uncertainty in estimates of emissions reduction because of the counterfactual 
  nature of the baseline (based on a number of AIJ energy sector projects) to 
  be between ±35% and ±60% depending on the project type.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="72"></a>72</b> For example, recent OECD/IEA baseline study references 
  are: "Revised Framework for Baseline Guidelines", "Multi-Project Emission Baselines: 
  Iron and Steel Case Study", "Multi-Project Emission Baselines: Final Cement 
  Case Study", "Multi-Project Emission Baselines: Forestry Status Report", "Multi-Project 
  Emission Baselines: Final Case Study on Energy Efficiency", Multi-Project Emission 
  Baselines: Final Electricity Case Study", and "Case-Studies on Baselines for 
  the Project-Based Mechanisms" (see http://www.oecd.org).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="73"></a>73</b> Parties may not respond to these incentives, for 
  instance, if such a response is incompatible with good business practices or 
  would generate public criticism.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="74"></a>74</b> The host government for JI projects has an incentive 
  to minimize baseline inflation only if it faces effective penalties for non-compliance. 
  Otherwise the benefits from the project could exceed the penalties because of 
  non-compliance. If the penalties for non-compliance by Annex I Parties are weak 
  or poorly enforced, JI projects could be subject to an international review 
  process with authority to establish the quantity of ERUs issued and/or the ERUs 
  could be incorporated into the liability provisions (see <a href="255.htm">Section 
  6.3.5.3</a>).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="75"></a>75</b> To improve efficiency a tax should be applied to 
  as many sources of GHG emissions as feasible.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="76"></a>76</b> Unlike side payments on a lump-sum basis, which remain 
  efficient, side payments and/or subsidies determined by emission levels are 
  not (because then the environmental impact of the original policy measure would 
  be reduced). In the case of a tradable quota regime, the side payments take 
  the form of more generous quota allocations, which are efficient, unless they 
  are tied to emission levels.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="77"></a>77</b> See http://www.epa.gov/appdstar/estar/<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="78"></a>78</b> Given the wording of Article 17, the participation 
  of legal entities in IET based on Article 17 would require an explicit decision 
  by CoP/MoP (see also <a href="246.htm#631">Section 6.3.1</a>).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="79"></a>79</b> For example, whether under a buyer liability system 
  transferred quotas would be invalidated pro rata or in reverse chronological 
  order.<br>

  (1999), Kurosawa, <i>et al</i>. (1999), Manne and Richels (1999), McKibbin <i>et al</i>. (1999), 
  Nordhaus and Boyer (1999), Tol (1999), Tulpulé <i>et al</i>. (1999), and Weyant and 
  Hill (1999) for estimates of the cost savings resulting from various international 
  quota trading arrangements. All the models assume efficient domestic policies, 
  and international trading, within each region. The models typically have between 
  four and 20 regions.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="81"></a>81</b> See Baron and Lanza (2000) for a review of modelling 
  results on the contribution of the Kyoto mechanisms.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="82"></a>82</b> See <a href="246.htm#631">Section 6.3.1</a> for a 
  discussion of supplementarity.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="83"></a>83</b> An experiment with emissions trading among government 
  teams representing four Nordic countries revealed a trading efficiency of 97% 
  (Bohm, 1997). Thus, their social MACs almost exactly equated at the national 
  level.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="84"></a>84</b> To explore the conditions under which different domestic 
  policies can minimize costs with the aid of the Kyoto mechanisms, Hahn and Stavins 
  (1999) examine pairs of countries with different combinations of domestic policies. 
  The discussion here presumes that all Annex I Parties wish to implement domestic 
  policies that enable all sources to equalize their MACs.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="85"></a>85</b> A similar system could be based on voluntary agreements 
  in which sources are allowed to trade emission reductions in the form of AAUs, 
  ERUs, or CERs.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="86"></a>86</b> The permits used in the domestic tradable permit 
  system could be AAUs. Alternatively, the domestic permits could be freely exchangeable 
  for AAUs.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="87"></a>87</b> Only sources or sinks not subject to the tax are 
  likely to be approved as JI projects, to reduce the risk of double counting.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="88"></a>88</b> See Ward and Black (2000, p. 122). Some MEAs, like 
  the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES, 1973), 
  the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous 
  Waste (UNEP, 1989), or the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete 
  the Ozone Layer Articles, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, restrict trade in polluting products 
  or products that contain controlled substances (UNEP, 1987). Some, like Montreal 
  Protocol Article 4.4, propose trade sanctions, but these are, however, not implemented, 
  even on products manufactured with polluting substances.<br>

  Article 22.1.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="90"></a>90</b> Black <i>et al</i>. (2000) note that if emissions trading 
  is treated as a financial service, there is no clear policy reason to exclude 
  non-Parties to the Kyoto Protocol from trading in these markets.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="91"></a>91</b> For example, a Party might impose equivalent product-specific 
  energy-efficiency standards on domestic and imported refrigerators or automobiles. 
  Or a Party might ban the domestic production and import of rice grown under 
  methane intensive cultivation methods or of wood harvested under non-sustainable 
  forestry practices. Alternatively, a party might impose a tax on the carbon 
  content of domestic and imported fuels or the carbon consumed in the production 
  of national and imported products. Finally, a Party might impose countervailing 
  duties against imports from nations that do not force the internalization of 
  GHG emissions costs on national producers.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="92"></a>92</b> National energy policies have long been replete with 
  distortionary subsidies (Black <i>et al</i>., 2000, pp. 90-98). However, since even 
  subsidies that encourage production below marginal factor costs have rarely 
  been GATT challenged, it is unlikely that national policies that fail to internalize 
  full environmental costs will be GATT illegal, unless they explicitly discriminate 
  between national production and imports. Energy efficiency subsidies to internalize 
  environmental benefits are, in principle, permissible under the GATT subsidies 
  code.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="93"></a>93</b> For example, when the EC concluded a voluntary agreement 
  with ACEA to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from automobiles in February 1999, 
  the Commission asked non-EU automobile manufactures to conclude the same kind 
  of agreements, fearing that the European car manufacturers might lose international 
  competitiveness. As a result, in October 1999, the Japanese Automobile Manufacturing 
  Association's voluntary commitment to follow the same standards was approved 
  by the EU. When the Japanese government enacted an amendment to strengthen fuel 
  efficiencies of automobiles, both European and American governments expressed 
  their concern, through formal TBT procedure, that it would become an invisible 
  trade barrier for automobile export. Also, when the EC intended to propose a 
  Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, both the US and Japanese 
  governments expressed the same concern.<br>

  <b><a name="96"></a>96</b> See Shrimp-Turtle decision, paragraphs 121 and 187b 
  (World Trade Organization, 1999); see also Perkins (1999, p. 119).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="97"></a>97</b> Nor is there yet guidance whether trade restrictions 
  could be enforced against a UNFCCC party with differentiated responsibilities 
  under the MEA, even if WTO-legal restrictions against imports from non-Annex 
  I Parties would confuse the meaning of "differentiated responsibilities".<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="98"></a>98</b> Economists have long noted the lack of precision 
  of the categories direct and indirect taxes, as well as the dependence of the 
  ability to pass on the incidence of taxes to consumers (indirect taxes) on market 
  structure. However, the terms continue to be applied with reasonable ease in 
  legal practice (Demaret and Stewardson, 1994, pp. 14-16).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="99"></a>99</b> In the Superfund Tax case, US border charges on certain 
  waste creating feedstock chemicals used as inputs in the processing of imported 
  chemical derivative products were ruled to be legal. These border charges, equal 
  to taxes imposed on similar US feedstock, were held valid even though there 
  was no transboundary damage outside the nation of origin (World Trade Organization, 
  1988). A border tax on shrimp caught with turtle-unsafe methods and similar 
  to a domestic tax on such products would seem to fall under this rule. Products 
  that have been produced through differential production methods, like products 
  that have different environmental qualities in themselves, have usually been 
  considered to be not "like products" and therefore allowable objects of differential, 
  non-discriminatory taxes (Demaret and Stewardson, 1994, pp. 34-41).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="100"></a>100</b> A limited amendment to the treatment of energy 
  taxes was made in the Uruguay 1994 Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing 
  Measures. Border adjustments were allowed for those nations that still imposed 
  cumulative prior-stage indirect taxes on "energy, fuels, and oil used in the 
  production process". This exception to the hidden tax rule was intended to cover 
  only a limited set of nations (Demaret and Stewardson, 1994, pp. 29-30).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="101"></a>101</b> Hoel (1997) uses a simple model of a group of identical 
  countries that interact through mobile real capital. Given the total stock of 
  real capital for the group of countries as a whole, he demonstrates that if 
  competition in the goods markets is imperfect or if unemployment exists, a lack 
  of international policy co-ordination may lead to outcomes that are not Pareto 
  optimal. However, he finds there is no need for policy co-ordination if after-tax 
  wages are exogenous, but this seems to be a rather strong assumption.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="102"></a>102</b> Rose <i>et al</i>. (1998) analyzed the welfare impacts 
  of various tradable permit allocations and obtained results that are consistent 
  with many of the results of Edmonds <i>et al</i>. (1995).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="103"></a>103</b> GDP per capita in 1989 ranged from US$1,200-1,500 
  in Albania, Turkey, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to more than US$20,000 in Switzerland, 
  Luxembourg, and the Scandinavian countries (Bohm and Larsen, 1994).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="104"></a>104</b> Montero (2000b) finds that under incomplete enforcement 
  tradable permits perform relatively better than taxes.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="105"></a>105</b> For the basic analysis and economic intuition of 
  this literature, see Kolstad (2000, pp. 281-284).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="106"></a>106</b> There is, however, an interesting example in which 
  ambitious standards were finally achieved. New emission standards for passenger 
  cars (the so-called "Muskie" standard), when first enacted in the USA in 1970, 
  were thought to be too ambitious because no such technologies existed in the 
  world. However, a technology breakthrough by two automobile manufacturers in 
  Japan achieved the standard (Honma, 1978; OECD, 1978).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="107"></a>107</b> Zerbe (1970) couches his research in terms of adoption. 
  Downing and White (1986) frame their work in terms of innovation. Milliman and 
  Prince (1989) use one model to discuss both diffusion and innovation, the latter 
  being defined essentially as the initial use of the technology by an "innovating" 
  firm. Malueg (1989) presents the same framework as a model of adoption. Jung 
  <i>et al</i>. (1996) present their model as one of either adoption or innovation.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="108"></a>108</b> Related to this is the finding of Parry (1998) 
  that the welfare gain induced by an emissions tax is significantly greater than 
  that induced by other policies only for very major innovations. Also related 
  is Montero's (2000c) conclusion that the relative superiority of alternative 
  policy instruments in terms of their effects on firm investments in R&D depends 
  upon the nature of the underlying market structure. This is implied by Laffont 
  and Tirole (1996).<br>
