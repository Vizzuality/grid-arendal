<h3>5.1.1 Summary of the Second Assessment Report &#150; Barriers and Opportunities 
</h3>
<p>The topic of barriers to the market penetration of environmentally sound technologies 
  (ESTs) was treated in Section 1.5.3 (&#147;Market failures and government responses&#148;) 
  of the Working Group (WG) III SAR, and also in Chapter 8, Sections 8.2.3 (&#147;Key 
  factors affecting the magnitude of costs: Costs as a function of baselines and 
  policy strategies&#148;), and 8.4.3 (&#147;The top-down vs. bottom-up modelling 
  controversy: Some lessons from the energy field&#148;) respectively. The latter 
  sections dealt with the discussion of the differences between top-down and bottom-up 
  modelling when estimating the costs of strategies to reduce or control GHG emissions. 
  The primary question raised in the discussion in the SAR may be summarized as: 
  Given market prices, do firms fail to take advantage of all the energy efficiency 
  opportunities available to them? Thus, a business investment decision, considering 
  private costs, may not undertake all the available efficiency opportunities. 
  Likewise, in the modelling sections, the discussion focused on the existence 
  of the &#147;no regrets&#148; potential. Its existence implies that (1) market 
  and/or institutional failures exist, and (2) cost-effective policies targeted 
  to correct these can be identified and implemented. The SAR notes four categories 
  of market imperfections that explain the above phenomena, and the policies that 
  could be used to address them. A more detailed discussion of these topics is 
  included in other sections of this chapter. </p>
<p><i>Information Dissemination </i><br>
  Acquiring information is costly, and markets, on their own, do not provide an 
  efficient level of disclosure of information. Governments can amend this by 
  providing information or instituting legislation and/or regulations that requires 
  disclosure of information, e.g., requiring energy performance labels on household 
  appliances (see <a href="197.htm">Section 5.3.7</a> for further discussion on 
  lack of information as a barrier).</p>
<p><br>
  <i>Bureaucratic Structure and Limited Scope of Attention</i><b> </b><br>
  Economic and organizational theory has emphasized that large organizations are 
  not, in general, run by owners; that the managers, even with best-designed incentives, 
  do not in general maximize the firm&#146;s market value; and that among the 
  principal scarce factors within an organization are time and attention. Governments 
  could provide information on energy efficiency that managers could access with 
  ease, which may yield private returns higher than their marginal costs. (See 
  <a href="193.htm#5352">Sections 5.3.5.2</a> and <a href="211.htm">5.4.3</a> 
  for further discussion on barriers and opportunities in the industrial sector.)</p>
<p><i>Returns to Scale and Network Externalities</i><b> </b><br>
  Technologies or projects may require large infrastructure or size in order to 
  make them economic. The scale of such a project, e.g., a natural gas-based transportation 
  system, may deter investment, although it may be cost-effective in comparison 
  to a gasoline-based system at some higher future oil price (see <a href="192.htm">Sections 
  5.3.5</a> for further discussion on network externalities).</p>
<p><i>Capital Market Imperfections </i><br>
  Studies of implicit discount rates have shown that households and firms behave 
  as if they use rates substantially above the market rate for long-term government 
  bonds. Firms use discount rates that reflect the riskiness of projects, and, 
  as a result of imperfect information, households and firms often face rationing 
  in capital markets for credit and equity. Economists emphasize that timing, 
  risk, capital constraints, and information or lack thereof should be dealt with 
  separately. A discount rate should reflect investment timing questions, risk 
  should be treated by converting costs and benefits into certainty equivalents, 
  and shadow pricing should address constraints on capital. Lack of information 
  could be addressed through government intervention (see <a href="190.htm">Sections 
  5.3.3</a> for further discussion on financing).</p>
