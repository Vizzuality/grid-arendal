<p><a name="fig103"></a>There is an increased interest in cost-minimizing paths 
  that lead to alternative, stable steady-state concentrations of GHGs in the 
  atmosphere. This interest stems from the objective of the UNFCCC&#150;to stabilize 
  the concentration of GHGs. Work has focused primarily on the problem of stabilizing 
  the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>. The focus on CO<sub>2</sub> reflects the 
  importance placed on this gas by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
  Working Group I (IPCC WGI) and the distinctive characteristic of CO<sub>2</sub>. 
  As CO<sub>2</sub> does not have an atmospheric sink, the net emissions to the 
  atmosphere must eventually decline indefinitely to maintain any steady-state 
  concentration (IPCC, 1996a). In contrast, GHGs such as CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, 
  with atmospheric sinks, have steady-state concentrations associated with steady-state 
  emissions. Cost-effective paths depend on many factors including reference emissions, 
  technical options for emissions limitation, the timing and rate of change of 
  the availability of options, the discount rate, and assumed control mechanisms 
  and their efficiency. The analysis conducted to date generally does not take 
  into account that long-term emissions mitigation must take place against a background 
  of climate change that affects both the nature and composition of economic activity 
  and the carbon cycle.</p>
<p>Both Manne and Richels (1997) and Edmonds <i>et al</i>. (1997) examined the relationship 
  between steady-state concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and associated minimum 
  costs. Both papers computed the minimum cost of honouring a concentration ceiling. 
  All cost calculations assumed that all activities throughout the world pursued 
  emissions mitigation based on a common marginal cost of carbon emissions mitigation. 
  While real-world implementation strategies are likely to be less efficient, 
  the choice of a cost-effective assumption for each period provides a unique 
  benchmark for comparison purposes. Several assumptions regarding cost-effectiveness 
  over time were examined. The two studies examined three cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>global emissions limited to a trajectory prescribed by IPCC (1995), labelled 
    WGI;<br>
  </li>
  <li>global emissions limited to a trajectory prescribed by Wigley <i>et al</i>. (1996), 
    labelled WRE; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>a model-determined minimum-cost emissions path.</li>
</ul>
<p>Costs were discounted over time at 5%/yr over the period 1990 to 2100. The 
  results are displayed in <a href="#fig103">Figure 10.3</a>.</p>
<p>Costs are roughly an order of magnitude greater for concentration ceilings 
  of 450ppmv than for the 750ppmv ceiling between WGI, WRE, and optimal global 
  emissions constraints. Furthermore, costs decline sharply as the constraint 
  is relaxed from 450ppmv to 550ppmv. Relaxation of the constraint from 650ppmv 
  to 750ppmv reduces costs, but at a more modest rate. As discussed in <a href="068.htm">Chapters 
  2</a>, <a href="266.htm">7</a> and <a href="319.htm">8</a>, it should 
  be noted that the total costs of stabilizing atmospheric carbon concentrations 
  are very dependent on the baseline scenario: for example, for scenarios focusing 
  on the local and regional aspects of sustainable development costs are lower 
  than for other scenarios.</p>
<p>Progress has also been made in examining the time path of the value of a tonne 
  of carbon when the cost of stabilizing the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> is 
  minimized. Peck and Wan (1996) demonstrated that the results of Hotelling (1931) 
  could be applied to the problem of minimizing the cost to stabilize the concentration 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> and generalized. They show that to minimize present discounted 
  cost, the value of a tonne of carbon should rise at the rate of interest (discount 
  rate). This theorem ensures that the marginal cost of emissions mitigation across 
  both space and time is equal after taking into account that carbon is naturally 
  removed from the system. Thus, the initial marginal costs should be relatively 
  modest, but should rise steadily (at the rate of interest plus the rate of carbon 
  removal, approximately 1%/yr). The rise in marginal cost continues until it 
  reaches the marginal cost of a &#147;backstop&#148; technology, one capable 
  of providing effectively unlimited emissions mitigation at a constant marginal 
  cost.</p>
<p>All cost-effective policies minimize the cost of stabilization by equalizing 
  the marginal cost of mitigation across time and space, that is, in all regions, 
  across all human activities, and across all generations, except to the extent 
  that non-linearities, non-convexities, and corner solutions exist. The implementation 
  of real-world regimes to control net emissions to the atmosphere is likely to 
  be inefficient to some degree for a number of reasons, including, for example, 
  the problems of &#147;free riding&#148;; cheating; in some cases considerations 
  of fairness and equity; and monitoring, compliance, and transactions costs.</p>
<p>Some work has been undertaken to compare potential policy regimes with respect 
  to cost-effectiveness. For example, <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> shows 
  the difference in emissions mitigation requirements between various potential 
  implementations of the Kyoto Protocol and more cost-effective paths. Edmonds 
  and Wise (1998) examined the cost effectiveness of a strategy that sought to 
  minimize the costs of monitoring and verification, and premature retirement 
  of capital stocks, while simultaneously addressing concerns about fairness and 
  equity. They considered a hypothetical protocol that focused on new investments 
  in energy technology. They assumed that Annex I nations required new emissions 
  sources to be carbon-neutral after a prescribed date. Existing sources were 
  treated as new after a fixed period following their initial deployment. Non-Annex 
  I nations remained unencumbered until their incomes reached levels comparable 
  to those in Annex I nations. The authors concluded that the regulatory regime 
  could stabilize the concentration of GHGs, and that the level at which concentrations 
  stabilized is determined by the initial date of obligations. The hypothetical 
  protocol is economically inefficient, however. That is, it does not minimize 
  the cost of achieving a concentration limit. The authors compare the hypothetical 
  protocol, which uses a technology regulation to limit emissions, with an alternative 
  cap-and-trade regime that achieved the same emissions path. Costs in the hypothetical 
  protocol were approximately 30% greater than in those in the alternative cap-and-trade 
  regime.</p>
<p>Jacoby <i>et al</i>. (1998) also considered the problem of accession to the Kyoto 
  Protocol. They reject the idea that there is such a thing as inter-temporal 
  cost-effectiveness in the context of a century-scale problem. Rather, they begin 
  with the proposition that a continuous process of negotiation and re-negotiation 
  is required. They analyze a system of obligations based on per-capita income 
  that can lead to the stabilization of concentrations of GHGs.</p>
<p>A substantial body of work has considered the implication of technology development 
  and deployment on the cost of meeting alternative emissions-mitigation obligations. 
  This line of investigation has a long tradition extending back to, for example, 
  Cheng <i>et al</i>. (1985). These are discussed in <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a>.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>3</sup></small></a> 
  Recent studies, for example by Dooley <i>et al</i>. (1999), Edmonds and Wise (1999), 
  Gr&uuml;bler <i>et al</i>. (1999), PCAST (1999), Schock <i>et al</i>. (1999), and Weyant and 
  Olavson (1999), have explored the potential role of a variety of technologies 
  in both the near term and the longer term. The principal conclusion of this 
  body of investigation is that the cost of emissions mitigation depends crucially 
  on the ability to develop and deploy new technology. The value of successful 
  technology deployment appears to be large with the value depending on the magnitude 
  and timing of emissions mitigation and on anticipated reference scenario progress.</p>
