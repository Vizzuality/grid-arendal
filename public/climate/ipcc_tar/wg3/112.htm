<p>Differences in emission reduction potential are mainly caused by differences 
  in specific energy consumption of industrial processes. In recent years attention 
  was paid to developing methods to compare energy efficiency levels on a physical 
  basis (Phylipsen <i>et al</i>., 1998a), in addition to methods that compare energy 
  efficiency levels on a monetary basis (see, e.g., Schipper and Meyers, 1992). 
  Energy efficiency indicators on a physical basis start from the level of energy 
  consumption per unit of product (e.g., expressed in GJ/t). However, countries 
  may differ in the production structure per sector (<i>i.e.</i> differences in product 
  mix and associated differences in feedstocks used). Correction for such differences 
  can take place by relating the specific energy consumption level for each product 
  to a best practice level, resulting in a so-called energy efficiency index. 
  The more efficient the aggregate of processes in a sector in a country, the 
  lower the energy efficiency index. The energy efficiency indices are scaled 
  in such a way that if all processes were operated at the best-practice level, 
  the index would be 100.</p>
<p>Results up to now are presented in <a href="#fig313">Figure 3.13</a>. Apart 
  from correction for structure, international comparison of energy efficiency 
  requires correction for statistical errors. A common source of error in the 
  process industries is the double counting of fuels (e.g., in the iron and steel 
  industry double counting of coke input to the blast furnace and blast furnace 
  gas). After correction for such errors the energy efficiency indicators &#150; 
  like those presented in <a href="108.htm#tab319">Table 3.19</a> &#150; show 
  a typical uncertainty of 5% (Farla, 2000).</p>
<p>Despite the remaining uncertainties, some conclusions can be drawn from these 
  data. In general Japan and South Korea and countries in Western Europe show 
  the lowest energy efficiency index (<i>i.e.</i>, they are most efficient). Developing 
  countries, economies in transition and some OECD countries (like the USA and 
  Australia) show higher levels of this index. However, there are certainly exceptions; 
  for instance, some developing countries show fairly low levels of the energy 
  efficiency index for some sectors. This may be explained by the fact that these 
  countries are developing at a high rate, and hence apply relatively young and 
  modern technology. In general the countries with the highest energy efficiency 
  index will have the highest technical potential for energy efficiency improvement. 
  The differences in economic potential may be smaller, as a consequence of the 
  lower energy prices that often occur in the less efficient countries. In this 
  section a number of regional studies &#150; mainly into energy efficiency in 
  industry &#150; are reviewed.</p>
<a name="3551"></a> 
<h4>3.5.5.1 China </h4>
<p>Industry is responsible for 75% of commercial energy end-use in China (IEA, 
  1997d). The period from 1980 to 1996 has seen a strong economic growth and growth 
  of industrial production, but also a substantial decline of the energy/GDP ratio 
  of about 4% per year (China Statistical Yearbook). The share of energy efficiency 
  and structural change in this decline is uncertain, but it is clear that substantial 
  energy efficiency improvement was obtained (Zhou and Hu, 1999; Sinton, 1996). 
  Nevertheless, Chinese industry is still substantially less energy efficient 
  than most OECD countries (Wu and Wei, 1997), see also <a href="#fig313">Figure 
  3.13</a>. Within industry, the steel industry is most important, consuming 23% 
  of industrial energy use in 1995 (IEA, 1997d). Zhou and Hu (1999) analysed the 
  differences between the Chinese and the efficient Japanese iron and steel industry 
  and identified a range of measures to improve the specific energy consumption 
  of the Chinese steel industry. Important measures are the recovery of residual 
  gases (2.7GJ/t steel); boiler modification and CHP (2.1 GJ/t); improved feedstock 
  quality (2.1GJ/t); wider application of continuous casting (1.0GJ/t); and others 
  (2.0GJ/t). The total leads to a reduction of 25% compared to the present average 
  of 35.6GJ/t (Zhou and Hu, 1999). An analysis of future prospects by Worrell 
  (1995) shows that, in the case steel production grows from 93Mt in 1995 to 140Mt 
  in 2020, energy consumption in the Chinese steel industry is likely to grow. 
  But the growth can be very moderate if modern technologies, like smelt reduction 
  and near-net-shape casting, are adopted. Also for two other important sectors, 
  the building materials industry and the chemical industries, substantial technical 
  saving potentials are reported (Zhou and Hu, 1999). Liu <i>et al</i>. (1995) report 
  for the cement industry &#150; consuming 10% of industrial energy use in 1995 
  &#150; a potential for reduction of the specific energy consumption of 32% in 
  the period 1990 to 2000; associated investments are estimated at 105 billion 
  yuan (~US$13 billion). Important economically viable options are comprehensive 
  retrofit of vertical kilns (e.g., improving refractory lining) and wet kilns, 
  and kiln diameter enlargement and retrofit. Similar savings can be reached when 
  adding a pre-calciner to the kilns, which is, however, the most expensive option. 
  All cost-effective measures add up to a 20% reduction of primary energy consumption 
  compared to the base line energy use in 2010 (Sinton and Yang, 1998).</p>
<a name="3552"></a> 
<h4>3.5.5.2 Japan</h4>
<p>In Japan, industry accounts for nearly half of the final energy demand. Industrial 
  energy demand is stabilizing, mainly because of the shift from heavy industry 
  to sectors like electrical machinery, precision instruments, and motor vehicles.</p>
Substantial energy efficiency improvements have been obtained, and Japan is 
  now one of the most efficient countries in the world (see also <a href="#fig313">Figure 
  3.13</a>). Nevertheless, there are still energy efficiency improvement potentials. 
  Current technical potential is 10%&#150;12% in the iron and steel industry. 
  Under the influence of a carbon tax, the potential is 8% in the cement industry 
  and 10% in the chemical industry. Costs of saving energy are in the majority 
  of the cases lower than energy purchase costs at a 5% discount rate (Kashiwagi 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999). Kainuma <i>et al</i>. (1999) have carried out an analysis of various 
  policies using the AIM model and find maximum absolute reductions of industrial 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 15% (in the base case the absolute emission reduction 
  is 3%). The increasing concern about the climate change issue has required setting 
  a new higher target to curb energy use to the FY 1996 level in FY 2010, which 
  requires an energy savings of approximately 10% of final demand in the industrial 
  sector by the revision of the Energy Conservation Law put into force in April 
  1999 (MITI, 1999).<br>
