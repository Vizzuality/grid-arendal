<h3><a name="433"></a>4.3.3 Opportunities in Agricultural Lands </h3>
<p>Most ecosystems, under constant conditions, eventually approach a steady-state 
  C stock that is dictated by management, climate, and soil properties. But changes 
  imposed on the ecosystem can alter the balance of C inputs and losses, shifting 
  the ecosystem, eventually, to a new steady state (Paustian <i>et al</i>., 1997c). For 
  example, after conversion of forests or grasslands to arable agriculture, losses 
  of C often exceed inputs temporarily, resulting in a net loss of C to the atmosphere 
  until a new, lower equilibrium level is reached (Balesdent <i>et al</i>., 1998; Huggins 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998; Solomon <i>et al</i>., 2000). At least a portion of C lost, however, 
  can often be recovered by adopting management practices that again favour higher 
  C stocks (Cole <i>et al</i>., 1997). The accumulation of C in soil can continue until 
  a new steady state is reached, often after several or more decades. Most of 
  the additional C is stored in the soil as organic matter. Apart from agroforests, 
  agricultural lands store very little carbon in plant biomass (<a href="157.htm#tab41">Table 
  4.1</a>).</p>
<p>There are two general ways of increasing C stocks in agricultural lands: by 
  changing management within a given land use (e.g., cropland, rice land, grazing 
  land, or agroforests) or by changing from one land use to another (e.g., cropland 
  to grassland or cropland to forest) (Sampson <i>et al</i>., 2000). In this section, 
  we review briefly the possible ways of increasing C stocks in agricultural lands, 
  first within a land use and then by a change in land use. We then review recent 
  estimates of the potential for increasing C stocks in agricultural lands globally. 
  A more detailed assessment of management practices and corresponding rates of 
  C accrual is reported in the IPCC Special Report on LULUCF (IPCC, 2000a).</p>
<p>Croplands, as referred to here, are lands devoted, at least periodically, to 
  the production of arable crops (wetland rice, because of its unique features, 
  is discussed separately). Soil C in these lands can often be preserved or enhanced 
  by using farming systems with reduced tillage intensity, thus slowing the rate 
  at which soil organic matter decomposes (Bajracharya <i>et al</i>., 1997; Feller and 
  Beare, 1997; Rasmussen and Albrecht, 1997; Dick <i>et al</i>., 1998). Another way to 
  promote higher soil C is to increase crop yields. This can be done by applying 
  organic amendments, by effective use of fertilizers, by using improved crop 
  varieties, or by irrigating. These practices help replenish soil organic matter 
  by increasing the amount of crop residues returned to the soil (Raun <i>et al</i>., 
  1998; Huggins <i>et al</i>., 1998; Paustian <i>et al</i>., 1997b; Lal <i>et al</i>., 1998; Smith 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997; Fernandes <i>et al</i>. 1997; Izac 1997). Further, soil C can often be 
  increased by using practices that extend the duration of C fixation by photosynthesis; 
  for example, cover crops, perennial forages in rotation, and avoiding bare fallow 
  tend to increase organic C returns to soil (Lal <i>et al</i>., 1997; Singh <i>et al</i>., 
  1997a; Smith <i>et al</i>., 1997; Carter <i>et al</i>. 1998; Tiessen <i>et al</i>., 1998; Tian <i>et al</i>., 1999; Paustian <i>et al</i>., 1997a, 2000). Farming techniques that reduce erosion 
  (e.g., terracing, windbreaks, and residue management) maintain productivity 
  and also prevent loss of C from agricultural soils. The net effect of soil erosion 
  on atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is still uncertain, however, because the C removed 
  may be deposited elsewhere and at least partially stabilized (van Noordwijk 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997; Lal <i>et al</i>., 1998; Stallard, 1998). </p>
<p>Rice land, as the term is used here, refers to areas that are at least periodically 
  flooded for wetland rice production. Carbon stocks in these systems can be preserved 
  or enhanced by the addition of organic amendments (Singh <i>et al</i>., 1997b; Kumar 
  <i>et al</i>., 1999) and nutrient management (Yadav <i>et al</i>., 1998). Rice lands, however, 
  are an important source of methane and, from the standpoint of overall radiative 
  forcing, management effects on methane emissions may be more important than 
  effects on C storage (Greenland, 1995; Sampson <i>et al</i>., 2000). Methane emissions 
  can be suppressed to some extent by soil amendments, altered tillage practices, 
  water management, crop rotation, and cultivar selection (Minami, 1995; Kern 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997; Neue, 1997; Yagi <i>et al</i>., 1997; Van der Gon, 2000). For more information 
  on CH4 and N2O emissions from land use, see <a href="115.htm">Section 3.6</a>.</p>
<p>Grazing lands refer to natural grasslands, intensively managed pastures, savannas, 
  and shrublands used, at least periodically, to graze livestock. One way to increase 
  C stocks in these lands is to introduce new plant species. For example, the 
  introduction of N-fixing legumes increases productivity, thereby favouring C 
  storage (Fisher <i>et al</i>., 1997; Conant <i>et al</i>., 2001). Large increases in soil 
  C have been also reported from the introduction of deep-rooted grasses in South 
  American savannas (e.g., Fisher <i>et al</i>., 1994), though the area over which these 
  findings apply is still uncertain (Davidson <i>et al</i>., 1995). Other management 
  practices that can affect C storage include: changing grazing intensity and 
  frequency (Manley <i>et al</i>., 1995; Ash <i>et al</i>., 1996; Burke <i>et al</i>., 1997, 1998); 
  adding nutrients, especially phosphorus (Barrett and Gifford, 1999); controlling 
  fire (Burke <i>et al</i>., 1997; Kauffman <i>et al</i>., 1998); and irrigation (Conant <i>et al</i>., 2001). </p>
<p>Agroforests include trees on farms as part of the agricultural landscape (Sampson 
  <i>et al</i>., 2000). Unlike most other agricultural systems, agroforests store C in 
  the above and below ground vegetation as well as in soil organic matter (Fernandes 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997; Woomer <i>et al</i>., 1997). Examples of practices that can enhance C 
  stocks include: integrated pest management, optimum tree densities, superior 
  tree or crop cultivars, and better nutrient management (Sampson <i>et al</i>., 2000). 
</p>
<p>Land-use conversion involves transferring a given land area from one use to 
  another. Where the shift is to a land use with higher potential C storage, the 
  conversion can result in increased C stocks. For example, conversion of cropland 
  to grassland often increases soil C (e.g., Paustian <i>et al</i>., 1997b; Reeder <i>et al</i>., 1998; Potter <i>et al</i>., 1999; Post and Kwon, 2000). Carbon stocks may also 
  be enhanced by conversion of cropland to forests (reforestation, afforestation) 
  or to agroforests (e.g., Fernandes <i>et al</i>., 1997; Woomer <i>et al</i>., 1997; Falloon 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998; Post and Kwon, 2000). In some cases, cultivated lands can be restored 
  as wetlands (Paustian <i>et al</i>., 1998; Lal <i>et al</i>., 1999), resulting in carbon gains, 
  though this practice may also result in higher net CH4 emissions (Willison <i>et al</i>., 1998; Batjes, 1999; Sampson <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
<p>Another form of land-use conversion is the rehabilitation of severely degraded 
  lands. Severely degraded lands are those where previous management has caused 
  a drastic decline or disruption of productivity. Large areas of degraded lands 
  occur on lands previously used for agriculture; lands abandoned after excessive 
  erosion, over-grazing, desertification, or salinization (Oldeman, 1994; Lal 
  and Bruce, 1999). Often the degradation was caused by social and economic pressures, 
  and land rehabilitation may depend on the amelioration of the underlying causes 
  of degradation. Specific rehabilitation practices include: introduction of new 
  species (e.g., reforestation), addition of nutrients, and organic amendments 
  (e.g., Lal and Bruce, 1999; Lal <i>et al</i>., 1998; Izaurralde <i>et al</i>., 1997). </p>
<p>Various attempts have been made to estimate potential C storage by improved 
  management of agricultural lands. In the IPCC Second Assessment Report, Cole 
  <i>et al</i>. (1996) estimated the potential for C storage in agricultural soils from 
  improved management of existing croplands, restoration of degraded lands, and 
  conversion to grass or forestlands. By assuming that one-half to two-thirds 
  of the estimated historic C loss from cultivated soils could be recovered in 
  50 years, they proposed potential soil C increases of about 0.4 to 0.6GtC/yr 
  from better management of existing agricultural soils. According to their estimates, 
  additional C could be stored by set-aside of surplus upland soils (0.015 to 
  0.03GtC/yr), restoration of wetlands (0.006 to 0.012GtC/yr), and restoration 
  of degraded lands (0.024 to 0.24GtC/yr), yielding a combined potential of about 
  0.44 to 0.88GtC/yr over a 50-year period. Later studies have provided similar 
  estimates. Lal and Bruce (1999), using rates of soil C gain from the literature, 
  estimated global C storage potentials of 0.43 to 0.57GtC/yr in the next 20-50 
  years, from erosion control, soil restoration, conservation tillage and residue 
  management, and improved cropping practices. Batjes (1999), based partly on 
  C gains estimated by Bruce <i>et al</i>. (1999), proposed that an additional 14GtC 
  (&plusmn;7) could be stored in agricultural soils over the next 25 years by 
  improved management of &#147;degraded&#148; and &#147;stable&#148; agricultural 
  lands. Including &#147;extensive grasslands&#148; and &#147;regrowth forests&#148; 
  increased the estimate to 20GtC (&plusmn;10), corresponding to an average rate 
  of 0.58 to 0.80GtC/yr. </p>
<p>Sampson <i>et al</i>. (2000) recently completed a comprehensive assessment of potential 
  net C storage from land management as part of the IPCC Special Report on LULUCF 
  (IPCC, 2000a). According to their estimate, improved management within a land 
  use could result in global rates of C gain, in 2010, of 0.125GtC/yr for cropland, 
  &lt;0.008GtC/yr for rice paddies, 0.026GtC/yr for agroforestry, and 0.237GtC/yr 
  for grazing land. Potential rates of C gain in 2010 for land use conversion 
  were 0.391 GtC/yr for conversion of unproductive cropland and grasslands to 
  agroforests, &lt;0.004GtC/yr for restoring severely degraded land, 0.038GtC/yr 
  for conversion of cropland to grassland, and 0.004GtC/yr for conversion of drained 
  land back to wetland. Corresponding rates of potential C gains for 2040 were 
  consistently higher than those for 2010, often by a factor of about 2, though 
  confidence in these values was lower. Sampson <i>et al</i>. (2000) cautioned that their 
  estimates &#147;are approximations, based on interpretation of available data&#148; 
  and that, &#147;for some estimates of potential carbon storage, the uncertainty 
  may be as high as &plusmn;50%&#148;.</p>
<p>Most of these estimates assume widespread, concerted adoption of C-conserving 
  practices, and all have high uncertainty, stemming in part from the difficulty 
  of predicting adoption of C-conserving practices. The various estimates, furthermore, 
  cannot always be compared directly because of differences in practices, scope, 
  time-frame, and underlying assumptions. Most of the more recent estimates, however, 
  are within the same order of magnitude as those presented in the SAR (Cole <i>et al</i>., 1996). </p>
<p>Increases in soil carbon content in response to improved practices cannot continue 
  indefinitely. Eventually, soil C storage will approach a new equilibrium where 
  C gains equal C losses (Paustian <i>et al</i>., 2000). This new equilibrium will depend 
  on the management practices adopted, as well as on soil type and climatic conditions. 
  Consequently, rates of C gain will diminish with time, and estimates for a given 
  year cannot be extrapolated far into the future.</p>
<p>Once soils reach a new equilibrium, there is little further accumulation of 
  C. And if the C-conserving practice is discontinued (e.g., reversion from no-tillage 
  to intensive tillage), much of the previously gained C may be lost back to the 
  atmosphere as CO<sub>2</sub> (Dick <i>et al</i>., 1998; Stockfisch <i>et al</i>., 1999). Consequently, 
  the C stocks stored in soils are not necessarily permanent and irreversible.</p>
