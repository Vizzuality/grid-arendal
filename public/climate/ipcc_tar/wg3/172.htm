<h3><a name="452"></a>4.5.2 Institutional Structures and Equity Issues </h3>
<p>In order to realize the mitigation potential in part or in full, it would be 
  helpful to have a set of institutions to translate the policies and measures 
  into avoided emissions or carbon sequestration. In the United Nations Conference 
  on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in 1992, the importance of sustainable 
  forest management was emphasized under the &#147;Forest Principles.&#148; Subsequently, 
  the formulation of criteria and indicators was worked out under the Helsinki 
  and Montreal Processes, in which the maintenance and enhancement of forest resources 
  to contribute to the global carbon cycle is described. The same is a criterion 
  under the United Nations (UN-ECE/FAO, 2000). The three main types of necessary 
  institutions are global and/or regional, national and local, and/or community 
  based (IPCC, 2000b). At the global level, there exist government-based multilateral 
  institutions such as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 
  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Bank, and the International 
  Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO). All of these institutions are involved 
  in natural resource management, and can play a significant role in integrating 
  mitigation objectives in tropical forest management. Also, a wide array of non-governmental 
  organizations (NGOs) active in resource conservation and sustainable utilization, 
  as well as bilateral aid organizations, could play a more important role in 
  incorporating mitigation in their policy objectives. For example, investment 
  promotion agencies could be created to assist in the co-ordination of investment 
  into carbon projects (e.g., see Moura-Costa <i>et al</i>., 1999). Additionally, global 
  private enterprises could be encouraged to include climate mitigation measures 
  in their plans. Financial incentives may be required to achieve broad participation.</p>
<p>In tropical countries, forestry is dominated by government-based institutions, 
  mostly the departments of forestry and agriculture and/or those involved in 
  environmental management (WRI, 1987). These departments may need support and 
  new insight in order to effectively incorporate mitigation policies and measures 
  in their resource management activities. At a national level, there also exist 
  some institutions involving NGOs that focus on conservation and forest expansion, 
  as well as those dedicated to encouraging sustainable agriculture. Such institutions 
  may also include umbrella organizations involved in developmental activities 
  such as gender, poverty alleviation, etc. A few institutions, including non-governmental 
  and especially those involved in nature conservation and environmental services, 
  e.g., game reserves, tourism companies, and large-scale agricultural production, 
  could also incorporate mitigation considerations in their efforts.</p>
<p>At the local level, effective institutions include community leaderships, religious 
  institutions, schools, traditional organizations, and indeed the family. These 
  institutions are essential with regard to natural resource management and agricultural 
  practices, as well as for introducing mitigation-type activities that do not 
  contravene their basic needs to use their land and natural resources for sustenance.</p>
<p>Public, NGO, and private institutions, at each spatial level where they exist, 
  can focus on including GHG mitigation as one of their considerations, while 
  they oversee the use of forest and land resources to meet the developmental 
  aspirations of those in tropical countries and elsewhere. For example, a recent 
  study on sustainable livelihoods and carbon management discussed arrangements 
  to facilitate the involvement of small-scale farmers and rural communities in 
  carbon trading (Bass <i>et al</i>., 2000). An optimal mix of conservation, sequestration, 
  and substitution will be incidental or arise from the optimal management of 
  forest resources for producing desired goods and services as shown under various 
  tropical forest management stipulations (ITTA, 1983, 1994). In the tropical 
  biome, the most likely use of the optimal mix of management strategies will 
  be based on optimal management of forestry and agricultural resources in each 
  country. For example, balance between forest conservation, afforestation, reforestation, 
  and multiple land use of the forest and agricultural areas will predetermine 
  the extent of utilization of the land-use sectors for mitigation activities. 
  However, the existing policies in managing forest and agricultural resources 
  have been criticized as non-optimal (see, for example, Poore <i>et al</i>., 1989). 
  Optimal levels of substitution will be determined by the energy and industrial 
  policies of these countries, rather than by carbon sequestration criteria. </p>
<p>The so-called &#147;no regrets options&#148; can be identified and pursued 
  (see <a href="266.htm">Chapters 7</a> and <a href="319.htm">8</a> for 
  a discussion of no regrets options). Analysis has suggested that adequately 
  designed and implemented GHG mitigation options in forestry and agriculture 
  could help advance the countries&#146; own development priorities, at the same 
  time providing significant carbon sequestration (see Sheinbaum and Masera (2000) 
  for analysis at the country level).</p>
