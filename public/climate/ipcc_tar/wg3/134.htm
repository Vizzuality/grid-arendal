<h4>3.8.4.4 Technical CO<sub>2</sub> Removal and Sequestration</h4>
<p>Substantial reductions in emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuel combustion 
  for power generation could be achieved by use of technologies for capture and 
  storage of CO<sub>2</sub>. These technologies have become much better understood 
  during the past few years, so they can now be seriously considered as mitigation 
  options alongside the more well established options, such as the improvements 
  in fossil fuel systems described in <a href="126.htm#3841">Section 3.8.4.1</a>, 
  and the substitutes for fossil fuels discussed in <a href="128.htm#3842">Sections 
  3.8.4.2</a> and <a href="130.htm#3843">3.8.4.3</a>. Strategies for achieving 
  deep reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will be most robust if they involve 
  all three types of mitigation option.</p>
<p>The potential for generation of electricity with capture and storage of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  is determined by the availability of resources of fossil fuels plus the capacity 
  for storage of CO<sub>2</sub>. Fossil fuel resources are described in <a href="124.htm#382">Section 
  3.8.2</a> and published estimates of CO<sub>2</sub> storage capacity are discussed 
  below. These show that capacity is not likely to be a major constraint on the 
  application of this technology for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil 
  fuel combustion. </p>
<p>The technology is available now for CO<sub>2</sub> separation, for piping CO<sub>2</sub> 
  over large distances, and for underground storage. This technology is best suited 
  to dealing with the emissions of large point sources of CO<sub>2</sub>, such 
  as power plant and energy-intensive industry, rather than small, dispersed sources 
  such as transport and heating. Nevertheless, as is shown below, it could have 
  an important role to play in reducing emissions from all of these sources.</p>
<a name="38441"></a> 
<h4>3.8.4.4.1 Technologies for Capture of CO<sub>2</sub></h4>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> can be captured in power stations, either from the flue gas 
  stream (post-combustion capture) or from the fuel gas in, for example, an integrated 
  gasification combined cycle process (pre-combustion capture). At present, the 
  capture of CO<sub>2</sub> from flue gases is done using regenerable amine solvents 
  (Audus, 2000; Williams, 2000). In such processes, the flue gas is scrubbed with 
  the solvent to collect CO<sub>2</sub>. The solvent is then regenerated by heating 
  it, driving off the CO<sub>2</sub>, which is then compressed and sent to storage. 
  This technology is already in use for removing CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas, 
  and for separating CO<sub>2</sub> from flue gases for use in the food industry.</p>
<p>The concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in power station flue gas is between about 
  4% (for gas turbines) and 14% (for pulverized-coal-fired plant). These low concentrations 
  mean that large volumes of gas have to be handled and powerful solvents have 
  to be used, resulting in high energy consumption for solvent regeneration. Research 
  and development is needed to reduce the energy consumption for solvent regeneration, 
  solvent degradation rates, and costs. Nevertheless, 80%-90% of the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  in a flue gas stream could be captured by use of such techniques.</p>
<p>In pre-combustion capture processes, coal or oil is reacted with oxygen, and 
  in some cases steam, to give a fuel gas consisting mainly of carbon monoxide 
  and hydrogen. The carbon monoxide is reacted with steam in a catalytic shift 
  converter to give CO<sub>2</sub> and more hydrogen. Similar processes can be 
  used with natural gas but then air may be preferred as the oxidant (Audus <i>et 
  al</i>., 1999). The fuel gas produced contains a high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  making separation easier, so a physical solvent may be better suited for this 
  separation; the hydrogen can be used in a gas turbine or a fuel cell. Similar 
  technology is already in use industrially for producing hydrogen from natural 
  gas (e.g., for ammonia production). The integrated operation of these technologies 
  for generating electricity whilst capturing CO<sub>2</sub> has no major technical 
  barriers but does need to be demonstrated (Audus <i>et al</i>., 1999). </p>
<p>The concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in a power station flue gas stream can 
  be increased substantially (to more than 90%) by using oxygen for combustion 
  instead of air (Croiset and Thambimuthu, 1999). Then post-combustion capture 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> is a very easy step, but the temperature of combustion must 
  be moderated by recycling CO<sub>2</sub> from the exhaust, something which has 
  been demonstrated for use with boilers but would require major development for 
  use with gas turbines. Currently, the normal method of oxygen production is 
  by cryogenic air separation, which is an energy intensive process. Development 
  of low-energy oxygen separation processes, using membranes, would be very beneficial. 
</p>
<p>Other CO<sub>2</sub> capture techniques available or under development include 
  cryogenics, membranes, and adsorption (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme, 
  1993).</p>
<p>After the CO<sub>2</sub> is captured, it would be pressurized for transportation 
  to storage, typically to a pressure of 100 bar. CO<sub>2</sub> capture and compression 
  imposes a penalty on thermal efficiency of power generation, which is estimated 
  to be between 8 and 13 percentage points (Audus, 2000). Because of the energy 
  required to capture and compress CO<sub>2</sub>, the amount of emissions avoided 
  is less than the amount captured. The cost of CO<sub>2</sub> capture in power 
  stations is estimated to be approximately US$30-50/t CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  avoided (US$110-180/tC), equivalent to an increase of about 50% in the cost 
  of electricity generation.<br>
