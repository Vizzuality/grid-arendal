<h4>7.2.3.2 Property Prices or the Hedonic Method </h4>
<p>Property prices vary according to the many attributes associated with them. 
  House prices, for example, reflect size, commercial facilities, local infrastructure, 
  and other attributes such as environmental quality of the house location. From 
  statistical analyses of house prices, the contribution of environmental quality 
  to house price variations can be assessed, which is an estimate of how much 
  people are willing to pay for changes in environmental quality. This measure 
  represents a use value for that environmental change from which a demand function 
  can be estimated. The method has been used to value external effects such as 
  noise, air quality, and visibility. The main limitation is that to work efficiently 
  it requires the affected parties to be well informed about the impacts and markets, 
  so that decisions about location can be made freely and easily. For examples 
  of relevant studies see ExternE (1999), Palmquist (1991), and Zabel and Kiel 
  (2000). </p>
<h4><a name="7233"></a>7.2.3.3 Contingent Valuation Method</h4>
<p>By asking people directly how much they are willing to pay for a change in 
  a provision of benefits from an environmental resource, a hypothetical market 
  can be created in which a demand curve for ecological goods and services can 
  be estimated. This method is the only one by which non-use values can be estimated, 
  since hypothetical markets can be created for them. Since it is not based on 
  revealed preferences, on which the other demand approaches are based, contingent 
  valuation may incur in various biases, from strategic answers to lack of information. 
  Such biases are currently well documented and techniques have been developed 
  to reduce them. Contingent valuation methods have been used to value the use 
  and non-use of sites of special significance, health effects (including changes 
  in the risk of death), and damages to ecosystems (Bateman and Willis, 1999). 
  Despite the considerable amount of work on reducing the biases that arise because 
  such data do not report actual transactions, this method arouses considerable 
  scepticism among policymakers and its results are not always accepted. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, although such methods of valuation have problems, there is often 
  no suitable alternative and they provide policymakers with important information 
  for decision-making purposes. As suggested above, both physical impacts and 
  values should be used in this process. In relation to climate change, the estimation 
  of external effects arises primarily in the assessment of damages that result 
  from such change, including those in agriculture, forests, energy use, recreation, 
  and health. In relation to mitigation, the applications are primarily in valuing 
  the impacts of O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>x</sub>, particulate matter, 
  and secondary particles. In adaptation, the valuation of external effects arises 
  with respect to loss of land, changes to recreational facilities, and changes 
  to agriculture.</p>
