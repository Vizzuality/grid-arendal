Recent work in the theory of public choice (e.g., Michaelowa and Dutschke, 1998) 
suggests that a more dynamic view of institutions can be incorporated into this 
style of analysis. 
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="2"></a>2</b> Knight defined uncertainties 
  as either risks accessible using objective historical data or uncertainty where 
  there is little or no data and the underlying processes are not well understood. 
  The exposition here updates his original taxonomy to include more recent thinking 
  on a fuller range of degrees of uncertainties.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="3"></a>3</b> It is possible for the cost 
  curves to be very flat in certain regions, however, and technological change 
  can shift them down significantly over time.</p>
<p><b><span class="footnote_text"><a name="4"></a>4</span></b><span class="footnote_text"> 
  In principle these ancillary benefits should be credited only to the extent 
  of the cost of direct control of those pollutants they obviate.</span></p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="5"></a>5</b> This is an extensive and diverse 
  literature, of which a few examples are Ramakrishna (1992), Shue (1993, 1995), 
  Mintzer and Leonard (1994), Munasinghe (1994, 1995, 2000), Lipietz (1995), Parikh 
  (1995), Rowlands (1995), Runnalls (1995), Jamieson (1996, 2000), Murthy <i>et al</i>. 
  (1997), Parikh <i>et al</i>. (1997), Rajan (1997), Sagar and Kandlikar (1997), Schelling 
  (1997), Byrne <i>et al</i>. (1998), Najam and Sagar (1998), Parikh and Parikh (1998), 
  Tolba (1998), Agarwal <i>et al</i>. (2000).</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="6"></a>6 </b>The average per capita energy 
  consumption of low income households in developing countries is frequently only 
  about 10% of that of the upper-middle income groups in these countries, a pattern 
  that parallels the 1:10 ratio of per capita energy consumption between developing 
  and developed countries (see Siddiqui, 1995).</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="7"></a>7</b> Although this issue received 
  attention in the IPCC SAR (IPCC, 1996), the discussion was framed in technical 
  terms, namely the determination of the appropriate discount rate, which made 
  little accommodation for philosophical, legal, and sociological perspectives 
  on intergenerational rights and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="8"></a>8</b> The reason for this paradox 
  is that at the global level intercountry distributional impacts dominate over 
  the within-country impacts (see World Bank, 2000, p. 51).</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="9"></a>9</b> See, e.g., de Bruyn <i>et al</i>. (1998) 
  and Opschoor (1997), who develop this idea from a development perspective, and 
  Hoffert <i>et al</i>. (1998) who uses the &#147;Kaya Identity&#148; to formulate decompositions 
  from an energy economics perspective.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="10"></a>10 </b>This possibility is also corroborated 
  by time-series data on carbon intensity, which reveal evidence of &#147;de-coupling&#148; 
  of the strong relation in some countries, including developing countries. However, 
  the change has not been significant enough to reverse the overall trends towards 
  increasing emissions.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="11"></a>11</b> Much of the discussion on 
  equity invokes global commons as an organizing concept, especially with regard 
  to the conflict between individual (or corporate) use and global community interests. 
  This is a well-worn theme in the literature on collective action, dating back 
  to Hardin (1968), who saw unchecked population growth as the main problem. For 
  a recent and more nuanced view, see Ostrom (2000).</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="12"></a>12</b> In the literature cited by 
  Rayner <i>et al</i>. (1999) see, in particular, Grubb (1995), Burtraw and Toman (1992), 
  and Chichilnisky and Heal (1994). For a <span class="footnote_text">theoretical 
  framework on accident liability, see Calabrese (1970).</span></p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="13"></a>13</b> This group has been referred 
  to in the literature as the &#147;ecological refugees&#148; (Gadgil and Guha, 
  1995), the &#147;vagabonds&#148; (Bauman, 1998), the &#147;castaways&#148; (Latouche, 
  1993), and the &#147;excluded&#148; (Korten, 1995). However, some writers have 
  raised concerns that these groups impact climate change (as well as biodiversity) 
  adversely through non-sustainable land-use practices and deforestation.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="14"></a>14</b> However, current trends suggest 
  that mitigation has already begun in some non-Annex I countries, even in the 
  absence of deliberate climate policy. Reductions on fossil fuel subsidies (as 
  a percentage of existing subsidies) have been larger in developing countries 
  (especially China) than in OECD countries, and are leading to considerable savings 
  in carbon emissions (International Energy Agency, 1996; Johnson <i>et al</i>., 1996; 
  Reid and Goldemberg, 1997).</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="15"></a>15</b> However, defenders of the 
  CDM argue that the current options will disappear if not exploited immediately 
  (for the &#147;low-hanging fruit&#148; will rot if not picked early), and that 
  the early exploitation will transfer technology, capacity, and resources to 
  developing countries and enable them to access the more expensive options later 
  (see Haites and Aslam, 2000).</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="16"></a>16</b> For example, several authors 
  have commented on the initiation of attempts at Kyoto to incorporate developing 
  countries within an emissions control mandate as a retreat from the foundational 
  principles of the UNFCCC (Cooper, 1998; Jacoby <i>et al</i>., 1998; Schmalensee, 1998). 
  These attempts include the call for the adoption of voluntary emissions control 
  targets by non-Annex 1 countries (UNFCCC, 1997a).</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="17"></a>17</b> These innovations have also 
  yielded alternative indices of welfare, including the human development index 
  (HDI; see UNDP, 1989), basic human needs (BHN; see Streeten <i>et al</i>., 1981), the 
  physical quality of life index (PQLI; see Morris, 1979), and others.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><span class="footnote_text"><a name="18"></a>18</span></b> 
  <span class="footnote_text">&#147;Social capital&#148; is generally taken to 
  mean the network of social relationships, collective social capacities, and 
  institutions (Banuri <i>et al</i>., 1994; Clague, 1997).</span></p>
<p><b><span class="footnote_text"><a name="19"></a>19</span></b><span class="footnote_text"> 
  In the absence of detailed data that would (or, indeed, could) allow the aggregation 
  of the different components of the capital stock into a single index, the only 
  option is to pay attention to each component separately. The &#147;four capitals&#148; 
  approach has remained largely a conceptual device rather than an operational 
  one, even though it has often been applied at a project level to ensure that 
  all the necessary components are accounted for.</span></p>
<p><b><span class="footnote_text"><a name="20"></a>20 </span></b><span class="footnote_text">&#147;Capacity&#148; 
  is different from &#147;capital&#148;, although the two are related. The latter 
  implies the availability of income-generating capacity alone, while the former 
  suggests the freedom to make policy choices or to achieve social goals.</span></p>
<p><span class="footnote_text"><b><a name="21"></a>21</b> Indeed, some analysts 
  argue that the poor constitute a distinct &#147;livelihood&#148; economy, which 
  is not well integrated into the global trading and financial system, and therefore 
  lacks the flexibility to respond to emerging market opportunities or standard 
  economic policies (Korten, 1990, 1995).</span></p>
<p><span class="footnote_text"><b><a name="22"></a>22</b> EIA, <i>Energy Outlook</i>. 
  These scenarios do not account for the impact of the recent agreements in Kyoto 
  to curb emissions. The differences in trends in Annex I and non-Annex I are 
  similar in other baseline scenarios. Chapter 2 discusses the range of possible 
  scenarios and criteria for selection.</span></p>
<p><span class="footnote_text"><b><a name="23"></a>23</b> While in the previous 
  section on the equity perspective the emphasis is on an equitable distribution 
  of greenhouse gas emissions while taking into account sustainability criteria, 
  in this section on global sustainability the focus is on the implications of 
  an eventual decrease of global per capita emissions taking into account equity 
  criteria.</span></p>
<p><b><span class="footnote_text"><a name="24"></a>24</span></b><span class="footnote_text"> 
  In post-industrial economies, in particular, the resource intensity of GDP is 
  declining.</span></p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="25"></a>25 </b>Most of this literature contains 
  assessments of the economic potential of single technologies as well. For some 
  more detail, see Chapter 3 of this report.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="26"></a>26</b> For a more detailed discussion 
  of the so-called rebound effect, see the special issue of <i>Energy Policy</i>, 
  28 (2000), 355&#150;495.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="27"></a>27</b> This would lower the demand 
  for capital equipment and allow larger scale more efficient equipment to be 
  used, which in turn would lower resource use and GHG emissions.</p>
<p class="footnote_text"><b><a name="28"></a>28</b> Participants in international 
  research programme are mostly scientific experts and do not have expertise in 
  development, equity, or sustainability issues.</p>
