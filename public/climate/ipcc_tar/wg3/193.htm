<h4>5.3.5.1 Demand Side of the Market </h4>
<p>The diffusion of GHG-efficient technology may be limited by &#147;irrational&#148; 
  or less-than-rational behaviour of households and firms. Such behaviour may 
  be observed because of the way individuals process and act on whatever information 
  they may have. The behaviour of an individual during the decision-making process 
  may seem inconsistent with their goals. More or better information alone may 
  be insufficient to change behaviour, which is strongly influenced by habit or 
  custom (Brown and Macey, 1983).</p>
<p>Within organizations, various factors discourage or inhibit cost-effective 
  decisions regarding new technology. For businesses, the priority of other investment 
  opportunities (e.g., to maintain or expand market share and production capacity) 
  may cause the firm to reject cost-effective GHG-efficiency investment opportunities. 
  Where energy costs are a small component of total production costs, management 
  may not provide sufficient support for energy efficiency investments. In addition, 
  within a firm, no single party or department may have clear and explicit responsibility 
  for managing energy costs.</p>
<p>Another facet of behaviour that is often cited as a barrier to energy efficiency 
  investments is the demand for a rapid payback that may be either explicit or 
  implicit in behaviour. To some degree, the so-called high discount rate applied 
  by consumers could be seen as an aspect of &#147;irrational&#148; behaviour. 
  However, the demand for a rapid payback is also related to particular features 
  of energy-efficient products or services (such as uncertain performance), specific 
  circumstances related to home and appliance ownership, the context in which 
  these products are placed, or to macro-economic conditions, such as high inflation 
  or uncertain future energy prices.</p>
<h4><a name="5352"></a>5.3.5.2 Supply Side of the Market</h4>
<p><i>Limited Availability of Products or Services</i><b> </b><br>
  This may result from decisions and practices of manufacturers and/or distributors. 
  Firms that provide services related to energy efficiency may be few in number. 
  Availability is typically lower (and prices are higher) in rural areas than 
  in large cities. To some extent, limited availability of products and services 
  is a &#147;chicken and egg&#148; problem, which tends to be most problematic 
  in the early stages of market development for a more efficient product or service.</p>
<p><i>Weakness of Suppliers in Market Research</i><b> </b><br>
  Firms may lack the resources or capability to do adequate market research, thereby 
  inhibiting the development of new products or services for which there might 
  be a demand.</p>
<p><i>Weakness of Suppliers in Product Development</i><b> </b><br>
  Firms may be lacking in skills required for the development of new products, 
  or in capital for investment in new production capacity. Gaining access to advanced 
  designs and/or manufacturing techniques may also be a problem (related to international 
  technology flows).</p>
<p><i>Weak Marketing Capabilities of Suppliers</i><b> </b><br>
  Firms may lack the skills for adequate marketing of more efficient products 
  or services.</p>
