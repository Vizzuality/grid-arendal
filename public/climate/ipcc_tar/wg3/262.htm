<h4>6.5.3.1 Theoretical Analyses </h4>
<p>Most of the work in the environmental economics literature on the dynamic effects 
  of policy instruments on technological change has been theoretical, rather than 
  empirical, and the theoretical literature is considered first. The predominant 
  theoretical framework involves what could be called the &#147;discrete technology 
  choice&#148; model. In this, firms contemplate the use of a certain technology 
  that reduces the marginal costs of pollution abatement and that has a known 
  fixed cost (Downing and White, 1986; Jung <i>et al</i>., 1996; Malueg, 1989; Milliman 
  and Prince, 1989; Zerbe, 1970).</p>
<p>While some authors present this approach as a model of innovation, it is perhaps 
  more useful as a model of adoption.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#107","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>107</sup></small></a> 
  The adoption decision is one in which firms face a given technology with a known 
  fixed cost and certain consequences, and must decide whether or not to use it; 
  this corresponds precisely to the discrete technology choice model. Innovation, 
  on the other hand, involves choices about research and development expenditures, 
  with some uncertainty over the technology that will result and the costs of 
  developing it. Models of innovation allow firms to choose their research and 
  development expenditures, as in Magat (1978, 1979), or incorporate uncertainty 
  over the outcome of research (Biglaiser and Horowitz, 1995; Biglaiser <i>et al</i>., 
  1995).</p>
<p>Several researchers have found that the incentive to adopt new technologies 
  is greater under market-based instruments than under direct regulation (Downing 
  and White, 1986; Jung <i>et al</i>., 1996; Milliman and Prince, 1989; Zerbe, 1970). 
  This view is tempered by Malueg (1989), who points out that the adoption incentive 
  under a freely allocated tradable permits system depends on whether a firm is 
  a buyer or seller of permits. For permit buyers, the incentive is larger under 
  a performance standard than under tradable permits.</p>
<p>Comparisons among market-based instruments are less consistent. Downing and 
  White (1986), who consider the case of a single (sole) polluter, argue that 
  taxes and tradable permit systems are essentially equivalent. On the other hand, 
  Milliman and Prince (1989) find that auctioned permits provide the largest adoption 
  incentive of any instrument, with emissions taxes and subsidies second, and 
  freely allocated permits and direct controls last. Jung <i>et al</i>. (1996) consider 
  heterogeneous firms, and model the &#147;market-level incentive&#148; created 
  by various instruments. This measure is simply the aggregate cost savings to 
  the industry as a whole from adopting the technology. Their rankings echo those 
  of Milliman and Prince (1989).</p>
<p>On the basis of an analytical and numerical comparison of the welfare impacts 
  of alternative policy instruments in the presence of endogenous technological 
  change, Fischer <i>et al</i>. (1998) argue that the relative ranking of policy instruments 
  depends critically on firms&#146; ability to imitate innovations, innovation 
  costs, environmental benefit functions, and the number of firms that produce 
  emissions.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#108","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>108</sup></small></a> 
  Finally, the study includes an explicit model of the final output market, and 
  finds that it depends upon empirical values of the relevant parameters whether 
  (auctioned) permits or taxes provide a stronger incentive to adopt an improved 
  technology.</p>
<p>Finally, recent research investigates the combined effect of the pollution 
  externality and the positive externality that results from learning-by-doing 
  with mitigation technologies. Since the benefit from learning occurs after the 
  learning has taken place, a dynamic analysis is needed. Some analyses shown 
  that dynamic efficiency (discounted least cost, aggregated over time) requires 
  that the incentive for emissions-mitigating innovations be set higher than the 
  penalty on emissions, especially if account is taken of &#147;leakage&#148;. 
  This is in contrast with the conclusions of comparative static analysis upon 
  which most environmental policy analysis is grounded (e.g., Baumol and Oates, 
  1988), under which the two incentives should be equal in all time periods (for 
  a formal analysis, see Read (1999, 2000)).</p>
