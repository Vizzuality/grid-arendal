<h3>7.5.3 Development Projections </h3>
<p>The establishment of long-term projections for GHG emissions is particularly 
  complicated and uncertain for both developing countries and the EITs. These 
  economies are often in a transition process in which important GHG emission 
  sectors, such as the energy sector, industry, and transportation, are expected 
  to play an increasing role. It is not possible, however, to project accurately 
  the actual speed of this growth process and/or the GHG emission intensity of 
  these future activities. Modelling tools and data are also very limited or even 
  non-existent, and the only available information sources from which to generate 
  GHG emission projections are often the official national development plans that 
  cover a time horizon of 5&#150;10 years only.</p>
<p>Changes in the structure of GDP have to be given careful consideration. One 
  important aspect that could be integrated into the scenario development are 
  the changes in economic structure and relative prices that emerge from structural 
  adjustment programmes and other macroeconomic policies that many countries are 
  currently undertaking. Another crucial issue, following that, will be the development 
  of energy intensive and heavily polluting industrial activities, such as steel 
  and aluminium production. As the recent shift of heavy industries from the developed 
  towards the developing countries reaches its end, long-term economic output 
  could come from services and other less energy-intensive activities. In EITs 
  the issue is how fast and deep will the shift out of energy intensive industries 
  be, and what will replace it.</p>
<p>The basic uncertainty of long-term GHG emission projections encourages analysts 
  to use multiple baselines, each corresponding to a particular expectation of 
  the future development pattern. Each development pattern may exhibit a unique 
  emissions trajectory. A nation following development policies that emphasize 
  greater investments in infrastructure, such as efficient rail transport, renewable 
  energy technologies, and energy-efficiency improvements will exhibit a low emissions 
  trajectory. However, a nation with substantial coal resources, scarce capital, 
  and a low level of trade can be pushed towards a development path with high 
  emissions.</p>
<p>The spatial distribution of the population and economic activities is still 
  not settled in the developing countries. This raises the possibility of adopting 
  urban and/or regional planning and industrial policies to strengthen small and 
  medium cities and rural development, and thus reduce the extent of the rural 
  exodus and the degree of demographic concentration in large cities. In the same 
  way, technological choices can substantially decrease the energy demand and/or 
  GDP elasticities. The preservation of a certain cultural diversity, as opposed 
  to the trend towards a global uniformity of lifestyles, also favours less energy-intensive 
  housing, transportation, leisure, and consumption patterns, at least in some 
  cases. One example is related to development policies that avoid low urban population 
  density coupled with long daily trips to work and large shopping centres by 
  car.</p>
<p>It is a special challenge in costing studies to translate preferences for biological 
  and cultural diversity into a useful value measure. The market does not price 
  most of the services provided by biological or cultural diversity. Roughgarden 
  (1995) argues that there is no need to quantify the benefits of these services, 
  which are either so obvious or impossible to capture that measurement is unnecessary. 
  Following this line of argument, &#147;science&#148; should dictate a target 
  that could be used to establish a safe minimum standard&#150;a level of preservation 
  that guarantees survival of the species or culture in question (Ciriarcy-Wantrup, 
  1952). This minimum standard approach puts an infinite value on avoiding extinction. 
  This view puts biological or cultural diversity beyond the reach of economic 
  trade-offs, and the analyst attempts to find the least-cost solution to achieve 
  some set standard. </p>
<p>However, Epstein (1995) argues that preservation without representation of 
  benefits is unacceptable. It is suggested that hard evidence is needed to prove 
  that the biological and cultural preservation benefits dominate those from development. 
  It is then logical to compare the costs and benefits when resources are scarce, 
  and an attempt should be made to balance the costs and benefits so that funds 
  are allocated to their highest valued use.</p>
<p>Estimating the social value of biodiversity and culture is a major challenge. 
  For biodiversity values there is no consensus as to the usefulness of the primary 
  tool used to reveal the monetary value of these preferences&#150;contingent 
  valuation surveys. These public opinion surveys use a sequence of questions 
  to put a monetary value on personal preferences. However, since people are responding 
  to a survey rather than facing their own budget constraint and actually spending 
  their own money, no market discipline exists to challenge their statements (Brown 
  and Shogren, 1998). </p>
<p>The above possibilities of alternative development patterns highlight the technical 
  feasibility of low carbon futures in the developing countries that are compatible 
  with national objectives. However, the barriers to a more sustainable development 
  in developing countries can hardly be underestimated, from financial constraints 
  to cultural trends in both developed and developing countries, including the 
  lack of appropriate institutional building. Any abatement-cost assessment relies 
  on the implicit assumptions taken in the baseline or mitigation scenarios with 
  regard to the probability of removing these barriers.</p>
<p>Since mitigation costs for different development patterns may vary substantially, 
  one way to reflect this in mitigation cost analysis is to use a scenario-based 
  range of mitigation costs rather than a single mitigation cost (see also <a href="294.htm">Section 
  7.3.6</a>).</p>
