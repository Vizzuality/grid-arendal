<h4>7.2.2.1 Analytical Approaches </h4>
<p>Cost assessment is an input into one or more of the rules for decision making, 
  which are discussed in more detail in <a href="379.htm">Chapter 10</a> of 
  this report. Economic approaches to decision making include cost&#150;benefit 
  analysis, and cost-effectiveness analysis, and these approaches can be supplemented 
  with multi-attribute analysis that facilitates an integrated assessment of economic 
  impacts and other quantitative and non-quantitative information. These approaches 
  are briefly described in <a href="#box71">Box 7.1</a>.</p>
<p>It should be recognized that some types of impacts can be measured in both 
  monetary terms and physical terms. This applies, for example, to changes in 
  air pollution as a result of the reductions in GHGs.</p>
<p>There is a major difference between the economic approaches and multi-attribute 
  analysis in how the various dimensions of the assessment are summarized. The 
  economic approaches seek to provide aggregates to single measures based on an 
  economic welfare evaluation, while multi-attribute analysis does not provide 
  an aggregation of the different dimensions of the analysis.</p>

      <p><i><b>Cost&#150;benefit analysis</b></i><br>
        This measures all negative and positive project impacts and resource uses 
        in the form of monetary costs and benefits. Market prices are used as 
        the basic valuation, as long as markets can be assumed to reflect &#147;real&#148; 
        resource scarcities. In other cases the prices are adjusted to reflect 
        the true resource costs of the action. Such adjusted prices are referred 
        to as shadow prices (Squire and van der Tak, 1975; Ray, 1984).</p>
      <p><i><b>Cost-effectiveness analysis</b></i><br>
        A special case of cost&#150;benefit analysis in which all the costs of 
        a portfolio of projects are assessed in relation to a policy goal. The 
        policy goal in this case represents the benefits of the projects and all 
        the other impacts are measured as positive or negative costs. The policy 
        goal can, for example, be a specified goal of emissions reductions for 
        GHGs. The result of the analysis can then be expressed as the costs (US$/t) 
        of GHG emissions reductions (Sathaye <i>et al</i>., 1993; Markandya <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
      <p><i><b>Multi-attribute analysis</b></i><br>
        The basic idea of multi-attribute analysis is to define a framework for 
        integrating different decision parameters and values in a quantitative 
        analysis without assigning monetary values to all parameters. Examples 
        of parameters that can be controversial and very difficult to measure 
        in monetary values are human health impacts, equity, and irreversible 
        environmental damages (Keeney and Raiffa, 1993).</p>

<h4><a name="7222"></a>7.2.2.2 Cost Analysis and Development, Equity, and Sustainability 
  Aspects</h4>
<p>The underlying objective behind any cost assessment is to measure the change 
  in human welfare generated as the result of a reallocation or change in use 
  of resources. This implies the existence of a function in which welfare or &#147;utility&#148; 
  depends on various factors such as the amounts of goods and services that the 
  individual can access, different aspects of the individual&#146;s physical and 
  spiritual environment, and his or her rights and liberties. Constructing a &#147;utility 
  function&#148;, representing social welfare, that is an aggregate measure of 
  all such impacts for all individuals involves a number of complexities and controversial 
  equity issues that have been intensively studied by economists (see, for example, 
  Blackorby and Donaldson, 1988). However, the sum of the individual WTPs and 
  WTAs can be taken as a measure of the social welfare, which finesses these difficulties 
  to a considerable extent. There remain, however, issues that cannot be fully 
  addressed in this WTP&#150;WTA framework, most important of which are equity 
  and sustainability.</p>
<p>The above analysis of welfare focuses on the narrowly economic dimension. Even 
  within this framework there are complexities that make a full assessment difficult. 
  In addition, however, issues of DES need to be taken into account.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a></p>
<p>A key question in broadening the analysis of costs to cover these dimensions 
  is whether they can be measured in the same units as the costs (i.e., in money). 
  The authors take the view that the methods to &#147;convert&#148; some of these 
  other dimensions into monetary terms are useful and should be pursued. These 
  are discussed further in <a href="277.htm">Section 7.2.3</a>. At the same time, 
  there is some controversy about the measurement of equity, of environmental 
  impacts and sustainability in monetary terms, as, for example, in the discussion 
  on social cost-benefit analysis in Ray (1984).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>2</sup></small></a> 
  This is because of disagreement about what values should be attached to physical 
  and social changes that are of interest. Furthermore, it is generally accepted 
  that not all these impacts can be put in monetary terms.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>3</sup></small></a> 
  Hence it is important, indeed imperative, that the cost methodology be supplemented 
  by a broader assessment of the impacts with physical values reported wherever 
  possible. These questions are discussed further in <a href="283.htm">Sections 
  7.3</a> and <a href="295.htm">7.4</a>.</p>
