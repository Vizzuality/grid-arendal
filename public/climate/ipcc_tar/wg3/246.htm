<h2>6.3 International Policies, Measures, and Instruments </h2>
<p>Although only Annex I Parties that have made commitments under the Kyoto Protocol&#146;s 
  Annex B have quantified emissions limitations, all Parties have committed to 
  take climate change considerations into account, to the extent feasible, in 
  their relevant social, economic, and environmental policies and actions (UNFCCC, 
  1992, Article 4.1.f). It is recognized, however, that non-Annex I Parties&#146; 
  efforts to take actions that contribute to national development and GHG emissions 
  reduction may be limited by capital constraints, lack of knowledge, or other 
  factors. The UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, therefore, include several provisions 
  that can help overcome such barriers, such as the provision that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All Parties are &#147;committed to promote and co-operate in the development, 
    application and diffusion, including transfer, of technologies, practices 
    and processes that control, reduce or prevent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse 
    gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol in all relevant sectors, including 
    the energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste management 
    sectors&#148; (UNFCCC, 1992, Article 4.1.c).</li>
  <li>Parties agreed to establish a financial mechanism &#147;for the provision 
    of financial resources on a grant or concessional basis, including for the 
    transfer of technology&#148; (UNFCCC, 1992, Article 11.1).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally,</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#147;The CDM created by the Kyoto Protocol creates an incentive for (entities 
    in and governments of) Annex I Parties to assist the development and implementation 
    of climate change mitigation projects that contribute to sustainable development 
    in, and are approved by, a non-Annex I Party&#148; (UNFCCC, 1997, Article 
    12).</li>
</ul>
<p>This section discusses the three Kyoto mechanisms: international emissions 
  trading (IET) (Article 17) in <a href="246.htm#631">Section 6.3.1</a> (for some 
  clarifying remarks, see also <a href="227.htm">Section 6.1.3</a>), and JI (Article 
  6) and the CDM (Article 12) in <a href="247.htm">Section 6.3.2</a>. Thereafter, 
  the section deals with international transfers (<a href="249.htm">Section 6.3.3</a>) 
  and with the various other international policies, measures, and instruments 
  (<a href="251.htm">Section 6.3.4</a>).</p>
<h3><a name="631"></a>6.3.1 International Emissions Trading</h3>
<p>If the Kyoto Protocol comes into force Annex I Parties will have agreed to 
  an allocation of AAs (here also called emission quotas) of GHG emissions for 
  the first commitment period, 2008 to 2012. Article 17 of the Protocol allows 
  them to trade part of these emission quotas among themselves in accordance with 
  rules currently being negotiated.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#59","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>59</sup></small></a></p>
<p>IET implies that countries with high marginal abatement costs (MACs) may acquire 
  emission reductions from countries with low MACs. In principle, such trading 
  tends to equalize MACs across these countries, so that an aggregate emissions 
  reduction can be attained cost-effectively.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#60","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>60</sup></small></a> 
  Parties have not yet decided whether IET based on Article 17 will be restricted 
  to governments or whether legal entities also will be allowed to participate 
  with the approval of their national governments. To support compliance with 
  their AAs after adjusting for trading, governments may use any of the domestic 
  policy instruments discussed in <a href="231.htm">Section 6.2</a> above.</p>
<p>Limiting all transactions to multilateral and potentially anonymous trade on 
  an exchange would help IET move in the direction of becoming efficient and non-discriminatory. 
  Bilateral trading cannot be relied upon to reveal to others the true full transaction 
  prices (including undisclosed side-payments), which is required to give all 
  participants equal access to gains from trade. Non-anonymous trading may eliminate 
  transactions between Parties who are in conflict with each other, thus reducing 
  market efficiency. Transparent, anonymous, and efficient trading would be possible 
  on a continuous stock-exchange kind of market (Bohm, 1998). The scope for the 
  exertion of market power is small on such markets, contributing to efficiency 
  (Smith and Williams, 1982).</p>
<p>According to Article 17 in the Protocol, &#147;any such trading shall be supplemental 
  to domestic actions for the purpose of meeting quantified emission limitation 
  and reduction commitments.&#148; How to implement this provision is still under 
  debate.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#61","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>61</sup></small></a> 
  A restriction on free IET as a result of binding supplementarity requirements 
  could prohibit equalization of the MACs across participating countries, and 
  hence increase aggregate abatement costs.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#62","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>62</sup></small></a></p>
<p>It has also been argued that constraints on the use of IET and the project-based 
  Kyoto mechanisms (see also <a href="247.htm">Section 6.3.2</a>) might accelerate 
  technological innovation in Annex I countries by increasing the relative price 
  of alternative options for carbon mitigation. Limited analytical studies are 
  inconclusive as to whether such constraints will induce significant innovation, 
  but do suggest that they could reduce the flow of technology to other countries.</p>
<p>An initial quota allocation that turns out to exceed a baseline projection 
  for a country&#146;s emissions&#150;possibly relevant for some signatories of 
  the Kyoto Protocol with substantial changes in political and economic systems 
  since 1990&#150;implies that sales of AA units (AAUs) will exceed emission reductions 
  because of active climate mitigation policies, sometimes referred to as &#147;hot 
  air&#148;. Restricting trade of &#147;hot air&#148;, as some Parties have proposed, 
  would force larger reductions in emissions by countries that would otherwise 
  import emissions quotas during the first commitment period.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#63","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>63</sup></small></a> 
  In addition, constraints on hot-air trading, other things being equal, would 
  make the Protocol less beneficial for some countries with &#147;hot air&#148; 
  allocations (Bohm, 1999).</p>
<p>Emissions trading creates a risk that sellers of AAUs might not undertake the 
  emissions reductions that their sales require, in spite of the political costs 
  of non-compliance and despite the sanctions to be instituted. Several options 
  that provide Annex I Parties with an incentive to transfer only part of their 
  AAUs that are surplus to their compliance needs are under consideration. Such 
  options, called liability provisions, are discussed in <a href="255.htm">Section 
  6.3.5.3</a>. Liability provisions are intended to enhance environmental integrity 
  and are also necessary for the functioning of the market.</p>
