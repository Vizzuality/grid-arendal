<h4>5.3.6.2 Achievement of Socioeconomic Potential </h4>
<p><i>Vested Interests</i><b> </b><br>
  Organizations provide not only public goods to their members but also selective 
  incentives, i.e., private goods. These selective incentives may be sufficient 
  to maintain the organization even if the public good it once provided is no 
  longer needed. Organizations that represent a narrow segment of society do not 
  have an incentive to increase society&#146;s output, but rather to increase 
  the share of output going to its members. These organizations are themselves 
  barriers by being rent-seeking coalitions which reduce efficiency and output, 
  and increase the political divisiveness of society. Rent-seeking coalitions 
  interfere with an economy&#146;s capacity to change because of their slow decision-making 
  processes, and because they increase the complexity of regulation and the role 
  of government (Olson, 1982). </p>
<p>A major barrier to the diffusion of technical progress appears to lie in the 
  existence of vested interests among economic agents specialized in the old technologies 
  and who may, therefore, be tempted to collude and exert political pressure on 
  governments to impose administrative procedures, taxes, trade barriers, and 
  regulations in order to delay or even prevent the arrival of new innovations 
  that might destroy their rents (Olson, 1982). The duration of the delay will 
  depend in part on the design of political institutions and in part on technological 
  characteristics (learning by doing and knowledge externalities), and on the 
  balance of power between innovators and incumbents. The more learning by doing 
  and the more positive knowledge externalities on the older technology, other 
  things being equal, the lower the frequency of new innovations (Jovanovic and 
  Nyarko, 1994; Krusell and Rios-Rull, 1996; Aghion and Howitt, 1998).</p>
<p><i>Firms&#146; Institutional Structures</i><b> </b><br>
  Firms&#146; institutional structures shape their responses to technological 
  opportunities and policies. Firms that tend to maximize stability and tend to 
  rely on single&#150;source internal analyses for information are the least likely 
  to be first adopters of a new technology. On the other hand, firms that maximize 
  profitability, and rely on multiple internal and external sources of information 
  were most likely to experiment with a variety of technologies, but unlikely 
  to commit themselves to a single fuel or process (Braid et al., 1986; O&#146;Riordan 
  et al., 1998). A vertically integrated firm may be slower to absorb information 
  and respond to change than a firm where lateral transfers are possible (&#147;smart 
  workplaces&#148;). An integrated firm also has less incentive to innovate than 
  a decentralized one (&#147;Arrow replacement effect&#148;). On the other hand, 
  as a lot of climate change innovation research is of an applied nature, research 
  is more productive when it is carried out by the firm itself than when delegated 
  to a research institution. Delegation of the research function to a specific 
  entity within the firm increases the incentive to acquire information, but also 
  increases the probability of getting a suboptimal innovation (Aghion and Howitt, 
  1998; DeCanio, 1998).</p>
<p><i>Inadequate Attention to Institutional Design</i><b> </b><br>
  This lack of attention, for example, is especially connected to the institutional 
  context (&#147;national innovation system&#148;) for the heuristic search which 
  gives rise to a set of new findings, blueprints, artifacts (&#147;selection 
  environment&#148;), and which may yield a protected space (&#147;niche&#148;) 
  in which a new product can survive more easily because of technology forcing. 
  A national innovation system provides long-term goals, predictions of long&#150;run 
  outcomes, creation of an actors&#146; network, adequate experimentation, and 
  monitoring of outcomes, formulation of standards, tax and subsidies, etc. for 
  alternative energy technologies (Freeman and Soete, 1997; Rip and Kemp, 1998). 
</p>
<p>National policy styles, as routinized institutional methods to deal with issues, 
  in which the balance of authority is shifted from formal institutions toward 
  informal networks and associations may help achieve economic potential. This 
  shift favours the development of innovative policy formulation, and implementation 
  (Wynne, 1993; O&#146;Riordan et al., 1998).</p>
<p><i>Lack of Effective Regulatory Agencies</i><b> </b><br>
  Many developing countries have excellent constitutional and legal provisions 
  for environmental protection but the latter are not enforced (O&#146;Riordan 
  et al., 1998). However, &#147;informal regulation&#148; under community pressure 
  from e.g., non-governmental organizations, trade unions, neighbourhood organizations, 
  etc. may substitute for formal regulatory pressure (Pargal and Wheeler, 1996). 
  Informal regulation is correlated with the adoption of clean technologies (Blackman 
  and Bannister, 1998). Differences in regulatory costs between the old and the 
  new technologies affect the rate of return on the new technology and the speed 
  of diffusion of technologies (Millman and Prince, 1989; Ecchia and Mariotti, 
  1994).</p>
<p><i>Reliance on Market Mechanisms when Inappropriate</i><b> </b><br>
  Organizations co-ordinate behaviour by promulgating standards and rules, and 
  by offering certification that allows actors to formulate stable expectations 
  about the environment and about the behaviour of other actors. Markets perform 
  such functions incompletely or not at all. Thus, reliance on market mechanisms, 
  to the exclusion of the development of organizations needed to perform standard-setting 
  and other co-ordination functions limits the spread of new technology by increasing 
  uncertainty and preventing the realization of co-ordination benefits. </p>
