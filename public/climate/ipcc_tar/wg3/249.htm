<h3>6.3.3 Direct International Transfers </h3>
<p>The UNFCCC states that Annex II Parties (basically Annex I Parties except for 
  the Parties in Central and Eastern Europe) shall provide new and additional 
  financial resources, including the transfer of technology, needed by the developing 
  country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures 
  taken under the Convention and that are agreed between a developing country 
  Party and the international entity or entities referred to in Article 11 of 
  the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, 1997, Article 11). So, the extent to which developing 
  country Parties effectively implement their commitments under the Convention 
  will depend on the effective implementation by developed country Parties of 
  their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer 
  of technology.</p>
<h4><a name="6331"></a>6.3.3.1 Financial Resources</h4>
<p>Sustainable development requires increased investment, for which domestic and 
  external financial resources are needed, particularly for developing countries 
  (UN, 1992, Agenda 21, Chapter 34). In its Resolution 44/228 of 1989 giving a 
  mandate to the convening of the UN Conference on Environment and Development 
  (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, the UN General Assembly notes, <i>inter alia</i>: &#147;that 
  the largest part of current emission of pollutants into the environment originates 
  in developed countries, and therefore recognizes that those countries have the 
  main responsibility for combating such pollution&#148;, and that &#147;new and 
  additional financial resources will have to be channelled to developing countries 
  in order to ensure their full participation in global efforts for environmental 
  protection.&#148; Developed country Parties reaffirmed their commitments in 
  the related provisions of the Kyoto Protocol. &#147;The implementation of these 
  existing commitments shall take into account the need for adequacy and predictability 
  in the flow of funds and the importance of appropriate burden sharing among 
  developed country Parties&#148; (UNFCCC, 1997, Article 11).</p>
<p>Accordingly, Agenda 21 (UN, 1992, Chapter 33, especially its 15th Section) 
  carries the consensus formulation that for developing countries: &#147;ODA is 
  a main source of external funding, and substantial new and additional funding 
  for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 will be required.&#148; 
  In practice, however, there has been a clear trend of a continuing decline in 
  ODA levels since UNCED. Total ODA dropped from 0.35% of total gross national 
  product of the developed countries in 1991 to 0.29% in 1995, with further declines 
  in 1996 and 1997 (OECD, 1998c). Some developed countries are contributing to 
  solving the environmental problems that developing countries face with financial 
  resources other than ODA. For instance, the Japanese government is implementing 
  the Green Aid Plan that aims to achieve both economic development and environmental 
  protection in developing countries in Asia. Most developing countries maintain 
  that a sufficient level of financial resources is key to effective implementation 
  of Agenda 21 and is a priority issue to be resolved to enable the implementation 
  of the global consensus reached at the UNCED.</p>
