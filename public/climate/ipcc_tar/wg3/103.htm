<h4>3.4.4.8 Waterborne Transport</h4>
<p>Opportunities for reducing energy use and GHG emissions from waterborne transport 
  were not covered in the SAR. The predominant propulsion system for waterborne 
  transport is the diesel engine. Worldwide, 98% of freighters are powered by 
  diesels. Although the 2% powered by steam electric drive tend to be the largest 
  ships and account for 17% of gross tonnage, most are likely to be replaced by 
  diesels within the next 10 years (Michaelis, 1997). Still, diesel fuel accounted 
  for only 21% of international marine bunker fuel consumed in 1995 (Olivier and 
  Peters, 1999). Modern marine diesel engines are capable of average operating 
  efficiencies of 42% from fuel to propeller, making them already one of the most 
  efficient propulsion systems. The best modern low-speed diesels can realize 
  efficiencies exceeding 50% (Farrell <i>et al</i>., 2000). </p>
<p>Fuel cells might be even more efficient, however, and might possibly be operated 
  on fuels containing less carbon (Interlaboratory Working Group, Appendix C, 
  1999). Design studies suggest that molten carbonate fuel cell systems might 
  achieve energy conversion efficiencies of 54%, and possibly 64% by adding a 
  steam turbine bottoming cycle. These studies do not consider full fuel cycle 
  emissions, however. Farrell <i>et al</i>. (2000) estimated the cost of eliminating 
  carbon emissions from marine freight by producing hydrogen from fossil fuel, 
  sequestering the carbon, and powering ships by solid oxide or molten carbonate 
  fuel cells at US$218/tC, though there is much uncertainty about costs at this 
  time.</p>
<p>A number of improvements can be made to conventional diesel vessels in, (1) 
  the thermal efficiency of marine propulsion (5%&#150;10%); (2) propeller design 
  and maintenance (2%&#150;8%); (3) hydraulic drag reduction (10%); (4) ship size; 
  (5) speed (energy use increases to the third power of speed); (6) increased 
  load factors; and (7) new propulsion systems, such as underwater foils or wings 
  to harness wave energy (12%&#150;64%) (CAE, 1996). More intelligent weather 
  routing and adaptive autopilot control systems might save another 4%&#150;7% 
  (Interlaboratory Working Group, Appendix C, 1999). </p>

<h4>3.4.4.9 Truck Freight</h4>
<p>Modern heavy trucks are equipped with turbo-charged direct-injection diesel 
  engines. The best of these engines achieve 45% thermal efficiency, versus 24% 
  for spark-ignited gasoline engines (Interlaboratory Working Group, 1997). Still, 
  there are opportunities for energy efficiency improvements and also for lower 
  carbon alternative fuels, such as compressed or liquified natural gas in certain 
  applications. By a combination of strategies, increased peak pressure, insulation 
  of combustion chambers, recovery of waste heat, and friction reduction, thermal 
  efficiencies of 55% might be achievable, though there are unresolved questions 
  about nitrogen oxide emissions (US DOE/OHT, 1996). For medium-heavy trucks used 
  in short distance operations, hybridization may be an attractive option. Fuel 
  economy improvements of 60%-75% have been estimated for smaller trucks with 
  5-7 litre engines (An <i>et al</i>., 1999). With drag coefficients of 0.6 to 0.9, heavy 
  trucks are much less aerodynamic than light-duty vehicles with typical drag 
  coefficients of 0.2 to 0.4. Other potential sources of fuel economy improvement 
  include lower rolling resistance tyres and reduced tare weight. The sum total 
  of all such improvements has been estimated to have the potential to improve 
  heavy truck fuel economy by 60% over current levels (Interlaboratory Working 
  Group, 2000).</p>

<h4>3.4.4.10 Systems Approaches to Sustainability</h4>
<p>Recognizing the growing levels of external costs produced by the continuing 
  growth of motorized transport, cities and nations around the world have begun 
  to develop plans for achieving sustainable transport. A recent report by the 
  ECMT (1995) presents three policy &#147;strands&#148;, describing a progression 
  of scenarios intended to lead from the status quo to sustainability. The first 
  strand represents &#147;best practice&#148; in urban transport policy, combining 
  land-use management strategies (such as zoning restrictions on low-density development 
  and parking area controls) with advanced road traffic management strategies, 
  environmental protection strategies (such as tighter pollutant emissions regulations 
  and fuel economy standards), and pricing mechanisms (such as motor fuel taxes, 
  parking charges, and road tolls). Even with these practices, transport-related 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were projected to increase by about one-third in OECD countries 
  over the next 20 years and by twice that amount over the next 30 to 40 years. 
  A second strand added significant investment in transit, pedestrian, and bicycle 
  infrastructure to shape land use along with stricter controls on development, 
  limits on road construction plus city-wide traffic calming, promotion of clean 
  fuels and the setting of air quality goals for cities, as well as congestion 
  pricing for roads and user subsidies for transit. The addition of this strand 
  was projected to reduce the growth in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from transport to a 20% 
  increase over the next 20 years. The third strand added steep year-by-year increases 
  in the price of fuel, full-cost externality pricing for motor vehicles (estimated 
  at 5% of GDP in OECD countries), and ensuring the use of high-efficiency, low-weight, 
  low-polluting cars, vans, lorries, and buses in cities. Addition of the third 
  strand was projected to reduce fuel use by 40% from 1995 to 2015.</p>
