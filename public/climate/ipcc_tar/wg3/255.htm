<h4>6.3.5.3 Liability </h4>
<p>Liability provisions prescribe how quotas transferred by a party that subsequently 
  is not in compliance with its emissions limitation commitment are treated. Since 
  the developing country hosts of CDM projects do not have emissions limitation 
  commitments, this is not an issue for CERs once they have been certified and 
  issued by the operational entity or the Executive Board. However, this does 
  not deal with the question of what happens if the certification has not been 
  undertaken to acceptable standards or if there are other significant irregularities 
  in issuance procedures. Since both JI and IET involve only Parties with emissions 
  limitation commitments, treatment of quotas traded using these mechanisms must 
  be addressed if the issuer does not achieve compliance.</p>
<p>With regard to JI, Article 6.4 of the Kyoto Protocol specifies that if compliance 
  by an Annex I country is questioned under Article 8, any ERUs acquired from 
  that country cannot be used to meet the buyer&#146;s commitments under Article 
  3, until the question of non-compliance by the originating country is satisfactorily 
  resolved (UNFCCC, 1997).</p>
<p>If the ERUs issued for JI projects are determined by an international review 
  process, they reflect corresponding reductions of the host country&#146;s emissions 
  and hence do not contribute to its non-compliance. However, if the decision 
  on the quantity of ERUs issued is left to the host government and the penalties 
  for non-compliance are weak or not effectively enforced, JI projects could contribute 
  to non-compliance by the host country. Since any ERUs transferred must be deducted 
  from the party&#146;s AA, they could be made subject to the liability provisions 
  for IET.</p>
<p>Article 17 does not include any provisions to deal with quotas that have been 
  transferred by a country that subsequently fails to meet its emissions limitation 
  commitment. A number of options and variants have been proposed in the literature 
  (Goldberg <i>et al</i>., 1998; Grubb <i>et al</i>., 1998; Haites, 1998; Baron, 1999; Zhang, 
  1999b). The proposals reflect various strategies, including seller and (its 
  opposite) buyer liability, eligibility requirements for buyer and sellers, limits 
  on the quantity of quota that can be sold, limiting sales to quantities surplus 
  to estimated or actual compliance needs, or restoration of default. These approaches 
  can be grouped into those that aim to prevent or limit the risk of non-compliance, 
  and those designed to provide sufficient deterrence (either requiring the defaulting 
  party to face the regimes&#146; non-compliance system or else harnessing the 
  market to discount quotas from those Parties considered to be most at risk). 
</p>
<p>These liability proposals differ in terms of their environmental effectiveness, 
  impact on compliance costs of Annex I Parties, and market liquidity. The proposals 
  can change the ratio of domestic reductions to purchased quotas used for compliance 
  and the mix of quotas purchased. In this way they can change the distribution 
  of costs across countries, including non-Annex I countries through the volume 
  of CDM activity. In policy terms, it is likely that the most effective strategy 
  would aim to combine one or more of them. Details of how this may be undertaken, 
  as well as on how many of the proposals would be implemented in practice, are 
  currently subject to international negotiations.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#79","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>79</sup></small></a></p>
