<h2>2.2 Scenarios </h2>
<a name="221"></a> 
<h3>2.2.1 Introduction to Scenarios</h3>
<p>Climate change assessment addresses a highly complex set of interactions between 
  human and natural systems, a scientific challenge that is compounded by the 
  cumulative and long-term character of the phenomenon. While the world of many 
  decades from now is indeterminate, scenarios offer a structured means of organizing 
  information and gleaning insight into the possibilities. Scenarios can draw 
  on both science and imagination to articulate a spectrum of plausible visions 
  of the future and pathways of development. Some scenarios are assumed to evolve 
  gradually and continuously from current social, economic, and environmental 
  patterns and trends; others deviate in fundamental ways. A long view of a multiplicity 
  of future possibilities is required to consider the ultimate risks of climate 
  change, assess critical interactions with other aspects of human and environmental 
  systems, and guide policy responses. </p>
<p>The term &#147;scenarios&#148; appears in two distinct streams of inquiry, 
  one based on qualitative narrative and the other on mathematical models. Qualitative 
  scenarios are primarily literary exercises, aimed at holistic and integrated 
  sketches of future visions and compelling accounts of a progression of events 
  that might lead to those futures. Quantitative, formal models seek mathematical 
  representation of key features of human and/or environmental systems in order 
  to represent the evolution of the system under alternative assumptions, such 
  as population, economic growth, technological change, and environmental sensitivity. 
  Qualitative scenarios have a greater power to posit system shifts, to explore 
  the implications of surprise, and to include critical factors that defy quantification, 
  such as values, cultural shifts, and institutional features. On the other hand, 
  qualitative scenarios may appear arbitrary, idiosyncratic, and weakly supported. 
  Model-based scenarios are useful for examining futures that result from variations 
  of quantitative-driving variables, and they offer a systematic and replicable 
  basis for analysis. </p>
<p>A first wave of global assessments began in the 1970s. Ambitious global modelling 
  exercises aimed to forecast the behaviour over many decades of development, 
  resource, and environmental systems, and to assess resource constraints (Meadows 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1972; Mesarovic and Pestel, 1974). The Latin American world model 
  stressed social and political concerns, rather than physical limits, by positing 
  a normative egalitarian future to examine the actions required to achieve it 
  (Herrera <i>et al.</i>, 1976). A second wave of integrated global scenario analyses 
  responded to new concerns about sustainable development and the future (WCED, 
  1987). Many of these were in the qualitative tradition (Svedin and Aniansson, 
  1987; Toth <i>et al.</i>, 1989; Milbrath, 1989; Burrows <i>et al.</i>, 1991; 
  Kaplan, 1994; Gallopin <i>et al.</i>, 1997; WBCSD, 1997; Bossel, 1998). In addition, 
  stimulated largely by the climate issue, there have been a number of new models 
  that quantitatively link energy and other human activities to atmospheric, oceanic, 
  and terrestrial systems (e.g., Rotmans and de Vries, 1997). Finally, scenario 
  studies have begun recently to synthesize the modelling and qualitative approaches, 
  in order to blend structured quantitative analysis with textured and pluralistic 
  scenario narratives (Raskin <i>et al.</i>, 1998; Nakicenovic <i>et al.</i>, 
  2000).</p>
<p>IPCC GHG emission scenarios were prepared for the first assessment report of 
  1990. These initial scenarios were updated and extended, and led to the publication 
  in 1992 of alternative emissions scenarios for the period 1990 through 2100 
  (Leggett <i>et al.</i>, 1992; Pepper <i>et al.</i>, 1992). These so-called IS92 
  emission scenarios were used by the IPCC to assess changes in atmospheric composition 
  and climate over this time horizon. Analysts have used the IS92 scenarios, and 
  particularly IS92a, as the preferred reference scenarios for mitigation and 
  stabilization studies. A subsequent IPCC evaluation of the IS92 scenarios (Alcamo 
  <i>et al.</i>, 1995) found that for the purposes of driving atmospheric and 
  climate models, the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions trajectories of 
  the IS92 scenarios provided a reasonable reflection of variations found in the 
  open literature. However, the review found that these scenarios should not be 
  used for evaluating the consequences of interventions to reduce GHG emissions 
  since the scenarios have insufficient sectoral and regional detail for careful 
  analyses. This review also took into account criticism by Parikh (1992) who 
  suggested the need for a more coherent approach and scenarios that show improved 
  equity between the developed and the developing countries.</p>
<p>The 1995 review also emphasized the need for analysts to consider the full 
  range of IS92 emissions scenarios, rather than a single &#147;business-as-usual&#148; 
  reference scenario. The uncertainties in long-range future assumptions make 
  the assignation of a most-probable trajectory problematic. </p>
<p>In 1996, the IPCC initiated a process for establishing a new set of reference 
  emissions scenarios. The new scenarios are described in the IPCC Special Report 
  on Emissions Scenarios (Nakicenovic <i>et al.</i>, 2000). These are designed 
  to be non-mitigation or reference scenarios, that is, scenarios in which additional 
  policy initiatives aimed specifically at lowering GHG emissions are assumed 
  to be absent. </p>

<p><a name="fig21"></a>Owing to fundamental uncertainties, it is impossible to 
  predict or forecast the long-range global future, even with the most sophisticated 
  methods. Long-range indeterminism implies that </p>
<p>probabilities cannot be rigorously assigned for either a given set of driving 
  assumptions or the likelihood of structural shifts in societies a</p>
<p>nd natural systems. Consequently, instead of a single &#147;business as usual&#148; 
  scenario, multiple baseline scenarios are needed to scan a spectrum of plausible 
  possibilities in order to guide the formulation of robust policies that are 
  not geared to an overly rigid sense of where the world is heading. </p>
<p>To account for the wide variety of possible futures and the large uncertainties 
  involved in such forward projections, the SRES team opted for a multiple baseline 
  approach.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>2</sup></small></a> 
  It also decided to fuse a qualitative, narrative approach with a more formal 
  approach with different models, to guarantee structural variance and methodological 
  diversity in the scenarios. As such, the SRES-scenarios combine elements from 
  both the more story-like scenarios discussed in <a href="077.htm#24">Section 
  2.4</a> below, and the more model-based scenarios discussed in <a href="073.htm#23">Section 
  2.3</a>. The relationship between these three kinds of scenarios is shown in 
  <a href="#fig21">Figure 2.1</a>.</p>
