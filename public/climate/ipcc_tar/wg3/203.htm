<h4>5.3.8.6 Ethics of GHG Mitigation: the Commons Dilemma </h4>
<p>There are several important ethical dilemmas both in the public discourse and 
  in most people&#146;s minds regarding GHG mitigation. Essentially, they boil 
  down to questions about human relationship with nature, about justice and equity 
  between human beings, and about the nature of the &#147;good life&#148; (Michaelis, 
  2000b). In modern society, images of and narratives about the good life often 
  emphasize individual independence and material well-being. These values may 
  appear to conflict with messages about the interdependence of people around 
  the world and the need to moderate the consumption of natural resources.</p>
<p>In addition to the perceived conflict with improving material wellbeing, ethical 
  arguments for GHG mitigation face several barriers including the perceived weakness 
  of the evidence that climate change is happening; the difficulty in understanding 
  the risks associated with low-probability extreme weather events; the difficulty 
  in tracing climate change impacts to particular emitters of GHGs; and the large 
  physical and social distance between GHG emitters and victims of climate change 
  (Pawlik, 1991). It seems that people are inclined to deny and remain passive 
  about about those kinds of environmental nuisances and risks that they believe 
  to be uncontrollable (Pawlik, 1990). From an institutional perspective, the 
  &#147;commons&#148; dilemma charaterizes situations in which people are unable 
  to co-operate to achieve collective benefits, because they are unable to change 
  the rules affecting their perverse incentives; these incentives are themselves 
  institution-dependent (Ostrom, 1990; Ostrom <i>et al</i>., 1993). Current climate may 
  be seen as an infrastructure which is used jointly by many people, which is 
  subject to many decision makers, including some in the public sector, and whose 
  benefits and costs are perceived differently by different people because these 
  are borne by many people who do not take the protection decisions. Lack of clear 
  limits on using up resources such as current climate generates costs (climate 
  change) on all participants through unsustainable exploitation because GHG concentrations 
  and, therefore, current climate are stocks like fish and timber. Complex institutional 
  arrangements are required to overcome perverse incentives (Ostrom <i>et al</i>., 1993). 
  Commons dilemmas reflect persistent conflicts among (not between) many individuals 
  (producers and consumers).</p>
