<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly established 
  by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment 
  Programme (UNEP) in 1988. The terms of reference include: (i) to assess available 
  scientific and socio-economic information on climate change and its impacts 
  and on the options for mitigating climate change and adapting to it and (ii) 
  to provide, on request, scientific/ technological/socio-economic advice to the 
  Conference of the Parties (CoP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
  Climate Change (UNFCCC). From 1990, the IPCC has produced a series of Assessment 
  Reports, Special Reports, Technical Papers, methodologies and other products 
  that have become standard works of reference, widely used by policymakers, scientists 
  and other experts.<br>
</p>
<p>This volume, which forms part of the Third Assessment Report (TAR), has been 
  produced by Working Group III (WGIII) of the IPCC and focuses on the mitigation 
  of climate change. It consists of 10 chapters covering the technological and 
  biological options to mitigate climate change, their costs and ancillary benefits, 
  the barriers to their implementation, and policies, measures and instruments 
  to overcome these barriers. As is usual in the IPCC, success in producing this 
  report has depended first and foremost on the knowledge, enthusiasm and co-operation 
  of many hundreds of experts worldwide, in many related but different disciplines. 
  We would like to express our gratitude to all the Co-ordinating Lead Authors, 
  Lead Authors, Contributing Authors, Review Editors and Reviewers. These individuals 
  have devoted enormous time and effort to produce this report and we are extremely 
  grateful for their commitment to the IPCC process. We would like to thank the 
  staff of the WGIII Technical Support Unit (TSU) and the IPCC Secretariat for 
  their dedication in co-ordinating the production of another successful IPCC 
  report. We are also grateful to the governments, who have supported their scientists&#146; 
  participation in the IPCC process and who have contributed to the IPCC Trust 
  Fund to provide for the essential participation of experts from developing countries 
  and countries with economies in transition. We would like to express our appreciation 
  to the governments of The Netherlands, Norway, Germany and South Africa, who 
  hosted drafting sessions in their countries, to the government of Ghana, who 
  hosted the 6th session of Working Group III for official consideration and acceptance 
  of the report in Accra, and again to the government of The Netherlands, who 
  funded the WGIII Technical Support Unit.<br>
</p>
<p>We would particularly like to thank Dr. Robert Watson, Chairman of the IPCC, 
  for his sound direction and tireless and able guidance of the IPCC, to Dr. Sundararaman, 
  the Secretary of the IPCC and his staff for the secretarial support, and Professor 
  Ogunlade Davidson and Dr. Bert Metz, the Co-Chairmen of Working Group III, for 
  their skilful leadership of Working Group III through the production of this 
  report.<br>
