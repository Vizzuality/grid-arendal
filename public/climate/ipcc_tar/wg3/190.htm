<h3>5.3.3 Financing </h3>
<p>Many environmentally beneficial technologies require significant &#147;up-front&#148; 
  investment. This investment will be typically offset, over time, by the environmental 
  benefits, out-of-pocket cost savings, or financial revenues associated with 
  the new technology. There are, however, many circumstances where users are unable 
  to purchase equipment that is financially viable to them or beneficial to the 
  society, simply because they do not have access to the private or government 
  investment funds necessary to install the equipment. To the extent that private 
  entities are not willing to provide funds to implement investments that are 
  financially viable and in addition reduce GHG emissions, they constitute failures 
  of capital and financial markets that must be overcome to reach the level of 
  economic potential. In contrast to private financiers, who are primarily concerned 
  about the risk-adjusted financial return, governments are expected to evaluate 
  desirability of investments in a wider context of the well-being of the whole 
  society, including harms and benefits that some entities impose on others. To 
  the extent that governments are not willing to finance investments that are 
  socially desirable thanks to climate and other environmental benefits, they 
  constitute policy failures that prevents achievement of socioeconomic potential. 
  All these market and policy failures are aggravated in developing countries 
  and low income transition economies, where they interact with poverty and capital 
  constraints.</p>
<p><i>Commercial Banks</i><br>
  Notwithstanding the significant potential as a supplier of investment capital 
  for climate-friendly technology transfer, commercial banks thus far have not 
  developed large portfolios of environmental loans (Delphi Int. Ltd. and Ecologic 
  GMBH, 1997). Banks face high up-front cost of developing new, &#147;green&#148; 
  financial products (e.g., energy-efficiency loans). To bear these costs is often 
  perceived risky by the bankers, given uncertain and policy-dependent future 
  market conditions. Relatively low capital requirements and the long-term cash-flow 
  profile of many climate friendly investments, as well as high transaction costs 
  of servicing large numbers of small and medium-sized projects, further reduce 
  comparative attractiveness of this sector to the commercial banks (Berry, 1995). 
  Technologies such as energy efficiency or public transport often have low collateral 
  value compared to their traditional alternatives, making it difficult for the 
  banks to use some financing instruments such as project finance.</p>
<p>Even if the size of the loan for manufacturing or distributing climate friendly 
  technologies would justify the attention of bankers, the debt carrying capacity 
  of such projects hinges upon the availability of financing for the end users, 
  e.g., households to enable them to purchase those technologies. These down-stream 
  projects most often require completely different financial products, which commercial 
  banks are often not able to offer (e.g., micro-credits or grants to low income 
  households with no assets).</p>
<p>Different energy producers and consumers have varying access to capital in 
  financial markets, and at different rates of interest. In general, energy suppliers 
  can obtain capital at lower interest rates than can energy consumers &#150; 
  thus, an &#147;interest rate gap&#148;. Differences in these borrowing rates 
  may reflect differences in the knowledge base of lenders about the likely performance 
  of investments, as well as the financial risk of the potential borrower. At 
  one extreme, electric and gas utilities are able to borrow money at low interest 
  rates. At the other extreme, low-income households may have essentially no ability 
  to borrow funds, resulting in an essentially infinite discount rate for valuing 
  improvements in energy efficiency. The broader market for energy efficiency 
  (including residential, commercial, and industrial consumers) faces interest 
  rates available for efficiency purchases that are also much higher than the 
  utility cost of capital (Hauseman, 1979; Ruderman <i>et al</i>., 1987; Ross, 1990).</p>
<p><i>&#147;Green&#148; Financial Institutions</i><br>
  In response to the difficulties faced by the emerging environmental business 
  sector in accessing traditional financing institutions, such as banks (Asad, 
  1997), a number of innovative approaches and specialized financial institutions 
  have developed. These include environmental project finance (Stewart, 1993; 
  Shaughnessy, 1995; Davis, 1996), green investment funds, leasing (Carter, 1996), 
  environmental and ethical banks, environmental funds (OECD, 1999b), and energy 
  service companies (ESCOs). Not clearly defined property rights to GHG emitting 
  assets create obstacles to ESCOs and other similar institutions, that invest 
  in the assets of third parties and rely on a contracts with owners to recuperate 
  the return (WB and IFC, 1996). The growth of new &#147;green&#148; financial 
  institutions hinges upon the long-term market growth prospects for the environmental 
  business sector, which in turn depends fundamentally on the consistent and clear 
  commitment by governments to climate policies (Delphi Int. Ltd. and Ecologic 
  GMBH, 1997). Specific incentives, such as tax allowances, have been shown to 
  stimulate the market penetration by green investment funds in some developed 
  countries (e.g., The Netherlands).</p>
<p>In the last years of the decade sustainable forestry has started to attract 
  private finance. Some new green financial institutions have worked towards capturing 
  values of standing forests through innovative financial mechanisms. Sustainable 
  forestry has provided attractive returns relative to stock markets. Forestry 
  investment funds have typically achieved annualized returns in excess of 14% 
  over the last decade. This was in excess of the returns on the S&amp;P 500 index 
  for the equivalent period (Ecosecurities, 1999). Forestry investments had lower 
  volatility than stock markets, and could provide solid long-term returns. However, 
  to the extent that these involve wood plantation where logging is an important 
  part, the climate benefits are negligible. Managing forests and harvesting their 
  products and services efficiently significantly improves financial return to 
  the standing forests versus logging. The marketable goods and services of forests 
  include pharmaceuticals (Simpson <i>et al</i>., 1996), genetic resources (Rosenthal, 
  1997), and ecotourism (Panayotou, 1997). An important factor stimulating financial 
  viability of sustainable forestry is the move of government, world business, 
  and consumer demand towards confining wood procurement to environmentally sustainable 
  sources.</p>
<p><i>Investors</i><br>
  Individual and institutional investors send important signals to companies in 
  the pricing of new capital raised by the companies and in on-going valuation 
  of quoted companies. They can also exert direct influence by using their rights 
  as shareholders and owners. The key concern for investors is the relationship 
  between environmental performance and investment performance. Many investors 
  remain unconvinced that the present value of their portfolios may be affected 
  by the future consequences of climate change. They also are not convinced that 
  environmental performance contributes to good financial performance. </p>
<p>There is some empirical evidence, however, that investors do value environmental 
  performance of firms. Dasgupta <i>et al</i>. (1998) showed that capital markets in 
  Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and the Philippines reacted positively (increasing 
  the firms&#146; market value) to the announcement of rewards and explicit recognition 
  of superior environmental performance. They found capital markets to react negatively 
  (decreasing the firms&#146; value) to citizens&#146; complaints and to news 
  of adverse environmental incidents (such as spills or violations of permits). 
  Environmental regulators could harness market forces by introducing structured 
  programmes to release firm-specific information about environmental performance, 
  and empower communities and stakeholders through environmental education programmes. 
  Lanoie <i>et al</i>. (1997) arrived at similar conclusions, drawing on evidence from 
  American and Canadian studies. </p>
<p><i>Insurance Firms</i><br>
  The potential of the insurance sector lies in its ability to diversify its investment 
  portfolio and to have its premium structure reflect environmental risks (Delphi 
  Int. Ltd and Ecologic GMBH, 1997). The insurance industry may provide project 
  finance and insurance for preventive infrastructure projects, thereby enhancing 
  their access to finance. The insurance industry also provides strong financial 
  incentives for loss prevention and mitigation to their clients and the public, 
  e.g., by means of deductibles (UNEP, 1999). Some insurance companies have launched 
  the &#147;Insurance Industry Initiative for the Environment&#148;, in association 
  with UNEP.</p>
<p><i>User Charges</i><b> </b><br>
  Generation of revenues from the users of public infrastructure can be an important 
  source of funds for financing GHG emissions reduction in the power and district 
  heating sector and other types of GHG emission-intensive infrastructure. Covering 
  the costs of operation, maintenance, depreciation calculated according to the 
  international accounting standards, and eventually debt service for investments 
  is essential for the sustainability of infrastructure systems and important 
  for attracting multilateral development banks (MDBs) and private finance (UNIDO, 
  1996; EBRD, 1999). In low-income countries this needs to take full account of 
  affordability constraints. However, concern about the social impacts too often 
  makes the governments reluctant to adopt higher tariff levels, even though evidence 
  suggests consumers in many countries could afford and would be willing to pay 
  more for improved service (Lovei, 1995; Gentry, 1997; AFDB, 1999).</p>
<p><i>Government-created Disincentives to Private Investment</i><br>
  Government policies may themselves be a source of risk to private investments, 
  creating detrimental framework conditions for all, not only environmental, investments 
  through unstable fiscal policy and a macroeconomic environment. This leads to 
  high interest rates, elevated inflationary expectations, and fluctuating exchange 
  rates. The traditional response to these problems through fiscal consolidation 
  and tight monetary policies usually induces low liquidity in the enterprise 
  and banking sector (EBRD, 1999). This liquidity constraint may be sharpened 
  by obstacles to trade and bank credit, barriers to entry, especially for SMEs 
  and foreign firms, barriers to foreign direct investments (FDIs) and to long-term 
  foreign capital investments, all of which could otherwise relieve capital shortages 
  (EBRD, 1997b; EBRD, 1998; EBRD, 1999). Weak governance, typically manifested 
  by the lack of the rule of law, soft budget constraints, absence of competition 
  in government procurement, and corruption, may foster a perverse microeconomic 
  incentive structure that rewards private sector entities not for being competitive 
  and efficient in using resources, but rather for &#147;seeking rents&#148; through 
  friendly and not transparent relations with politicians (Gady and Ickes, 1998).</p>
<p>Governments sometimes introduce distortions directly to financial markets, 
  constraining the private lending to investments. Imprudent government borrowing 
  can raise interest rates and crowd out bank loans from the &#147;real&#148; 
  sector of the economy (OECD, 1998b). Also, excessive subsidies to environmental 
  investments may crowd out private sector financing (Peszko and Zylicz, 1998). 
  The risk of lending for investments may additionally be increased by inadequate 
  protection of creditors. This occurs when an underdeveloped legal and institutional 
  system does not make it easy for creditors to seize collateral or initiate a 
  turnover of management in the event of default. </p>
<p><i>Government-created Disincentives to Public Investments</i><br>
  Ill-designed taxation, as well as failures in budget planning and expenditure 
  control may cause fiscal imbalances and high budget deficits, which contribute 
  to high country sovereign risk, constrained access to foreign capital, and high 
  cost of borrowing by the government. Increased nominal interest rates and related 
  discount rates applied by the governments inhibit financing for most public 
  environmental investments. Budget expenditure cuts usually involve ceilings 
  for investment expenditures, while financing is made available for operation 
  of existing technologies or infrastructure. This often leads to continuing operation 
  of inefficient and polluting assets, even if their replacement through investment 
  would bring a high rate of return. </p>
<p>A barrier to efficient use of government funds is poor management of public 
  investment programmes and government budgets (OECD, 1998b). This is sometimes 
  a result of an underdeveloped civil society, and absence of government accountability 
  and transparency in budget preparation and implementation. Under these circumstances 
  budgetary spending on environmental infrastructure and biodiversity tends to 
  be neglected (OECD, 1999a; Partridge, 1996). An important opportunity to enhance 
  government spending on climate friendly investments is through revising public 
  sector expenditure choices (de Moor, 1997; Pieters, 1997). Many developing countries 
  and the countries of the former Soviet Union could help both climate and economic 
  development by phasing out ongoing subsidies to loss-making state owned, or 
  even private enterprises. </p>
<p>Central and local governments have ample opportunities to create new mechanisms 
  and new sources of finance for climate-related environmental investment (Tlaie 
  and Biller, 1994; Pearce <i>et al</i>., 1997). Budgetary resources can be used more 
  cost-effectively (Lovei, 1995) and more creatively (Clements <i>et al</i>., 1995) to 
  leverage private capitalization of public environmental investments (World Bank, 
  1994; Partridge, 1996; UNIDO, 1996; Gentry, 1997; Peszko and Zylicz, 1998). 
  Central governments can foster the use of economic instruments (tariffs, taxes, 
  fees, etc.) to achieve environmental goals while generating budgetary revenues 
  (Herber, 1997; Schlegelmilch, 1999). In the area of biodiversity pricing, instruments 
  can result in a &#147;double dividend&#148;. They can prevent the &#147;tragedy 
  of the commons&#148; by limiting otherwise open access to vulnerable natural 
  reserves. Prices also generate revenue to pay for the sustainable use of biodiversity 
  resources and for afforestation. Successful examples of these government initiatives 
  could be found in Latin America (Umana, 1996; Lopez, 1997), OECD countries (OECD, 
  1996) and Central and Eastern Europe . </p>
<p><i>Official Development Assistance</i><br>
  There is a mixed experience with donor aid programmes (Killick, 1997). Choice 
  of beneficiary countries, sectors, and types of projects by the donor governments 
  has often been driven by the geopolitical interests of donors rather than environmental 
  or global priorities in the recipient countries. Bilateral aid is often a tool 
  to support friendly regimes or strengthen the spheres of influence (Alesina 
  and Dollar, 1998). Tied aid still dominates bilateral programmes, whereby the 
  contracts are available only to firms from the donor country (Michaelowa, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Because of restrained competition tied aid may increase the costs of purchasing 
  capital or providing services anywhere from 10% to 50%, and host governments 
  are usually required to co-finance these projects. Some host governments have 
  found themselves locked in the expensive, capital intensive, and inappropriate 
  technologies that additionally created dependency for maintenance and spare 
  parts. Tied aid may distort the efficiency of technology choice, and crowd out 
  good technologies and viable business models (Graham and Hanlon, 1997). Tied 
  aid has also had an impact on GHG emission reduction projects in the context 
  of the Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) pilot phase (Michaelowa <i>et al</i>., 
  1998).</p>
<p><i>Multilateral Development Banks</i><b> </b><br>
  Sovereign guarantees required with most MDB lending involve host governments 
  in making budgetary commitments that may be difficult to attain in many low 
  income countries. Furthermore, strict adherence to sound banking principles 
  (of not lower standards than in the highest-rated private banks) poses very 
  high requirements for the internal financial viability of projects. It is not, 
  clear, however that the MDBs can do otherwise. They can provide low cost lending 
  only as a consequence of their high credit ratings. Maintenance of these high 
  ratings requires very low exposure to default risk, which in turn depends on 
  sovereign guarantees and sound financial parameters of a project.</p>
<p>Another problem with MDB loans is a longer time for and higher transaction 
  costs of project preparation relative to the typical GHG emissions reduction 
  project size. It usually takes 1.5-2 years and several hundred thousand US dollars 
  to develop a project for financing. This can only be justified if the size of 
  a project is minimum US$10-15 million. MDBs are trying to develop financial 
  products that could reach small and medium-sized environmental projects (ADB, 
  1999). Trust funds and donor grants are used to lower project preparation costs. 
  Smaller businesses are targeted trough intermediaries (local banks, leasing, 
  ESCOs, or even NGOs) which &#147;on-lend&#148; MDB loans as a package of smaller 
  financial products. Structural lending is used to finance multi-project programmes.</p>
<p>Most of the financing difficulties discussed above are most severe in developing 
  countries, where they interact with poverty to severely constrain investment 
  in GHG-efficient technology. Less developed capital and financial markets call 
  for innovative financing to enable low-income households to afford GHG-mitigating 
  technologies. This offers an important opportunity to integrate the broader 
  objectives of development, equity, and sustainability (DES).</p>
