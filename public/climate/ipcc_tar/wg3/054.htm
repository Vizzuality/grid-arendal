<h3><a name="125"></a> 1.2.5 Distributional Impacts and Equity Considerations 
</h3>
<p>It is important to consider more than the aggregate (worldwide) benefits and 
  costs of such policies in examining and evaluating mitigation options. Considerations 
  of the national, intranational, industrial, and intergenerational distributions 
  of the benefits and burdens of mitigation policies&#150;as well as considerations 
  of the historical contributions to the accumulation of GHGs&#150;are crucial 
  to develop equitable climate policies. The WGII report (IPCC, 2001) indicates 
  that the impacts of climate change vary substantially across regions of the 
  globe. Indeed, climate impacts can differ even on the scale of a few miles depending 
  on geography, terrain, and other natural conditions. The costs of the economic 
  impacts of climate policies are distributed unevenly as well, although the distribution 
  of these impacts depends on the types of mitigation policies introduced. It 
  is important to consider the distribution of cost impacts of different potential 
  policies across nations, socioeconomic groups, industrial sectors, and generations. 
</p>
<p>The distribution of the economic impacts of mitigation policies across economic 
  sectors is examined in <a href="353.htm">Chapter 9</a>. Policies such as 
  carbon taxes or carbon caps are designed to limit carbon use and are likely 
  to cause production, output, and employment to fall in the coal and oil extraction 
  industries. The impact on the natural gas industry is less clear. On the one 
  hand, a carbon tax raises the cost of supplying natural gas, which tends to 
  imply reduced demands, output, and employment in this industry. On the other 
  hand, this tax raises the price of coal by a larger percentage, inducing shifts 
  in demand from coal to natural gas. The impact of mitigation policies on renewable 
  energy sources is likely to vary by resource and region but are likely to lead 
  to larger markets for renewables. Mitigation policies are expected to lead to 
  structural changes in manufacturing, especially in the developed countries. 
  Sectors that supply energy-saving equipment and low-carbon technologies are 
  likely to benefit from these policies. Sectors that rely intensively on carbon-based 
  fuels are expected to suffer price increases and a loss of output. </p>
<p><a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> indicates results that concern the distribution 
  of impacts across household income groups. According to most studies, mitigation 
  policies that imply higher energy prices impose higher cost-burdens (relative 
  to income) on less affluent households than on richer households. This reflects 
  that the poor tend to spend a larger share of their income on energy. Equity 
  considerations suggest that mitigation policies can overcome these distributional 
  consequences by including provisions that reduce the costs they impose on the 
  lowest-income groups.</p>
<p>For the most part, existing studies of the impacts across household groups 
  (or socioeconomic groups, more broadly) apply to developed nations. There is 
  a severe need for studies that consider the distributional impacts within developing 
  countries. In addition, nearly all the studies lack the detail necessary to 
  consider impacts in socioeconomic dimensions other than income. As a result, 
  important costs to various groups within the general population may be overlooked. 
  Important costs may also be hidden by aggregation. This is especially relevant 
  in studies of the impacts of climate change and mitigation activity in developing 
  countries, since existing studies may overlook major impacts to the most vulnerable 
  individuals. <a href="056.htm">Section 1.3</a> discusses the issue of equity 
  in more detail and from a broader perspective.</p>
<h3><a name="126"></a>1.2.6 Sustainability Considerations</h3>
<p>Sustainability considerations are typically not the primary motivation for 
  studies carried out from the &#147;cost-effectiveness perspective&#148;. Besides 
  the distributional effects of climate policies, their implications for other 
  environmental concerns can also be calculated. For example, the implied impact 
  of climate policies on sulphur, particulate emissions, or land uses can be calculated. 
  Sulphur emissions in some scenarios may be so high that they have major health 
  impacts, and the land-use requirements for a global energy industry based on 
  a very large biomass could potentially crowd out agriculture, forestry, and 
  the recreational use of land. </p>
<p>As indicated in <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a>, the benefits and costs 
  from a given mitigation policy depend on the baseline circumstances to which 
  the policy is applied. The uncertainties as to what the baseline circumstances 
  might be are vast, in the light of which it is important to evaluate the impacts 
  of given policies relative to a range of baseline scenarios rather than to a 
  single baseline scenario.</p>
<p>Human welfare and the state of the environment (which may be a determinant 
  of human welfare, but one that is the focus of this assessment report) depend 
  both on the baseline path and on the policy-induced departures from the baseline. 
  A striking conclusion from <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a> is that the differences 
  in human welfare across plausible baselines can be greater than the welfare 
  impacts of mitigation policies. That is, the nature of the baseline&#150;which 
  reflects a wide range of human decisions and policies outside of the climate-policy 
  arena&#150;can be more important than the departures from that baseline caused 
  by climate policy. The lower the level of baseline GHG emissions, the smaller 
  is the effort required to achieve any specific emissions or concentration target. 
  This does not eliminate the importance of policy actions to mitigate climate 
  change, but it reveals the importance of developments that occur outside what 
  is typically regarded as &#147;climate policy&#148;.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that changes in the economy resulting from climate policy 
  may be small compared to changes that may occur in response to other trends 
  in the economy and to other policies. This is so because most the GHG emissions 
  occur in energy production, which forms a relatively low percentage of the economy 
  (no more than 5%&#150;10%). In principle, rearranging energy use as one element 
  of a mitigation strategy need not be a major shock to the economy if it is done 
  efficiently. Important also is that the costs of mitigation are likely to vary 
  substantially among nations because of both differences in baseline emissions 
  trends and differences in flexibility to accomplish the emissions reductions 
  required (see also Schneider (1998) on this subject).</p>
<p>Deciding what counts as &#147;climate policy&#148; is not always straightforward, 
  as discussed in <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a>. In many policy discussions, 
  climate-change mitigation policy is assumed to involve actions for which the 
  primary target is a reduction in GHG concentrations. These include efforts directly 
  aimed at reducing carbon emissions, at expanding carbon sinks, at reducing emissions 
  of other GHGs (like methane and nitrous oxide from agriculture), and at promoting 
  the development of new technologies and production processes that rely less 
  on carbon-based fuels (see <a href="089.htm">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="155.htm">4</a>). 
  If this is the domain of mitigation policy, then other (anticipated) actions 
  that do not fall in this category need to be regarded, by default, as part of 
  the baseline. However, other activities have important consequences for climate 
  change. For example, policies oriented towards local air pollution&#150;such 
  as controls on hydrocarbon emissions from automobiles&#150;affect levels of 
  emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> as well as the formation of tropospheric ozone, 
  and thus have consequences for climate. Moreover, as discussed below, some policies, 
  such as poverty alleviation, may ultimately have significant implications for 
  the emissions of GHGs and are therefore extremely important to climate change. 
</p>
<p>The implications of different baseline assumptions about the future of the 
  world reflect, in part, different assumptions about the sustainability of economic, 
  biological, and social systems. Bringing them to bear on the analyses of mitigation 
  opens the possibility that climate policies can be assessed within alternative 
  worlds and that how climate policies might effect various measures of sustainability 
  can be examined explicitly. This kind of analysis can support, though, only 
  a limited treatment of sustainable development. A more in-depth treatment has 
  been attempted by researchers working from the perspective of &#147;envisioning 
  transitions to sustainability&#148;; their perspective is described in <a href="061.htm">Section 
  1.4</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the direct benefits of GHG mitigation represented in terms of 
  reductions in impacts resulting from climate change, the cost-effectiveness 
  perspective also considers benefits from reductions in other pollutants<a href="fn1.htm#4" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#4","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>4</sup></small></a> 
  that may accompany the GHG emission reductions. Given the focus on climate change 
  mitigation as the primary objective the term used most often is &#147;ancillary 
  benefits&#148; (see also <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a>). The term &#147;co-benefits&#148; 
  is used for situations where climate change and other environmental or socioeconomic 
  objectives are equally important. That notion comes more naturally from the 
  sustainability perspective and reflects that most policies designed to address 
  GHG mitigation also have other, often at least equally important, rationales, 
  e.g. related to development, equity and sustainability.</p>
