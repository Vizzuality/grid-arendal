<h4>10.3.2.1 Decision-making Process Related to Sustainable Development </h4>
<p>Actions that steer the course of society and its economic and governmental 
  organizations are largely tasks of making decisions and solving problems. This 
  requires choosing issues that require attention, setting goals, finding or designing 
  suitable courses of action, and evaluating and choosing among alternative actions. 
  The first three of these activities&#151;fixing agendas, setting goals, and 
  designing actions&#151;are usually called problem solving; the last, evaluating 
  and choosing, is usually called decision making (Simon <i>et al</i>., 1986). Except 
  for trivial cases, decision making generally involves complicated processes 
  of setting actions and dynamic factors that begins with the identification of 
  a stimulus for action and ends with a specific commitment to action (Mintzberg, 
  1994). The complexity of the decision-making process related to sustainable 
  development becomes even more problematic simply because the difference between 
  the present state and a desired state is not clearly perceived, so &#147;we 
  have a better understanding on what is unsustainable rather than what is sustainable&#148; 
  (Fricker, 1998).</p>
<p>Much of the ambiguity arises from the lack of measurements that could provide 
  policymakers with essential information on the alternative choices at stake, 
  on how these choices affect clear and recognizable social, economic, and environmental 
  critical issues. Such measurements could also provide a basis for evaluating 
  policymakers&#146; performance in achieving goals and targets. Management requires 
  measurement and now, as never before, government institutions and the international 
  community are concerned with establishing the means to assess and report on 
  progress towards sustainable development. &#147;If we genuinely embrace sustainable 
  development, we must have some idea if the path we are going on is heading towards 
  it or away from it. There is no way we can know that unless we know what it 
  is we are trying to achieve&#151;i.e. what sustainable development means&#151;and 
  unless we have indicators that tell us whether we are on or off a sustainable 
  development path&#148; (Pearce, 1998). Therefore, indicators are indispensable 
  to make the concept of sustainable development operational. They are particularly 
  useful for decision making because they help (Hardi and Barg, 1997):</p>
<ul>
  <li>understand what sustainable development means in operational terms (in this 
    sense, measurement and indicators are explanatory tools, which translate the 
    concepts of sustainable development into practical terms);<br>
  </li>
  <li>make policy choices to move towards sustainable development (measurement 
    indicators create linkages between everyday activities, and sustainability 
    indicators provide a sense of direction for decision makers when they choose 
    among policy alternatives, that is they are planning tools); and<br>
  </li>
  <li>decide how successful efforts to meet sustainable development goals and 
    objectives have been (in this sense measurement and indicators are performance 
    assessment tools).</li>
</ul>
<p>The past few years have witnessed a rapidly increasing interest in the construction 
  of sustainable development indicators to assess the significance of sustainability 
  concerns in economic analysis and policy. Different analytical frameworks have 
  been suggested to identify, develop, and communicate indicators of sustainability. 
  Hardi and Barg (1997), in an extensive survey of ongoing work on measuring sustainability, 
  discuss the advantages and limitations of different approaches from the viewpoint 
  of their practical applicability. The main differences among frameworks are 
  (1) the ways and means by which they identify measurable dimensions, and select 
  and group the issues to be measured; and (2) the concepts by which they justify 
  the identification and selection procedure. Some of the major frameworks are 
  briefly summarized below.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent is the Human Development Index developed by the United 
  Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to ranks a country&#146;s performance on 
  the criteria of human development, instead of solely the economic performance. 
  Though the index was not developed as a sustainable development index, recent 
  efforts have been made to supplement it with an environmental dimension to encompass 
  explicitly the multiple dimensions of sustainability. Integrated environmental&#150;economic 
  accounting is a framework that is rapidly gaining prominence. The basic idea 
  of this approach is to establish links between the conventional circular production&#150;consumption 
  economic accounting to the natural support system through the extraction of 
  resources in one direction and the discharge of residuals in the other (Tietenberg, 
  1996). Another framework that is attracting a high level of interest is the 
  multiple capital approach. This approach recognizes that a country&#146;s wealth 
  is the combination of economic, environmental, and social capital and these 
  dimensions of capitals should be preserved, enriched, or substituted if consumed. 
  The World Bank&#146;s <i>Measure of the Wealth of Nations</i> (World Bank, 1997) 
  is the most notable application of this framework. The concept of genuine savings 
  is introduced in the World Bank approach to measure the true rate of saving 
  of a nation after accounting for the depreciation of produced assets, the depletion 
  of natural resources, investments in human capital, and the value of global 
  damages from carbon emissions. Lastly, the Pressure&#150;State&#150;Response 
  framework (OECD,1993; UNCSD, 1996) focuses on the causal relationships between 
  stress-generating human activities, changes in the state of the natural and 
  social environment, and society responses to these changes through environmental, 
  general economic, and sectoral policies.</p>
<p>Different sets of thematic indicators are devised for use at different scales. 
  The broadest scale is the international or global level. In this context, global 
  conventions and protocols, such as the climate, biodiversity, desertification, 
  and ozone agreements, are extremely important. It is becoming increasingly clear 
  that unless specifically tailored indicators are developed and monitored, the 
  implementation of these conventions is not possible. Both the secretariats of 
  the conventions and international agencies are working intensely not only to 
  identify and develop appropriate indicators, but also, most importantly, to 
  give them acceptability in the eyes of the international community (Gallopin, 
  1997).</p>
<p>At the national level, several important steps to make operational the concept 
  of sustainable development have being undertaken. Different sets of thematic 
  indicators are being used for each of the major issues in national environmental 
  policy, reflecting differences in national endowment, level of development, 
  and cultural traditions, as well as the heterogeneity within countries. The 
  indicators generally cover every aspect of pollution control, nature conservation, 
  resource depletion, social welfare, health, education, employment, waste management, 
  etc.&#151;in short, a compendium of all the components of traditional development 
  goals and conventional policy debate. Hence, factors that distinguish sustainable 
  development from traditional development tend to be submerged under a sea of 
  age-old problems that are made no more readily soluble by bearing the name sustainable 
  development (George, 1999). The point is that current definitions of indicators 
  and the use of terminology are particularly confusing and some clarity and consensus 
  is required about the definition of what an indicator is, as well as in the 
  definition of related concepts such as threshold, index, target, and standard. 
  This consensus cannot be based solely on political agreement; logical and epistemological 
  soundness is also necessary (Gallopin, 1997).</p>
<p>It is recognized (Hardi and Barg, 1997) that much work remains to be done. 
  Some approaches lack causal linkages or they tend to over simplify interlinkages 
  and relations among issues; others focus on the measurement of those segments 
  of sustainable development that can be expressed in monetary terms; in some 
  cases detailed calculations of indicators are highly technical and difficult 
  to handle. Fresh initiatives oriented to capture complex interlinkages in the 
  interactions between human activity and the environment, especially those related 
  to pressure&#150;state&#150;response causalities, have been undertaken in recent 
  years (Meadows, 1998; Bossel, 1999). Undoubtedly, all these efforts are needed 
  to provide decision makers with information and operational criteria to assess 
  current situations and evaluate strategic decisions. Furthermore, these efforts 
  hold the additional promise of treating environmental problems within a framework 
  that the key institutions and agencies in any government will understand.</p>
