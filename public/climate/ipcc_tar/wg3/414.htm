<h4>10.3.2.3.1 Lifestyles as an Expression of Identity </h4>
<p>As far as an individual&#146;s behaviour can be explained in terms of economic 
  rationality, changes in lifestyles would seem to be a matter of changing relative 
  prices of commodities by economic policy. In general, however, the rationality 
  of human behaviour is beyond economic rationality. Examples from India as well 
  as from the USA are referred to by Douglas <i>et al</i>. (1998), who note that the 
  majority of lifestyles are &#147;not economically rational, but they are still 
  culturally rational&#148;. Therefore &#147;the social and cultural dimensions 
  of human needs and wants must be included in the theoretical approaches.&#148;</p>
<p>In cultural anthropology human behaviour is interpreted in terms of finding 
  one&#146;s place within the social universe by relating oneself to others (not 
  only to the proverbial Joneses next door), that is by setting up distinctions 
  in the community. In doing so commodities are a means of discrimination. They 
  &#147;constitute the visible part of culture as the tip of the iceberg which 
  is the whole of the social processes&#148; (R&oslash;pke, 1999). Of course, 
  many goods satisfy needs as well, but they do even this because of their social 
  capacity to make sense in the individual&#146;s social context. This explanation 
  of human consumption behaviour&#151;as advanced by Douglas and Isherwood (1979)&#151;seems 
  to be considerably more comprehensive than a purely economic one. However, even 
  if in their account &#147;human beings are conceived of as social, ... they 
  are just as unpleasant pursuers of their own interests as they are in economics&#148; 
  (R&oslash;pke, 1999).</p>
<p>Goods, however, make sense not only with respect to others. It has been observed 
  in marketing research that people since the 1960s have gradually passed from 
  buying goods like food, clothing, or housing to basically buying personality, 
  the hardware commodities being part of that (Tomlinson, 1990). In doing so an 
  individual relates to him- or herself rather than to others. Consumers by now 
  are &#147;engaged in an ongoing enterprise of self-creation, ... a &#145;cultural 
  project&#146; ... the purpose of which is to complete the self&#148; by consumption 
  (McCracken, 1988, p. 88). As far as consumption is responsible for climate change, 
  this means that people in developed countries (and their fellow consumers in 
  less-developed countries) aim for self-realization at the expense of others.</p>
<p>The general rule is that human behaviour expresses one&#146;s implicit or explicit 
  self-definition (Meyer-Abich, 1997). Moisander (in press) points out that this 
  project of identity is not limited to the paradigm of the rational, autonomous, 
  and self-certain individual. In the consumer society &#147;The ways in which 
  people relate to their possessions can be seen as reflections of how they view 
  themselves and relate to their social and physical environment&#148; (Dittmar, 
  1992, p. 125). They express who we are, even if they do so not necessarily in 
  a consistent way. The &#147;social life of things&#148; (Appadurai, 1986) animates 
  all kinds of commodities.</p>
<p>All this seems to imply that any attempt to change lifestyles intentionally 
  is bound to fail. Intercultural experience, however, shows that &#147;the Western 
  conception of the person as a bounded, unique, more or less integrated motivational 
  and cognitive universe ... is ... a rather peculiar idea within the context 
  of the world&#146;s cultures&#148; (Geertz, 1979, p. 229). Although in the Western 
  world even the modern state is supposed to have been established by an agreement 
  of independent, or decontextualized individuals, the question &#147;Who am I?&#148; 
  in other cultures is generally answered by reference to the contexts in which 
  one belongs. That is, to dependencies, and not by independence claims with respect 
  to oneself. Western people tend to believe that they are what they are just 
  for themselves, as if everybody had only his or her first name, but even in 
  Europe the idea of individual salvation after death, for instance, did not develop 
  before the 12th century (Ari&egrave;s, 1977). In contrast, intercultural studies 
  have shown that traditional Asian, African, Latin American, and even Southern 
  European concepts of self indicate an interdependent identity (Cousins 1989; 
  Markus and Kitayama, 1991). This means &#147;that behaviour is seen as context-bound 
  and aimed towards a harmonious fit with the expectations and evaluations of 
  others, who are continuously involved in one&#146;s definition of self&#148; 
  (Dittmar, 1992, p. 190). The barrier of consumption-based identity at the expense 
  of others might, therefore, be overcome by contextualizing the Western self 
  in intercultural communication. <a href="415.htm">Section 10.3.2.3.2</a>. gives 
  some indications of how this could be fostered politically.</p>
