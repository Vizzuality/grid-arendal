<h4>6.3.4.3 Standardization of Measurement Procedures </h4>
<p>Several efforts are underway to standardize measurement procedures. For example, 
  in the automotive industry, manufacturers from Europe, Japan, and the USA, jointly 
  with respective governments, are trying to harmonize exhaust emission measurement 
  methods for heavy-duty diesel vehicles (such as actual running conditions, measurement 
  equipment, and procedures) by 2006. If successful, the automobile manufacturers&#146; 
  association intends to ask their respective governments to mandate the outcome.</p>
<p>Other international standards are set by the Organization for International 
  Standardization (ISO). The ISO has begun to establish international Environmental 
  Management standards in its 14000 series. The first standard among them (ISO 
  14001, Environmental Management Standard or EMS) was published in 1996 (ISO, 
  1996).</p>
<p>ISO environmental standards are framework standards and do not set any performance 
  standards. They are flexible to facilitate application by a wide variety of 
  organizations throughout the world. An organization can select any environmental 
  aspects (such as emissions to air and/or water, ozone depletion, climate change, 
  etc.) it considers important for its activities. This means that the standards 
  may be effective as tools to cope with global warming if they are utilized for 
  that purpose. In December 1997, the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI) of the 
  OECD and the ISO issued a Joint Statement concerning the potential contribution 
  of international standards to climate change (ISO, 1998a). In 1998, ISO established 
  a Climate Technology Task Force to review the application of the ISO 14000 series 
  to climate change (ISO, 1998b).</p>
<p>In January 2000, ISO&#146;s Technical Management Board established an Ad Hoc 
  Group on Climate Change (AHGCC) to develop a comprehensive ISO strategy for 
  climate change. While ISO has not ratified a climate change strategy, the AHGCC 
  has identified several areas in which the development and use of ISO standards 
  may help facilitate implementation of the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol, including 
  (among others):</p>
<ul>
  <li>codes of practice and guidelines for accreditation bodies and operational 
    entities;<br>
  </li>
  <li>CDM project validation, verification, and/or certification standards; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>GHG measurement, monitoring, and reporting standards.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="6344"></a>6.3.4.4 International Voluntary Agreements with Industry</h4>
<p>Several voluntary initiatives that have an international impact have been identified. 
  For instance, various multinational firms have undertaken voluntary actions 
  to cope with climate change, including setting up emissions trading systems 
  and engaging in trades.</p>
<p>A VA was concluded in July 1998 between the EC and the European Automobile 
  Manufactures Association (ACEA). The EC subsequently negotiated a similar agreement 
  with Japanese and Korean car manufacturers. The agreements are expected to reduce 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from new cars in 2008 by 25% below the 1995 level. 
  Implementation is contingent on several preconditions, such as fuel quality 
  improvement. The EC has been engaged in discussions with European industry associations 
  regarding a possible VA on energy efficiency in televisions and videocassette 
  recorders (EEA, 1997).</p>
<p>The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Statement by Financial Institutions 
  on the Environment and Sustainable Development and the UNEP Insurance Initiative 
  may be classified as international VAs. Banks and insurance companies that sign 
  these initiatives have to pay attention to environmental protection in their 
  management and in their product selections and operations. These initiatives 
  are not binding and no monitoring of conduct has been carried out. In addition, 
  the territorial distribution of the signing banks and insurance companies is 
  uneven; participation from developing countries and the USA is rare, and no 
  Japanese banks signed the Financial Institutions Initiative.</p>
<p>Some domestic VAs may evolve as de facto international VAs. The Energy Star 
  programme began in 1992 as a voluntary partnership between the US DOE, the US 
  Environmental Protection Agency, product manufacturers, and others. Partners 
  promote energy efficient products by labelling them with the Energy Star logo 
  and educating consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#77","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>77</sup></small></a> 
  A similar programme has started in Japan, and several European governments and 
  manufacturers are considering setting up similar programmes. No analyses of 
  the costs and impacts of these programmes are available.</p>
