<p> <b><a name="1"></a><sup>1</sup></b> The data in this table differ slightly 
  from the data presented in Figures 3.1 and 3.2 because those figures are based 
  on IEA data alone while the data in the table represents a combination of IEA 
  and British Petroleum data (further described in the next paragraph of the text). 
  Also, in Figure 3.1, primary energy was calculated using IEA&#146;s physical 
  energy content method which is based on the primary energy sources used to produce 
  heat and electricity (IEA, 2000) while in Table 3.1, primary energy was calculated 
  using a standard electricity conversion efficiency of 33% (Price <i>et al</i>., 
  1998).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="2"></a><sup>2</sup></b> The IEA 
  explains: &#147;Countries often have several &#145;official&#146; sources of 
  data such as a Ministry, a Central Bureau of Statistics, a nationalized electricity 
  company, etc. Data can also be collected from the energy suppliers, the energy 
  consumers or the customs statistics. The IEA tries to collect the most accurate 
  data, but does not necessarily have access to the complete data set that may 
  be available to national experts calculating emissions inventories for the UNFCCC&#148; 
  (IEA, 1997c).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="3"></a><sup>3</sup></b> The results 
  of this allocation scheme were compared to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 
  (LBNL) sectoral energy data for a number of developed countries. In general, 
  the sectoral energy consumption values based on allocated IEA data compare favourably 
  to LBNL data for total buildings and agriculture for most countries. Larger 
  discrepancies were seen between the LBNL data and the allocated IEA data at 
  the level of commercial and residential buildings.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="4"></a><sup>4</sup></b> Biological carbon sequestration is discussed 
  in Chapter 4.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="5"></a><sup>5</sup></b> Levelized 
  costs include capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, fuel costs, etc.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="6"></a><sup>6</sup></b> Trends 
  in primary energy use and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the EIT region cannot 
  be compared because these values are from two different data sources (see Price 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="7"></a><sup>7</sup></b> HFCs 
  are used as a replacement gas for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are being 
  phased out globally under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
  Ozone Layer.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="8"></a><sup>8</sup></b> For example, 
  traditional fuels based on biomass account for a large share of residential 
  energy consumption in Nicaragua (43%), El Salvador (44%), Honduras (50%), Paraguay 
  (51%), Guatemala (61%) and Haiti (87%) (UNDP, 1999).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="9"></a><sup>9</sup></b> Many countries provide a discussion of these 
  technologies and measures in their National Communications to the UNFCCC (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.unfccc.int/text/resource/natcom/" target="_blank">http://www.unfccc.int/text/resource/natcom/</a>).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="10"></a><sup>10</sup></b> It 
  is noted that production of these efficient products increases energy use for 
  materials production in the industrial sector (Gielen, 1997).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="11"></a><sup>11</sup></b> The 
  review of more recent information bearing on the technical and economic potential 
  of energy efficiency measures gives no reason to change the earlier estimate 
  in the IPCC technical paper (see, for example, Brown <i>et al</i>., 1998; de Almeida 
  and Fonseca, 1999; Jochem, 1999; Kainuma <i>et al</i>., 1999a; Lenstra, 1999; Levine 
  <i>et al</i>, 1996; Schaeffer and Almeida, 1999; Sheinbaum <i>et al</i>., 1998; Urge-Vorsatz 
  and Szesler, 1999; Zhou, 1999).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="12"></a><sup>12</sup></b> The 
  original analysis was based on the IS92a scenario. From the set of IPCC SRES 
  scenarios, for the period covered in this chapter (up to 2020), scenario B2 
  most resembles baseline scenarios with the low levels of technology introduction 
  used in the literature assessed here.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="13"></a><sup>13</sup></b> Of 
  the efficiency measures that are technically and economically feasible, the 
  IPCC report estimated that between 35% and 60% could be adopted in the market 
  through known and established policy approaches.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="14"></a><sup>14</sup></b> NACE 
  codes 15 to 37.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="15"></a><sup>15</sup></b> <i>Chapter 3 Appendix Options to Reduce 
  Global Warming Contributions from Substitutes for Ozone Depleting Substances</i> 
  elaborates on the sectors that would be affected by both the Montreal Protocol 
  and the Kyoto Protocol.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="16"></a><sup>16</sup></b> C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub> 
  emissions typically are 10% of CF<sub>4</sub> emissions.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="17"></a><sup>17</sup></b> The 
  1995 to 2020 potentials for Germany are lower on an annual basis, but this may 
  be due to the long time-frame underestimating the potential.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="18"></a><sup>18</sup></b> Although 
  primarily targetted for electricity generation in less densely populated rural 
  areas (distributed generation), fuel cell manufacturers have always had high 
  aspirations for the transport market.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="19"></a><sup>19</sup></b> For 
  fuel cells all efficiencies cited are based on higher heating values (HHV).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="20"></a><sup>20</sup></b> Because 
  of low operating costs and the fact that many nuclear power plants are already 
  fully depreciated.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="21"></a><sup>21</sup></b> Rising 
  coal and gas market prices such as observed for oil in 2000 would change the 
  competitive position of nuclear substantially.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="22"></a><sup>22</sup></b> The 
  actual high-level waste accumulated over 30 years amounts to approximately 1 
  m<sup>3</sup>/MWe.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="23"></a><sup>23</sup></b> In 
  late 1999 the AP600 received Design Certification from the US Nuclear Regulatory 
  Commission.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="24"></a><sup>24</sup></b> Both 
  designs received Design Certification from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
  in 1997.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="25"></a><sup>25</sup></b> The 
  integrated heat loss from the reactor vessel exceeds the decay heat production 
  in the post accident condition, and the peak temperature reached in the core 
  during the transient is below the demonstrated fuel degradation point and far 
  below the temperature at which the physical structure is affected. The prospect 
  of a &#147;core melt&#148; scenario is therefore zero. <br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="26"></a><sup>26</sup></b> The 
  nuclear mitigation potential is based on the following assumption: between 2000 
  and 2020 nuclear capacities increase to the 520GW<sub>e</sub> of the high IAEA 
  projection and substitute incremental coal capacities with global average efficiencies 
  of 39.4% and 44.1% in 2010 and 2020, respectively (compared to 33.1% and 35.1% 
  in the IEA World Energy Outlook (IEA, 1986)). The nuclear share in global electricity 
  generation would then amount to 13%.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="27"></a><sup>27</sup></b> Practical/technical 
  constraints on the use of land for bioenergy such as the distance of a proposed 
  biomass production site from energy demand centres, the power distribution grid, 
  or sources of labour are not considered here. Hence the estimate exceeds the 
  270EJ of Hall and Rosillo-Calle (1998a).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="28"></a><sup>28</sup></b> For 
  comparison: the total commitment of Annex I countries according to the Kyoto 
  Protocol is estimated to be 500MtC (SRES-scenario B2 as reference).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="29"></a><sup>29</sup></b> Some 
  double-counting in the emission reduction estimates occur, especially between 
  electricity saving options and options in the electricity production sector. 
  However, further analysis shows that the effect of double-counting is just noise 
  within the uncertainty range.
