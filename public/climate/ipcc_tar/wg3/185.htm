<h2>5.3 Sources of Barriers and Opportunities </h2>
<p>Barriers to climate change mitigation are inherent to the process of development. 
  Sustainable development in a participatory framework can minimize these barriers, 
  but the inequitable distribution of income and wealth forms a core feature of 
  barriers to effective implementation of any type of intervention, and those 
  related to climate change are no exception. The poor in any society bear a disproportionate 
  burden of the impact of externalities. Climate change affects them more, because 
  they often lack the infrastructure to withstand its impacts. The poor also pay 
  more as a proportion of their income for energy services, and often tend to 
  use traditional fuels secured outside the formal market system. They are not 
  able to access subsidized fuels for instance, because they do not have the collateral 
  to access these fuels and the equipment to use them. Appropriate ways of financing 
  would be one way to overcome such barriers, provided they explicitly account 
  for the non-existence of markets for some segments of society. The issue of 
  segmentation is valid for firms as well. Small and medium-sized firms for instance 
  face information and market-structure barriers that well-structured large firms 
  can readily overcome with the resources at their disposal. </p>
<p>Lifestyles, behaviour, and consumption patterns all evolve as societies develop 
  within their own socio-cultural contexts. With the advent of global communications 
  these factors are being increasingly influenced by changes that are taking place 
  in societies residing thousands of miles away. The communication channels may 
  be viewed as an opportunity to influence the manner in which tomorrow&#146;s 
  society might develop in countries where modern but resource-consumptive technologies 
  and lifestyles have not taken root. Progress in achieving climate change mitigation 
  will depend on how well the seeds of mitigative technological change can be 
  planted and nurtured. </p>
<p>As a prelude to the more detailed sectoral discussion in <a href="205.htm">Section 
  5.4</a>, this section provides a general overview of the process of technological 
  innovation, and the different sources of barriers to the diffusion of new technology 
  and practices, as well as the policy opportunities that they represent. This 
  section is organized by the following categories: prices, financing, trade and 
  environment, market structure, institutional frameworks, information provision; 
  and social, cultural and behavioural norms and aspirations. Within each of these 
  areas, some of the barriers represent failures or imperfections in markets, 
  policies, or other institutions that lie between the status-quo of the market 
  potential and the possible achievement of the economic potential. Other barriers 
  are aspects of institutions or social and cultural systems that economists may 
  not characterize as market imperfections, but which nonetheless limit diffusion 
  of GHG-efficient technology. These latter barriers separate the economic and 
  socioeconomic potentials. Within each of the subsections below barriers and 
  opportunities in both categories are discussed.</p>
