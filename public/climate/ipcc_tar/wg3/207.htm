<h4>5.4.1.1 Opportunities, Programmes, and Policies to Remove Barriers </h4>
<p>Technological and social changes bring about opportunities to improve the efficiency 
  of buildings and appliances. A change in the production line for the manufacture 
  of an appliance offers an opportunity for introducing new energy saving features 
  in an appliance. Likewise, when buildings are sold, a city government may have 
  the opportunity to intervene and have energy saving features installed prior 
  to the registration of that sale. Targeting opportunities at a point where the 
  stock is likely to turnover physically or contractually can reduce the perceived 
  and actual cost to producers and consumers.<br>
  <br>
  Governments have designed policies, programmes, and measures to tap these and 
  other opportunities, and in the residential and commercial buildings sector 
  they fall into nine general categories: voluntary programmes, building efficiency 
  standards, equipment efficiency standards, state market transformation programmes, 
  financing, government procurement, tax credits, accelerated R&amp;D, and a carbon 
  cap and trade system. The last three items are generic and are not dealt with 
  in this section.</p>
<p>Voluntary programmes, such as Energy Star, which is operated by the United 
  States Department of Energy (DOE) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 
  exist for both residential and commercial buildings, and appliances (Harris 
  and Casey-McCabe, 1996). The Energy Star programme works with manufacturers 
  to promote existing energy-efficient products, such as residential buildings, 
  personal computers, TVs, etc., and to develop new ones. Manufacturers can affix 
  an easily visible label to products that meet Energy Star minimum standards. 
  These programmes also facilitate the exchange of information between end-users 
  on their experience with energy-saving techniques. </p>
<p>Building efficiency standards focus primarily on the building shell and/or 
  the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system, and in commercial 
  buildings also on lighting and water heating. Standards are being implemented 
  in California and other states in the USA, and also in Singapore and Malaysia, 
  and have been proposed or are on the books in Indonesia, the Philippines, and 
  Mexico (Janda and Busch, 1994).</p>
<p>Equipment standards require that all new equipment meet minimum energy efficiency 
  standards. Standards on household appliances and lighting have been in place 
  in the US for over a decade and are expected to be tightened between 2000 and 
  2005 (McMahon and Turiel, 1997). About 30 developed and developing countries 
  and EITs have voluntary or mandatory standards and labels in place on more than 
  40 household appliances (CLASP, 2000).</p>
<p>Demand-side management (DSM) programmes provide rebates, targeted delivery 
  of efficient appliances and lighting to low-income households, information campaigns, 
  and the like. These were pursued vigorously in some states in the USA. The deregulation 
  of the US energy supply sector has reduced the emphasis on these programmes. 
  Nevertheless, in several states that previously had these programmes, public 
  benefit funds for energy efficiency have replaced the DSM programmes, and are 
  typically charged to the electricity consumer on his electricity bill (Kushler 
  and Witte, 2000).</p>
<p>Financing programmes spread the incremental investment costs over time and 
  reduce the first cost impediment to adoption of energy-efficient technologies. 
  For commercial buildings, ESCOs offer energy savings performance contracts that 
  guarantee a fixed amount of savings and are paid through the cost savings. </p>
<p>Government procurement policies have accelerated the adoption of new technologies 
  in the USA and Sweden. In the USA, federal regulations regarding procurement 
  were amended in 1997 to limit purchases to equipment that falls in the top 25% 
  of energy efficiency for similar products (McKane and Harris, 1996). </p>
<p>To effectively enhance dissemination of improved cookstoves, policies, and 
  measures need to be put in place. The introduction of affordable credit financing 
  is widely recognized in Africa as one of the effective measures, which will 
  go a long way in removing the financing barrier. Assistance is still needed 
  in some locations on the design, introduction of centralized small and medium-sized 
  production centres, and marketing of energy efficient stoves, especially where 
  biomass fuels are commercialized &#150; typically as part of small enterprise 
  development. Further research and development work is also essential to increase 
  the efficiency of improved biomass stoves. For example, the British NGO, Energy 
  for Sustainable Development (ESD) is financing and supporting a team of Ethiopian 
  professionals working in household management and supply. It has achieved remarkable 
  success in developing and commercializing two types of improved biomass cookstoves 
  through an iterative approach of needs assessment, product design, redesign, 
  and performance monitoring (Farinelli, 1999). The team consists of consumers, 
  stove producers and stove installers, and pays attention to promotion, technical 
  assistance, and quality production. </p>
