<h4>3.8.4.2.4 New Reactor Technologies</h4>
<p>The future of nuclear power will depend on whether it can meet several objectives 
  simultaneously &#150; economics, operating safety, proliferation safeguards, 
  and effective solutions to waste disposal. While present new nuclear power plants 
  already incorporate unprecedented levels of safety based on in-depth designs, 
  their economics need further improvement to be competitive in most markets. 
  Safe waste disposal for approximately 1 million years is technically feasible 
  (Whipple, 1996) and would add US$0.0002/kWh to generating costs (Kadak, 1999; 
  Goldemberg, 2000). Disposal cost estimates for Sweden are higher, i.e., US$0.0013. 
  Proliferation is a political issue primarily, but can also be addressed by technology. 
  Evolutionary technology improvements of existing designs are important elements 
  for the near-term viability of nuclear power but may not be sufficient to me<i><i>et 
  al</i></i>l the objectives optimally. For example, smaller grid sizes in developing 
  countries demand smaller unit size reactors. Therefore, new technology that 
  addresses these objectives by integral design holds the key to the future of 
  nuclear power. </p>
<p>Building on more than 40 years of experience with LWR technology, major nuclear 
  reactor vendors have now developed modified LWRs that offer both improved safety 
  and lower cost (CISAC, 1995; Kupitz and Cleveland, 1999). These evolutionary 
  development efforts resulted in standardized designs for which there can be 
  a high degree of confidence that performance and cost targets will be met. All 
  employ active but simplified safety systems, and some have some passive safety 
  features. </p>
<p>One reactor in this category is the Westinghouse AP600, a 600 MWe pressurized 
  water reactor (PWR). The design is simpler than existing PWRs and modular, with 
  about half the capacity of most existing PWRs&#151;which allows some components 
  to be factory built and assembled faster onsite at lower cost than for plants 
  that are entirely field constructed. The AP600 is expected to be safer than 
  existing PWRs, constructed in three years, and costs about 15% less than existing 
  PWRs of the same capacity (NPDP, 1998)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#23","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>23</sup></small></a>. 
</p>
<p>Other examples include the ABB/Combustion Engineering System 80+ and the GE 
  Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#24","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>24</sup></small></a>. 
  The System 80+ is a large (1,350 MWe) unit for which the estimated core damage 
  frequency is two orders of magnitude lower than for its predecessor. The ABWR 
  has as a design objective stepped-up operating safety and a target capital cost 
  that is 20% less than for BWRs previously built in Japan (NPDP, 1998). Two ABWRs 
  are now operating in Japan. Two more are under construction in Japan and also 
  in Taiwan/China. </p>
<p>In Europe, a Framatome/Siemens joint venture has developed the European pressurized 
  water reactor (EPR), a 1,450 to 1,750 MWe system designed to specifications 
  endorsed by utilities in Europe&#151;with hoped-for economies of scale at this 
  large unit size. The EPR is being offered on the international market.</p>
<p>One of the innovative designs is the pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR) developed 
  by the South African utility ESKOM. The fundamental concept of the design is 
  to achieve a plant that has no physical process, however unlikely, that could 
  cause a radiation-induced hazard outside the site boundary. This is principally 
  achieved in the PBMR<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#25","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>25</sup></small></a>. 
</p>
<p>The current ESKOM assessment is that the capital cost of a production of 1000MWe 
  block of 10 modules will be US$1,000/kWe (US$1,200/kWe for the prototype). The 
  low capital costs are the result of a much lower energy density of the reactor 
  core than present reactor technologies; the elimination of heat exchangers; 
  use of a direct helium turbine; the shift of the containment from the plant 
  periphery to the pebble fuel; a high in-shop manufacturing component of the 
  plant, and a short construction period of 2 years. This would produce attractive 
  generating costs with unprecedented safety aspects. As a base load station with 
  a depreciation period of 20 years and at a 10% discount rate, the expected cost 
  of power would be approximately US$0.018/kWh including the full fuel cycle and 
  decommissioning. These costs are low indeed and in part the result of engineering 
  optimism. Other studies based on the less advanced modular high temperature 
  reactor (HTR) designs conclude that generating costs may range from US$0.020 
  to US$0.034/kWh (Lako, 1996). Kadak (1999) estimates the unit capital cost for 
  a PBMR plant with some different design characteristics at twice the ESKOM value, 
  i.e., US$2,090/kWe which results in generating costs of US$0.033/kWh but still 
  less than average present technology.</p>
<h4><a name="38425"></a>3.8.4.2.5 GHG Mitigation Potential</h4>
<p>Increased performance and lifetime extension of the currently existing nuclear 
  reactors often present a zero-costs greenhouse gas mitigation option. However, 
  given current market conditions, new nuclear power capacity is a least-cost 
  alternative in only some countries usually characterized by limited indigenous 
  fossil resources or by large distances between resource location and consumption 
  centres. Under such circumstances nuclear power is a zero cost mitigation option. 
  If the optimistic PBMR generating costs can be accomplished, this would certainly 
  imply negative mitigation costs. For new nuclear plants of state-of-the art 
  designs, a value of US$0 to 40/tC avoided would put nuclear at par with coal-fired 
  electricity, while it would take a value of a US$100 to 250/tC for nuclear power 
  to break even with natural gas combined cycle electricity (IEA, 1998a; Rogner, 
  2000b). Based on the current global electricity mix, nuclear power avoids some 
  600MtC of carbon per year (Rogner, 1999). </p>
<p>The most recent projection of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
  is that in the absence of any policies with regard to climate change, capacity 
  in 2020 could be in the range 300GWe to 520GWe (from 349GWe in 1999). This means 
  that the share of nuclear power in total power generation could decline to 6% 
  - 8% by 2020 (IAEA, 2000a). Compared to the reference case of the IEA World 
  Energy Outlook (IEA, 1998b), the higher projection of IAEA would avoid the emission 
  of 87MtC in 2010 and 281MtC in 2020 over and above the reference case assuming 
  that nuclear power displaces coal-fired electricity26. Maintaining the past 
  nuclear share in global electricity generation would avoid annually 280MtC in 
  2010 and 550MtC in 2020 (again above the IEA reference case of approximately 
  600GtC)<br>
