<h4>6.2.2.2 Emissions Taxes and Charges </h4>
<p>An emission tax on GHG emissions requires domestic emitters to pay a fixed 
  fee, or tax, for every tonne of CO<sub>2eq</sub> of GHG released into the atmosphere. 
  Such a fee would encourage reductions in GHG emissions in response to the increased 
  price associated with those emissions. In particular, measures to reduce emissions 
  that are less expensive than paying the tax would be undertaken.</p>
<p>Since every emitter faces a uniform tax on emissions per tonne of CO<sub>2eq</sub> 
  (if energy, equipment, and product markets are perfectly competitive) this would 
  result in the least expensive reductions throughout the economy being undertaken 
  first (IPCC, 1996, Section 11.5.1; Baumol and Oates, 1988). In the real world, 
  markets, especially energy markets, deviate from this ideal, so an emissions 
  tax may not maximize economic efficiency. Rather, the efficiency of an emissions 
  tax should be compared with that of alternative policy measures. Criteria other 
  than efficiency, such as distributional impacts, are likely to influence the 
  design of the emissions tax where this is the chosen policy. Although equity 
  considerations could be, in theory, better addressed through other redistribution 
  mechanisms, in practice most energy and emissions taxes apply differential tax 
  rates to different sources.</p>
<p>An emissions tax, unlike emissions trading, does not guarantee a particular 
  level of emissions. Therefore, it may be necessary to adjust the tax level to 
  meet an internationally agreed emissions commitment (depending on the structure 
  of the international agreement; see <a href="246.htm">Section 6.3</a>). The 
  main economic advantage of an emissions tax is that it limits the cost of the 
  reduction programme by allowing emissions to rise if costs are unexpectedly 
  high (IPCC, 1996, Section 11.2.3.1; see also <a href="251.htm#6342">Section 
  6.3.4.2</a>).</p>
<p>An emissions tax needs to be adjusted for changes in external circumstances, 
  like inflation, technological progress, and increases in emissions (Tietenberg, 
  2000). Inflation increases abatement costs, so to achieve a target emission 
  reduction the tax rate needs to be adjusted for inflation. Fixed emissions charges 
  in the transition economies of Eastern Europe, for example, have been significantly 
  eroded by the high inflation (Bluffstone and Larson, 1997). Technological change 
  generally has the opposite effect, reducing the cost of making emissions reductions. 
  Thus, technological change generally increases the emissions reductions achieved 
  by a fixed (real) tax rate. New sources increase emissions. If the tax is intended 
  to achieve a given emissions limit, the tax rate will need to be increased to 
  offset the impact of new sources (Tietenberg, 2000).</p>
<p>Implementation of a domestic emissions tax touches on many issues (Baron, 1996). 
  Policymakers must consider the collection point, the tax base, the variation 
  or uniformity among sectors, the association with trade, employment, revenue, 
  or R&amp;D policies, and the exact form of the mechanism (e.g., an emissions 
  tax alone or in conjunction with other policy measures). Each of these can influence 
  the appropriate design of a domestic emissions tax.</p>
