<h3>6.1.4 Criteria for Policy Choice </h3>
<p>Governments implement policies and measures to achieve particular objectives 
  that they believe will not be achieved in the absence of government intervention, 
  possibly because externalities or public goods are involved. Policies and measures 
  can be generic, such as a general carbon tax or emissions trading, or sector-specific, 
  such as a regulation applied to the construction sector, or a subsidy for green 
  farming practices. The objective of this chapter is to assess different types 
  of policies and measures, not to provide a complete list of these, so sector-specific 
  policies and measures are discussed only in general terms.</p>
<p><a href="179.htm">Chapter 5</a> draws a distinction among five types of 
  policy targets, each of which refers to a different interpretation (definition) 
  of the concept of &#147;barriers&#148; to technological change: market potential, 
  economic potential, socioeconomic potential, technological potential, and physical 
  potential. Policies and measures can differ in the type of potential they aim 
  to reach, but it is difficult to link specific policy instruments and specific 
  potentials, because the potential achieved through virtually any policy instrument 
  depends upon the &#147;degree&#148; to which that instrument is employed. For 
  example, an emissions tax can be set at various levels; depending upon the level 
  at which the emissions tax is set, it could have the effect (if perfectly implemented) 
  of achieving any of the types of &#147;potential&#148; defined in <a href="179.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>10</sup></small></a> 
  For this, among other reasons, the prime focus in this section is on the possible 
  criteria for policy instrument choice and evaluation.</p>
<p>Evaluation criteria are required both for the ex-ante choice of instruments 
  and for the ex-post assessment of implementation and performance. Each government 
  may apply different weights to the criteria when it evaluates GHG mitigation 
  policy options.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#11","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>11</sup></small></a> 
  Moreover, a government may apply different weights to the criteria when it evaluates 
  national and international policy instruments, and the appropriateness of the 
  criteria may vary depending on the degree of uncertainty about the pollution 
  abatement cost and pollution damage functions. This general remark should be 
  kept in mind when the various domestic and international policies, instruments, 
  and measures discussed in this chapter are evaluated against the background 
  of these criteria.</p>
<p>The criteria identified in SAR for the evaluation of policy options (Fischer 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998) are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Environmental effectiveness. How well does the policy achieve the environmental 
    goal, such as a GHG emissions reduction target? How reliable is the instrument 
    in achieving that target, does the instrument&#146;s effectiveness erode over 
    time, and does the instrument create continual incentives to improve products 
    or processes in ways that reduce emissions?<br>
  </li>
  <li>Cost-effectiveness. Whether the policy achieves the environmental goal at 
    the lowest cost, taking transaction, information, and enforcement costs into 
    account.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Distributional considerations. How the costs of achieving the environmental 
    goal are distributed across groups within society, including future generations.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Administrative and political feasibility. This includes considerations such 
    as flexibility in the face of new knowledge, understandability to the general 
    public, impacts on the competitiveness of different industries, and other 
    government objectives (such as meeting fiscal targets and reducing emissions 
    of pollutants).</li>
</ul>
<p>The literature (e.g., OECD, 1997d) identifies some additional criteria, such 
  as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Revenues raised in the case of market mechanisms, for instance, may constitute 
    a second source of benefits from their use, over and above their direct environmental 
    impact, depending on if and how the revenues are recycled.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Wider economic effects include potential effects on variables such as inflation, 
    competitiveness, employment, trade, and growth.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Wider environmental effects, such as local air-quality improvement (usually 
    referred to as the ancillary benefits).<br>
  </li>
  <li>&#147;Soft&#148; effects, which relate to the impact of environmental policy 
    instruments on changes in attitudes and awareness.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Dynamic effects, which relate to the impact on learning, innovation, technical 
    progress, and dissemination and transfer of technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above lists of criteria guide the discussion of national and international 
  policies and measures related to GHG abatement. However, the economics literature&#150;particular 
  theory development&#150;focuses more on the cost-effectiveness criterion than 
  on the other criteria mentioned, and there is a similar emphasis in this chapter, 
  which is a review of the best available scientific literature. Wherever possible, 
  literature on the potential equity impact of policies and measures is referred 
  to. In addition, specific attention is paid to the political economy literature 
  that describes policy choice (<a href="229.htm">Section 6.1.5</a>), the interactions 
  of policy instruments with fiscal systems (<a href="260.htm#652">Section 6.5.2</a>), 
  and the impacts on technological change (<a href="261.htm">Section 6.5.3</a>).</p>
