<h4>8.2.1.1 National and Regional Cost Studies Assuming Large Potentials for Efficiency 
  Gains (the Impact of No Regrets or Non-price Policies) </h4>
<p>An important part of climate policy debates is underpinned by a lasting controversy 
  between believers and non-believers in the existence of a large untapped efficiency 
  potential in the economy. If there, this potential could be realized at such 
  a small societal cost that it would be more than compensated by cost savings 
  that accrue from the efficiency improvements. Options that have a negative net 
  social cost add up to an overall negative cost potential that may be quite large. 
  <a href="#fig8-1">Figure 8.1</a> is a sketch of the successive marginal costs 
  of abatement, as a function of GHG reduction relative to some baseline point 
  A. The total cost is simply the area between the curve and the horizontal axis. 
  From A to B, marginal abatement costs are negative, and from B onwards, they 
  are positive. The debate revolves around the size of the total (negative) cost 
  from A to B. The studies discussed in this subsection argue that the negative 
  cost area is potentially quite significant, and compensates to a large extent 
  for the positive costs incurred after point B. Most other B-U studies analyzed 
  in the next subsection do not even attempt to evaluate the relative positions 
  of points A and B, since they optimize the system even in the absence of carbon 
  constraint, and thus compute only the points beyond point B.<a name="fig8-1"></a></p>

<p>Krause (1995, 1996) identifies two main reasons why the negative cost area 
  may be quite large: untapped potential for efficiency gains mainly in end-use 
  technologies, both on the demand and on supply sides. Several major studies 
  concretize this view in Europe as well as in North America (USA and Canada). 
  For Europe, the monumental IPSEP reports (summarized in Krause <i>et al.</i> 
  (1999)) conclude that emissions could be reduced by up to 50% below the 1990 
  level by 2030, at a negative overall cost. This involves the judicious implementation 
  of technologies and practices in all sectors of the economy, and the application 
  of a large number of government policies (incentives, efficiency standards, 
  and educational). In the US, some of the 5-Lab studies (Brown <i>et al.,</i> 
  1997a, 2000, particularly the HE/LC scenario) indicate that the Kyoto reduction 
  target could be reached at negative overall cost ranging from &#150;US$7 billion 
  to &#150;US$34 billion. Another study based on the NEMS model (Koomey <i>et 
  al., </i>1998) indicates that 60% of the Kyoto gap could be bridged with an 
  overall increase in the US GDP. The latter study contrasts with another NEMS 
  study (Energy Information Administration, 1998) that indicates GDP losses from 
  1.7% to 4.2% (depending on the extent of permit trading and sink options) for 
  the USA to reach the Kyoto targets. Laitner (1997, 1999) further stresses the 
  impact of efficient technologies on the aggregate cost of mitigation in the 
  USA. In Canada, the MARKAL model was used with and without certain efficiency 
  measures in various sectors (Loulou and Kanudia, 1998; Loulou <i>et al., </i>2000): 
  the results show costs of Kyoto equal to US$20 billion without the additional 
  efficiency measures, versus &#150;US$26 billion when efficiency measures are 
  included in the database. Again in Canada, the ISTUM model was used (Jaccard 
  <i>et al., </i>1996, Bailie <i>et al.,</i> 1998) considering a set of pro-active 
  options. For example, in the residential sector large emissions reductions of 
  17% to 25% relative to 1990 could be achieved as early as 2008 with many negative 
  costs options, and beyond that level of reduction, the marginal costs is ranging 
  from US$25 to US$89/tC.</p>
<p>As extensively discussed in SAR, many economists argue that the real magnitude 
  of negative cost options is not so large if account is taken of:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transaction costs of removing market imperfections that inhibit the adoption 
    of the best technologies and practices;<br>
  </li>
  <li>Hidden costs, such as the risks of using a new technology (maintenance costs, 
    quality of services);<br>
  </li>
  <li>&#147;Rebound effect&#147; because, for example, an improvement in motor 
    efficiency lowers the cost per kilometre driven and has the perverse effect 
    of encouraging more trips; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>Real preferences of consumers: options such as driving habits and modal 
    switches towards rail and mass transit are considered to entail negative costs. 
    This does not consider enough the reality of consumers&#146; behaviour preferences 
    for flexibility and non-promiscuity in transportation modes, or even &#147;symbolic&#148; 
    consumption (such as the preference for high-power cars even in countries 
    with speed limits).</li>
</ul>
<p>These arguments should not be used to refute the very existence of negative 
  cost potentials. They indicate that the applicability of non-price policy measures 
  apt to overcome barriers to the exploitation of these potentials must be given 
  serious attention. Some empirical observations do confirm that active sectoral 
  policies can result in significant efficiency gains, in demand-side management 
  for electricity end-uses for example. However, the many sources of gaps between 
  technical costs and economic costs cannot be ignored (see the taxonomy of Jaffe 
  and Stavins, 1994). The few existing observations (Ostertag, 1999) suggest that 
  the transaction costs may represent, in many cases, a large fraction of the 
  costs of new technology, and there is always an uncertainty about the efficiency 
  and the political acceptability of the policies suggested in the above studies. 
  This issue is clearly exemplified by the set of studies carried out in the USA 
  and collected under the name &#147;5-LAB studies&#148;. In these, some scenarios 
  produce positive incremental costs and others negative costs, depending on the 
  aggressiveness with which efficiency measures are implemented (Interlaboratory 
  Working Group, 1997; Brown <i>et al.,</i> 1998).</p>
<h4><a name="8212"></a>8.2.1.2 Bottom-up Costs Resulting from Carbon Pricing (Developed 
  Countries)</h4>
<p>Contrary to the studies discussed above, the partial equilibrium studies reviewed 
  in this section do not report negative costs. This is because the least-cost 
  algorithms employed, which are powerful to compute the incremental cost of the 
  system with and without a carbon constraint (<i>i.e</i>., point B in <a href="#fig8-1">Figure 
  8.1</a>), demand a set of somewhat arbitrary parameters to be calibrated in 
  such a way that they calculate a suboptimal baseline; but such an operation 
  demands resorting to a set of somewhat arbitary parameters and the results are 
  less easy to interpret. This is why the B-U studies reported hereafter explore 
  only the section of the cost curve with positive carbon prices (section CD in 
  <a href="#fig8-1">Figure 8.1</a>).</p>
<p>It is very hard to encapsulate in a short presentation the many studies carried 
  out with a B-U approach using a crosscutting, carbon-pricing instrument. <a href="#fig8-1">Figure 
  8.1</a> summarizes a number of these results, obtained with a variety of B-U 
  models applied to a single Annex I country or region, ignoring the trade effects. 
  Included are those studies that contain enough information to present the marginal 
  abatement cost along with the level of GHG emission variation from 1990 (other 
  studies that reported only the total abatement cost are discussed separately). 
  In <a href="324.htm#fig8-2">Figure 8.2</a>, each point represents one particular 
  reduction level (relative to 1990) and the corresponding marginal cost of reduction. 
  Points that are linked together by a line correspond to a multi-run study effected 
  with the same model, but in which the amount of reduction was varied. </p>
<div align="right"> </div>
<p>Evidently, <a href="324.htm#fig8-2">Figure 8.2</a> shows considerably discrepancies 
  from study to study. These large variations are explained by a number of factors, 
  some of which reflect the widely differing conditions that prevail in the countries 
  studied, while others result from the modelling and scenario assumptions. These 
  variations are discussed next, illustrated by examples from <a href="324.htm#fig8-2">Figure 
  8.2.</a></p>
<h4><a name="82121"></a>8.2.1.2.1 Cost Discrepancies that Result from Specific 
  Country Conditions</h4>
<ul>
  <li><i>Energy endowment.</i> Countries that are richly endowed with fossil fuels 
    find it generally less expensive to replace coal with gas, and thus have a 
    greater potential than other countries to reduce emissions with readily available 
    means. (This assumes that the change is not done very rapidly, so as to affect 
    as little as possible the turnover rate of the existing investments.) For 
    instance, this is the case for the USA (coal and oil products)<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>2</sup></small></a>.
 
    At the other extreme of the spectrum some countries have fuelled their economy 
    almost exclusively on hydropower, nuclear power, and some gas, and will thus 
    find fewer opportunities to switch to less CO<sub>2</sub>-intensive fuels. 
    This occurs for Norway (hydro), France (nuclear and hydro), Japan (nuclear 
    and some fossil fuels), Switzerland (hydro and nuclear), and to some extent 
    Canada (hydro and nuclear).<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Economic growth.</i> An economy with high growth rate faces the following 
    dilemma. On the one hand, the growth allows for a rapid capital turnover, 
    and thus many opportunities to install efficient or low-carbon technologies. 
    On the other hand, the same economy requires more energy precisely because 
    of its fast growth. The net result is that such countries have a tendency 
    to decrease markedly their energy intensity (energy per GDP), but to increase 
    significantly their total emissions. For such countries, a net reduction of 
    GHG emissions below a base year&#146;s emissions is usually costly. Typically, 
    many fast-developing countries in East and South East Asia are in this category. 
    In the studies cited above, their emissions &#147;reductions&#148; are often 
    computed relative to the baseline rather than to a fixed base year.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Energy intensity. </i>The degree of energy intensity of an economy acts 
    in opposing directions when the economy wishes to achieve net emissions reductions: 
    on the one hand, a high degree of energy intensity may occur because that 
    the country has not yet implemented some efficiency measures implemented elsewhere. 
    On the other hand, such an economy may have been built on energy, and may 
    thus find it hard to veer to a different, less energy-intensive mode, in a 
    short time. Its development path is somewhat frozen, at least in the short 
    term. The higher the carbon intensity, the more important the time frame of 
    abatement. Such a pattern is observable in North America; despite its rapid 
    capital turnover in the industry, the large inertia in sectors such as transportation 
    is a determining factor of high abatement cost when the required abatement 
    implies short term actions on these sectors.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Other specific conditions.</i> For example, Germany faces a very special 
    situation because of the reunification in 1990 to 1991. The East German part 
    of the country emits much less now than in 1990, and the country as a whole 
    is able to effect significant reductions at essentially zero or very low cost, 
    up to a certain point, beyond which its marginal cost may well accelerate 
    considerably.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="82122"></a>8.2.1.2.2 Discrepancies in Results Due to Modelling and 
  Scenario Assumptions</h4>
<ul>
  <li><i>Policy assumptions. </i>The results summarized in <a href="324.htm#fig8-2">Figure 
    8.2</a> are based mostly on partial equilibrium models, which tend to approach 
    general equilibrium computations, such as AIM, NEMS, MARKAL, MARKAL-MACRO, 
    PRIMES, CIMS, etc. Some of these models allow evaluation of the impact on 
    mitigation cost of the redistribution of the proceeds of a carbon tax (the 
    results obtained with the AIM model for Japan (Kainuma <i>et al.,</i> 1999, 
    2000) show very clearly that suitable redistribution reduces the marginal 
    cost of abatement).<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Modelling differences.</i> Some models include partial economic feedbacks 
    in the form of demand elasticities, as for example MARKAL (Loulou and Kanudia, 
    1999a), and for these models the abatement marginal costs are generally lower 
    than when demands are fixed, because it becomes unnecessary to tap the most 
    costly technological options. MARKAL-MACRO and NEMS include macroeconomic 
    components in the computation of the equilibrium, and therefore qualify as 
    general equilibrium models, albeit simplified ones. In addition, these two 
    models include behavioural considerations in the calculation of the equilibrium, 
    which tend to raise the cost of abatement, compared to least-cost models such 
    as MARKAL.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Scenario variation.</i> The variety of scenarios used is quite large, 
    as a result of varying some or all of the relevant elements. These include 
    whether the technologies are allowed to penetrate freely or in a limited fashion 
    (typically renewables, nuclear, and some new end-use technologies), the basket 
    of GHG gases considered (CO<sub>2</sub> alone versus multigas studies), assumed 
    economic growth, and sectoral scope (energy only <i>versus</i> whole economy).<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Example.</i> To illustrate the above comments, <a href="324.htm#fig8-2">Figure 
    8.2</a> indicates that at a marginal cost of less than US$100/tCO<sub>2eq</sub>, 
    the US emissions would still be larger in 2010 than in 1990, according to 
    the NEMS (Energy Information Administration, 1998) and MARKAL (Interagency 
    Analytical Team, 1997) studies. Note that NEMS predicts higher marginal costs 
    than MARKAL for the same emission level, as expected, since NEMS includes 
    many behavioural considerations, whereas MARKAL is a least-cost model. Japan&#146;s 
    emissions would be reduced by 1% to 8% (AIM studies (Kainuma<i> et al.,</i> 
    1999, 2000); Ireland&#146;s (Conniffe <i>et al.,</i> 1997) and Italy&#146;s 
    (Contaldi and Tosato, 1999) emissions would also increase, whereas Canada&#146;s 
    emissions would decrease by 6% (MARKAL study (Loulou<i> et al.,</i> 1998)). 
    The several European studies show a wide range of reductions, from relatively 
    small reductions (PRIMES study (Capros <i>et al., </i>1999a)) to medium or 
    large reductions with the various MARKAL studies (Gielen and Pieters, 1999; 
    Gielen <i>et al.,</i> 1999a; Ybema <i>et al.,</i> 1999). These large variations 
    are mainly explained by the modelling and scenario assumptions: PRIMES marginal 
    costs are expected to be larger than MARKAL&#146;s (just as NEMS costs were 
    larger than MARKAL&#146;s in the US case). In addition, scenario assumptions 
    vary across studies: the number of gases modelled, degree of efficiency of 
    the instrument used across the EU countries, and availability of international 
    permits trading.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several studies are not represented in <a href="324.htm#fig8-2">Figure 8.2</a>, 
  since only incremental or average costs were reported. For instance, a German 
  study (Jochem, 1998) indicates reductions of 30% to 40% in 2010 at average costs 
  ranging from US$12 to US$ 68/tCO<sub>2eq</sub>. In Canada (Loulou and Lavigne, 
  1996), a measure of the impact of demand reduction is obtained by running MARKAL 
  with and without elastic demands for energy services: the total cost is US$52 
  billion with fixed demands, andUS$42 billion with elastic demands. Chung <i>et 
  al.</i> (1997) arrive at much higher total costs for Canada, using a North American 
  equilibrium level (the higher cost apparently results from fewer technological 
  options than in MARKAL) A Swedish MARKAL study (Nystrom and Wene, 1999) find 
  total cost of 210 billion Swedish krona for a stabilization scenario, against 
  640 billion Swedish krona for a 50% emissions reduction in 2010. This same study 
  investigates the opportunity cost of a nuclear phase out, and evaluates a rebound 
  effect on the demands of a 9% emissions reduction for Sweden.<br>
