<h4>10.3.3.2 Technology Transfer: International Aspects </h4>
<h4><a name="103321"></a>10.3.3.2.1 International Technology Transfer Policy</h4>
<p>The legal, economic, and political issues that surround technology transfer 
  have invariably found their place in every international agreement that has 
  anything to do with social, economic, and environmental topics. The Montreal 
  Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer includes several provisions 
  for technology transfer. The Multilateral Fund under the Protocol is a key factor 
  that has facilitated technology transfer to developing countries to comply with 
  the Protocol commitments. Several of the Rio Declaration principles address 
  requirements for states to exchange scientific and technological knowledge and 
  to promote a supportive and open international economic system for the development, 
  adaptation diffusion, and transfer of ESTs. Chapter 34 of Agenda 21, devoted 
  to technology transfer, supports these principles with more detailed proposals 
  for action. The extent to which these proposals have been implemented varies, 
  and debate continues within the UN Commission on Sustainable Development. The 
  Convention on Biological Diversity specifically addresses access to and transfer 
  of technology relevant to the conservation and the sustainable use of biological 
  diversity, including biotechnology.</p>
<p>The UNFCCC requires the parties to the Convention &#147;to promote and cooperate 
  in the development, application, diffusion, including transfer, of technologies, 
  practices and processes that control, reduce or prevent anthropogenic emissions 
  of greenhouse gases&#148; (Article 4.1.c). The Convention calls developed country 
  parties to take all practical steps to promote, facilitate, and finance, as 
  appropriate, the transfer of, as well as access to, ESTs to other parties, particularly 
  to developing country parties. The importance of technology transfer is also 
  recognized in the Kyoto Protocol of the UNFCC. As further discussed in <a href="423.htm">Section 
  10.3.3.2.2</a>, flexible mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol provide strong 
  incentives for technology transfer.</p>
<p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) has proved an effective channel of international 
  technology transfer. Levels of FDI, commercial lending and equity investment 
  all increased dramatically during the 1990s, to the point where official development 
  assistance (ODA) became less than one quarter of the total foreign finance available 
  to developing countries by mid-decade (IPCC, 2000a). The growing role of FDI 
  in technology transfer is supported by various domestic and international developments, 
  including the liberalization of markets, development of stronger domestic legal 
  and financial systems, and tariff reductions under the Uruguay Round of the 
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In this context, issues related 
  to intellectual property rights, in particular the Agreement on Trade Related 
  Aspects of Intellectual Property, will play a prominent role in shaping both 
  the flows and intensity of technology transfer in the future. To function effectively, 
  trade and investment require proper enabling frameworks. These include a stable 
  economic system, transparent and equitable legal and/or financial structures, 
  sound environmental laws, uniform non-discriminatory enforcement procedures, 
  respect for local culture, safe and secure environment for workers and/or contractors, 
  and removal of unnecessary barriers to the movement of personnel and materials.</p>
<p>Beyond the issues concerning property rights and the process of opening national 
  economies, changes in the features of new technologies (systematic character, 
  the important role of users, increasing knowledge intensity) have significant 
  implications for technology transfer policy<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#19","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>19</sup></small></a>.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#19","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small></small></a> 
  In particular, many ESTs are still in the early stages of their development 
  and have a comparatively short track record, so private actors may be unwilling 
  to accept the extra risks or costs involved in utilizing new technologies. In 
  general, the spread of proven ESTs that should diffuse through commercial transactions 
  may be limited because of existing barriers. Barriers to the transfer of ESTs 
  arise at each stage of the process, as discussed in detail in <a href="179.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>. These vary according to the specific context, for example from sector 
  to sector, and can manifest themselves differently in developed countries, developing 
  countries, and countries with economies in transition. Some of the key barriers 
  are summarized in <a href="#box102">Box 10.2</a>. For the success of technology 
  transfer, the parties concerned need to make common efforts to overcome the 
  barriers and create opportunities for the transfer and/or diffusion of technology 
  (Verhoosel, 1997). At present there is no easy answer for overcoming barriers. 
  Measures to be taken depend on the specific barriers and the interests of different 
  stakeholders and are discussed in <a href="179.htm">Chapters 5</a> and <a href="224.htm">6</a>.</p>

          cost.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Poor macroeconomic conditions, which include underdeveloped financial 
          sector, trade barriers (high tariffs and/or quantity controls), high

        <li>Lack of data, information, knowledge, and awareness regarding the 
          availability, characteristics, costs, and benefits of ESTs, especially 
          in the case of &#147;emerging&#148; technologies.<br>

        <li>Lack of markets for ESTs because of lack of confidence in economic

          and enforcing contracts.<br>

        <li>Lack of vision about and understanding of local needs and demands.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Low private sector involvement because of lack of access to capital, 
          in particular inadequate financial strength of smaller firms to manufacture, 
          purchase, and install new ESTs.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Insufficient human and institutional capabilities.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Lack of supporting legal institutions and frameworks, including codes 
          and standards for the evaluation and implementation of ESTs.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Low, often subsidized, conventional energy prices that result in disincentives 
          to adopt energy-saving measures and renewable energy technology.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>To improve the enabling environment for technology transfer and diffusion, 
  governments could consider a number of actions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enact measures, including regulations, taxes, codes, standards, and removal 
    of subsidies, to internalize the full environmental and social costs and reduce 
    unfair commercial risks.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Reform legal systems. Uncertain, slow, and expensive enforcement of contracts 
    by national courts or international arbitration, and insecure property rights 
    can discourage investment.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Reform administrative law to reduce regulatory risk and ensure that public 
    regulation is acceptable to stakeholders and subject to independent review.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Protect intellectual property rights and licenses, and ensure the active 
    use of patents.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Encourage financial reforms, competitive national capital markets, and international 
    capita flows that support FDI. Governments can expand financial lending for 
    ESTs through regulation that allows the design of specialized credit instruments, 
    capital pools, and energy service companies.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Simplify and make transparent program and project approval procedures and 
    public procurement requirements.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Promote competitive markets, liberalize trade policies, and make investment 
    policies transparent.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Encourage national markets for ESTs to facilitate economies of scale and 
    other cost-reducing practices.</li>
</ul>
