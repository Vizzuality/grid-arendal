<h2><a name="47"></a>4.7 Biological Uptake in Oceans and Freshwater Reservoirs, 
  and Geo-engineering </h2>
<p>The net primary production of marine ecosystems is roughly the same as for 
  terrestrial ecosystems (50GtC/yr for marine ecosystems and 60GtC/yr for terrestrial 
  ecosystems), and there are opportunities to increase the net carbon flow into 
  the marine biosphere. There are fundamental differences between the two systems, 
  however, as the marine biosphere does not include large stores of carbon in 
  the living and dead biomass. There are some 3 GtC in marine biota versus nearly 
  2500GtC in terrestrial vegetation and soils (<a href="157.htm#tab41">Table 4.1</a>). 
  The key to increasing the carbon stocks in ocean ecosystems is thus to move 
  carbon through the small reservoir of the marine biota to the larger reservoirs 
  of dissolved inorganic carbon (the &#147;biological pump&#148;) in ways that 
  will isolate the carbon and prevent its prompt return to the atmosphere. The 
  biological pump serves to move carbon from the atmosphere to the deep oceans, 
  as organisms take up CO<sub>2</sub> by photosynthesis in the surface ocean, 
  and release the carbon when the organic material sinks and is oxidized at depth.</p>
<p>Several researchers have suggested that ocean productivity in major geographical 
  regions is limited by the availability of primary or micronutrients, and that 
  productivity could be increased substantially by artificially providing the 
  limiting nutrients. This might involve providing nitrogen or phosphorus in large 
  quantities, but the quantities to be supplied would be much smaller if growth 
  were limited by a micronutrient. In particular, there is evidence that in large 
  areas of the Southern Ocean productivity is limited by availability of the micronutrient 
  iron. Martin (1990, 1991) suggested that the ocean could be stimulated to take 
  up additional CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere by providing additional iron, 
  and that 300,000 tonnes of iron could result in the removal of 0.8GtC from the 
  atmosphere. Other analyses have suggested that the effect may be more limited. 
  Peng and Broecker (1991) examined the dynamic aspects of this proposal and concluded 
  that, even if the iron hypothesis was completely correct, the dynamic issues 
  of mixing the excess carbon into the deep ocean would limit the magnitude of 
  the impact on the atmosphere. Joos <i>et al</i>. (1991) reported on a similar model 
  experiment and found the ocean dynamics to be less important, the time path 
  of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to be very important, and the maximum 
  potential effect of iron fertilization to be somewhat greater than reported 
  by Peng and Broecker (1991).</p>
<p>Some of the concepts of iron fertilization have now been tested with 2 small-scale 
  experiments in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. In experiment IronEX 1 (November, 
  1993) 480 kg of iron were added over 24 hours to a 64 km<sup>2</sup> area of the equatorial 
  Pacific. In IronEX 2 (May/June, 1995) a similar 450 kg of iron (as acidic iron 
  sulphate) were added over a 72 km<sup>2</sup> area, but the addition occurred in 3 doses 
  over a period of one week.</p>
<p>The IronEx 1 experiment showed unequivocally that there was a biological response 
  to the addition of iron. However, although plant biomass doubled and phytoplankton 
  production increased fourfold, the decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> fugacity (in effect 
  the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> decreased by 10 micro atm) was only about 
  a tenth of that expected (Martin <i>et al</i>., 1994; Watson <i>et al</i>., 1994; Wells, 1994). 
  In the IronEX 2 experiment the abundance and growth rate of phytoplankton increased 
  dramatically (by greater than 20 and twice, respectively), nitrate decreased 
  by half, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were significantly reduced (the fugacity 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> was down 90matm on day 9). Within a week of the last fertilization, 
  however, the phytoplankton bloom had waned, the iron concentration had decreased 
  below ambient, and there was no sign that the iron was retained and recycled 
  in the surface waters (Monastersky, 1995; Coale <i>et al</i>., 1996; Cooper <i>et al</i>., 
  1996; Frost, 1996).</p>
<p>These two experiments have demonstrated that week-long, sustained additions 
  of iron to nutrient-rich, but iron-poor, regions of the ocean can produce massive 
  phytoplankton blooms and large drawdowns of CO<sub>2</sub> and nutrients. While 
  the results of these two experiments cannot be uncritically extrapolated, they 
  suggest a very important role for iron in the cycling of carbon (Cooper <i>et al</i>., 
  1996). The consequences of larger, longer-term introductions of iron remain 
  uncertain. Concerns that have been expressed relate to the differential impact 
  on different algal species, the impact on concentrations of dimethyl sulphide 
  in surface waters, and the potential for creating anoxic regions at depth (Coale 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996; Frost, 1996; Turner <i>et al</i>., 1996). There is much to be learned 
  of the ecological consequences of large-scale fertilization of the ocean. </p>
<p>Jones and Young (1998) suggest that the addition of reactive nitrogen in appropriate 
  areas, perhaps in conjunction with trace nutrients, would increase production 
  of phytoplankton and could both increase CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and provide a 
  sustainable fishery with greater yield than at present.</p>
<p>Chemical buffering of the oceans to decreases in pH associated with uptake 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> leads to an increase in dissolved inorganic carbon that does 
  not rely on alteration of the biological pump. Buffering of the oceans is enhanced 
  by dissolution of alkaline minerals. Dissolution of alkaline materials in ocean 
  sediments with rising pH occurs in nature, but does so on a time-scale of thousands 
  of years or more (Archer <i>et al</i>., 1997). Intentional dissolution of mined minerals 
  has been considered, but the quantity (in moles) of dissolved minerals would 
  be comparable to the quantity of additional carbon taken up by the oceans (Kheshgi, 
  1995).</p>
<p>Stallard (1998) has shown that human modifications of the earth&#146;s surface 
  may be leading to increased carbon stocks in lakes, water reservoirs, paddy 
  fields, and flood plains as deposited sediments. Burial of 0.6 to 1.5GtC/yr 
  may be possible theoretically. Although Stallard (1998) does not suggest intentional 
  manipulation for the purpose of increasing carbon stocks, it is clear that human 
  activities are likely leading to carbon sequestration in these environments 
  already, that there are opportunities to manage carbon via these processes, 
  and that the rate of carbon sequestration could be either increased or decreased 
  as a consequence of human decisions on how to manage the hydrological cycle 
  and sedimentation processes.</p>
<p>The term &#147;geo-engineering&#148; has been used to characterize large-scale, 
  deliberate manipulations of earth environments (NAS, 1992; Marland, 1996; Flannery 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997). Keith (2001) emphasizes that it is the deliberateness that distinguishes 
  geo-engineering from other large-scale, human impacts on the global environment; 
  impacts such as those that result from large-scale agriculture, global forestry 
  activities, or fossil fuel combustion. Management of the biosphere, as discussed 
  in this chapter, has sometimes been included under the heading of geo-engineering 
  (e.g., NAS, 1992) although the original usage of the term geo-engineering was 
  in reference to a proposal to collect CO<sub>2</sub> at power plants and inject 
  it into deep ocean waters (Marchetti, 1976). The concept of geo-engineering 
  also includes the possibility of engineering the earth&#146;s climate system 
  by large-scale manipulation of the global energy balance. It has been estimated, 
  for example, that the mean effect on the earth surface energy balance from a 
  doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> could be offset by an increase of 1.5% to 2% in the 
  earth&#146;s albedo, i.e. by reflecting additional incoming solar radiation 
  back into space. Because these later concepts offer a potential approach for 
  mitigating changes in the global climate, and because they are treated nowhere 
  else in this volume, these additional geo-engineering concepts are introduced 
  briefly here.</p>
<p>Summaries by Early (1989), NAS (1992), and Flannery <i>et al</i>. (1997) consider 
  a variety of ways by which the albedo of the earth might be increased to try 
  to compensate for an increase in the concentration of infrared absorbing gases 
  in the atmosphere (see also Dickinson, 1996). The possibilities include atmospheric 
  aerosols, reflective balloons, and space mirrors. Most recently, work by Teller 
  <i>et al</i>. (1997) has re-examined the possibility of optical scattering, either 
  in space or in the stratosphere, to alter the earth&#146;s albedo and thus to 
  modulate climate. The latter work captures the essence of the concept and is 
  summarized briefly here to provide an example of what is envisioned. In agreement 
  with the 1992 NAS study, Teller <i>et al</i>. (1997) found that ~10<sup>7</sup>t of dielectric 
  aerosols of ~100 nm diameter would be sufficient to increase the albedo of the 
  earth by ~1%. They showed that the required mass of a system based on alumina 
  particles would be similar to that of a system based on sulphuric acid aerosol, 
  but the alumina particles offer different environmental impact. In addition, 
  Teller <i>et al</i>. (1997) demonstrate that use of metallic or optically resonant 
  scatterers can, in principle, greatly reduce the required total mass of scattering 
  particles required. Two configurations of metal scatterers that were analyzed 
  in detail are mesh microstructures and micro-balloons. Conductive metal mesh 
  is the most mass-efficient configuration. The thickness of the mesh wires is 
  determined by the skin-depth of optical radiation in the metal, about 20 nm, 
  and the spacing of wires is determined by the wavelength of scattered light, 
  about 300nm. In principle, only ~10<sup>5</sup>t of such mesh structures are required to 
  achieve the benchmark 1% increase in albedo. The proposed metal balloons have 
  diameters of ~4 mm and a skin thickness of ~20nm. They are hydrogen filled and 
  are designed to float at altitudes of ~25km. The total mass of the balloon system 
  would be ~10<sup>6</sup>t. Because of the much longer stratospheric residence time of the 
  balloon system, the required mass flux (e.g., tonnes replaced per year) to sustain 
  the two systems would be comparable. Finally, Teller <i>et al</i>. (1997) show that 
  either system, if fabricated in aluminium, can be designed to have long stratospheric 
  lifetimes yet oxidize rapidly in the troposphere, ensuring that few particles 
  are deposited on the surface. </p>
<p>One of the perennial concerns about possibilities for modifying the earth&#146;s 
  radiation balance has been that even if these methods could compensate for increased 
  GHGs in the global and annual mean, they might have very different spatial and 
  temporal effects and impact the regional and seasonal climates in a very different 
  way than GHGs. Recent analyses using the CCM3 climate model (Govindasamy and 
  Caldeira, 2000) suggest, however, that a 1.7% decrease in solar luminosity would 
  closely counterbalance a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> at the regional and seasonal 
  scale (in addition to that at the global and annual scale) despite differences 
  in radiative forcing patterns. </p>
<p>It is unclear whether the cost of these novel scattering systems would be less 
  than that of the older proposals, as is claimed by Teller <i>et al</i>. (1997), because 
  although the system mass would be less, the scatterers may be much more costly 
  to fabricate. However, it is unlikely that cost would play an important role 
  in the decision to deploy such a system. Even if we accept the higher cost estimates 
  of the NAS (1992) study, the cost may be very small compared to the cost of 
  other mitigation options (Schelling, 1996). It is likely that issues of risk, 
  politics (Bodansky, 1996), and environmental ethics (Jamieson, 1996) will prove 
  to be the decisive factors in real choices about implementation. The importance 
  of the novel scattering systems is not in minimizing cost, but in their potential 
  to minimize risk. Two of the key problems with earlier proposals were the potential 
  impact on atmospheric chemistry, and the change in the ratio of direct to diffuse 
  solar radiation, and the associated whitening of the visual appearance of the 
  sky. The proposals of Teller el al. (1997) suggest that the location, scattering 
  properties, and chemical reactivity of the scatterers could, in principle, be 
  tuned to minimize both of these impacts. Nonetheless, most papers on geo-engineering 
  contain expressions of concern about unexpected environmental impacts, our lack 
  of complete understanding of the systems involved, and concerns with the legal 
  and ethical implications (NAS, 1992; Flannery <i>et al</i>., 1997; Keith, 2000). Unlike 
  other strategies, geo-engineering addresses the symptoms rather than the causes 
  of climate change.</p>
