<h3>10.2.8 Implementation and Compliance</h3>
<p>Since SAR, political science analysis in the field of effectiveness and implementation 
  of international environmental agreements has focused on the process of implementation. 
  That is, how intent is translated into action to solve international environmental 
  problems and what are the real effects of these efforts (Sand, 1992; Haas <i>et 
  al</i>., 1993; Young, 1994, 1999; Brown Weiss and Jacobson, 1998; Victor <i>et 
  al</i>., 1998). Analysts distinguish &#147;implementation&#148; and &#147;compliance&#148; 
  (Chayes and Chayes, 1993, 1995; Mitchel, 1994; Jacobson and Brown Weiss, 1995; 
  Cameron <i>et al</i>., 1996; Underdal, 1998; Victor <i>et al</i>., 1998; Brown 
  Weiss, 1999). See <a href="#box101">Box 10.1</a>. for the definition of political 
  science terms.</p>

  <tr> 
    <td class="box"><b>Box 10.1. Definitions of Political Science Terms </b> 
      <p><b>Implementation</b><br>
        Implementation refers to the actions (legislation or regulations, judicial 
        decrees, or other actions) that governments take to translate international 
        accords into domestic law and policy (Jacobson and Brown Weiss, 1995; 
        Underdal, 1998; Brown Weiss, 1999). It includes those events and activities 
        that occur after authoritative public policy directives have been issued, 
        such as the effort to administer the substantive impacts on people and 
        events (Mazmanian and Sabatier, 1983). It is important to distinguish 
        between the legal implementation of international commitments (in national 
        law) and the effective implementation (measures that induce changes in 
        the behaviour of target groups; see Z&uuml;rn, 1996).</p>
      <p><b>Compliance</b><br>
        Compliance is a matter of whether and to what extent countries do adhere 
        to the provisions of the accord (Jacobson and Brown Weiss, 1995; Underdal, 
        1998). The concept of compliance includes implementation, but it is generally 
        broader. Compliance focuses not only on whether implementing measures 
        are in effect, but also on whether there is compliance with the implementing 
        actions. Compliance measures the degree to which the actors whose behaviour 
        is targetted by the agreement (whether they be local government units, 
        corporations, organizations, or individuals) conform to the implementing 
        measures and obligations (Brown Weiss, 1999).</p>
      <p><b>Effectiveness</b><br>
        Effectiveness measures the degree to which international environmental 
        accords lead to changes of behaviour that help to solve environmental 
        problems, that is the extent to which the commitment has actually influenced 
        behaviour in a way that advances the goals that inspired the commitment 
        (Victor <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
      <p><b>Enforcement</b><br>
        Enforcement refers to the actions taken once violations occur. It is customarily 
        associated with the availability of formal dispute settlement procedures 
        and with penalties, sanctions, or other coercive measures to induce compliance 
        with obligations. Enforcement is part of the compliance process (Brown 
        Weiss, 1999).<br>

<p>Although compliance is an important matter for the outcome of an agreement, 
  it has to be distinguished from the effectiveness of the accord (Underdal, 1998; 
  Victor <i>et al</i>., 1998; Brown Weiss, 1999; Young, 1999). This refers to 
  the extent to which the commitment actually influences behaviour in a way that 
  advances the goals that inspired the commitment.</p>
<p>Discussions are underway on how to enforce international commitments, that 
  is to make parties to the international treaties conform with their international 
  obligations through application of various tools (penalties, sanctions, etc.). 
  Some researchers argue that enforcement might be especially difficult in international 
  systems and, thus, is often unlikely unless a party persistently fails to comply<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#18","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>18</sup></small></a>.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#18","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small></small></a> 
  Besides, non-compliance is frequently the product of incomplete planning and 
  miscalculation rather than a wilful act (Victor <i>et al</i>., 1998). Thus, 
  enforcement is often contrasted to the management of non-compliance and implementation 
  failures (non-compliance is a problem to be solved, not an action to be punished), 
  which includes greater transparency, non-adversarial forms of dispute resolution, 
  technical and economic assistance, persuasion, and negotiation (Haas <i>et al</i>., 
  1993; Chayes and Chayes, 1995; Sand, 1995; Downs <i>et al</i>., 1996; Z&uuml;rn, 
  1996; Peterson, 1997; Victor <i>et al</i>., 1998; Vogel and Kessler, 1998). 
  However, there are also good reasons to consider coercive &#147;enforcement&#148; 
  techniques&#150;in cases of severe violations they may be more effective. In 
  this debate, standard solutions do not exist and a mixed approach seems to be 
  reasonable.</p>
<p>The challenge today is how decisions regarding compliance and implementation 
  of the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol should be undertaken to make these international 
  mechanisms more effective in solving the problems of both combatting global 
  climate change and changes in the behaviour of the targets (Victor and Salt, 
  1995; O&#146;Riordan and J&auml;ger, 1996; O&#146;Riordan, 1997; Soroos, 1997; 
  Grubb <i>et al</i>., 1999). Two crucial aspects of decision-making regarding 
  implementation of the international climate change regime are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>how national governments have translated international commitments into 
    national rules and policies, and promote changes in behaviour of stakeholders; 
    and<br>
  </li>
  <li>how international institutions have aided monitoring of implementation and 
    compliance, adherence to commitments, and adjustment of international rules 
    by the parties.</li>
</ul>
