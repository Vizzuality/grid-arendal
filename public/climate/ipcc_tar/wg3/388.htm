<h4>10.1.3.2 Summary of the Second Assessment Report</h4>
<p>SAR divided its discussion of DMFs into four sections&#150;an introduction, 
  a discussion of the context of decision making, a discussion of the tools for 
  decision analysis, and concluded by considering the implications for national 
  decision-making in the context of the UNFCCC. The chapter began by discussing 
  the features of climate change that distinguish it from other environmental 
  problems. It then described decision analysis and the present state-of-the-art.</p>
<p>Decision analysis uses quantitative techniques to identify the &#147;best&#148; 
  choice from among a range of alternatives. Model-based decision analysis tools 
  are often used as part of interactive techniques in which stakeholders structure 
  problems and encode judgements explicitly in subjective-preference scales. It 
  makes the major trade-offs explicit. Although decision analysis can generate 
  an explicit value as a basis for choice, it is based on a range of relevant 
  monetary and non-monetary criteria. It is used to explore the decision and to 
  generate improved options that are well balanced in the major objectives and 
  that are robust with respect to different futures. A review of the real world 
  limitations of quantitative decision models and the consistency of their theoretical 
  assumptions with climate change decision-making highlighted the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no single decision maker in climate change. As a result of differences 
    in values and objectives, parties that participate in a collective decision-making 
    process do not apply the same criteria to the choice of alternatives. Consequently, 
    decision analysis cannot yield a universally preferred solution.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Decision analysis requires a consistent utility valuation of decision outcomes. 
    In climate change, many decision outcomes are difficult to value.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Decision analysis may help keep the information content of the climate change 
    problem within the cognitive limits of decision makers. Without the structure 
    of decision analysis, climate change information becomes cognitively unmanageable, 
    which limits the ability of decision makers to analyze the outcomes of alternative 
    actions rationally. Quantitative comparisons among decision options (and their 
    attributes) are implied by choices between options (the concept of &#147;revealed 
    preference&#148; in economics). Better decisions are made when these quantitative 
    comparisons are explicit rather than implicit.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The treatment of uncertainty in decision analysis is quite powerful, but 
    the probabilities of uncertain decision outcomes must be quantifiable. In 
    climate change, objective probabilities have not been established for many 
    of the outcomes. In real-world applications subjective probabilities are used.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The large uncertainties and differences between parties may mean there can 
    be no &#147;globally&#148; optimal climate-change strategy; nevertheless, 
    the factors that affect the optimal strategies for single decision makers 
    still have relevance to individual parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of an individual decision maker, utility problems, and incomplete 
  information suggest that decision analysis cannot replace the political process 
  for international climate-change decision-making. Although elements of the technique 
  have considerable value in framing the decision problem and identifying its 
  critical features, decision analysis cannot identify globally optimal choices 
  for climate change abatement. Decision analysis suffers fewer problems when 
  used by individual countries to identify optimal national policies.</p>
<p>The UNFCCC establishes a collective decision-making process within which the 
  parties negotiate future actions. Although some features of the decision-making 
  process are set out in the Convention, many are still undecided. It becomes 
  important, then, to examine negotiation and compromise as the primary basis 
  for climate change decisions under the Convention. Important factors that affect 
  negotiated decisions include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Excessive knowledge requirements in negotiated environmental decisions may 
    impede a collective rational choice. This difficulty could be reduced by making 
    the negotiation process itself more manageable through the use of tools like 
    stakeholder analysis or by splitting accords into more easily managed clusters 
    of agreements.<br>
  </li>
  <li>In the face of long-term uncertainties, sequential decision-making allows 
    actions to be better matched to outcomes by incorporating additional information 
    over time. Sequential decision-making also minimizes harmful strategic behaviour 
    among multiple decision makers.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Improved information about uncertain outcomes may have very high economic 
    value, especially if that information can create future decision options.<br>
  </li>
  <li>There are currently no effective mechanisms for sharing the risks related 
    to climate change and their associated economic burdens. International risk 
    sharing could yield substantial benefits for global economic and social welfare.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Convention is, first and foremost, a framework for collective decision 
  making by sovereign states. Given this collective decision mechanism and the 
  uncertainties inherent in the climate problem, several recommendations emerge:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>decisions for actions under the UNFCCC are rather being taken sequentially 
    to benefit from the gradual reduction in uncertainties;<br>
  </li>
  <li>countries may implement a portfolio of mitigation, adaptation, and research 
    measures;<br>
  </li>
  <li>they may adjust this portfolio continuously in response to new knowledge 
    (the value of better information is potentially very large); and<br>
  </li>
  <li>efficient distribution of the risks of losses related to climate change 
    may warrant new insurance mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
