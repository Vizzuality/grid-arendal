<h4>3.5.3.2 Fuel Switching</h4>
<p>In general not much attention is paid to fuel switching in the manufacturing 
  industry. Fuel choice to a large extent is sector dependent (coal for dominant 
  processes in the iron and steel industry, oil products in large sectors in the 
  chemical industry). Nevertheless, there seems to be some potential. This may 
  be illustrated by the figures presented in <a href="#tab320">Table 3.20</a> 
  where &#150; per sector &#150; the average carbon intensity of fuels used in 
  industry is compared to the country with the lowest carbon intensity. This indicates 
  that fuel switching within fossil fuels can reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  by 10%&#150;20%. However, it is not clear whether the switch is feasible in 
  practical situations, or what the costs are. However, there are specific options 
  that combine fuel switching with energy efficiency improvement. Examples are: 
  the replacement of oil- and coal-fired boilers by natural-gas fired combined 
  heat and power (CHP) plant; the replacement of oil-based partial oxidation processes 
  for ammonia production by natural-gas based steam reforming; and the replacement 
  of coal-based blast furnaces for iron production by natural-gas based direct 
  reduction. Dani&euml;ls and Moll (1998) calculate that costs of this option 
  are high under European energy price conditions. In the case of lower natural 
  gas prices this option may be more attractive.</p>

<h4>3.5.3.3 Renewable Energy</h4>
<p>See <a href="130.htm#3843">Section 3.8.4.3</a> for an extensive assessment of 
  renewable energy technology.</p>
<a name="3534"></a> 
<h4>3.5.3.4 Carbon Dioxide Removal</h4>
<p>Carbon dioxide recovery from flue gases is feasible from industrial processes 
  that are operated on a sufficiently large scale. Costs are comparable with the 
  costs of recovering CO<sub>2</sub> from power plant flue gases. See the discussion 
  of these options in <a href="134.htm#3844">Section 3.8.4.4</a>.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of sectors where cheaper recovery is possible. 
  These typically are processes where hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, 
  leaving CO<sub>2</sub> as a by-product. This is the case in ammonia production 
  (note that some of the CO<sub>2</sub> is already utilized), and increasingly 
  in refineries. Costs can be limited to those of purification, drying and compression. 
  They can be on the order of about US$30/tC avoided (Farla <i>et al</i>., 1995). Another 
  example of carbon dioxide recovery connected to a specific process is the recovery 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> from the calcination of sodium bicarbonate in soda ash production. 
  The company Botash in Botswana recovers and reuses 70% of the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  generated this way (Zhou and Landner, 1999). There are several industrial gas 
  streams with a high CO<sub>2</sub> content from which carbon dioxide recovery 
  theoretically is more efficient than from flue gas (Radgen, 1999). However, 
  there are no technical solutions yet to realize this (Farla <i>et al</i>., 1995).</p>
<a name="3535"></a> 
<h4>3.5.3.5 Material Efficiency Improvement</h4>
<p>In heavy industry most of the energy is used to produce a limited number of 
  primary materials, like steel, cement, plastic, paper, etc. Apart from process 
  changes that directly reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the processes, 
  also the limitation of the use of these primary materials can help in reducing 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of these processes. A range of options is available: 
  material efficient product design (Brezet and van Hemel, 1997); material substitution; 
  product recycling; material recycling; quality cascading; and good housekeeping 
  (Worrell <i>et al</i>., 1995b). A review of such options is given in a report for the 
  UN (1997). </p>
<p>An interesting integral approach to material efficiency improvement is the 
  suggestion of the &#147;inverse factory&#148; that does not transfer the ownership 
  of goods to the consumers, but just gives the right of use, taking back the 
  product after use for the purpose of reuse or recycling (Kashiwagi <i>et al</i>., 1999).</p>
<p>Some quantitative studies are available on the possible effects of material 
  efficiency improvement. For the USA, Ruth and Dell&#146; Anno (1997) calculate 
  that the effect of increased glass recycling on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is 
  limited. According to these authors, light-weighting of container glass products 
  may be more promising. In addition, Hekkert <i>et al</i>. (2000) show that product 
  recycling of glass bottles (instead of recycling the material to make new products) 
  is also a promising way to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
<p>For packaging plastics it is estimated that more efficient design (e.g., use 
  of thinner sheets) and waste plastic recycling could lead to savings of about 
  30% on the related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Hekkert <i>et al</i>. (2000) found 
  a technical potential for CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction for the <i>total</i> 
  packaging sector (including paper, wood, and metals) of about 50%. </p>
<p>Worrell <i>et al</i>. (1995c) estimate that more efficient use of fertilizer by, e.g., 
  improved agricultural practices and slow release fertilizer, in the Netherlands 
  may lead to a reduction of fertilizer use by 40%.</p>
<p>Closed-loop cement recycling is not yet technically possible (UN, 1997). A 
  more important option for reducing both energy-related and process emissions 
  in the cement industry is the use of blended cements, where clinker as input 
  is replaced by, e.g., blast furnace slag or fly ash from coal combustion. Taking 
  into account the regional availability of such inputs and maximum replacement, 
  it is estimated that about 5%&#150;20% of total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 
  the cement industry can be avoided. Costs of these alternative materials are 
  generally lower than those of clinker (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme, 
  1999). Note that these figures are based on a static analysis for the year 1990 
  (Worrell <i>et al</i>., 1995a).</p>
<p>Some integral approaches give an overview of the total possible impact of changes 
  in the material system. Gielen (1999) has modelled the total Western European 
  materials and energy system, using a linear optimization model (Markal). In 
  a baseline scenario emissions of greenhouse gases in the year 2030 are projected 
  to be 5000 MtC<sub>eq</sub>. At a cost of US$200/tC 10% of these emissions can 
  be avoided through &#147;material options&#148;; at a cost of US$800/tC this 
  increases to 20%. Apart from &#147;end-of-pipe&#148; options, especially material 
  substitution is important, e.g., replacement of petrochemical feedstocks by 
  biomass feedstocks (see also <a href="155.htm">Chapter 4</a>); steel by aluminium 
  in the transport sector; and concrete by wood in the buildings sector. At higher 
  costs, waste management options (energy recovery, plastics recycling) are also 
  selected by the model. Gielen (1999) notes that in his analysis the effect of 
  material efficiency of product design is underestimated.</p>
<p>A study for the UN (1997) estimates that the effect of material efficiency 
  improvement in an &#147;<i>ecologically-driven/advanced technology</i>&#148; 
  scenario in the year 2020 could make up a difference of 40 EJ in world primary 
  energy demand (approximately 7% of the baseline energy use), which is equivalent 
  to over 600 Mt of carbon emissions.</p>
