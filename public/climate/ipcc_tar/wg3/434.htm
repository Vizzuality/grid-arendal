<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>Emission reduction is recognized as attacking the immediate cause. However, 
  the political and scientific discussion would certainly gain by broadening it 
  beyond the issue of mitigation, if only because past emissions of GHGs together 
  with their long atmospheric lifetime leave the earth with unavoidable adverse 
  climate change impacts, irrespective of current mitigation actions (see Smith, 
  1997; Jepma and Munasinghe, 1998; Rayner and Malone, 1998b).</p>
<p>Even if mitigation efforts do succeed, adaptation strategies are considered 
  to be reasonable because ancillary benefits independent of climate change might 
  result (Pielke, 1998). Exploring adaptation strategies and the way in which 
  people in &#147;homes, factories, and fields&#148; can be empowered institutionally 
  and technologically to change their practice of living may, next to the generation 
  of short-term benefits, contribute to substantial emission reductions, as well 
  as to the development of strategies to cope with general aspects of global change 
  and thus improve their ability to flexible (re)action. Hence, bottom-up analysis 
  can be viewed as a necessary complementary tool in examining climate impacts 
  with respect to top-down schemes employed in the derivation of national GHG 
  emission reduction targets conducted by expert groups (Rayner and Malone, 1998a).</p>
<p>It is recognized increasingly that the impacts of global climate change are 
  not determined solely by the physical characteristics of events. They also depend 
  on the society&#146;s ability to adapt to changing patterns of the geophysical 
  environment, as indicated by the analyses of documented impacts of historical 
  climate hazards (Meyer <i>et al</i>., 1998). Larger damages and higher losses of life 
  are caused by extreme weather events in poor regions compared to similar events 
  in affluent regions. Thus damages are not only a function of climatic change 
  patterns. They are strongly influenced by economic, institutional, and technical 
  development, which determine the capacity to adapt to changing patterns, as 
  well as by exogenous shifts in socioeconomic conditions, such as population 
  growth (Tol and Fankhauser, 1998).</p>
<p>The challenge is to find the right balance of adaptation and mitigation measures 
  that represents an effective and complementary response strategy to climate 
  change. For this purpose it is important to recognize the potential economic 
  trade-off between mitigation and adaptation strategies. This trade-off entails 
  the use of scarce resources in mitigation activities, like restructuring a nation&#146;s 
  energy system, versus adaptation strategies, like protection against changing 
  flood and/or drought patterns or sea-level rise. More generally, the trade-off 
  implies greater or lesser stresses from climate change to be adapted to, depending 
  on the level of mitigation effort. The question then is to what extent governments 
  should focus on mitigation and adaptation strategies, recognizing that adaptation 
  and mitigation decisions would generally not be made by the same entities. This 
  implies that the search for the best possible combination of adaptation and 
  mitigation strategies is a complex process.</p>
<p>Several approaches from different angles are possible to answer this question. 
  From an economic point of view, the task is to compare the marginal costs and 
  benefits of both strategies, and&#151;in an optimization framework&#151;minimize 
  the overall welfare loss or macroeconomic costs. Following the heuristic principle 
  of precaution would imply precautionary investments in both mitigation and adaptation 
  to hedge against the uncertainties involved in climate change. However, there 
  is little guidance in the discussion of the precautionary approach regarding 
  how to operationalize critical levels of GHG emissions. Furthermore, the success 
  of climate change policy depends on institutional structures and constraints 
  that need to be analyzed with respect to the feasibility of mitigation and/or 
  adaptation strategies.</p>
