<h4>10.3.4.3 Participatory Forms of Decision-making</h4>
<p>A substantial body of work on participatory approaches to the decision making 
  process has emerged in the 1990s. Theoretical roots of this resurgence originate 
  in the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory and, more concretely, in Habermas&#146; 
  ideas of discursive ethics (Habermas, 1979; O&#146;Hara, 1996). Discursive ethics 
  views rationality as a social construction, inseparably linked to and informed 
  by the human experience of a social, cultural, and ecological life world, which 
  constitutes the context of human experience. It presupposes no norms other than 
  the acceptance of a reasoned, reflective, and practical potential for discourse: 
  that is, the mutual recognition and acceptance of others as &#147;response-able&#148; 
  subjects (O&#146;Hara, 1996). The main contribution of discursive ethics is 
  to offer a conceptual framework for making visible the hidden normative assumptions, 
  behaviours, and motivations that influence de facto decision-making and valuation 
  processes.</p>
<p>Despite the resurgence of interest in public participation, no widely accepted 
  consistent method has emerged to evaluate the success of individual processes 
  or the desirability of many participatory methods. Diverse perspectives together 
  with country-specific conditions favour different forms of participation. In 
  most developed societies, participatory discourse has been motivated by public 
  concerns on the rigid and constraining forms of technocratic decision-making 
  practices, and their institutionalized forms of bureaucracy and social control. 
  Following Beierle (1998), divergent models of the role of civil society in decision 
  making arise from differences of view on the nature of democracy. A managerial 
  perspective acknowledges public preferences as vital to the managerial role 
  of democratic institutions in identifying and pursuing the common good, but 
  public participation in decision making conveys the threat of self-interested 
  strategic behaviour. Under a pluralistic perspective there is no objective &#147;common 
  good&#148;, but a relative common good that arises out of the free deliberation 
  and negotiation among organized interest groups. The role of the government 
  is arbitration among these groups. Lastly, a popular perspective calls for the 
  direct participation of citizens as a mechanism to instil democratic values 
  in citizens and strengthen the body politic. Each view provides different forms 
  of participation: the managerial perspective may favour information flow mechanisms, 
  such as surveys or the provision of right-to-know information; the pluralist 
  perspective prefers stakeholder mediation; and the popular perspective favours 
  citizen advisory groups (Beierle, 1998).</p>
<p>Participatory forms in decision making carry a distinct connotation in developing 
  countries. They are rooted in the idea of grassroots participation, promoted 
  by international development aid agencies since 1990 (UNDP, 1992). The concept 
  is far from new, but in recent years it has received a different connotation. 
  Before, participation was considered as an extension of partnership between 
  governmental institutions and development institutions at the operational level. 
  The scheme was oriented mainly to relieve the state of some of its executorial 
  responsibilities without any effective form of decisional decentralization (Lazarev, 
  1994). Participatory development as it is envisaged today aims to renew these 
  ideas of partnership, but to give due recognition to the role of local populations 
  by letting them generate, share, and analyze information, establish priorities, 
  specify objectives, and develop tactics (World Bank, 1996). It is viewed as 
  a social learning process within which stakeholders, by generating and internalizing 
  their own aspirations, themselves enable a social change process.</p>
