<h2>10.2 International Regimes and Policy Options </h2>
<h3><a name="1021"></a>10.2.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>Previous chapters provide some answers to the most relevant policy questions 
  related to the climate change problem. Issues such as the timing of optimal 
  responses to climate change, the role of technological innovation and diffusion, 
  the choice between domestic action and the adoption of &#147;Kyoto mechanisms&#148;, 
  the importance of co- and ancillary benefits, etc., have been analyzed from 
  different perspectives. However, it is important to notice that the costs and 
  benefits of all the above options crucially depend on the characteristics of 
  the international agreement on climate change that is adopted. In particular, 
  they depend upon two main features of the international regime: the number of 
  signatories, and the size of their quantitative commitment to control GHG emissions.</p>
<p>It is therefore impossible to assess the costs and benefits of the Kyoto Protocol 
  or of other potential agreements on climate change independently of the number 
  of signatories of the agreement and of their abatement targets and/or policy 
  commitment. However, the number of signatories is endogenous and depends on 
  the abatement targets and mitigation polices adopted in various countries. Hence 
  the weakness of most of the available literature on costs and benefits of climate 
  change policies, which widely neglects the full interdependency between policies, 
  costs&#150;benefits, and signatories (more generally, the structure of the international 
  agreements). For example, studies analyze the costs of implementing the Kyoto 
  Protocol either through a set of domestic policies and measures or through a 
  system of international tradable permits, with a fixed number of signatories. 
  But the adoption of either policy crucially affects the number of signatories, 
  which can be larger or lower under policies and measures than under tradable 
  permits. And the number (and identity) of signatories crucially affects the 
  costs and benefits of different agreements.</p>
<p>Therefore, this section aims to provide an analysis of the effectiveness of 
  climate policies by focusing on the link between policy options on the one hand 
  and the structure of the agreements and international regimes on the other. 
  Some of the most important theoretical results are reviewed first, and then 
  the existing literature is revisited to see which information it provides on 
  the interdependencies described above. In particular, can such an analysis show 
  whether there exist the conditions for an agreement on climate change to be 
  signed by all or almost all world countries (see Carraro, 1998; Carraro and 
  Siniscalco, 1998; and Barrett, 1999 for a theoretical analysis of these conditions)? 
  Also, would it show which countries can play a leadership role with respect 
  to achieving the largest possible coalition by proposing strategies, measures, 
  and institutions that help expand the number of countries that commit to control 
  their emissions (see Grubb and Gupta, 2000)? Notice that in this way we also 
  analyze which strategies can be proposed to reduce the costs of mitigation policies. 
  But this is a quite different approach to those analyzed in the previous sections 
  of this chapter and in <a href="319.htm">Chapters 8</a> and <a href="353.htm">9</a>. 
  The reason is that here a country&#146;s goal is not to identify a new climate 
  friendly technology or an adequate redistribution of costs across sectors. Now 
  the goal is to affect other countries&#146; behaviour to increase the number 
  of those that share the burden, and to share the burden more equitably.</p>
<p>The equity issue is also very important to understand which countries are going 
  to reduce and/or control<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#5","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>5</sup></small></a> 
  their emissions. As a consequence, given what is said above, equity is crucial 
  to assess adequately the costs of emission reductions at the global and country 
  level. It has been argued that some countries are allowed to reduce emissions 
  less than other countries, both within (Kram, 1998) and outside the European 
  Union (EU) bubble (Bosello and Roson, 1999; Metz, 1999; Rose and Stevens, 1999). 
  Even when applying the Kyoto mechanisms, some countries will benefit from the 
  agreements more than other ones (Nordhaus and Boyer, 1999). It has also been 
  argued that some countries can exploit their monopolistic power in a future 
  trading system (Burniaux, 1998). All these remarks address the problem of optimal 
  burden-sharing (the distribution of costs) of climate change control. This problem 
  is strictly related to the features of an international agreement on climate 
  for two main reasons. First, increasing the number of participating countries 
  reduces the direct costs for each signatory; second, an agreement in which the 
  burden is equitably shared is more likely to be signed by a large number of 
  countries (Convery, 1999). Therefore, equity and the structure of the international 
  agreement (number and identity of signatories) are strictly linked. However, 
  the number of signatories affects and is affected by costs. Hence, equity and 
  efficiency cannot be separated.</p>
<p>These remarks reinforce the previous basic statement. An analysis of the costs 
  and benefits of different policy options, and of the distribution of these costs 
  and benefits across countries, cannot be done independently of an analysis of 
  the likely features of the prevailing international regime (i.e., of the incentives 
  that lead countries to sign an international agreement to control GHG emissions 
  and to set quantitative emission targets).</p>
<p>Notice that an analysis of the features of climate international agreements 
  and of their repercussions on the choice of different policy options (and vice 
  versa) must take into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>basic features of the climate problem recalled in <a href="382.htm">Section 
    10.1</a>, and particularly the public-good nature of GHG abatement in the 
    absence of a supranational authority;<br>
  </li>
  <li>scenarios that describe the future evolution of economic and environmental 
    climate-related variables;<br>
  </li>
  <li>economic incentives for countries to sign an international agreement on 
    climate change control, that is under what conditions, in terms of the number 
    of countries, damaging effects of free-riding (leakage), structure of costs 
    and benefits, can a coalition (<i>i.e</i>., a group of signatories of the 
    international agreement) emerge?<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a><br>
  </li>
  <li>the political and institutional dimension of an international climate agreement, 
    its history, the possibility of monitoring and sanctioning deviations, the 
    links with other agreements.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section is devoted to the analysis of the above issues and also aims to 
  provide a framework to understand how future negotiations on climate change 
  can evolve, and how costs and benefits of climate policies are modified by these 
  possible evolutions.</p>
