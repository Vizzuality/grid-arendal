<p>First, it introduces a distinction between the &#147;basic game&#148; itself 
  (<i>i.e</i>., the system of activities to be regulated) and the &#147;policy 
  game&#148; through which decisions about regulations are made. The policy game 
  generates its own stakes; certain kinds of behaviour&#151;notably behaviour 
  that meets the expectations of domestic &#147;clients&#148; and important others&#151;are 
  rewarded, while moves that violate these expectations are punished. Governments 
  also consider such political stakes. Where such stakes exist, a political scientist 
  expects government behaviour to deviate to some degree from what national economic 
  interests indicate. Such deviance may go both ways; the wish to placate politically 
  important domestic &#147;clients&#148; most often leads to a more restrictive 
  policy, while the momentum generated towards the end of a successful international 
  conference can lead a lone &#147;laggard&#148; to go the extra mile to accommodate 
  the majority.</p>
<p>Second, political science emphasizes (more and more) the relevance of &#147;<i>social 
  norms</i>&#148;, &#147;<i>social learning</i>&#148;, and the operation of &#147;<i>social 
  roles</i>&#148; in regime processes (Young, 1999). These approaches recognize 
  that all international environmental regimes are &#147;social institutions&#148; 
  that develop particular (social) dynamics and induce behavioural consequences: 
  the matter of social norms refers to behaviour that roots in considerations 
  of legitimacy or authoritativeness. Actors, who regard the rules of regimes 
  as legitimate, often comply without engaging in detailed calculations of the 
  costs and benefits (of their doing so). One important effect of international 
  regimes is that they initiate social learning processes. Already, the start 
  of global negotiating generally has resulted in the generation of new facts, 
  ideas, and perspectives that reduce uncertainty and lead to changes in the prevailing 
  discourses, values, and actual behaviour of actors. The operation of social 
  roles refers to the observation that actors regularly take on new roles under 
  the terms of institutional arrangements that shape identities and interests.</p>
<p>Third, norms of fairness are assumed to serve as (1) frameworks of soft constraints 
  upon the pursuit of self-interest, and (2) as decision premises in situations 
  in which interests provide no clear guidance. Studying international negotiations 
  we can observe some rather general norms that are frequently invoked and very 
  rarely disputed&#151;at least on principled grounds. These norms seem to constitute 
  a soft core of widely, though probably not universally, accepted ideas about 
  distributive fairness. This core is described in summary fashion below.</p>
<p>The default option in international co-operation is the norm that all parties 
  shall have <i>equal</i> obligations, usually defined in relative terms. The 
  principle of equal obligations has a firm normative basis if all parties involved 
  are roughly equal in all relevant respects. This condition is never met in global 
  negotiations, although it usually applies to subgroups. When the range of variance 
  exceeds a certain threshold, attention shifts to some notion of <i>equity</i>. 
  The common denominator for equity norms is that costs and/or benefits be distributed 
  in (rough) proportion to actor scores on the dimension(s) that led the parties 
  to think about differentiation in the first place. Several such dimensions can 
  be identified, but in international co-operation attention focuses primarily 
  on two. One is the role that each party played in causing the problem or providing 
  the good in question, the other refers to the consequences that a particular 
  obligation or project would have for the various parties involved. This gives 
  a matrix with four key principles (see <a href="#tab103">Table 10.3</a>). In 
  a global setting, however, the range of variance in terms of criteria such as 
  &#147;guilt&#148; or &#147;capacity&#148; is most often so large that even the 
  notion of soft proportionality leads to &#147;unfair&#148; burdens upon the 
  poorest countries. When the latter threshold is reached, attention tends to 
  shift to the simple principle of exemption; more precisely, exemption from any 
  substantive obligation for which a party is not (fully) compensated.</p>

<p>This leaves a somewhat complex and elastic framework, but the bottom line is 
  clear enough. A global agreement has to be at least roughly consistent with 
  (1) the general pattern of differentiation outlined in the preceding paragraph, 
  and (2) the combined implications of the equity principles of &#147;guilt&#148;, 
  &#147;capacity&#148;, and &#147;need&#148; (i.e., implications that can be derived 
  from all three principles).</p>
<p>These points are important to consider in the design of international environmental 
  regimes. Political scientists focus on sociopolitical dimensions and processes 
  that current game-theory models neglect or are unable to capture adequately. 
  Nevertheless, the policy-relevant conclusions from game theory remain valid 
  and useful for the policy process.<br>
