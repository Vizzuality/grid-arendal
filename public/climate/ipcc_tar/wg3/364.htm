<h3>9.2.4 Non-fossil Energy</h3>
<p>This section covers the effects of mitigation on non-fossil-fuel-based energy 
  production and use (electricity and biomass), and the ancillary benefits and 
  costs associated with mitigation using non-fossil energy. </p>
<h4>9.2.4.1 Electricity Use and Production Fuel Mix</h4>
<p>World electricity demand in 1998 was 12.6bn MWh, about 60% of which (7.5bn 
  MWh) was consumed in the industrialized countries (EIA, 2000a). Fossil fuels 
  used for electricity generation account for about one third of the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions from the energy sector worldwide (EIA, 2000b). Globally, about 60% 
  of all electricity is produced with fossil fuels. However, the fraction of electricity 
  generated from fossil fuels varies across countries, from as little as 1% in 
  Norway to 95% in the Middle East, and 97% in Poland (EIA, 2000a). Nuclear reactors 
  are producing electricity with a global capacity of around 351GWe (IAEA, 1997), 
  with each having an average of nearly 800MWe of installed capacity. Half of 
  this total is concentrated in three countries: the USA with 25%, and France 
  and Japan with 12.5% each (IAEA, 1997, pp. 10-11).<br>
</p>
<p> Recent projections show that electricity use will grow 37% to 16.8bn MWh by 
  2010, and 76% to 21.6bn MWh by 2020. About two thirds of this growth will occur 
  outside the developed countries (EIA, 2000b). The IPCC Special Report on Emissions 
  Scenarios (SRES) projections (Nakicenovic <i><i>et al</i></i>., 2000) are similar, 
  with worldwide electricity demand projected to more than double between 1990 
  and 2020 in scenarios A1B, A1F1 and B1, and to double between 1990 and 2020 
  in scenarios A2 and B2. Beyond 2020, the growth in electricity demand projected 
  in the scenarios diverges. A1B shows the highest growth, more than 20 times 
  between 1990 and 2100, while B1 shows the lowest growth, slightly less than 
  6 times between 1990 and 2100.<br>
</p>
<p>Much of this new power will be generated with fossil fuels. Globally, use of 
  gas for electricity generation is projected to more than double by 2020. Global 
  use of coal for generation is projected to grow by more than 50%, with about 
  90% of the projected increase occurring in the developing countries. In Asia, 
  nuclear power is still expected to increase to meet the increasing electric 
  power demand mainly because of resource constraint issues (Aoyama, 1997; Matsuo, 
  1997). <a href="#tab96">Table 9.6</a> shows estimates of nuclear electrical 
  generating capacity by region to 2010.<br>

<p><a name="fig92"></a>Uncertainty is reflected in the wide range in the long-term 
  projections for nuclear energy capacity. The World Energy Council (Nakicenovic 
  <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1998; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at/cgi-bin/ecs/bookdyn/bookcnt.py">http://www.iiasa.ac.at/cgi-bin/ecs/bookdyn/bookcnt.py</a>) 
  projects a range of 2,227 to 11,840 TWh in 2050 under six possible future energy 
  scenarios as shown in <a href="#fig92">Figure 9.2</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="9242"></a>9.2.4.2 Impacts of Mitigation on the Electricity Sector 
</h4>
<p>Given the extensive use of fossil fuel in the production of electricity, it 
  is not surprising that a variety of proposals have been put forth to mitigate 
  GHG emissions in this sector. Many countries have proposed renewable technologies 
  as one solution for GHG mitigation (Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de Energ&iacute;a, 
  1993; SDPC <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1996; Piscitello and Bogach, 1997; European 
  Commission, 1997). In some European countries such as Sweden and Austria, carbon 
  taxes have been introduced. In Japan, nuclear power is planned to supply 480TWh 
  in 2010, or 17.4% of total primary energy supply, to help meet the Kyoto target 
  (Fujime, 1998). In contrast, in Sweden, a policy under debate to phase out nuclear 
  power and restrict CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to 1990 levels by other means would 
  result in significantly higher electricity prices (Anderson and Haden, 1997) 
  <br>
</p>
<p>In general, mitigation policies work through two routes. First, they either 
  mandate or directly provide incentives for increased use of zero-emitting technologies 
  (such as nuclear, hydro, and other renewables) and lower-GHG-emitting generation 
  technologies (such as combined cycle natural gas). Or, second, indirectly they 
  drive their increased use by more flexible approaches that place a tax on or 
  require a permit for emission of GHGs. Either way, the result will be a shift 
  in the mix of fuels used to generate electricity towards increased use of the 
  zero- and lower-emitting generation technologies, and away from the higher-emitting 
  fossil fuels (Criqui <i><i>et al</i></i>., 2000). <br>
</p>
<p>Quantitative analyses of these impacts are somewhat limited. <a href="356.htm#tab91">Table 
  9.1</a> presents published results from multisectoral models. Other multi-regional 
  models used to assess the impacts of GHG reduction policies appear to have the 
  capability to quantify these impacts on the electricity sector (Bernstein <i><i>et 
  al</i></i>., 1999; Cooper <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1999; Kainuma <i><i>et al</i></i>., 
  1999a, b and c; Kurosawa <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1999; MacCracken <i><i>et al</i></i>., 
  1999; McKibbin <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1999; Tulpule <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1999). 
  However, the focus of the studies conducted with these models has generally 
  been on broader economy-wide impacts, and many do not report results for the 
  electricity sector. McKibbin <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1999) reported the price 
  and quantity impacts on electric utilities if the USA unilaterally implements 
  its Kyoto commitments. Under this scenario, electricity prices in the USA increase 
  7.2% in 2010 and 12.6% in 2020, while demand drops 6.2% and 9.5% in those years, 
  respectively. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE, 
  1995) reported shifts in fuel share for Annex B under a policy where this group 
  of countries stabilizes emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. They show that the 
  share of coal in the generation of electricity for most Annex B countries would 
  drop by 10% to 50%, with the combined shares for nuclear and renewables increasing 
  14 to 46%<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#8","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>8</sup></small></a>. 
  (See <a href="#tab97">Table 9.7</a> for detailed results.) They note that such 
  a policy may require substantial structural changes in the industry and are 
  likely to involve significant costs, but do not elaborate or quantify.<br>

<p>There are a number of analyses for the USA only that report detailed impacts 
  on the electricity sector. Charles River Associates (CRA) and Data Resources 
  International (DRI) (1994) assessed the potential impact of carbon taxes of 
  US$50, $100, and $200 per tonne carbon, phased in to these levels over 1995 
  to 2000. By 2010, imposition of such taxes has increased prices of electricity 
  by 13%, 27%, and 55% for the US$50, $100, and $200 tax, while sales dropped 
  8%, 14%, and 74%, respectively. <br>
</p>
<p>More recently, a group of studies assessing the impacts of the Kyoto Protocol 
  on the US have reported electricity sector impacts (EIA, 1998; WEFA, 1998; DRI, 
  1998). These studies all use a flexible mechanism, such as tradable emissions 
  permits, as the implementation policy. Taken together, the studies reflect a 
  range of assumptions about the level of emissions reductions that would need 
  to come from the domestic energy sector. The range of results for the EIA study 
  for 2010 is summarized here, however, the results from all three studies are 
  generally consistent. Key impacts in 2010, all of which increase as emissions 
  reduction requirements increase, include the following. <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Electricity prices were projected to increase 20% to 86% above baseline 
    levels.</li>
  <li>Electricity demand was projected to decrease 4% to 17% below baseline levels. 
  </li>
  <li>Prices of natural gas were projected to increase by 35% to 206% over the 
    baseline levels. Prices of coal for electricity production were projected 
    to increase to about 2.5 to 9 times the baseline levels. And, despite a 7% 
    to 40% decrease in fossil generation, fossil fuel expenditures increase 81% 
    to 238% over baseline levels. </li>
  <li>About 9% to 43% of total generation will shift away from coal relative to 
    the baseline. The large shift over this limited time period would reflect 
    significant structural changes and potentially large stranded costs. Roughly 
    half of this is replaced by natural gas generation, while most of the remainder 
    is not replaced as a result of reduced demand. Renewable generation beyond 
    baseline levels generally does not enter the mix until at least 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the studies quantify the potential stranded costs associated with the 
  premature retirement of existing generation.</p>
