<h4>8.2.2.1.4 Conclusions: Interest and Limits of Aggregate Analysis</h4>
<p>A lesson from this section is that, despite their great diversity, the findings 
  of empirical models confirm the theoretical diagnosis. Revenue-raising instruments 
  such as carbon taxes or auctioned emissions permits are, if properly utilized, 
  the most efficient instrument for minimizing the aggregate welfare losses (or 
  maximizing the welfare gains) of climate policies.<br>
  <br>
  It should be noted however, that, even if the only one available study for China 
  suggests that opportunities for revenue recycling exist in developing countries, 
  no swapping generalization can be made at this stage. While theoretical modelling 
  and empirical evidence suggest that such opportunities are available in many 
  OECD countries, developing countries in many cases start from a different fiscal 
  baseline (e.g., fewer entrenched distortionary payroll taxes). They also have 
  other potentially underused tax bases that may become more developed as their 
  economies grow at rates that typically exceed growth rates in OECD countries. 
  In developing countries, direct welfare losses associated with a carbon tax 
  may, therefore, reduce opportunities for mitigation within the fiscal reform 
  policy envelope. At this stage, however, insufficient evidence exists either 
  to confirm or to substantiate these hypotheses; studies to date have mainly 
  concentrated on developed countries and their conclusions may not be directly 
  transferable.</p>
<p>Beyond controversies about the capacity of government to warrant fiscal neutrality, 
  that is the fact that the total fiscal burden remains unchanged, the adoption 
  of carbon taxes or auctioned permits confronts the fact that their enforcement 
  must be done in the heterogeneity of the real world, and can have very significant 
  distributive implications:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Across economic sectors.</i> The carbon content of the steel, aluminium, 
    cement, basic chemical, and transport industries are, indeed, four to five 
    times higher per unit of value added than for the rest of industry. For unilateral 
    initiatives, carbon taxes drastically impact the competitiveness of these 
    sectors (with potential economic shocks at the regional level); even with 
    an internationally co-ordinated policy, their equity value will be lowered 
    compared with the rest of industry.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i> Across households income groups.</i> Carbon taxation increases the relative 
    prices of energy services such as heating, lighting, and transport. The resultant 
    impact on welfare is then more negative for low income levels and people living 
    in cold areas and in low density areas. It is also higher for high income 
    groups and more beneficial for medium income groups in case of swap with other 
    taxation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Economic analysis can define the compensation necessary to offset these negative 
  distributional effects but, in the real world, winners cannot (or are not willing 
  to) compensate losers. This is especially relevant when the losers suffer heavy 
  impacts and the winners enjoy only marginal gains, which leads to the so-called 
  political mobilization bias (Olson, 1965; Keohane and Nye, 1998) when the losers 
  are more ready to organize a lobbying and incur mobilization costs than the 
  winners (Williamson, 1996). Under such circumstances, policies yielding the 
  largest aggregate net benefits may prove very difficult to enforce. Economic 
  models provide no answer to this issue, but can try to frame the debate by providing 
  the stakeholders with appropriate information. This is the objective of <a href="330.htm">Sections 
  8.2.2.2</a> and <a href="332.htm">8.2.2.3.</a><br>
