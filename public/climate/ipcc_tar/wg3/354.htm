<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Policies adopted to mitigate global warming will have implications for specific 
  sectors, such as the coal industry, the oil and gas industry, electricity, manufacturing, 
  transportation and households. A sectoral assessment helps to put the costs 
  in perspective, to identify the potential losers, and the extent and location 
  of the losses, as well as to identify the sectors that may benefit. However, 
  it is worth noting that the available literature to make this assessment is 
  limited: there are few comprehensive studies of the sectoral effects of mitigation, 
  compared with those on the macro gross domestic product (GDP) effects, and they 
  tend to be for Annex B countries and regions.</p>
<p>There is a fundamental problem for mitigation policies. It is well established 
  that, compared to the situation for potential gainers, the potential sectoral 
  losers are easier to identify, and their losses are likely to be more immediate, 
  more concentrated, and more certain. The potential sectoral gainers (apart from 
  the renewables sector and perhaps the natural gas sector) can only expect a 
  small, diffused, and rather uncertain gain, spread over a long period. Indeed 
  many of those who may gain do not exist, being future generations and industries 
  yet to develop.</p>
<p>It is also well established that the overall effects on GDP of mitigation policies 
  and measures, whether positive or negative, conceal large differences between 
  sectors. In general, the energy intensity and the carbon intensity of the economies 
  will decline. The coal and perhaps the oil industries are expected to lose substantial 
  proportions of output relative to those in the reference scenarios, but other 
  sectors may increase their outputs yet by much smaller proportions. Energy-intensive 
  sectors, such as heavy chemicals, iron and steel, and mineral products, will 
  face higher costs, accelerated technical or organizational change, or loss of 
  output (again relative to the reference scenario) depending on their energy 
  use and the policies adopted for mitigation. Other industries, including renewables 
  and services, can be expected to benefit in the long term from the availability 
  of financial and other resources that would otherwise have been taken up in 
  fossil fuel production. They may also benefit from reductions in tax burdens, 
  if taxes are used for mitigation, and the revenues recycled as reductions in 
  employer or corporate or other taxes.</p>
<p>Within this broad picture, certain sectors will be substantially affected by 
  mitigation. The coal industry, producing the most carbon-intensive of products, 
  faces almost inevitable decline in the long term relative to the baseline projection. 
  However, technologies still under development, such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) 
  sequestration from coal-burning plants and in-situ gasification, could play 
  a future role in maintaining the output of coal whilst reducing CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and other emissions. The oil industry also faces a potential relative decline, 
  although this may be moderated by (1) lack of substitutes for oil in transportation 
  and (2) substitution away from solid fuels towards liquid fuels in electricity 
  generation. Modelling studies suggest that mitigation policies may have the 
  least impact on oil, the most impact on coal, with the impact on gas somewhere 
  between; these findings are established but incomplete. The high variation across 
  studies for the effects of mitigation on gas demand is associated with the importance 
  of its availability in different locations, its specific demand patterns, and 
  the potential for gas to replace coal in power generation.</p>
<p>Particularly large effects on the coal sector are expected from policies such 
  as the removal of fossil fuel subsidies or the restructuring of energy taxes 
  so as to tax the carbon content rather than the energy content of fuels. It 
  is a well-established finding that removal of the subsidies would result in 
  substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as stimulating 
  economic growth. However, the effects in specific countries depend heavily on 
  the type of subsidy removed and the commercial viability of alternative energy 
  sources, including imported coal; and there may be adverse distributional effects.</p>
<p> There is a wide range of estimates for the impact of implementation of the 
  Kyoto Protocol on the oil market using global models and stylized policies. 
  All studies show net growth in both oil production and revenue to at least 2020 
  with or without mitigation. They show that implementation leads to a fall in 
  oil-exporting countries&#146; revenues, GDP, income or welfare, but significantly 
  less impact on the real price of oil than has resulted from market fluctuations 
  over the past 30 years. Of the studies surveyed, the largest fall in the Organization 
  of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) revenues is a 25% reduction in 2010 
  below the baseline projection, assuming no permit trading and implying a 17% 
  fall in oil prices; the reduction in OPEC revenues becomes just over 7% with 
  Annex B trading.</p>
<p>However, the studies typically do not consider some or all of the following 
  factors that could lessen the impact on oil production and trade. They usually 
  do not include policies and measures for non-CO2 GHGs or non-energy sources 
  of GHGs, offsets from sinks, and actions under the Kyoto Protocol related to 
  funding, insurance, and the transfer of technology. In addition, the studies 
  typically do not include other policies and effects that can reduce the total 
  cost of mitigation, such as the use of tax revenues to reduce tax burdens, ancillary 
  environmental benefits of reductions in fossil fuel use, and induced technical 
  change from mitigation policies. As a result, the studies may tend to overstate 
  the overall costs of achieving Kyoto targets.</p>
<p>The very likely direct costs for fossil fuel consumption are accompanied by 
  very likely environmental and public health benefits associated with a reduction 
  in the extraction and burning of the fuels. These benefits come from a reduction 
  in the damages caused by these activities, especially the reduction in the emissions 
  of pollutants that are associated with combustion, such as sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), 
  nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and other chemicals, 
  and particulate matter. This will improve local and regional air and water quality, 
  and thereby lessen damage to human, animal and plant health and the ecosystem. 
  If all the pollutants associated with GHG emissions are removed by new technologies 
  or end-of-pipe abatement (for example, flue gas desulphurization on a power 
  station combined with removal of all other non-GHG pollutants), then this ancillary 
  benefit will no longer exist. But removal of all pollutants is limited at present 
  and it is expensive, especially for small-scale emissions from dwellings and 
  cars.</p>
<p>Industries concerned directly with mitigation are likely to benefit from action. 
  These include renewable electricity, producers of mitigation equipment (incorporating 
  energy- and carbon-saving technologies), agriculture and forestry producing 
  energy crops, research services producing energy and carbon-saving research 
  and development (R&amp;D). The extent and nature of the benefits will vary with 
  the policies followed. Some mitigation policies can lead to overall economic 
  benefits, implying that the gains from many sectors will outweigh the losses 
  for coal and other fossil fuels, and energy-intensive industries. In contrast, 
  other less well-designed policies can lead to overall losses.</p>
<p>These results come from different approaches and models. A proper interpretation 
  of the results requires an understanding of the methods adopted and the underlying 
  assumptions of the models and studies. Large differences in results can arise 
  from the use of different reference scenarios or baselines. The characteristics 
  of the baseline can also markedly affect the quantitative results of modelling 
  mitigation policy. For example, if air quality is assumed to be satisfactory 
  in the baseline, then the potential for air-quality ancillary benefits in any 
  GHG mitigation scenario is ruled out by assumption. Even with similar or the 
  same baseline assumptions, the studies yield different results. As regards the 
  costs of mitigation, these differences appear to be largely a result of different 
  approaches and assumptions, with the most important being the type of model 
  adopted. Bottom-up engineering models assuming new technological opportunities 
  tend to show benefits from mitigation. Top-down, general equilibrium models 
  appear to show lower costs than top-down, time-series econometric models. The 
  main assumptions leading to lower costs in the models are that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>new flexible instruments, such as emission trading and joint implementation, 
    are adopted;</li>
  <li>evenues from taxes or permit sales are returned to the economy by reducing 
    burdensome taxes; and </li>
  <li>anacillary benefits, especially from reduced air pollution, are included 
    in the results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, long-term technological progress and diffusion are largely given in 
  the top-down models; different assumptions or a more integrated, dynamic treatment 
  could have major effects on the results.</p>
<p>It is worth placing the task faced by mitigation policy in an historical perspective. 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have tended to grow more slowly than GDP in a number 
  of countries over the last 40 years. The reasons for such trends vary but include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a shift away from coal and oil and towards nuclear and gas as the source 
    of energy;</li>
  <li>improvements in energy efficiency by industry and households; and</li>
  <li>service and information-based economic activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>These trends will be encouraged and strengthened by mitigation policies. </p>
