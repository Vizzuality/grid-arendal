<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>Nevertheless, much work needs to be done and decisions undertaken in this area 
  soon. Assessments indicate the poor quality of data. National data of the member 
  states for major GHGs are not comparable, accurate, or reliable outside the 
  energy sector (Lanchbery, 1997): emission figures given in national inventories 
  are often of poor quality (in many subsectors, no estimates are made at all 
  by some countries). This is not surprising given the rapid development of the 
  climate issue and the requirement for reliable inventories. However, it impedes 
  significantly the simplest reviews of implementation.</p>
<p>At the moment the reporting process may not be transparent enough. Further 
  decisions could be undertaken, both at national and international levels, to 
  improve its effectiveness. That is, to improve and develop further the compilation 
  methodologies, increase the transparency of the compilation process and its 
  reliability, and more work is needed that is specifically directed towards obtaining 
  information for inventories, rather than purely for scientific purposes. It 
  is crucial that inventories of GHGs are accurate, reliable, and comprehensive. 
  Otherwise, it is not possible to determine the state of the emissions, where 
  they originate, and how they are changing.</p>
<p>As the climate change regime develops after Kyoto, the issues of emissions 
  measurement and verification, including the release and absorption of carbon 
  from changes in land use, rice cultivation, and forest management, will become 
  even more important. And it represents one of the toughest challenges for the 
  scientific community. By adding three additional gases and sinks, the Kyoto 
  Protocol fulfils its ambition to be more complete, but at the same time it makes 
  compliance more difficult, and it complicates monitoring and verification (Corfee-Morlot 
  and Schwengels, 1994). In particular, it raises the need for further modelling, 
  a comprehensive new analysis, and better inventories.</p>
<p>Targets agreed by Kyoto are challenging. However, to implement the commitments 
  and to meet the targets it is necessary to reach a common understanding of what 
  they mean. Forecasts from different sources are often not comparable. For example, 
  data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) are different from national 
  figures. Even different ministries in the same country, let alone in other countries, 
  use different assumptions, which significantly hampers the comparability of 
  data. Assumptions on burden sharing and cost-effectiveness analysis become more 
  difficult or even arbitrary. Thus, one of the first decisions regarding the 
  steps of Kyoto Protocol implementation should be to make the data and assumptions 
  to be used more consistent.</p>
<p>Verification and monitoring mechanisms are of particular importance to implement 
  flexible mechanisms. Without a clear definition, measurement, and inventory 
  of emissions and emissions reduction, binding targets cannot be achieved and 
  flexible mechanisms cannot be realized, as is stressed in various parts of the 
  Kyoto Protocol. Baseline calculations, monitoring, and verification play a crucial 
  role in measuring emissions reductions that result from JI and CDM projects, 
  and thereby ensure that these projects are based on real environment improvements 
  (Jepma and Munasinghe, 1998). Decisions and agreement among parties is urgently 
  needed on firm rules based on accepted methodologies (e.g., benchmarking). The 
  same applies to emissions trading: rules that govern emissions-trading markets 
  must be simple and transparent. Particularly important are rules on the total 
  number of permits available in the market, the permit tenure (their duration), 
  eligibility criteria, the method of initial permit allocation, and the monitoring 
  mechanism.</p>
<p>How to make the verification and enforcement system more effective? Several 
  suggestions in this respect refer to environmental agreements in general (Green, 
  1993). Different coercive measures, such as trade sanctions and other penalties, 
  may be needed in cases of severe violations. To date, practice shows that sanctions 
  have been used rarely, but when applied they have often been effective (Victor, 
  1995). A looming challenge is to determine when and how sanctions can be made 
  compatible with international trade rules. Potential conflicts between the sanctions 
  that have sometimes been vital to international environmental co-operation and 
  the free-trade rules that discourage sanctions have not been tested or settled. 
  There are also suggestions to use, for reluctant countries, various compensations 
  for the costs of implementing the treaties (compensation for national reporting 
  testifies to this approach). Other suggestions include bilateral funding programmes. 
  Several funding programmes have been undertaken to support the compilation and 
  reporting of national inventories by the developing countries and countries 
  with economies in transition.</p>
<p>Regimes that elicit the most co-operation have at their disposal more powerful 
  carrots and sticks with which to enforce international obligations. Such tools 
  are increasingly being used, and they work&#151;especially when the sanction 
  is to withdraw financial assistance. The threat of cutting off finance has brought 
  swift compliance. The combination of soft management backed by strict enforcement 
  when necessary has been effective. The most flagrant violations have been deterred 
  and reversed only when strong incentives, including threats of trade sanctions, 
  have been applied (Chayes and Chayes, 1995).</p>
<p>Such market-based mechanisms as GHG emissions trading also may be regarded 
  as a tool to make the UNFCCC implementation easier and less costly for many 
  developed countries. The Kyoto Protocol envisions creating a system of internationally 
  tradable emissions rights that can be used to lower the cost of cutting emissions 
  of GHGs. The international use of market-based incentives is virgin territory. 
  There are no direct historical precedents, and there is much to be learned about 
  the institutions that will be needed to enable the successful international 
  use of market-based systems.</p>
