<h2>9.4 Why Studies Differ <br>
</h2>
<p>This section consolidates the explanations for the different findings in both 
  the macro studies reviewed in <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> and the sectoral 
  studies in this chapter. It extends and complements the methodological discussion 
  in the SAR (Hourcade <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1996, pp. 282-92), particularly in the role of 
  assumptions leading to differing results.</p>
<p>In assessing the economy-wide effects of mitigation, considerable use has been 
  made of top-down models (macroeconomic, general equilibrium, and energy-engineering), 
  while specific sectoral studies use both top-down and engineering-economic bottom-up 
  models. Critical differences in the results come from the type of model used, 
  and its basic assumptions. Repetto and Austin (1997), in a meta-analysis of 
  model results on the costs of mitigation for the USA, show that 80% of predicted 
  impacts come from choice of assumptions. They find that four assumptions are 
  critical in leading to lower costs of mitigation. These are that: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the economy responds efficiently to policy changes at least in the long 
    run;</li>
  <li>international joint implementation is achieved;</li>
  <li>revenues from taxes or permit sales are returned to the economy through 
    reducing burdensome taxes; and</li>
  <li>any co-benefits from reduced air pollution are fully included.</li>
</ul>
<p>They conclude that under reasonable assumptions, the predicted economic impacts 
  from the models for the USA in stabilizing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at 1990 
  levels through to 2020 would be neutral or even favourable.<br>
</p>
<p> Most early studies are focused on the costs, rather than on the benefits of 
  mitigation<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#11","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>11</sup></small></a>. 
  More recently, top-down modellers have studied the impact of using the revenues 
  collected from carbon taxes (or from auctions of carbon permits) to correct 
  economic distortions in some sectors of the economy (typically to reduce taxes 
  on labour, taxes on incomes and profits, or taxes on investment). </p>
<h3><a name="941"></a>9.4.1 The Influence of Methods</h3>
<h4><a name="9411"></a>9.4.1.1 Top-down and Bottom-up Modelling</h4>
<p>The adoption of top-down or bottom-up methods makes a significant difference 
  to the results of mitigation studies (see <a href="322.htm#821">8.2.1</a> and 
  <a href="326.htm">8.2.2</a> for discussion and results). In top-down studies 
  the behaviours of the economy, the energy system, and their constituent sectors 
  are analyzed using aggregate data. In bottom-up studies, specific actions and 
  technologies are modelled at the level of the energy-using, GHG-emitting equipment, 
  such as power-generating stations or vehicle engines, and policy outcomes are 
  added up to find overall results. The top-down approach leads easily to a consideration 
  of the effects of mitigation on different broad sectors of the economy (not 
  just the energy and capital goods sectors), so that the literature on these 
  effects tends to be dominated by this approach. </p>
<p><a href="#tab910">Table 9.10</a> compares the methodologies. They have a fundamentally 
  different treatment of capital equipment and markets. Top-down studies have 
  tended to suggest that mitigation policies have economic costs because markets 
  are assumed to operate efficiently and any policy that impairs this efficiency 
  will be costly. Bottom-up studies tend to suggest that mitigation can yield 
  financial and economic benefits, depending on the adoption of best-available 
  technologies and the development of new technologies. Some hybrid models include 
  both approaches (see Laroui and van Leeuwen, 1995, for an example).<br>

<h4><a name="9412"></a>9.4.1.2 General Equilibrium and Time-series Econometric 
  Modelling<br>
</h4>
<p>There are two main types of macroeconomic models used for medium- and long-term 
  economic projections<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#12","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>12</sup></small></a>: resource allocation models (i.e. CGE) and time-series 
  econometric models. Their main differences being the assumptions made about 
  the real measured economy, aggregation, dynamics, equilibrium, empirical basis, 
  and time horizons, among others.<br>
</p>
<p>The main characteristic of CGE models is that they have an explicit specification 
  of the behaviour of all relevant economic agents in the economy. In the mitigation 
  applications they have usually adopted assumptions of optimizing rationality, 
  free market pricing, constant returns to scale, many firms and suppliers of 
  factors, and perfect competition in order to provide a market-clearing equilibrium 
  in all markets. Econometric models have relied more on time-series data methods 
  to estimate their parameters rather than consensus estimates drawn from the 
  literature. Results from these models are explained not only by their assumptions 
  but also by the quality and coverage of their data. It is usually argued that 
  CGE models are more suitable for describing long-run steady-state behaviour, 
  while econometric models are more suitable for forecasting the short-run. However, 
  the models have increasingly incorporated long-run theory and formal econometric 
  methods, and several now include a mix of characteristics, from both resource 
  allocation and econometric models; see Jorgenson and Wilcoxen (1993), McKibbin 
  and Wilcoxen (1993, 1995), Barker and Gardiner (1996), Barker (1998b) and McKibbin 
  <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1999).<br>
