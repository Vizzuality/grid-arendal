<h3><a name="133"></a>1.3.3 How Has Global Climate Policy Treated Equity? </h3>
<p>Indeed, some elements of the equity agenda&#150;primarily at the international 
  level&#150;have been incorporated into the emerging global climate policy regime. 
  In particular: </p>
<ul>
  <li>initial mitigation efforts have been concentrated in Annex I countries, 
    resulting in a search for the most cost-effective solutions as detailed in 
    <a href="051.htm">Section 1.2</a>;</li>
  <li>currently, non-Annex I countries are exempt from specific mitigation obligations;<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#14","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>14</sup></small></a> 
  </li>
  <li>there are agreements to provide financial resources to non-Annex I countries 
    to cover the full cost of preliminary climate obligations (e.g., monitoring, 
    reporting, and planning), and the incremental cost of voluntary mitigation 
    actions;</li>
  <li>there are agreements and some programs to provide technical assistance and 
    training to identify potential win&#150;win opportunities;</li>
  <li>various voluntary mechanisms are being designed to induce early mitigation 
    action in non-Annex I countries, most notably including the CDM of the Kyoto 
    Protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the details of the CDM are still to be worked out, in broad terms it 
  allows entities in Annex I countries to fulfil their mitigation obligations 
  through co-operative investment in non-Annex I countries, presumably at a lower 
  cost. It has been hailed by some analysts as an ingenious device to reconcile 
  the goals of GHG abatement and sustainable development (see Goldemberg, 1998b; 
  Haites and Aslam, 2000). On the other hand, it has also generated a degree of 
  criticism. Critics fear that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CDM will channel investment into projects of marginal social utility (Agarwal 
    and Narain, 1999);</li>
  <li>gains will not be shared fairly (Parikh <i>et al</i>., 1991, 1997a; Parikh, 1994, 
    1995);</li>
  <li>technology transfer will not be satisfactory (Parikh, 2000);</li>
  <li>poorer countries (especially African countries) and vulnerable groups will 
    be excluded (Sokona <i>et al</i>., 1998, 1999; Goldemberg, 1998b); </li>
  <li>only resources for cheap mitigation options will be attracted (the so-called 
    &#147;low-hanging fruit&#148;), leaving developing countries to undertake 
    the more expensive options themselves (Agarwal <i>et al</i>., 1999);<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#15","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>15</sup></small></a> 
  </li>
  <li>CDM will lead to an effective relaxation of the emission caps (Begg <i>et al</i>., 
    2000; Parkinson <i>et al</i>., 1999), and </li>
  <li>paradoxically, it may compromise the capacity of developing countries to 
    pursue sustainable development (Banuri and Gupta, 2000). </li>
</ul>
Going beyond the current options, such as CDM, and to a longer 
time horizon raises the need to integrate mitigation goals within the broader 
(sustainable) development agendas of developing countries (Najam, 2000). An emerging 
literature has begun to explore this redefined problem (see Munasinghe, 2000). 
Some issues that are relevant to this discussion include:
<ul>
  <li>Scale. The scale of the mitigation challenge in non-Annex I countries is 
    projected to be much broader in the long term than the short term. Instead 
    of an exclusive reliance on financial and technological assistance, which 
    ordinarily indicates increases in assistance levels significantly above historical 
    trends, there is a need to invest in indigenous capacity to undertake mitigation 
    without compromising the development agenda. </li>
  <li>Timing. To sustain the interest of both developed and developing countries 
    in co-operative solutions, the goal must be to lower the cost of mitigation 
    over time rather than to concentrate simply on exhausting the cheap mitigation 
    options (the so-called &#147;low-hanging fruit&#148;). </li>
  <li>Relevance to economic growth and sustainable development. Recent studies 
    of the impact of foreign resource inflows demonstrate that these flows alone 
    do not suffice to promote economic growth or sustainable development without 
    appropriate policy and institutional environments (World Bank, 1998). It is 
    not clear whether financial resources alone will lead to climate mitigation 
    and economic growth.</li>
  <li> Equity and trust. Despite consistent and repeated references to equity 
    in climate agreements, sceptics remain wary that equity will eventually be 
    subverted in some way and involuntary obligations imposed on non-Annex I countries 
    (without financial compenzation) to force them to bear a disproportionate 
    burden of mitigation (Agarwal and Narain, 1991a; Hyder, 1992; Parikh, 1992; 
    Dasgupta, 1994; Parikh, 1995; Parikh and Parikh, 1998; Agarwal <i>et al</i>., 1999).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#16","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>16</sup></small></a>  
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Some scholars propose remedies to reconcile these longer-term concerns with 
  the more immediate goals of the existing agenda. The simplest is a proposal 
  to restrict all co-operative measures&#150;and thus all early and voluntary 
  action in non-Annex I countries&#150;to &#147;non-carbon&#148; projects (Agarwal 
  and Narain, 1999). While this would exclude some legitimate mitigation options 
  from the purview, it could channel research and entrepreneurial resources into 
  a new market, bring down unit costs, create and strengthen technical and managerial 
  capacities, and thus enable both developed and developing countries to engineer 
  a transition to a carbon-free future. Renewable energy projects have been implemented 
  at smaller scales, which make them appropriate for poor rural communities. Other 
  proposals similarly address the potential co-benefits of the protection of primary 
  forests (see Kremen <i>et al</i>., 2000).</p>
