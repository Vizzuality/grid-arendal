<h3>2.2.2 Mitigation and Stabilization Scenarios</h3>
<p>Mitigation scenarios are usually defined as a description and a quantified 
  projection of how GHG emissions can be reduced with respect to some baseline 
  scenario. They contain new emission profiles as well as costs associated with 
  the emission reduction. Stabilization scenarios are mitigation scenarios that 
  aim at a pre-specified GHG reduction target. Usually the target is the concentration 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> or the CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent concentration of a &#147;basket&#148; 
  of gases by 2100 or at some later date when atmospheric stabilization is actually 
  reached.</p>
<p>There are two common difficulties associated with the formulation and quantification 
  of mitigation scenarios. First, in certain cases there is not a clear-cut distinction 
  between intervention and non-intervention scenarios, that is, scenarios with 
  or without explicit climate policy. This is discussed in detail in <a href="#box21">Box 
  2.1</a>. The second important problem regarding mitigation scenarios has to 
  do with the difference between top-down and bottom-up models. Whereas the latter 
  focus on engineering trends and technology costs, the former view resource development 
  from a macroeconomic price-mediated perspective. Although, as discussed in the 
  SAR (IPCC, 1995), the differences between these approaches are continiously 
  narrowing as each incorporates elements of the other, there is still quite a 
  difference in their formulation of emission reduction strategies. This suggests 
  the importance of including multiple methodological approaches in scenario analysis.</p>

      <p><b>Box 2.1. Differentiating Between Climate Policy and No-climate-policy 
        Scenarios</b></p>
      <p>Recent discussions among IPCC experts and reactions from reviewers of 
        this report and the SRES report revealed the need to clarify differences 
        between various types of GHG emission scenarios, in particular, between 
        climate policy scenarios (CP scenarios) and scenarios without climate 
        policies (NCP scenarios) but with low emissions. </p>
      <p>CP scenarios (also known as climate intervention or climate mitigation 
        scenarios) are defined in this report as those that: (1) include explicit 
        policies and/or measures, the primary<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>3</sup></small></a> 
        goal of which is to reduce GHG emissions (e.g., carbon tax) and/or (2) 
        mention no climate policies and/or measures, but assume temporal changes 
        in GHG emission sources or drivers required to achieve particular climate 
        targets (e.g., GHG emission levels, GHG concentration levels, temperature 
        increase or sea level rise limits).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#4","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>4</sup></small></a></p>
      <p>CP scenarios are often, but not always, constructed with reference to 
        a corresponding reference or baseline scenario that is similar to the 
        CP scenario in every respect except the inclusion of climate mitigation 
        measures and/or policies. In fact, climate policy analysis often starts 
        with the construction of such a reference scenario, to which is added 
        climate policy to create the CP scenario.</p>
      <p>Another type of CP scenario is not originally built around such &#147;no-policy&#148; 
        baselines. Developers of such scenarios envision future &#147;worlds&#148; 
        that are internally consistent with desirable climate targets (e.g., a 
        global temperature increase of no more than 1&deg;C by 2100), and then 
        work &#147;backwards&#148; to develop feasible emission trajectories and 
        emission driver combinations leading to these targets. Such scenarios, 
        also referred to as &#147;safe landing&#148; or &#147;tolerable windows&#148; 
        scenarios, imply the necessary development and implementation of climate 
        policies, intended to achieve these targets in the most efficient way.</p>
      <p>The general definition of CP scenarios provided here enables one to effectively 
        discriminate between CP scenarios and other scenarios with low emissions 
        (e.g., IS92c, SRES-B1). Unlike the former, NCP scenarios have low emissions 
        but do not assume any explicit emission abatement measures or policies, 
        nor are they designed specifically to achieve certain climate targets. 
        NCP scenarios by themselves may explore a wide variety of alternative 
        development paths, including &#147;green&#148; or &#147;dematerialization&#148; 
        futures.</p>
      <p>Confusion can arise when the inclusion of &#147;non-climate-related&#148; 
        policies in a NCP scenario has the effect of significantly reducing GHG 
        emissions. For example, energy efficiency or land use policies that reduce 
        GHG emissions may be adopted for reasons that are not related to climate 
        policies and may therefore be included in a NCP scenario. Such a NCP scenario 
        may have GHG emissions that are lower than some CP scenarios. </p>
      <p>The root cause of this potential confusion is that, in practice, many 
        policies can both reduce GHG emissions and achieve other goals. Whether 
        such policies are assumed to be adopted for climate or non-climate policy 
        related reasons in any given scenario is determined by the scenario developer 
        based on the underlying scenario narrative. While this is a problem in 
        terms of making a clear distinction between CP and NCP scenarios, it is 
        at the same time an opportunity. Because many decisions are not made for 
        reasons of climate change alone, measures implemented for reasons other 
        than climate change can have a large impact on GHG emissions, opening 
        up many new possibilities for mitigation. Chapters 7, 8, and 9 discuss 
        ancillary benefits of climate mitigation and the co-benefits of policies 
        integrating climate mitigation objectives with other goals.<br>

<h3>2.2.3 Scenarios and &#147;Development, Equity, and Sustainability (DES)&#148;</h3>
<p>The climate issue is embedded in the larger question of how combined social, 
  economic, and environmental subsystems interact and shape one another over many 
  decades. There are multiple links. Economic development depends on maintenance 
  of ecosystem resilience; poverty can be both a result and a cause of environmental 
  degradation; material-intensive lifestyles conflict with environmental and equity 
  values; and extreme socio-economic inequality within societies and between nations 
  undermines the social cohesion required for effective policy responses. </p>
<p>It is clear that climate policy, and the impacts of climate change, will have 
  significant implications for sustainable development at both the global and 
  sub-global levels. In addition, policy and behavioural responses to sustainable 
  development issues may affect both our ability to develop and successfully implement 
  climate policies, and our ability to respond effectively to climate change. 
  In this way, climate policy response will affect the ability of countries to 
  achieve sustainable development goals, while the pursuit of those goals will 
  in turn affect the opportunities for, and success of, climate policy responses. 
</p>
<p>In this report and its Working Group II companion report, climate change impacts, 
  mitigation, and adaptation strategies are discussed in the broader context of 
  DES (see Munasinghe, 1999). </p>
<p>The issues raised by a consideration of DES are of particular relevance to 
  the scenarios discussed in this chapter. Because they are necessarily based 
  upon assumptions about the socio-economic conditions that give rise to emissions 
  profiles, mitigation and stabilization scenarios implicitly or explicitly contain 
  information about DES. In principle, each stabilization or mitigation scenario 
  describes a particular future world, with particular economic, social, and environmental 
  characteristics. Given the strong interactions between development, environment, 
  and equity as aspects of a unified socio-ecological system and the interplay 
  between climate policies and DES policies, emissions scenarios are viewed in 
  this report as an aspect of broad sustainable development scenarios.</p>
<p>The allocation of emissions in a scenario is coupled closely to an important 
  policy question in climate negotiations: the fair distribution of future emission 
  rights among nations, or &#147;burden sharing&#148;. For example, an egalitarian 
  formulation of the rights of developing countries to future &#147;climate space&#148; 
  is often expressed in terms of equal per capita emissions allocations. Alternative 
  assumptions on burden sharing have important implications for equity, sustainable 
  development, and the economics of emissions abatement. However, it is noteworthy 
  that this critical conditioning variable is usually not explicitly treated in 
  mitigation scenarios in the literature (see <a href="073.htm#23">section 2.3</a>). 
  Indeed, documentation of scenarios generally does not address the implications 
  of the scenarios for equity and burden sharing. In rare cases, mitigation scenarios 
  have been developed which explicitly impose the simultaneous co-constraints 
  of climate and equity goals (e.g., Raskin <i>et al.</i>, 1998). </p>
<p>In this and other ways scenario analysis could become an important way of linking 
  DES issues to climate policy considerations. However, as discussed in more detail 
  in <a href="077.htm#24">section 2.4</a>, many quantitative mitigation and stabilization 
  scenarios have not been designed with this purpose in mind. As a result, it 
  is not always easy to draw out the DES implications of particular stabilization 
  and mitigation scenarios.</p>
<p>Although this chapter focuses on mitigation and stabilization scenarios, it 
  is important to note that DES issues are also implicit in the base case or reference 
  scenarios that underlie mitigation and stabilization scenarios. Since the difference 
  between reference case scenarios and stabilization and mitigation scenarios 
  is simply the addition of deliberate climate policy, it can be the case that 
  the DES differences among different reference case scenarios are greater than 
  between any one such scenario and its stabilization or mitigation version. This 
  is of particular relevance in the discussion below in <a href="082.htm#252">section 
  2.5.2</a> of scenarios based on the baselines produced in the IPCC&#146;s SRES 
  (Nakicenovic <i>et al.</i>, 2000).</p>
