<h3>5.4.1 Buildings</h3>
<p>The buildings (residential and commercial) sector accounted for about a third 
  of carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion in 1995. Its share of the total 
  emissions has increased faster than in other sectors (Price <i>et al</i>., 1998). 
  About half the emissions in this sector are from fuel use in the commercial 
  sector, and the other half from the residential sector. Energy use in the sector 
  is for cooking, space conditioning, water heating, and lighting and appliances. 
  Aside from the use of modern energy, biomass use constitutes a significant portion 
  of the energy supply, particularly in the developing world. The bulk of households 
  in rural areas use biomass for cooking, and water and space heating. Much of 
  the biomass (particularly for firewood, and charcoal combustion and charcoal 
  production processes) in developing countries is used in an unsustainable fashion 
  and results in additions to anthropogenic emissions (CEEEZ, 1998).</p>
<p>Barriers to the full realization of the opportunities for improving energy 
  efficiency in this sector have been extensively studied. The key barriers are 
  traditional customs, lack of skills, social barriers, misplaced incentives, 
  lack of financing, market structure, administratively set prices, and imperfect 
  information (Golove and Eto, 1996; Brown, 1997). </p>
<p><i>Traditional Customs </i><br>
  Lack of appreciation in the design and manufacture of energy-using devices can 
  inhibit their penetration. In the case of improved biomass stoves it has been 
  shown (ESD, 1995) that despite savings on household charcoal budgets, improved 
  stove commercialization still remains a problem, because of inconsistent design 
  and quality control in the manufacture of stoves. In some programmes (CEEEZ, 
  1998), field surveys showed that most users of improved cookstoves returned 
  to traditional stoves, owing to a preference for speed in cooking with traditional 
  stoves as compared to the former. </p>
<p><i>Lack of Skills </i><br>
  Insufficient skills in the manufacture of efficient appliances can slow or stop 
  their diffusion. For example, dissemination of improved stoves could not be 
  sustained (CEEEZ, 1998), because of various reasons, among them being increased 
  production time arising from the complexity of the stove design. As a result, 
  local producers switched to the production of familiar items, which were easy 
  for them to manufacture. </p>
<p><i>Behaviour and Style</i><b> </b><br>
  Despite the existence of demand-side management programmes, in most developed 
  countries, and the availability of more technologically efficient household 
  devices (such as air conditioners) in the market place, changes in behaviour 
  and style (associated with a desire to increase dwelling size) tended to increase 
  the demand for energy services (Wilhite <i>et al</i>., 1996). Energy use for 
  space heating increased in Norwegian homes from 1960 to 1990 thanks to a doubling 
  of dwelling area per capita (Hille, 1997) in spite of more stringent building 
  codes and the doubling of thermal efficiency. </p>
<p>Another example is space cooling in Japan, where air conditioners are technically 
  very efficient, but space cooling demand is still increasing dramatically, because 
  of changes in dwelling size, changing tastes, and modern building design which 
  does not support natural cooling (Wilhite <i>et al</i>., 1996). For most home 
  owners, the lowest first cost is more important than a higher energy efficiency 
  level when purchase decisions are made about an appliance or a home (Hassett 
  and Metcalf, 1995).<br>
  <br>
  <i>Misplaced Incentives </i><br>
  These result between landlords and tenants with respect to acquisition of energy-efficient 
  equipment for rental property. Where the tenant is responsible for the monthly 
  cost of fuel and/or electricity, the landlord is prone to provide the least-first-cost 
  equipment without regard to its monthly energy use. Fee structures for architects 
  and designers are based on capital cost of the building. Designing an energy 
  efficient heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system costs more, and 
  reduces the capital and operating costs of the building, both of which serve 
  as a disincentive to architects for the design of energy-efficient structures 
  (Lovins, 1992). Also, in the buildings sector compensation to architects and 
  engineers based directly or indirectly on a percentage of the costs of the building 
  provides perverse incentives.</p>
<p><i>Lack of Financing </i><br>
  This refers to the significant restrictions on capital availability for low-income 
  households and small commercial businesses. Home mortgages for instance do not 
  as a rule carry a lower interest rate for efficient homes, which have low annual 
  energy costs. In case of switching to modern cooking stoves (electric, kerosene, 
  or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for example) in rural areas of developing countries, 
  the barriers result from household income, accessibility to modern fuels, the 
  relative cost of traditional and modern fuels, and cooking habits (Soussan, 
  1987). For example, in view of both national and global benefits, use of low-cost 
  electric stoves has been noted as a viable substitute for improved biomass cookstoves, 
  as they can contribute effectively to preserve forests to enhance carbon sequestration 
  (CEEEZ, 1998). Despite this realization, there has been a low level of switching 
  from charcoal stoves to electric stoves. This is largely because of a lack of 
  finance, resulting from low monthly income of which 35% to 45% is spent on fuel 
  (CEEEZ, 1998). </p>
<p><i>Market Structure </i><br>
  This can imbue power to firms who may inhibit the introduction by competitors 
  of energy-efficient equipment such as compact fluorescent lighting (Haddad, 
  1994). The design, construction and maintenance of buildings is largely fragmented. 
  This is in part cause by the lack of integration and communication between sub-sectors, 
  and in part a reflection of the diverse and large number of suppliers. This 
  results in many instances of building design, insulation, and energy-using devices 
  that do not exhibit high levels of energy efficiency (OTA, 1992). One response 
  in Switzerland since 1978 has been to ensure that architects are fully integrated 
  into the selection and construction of energy using devices in buildings (Jefferson, 
  2000). </p>
<p><i>Administratively Set Prices </i><br>
  These distort investment and the choice of energy forms and end-use equipment. 
  Electricity has been historically subsidized to residential customers in India, 
  and serves as a disincentive to faster penetration of efficient lighting and 
  appliances (Alam <i>et al</i>., 1998). In contrast to subsidies in the electricity 
  industries of India, non-availability of subsidies in the commercial dissemination 
  of improved cookstoves in Kenya has lead to dramatic improvements in the marketing 
  and distribution of improved stoves as shown in <a href="#box54">Box 5.4</a>.

    <td class="box"><b>Box 5.4. Commercial Dissemination of Improved Cook- stoves 
      in Kenya </b> 
      <p>One of the most successful improved cookstoves in Africa is the Kenya 
        Ceramic Jiko (KCJ) (Karekezi, 1991). The KCJ was introduced in Kenya in 
        1982 and mainly targets urban populations who used charcoal.</p>
      <p>The KCJ is produced and marketed through the informal sector. One of 
        the key characteristics of this project was the ability to utilise existing 
        production and distribution system for the traditional stove to produce 
        and market the KCJ.</p>
      <p>The most important factor to the successful commercialization of the 
        KCJ is the conscious decision made by the project initiators not to provide 
        subsidies. Although stove prices were initially high, the ensuing competition 
        between producers reduced the price from as high as US$15.00 to a prices 
        of US$2.50 in 1989 (Karekezi, 1991). Purchases made by high income groups 
        in the earlier stove dissemination, however, effectively subsidized the 
        stove development process thus making it available for lower income groups 
        (Otiti, 1991).</p>

<p><i>Economic Pricing </i><br>
  Economic pricing in the electricity sector, particularly in developing countries 
  and countries in transition, has been hampered by a lack of adherence to economic 
  tariff setting (based on long-run marginal cost (LRMC)). Attempts to rigorously 
  follow this concept, however, have resulted in social problems. For example, 
  in Russia, a country in the process of transformation to a market economy, LRMC 
  has led to pensioners not being able to afford their electricity bills, requiring 
  subsidies amounting to 20%-35% of the budgets of local authorities (Gritsevich, 
  2000). </p>
<p><i>Imperfect Information </i><br>
  The lack of adequate and accurate information, and the limited ability of users 
  to absorb it adds to the cost of its provision to consumers. Since energy costs 
  are typically small on an individual basis, it is rational for consumers to 
  ignore them in the face of information gathering and transaction costs. For 
  instance, Sony was able to reduce the standby power loss in TVs from 7-8 watts 
  to about 0.6 watt, a saving of US$5 per year per TV. One reason for consumers 
  to not buy more efficient appliances, despite a label advertising this fact, 
  is that consumers are wary or mistrustful because of past experience with advertised 
  misinformation (Stern and Aronson, 1984). Kempton and Montgomery (1982) have 
  shown that residential consumers systematically underestimate energy savings, 
  because they lack the ability to use the information to calculate and compare 
  savings with investment. Furthermore, Kempton and Layne (1994) liken today&#146;s 
  energy bills to receiving a single monthly bill for all groceries purchased 
  with no identification of the cost of individual items. <br>
