<p><b><a name="1"></a>1</b> For references see Table 8.1.</p>
<p><b><a name="2"></a>2</b> However, although the direct cost of switching away 
  from coal may be relatively low, the indirect costs (including the political 
  cost) of disrupting the coal sector may be high.</p>
<p><b><a name="3"></a>3</b> Some exceptions occur. For instance, in Norway emissions 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> from oil and gas production have traditionally been charged 
  the maximum rate.</p>
<p><b><a name="4"></a>4</b> See Chapter 7 for a more formal definition of ancillary 
  and co-benefits and costs of GHG mitigation.</p>
<p><b><a name="5"></a>5</b> A number of possibly important side benefits are not 
  amenable as yet to either quantitative or economic analyses (e.g., ecosystem 
  damages, biodiversity loss).</p>
<p><b><a name="6"></a>6</b> In SAR, IPCC estimated that, for European countries 
  and the USA, benefits such as reduced air pollution could offset between 30% 
  and 100% of the abatement costs (IPCC, 1996, p. 218). These estimates were controversial 
  and not supported by a standardized methodology. After SAR, extensive debates 
  arose regarding suitable costing methods to quantify the relative economic impacts 
  of various policies in distinct regions, with as yet no consensus on the most 
  suitable methods to be employed (Grubb <i><i>et al</i>.,</i> 1999). However, a consensus 
  is now beginning to emerge on how to quantify some ancillary benefits. See OECD, 
  Proceedings from Workshop on the Ancillary Benefits and Costs of Climate Change 
  Mitigation (OECD, 2000).</p>
<p><b><a name="7"></a>7</b> The exchange rate is US$1 vs Renminbi yuan (RMB Y) 
  8.3.</p>
<p><b><a name="8"></a>8</b> For example, if they are implemented, the recent proposed 
  tightening of the US standards for ozone and particulates and associated improvements 
  over time imply that benefits from reductions in the criteria air pollutants 
  that result from climate policies will be smaller in the future than if carried 
  out now.</p>
<p><b><a name="9"></a>9</b> Some environmental effects exhibit thresholds or non-linearities 
  that imply benefits do not move directly with reductions in local and regional 
  pollutants. Acidification is an interesting example because damage may result 
  only after critical load thresholds are violated. On the other hand, recovery 
  may not occur with a reduction in conventional pollutants until some new threshold 
  is achieved or after a significant time lag.</p>
<p><b><a name="10"></a>10</b> The new US PM<sub>2.5</sub> standard and the tighter 
  ozone standard have been remanded to the EPA by the D.C. Court of Appeals and 
  aspects of the case are currently being heard by the US Supreme Court. Thus, 
  these standards are not yet in effect (November 2000). </p>
<p><b><a name="11"></a>11</b> Most of the concentration-response functions for 
  health effects of air pollution are based on relative risks models, which give 
  the percentage increase in the number of health effects due to a change in air 
  pollution concentration. This percentage change needs to be applied to the base 
  rate of the effects (i.e. the number of effects observed without change in air 
  pollution). For example, for the non-accidental mortality in the USA, this base 
  rate is about 800/100,000.</p>
<p><b><a name="12"></a>12</b> Where there is a lack of local information on willingness 
  to pay, one option is to use studies from developed countries and &#147;adjust&#148; 
  the estimates for local conditions. This procedure is called benefit transfer: 
  &#147;an application of monetary values from a particular valuation study to 
  an alternative or secondary policy-decision setting, often in another geographic 
  area than the one where the original study was performed&#148; (Navrud, 1994). 
  The problems of such transfers are discussed in greater detail in Davis <i>et al</i>. 
  (2000).</p>
<p><b><a name="13"></a>13</b> This is exemplified by two others studies of the 
  economic impacts of Kyoto conducted by the US Government. It is remarkable that 
  GDP losses span from virtually zero to 3.5% and are correlated with the level 
  of marginal abatement cost. The EIA assessment is the highest because it accounts 
  for near-term shocks, such as inflationary impacts of higher energy prices (requiring 
  higher interest rates, which dampen the investment), and for a 5-year delay 
  in the response of agents). The EIA estimates rise to 4.2% when the non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  gases and carbon sinks are excluded from the analysis.</p>
<p><b><a name="14"></a>14</b> Hot air: a few countries, notably those with economies 
  in transition, have assigned amount units that appear to be well in excess of 
  their anticipated emissions (as a result of economic downturn). This excess 
  is referred to as &#147;hot air&#148;.</p>
<p><b><a name="15"></a>15</b> To the extent that increased non-Annex I emissions 
  result from more emission-intensive production techniques and increased production 
  of emission-intensive goods for internal consumption, policies to control emission 
  leakage by curbing the imports of emission-intensive goods into Annex I regions 
  are likely to be counterproductive. Curbing imports may restrict substitution 
  options in Annex I economies, requiring further cuts in output and exports that 
  would stimulate greater non-Annex I emission-intensive production.</p>
<p><b><a name="16"></a>16</b> These include techniques such as decomposition analysis 
  (Huff and Hertel, 1996) and multiple simulations, in which some variables are 
  held constant to isolate their influence on the final results. Verikios and 
  Hanslow (1999) employed such a framework to asses the welfare impacts of international 
  capital mobility.</p>
<b><a name="17"></a>17</b> In the G-cubed model such a mechanism is superimposed 
on the structure of a long-term growth model. 
<p><b><a name="18"></a>18</b> It is evident from simulations with the GTEM model 
  (Brown <i><i>et al</i>.</i>, 1999) that somewhat different results may be obtained 
  if emission reductions involve a least-cost mix of the different GHGs identified 
  under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p><b><a name="19"></a>19</b> These calculations are based on version 3 of the 
  GTAP database after reconciliation with energy data, mainly from the International 
  Energy Agency.</p>
<p><b><a name="20"></a>20</b> Please note that only one scenario was available 
  for the GDP loss data for A1T-450, A1T-550, A1FI-450, A1FI-650, A2-450, and 
  B2-650.</p>
