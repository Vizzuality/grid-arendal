<h3>7.4.5 Estimating Future Costs and Sustainability Implications </h3>
<p>Mitigation policies that are large in scale can have significant long-term 
  implications on future climate change and thereby have implications for intergenerational 
  equity. The issue is to model future changes in ecological systems and economic 
  welfare associated with different levels of climate change caused by specific 
  mitigation efforts. </p>
<p>Climate change offers an imposing set of complications for the policymaker&#150;global 
  scope, wide regional variations, the potential for irreversible damages or costs, 
  multiple GHGs, a very long planning horizon, and long time lags between emissions 
  today and future impacts on ecosystem services. For the economist, to assess 
  how these distant climate-induced changes in ecosystem services might affect 
  the economic wellbeing of citizens in the far distant future is no less imposing. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The challenge rests in capturing accurately three general issues: (1) how climate 
  change might affect ecological systems; (2) how these altered ecosystems might 
  affect the demand for different market and non-market goods and services; and 
  (3) how this demand change affects the welfare of our descendants. The first 
  two issues can only be dealt with by broad scenario analyses that consider alternative 
  development patterns for ecological systems and the interactions with man-made 
  systems. The third issue can be addressed by applying assumptions about the 
  preferences of future generations, which, for example, can be assumed to reflect 
  the preferences of present generations. </p>
<p>Those who undertake studies of welfare losses brought about by climate change 
  often focus on an assessment of the potential welfare losses suffered by future 
  citizens through climate change. Typically, such an assessment is based on measuring 
  the demand curve for people alive today under today&#146;s climate given the 
  substitution possibilities implied by extant technologies and knowledge constraints 
  that define today&#146;s opportunity set. Essentially, these analysts ask, &#147;If 
  the climate of the future enveloped us today, what would be our welfare loss?&#148;</p>
<p> The question often not asked is this: &#147;Does the opportunity set of today&#146;s 
  citizens reflect, in any way, the opportunity faced by citizens in 2050 or 2100?&#148; 
  A welfare loss based on today&#146;s opportunity set may or may not be related 
  to the potential climate-related loss in wellbeing to the citizens of the far 
  distant future. Climate change triggers direct changes in the opportunity set 
  and relative prices, and indirect changes in the adaptation of technology and 
  supply. This is critical. More opportunities in the future will reduce the welfare 
  loss; fewer opportunities could inflate the loss. The opportunities will depend 
  on a complex mix of available substitutes, complementary recreational and non-recreational 
  activities, relative prices, transaction costs, and preferences. These substitutes 
  will be determined by the various different types of capital stock that contribute 
  to human wellbeing, including man-made capital, human capital, natural capital, 
  and social capital, as emphasized by the sustainability literature. For a more 
  elaborate discussion on these issues see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 1</a>.</p>
<p>It is difficult to account for the opportunity sets of citizens in the far 
  distant future and to predict the preferences of future generations, which adds 
  a significant uncertainty to estimates of future damages from climate change. 
  Climate change might affect household resources, human resource investment prices 
  and levels, endowments, preferences, labour market opportunities, and natural 
  environment, all of which influence our descendant&#146;s opportunity set&#150;the 
  basic materials needed for attainment in life. These risks indirectly modify 
  our heirs&#146; life chances by reducing and reallocating household resources 
  or by constraining their choices or both. Our descendants may shift resources 
  towards a sick child and away from recreation. Their children might have to 
  forego the life experience of fishing the same river as their ancestors. Faced 
  with these consequences, individuals today might be willing to pay to prevent 
  risks that restrict our heir&#146;s opportunities. But this is a different question.</p>
<p>When considering future generations&#146; opportunities the impacts of today&#146;s 
  climate change investments on future generations&#146; opportunities should 
  also be considered. Investments might, for example, enhance the capacity of 
  future generations to adapt to climate change, but at the same time they potentially 
  displace other investments that could create other opportunities for future 
  generations.</p>
<p>Two things are likely to be different in the future&#150;the climate and our 
  heirs&#146; opportunities. Accounting for one change and not the other will 
  not markedly advance our understanding of expected benefits. The question should 
  be &#147;How could these future effects be linked to existing models to value 
  non-market effects?&#148; For the most part, the valuation question is how to 
  account for changes, both good and bad, of future opportunities. Accounting 
  for these decisions probably requires a new model that focuses on the value 
  of maintaining or enhancing the future&#146;s opportunities so as to maximize 
  their life chances, whatever their preferences might be. </p>
