<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The technological and economic potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
  is large enough to hold annual global greenhouse gas emissions to levels close 
  to or even below those of 2000 by 2010 and even lower by 2020. Realization of 
  these reductions requires combined actions in all sectors of the economy including 
  adoption of energy-efficient technologies and practices, increased fuel switching 
  toward lower carbon fuels, continued growth in the use of efficient gas turbines 
  and combined heat and power systems, greater reliance on renewable energy sources, 
  reduced methane emissions through improved farm management practices and ruminant 
  methane reduction strategies, diversification of land use to provide sinks and 
  offsets, increased recovery of landfill methane for electricity production and 
  increased recycling, reduction in the release of industrial gases, more efficient 
  vehicles, physical sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub>, and improving end-use efficiency 
  while protecting the ozone layer. Countervailing socioeconomic and behavioural 
  trends that cause greenhouse gas emissions to increase also exist, including 
  increased size of dwelling units, increased sales of heavier and more powerful 
  vehicles, growing vehicle kilometers travelled, reduced incentives for efficient 
  use of energy or the purchase of energy efficiency technologies as a result 
  of low real retail energy prices, increased consumption of consumer goods, and 
  stimulated demand for energy-consuming products as a result of increased electrification.</p>

<p>A number of new technologies and practices have gained importance since the 
  Second Assessment Report (SAR). As a result, greater opportunities for energy 
  efficiency are available, often at lower cost than was expected. Annual growth 
  in global consumption of primary energy and related carbon dioxide emissions 
  dropped to 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively, between 1990 and 1998 after experiencing 
  much higher growth rates of 2.4% and 2.1% between 1971 and 1990. This decrease 
  in growth rate is because of the combined effects of improved energy efficiency 
  technologies, increased fuel switching and adoption of renewable energy sources, 
  and the dramatic decrease in emissions of countries with economies in transition 
  (EITs) as a result of economic changes (<a href="#fig31">Figures 3.1</a> and 
  <a href="#fig32">3.2</a>). </p>
<p>Sustained progress in the development and adoption of technologies and practices 
  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions requires continued efforts in the areas of 
  research and development, demonstration, dissemination, policies, and programmes. 
  There has been a reduction in both public and private resources devoted to research 
  and development to develop and implement new technologies that will reduce greenhouse 
  gas emissions. Despite the development of new, efficient technologies, current 
  rates of energy efficiency improvements alone will not be sufficient to significantly 
  reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the near term. In addition, policies or programmes 
  to increase energy efficiency and promote renewable energy technology are lacking 
  in many countries. </p>
<p>Technological innovation and change are influenced by the differing needs of 
  different economies and sectors. A large percentage of capital is invested in 
  a relatively small number of technologies that are responsible for a significant 
  share of the energy supply and consumption market (automobiles, electric power 
  generators, industrial processes, and building heating and cooling systems). 
  There is a tendency to optimize these few technologies and their related infrastructure 
  development, gaining them advantages and locking them into the economy. That 
  makes it more difficult for alternative, low-carbon technologies to compete. 
  For example, a particular technological configuration such as road-based automobiles 
  has become &#147;locked-in&#148; as the dominant transportation mode. In industrial 
  countries, technologies are developed as a result of corporate innovation or 
  government-supported R&amp;D, and in response to environmental regulations, 
  utility deregulation, energy tax policies, or other incentives. In many developing 
  countries, where electric power capacity and much end-use demand is growing 
  most rapidly, there is often greater emphasis on getting technology such as 
  electric power generation established in order to enhance economic development, 
  with less concern for environmental and other issues. Capital flows and differing 
  types of technology transfer may also determine technology choices. It is important 
  to recognize that often values other than energy efficiency or greenhouse gas 
  emissions are the dominant shapers of technological choice and innovation.</p>
<p>This chapter describes technologies and practices to reduce greenhouse gas 
  emissions in the end-use sectors of the economy as well as through changes in 
  energy supply. The end-use sectors addressed are buildings, transport, industry, 
  agriculture, and waste. Energy supply includes non-renewable resources, renewable 
  resources, and physical carbon dioxide sequestration. In addition, options for 
  reducing global warming contributions from substitutes for ozone depleting substances 
  are discussed in the <a href="142.htm">Appendix</a> to this chapter.</p>
<p>The buildings sector contributes about 31% of global energy-related carbon 
  dioxide emissions and these emissions grew at an average annual rate of almost 
  2.0% between 1971 and 1995. Growth in emissions varied significantly by region; 
  between 1990 and 1995 the largest annual increases were experienced in developing 
  countries (around 5.0% per year), moderate growth was seen in developed countries 
  (around 1.0% per year), and emissions declined in the EITs (&#150;3.0% per year). 
  The growth in emissions in the developing and developed countries is largely 
  caused by the increased amenity that consumers demand &#150; in terms of increased 
  purchase and use of appliances, larger dwellings, and the modernization and 
  expansion of the commercial sector &#150; as economies grow. Technology has 
  continued on an evolutionary trajectory with incremental gains during the past 
  decade in windows, lighting, insulation, space heating, refrigeration, air conditioning, 
  building controls, passive solar design, and infiltration reduction. Although 
  CFCs have been eliminated in developed countries as working fluids in heat pumps, 
  air conditioners, and refrigerators, and as foam blowing agents for insulation, 
  research and development (R&amp;D) has been able to continue to improve energy 
  efficiency of refrigerators and cooling and heating systems. Integrated building 
  design has demonstrated very large reductions in energy use and greenhouse gas 
  emissions. Expanded R&amp;D is needed to assure continued technology improvement, 
  but implementation policies remain the major hurdle to their rapid introduction.</p>
<p>The transport sector contributes 22% of carbon dioxide emissions; globally, 
  emissions from this sector are growing at a rate of approximately 2.5% annually. 
  Between 1990 and 1995, growth was highest in the developing countries (7.3% 
  per year in the developing countries of Asia&#150;Pacific and 4.6% per year 
  in the remaining developing countries), moderate in the developed countries 
  (1.9% per year) and is actually declining at a rate of &#150;5.0% per year for 
  the EITs. Technology improvements may generate operational cost reductions that 
  have a rebound effect that stimulates further personal transportation use. These 
  issues show the necessity of both policies and behavioural changes to lower 
  emissions from the transport sector. Hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles have 
  been introduced on a commercial basis with fuel economies 50% to 100% better 
  than that of comparably sized four-passenger vehicles. The development of extremely 
  low-polluting engines may reduce the incentive for hybrid and battery electric 
  vehicles that were previously thought to encourage the adoption of vehicles 
  that would also reduce greenhouse gases. Lightweight materials have the potential 
  to improve fuel economy for all land transport. Fuel cell powered vehicles are 
  developing rapidly, and could be introduced to the market sometime during the 
  coming decade. Substantial potential for improving the fuel economy of heavy-duty 
  trucks seems feasible. Only incremental improvements of the order of 1%/yr are 
  expected for aircraft over the next several decades. There appears to be little 
  attention being given to rail or public transportation systems, but waterborne 
  transport of freight is already highly efficient, and has potential for additional 
  gains.</p>
<p>Industrial emissions account for over 40% of carbon dioxide emissions. Global 
  industrial sector carbon dioxide emissions grew at a rate of 1.5% per year between 
  1971 and 1995, slowing to 0.4% per year between 1990 and 1995. This is the only 
  sector that has shown an annual decrease in carbon emissions in industrial economies 
  (&#150;0.8% per year between 1990 and 1995) as well as in the EITs (&#150;6.4% 
  per year between 1990 and 1995). Emissions from this sector in developing countries, 
  however, continue to grow (6.3% per year in developing countries of Asia&#150;Pacific 
  and 3.4% per year in the remaining developing countries). Substantial differences 
  in the energy efficiency of industrial processes between countries exist. Improvement 
  of energy efficiency is the most important emission reduction option in the 
  short term. However, industries continue to find new, more energy efficient 
  processes which makes this option also important for the longer term. The larger 
  part of the energy can be saved at net negative costs. In addition, material 
  efficiency improvement (including more efficient product design, recycling, 
  and material substitution) can greatly contribute to reducing emissions. For 
  many sources of non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, like those from the aluminium 
  industry, and adipic acid and HCFC-22 production, substantial emission reductions 
  are possible or are already being implemented.</p>
<p>The agricultural sector has the smallest direct CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, contributing 
  4.0% of total global emissions. Growth in these emissions between 1990 and 1995 
  was greatest in the developing countries (6.0% per year in the developing countries 
  of Asia&#150;Pacific and 9.3% per year in the remaining developing countries), 
  modest in the developed countries (1.3% per year), and declined at a rate of 
  &#150;5.4% per year in the EIT. However, methane and nitrous oxide emissions 
  dominate the agricultural sector, which contributes over 20% of global anthropogenic 
  greenhouse gas emissions in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents. Reductions 
  can be made by improved farm management practices such as more efficient fertilizer 
  use, better waste treatment, use of minimum tillage techniques, and ruminant 
  methane reduction strategies. Biotechnology and genetic modification developments 
  could provide additional future gains and also lead to reduced energy demand, 
  but the conflict between food security and environmental risk is yet to be resolved. 
  Mitigation solutions exist overall for 100&#150;200MtC<sub>eq</sub>/yr but farmers 
  are unlikely to change their traditional farming methods without additional 
  incentives. Diversification of land use to energy cropping has the technical 
  potential to provide both carbon sinks and offsets in regions where suitable 
  land and water are available. Transport biofuel production costs remain high 
  compared with oil products, but do provide additional value in the form of oxygenates 
  and increased octane (ethanol). Because of market liberalization policies, the 
  potential for biofuels has declined, though there is a growing demand for biodiesel 
  in Germany. Improvements in biofuel conversion routes, such as the enzymatic 
  hydrolysis of lignocellulosic material to ethanol, may help narrow the cost 
  disadvantage versus fossil fuels. </p>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions are being lowered substantially by increased utilization 
  of methane from landfills and from coal beds for electric power generation. 
  Significant energy-related greenhouse gas reductions are identified for improved 
  waste recycling in the plastics and carpet industries, and through product remanufacturing. 
  A major discussion is taking place over whether the greater reduction in lifecycle 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions occurs through paper recycling or by utilizing waste 
  paper as a biofuel in waste to energy facilities. In several developed countries, 
  and especially in Europe and Japan, waste-to-energy facilities have become more 
  efficient with lower air pollution emissions.</p>
<p>Abundant fossil fuel reserves that are roughly five times the total carbon 
  already burned are available. The electric power sector accounts for 38% of 
  total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Low cost, aero-derivative, combined cycle gas 
  turbines with conversion efficiencies approaching 60% have become the dominant 
  option for new electric power generation plants, wherever adequate natural gas 
  supply and infrastructure are available. With deregulation of the electric power 
  sector, additional emission reductions have occurred in most countries through 
  the utilization of waste heat in combined heat and power systems that are capable 
  of utilizing 90% of the fossil fuel energy. Low carbon- emitting technologies 
  such as nuclear power have managed to significantly increase their capacity 
  factor at existing facilities, but relatively few new plants are being proposed 
  or built because of public concern about safety, waste storage, and proliferation. 
  There has also been rapid deployment of wind turbines and smaller, but expanding 
  markets for photovoltaic solar power systems. The annual growth rate from a 
  small base for both wind and solar currently exceeds 25% per year, and together 
  with an increasing number of bioenergy plants, accounts for around 2% of global 
  electricity generation. Modern biomass gasification is increasing the opportunities 
  for this renewable resource. There remains additional hydropower potential in 
  some locations, but most large sites have already been developed in many regions 
  of the world. Fuel cells appear to be a promising combined heat and electric 
  power source as part of evolving distributed generation systems.</p>
<p>Further analysis since the SAR suggests that physical sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  underground in aquifers, in depleted gas and oil fields, or in the deep ocean 
  is potentially a viable option. Technical feasibility has been demonstrated 
  for CO<sub>2</sub> removal and storage from a natural gas field, but long-term 
  storage and economic viability remain to be demonstrated. Environmental implications 
  of ocean sequestration are still being evaluated. The utilization of hydrogen 
  from fossil fuels, biomass, or solid waste followed by sequestration appears 
  particularly attractive. Along with biological sequestration, physical sequestration 
  might complement current efforts at improving energy efficiency, fuel switching, 
  and the further development and implementation of renewables, but it must compete 
  economically with them.</p>
<p>Hydrofluorocarbon (HFCs) and perfluorocarbon (PFCs) use is growing as CFCs 
  and, to a much lesser extent HCFCs, are eliminated. There is a variety of uses 
  for these substances as alternatives in refrigeration, mobile and stationary 
  air-conditioning, heat pumps, in medical and other aerosol delivery systems, 
  insulating plastic foams, and for fire suppression and solvents. The replacement 
  of ozone-depleting substances with HFCs and PFCs has been about one-tenth on 
  a mass basis, with the difference being attributed to improved containment, 
  recovery of fluids, and the use of alternative substances. The importance of 
  considering energy efficiency simultaneously with ozone layer protection is 
  discussed in the <a href="142.htm">Appendix</a>, especially in the context 
  of developing countries.</p>
<p>This chapter concludes with a quantification of the potential for reducing 
  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the various end-use sectors of the economy 
  and through changes in energy supply. It is found that sufficient technological 
  potential exists to stabilize or lower global greenhouse gas emissions by 2010, 
  and to provide for further reductions by 2020. The quantification is based on 
  sector-specific analyses and, thus, caution should be taken when adding up the 
  various estimates resulting from interactions between different types of technologies. 
  These sector-based analyses can be used to provide further understanding of 
  the results of global mitigation scenarios, such as those presented in <a href="068.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>, which account for inter-sectoral interactions, but typically do not provide 
  estimates of sectoral level GHG emissions reduction potential or costs.</p>
<p>Some of the costs associated with sector specific options for reducing GHG 
  emissions may appear high (for example US$300/tC<sub>eq</sub>). However, we 
  estimate that there is technological potential for reductions of between 1,900 
  and 2,600MtC<sub>eq</sub>/yr in 2010 and 3,600 to 5,050MtC<sub>eq</sub>/yr in 
  2020. Half of these reductions are achievable at net negative costs (value of 
  energy saved is greater than capital, operating and maintenance costs), and 
  most of the remainder is available at a cost of less than US$100tC<sub>eq</sub>/yr. 
  The continued development and adoption of a wide range of greenhouse gas mitigation 
  technologies and practices will result not only in a large technical and economic 
  potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions but will also provide continued 
  means for pursuing sustainable development goals.</p>
