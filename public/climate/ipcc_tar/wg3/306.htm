<h3>7.5.4 Broadening the National Decision-making Framework </h3>
<p>Although cost is a key component of the decision as to which policies to select, 
  it is not the only consideration. Other factors enter the decision, such as 
  the impacts of policies on different social groups in society, particularly 
  the vulnerable groups, the benefits of GHG limitation in other spheres, such 
  as reduced air pollution, and the impacts of the policies on broader concerns, 
  such as sustainability. In developing countries these other factors are even 
  more important than in developed countries. GHG limitation does not have as 
  high a priority relative to other goals, such as poverty reduction, employment, 
  etc., as it does in the wealthier countries. Indeed, it can be argued that the 
  major focus of policy will be development, poverty alleviation, etc., and that 
  GHG limitation will be an addendum to a programme designed to meet those needs. 
  Accounting for the GHG component may change the detailed design of a policy 
  or programme, rather than be the main issue that determines the policy.</p>
<p>Markandya (1998) developed a framework to expand the cost analysis with an 
  assessment of the other impacts of climate change mitigation projects, such 
  as employment, income distribution, environmental changes, and sustainability 
  indicators. The suggestion is that monetary cost and benefit estimates be combined 
  with physical indicators and qualitative information. These include the impacts 
  of projects on vulnerable groups, on the environment more generally, and on 
  sustainability in a broader sense.</p>
<p>Markandya and Boyd (1999) and Halsn&aelig;s and Markandya (1999) assessed the 
  implications for cost-effectiveness of using an expanded cost-analysis framework 
  compared with a focus on direct costs. They examined a number of case studies, 
  including renewable energy options (biogas, solar water-heating systems, photovoltaic 
  streetlights, and wind turbines), DSM programmes, and a number of transportation 
  sector options. The expanded cost assessment includes a specific valuation for 
  the welfare impacts of increased employment, local environmental improvements 
  related to reduced non-GHG pollutants, and income distribution weights. The 
  conclusion is that in a number of cases the application of an expanded cost-assessment 
  framework has major implications for the cost-effectiveness ranking of mitigation 
  projects compared with their ranking on direct costs alone. In particular, large 
  differences in cost-effectiveness are seen for a biogas plant in Tanzania, for 
  which combined social costs considered in the expanded framework go down to 
  minus US$30/tCO<sub>2</sub> reduction compared with a purely financial cost 
  of plus US$20/tCO<sub>2</sub>. This cost difference reflects a positive welfare 
  impact on presently unemployed low-income families and the time saved through 
  reduced fuelwood collection. The case examples generally suggest that the combined 
  social costs of mitigation policies in developing countries in particular will 
  be lower than the purely financial costs, especially if the policies require 
  presently unemployed labour and reduce the damages from local non-GHG pollutants. 
  Similar studies for EITs reveal great large value of ancillary benefits in the 
  form of reduced air pollution and increased employment, especially for carbon 
  sink projects.</p>
