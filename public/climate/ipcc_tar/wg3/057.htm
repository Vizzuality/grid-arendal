<h3><a name="131"></a>1.3.1 What Is the Challenge? </h3>
<p>The challenge of climate change mitigation from an equity perspective is to 
  ensure that neither the impact of climate change nor that of mitigation policies 
  exacerbates existing inequities both within and across nations. The starting 
  point for describing this challenge is the vast range of differences in incomes, 
  opportunities, capacities, and human welfare, both between and within countries. 
  This is combined with the fact that carbon emissions are closely correlated 
  to income levels&#150;both across time and across nations&#150;which suggests 
  that restrictions on such emissions may have strong distributional effects (Parikh 
  et al., 1991; Parikh et al., 1997b; Munasinghe, 2000).</p>
<p>Income and consumption, as well as vulnerability to climate change, are distributed 
  unevenly both within and between countries.<a href="fn1.htm#6" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a> 
  Concerns about the disproportionate impacts of climate change on developing 
  countries are mirrored in similar fears with regard to poor and vulnerable communities 
  within developing countries (Jamieson, 1992; Ribot et al., 1996; Reiner and 
  Jacoby, 1997). Similarly, issues of intergenerational equity have been raised 
  to caution against shifting the burden of adjustment to future generations, 
  which cannot influence political choices today (see Weiss, 1989),<a href="fn1.htm#7" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
  a theme picked up in <a href="061.htm">Section 1.4</a> below. </p>
<p>Academic and policy interest has focused on income distribution as well as 
  the poverty that underlies it. Global poverty statistics are compelling. Over 
  1.3 billion people, or more than one-fifth of the global population, are estimated 
  to be living at less than US$1 per day. Other measures of poverty and vulnerability&#150;lack 
  of access to health, education, clean water, or sanitation&#150;yield higher 
  estimates of poverty. Since poverty is concentrated in non-Annex I countries&#150;especially 
  South Asia and Africa&#150;whose average per capita income is less than one-quarter 
  (in dollars of constant Purchasing Power Parity) of the average for developed 
  countries (UNDP, 1999; World Bank, 1999), equity concerns have focused on differences 
  between rather than within countries. </p>

<p>The distributional dimension of global poverty was illustrated vividly by the 
  Human Development Report 1989 (UNDP, 1989), in the form that has come to be 
  known as the champagne glass (<a href="057.htm#fig14">Figure 1.4</a>). This 
  representation of global income distribution shows that in 1988 the richest 
  fifth of the world&#146;s population received 82.7% of the global income, which 
  is nearly 60 times the share of the income received by the poorest fifth (1.4%). 
  More recent statistics indicate that inequality has widened further since then 
  and that in 1999 the richest quintile received 80 times the income earned by 
  the poorest quintile (UNDP, 1999). </p>
<p>Besides average income levels, Annex I and non-Annex I countries differ in 
  other ways, most importantly in terms of the capacity for collective action 
  and access to technology and finance. Many non-Annex I countries face problems 
  of governance because of weak administrative infrastructures, failure to invest 
  in human and institutional capacity, lack of transparency and accountability, 
  and a high incidence of civic, political, and regional conflicts (World Bank, 
  1992; UNDP, 1997; Kaufmann et al., 1999; Knack, 2000; Thomas et al., 2000). 
  They also house a less than proportionate fraction of R&amp;D infrastructure, 
  and consequently lack access to technology and innovation. This is especially 
  important in issues of global environmental change, which are strongly science-driven 
  areas (Jamieson, 1992; Ramakrishna, 1992; Najam, 1995; Agarwal and Narain, 1999). 
  Finally, many (though not all) of these countries are over-exposed to international 
  debt&#150;and their governments to domestic debt&#150;and thus have less flexibility 
  in the choice of policy options (World Bank, 1998). </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the diversity of initial conditions in various countries, they 
  share a common commitment to the goal of economic growth, partly for its own 
  sake and partly because it is perceived as one of the means of poverty eradication 
  and capacity development. However, most analysts recognize that growth alone 
  is not a solution and it needs to be combined with ancillary policies and safeguards 
  to protect environmental and social resources. In fact, while national economic 
  growth appears to be correlated with a reduction in poverty levels (and neutral 
  with regard to national income distribution), over the past 50 years global 
  income growth has been accompanied by a worsening of global income distribution 
  (World Bank, 2000) and a persistence of poverty.<a href="fn1.htm#8" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#8","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>8</sup></small></a> 
  The concept of sustainable development has incorporated distributional aspects 
  mainly in response to these concerns (see L&eacute;l&eacute;, 1991; Murcott, 
  1997). Be that as it may, economic growth continues to be the centre of government 
  policies and plans.</p>
<p>This is relevant to climate change mitigation, since a fairly robust stylized 
  fact of historical development, consistent with both cross-country and time-series 
  data, is the close correlation between economic growth and carbon emissions. 
  <a href="057.htm#fig15">Figure 1.5</a>, for example, presents cross-country 
  data on per capita carbon emissions and income (in US$(PPP); see also <a href="057.htm#box11">Box 
  1.1</a> on a controversy over the representation of data). The bold trend line 
  highlights the proportionate increases (or, as in some economies in transition 
  recently, decreases) in per capita emissions and income over time. Broadly speaking, 
  developed countries have per capita incomes over US$(PPP)20,000 and carbon emissions 
  between 2 and 6 tonnes per capita. Non-Annex I countries have much lower incomes 
  and much lower emissions, while the economies in transition fall in the middle 
  of the range. In particular, the bulk of the world&#146;s poor live in a smaller 
  number of non-Annex I countries, which are bunched at the bottom left corner 
  of the graph, with incomes below US$(PPP)5,000 per capita, and emissions below 
  0.5tC/capita. </p>

      <br>
      A persistent theme in the literature is the explicit or implicit assignment 
      of responsibility for global warming trends. Without going into the merits 
      of the issue, it is useful to point out that many of the arguments revolve 
      around the appropriate way to represent the data. For example, Agarwal and 
      Narain (1991a) criticize the uncritical use of aggregate national emissions 
      figures, which could imply parity between developed countries and large 
      developing countries (China, India, and Brazil) mainly because of the large 
      populations of the latter. Instead, they recommend the use of per capita 
      &#147;net emissions&#148;&#150;that is, emissions that exceed the per capita 
      absorptive capacity of global carbon sinks. Other analysts distinguish between 
      &#147;necessary&#148; and &#147;luxury&#148; emissions (Agarwal et al., 
      1999; Shue, 1993). 
      <p>Another theme is the relative impact of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and that of other 
        GHGs and land-use changes, given that the latter are less strongly correlated 
        with per capita income. Most analyses have focused on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, given 
        that it constitutes the bulk of the contribution to global warming. Others 
        suggests that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are accompanied by forced cloud changes and 
        tropospheric aerosols, which offset their warming impact (Hansen et al., 
        2000). There are also debates over the precision of the estimates of these 
        associated offsets, as well as those of methane emissions in developing 
        countries (Agarwal et al., 1999). For example, Parikh et al. (1991) identify 
        potentially serious problems with World Resources Institute&#146;s deforestation 
        estimates (WRI, 1991); and Parikh (1992) shows how the IS92 IPCC scenarios 
        may have been formulated with developed country interests hard-wired into 
        them such that they could be very unfair to the developing countries. 
        In response to this criticism some of the new SRES scenarios (IPCC, 2000a) 
        explicitly explore scenarios with a narrowing income gap between the developed 
        and developing countries.</p>
      <p>Finally, &#147;per capita&#148; is not the only relevant normalization 
        (Najam and Sagar, 1998), since emissions per unit of income can also indicate 
        potential for efficiency improvements. Besides annual emissions, data 
        can also be presented in terms of atmospheric concentrations, or the contribution 
        to the global average temperature, each of which has slightly different 
        implications for the responsibility for climate change. Given the uncertainties 
        involved in constructing such estimates, the picture is not entirely clear. 
        However, most estimates suggest that the developing countries may overtake 
        Annex I countries, in terms of total annual emissions, in another 15&#150;20 
        years, and in terms of the contribution to the global average temperature 
        increase in 60&#150;90 years (Hasselmann et al., 1993; Enting, 1998; Meira, 
        1999; Pinguelli Rosa and Ribeiro, 2000). </p>

<p>Useful analytical tools in this regard are various decomposition approaches<a href="fn1.htm#9" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#9","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>9</sup></small></a> 
  that represent carbon emissions as the product of three factors, carbon intensity 
  (emissions per unit of income), affluence (income per capita), and population. 
  The decomposition suggests that reconciliation of the goals of emissions abatement 
  and economic growth must involve a combination of population decline and technological 
  and managerial improvements that lead to lower carbon intensity. Some potential 
  for improvement is evident from <a href="057.htm#fig15">Figure 1.5</a>, namely 
  the large differences in per capita emissions of countries and regions at the 
  same level of affluence (e.g., Hong Kong, Switzerland, Singapore, Japan, and 
  the USA). This suggests the possibility of technological &#147;leap-frogging&#148; 
  (see Goldemberg, 1998a, Schneider, 1998), that is the lowering of emissions 
  by a factor of two or three without impacting income levels through investment 
  in technological development and capacity building.<a href="fn1.htm#10" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>10</sup></small></a> 
  However, the operational and other obstacles against the realization of these 
  possibilities have not been analyzed systematically in the literature.</p>
<p>In the absence of such investment, economic growth and conventional economic 
  development are likely to remain strongly linked to the ability to emit unlimited 
  amounts of carbon. Therefore, restrictions on emissions will continue to be 
  viewed by many people in developing countries as yet another constraint on the 
  development process. The mitigation challenge, therefore, is to decouple growth 
  and economic development from emission increases. </p>
<p>However, mitigation policies in general, and its decoupling from economic growth 
  in particular, have to be designed with specific contexts in mind. Policies 
  designed for one context are generally not appropriate for another (Shue, 1993; 
  Rahman, 1996; Jepma and Munasinghe, 1998), and identical ultimate goals&#150;stabilization 
  of GHG accumulation and maintenance or achievement of the quality of life&#150;yield 
  different priorities and strategies in Annex I and non-Annex I countries. In 
  the former, these goals are translated as reducing emissions while improving 
  the quality of life, and in the latter it is the other way around&#150;improving 
  the quality of life, inter alia, by maintaining the rate of economic growth, 
  while maintaining or lowering per capita emissions. </p>
<p>The current global response to this situation is to exempt non-Annex I countries 
  from climate obligations to allow them to pursue their developmental goals freely. 
  Furthermore, UNFCCC as well as subsequent agreements stipulate the provision 
  of financial and technological resources for voluntary mitigation actions by 
  this group of countries. Finally, the Kyoto Protocol created the CDM to enable 
  developing countries to contribute to emissions abatement while pursuing sustainable 
  development. </p>
<p>As non-Annex I emissions continue to grow, however, this strategy may become 
  inadequate, and more innovative mitigation efforts might be called for in non-Annex 
  I countries. This will mean divergences of the development path of the currently 
  developing countries from that which developed countries have displayed (Munasinghe, 
  1994; Jacoby et al., 1998; Najam and Sagar, 1998; Barrett, 1999). As the UNDP 
  Human Development Report (1998, p.7) points out, &#147;Poor countries need to 
  accelerate their consumption growth &#150; but they need not follow the path 
  taken by the rich and high-growth economies over the past half century.&#148;</p>
<p>Some simple calculations can help illustrate the nature of the global mitigation 
  challenge. Current per capita carbon emissions are slightly more than 3 tonnes 
  per year in Annex I countries and slightly less than 0.5 tonnes per year in 
  non-Annex I countries. With about 1.3 billion people living in Annex I countries 
  and about 4.7 billion in non-Annex I countries, total carbon emissions are in 
  the range of (3.1)(1.3) + (0.48)(4.7) = 6.29 billion tonnes. Thus carbon emissions 
  at a global scale average about 1 tonne per capita per year. The stabilization 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the atmosphere at 450, 550, 650, and 750ppmv will require 
  steep declines in the aggregate emissions as well emissions per capita and per 
  dollar of gross domestic product (GDP) as illustrated in the IPCC SAR Synthesis 
  Report (IPCC, 1996). For example, based on the SAR Synthesis Report and a recent 
  set of calculations by Bolin and Kheshgi (2000), stabilization of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  in the atmosphere at 450, 550, 650, and 750ppmv would require limiting fossil-fuel 
  carbon emissions at about 3, 6, 9 and 12 billion tonnes, respectively, by 2100 
  and further reductions thereafter to less than half current global emissions. 
  If, for example, the world population stabilized at about 10 billion people 
  by then, an average carbon emissions per capita of 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 tonnes 
  of carbon would be required to achieve the 450, 550, 650, and 750ppmv limits, 
  respectively. We make no assumption here about how these emissions would or 
  should be allocated globally, but simply report that the average by 2100 must 
  work out to these levels to achieve the stabilization objectives. Thus, to achieve 
  a 450ppmv concentration target, average carbon emissions per capita globally 
  need to drop from about 1 tonne today to about 0.3 tons in 2100; to achieve 
  a 650ppmv target they need to drop to 0.9 tonnes (about one-quarter of current 
  emissions per capita in the Annex I countries) by 2100 and further thereafter. 
  Finally, with a global economy currently producing about 25 trillion dollars 
  of output, carbon emissions per million dollars of output are currently about 
  240 tonnes. If, for example, the global economy grows to 200 trillion dollars 
  of output by 2100, the emissions per million dollars (in year 2000 dollars) 
  would need to be limited to about 10, 25, 40, and 55 tonnes of carbon in order 
  to achieve the 450, 550, 650, and 750ppmv CO<sub>2</sub> limits, respectively. If further 
  population and economic growth continues beyond 2100 additional reductions in 
  average emissions per capita and per unit of economic output would be required.<br>
  <br>
  This framing of the mitigation challenge is central to the literature on global 
  equity and climate change. Virtually all stabilization trajectories in the literature 
  show an initially rising trend of aggregate global emissions, followed by a 
  declining trend; and they also show a gradual narrowing of the gap between per 
  capita emissions of various countries and regions. In many of these scenarios, 
  over a finite period of time, aggregate net global emissions contract to levels 
  consistent with the absorptive capacity of global sinks, while per capita emissions 
  of Annex I and non-Annex I countries move towards convergence in the interest 
  of global equity. One possible international regime to achieve stabilization 
  would initially have only Annex I emissions decline over a period of time (to 
  make room for the growth prospects and therefore rising emissions of non-Annex 
  I countries). At the same time, as per capita emissions of both groups decline 
  and converge, aggregate emissions also decline&#150;in some scenarios to close 
  to a carbon-free situation. There are in principle many other approaches to 
  an equitable international regime, that are discussed in <a href="058.htm">Section 
  1.3.2</a>. </p>
<p>For the purposes of this chapter, it is convenient to divide the required emissions 
  trajectory into three segments. Phase 1, an upward sloping segment of the non-Annex 
  I trajectory, may require only marginal deviations in baseline emissions, for 
  which the assessment of policy options entails a central attention to the costs 
  and benefits of mitigation. However, for options relevant for Phase 2, a downward 
  sloping segment of non-Annex I emissions, in which deeper cuts may be called 
  for, global equity issues will need greater attention. Finally, the policy options 
  that can help realize Phase 3, the asymptotic segment of the trajectory, revolve 
  to a greater extent around sustainability concerns. <br>
