<h3>10.4.5 Who Should Pay for the Response? Mitigation by Countries and Sectors: 
  Equity and Cost-effectiveness Considerations </h3>
<p>Equity and efficiency considerations in the context of decision making that 
  addresses global climate change are important for various reasons, including 
  ethical concerns, effectiveness, sustainable development, and implementation 
  of UNFCCC itself (Munasinghe, 1998; see also <a href="048.htm">Chapter 1</a>). 
  Principles of justice and fairness<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#40","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>40</sup></small></a> 
  are important in themselves, in all types of human interactions, and play a 
  major role in practically all modern international agreements, including the 
  UN Charter; they emphasize the basic equality of all humans (Jepma and Munasinghe, 
  1998).</p>
<p>Some authors argue that equitable decisions generally carry greater legitimacy 
  and encourage parties with differing interests to co-operate better in carrying 
  out mutually agreed actions. One of the major obstacles to reaching a comprehensive 
  agreement on global warming&#151;setting GHG emission limitation targets for 
  individual countries&#151;involves parties that act as a &#147;veto&#148; because 
  they regard particular arrangements as unfair or unjust. Decisions that are 
  widely accepted as equitable are likely to be implemented with greater willingness 
  than those enforced under conditions of mistrust (Rowlands, 1997). Others find 
  little evidence that fairness matters much. Victor (1999) examines the relationships 
  between fairness and the compliance with international environmental agreements 
  through the lessons learned about implementation and effectiveness of numerous 
  earlier treaties. His conclusion is that equity concerns matter little in the 
  success of negotiating and implementing such agreements. Even for cases in which 
  fairness seems to play some role, willingness to pay had a stronger role. Victor 
  argues that if parties to an agreement take the trouble to deviate from the 
  simplest across-the-board commitments, then many criteria need to be considered 
  in negotiating commitments. Fairness might be one criterion, but is probably 
  not the most important.</p>
<p>In a broader context, equity and fairness are important elements of the social 
  dimension, while efficiency is a crucial factor in the economic dimension of 
  sustainable development. The impetus of sustainable development provides a crucial 
  reason for finding efficient and equitable solutions to the problem of global 
  warming, especially with regard to future generations. The UNFCCC recognizes 
  these two principles in Article 3.1.</p>
<p>Equity principles apply to both procedural and consequential issues (Banuri 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996). Procedural issues concern the process of how decisions are made. 
  The two aspects of procedural equity involve the effective participation in 
  decision-making processes and the process itself, which should be the principle 
  of equal treatment before the law. In this context, reference is made to Coase&#146;s 
  model of social cost (1960) in that he assumes a situation of equal bargaining 
  power among participants and equal distribution of the costs of making the bargain 
  with respect to the internalization of externalities. The philosophical notion 
  of procedural equity is the &#147;ideal speech situation&#148; (Habermas, 1981), 
  a situation in which dialogue and decision making are free from inappropriate 
  constraints such as barriers to the acquisition of knowledge or financial resources. 
  Transfer of these concepts to climate change negotiations requires consideration 
  of the influence of scientific information, human resources, institutional capacities, 
  and financial assets on the bargaining, and a redistribution of these among 
  participants to create procedural equity.</p>
<p>Consequential equity deals with the outcome of decision making, and with the 
  distribution of costs and benefits of preventing global warming (including future 
  emission rights) and of coping with the climate change impacts and adaptation. 
  The consequential decisions have implications for burden sharing among and within 
  countries (intragenerational and spatial distribution) and between present and 
  future generations (intergenerational and temporal distribution). While actions 
  to mitigate climate change have to be paid for by the present generation, benefits 
  in the sense of avoided losses will affect generations to come. This involves 
  discounting future benefits to a net present value (Portney and Weyant, 1999). 
  However, most of the potentially affected parties are not present to participate 
  in the decision making, so that the current generation has to discuss equity 
  issues within climate change.</p>
<p>In total, four kinds of questions frame the issue of justice in climate change 
  (Shue, 1993), of which the third (procedural equity) provides the basis for 
  a just process in determining the other three kinds of allocations.</p>
<ol>
  <li> What is a fair allocation of the costs of preventing the global warming 
    that is still avoidable?<br>
  </li>
  <li>What is a fair allocation of the costs of coping with the social consequences 
    of the global warming that will not be avoided?<br>
  </li>
  <li> What background allocation of wealth would allow international bargaining 
    about issues like (1) and (2) to be a fair process?<br>
  </li>
  <li> What is a fair allocation of emissions of GHGs over the long term and during 
    the transition to the long-term allocation?</li>
</ol>
<p>To answer these questions scientists have developed typologies for the various 
  distributional equity principles; these are understood to be general concepts 
  of distributive justice and fairness, which often overlap. Associated burden-sharing 
  rules, on the other hand, represent an operational function to generate a specific 
  scheme to reduce GHG emissions or to bear the costs of climate change impacts. 
  <a href="#tab109">Table 10.9</a> gives an overview of general equity principles 
  and accompanying operational rules (Thompson and Rayner, 1998).</p>
