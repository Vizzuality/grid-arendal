<h2><a name="43"></a>4.3 Mitigation Options</h2>
<p>In tropical regions there are large opportunities for C mitigation, though 
  they cannot be considered in isolation of broader policies in forestry, agriculture, 
  and other sectors. Additionally, options vary by social and economic conditions: 
  in some regions slowing or halting deforestation is the major mitigation opportunity; 
  in other regions, where deforestation rates have declined to marginal levels, 
  improved natural forest management practices, afforestation, and reforestation 
  of degraded forests and wastelands are the most attractive opportunities. However, 
  the current mitigative capacity<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#11","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>11</a></sup></small> 
  is often weak and sufficient land and water is not always available.</p>
<p>Non-tropical countries also have opportunities to preserve existing C pools, 
  enhance C pools, or use biomass to offset fossil fuel use. Examples of strategies 
  include fire or insect control, forest conservation, establishing fast-growing 
  stands, changing silvicultural practices, planting trees in urban areas, ameliorating 
  waste management practices, managing agricultural lands to store more C in soils, 
  improving management of grazing lands, and re-planting grasses or trees on cultivated 
  lands. </p>
<p>Wood and other biological products play several important roles in carbon mitigation: 
  they act as a carbon reservoir; they can replace construction materials that 
  require more fossil fuel input; and they can be burned in place of fossil fuels 
  for renewable energy. Wood products already contribute somewhat to climate mitigation, 
  but if infrastructures and incentives can be developed, wood and agricultural 
  products may become a vital element of a sustainable economy: they are among 
  the few renewable resources available on a large scale.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="44"></a>4.4 Criteria for Biological Carbon Mitigation Options</h2>
<p>To develop strategies that mitigate atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and advance 
  other, equally important objectives, the following criteria merit consideration: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li> potential contributions to C pools over time;</li>
  <li>sustainability, security, resilience, permanence, and robustness of the 
    C pool maintained or created;</li>
  <li>compatibility with other land-use objectives; </li>
  <li>leakage and additionality issues; </li>
  <li>economic costs; </li>
  <li>environmental impacts other than climate mitigation; </li>
  <li>social, cultural, and cross-cutting issues, as well as issues of equity; 
    and </li>
  <li>the system-wide effects on C flows in the energy and materials sector. </li>
</ul>
<p>Activities undertaken for other reasons may enhance mitigation. An obvious 
  example is reduced rates of tropical deforestation. Furthermore, because wealthy 
  countries generally have a stable forest estate, it could be argued that economic 
  development is associated with activities that build up forest carbon reservoirs.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="45"></a>4.5 Economic Costs</h2>
<p>Most studies suggest that the economic costs of some biological carbon mitigation 
  options, particularly forestry options, are quite modest through a range. Cost 
  estimates of biological mitigation reported to date vary significantly from 
  US$0.1/tC to about US$20/tC in several tropical countries and from US$20 to 
  US$100/tC in non-tropical countries. Moreover the cost calculations do not cover, 
  in many instances, inter alia, costs for infrastructure, appropriate discounting, 
  monitoring, data collection and interpretation, and opportunity costs of land 
  and maintenance, or other recurring costs, which are often excluded or overlooked. 
  The lower end of the ranges are biased downwards, but understanding and treatment 
  of costs is improving over time. Furthermore, in many cases biological mitigation 
  activities may have other positive impacts, such as protecting tropical forests 
  or creating new forests with positive external environmental effects. However, 
  costs rise as more biological mitigation options are exercised and as the opportunity 
  costs of the land increases. Biological mitigation costs appear to be lowest 
  in developing countries and higher in developed countries. If biological mitigation 
  activities are modest, leakage is likely to be small. However, the amount of 
  leakage could rise if biological mitigation activities became large and widespread.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="46"></a>4.6 Marine Ecosystem and Geo-engineering </h2>
<p>Marine ecosystems may also offer possibilities for removing CO<sub>2</sub> 
  from the atmosphere. The standing stock of C in the marine biosphere is very 
  small, however, and efforts could focus, not on increasing biological C stocks, 
  but on using biospheric processes to remove C from the atmosphere and transport 
  it to the deep ocean. Some initial experiments have been performed, but fundamental 
  questions remain about the permanence and stability of C removals, and about 
  unintended consequences of the large-scale manipulations required to have a 
  significant impact on the atmosphere. In addition, the economics of such approaches 
  have not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Geo-engineering involves efforts to stabilize the climate system by directly 
  managing the energy balance of the earth, thereby overcoming the enhanced greenhouse 
  effect. Although there appear to be possibilities for engineering the terrestrial 
  energy balance, human understanding of the system is still rudimentary. The 
  prospects of unanticipated consequences are large, and it may not even be possible 
  to engineer the regional distribution of temperature, precipitation, etc. Geo-engineering 
  raises scientific and technical questions as well as many ethical, legal, and 
  equity issues. And yet, some basic inquiry does seem appropriate. </p>
<p>In practice, by the year 2010 mitigation in land use, land-use change, and 
  forestry activities can lead to significant mitigation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 
  Many of these activities are compatible with, or complement, other objectives 
  in managing land. The overall effects of altering marine ecosystems to act as 
  carbon sinks or of applying geo-engineering technology in climate change mitigation 
  remain unresolved and are not, therefore, ready for near-term application.</p>
