<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>In recent years a good deal of analytical work has addressed problem-solving 
  strategies for different circumstances characterized by the inherent uncertainties 
  in the situation and the severity of consequences that arise from the decision 
  to be made. Adaptive management approaches to decision making start by accepting 
  uncertainty as an inherent property of complex systems. The issue here is not 
  the problem of a &#147;deterministic version of scientific uncertainty&#148;&#151;a 
  temporary matter of imprecision which will be eradicated when enough research 
  has been devoted to the questions (Wynne, 1994). The starting point is the acknowledgement 
  that uncertainty emerges not only from the long time-scales involved and/or 
  the ability of models to predict long-term events, but mainly from the endemic 
  uncertainty, indeterminacy, and ignorance related to the co-evolution of natural 
  and social systems. Furthermore, these methods stress the relevance of values, 
  ethical and social, and thus introduce the need for public discourse and debate 
  (Westra, 1997).</p>
<p>A central concern in adaptive approaches is with the plurality of value systems 
  and how multiple perspectives can inform the decision process. Various attempts 
  have been made to incorporate a variety of perspectives in relation to uncertainty 
  and to make uncertainty more explicit by expressing it in terms of risk.</p>
<p>Parallel modelling (Visser <i>et al</i>., 2000) and computational, multiscenario simulation 
  (Lempert <i>et al</i>., 1996; Morgan and Dowlatabadi, 1996; van Asselt and Rotmans, 
  1997) are emerging approaches based on the idea that multiple views of the future 
  are crucial to allow groups to transmit and receive information about highly 
  uncertain futures. </p>
<p>Rather than aggregate different scenario or model results using probabilistic 
  weights or using computer resources to increase the resolution of a single best-estimate 
  model, analysts use simulation models to construct different scenarios to compare 
  different, alternative policy options based on their robustness across the scenarios. 
  Valuation is thus reframed as a process in which uncertainty is not banished, 
  but is managed, and values are not presupposed but are made explicit. </p>
<p>The analysis of multiple and diverse perspectives as a source of uncertainty 
  has been addressed by van Asselt and Rotmans (1997) within the framework of 
  the Tool to Assess Regional and Global Environmental and health Targets for 
  Sustainability (TARGETS) IAM. The authors introduce the idea of model routes&#150;a 
  chain of biased interpretations of the crucial uncertainties in the model&#150;to 
  analyze differences in future projections as the outcome of divergent views 
  and valuations, instead of merely of low, high, and medium values. The approach 
  distinguishes two dimensions of perspectives: (1) a world view, which entails 
  a coherent view of how the world functions, and (2) a management style, that 
  is policy preferences and strategies. By combining stereotypical views of nature 
  and humanity as well as ethical attitudes with different management styles, 
  the approach enables the analysis of &#147;utopias&#148; that result when views 
  match the strategies and &#147;dystopias&#148; that result when they do not.</p>
<p>Dystopias are useful with respect to communicating the role of uncertainty 
  and its consequences for decision making. They indicate the risk of decision 
  making in uncertain conditions by showing to what kind of future the chosen 
  strategies might lead, in the event that the adopted worldview fails to describe 
  the reality adequately.</p>
<p>Another promising avenue for managing uncertainties is the exploratory modelling 
  methods (Lempert <i>et al</i>., 1996; Lempert <i>et al</i>., 2000; Lempert and Schlesinger, 
  2000; and Robalino and Lempert, 2000) is discussed in <a href="389.htm#10141">Section 
  10.1.4.1</a>. </p>
<p>Robustness is not a new concept, but it is just recently, under the pressure 
  of global environmental problems and the acceleration of change, that such approaches 
  have grown in formalization and sophistication (Rosenhead, 1990). Rooted in 
  Savage&#146;s maximizing the minimum regret (1954), Simon&#146;s ideas of satisfying 
  strategies (1959 a and b), and Lindbolm&#146;s incremental policies (1959), 
  the search for robust strategies as a formal decision-making criterion has grown 
  during the 1990s. However, it has always been more difficult to implement robustness, 
  as opposed to optimization, within an analytical method, except for in very 
  special cases. A new development over the past few years is that it is now becoming 
  possible to implement robustness as an analytical criterion using simulation 
  models of the type relevant to climate change policy. In conclusion, multiscenario 
  simulation approaches, like multiple-model routes, exploratory models, or parallel 
  modelling, show that uncertainty is no longer a theoretical scientific concept, 
  but a notion that might be usefully deployed by decision makers in arriving 
  at their decisions (van Asselt and Rotmans, 1997).</p>
<p>This ability to analytically address robustness is closely tied to the idea 
  of adaptive decision strategies, that is, strategies that can change over time 
  in response to observations of the climate and economic systems. (Adaptive decision 
  strategies differ from sequential strategies in that in the former information 
  is endogenous, that is, the type, rate, and quality of information gained depends 
  on both the unfolding scenario and policy choices whereas information is exogenous 
  in the sequential strategies.) Adaptive decision strategies are closely tied 
  to the concept of robustness, because such strategies are most useful in situations 
  of deep uncertainty&#150;where robustness, as opposed to optimization, appears 
  to be the best decision-making criterion.</p>
