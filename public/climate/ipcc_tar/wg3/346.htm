<h2>8.4 Social, Environmental, and Economic Impacts of Alternative Pathways for 
  Meeting a Range of Concentration Stabilization Pathways</h2>

<p><a name="fig8-12"></a>The appropriate timing of mitigation pathways depends 
  upon many factors including the economic characteristics of different pathways, 
  the uncertainties about the ultimate objective, and the risks and damages implied 
  by different rates and levels of atmospheric change. This section focuses upon 
  the mitigation costs of different pathways towards a predetermined concentration 
  ceiling. No policy conclusion should be derived from it before reading <a href="379.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>, which discusses mitigation timing in the wider context of uncertainties, 
  risks and impacts.</p>
<h3><a name="841"></a>8.4.1 Alternative Pathways for Stabilization Concentrations</h3>
<div align="right"> 
  <div align="left">A given concentration ceiling can be achieved through a variety 
    of emission pathways. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig8-12">Figure 8.12.</a> 
    The top panel shows alternative concentration profiles for stabilization at 
    350-750ppmv. The bottom panel shows the corresponding emission trajectories. 
    In each case, two different routes to stabilization are shown: the IPCC Working 
    Group I profiles (from IPCC, 1995) and Wigley, Richels and Edmonds (WRE) profiles 
    (from Wigley <i>et al., </i>1996). The choice of emission pathways can be 
    thought of as a carbon budget allocation problem. To a first approximation, 
    a concentration target defines an allowable amount of carbon to be emitted 
    into the atmosphere between now and some date in the future. The issue is 
    how best to allocate this budget over time. A number of modellers have attempted 
    to address this issue. Unfortunately, to model stabilization costs is a daunting 
    task. It is difficult enough to forecast the evolution of the energy and economic 
    system to 2010. Projections over a century or more are necessary, but must 
    be treated with considerable caution. They provide useful information, but 
    their value lies not in the specific numbers but in the insights.</div>
</div>
<p>This section examines how mitigation costs might vary both with the stabilization 
  level and with the pathway to stabilization. Also discussed are key assumptions 
  that influence mitigation cost projections. Important, this discussion begins 
  with the assumption that the stabilization ceiling is known with certainty and 
  neglects the costs of different damages associated with different pathways (discussed 
  in <a href="379.htm">Chapter 10</a>). Here, the challenge is to identify 
  the least-cost mitigation pathway to stay within the prescribed ceiling. In 
  <a href="379.htm">Chapter 10</a>, the issue of decision-making under uncertainty 
  is discussed regarding the ultimate target and impacts of different pathways. 
  Decision making under uncertainty requires indeed examining symmetrically the 
  costs of accelerating the abatement in case of negative surprises about damages 
  of climate change and adopting a prudent near-term hedging strategy. That is, 
  one that balances the risks of acting too slowly to reduce emissions with the 
  risks of acting too aggressively.</p>

<p><a name="fig8-13"></a>Some insight into the characteristics of the least-cost 
  mitigation pathway can be obtained from two EMF studies (EMF-14, 1997; EMF-16, 
  1999) and from <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a> in the SRES mitigation scenarios 
  (IPCC, 2000). In the first EMF study, modellers compared mitigation costs associated 
  with stabilizing concentrations at 550ppmv using the WGI and WRE profiles (see 
  <a href="#fig8-12">Figure 8.12</a>), Note that the WGI pathway entails lower 
  emissions in the early years, with less rapid reductions later on. The WRE pathway 
  allows for a more gradual near-term transition away from carbon-venting fuels. 
  <a href="#fig8-13">Figure 8.13</a> shows that in these models the more gradual 
  near-term transition of the two examined results in lower mitigation costs.</p>
<div align="left"></div>
<p>The above experiment compares mitigation costs for two emission pathways for 
  stabilizing concentrations at 550ppmv. It does not identify the least-cost mitigation 
  pathway, however. This was done in the subsequent EMF (1997) study. The results 
  are presented in <a href="#fig8-14">Figure 8.14.</a> In these studies the least-cost 
  mitigation pathway tends to follow the models reference case in the early years 
  with sharper reductions later on. </p>
<p>The selection of a 550ppmv target was purely arbitrary and not meant to imply 
  an optimal concentrations target. Given the present lack of consensus on what 
  constitutes &#147;dangerous&#148; interference with the climate system, three 
  models in the EMF-16 study examined how mitigation costs are projected to vary 
  under alternative targets. The results are summarized in <a href="#fig8-15">Figure 
  8.15.</a> As would be expected, mitigation costs increase with more stringent 
  stabilization targets.</p>
<div align="right"> </div>
<p>In <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a>, nine modelling groups reported scenario 
  scenario results using different baseline scenarios. An analysis focused on 
  the results of stabilizing the SRES A1B scenario at 550 and 450ppmv provides 
  additional insight into the relationship between mitigation and baseline emissions. 
  For the 550ppmv case, there are eight relevant trajectories (see <a href="347.htm#fig8-16">Figure 
  8.16</a>) giving the carbon reductions necessary to achieve a stabilization 
  level of 550ppmv, where the models which impose a long-term cost minimization 
  (LTCM) are represented as solid lines, and the models which use an external 
  trajectory as the basis for their mitigation strategy are presented as dashed 
  lines. The first impression of <a href="347.htm#fig8-16">Figure 8.16</a> is 
  that even given common assumptions about GDP, population, and final energy use, 
  and a common stabilization goal, there is still a lot of difference in the model 
  results. A preliminary examination suggests that, in contrast to the non-optimization 
  model results, a common characteristic among the LTCM models is that the near-term 
  emissions pathways departs only gradually from the baseline.</p>
<div align="right"> </div>
<p><a href="347.htm#fig8-17">Figure 8.17</a> clarifies the results by converting 
  the absolute reduction to a percent reduction basis and averages them for the 
  two classes of models. LTCM models show clearly a more gradual departure from 
  the emissions baseline. Figure 8.17 also gives comparable results for the four 
  cases with a 450ppmv target. The LTCM show a very similar decoupling until 2030, 
  when this decoupling increases rapidly, and exceeds the other models by 2050, 
  earlier in the 450ppmv case than in the 550ppmv case.<a name="fig8-14"></a><a name="fig8-15"></a></p>
