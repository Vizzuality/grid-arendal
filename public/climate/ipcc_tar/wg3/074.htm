<p>From the large number of mitigation scenarios, a selection must be made in 
  order to clarify in a manageable way the quantitative characteristics of mitigation 
  scenarios. One of the efficient ways to analyze them is to focus on a typical 
  mitigation target. As the most frequently studied mitigation target is the 550ppmv 
  stabilization scenario, a total of 31 stabilization scenarios adopting that 
  target were selected along with their baseline (reference or non-intervention) 
  scenarios in order to analyze the characteristics of the stabilization scenarios 
  as well as their baselines<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#5","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>5</sup></small></a>. 
  <a href="#fig22">Figure 2.2</a> shows these baseline scenarios, and <a href="#fig23">Figure 
  2.3</a> shows the mitigation scenarios for 550ppmv stabilization. (The sources 
  and scenario names are noted in <a href="088.htm">Appendix 2.1</a>).</p>
<a name="2321"></a> 
<h4>2.3.2.1 Characteristics of Baseline Scenarios</h4>
<p>In order to analyze the characteristics of stabilization scenarios, it is very 
  important to identify the features of the baseline scenarios that have been 
  used for mitigation quantification. Although the general characteristics of 
  non-intervention scenarios have already been analyzed in the SRES (Nakicenovic 
  <i>et al.</i>, 2000), more specific analyses are conducted here, focusing on the baseline 
  scenarios that have been used for 550ppmv stabilization quantification.</p>
<p>First, it is clear that the range of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in baseline scenarios 
  used for 550ppmv stabilization quantification is very wide at the global level, 
  as shown in <a href="#fig22">Figure 2.2</a>. The maximum levels of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions represent more than ten times the current levels, while the minimum 
  level represents four times current levels. The range of baseline scenarios 
  covers the upper half of the total range of the database, and most of them were 
  estimated to be larger than IS92a (IPCC 1992 scenario &#147;a&#148;). This means 
  that the baseline scenarios used for the 550ppmv stabilization analyses have 
  a very wide range and are high relative to other studies.</p>
<p>This divergence can be explained by the Kaya identity (Kaya, 1990), which separates 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions into three factors: gross domestic product (GDP), energy 
  intensity, and carbon intensity<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn2.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a>:<br>
</p>
<div align="center">CO<sub>2</sub> emissions = GDP * Energy intensity * Carbon 
  intensity = GDP * (energy/GDP) * (emissions/energy) </div>
<p><a href="#fig24">Figure 2.4</a> shows these factors. For comparability of the 
  factors, which were not harmonized to be the same number among models in the 
  base year of 1990, all the values are indexed to 1990 levels. CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions are mostly determined by energy consumption. This, in turn, is determined 
  by the levels of GDP, energy intensity, and carbon intensity. However, the ranges 
  of GDP and of carbon intensities in the scenarios are larger than the range 
  of energy intensities. This suggests that the large range of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions in the scenarios is primarily a reflection of the large ranges of 
  GDP and carbon intensity in the scenarios. Thus, the assumptions made about 
  economic growth and energy supply result in huge variations in CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emission projections.</p>
<p>These characteristics are also observed in regional scenarios. For example, 
  in both the OECD and non-OECD scenarios, CO<sub>2</sub>, GDP, energy intensity, 
  and carbon intensity have wide ranges, and in particular, the range among scenarios 
  for the non-OECD nations is wider than the range among scenarios for OECD nations. 
  In addition, the growth of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in non-OECD nations is generally 
  larger than the growth of emissions in OECD nations. This is mainly caused by 
  higher GDP growth in the non-OECD countries.</p>
<p>With regard to regional comparisons, it is very difficult to come to any general 
  conclusions, as the ranges involved in the regional scenarios are extraordinarily 
  large. Moreover, with the exception of the USA, Europe, the Former Soviet Union 
  (FSU) and China, the number of available scenarios is limited. However, some 
  general trends can be identified that are associated with the medium ranges 
  of the scenarios: for Asian countries, GDP growth is the most significant factor, 
  resulting in high levels of energy use and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; energy 
  efficiency improvements are the most significant factor in the scenarios for 
  China; and carbon intensity reductions are very high in Africa, Latin America, 
  and Southeast Asia, because of drastic energy mix changes.</p>
<p>Other interesting characteristics at the global level can be identified in 
  the relationships among GDP, energy intensity, and carbon intensity. <a href="#fig25">Figure 
  2.5</a> shows a scatter plot of GDP growth rate versus energy intensity reduction 
  from the baseline scenarios. As might be expected, the energy intensity reduction 
  is higher with a higher GDP growth rate, while a lower energy intensity reduction 
  is associated with a lower GDP growth rate. This relationship suggests that 
  high economic growth scenarios assume high levels of progress in end-use technologies. 
</p>
Unlike energy intensity reductions, carbon intensity reductions in the models 
are apparently seen as largely independent of economic growth and consequently 
are a function of societal choices, including energy and environmental policies. 
The scenarios do not show any clear relationship between energy intensity reduction 
and carbon intensity reduction. The values depend on regional characteristics 
in energy systems and technology combinations. Energy intensity reduction can 
include many measures other than fuel shifting. Most of the efficiency measures 
will result in lower carbon emissions, and fuel shifts from high-carbon to low- 
or non-carbon fuels can increase the efficiency of energy systems in many cases. 
However, carbon intensity reductions can also lead to reduced efficiency in energy 
systems, as in the case of shifts to biomass gasification or liquefaction, or 
result in increased energy consumption, as in the case of industrial carbon sequestration.

      <p><b>Box 2.3. Non-CO<sub>2</sub> Mitigation Scenarios</b></p>
      <p>Since the publication of IPCC&#146;s SAR, the literature on mitigation 
        scenarios has continued to focus on the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
        rather than on other GHGs. This is unfortunate because non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions make up a significant fraction of the total &#147;basket of 
        gases&#148; that must be reduced under the Kyoto Protocol. However, a 
        small set of papers has reported on scenarios for mitigating non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
        gases, especially CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O. In one such paper, 
        Reilly <i>et al.</i> (1999) compared scenarios for achieving emission reductions 
        with and without non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Annex B countries (those 
        countries that are included in emission controls under the Kyoto Protocol). 
        Scenarios that omitted measures for reducing non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases 
        had 21% higher annual costs in 2010 than those that included them. Tuhkanen 
        <i>et al.</i> (1999) and Lehtil&auml; <i>et al.</i> (1999) came to similar conclusions 
        &#151; in a scenario analysis for 2010, they found that including CH<sub>4</sub> 
        and N<sub>2</sub>O in mitigation strategies for Finland reduced annual 
        costs by 20% in the year 2010 relative to a baseline scenario. The general 
        conclusion of these papers is that small reductions of GHG emissions, 
        for example of the magnitude required by the Kyoto Protocol, can be accomplished 
        at a lower cost by taking into account measures to reduce non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
        gases, and that a small reduction of non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases can produce 
        large impacts at low cost because of the high global warming potential 
        (GWP) of these gases. </p>
      <p>In another type of scenario analysis, Alcamo and Kreileman (1996) used 
        the IMAGE 2 model to evaluate the environmental consequences of a large 
        set of non-CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation scenarios. They 
        concluded that non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would have to be controlled 
        along with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in order to slow the increase of atmospheric 
        temperature to below prescribed levels. Hayhoe <i>et al.</i> (1999) pointed out 
        two additional benefits of mitigating CH<sub>4</sub>, an important non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
        gas. First, most CH<sub>4</sub> reduction measures do not require the 
        turnover of capital stock (as do CO<sub>2</sub> measures), and can therefore 
        be carried out more rapidly than CO<sub>2</sub> reduction measures. Second, 
        CH<sub>4</sub> reductions will have a more immediate impact on mitigating 
        climate change than CO<sub>2</sub> reductions because the atmosphere responds 
        more rapidly to changes in CH<sub>4</sub> than to CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.<br>
