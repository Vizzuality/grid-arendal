<h4>10.3.2.5 Synergies, Trade-offs, and No Regrets </h4>
<p>The existence of ancillary benefits and synergies in implementing mitigation 
  options has been addressed in a preliminary way in IPCC (1996c). These issues 
  are discussed in detail in <a href="266.htm">Chapters 7</a>, <a href="319.htm">8</a> 
  and <a href="353.htm">9</a>. Some relevant findings are highlighted here. 
  The adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices in Africa (Sokona <i>et al</i>., 1999) illustrates clearly the mutually reinforcing effects of climate change 
  mitigation, environmental protection, and economic benefits. In fact, the introduction 
  or expansion of agroforestry and organic agriculture (i.e., methods that intensify 
  agricultural production while using less input), can improve food security and 
  at the same time reduce GHG emissions. In agroforestry systems, trees are planted 
  to delineate plots of land, and further to fix nitrogen, causing the nutrients 
  lower in the soil to rise up. The trees also prevent soil erosion, supply firewood 
  and animal fodder, and constitute a source of income. Organic farming improves 
  the fertility of the soil through the addition of organic matter. The damage 
  and diseases caused by insects are virtually eliminated through the technique 
  of &#147;growing in corridors&#148; and other holistic methods. Costly inputs 
  are not used at all or are kept to a minimum, and the system is flexible. In 
  addition, these methods restore and maintain carbon levels in the soil. Hence, 
  if practised on a large scale, they could transform soils from carbon sources 
  into carbon sinks.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency improvements and energy conservation are other issues of 
  economic and strategic concern. In developing countries, energy demand (for 
  electricity in particular) continues to grow at a rate that is often hard to 
  keep up with. The adoption of environmentally sound technologies (ESTs) for 
  both energy production and energy consumption would enable these countries to 
  lower the pressure on energy investments, reduce public investments (in some 
  cases by up to one-third (World Bank, 1994)), improve export competitiveness, 
  enlarge energy reserves, and also avoid a large increase in GHG emissions. Thus 
  the alternative energy paths of low-carbon futures in developing countries can 
  be compatible with national objectives. Such paths could prevent energy and/or 
  GDP intensities from following the growth path of the developed world, in which 
  energy demand and GDP elasticity first increased with successive stages of industrialization, 
  but since have sharply decreased.</p>
<p>A large number of similar synergy effects can be found in industry, transportation, 
  and human settlement patterns. For example, more decentralized development patterns 
  based on a stronger role for small- and medium-sized cities can decrease the 
  rural exodus, reduce needs for transportation, and allow the use of modern technologies 
  (biotechnology, solar energy, wind, and small-scale hydropower) to tap the large 
  reserves of natural resources. Building upon the lending experiences of World 
  Bank operations and sector programmes in a number of countries, Warford <i>et al</i>. 
  (1996) provide evidence for the positive linkages between economic policies 
  and the environment. Although environmental concerns, and climate change issues 
  in particular, were not explicitly addressed by macroeconomic and sectoral policies, 
  the country cases analyzed show clear synergies between reform policies and 
  environmental improvements. In some cases when adverse side effects do occur, 
  the remedy is not to reverse the reform policies, but rather to introduce specific 
  complementary measures that address the negative effects.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to underline that for the elements that constitute 
  policies at different levels to operate in a mutually reinforcing manner, the 
  creation of appropriate communication and information channels should be given 
  special attention. The topic of establishing effective and stable flows of communication 
  among different stakeholders is seldom addressed in connection with climate 
  change mitigation. This is mainly because policies related to climate change 
  tend to treat mitigation options as isolated projects, each falling into a narrow 
  area in which potential synergies may be ignored or misunderstood. As result, 
  environmental policies risk resulting poorly structured interventions, with 
  a limited scope of influence, and an overestimated cost-effectiveness (Eskeland 
  and Xie, 1998). Greater synergies could be achieved if agencies with global 
  and local agendas did business together, through effective linkage mechanisms 
  that allow co-ordination and support in implementing tasks or functions that 
  belong to different subsystems and involve different actors.</p>
