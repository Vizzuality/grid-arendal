<h4>3.6.4.3 Energy Cropping</h4>
<p>Other than traditional forest crops (see <a href="155.htm">Chapter 4</a>), 
  a number of annual and perennial species have been identified as having high 
  efficiency properties when converting solar energy into stored biomass which 
  can then be converted into heat, electricity or transport fuels with zero or 
  very low carbon emissions (Veenendal <i>et al</i>., 1997). (Conversion of biomass is 
  described in <a href="131.htm">Section 3.8.4.3.2</a> and biofuels for transport 
  in <a href="100.htm#344">Section 3.4.4</a>).</p>
<p>High yielding short rotation forest crops or C4 plants (e.g., sugar cane and 
  sorghum) can give stored energy equivalents of over 400 GJ/ha/yr at the commercial 
  scale, leading to very positive input/output energy balances of the overall 
  system (El Bassam, 1996). Ethanol production from maize and other cereals in 
  the USA, from sugar cane in Brazil, and biodiesel from oilseed rape in Europe, 
  are being commercially produced but are subject to commodity price fluctuations 
  and government support. The relatively low energy yields per hectare for many 
  oil crops (around 60 to 80GJ/ha/yr for oil) compared with crops grown for cellulose 
  or starch/sugar (200&#150;300GJ/ha/yr), has led to the US National Research 
  Council advising against any further research investment (NRC, 1999b). </p>
<p>Liquid biofuels (see <a href="102.htm#3446">Section 3.4.4.6</a>) when substituted 
  for fossil fuels will directly reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Therefore, a 
  combination of bioenergy production with carbon sink options can result in maximum 
  benefit from mitigation strategies. This can be achieved by planting energy 
  crops such as short rotation coppice into arable or pasture land, which increases 
  the carbon density of that land, while also yielding a source of biomass. Converting 
  the accumulated carbon in the biofuels for energy purposes, and hence recycling 
  it, alleviates the critical issue of maintaining the biotic carbon stocks over 
  time as for a forest sink. Increased levels of soil carbon may also result from 
  growing perennial energy crops (IEA Bioenergy, 1999), but a detailed life cycle 
  assessment is warranted for specific crops and regions. </p>
<p>Land needed to grow energy crops competes directly with food and fibre production 
  unless grown on marginal or degraded land, or unless surplus land is available. 
  For the USA and Europe. Hall and Scrase (1998) calculated there to be sufficient 
  land physically available to grow crops to supply all human needs of food, fibre, 
  and energy at current population levels, though the study did not include social, 
  economic, and logistical constraints. Sufficient labour, water, and nutrients 
  must also be available if a sustainable and economic bioenergy industry is to 
  be developed. On marginal lands, such as the increasingly saline soils of Australia, 
  growing short rotation eucalyptus in strips between blocks of cereal crops can 
  help lower the water table and hence, under certain circumstances, reduce the 
  soil saline levels to bring back the natural fertility. However, water demands 
  can be high for short rotation forest crops so the resulting overall effects 
  are yet to be determined. An additional benefit is that the decentralization 
  of energy production using energy crops to supply local conversion plants creates 
  employment in rural areas (Grassi, 1998; El Bassam <i>et al</i>., 1998; Moreira and 
  Goldemberg, 1999).</p>
<p>Certain woody crops and also perennial grasses grown to produce biomass have 
  theoretically high dry matter yields, but commercial yields are often lower 
  than expected from those produced in small plot research trials. In Sweden, 
  for example, where 16,000 ha of coppice Salix species have been planted, around 
  2000ha were harvested for the first time during the winters of 1996 to 1998 
  to yield only 4.2 oven dry t/ha/yr on average (Larsson <i>et al</i>., 1998). With better 
  management, genetic selection, and grower experience once viable markets for 
  the product are established, it had been anticipated that commercial yields 
  closer to 10 oven dry t/ha/yr would result.</p>
<p>Correct species selection to meet specific soil and climatic site conditions 
  is necessary in order to maximize yields in terms of MJ/ha/yr (Sims <i>et al</i>., 
  1999). For example, the saccharose yield of Brazilian sugar cane has increased 
  10% to 143kg/t of fresh cane (70% moisture content wet basis) since 1990. Methods 
  of identifying appropriate species based on non-destructive yield measurements 
  and species fuelwood characteristics have been developed (Senelwa and Sims, 
  1998). Energy balance ratios for each unit of energy input required to produce 
  solid fuels from short rotation forest crops are up to 1: 30, and can be even 
  higher when crop residues are also utilized (Scholz, 1998). Woody crops normally 
  require less energy inputs per hectare than food crops.</p>
<p>Forest sinks are covered in <a href="155.htm">Chapter 4</a> and also in the 
  Special Report on<i> Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry </i>(IPCC, 2000), 
  but there is a link between these low cost sinks and eventually using some of 
  the biomass grown for energy purposes. Once the limited area of available land 
  is covered in forest sinks, no more planting will be possible and recycling 
  of the carbon to displace fossil fuels may then become feasible. Economic mechanisms 
  to link a forest sink project with a biofuel project have been suggested (Read, 
  1999).</p>

<h4>3.6.4.4 Crop and Animal Wastes</h4>
<p>Crop residues such as straw, bagasse, and rice husks, if not returned to the 
  land for nutrient replenishment and soil conditioning, could be used more in 
  the future for heat and power generation, at times in co-combustion with coal, 
  and in appropriate conversion equipment now that the technology is well proven. 
  Wood residues used in small-scale biomass gasifiers will become reliable and 
  more cost effective in time, but at present have some operational risk attached, 
  particularly under developing country conditions (Senelwa and Sims, 1999). </p>
<p>Animal manures and industrial organic wastes are currently used to generate 
  biogas. For example, in Denmark there are 19 decentralized community scale biogas 
  plants for electricity generation (Nielsen <i>et al</i>., 1998). Biogas can also be 
  used for cogeneration, direct heating or as a transport fuel.</p>

<h4>3.6.4.5 Behavioural Changes </h4>
<p>Many farmers in both developed and developing countries will remain unlikely 
  to change their traditional production methods in the short term unless there 
  are clear financial incentives to do so. Behavioural changes as a result of 
  advisors educating members of farming communities to adopt new measures have 
  rarely succeeded to date. Cultural factors have a strong influence on the general 
  unwillingness to accept inappropriate development and hence new ideas. Changing 
  attitudes are unlikely to occur unless farmers can also perceive personal co-benefits 
  such as increased profitability, time saving, cost reductions, improved animal 
  health, increased soil fertility, and less arduous tasks. Regulations in some 
  form are the alternative (OECD, 1998a) but would probably be difficult to monitor, 
  particularly in developing countries. Education of local extension officers 
  is needed to encourage the uptake of new methods and more rapid implementation 
  into the field. These barriers are discussed in <a href="215.htm">Section 
  5.4.5</a>.</p>
<p>Dietary changes from meat to fish or vegetables could help reduce emissions 
  by 55MtC<sub>eq</sub> in Europe alone (Gielen <i>et al</i>, 1999) and possibly release land for 
  energy cropping.</p>
