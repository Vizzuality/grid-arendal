<h2>6.5 Key Considerations </h2>
<p>This section deals with the most important aspects that could be considered 
  in designing climate change policy.</p>
<h3><a name="651"></a>6.5.1 Price versus Quantity Instruments</h3>
<p>Optimal climate change policy&#150;irrespective of whether it is national or 
  international&#150;under uncertainty and/or asymmetric information deviates 
  from more typical analyses with best-guess parameter values and/or information 
  symmetry, not only in terms of the stringency of policies, but also in terms 
  of policy design (Weitzman, 1974). Depending on the degree of uncertainty and 
  correlation between the marginal damage and MAC curves, taxes could be a better 
  or inferior alternative to tradable permits (Watson and Ridker, 1984; Stavins, 
  1996).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#104","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>104</sup></small></a> 
  Recent literature shows that taxes dominate quotas for the control of GHGs when 
  the environmental damage function is rather flat (Hoel and Karp, 1998). Hoel 
  (1998) and Pizer (1997b) point out that the lack of a clear, short-term threshold 
  for severe climate damages favours the use of market-based policies, like taxes, 
  that limit cost uncertainty. In addition, there is mounting evidence that rigid 
  emission limits are not appropriate in the short run under a weak emissions 
  reduction regime (Newell and Pizer, 1998).</p>
<p>Recently, Pizer (1997a) argued that excluding uncertainty might lead to policy 
  recommendations that are too lax. Ebert (1996) has argued that improving the 
  information of the regulator is crucial, because decision makers always overestimate 
  abatement costs if they neglect that firms possess an abatement option other 
  than decreasing output&#150;additional abatement technology.</p>
<p>To increase the effectiveness and efficiency of domestic GHG emissions reduction 
  policies, it is argued that governments could adopt policies that take a comprehensive 
  approach, stimulating the development of all kinds of new materials, materials 
  substitution, product re-design, resource productivity, and waste management 
  strategies that can reduce GHG emissions. Moreover, governments could set long-term 
  GHG emissions reduction targets, since the optimal set of technical options 
  at low GHG mitigation levels may not include options that are efficient at high 
  GHG emissions reduction levels.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="652"></a>6.5.2 Interactions of Policy Instruments with Fiscal Systems</h3>
<p>It is important to consider how the domestic policy instruments examined in 
  this chapter may interact with existing fiscal systems, because such interactions 
  can have significant effects on the overall costs of achieving specified GHG 
  emissions reduction targets. A growing literature demonstrates theoretically, 
  and with numerical simulation models, that the costs of addressing GHG targets 
  with policy instruments of all kinds&#150;command-and-control as well as market-based 
  approaches&#150;can be greater than anticipated because of the interaction of 
  these policy instruments with existing domestic tax systems.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#105","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>105</sup></small></a> 
  Domestic taxes on labour and investment income change the economic returns to 
  labour and capital, and distort the efficient use of these resources.</p>
<p>The cost-increasing interaction reflects the impact that GHG policies can have 
  on the functioning of labour and capital markets through their effects on real 
  wages and the real return to capital (see, e.g., Parry <i>et al</i>., 1999). By restricting 
  the allowable GHG emissions, permits, regulations, or a carbon tax raise the 
  costs of production and the price of output, thus reducing the real return to 
  labour and capital, and exacerbating prior distortions in the labour and capital 
  markets. Thus, to attain a given GHG emissions target, before or after use of 
  IET and other Kyoto mechanisms, all the instruments have a cost-increasing &#147;interaction 
  effect&#148;.</p>
<p>For policies that raise revenue for the government, carbon taxes and auctioned 
  permits, this is only part of the story, however. These revenues can be recycled 
  to reduce existing distortionary taxes. Thus, to attain a given GHG emissions 
  target, revenue-generating policy instruments have the advantage of a potential 
  cost-reducing &#147;revenue-recycling effect&#148; as compared to the alternative, 
  non-auctioned tradable permits or other non-revenue-generating instruments (Bohm, 
  1998). For a more complete theoretical discussion, see <a href="266.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>, and see <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> for the empirical results.</p>
