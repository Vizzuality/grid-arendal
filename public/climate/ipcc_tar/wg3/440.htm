<p><i>Technological Change</i><br>
  In the debate on weaker versus stronger early mitigation, the modelling of technological 
  change and the resultant costs of the available mitigation technologies at any 
  given time has far more influence when there is explicit consideration of damages 
  from climate change. Many models assume an exogenous aggregated trend parameter, 
  the rate of autonomous energy efficiency improvement. Other authors indicate 
  phenomena such as inertia, lock-in, and the diversity of factors that affect 
  the rate of technological development and diffusion. Energy technologies are 
  changing and improved versions of existing technologies are becoming available, 
  even without policy intervention. Modest early deployment of rapidly improving 
  technologies allows learning-curve cost reductions, without premature lock-in 
  to existing, low-productivity technology. Both the development of radically 
  advanced technologies require investment in basic research and incremental improvements 
  in existing technologies (e.g., learning by doing) is needed. Not only will 
  new energy-system technologies be required to stabilize concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  but also a host of peripheral technologies to distribute, maintain, transport, 
  and store new fuels. On the other hand, endogenous (market-induced) change could 
  accelerate development of low-cost solutions and induces an early switch of 
  corporate energy R&amp;D from fossil frontier developments to low carbon technologies. 
  <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> presents a discussion on induced technological 
  change. </p>
<p><i>Intergenerational Equity</i><br>
  Assuming that current GHG emissions are too high from a sustainability point 
  of view, it might be unfair of the current generation to decide to take the 
  benefits related to emissions for themselves and that future generations should 
  carry the burden of reductions. This argument on intergenerational equity is 
  often emphasized to support early emission reduction.</p>
<p><i>Representation of Damages</i><br>
  An important implication of the debate on spiky versus smooth stabilization 
  paths<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#22","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>22</sup></small></a> 
  is that relatively high emissions in the near term, especially for higher stabilization 
  targets, may produce faster rates of climate change in the early 22<sup>nd</sup> 
  century. There is little reliable information on what kind and how much risk 
  this would pose to some ecosystems and socioeconomic sectors. Nevertheless, 
  it should be kept in mind that paths towards the same ultimate environmental 
  objectives might involve different environmental impacts for several decades.</p>
<p>This line of research investigates whether the choice of emission paths that 
  lead to the same concentration target makes a difference in damages. In nearly 
  all IAMs, climate damages depend on the magnitude of temperature change, but 
  not on its rate. Experts point out that, because of the difficulties or higher 
  costs of adaptation in some impact sectors, net damages could be higher for 
  a relatively faster climate change. Moreover, some large-scale geophysical systems, 
  like ocean circulation, may also be sensitive to the rate of temperature change 
  (see IPCC, 2001a). To explore the former issue, Tol (1996; 1998a) used the Climate 
  Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiations and Distribution (FUND) model for different 
  damage functions and conducted an extensive sensitivity analysis with respect 
  to the discounting rate, the power of the damage function, the optimal temperature 
  for the level variant, and memory of damages in the rate variant. The results 
  are ambiguous, but the flat path (early mitigation) is preferable in a significantly 
  larger number of cases. This entails, for example, early reductions for discount 
  rates of 0% and 3%, but not for 10%. If the optimal temperature increase exceeds 
  pre-industrial levels by 3&deg;C, early reduction is not required. Tol finds 
  that impact costs for the spiky path are typically less than 20% higher than 
  those of the smooth path. However, the differences are larger when impact costs 
  also depend on the rate of change, when the exponent of the damage function 
  is higher, and when the rate variant includes memory of damages.</p>
<p><i>Uncertainty with Respect to the Stabilization Target</i><br>
  Looking beyond the question of optimizing the emission path towards a specific 
  concentration level, the main problem is that we do not know today what will 
  be the desirable stabilization target. This kind of uncertainty, the expectation 
  that it will be resolved over time, and the sequential nature of making mitigation 
  decisions supports the arguments for timing mitigation actions in a context 
  of uncertainty, raising various issues including that of inertia. From this 
  perspective, it may be wise to prepare the ground now for possibly deep and 
  fast emission reductions if resolution of the uncertainties would indicate that 
  drastic climate protection measures are necessary, rather than rush towards 
  an uncertain target now by taking an expensive path.</p>
<p>Some models focus on the problem of near-term mitigation measures under long-term 
  uncertain concentration targets, when the capital stock is inert. In these models, 
  the equation for mitigation costs incorporates&#151;beside the common permanent 
  costs&#151;an additional term to represent the transition costs, which are indicators 
  for the inertia of the system. The costs in this field are typically calculated 
  by comparing paths of immediate and of delayed reduction (usually 20 years). 
  The latter is an approximation to the spiky path. In models that incorporate 
  only one production sector, costs depend on the inertia of the system, the delay 
  of reduction measures, and the concentration targets. For a concentration target 
  of 450ppmv, mitigation costs may rise by 70% if the inertia is high (50 years 
  characteristic time), compared to the lower (20 years) inertia of an increase 
  by 25%&#150;32%. The transition costs are more important than the permanent 
  costs until 2050, with a maximum of 1.4% of Gross World Product (GWP) in 2040 
  and decline to zero until 2070. With respect to uncertain concentration targets, 
  the results are most sensitive to inertia. Emissions reduction are double those 
  of corresponding cases with a certain concentration target; for example, 9%&#150;14% 
  compared to 3%&#150;7% in 2020 under a 550ppmv concentration goal (Ha-Duong 
  <i>et al</i>., 1997; see also Grubb <i>et al</i>., 1995; Grubb, 1997). In a sectorally disaggregated 
  model with two sectors of different inertias, the abatement levels are roughly 
  the same, but the cost burden lies primarily in the more flexible sector. The 
  costs are higher and the differences are more distinctive in the delayed cases 
  compared to the immediate control cases. The sensitivity decreases with the 
  concentration target. Analysts, however, warn that such models and results are 
  still preliminary.</p>
<p><i>Possibilities to Reduce Near-term Costs</i><br>
  <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> discusses various possibilities to capture low-cost 
  options, such as revenue recycling, integration of climate with non-climate 
  policies to achieve ancillary benefits, and the availability of no regrets options. 
  Such possibilities would be in favour of near term actions. For example, revenue 
  recycling has been proposed as one instrument to reduce the costs of, and thus 
  in support, of near-term emission reductions. In addition to the environmental 
  considerations, this argument relates to the numerous distortions from taxes 
  and subsidies in virtually all countries. Economy-wide effects of carbon taxes, 
  and especially the double-dividend issue, are highly debated. Much enthusiasm 
  has been given to &#147;green taxes&#148;, such as the carbon tax, which might 
  reduce the inefficiency of the current tax systems and lead to environmental 
  improvements. Recent analyses show that the ultimate fiscal effect of substituting 
  carbon taxes for other distortionary taxes is roughly neutral (Nordhaus, 1998), 
  but the actual sign depends on the original size of the distortions in the economy. 
  It may be positive in economies with highly distorted tax systems and hence 
  confirm the double dividend hypothesis (see <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a>). 
  It is likely to be negative in economies with less pre-existing distortions. 
  In either case, revenue-recycling policies dominate other measures considerably. 
  Goulder (1995) and others report about 30%&#150;50% reductions in the cost of 
  regulation, and many European studies find cost reductions over 100%.</p>
