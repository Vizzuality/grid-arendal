<h3>8.4.3 Economywide Impact of CO<sub>2</sub> Stabilization in the Post-SRES 
  Scenarios</h3>
<p>The economy-wide impact of stabilizing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  was assessed based on 42 post-SRES stabilization scenarios developed using the 
  AIM, ASF, MARIA, MiniCAM, MESSAGE, and World SCAN models. These scenarios were 
  developed by applying various mitigation policies and measures to the six illustrative 
  scenarios (baselines) presented in the Special Report on Emission Scenarios 
  (SRES).<a name="fig8-16"></a><a name="fig8-17"></a></p>

<p>The economy-wide impact of CO<sub>2</sub> stabilization was assessed on the 
  basis of the difference in GDP in baseline scenarios and corresponding stabilization 
  cases in a given year. This difference is expressed in percent (reflecting a 
  relative GDP loss) and is positive when GDP in a baseline scenario is larger 
  than in a stabilization case and is negative when GDP in a stabilization scenario 
  is larger. Such an approach to measuring effects of stabilization was selected 
  since it better reflects the societal burden of emission stabilization than 
  absolute changes in GDP. For example, a 1% reduction in the 2100 GDP of the 
  SRES A1 world is equal to about US$5.5 trillion and is larger in absolute terms 
  than a 2% or US$5.0 trillion reduction in the 2100 GDP of the poor A2 world. 
  Nonetheless, the relative level of effort in the latter case would be much greater. 
  It should be also emphasized here that the GDP reduction itself represents a 
  very crude indicator of economic consequences of the CO<sub>2</sub> stabilization. 
  For example, most of the stabilization scenarios reviewed here have not rigorously 
  accounted for the economic effects of introducing new low-emission technologies, 
  new revenue rising instruments or adequate inter-regional financial and technology 
  transfers, all elements which contribute to lower the costs as explained in 
  the rest of the chapter.</p>

<p><a name="fig8-18"></a>The average GDP reduction in most of the stabilization 
  scenarios reviewed here is under 3% of the baseline value (the maximum reduction 
  across all the stabilization scenarios reached 6.1% in a given year). At the 
  same time, some scenarios (especially in the A1T group) showed an increase in 
  GDP compared to the baseline due to apparent positive economic feedbacks of 
  technology development and transfer. The GDP reduction (averaged across storylines 
  and stabilization levels) is lowest in 2020 (0.99%), reaches a maximum in 2050 
  (1.45%) and declines by 2100 (1.30%). However, in the scenario groups with the 
  highest baseline emissions (A2 and A1FI), the size of the GDP reduction increases 
  throughout the modelling period.</p>
<p>Due to their relatively small scale when compared to absolute GDP levels, GDP 
  reductions in the post-SRES stabilization scenarios do not lead to significant 
  declines in GDP growth rates over this century. For example, the annual 1990-2100 
  GDP growth rate across all the stabilization scenarios was reduced on average 
  by only 0.003% per year, with a maximum reduction reaching 0.06% per year.</p>
<p><a href="#fig8-18">Figure 8.18</a> shows the relationship between the relative 
  GDP reduction, the scenario group, and the stabilization level in 2050. The 
  reduction in GDP tends to increase with the stringency of the stabilization 
  target. But the costs are very sensitive to the choice of baseline scenario. 
  The maximum relative reduction occurs in the A1FI scenario group, followed by 
  the other A1 scenario groups and the A2 group, while the minimum reduction occurs 
  in the B1 group<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn8.htm#20","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>20</sup></small></a> 
  . By 2100, the situation slightly changes with GDP reductions in the A2 scenario 
  group becoming relatively more pronounced.</p>

<div align="left"> 
  <p>Differences in relative GDP reductions in different scenario groups are explained 
    by the magnitude of corresponding CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions needed 
    to achieve a particular stabilization level. The emission reduction is apparently 
    the largest in the A1FI scenario group, which is also associated with the 
    largest GDP loss (<a href="#fig8-19">Figure 8.19</a>). Meanwhile, the smallest 
    relative GDP loss occurs in the A1T and B1 groups, which have low baseline 
    emissions and accordingly require the smallest reductions to reach the CO<sub>2</sub> 
    stabilization.</p>
  <p>Regional GDP reduction patterns in the post-SRES stabilization scenarios 
    are also generally explained by corresponding required reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> 
    emissions, which are determined by baseline emissions, the stabilization levels, 
    assumptions about emissions trading mechanisms and about the relative contribution 
    of regions to global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; reduction and associated financial 
    and technology transfer. In most of the baseline (SRES) scenarios starting 
    from 2020, absolute CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in developing (non-Annex I) regions 
    remain larger for the rest of the 21st century than in the industrialized 
    (Annex I) regions.</p>
