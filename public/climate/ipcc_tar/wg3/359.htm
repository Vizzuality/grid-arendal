<h3>9.2.2 Coal</h3>
<p>Coal remains one of the major global and long-term energy resources and is 
  likely to continue being so as long as economically exploitable reserves are 
  widely available. Though its relative importance has declined in industrialized 
  countries during the last century, mainly as a result of the advent of oil and 
  gas, 36% of world electricity is generated from coal and 70% of world steel 
  is produced using coal and coke. Global hard coal production in 1998 was about 
  3,750Mt, mostly used to generate electricity, with reserves estimated at in 
  excess of 1000 billion tonnes (WCI, 1999; IEA, 1998b, 1999). The dependence 
  on coal use in electricity generation in developing countries is expected to 
  continue. Depending on the efficiency of this power generation and the degree 
  of substitution for direct coal combustion, fuel substitution can assist in 
  reducing GHG emissions, for example when electrification reduces coal use by 
  households (see Held <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1996; Shackleton <i><i>et al</i></i>., 
  1996; and Lennon <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1994 for a discussion of the South African 
  electrification programme). </p>
<p>The Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (Nakicenovic <i><i>et al</i></i>., 
  2000) suggests that there is a very large range in the global primary energy 
  demand expected to come from coal even in the absence of additional climate 
  change policy initiatives. For example, in 2100, scenario A2 has a coal demand 
  of some 900EJ, but scenario B1 has only 44EJ (the 1990 level is estimated to 
  be 85-100EJ).</p>
<p>GHG mitigation is expected to lead to a decline in coal output relative to 
  a reference case, especially in Annex B countries. Indeed the process may have 
  already started; recent trends in coal consumption indicate a 4% reduction in 
  OECD countries and a 12.5% increase in the rest of the world in 1997 versus 
  1987 (WCI, 1999). The process may lead to higher costs, especially if the change 
  is rapid, but there are also substantial ancillary benefits. <a href="089.htm">Chapter 
  3</a> discusses the wide variety of mitigation options that exist for the production 
  and use of coal. These involve reducing emissions directly from the coal mining 
  process, replacing coal with other energy sources or reducing coal utilization 
  (directly through efficiency of coal combustion or indirectly via the more efficient 
  use of secondary energy supplies).</p>
<p>Some of the options detailed in <a href="089.htm">Chapter 3</a> could represent 
  a &#147;win-win&#148; situation for GHG mitigation and the coal sector. For 
  example, GHG mitigation can be achieved by reducing the coal sector&#146;s own 
  energy consumption, beneficiation and coal-bed CH<sub>4</sub> recovery, whilst 
  maintaining coal production. Other options have clear, but often non-quantifiable, 
  costs and/or ancillary benefits attached to them. The study Asia least-cost 
  GHG abatement strategy (ALGAS)-India (ADB-GEF-UNDP, 1998a) reports that Indian 
  CO<sub>2 </sub>abatement would be primarily achieved by fuel switching and, 
  to some extent, by a shift to more expensive but more efficient technologies. 
  The most affected sector is coal as its consumption is modelled to decrease 
  in power generation, followed by the industrial and residential sectors. The 
  study concludes that this could lead to a significant reduction in labour employment 
  in the coal sector. For China, using a dynamic linear programming model, Rose 
  <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1996) find that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions may be reduced substantially 
  by conserving energy and switching away from coal, without hindering future 
  economic development.</p>
<h4><a name="9221"></a>9.2.2.1 Costs for the Coal Sector of Mitigation Options</h4>
<p>Apart from the direct loss of output there are numerous other costs for the 
  coal sector associated with mitigation. These costs relate mainly to the impact 
  of the long-term reduction in coal consumption and hence coal production. In 
  the short to medium term, these impacts will be moderate as global coal consumption 
  is anticipated to continue to increase, albeit at a lower rate. Whilst limited 
  work has been undertaken in this area, macro impacts identified by the IEA (1997a 
  and 1999) and the WCI (1999) include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>educed economic activity in coal-producing countries owing to reduced coal 
    sales;</li>
  <li>ob losses in the coal mining, coal transport, and coal processing sectors 
    &#150; especially in developing countries with high employment per unit of 
    output;</li>
  <li>potential for the &#147;stranding&#148; of coal mining assets as well as 
    coal processing assets;</li>
  <li>closure of coal mines, which are very expensive to re-open;</li>
  <li>higher trade deficits caused by reductions in coal exports from developing 
    countries;</li>
  <li>reduction in national energy security resulting from an increased reliance 
    on imported energy sources where local energy options are primarily coal based;</li>
  <li>negative impacts of mine closure on communities where the mine is the major 
    employer; and</li>
  <li>possible slowdown of economic growth during the transition from coal to 
    other energy sources in countries with a heavy reliance on coal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kamat <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1999) modelled the impact of a carbon tax on the 
  economy of a geographically defined coal-based region, namely the Susquehanna 
  River Basin in the USA. Their results indicated that maintaining 1990 emissions 
  with a carbon tax of about US$17 per tonne of carbon could have a minor impact 
  on the economy as a whole, however, the negative impacts on the energy sector 
  could be considerable. In this regard the model indicates a decrease in total 
  output of the coal sector of approximately 58%. Exports are also severely affected 
  with resultant production cutbacks and job losses.</p>
<p>At the global level, Bartsch and M&uuml;ller (2000) report results that suggest 
  a significant reduction in the OECD&#146;s demand for coal under a Kyoto-style 
  scenario against a baseline scenario. Coal demand is modelled to fall by 4.4mtoe<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn9.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>3</sup></small></a> 
  per day from this baseline in 2010 and 2020. Knapp (2000) indicates a substantial 
  potential for relocation of the steel industry from Annex B countries to the 
  rest of the world as coal becomes more expensive. Whilst compromising overall 
  emission reduction objectives, this could be viewed as a positive equity contribution 
  with economic benefits for non-Annex B countries. Knapp also indicates that 
  the reduction in coal exports to Annex B countries for thermal power generation 
  will severely impact some coal-exporting countries. In particular Colombia, 
  Indonesia, and South Africa will incur substantial losses in export income with 
  attendant job and revenue losses. These costs might, to an extent, be reduced 
  through the use of the Kyoto CDM and technological innovation. The CDM might, 
  for example, be used to transfer highly efficient clean coal technology to non-Annex 
  B countries, as well as promote economic diversification to less energy-intensive 
  economic activity and the relocation of energy-intensive industries. To achieve 
  full benefits the latter would have to be accompanied by efficiency improvements 
  through the application of state of the art technology. </p>
<p>Pershing (2000) notes that internal economic growth could offset the negative 
  export impacts within 5 years for Colombia and Indonesia, but not for South 
  Africa. In this regard he reports that South Africa could feel the greatest 
  impacts of the major non-Annex B coal-exporting countries. In particular, he 
  forecasts revenue losses for Indonesia and South Africa as being as high as 
  1% and 4% of gross national product (GNP) respectively. Dunn (2000) reports 
  that the coal industry has been shedding jobs for several years now and this 
  trend is likely to continue in the coal industry as GHG mitigation actions take 
  effect. Pershing (2000), however, suggests that such impacts may not materialize 
  as a result of the implementation of the Climate Convention or Kyoto Protocol 
  commitments. For example, most projections are based on the use of macroeconomic 
  models - most of which do not take into account fossil fuel distribution effects 
  at the national level, or the use of CO<sub>2</sub> sinks or non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  GHG mitigation options. Pershing also suggests that some of these impacts may 
  be offset by other aspects of future energy and development paths. For example, 
  in a world in which climate change mitigation policies have been taken, investment 
  in non-conventional oil supply might be deferred - lowering the impacts on conventional 
  fuel exporters. </p>
<h4><a name="9222"></a>9.2.2.2 Ancillary benefits for Coal Production and Use 
  of Mitigation Options</h4>
The main ancillary benefits associated with reduction in coal burning, namely 
public health impacts, are considered in Chapter 8. However, there are also some 
ancillary benefits of mitigation directly affecting the coal industry. Mitigation 
could increase energy efficiency in coal utilization (Tunnah <i><i>et al</i></i>., 
1994; Li <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1995). The uptake of new, high efficiency, clean 
coal technologies (IEA, 1998b) could lead to enhanced skills levels and technological 
capacity in developing nations. Further benefits include increased productivity 
as a consequence of increased market pressures, as well as the extension of the 
life of coal reserves. The costs of adjustment will be much lower if policies 
for new coal production also encourage clean-coal technology. Mitigation also 
may favour coal production in non-Annex B countries as a result of the migration 
of energy-intensive industries to developing countries (carbon leakage), although 
estimates of the scale of such leakage are highly dependent on the assumptions 
made in the models (Bernstein and Pan, 2000). There are also potential benefits 
in enhancing research and development (R&amp;D) in the coal industry, especially 
in finding alternative and non-emitting applications for coal (IEA, 1999).<br>
