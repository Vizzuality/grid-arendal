<h4>9.2.10.4 Ancillary Benefits for Households<br>
</h4>
<p>A major ancillary benefit of GHG mitigation is reductions in the emissions 
  of local air pollutants. Glomsro <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1990) have indicated that improved 
  health conditions as a consequence of improved air quality, etc., could offset 
  roughly two-thirds of the calculated GDP loss arising out of policies to reduce 
  emissions. Alfsen <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1995) indicate a 6 to 10% reduction in SO<sub>2</sub> 
  and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions by the year 2000 as a result of an energy tax of 
  US$3/barrel in 1993 and increasing by US$1 in each subsequent year to 2000.</p>
<p>Transport sector mitigation could imply substantial price increases with associated 
  negative political, economic, and social implications, such as hardship for 
  low-income rural motorists without access to public transport (Koopman and Denis, 
  1995; Dargay and Gately, 1997). But the option of using public transport could 
  benefit the lower income sections of society, especially in developing countries, 
  along with associated reduction in emission of CO, NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> 
  (Bose and Srinivasachary, 1997). Lower fuel use by road transportation could 
  have substantial health benefits in urban areas (Pearce, 1996; Zaim, 1997). 
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of the indirect benefits of GHG mitigation of fuel switching and efficient 
  devices in the household sectors, typically in developing countries, include: 
  <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>improved indoor air quality;</li>
  <li>higher quality of life (simplifying household chores, better hygiene, and 
    easier cleaning);</li>
  <li>reduced fuel demand with economic and time-saving benefits to the household 
    (one study in Tanzania reported that women using wood as fuel spend 12 hours 
    a week to collect it (Gopalan and Saksena, 1999));</li>
  <li>increased sustainability of local natural resources; and </li>
  <li>reductions in the adverse effects of biomass use on human health (WHO, 1992).</li>
</ul>
<p>These points are particularly relevant in the case of biomass-burning stoves 
  (Sathaye and Tyler, 1991; Smith 1996). Gopalan and Saksena (1999) report that 
  the level of exposure to key pollutants in rural households can be 10 to 100 
  times higher than the health-related guidelines of the WHO. <br>
</p>
<p>The results of a study on potential fuelwood use in 2020 for Austria, Finland, 
  France, Portugal, and Sweden reveal that upstream emissions from fuel extraction 
  are generally higher for fossil fuels than biofuels (Schwaiger and Schlamadinger, 
  1998). However, some research indicates that local negative environmental implications 
  may be greater for use of wood than fossil fuel (Radetzki, 1997). An associated 
  impact of increased diversion of land for growing wood would be on agriculture 
  production and hence the commodity prices (Alig <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1997). The economic 
  benefits of afforestation also include benefits from increase in supply of non-timber 
  forest products (Mors, 1991; ADB-GEF-UNDP, 1998a). These options in developing 
  countries would greatly increase the wood supply and address the forest degradation 
  issue but viability is an important issue as incomes are too low in rural areas 
  for sizeable numbers of the population to buy wood. <br>
</p>
<p>Mitigation strategies in rural domestic energy use range from use of more efficient 
  appliances, installation of PV solar, fuel-switching and use of bio-gas (ADB-GEF-UNDP, 
  1998a). Such strategies for developing countries are constrained by high capital 
  costs (Biswas and Lucas, 1997). The ancillary benefits of lower use of traditional 
  biomass are decreased deforestation, and lower loss of crop-nutrient from the 
  system through use of agricultural residue as fuel (Bala, 1997). The ancillary 
  environmental benefits that are associated with such strategies do not form 
  a major factor in energy decisions of the household (Aacher and Kammen, 1996); 
  it is the cost that is the important factor. And some mitigation measures at 
  home, such as reduction of air leaks, tend to worsen indoor air quality (Turiel, 
  1985).<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="92105"></a>9.2.10.5 The Asia Least-cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement 
  Strategy Studies </h4>
<p>ALGAS was a regional technical assistance project of the Asian Development 
  Bank (ADB) which enabled 12 Asian countries: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>to prepare an inventory of anthropogenic emissions and sinks of GHGs;</li>
  <li>to evaluate the costs and effectiveness of measures available to reduce 
    GHG emissions or enhance sinks; and </li>
  <li>to develop national action plan policy responses that will be required to 
    implement the measures that are identified. </li>
</ul>
<p>The ALGAS country reports highlight the forestry sector options: forest protection 
  and reforestation will have both socio-economic benefits and environmental benefits. 
  These forestry options will increase rural incomes, increase equity of income, 
  and increase the availability of biomass (ADB-GEF-UNDP, 1998b, c, d and f). 
  These studies also emphasize that the forestry options would reduce the pressure 
  on forested land and have indirect benefits of reducing soil erosion in hilly 
  terrain. However, some of the studies (ADB-GEF-UNDP 1998c and e) indicate that 
  these changes are short term and do not have a significant effect.<br>
</p>
<p>The ALGAS-Bangladesh (ADB-GEF-UNDP, 1998d) study also reports that the options 
  in the agricultural sector of reducing CH4 emission from paddy fields and enteric 
  fermentation in animals have direct benefits in terms of increased incomes, 
  and also improve foodgrain production and availability. <br>
