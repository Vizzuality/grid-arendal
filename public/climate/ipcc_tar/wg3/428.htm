<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>Over recent years a good deal of analytical work has addressed the problem 
  in both directions. Various approaches have been explored to transcend the limits 
  of the standard views of rationality in dealing with issues of uncertainty, 
  complexity, and the contextual influences of human valuation and decision making. 
  Jaeger <i>et al</i>. (1998) provide a useful discussion on the various attempts to 
  create new interfaces between scientific rationality and a pluralistic society. 
  As these authors remark, &#147;a common theme emerges: the emphasis on cultural 
  and social realities, which cannot be reduced to individual choices.&#148; Now, 
  it is recognized that sustainable development and climate change deal not only 
  with complex and poorly defined goals, but also that the values at stake are 
  plural and conflicting, and even the very nature of each problem is successively 
  transformed in the course of exploration. Problems are no longer seen as external 
  constraints to the social progress, but as issues inherent to the structure 
  itself of societies, so even the idea itself of finding a solution no longer 
  applies, since problems are not solved but managed (Tognetti, 1999). Therefore, 
  the process of integrating and internalizing climate change and sustainable 
  development into national agendas requires new problem-solving strategies in 
  which decision making takes on a new complexion. It becomes a task of finding 
  a partially undiscovered landscape rather than charting a scientific course 
  to an end point. Decisions must be made about which of the systemic possibilities 
  to promote and which to discourage, how to deal with uncertainties, and what 
  risks to take considering irreversible changes and potential bifurcation points. 
  These decisions must be informed by science, but in the end they are an expression 
  of human ethics and preferences, and of the sociopolitical context in which 
  they are made (Kay <i>et al</i>., 1999).</p>
<p>In a seminal work, Funtowicz and Ravetz (1993, 1994) provide a fruitful approach 
  to problem-solving and decision-making strategies in terms of uncertainties 
  in knowledge and complexities in ethics. Contrary to the traditional view that 
  science is value-free, these authors claim that in any real problem of environmental 
  management, scientific facts and sociopolitical values are inseparable dimensions. 
  According to the degree of both uncertainty and decision stakes, Funtowicz and 
  Ravetz distinguish three sorts of problem-solving strategies: applied science, 
  professional consultancy, and post-normal science.</p>
<p>When system uncertainties and decision stakes are both low, applied science 
  is able to manage problems by means of standard routines and procedures. Here, 
  problems are regarded as objective states that exist independently of values 
  and perceptions. The existence of one best solution is assumed, and the task 
  of analysts and decision makers is to work out the optimal strategies by searching 
  for the maximum utility among a number of options (Mintzberg, 1994). Since consensus 
  on the problem definition and values at stake are assumed, the proposed solutions 
  speak for themselves, and the implementation just requires their translation 
  from the technical language of scientists to the pragmatic language of policymakers.</p>
<p>Professional consultancy deals with problems for which uncertainties cannot 
  be managed at a technical level, because of the more complex aspects of the 
  problem and because the decision stakes are also more complex, involving both 
  stakeholders and natural systems. In response to the public demand for more 
  inclusive processes, problems are treated as risks, and if techniques and procedures 
  from the applied science are required, judgement becomes a key element in the 
  decision process.</p>
<p>A third sort of problem-solving strategy emerges when uncertainties are of 
  either an epistemological or ethical nature, or when the decision stakes reflect 
  conflicting purposes among stakeholders. In this case, the &#147;puzzle-solving 
  exercises of normal science&#148; are no longer applicable to the resolution 
  of policy issues of risks and the environment. What is required here is an approach 
  that allows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>management of irreducible uncertainties in knowledge and ethics;<br>
  </li>
  <li>plurality of different legitimate perspectives; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>extension of the peer community to all those with a stake in the dialogue 
    of the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the elements of an emerging type of problem-solving and decision 
  making known as post-normal science (Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1993).</p>
<p>The main contribution of post-normal science to policy analysis is to assert 
  that when science is applied to policy issues, it cannot provide certainty for 
  policy recommendations; and the conflicting values in any decision process cannot 
  be ignored, even in the problem-solving work itself (Jaeger <i>et al</i>., 1998; Rayner 
  and Malone, 1998b). The epistemological analysis of the approach shows that 
  the insertion of technocratic discourse into a broader social discourse and 
  participation is not only possible, but also necessary to improve the substantive 
  quality of decisions. At the practical level, the post-normal concept lays out 
  a DMF for articulating new institutional arrangements in which power sharing 
  between conventional decision-making agents and extended peer communities is 
  a key element (De Marchi and Ravetz, 1999; Healy, 1999). This is not merely 
  motivated by a &#147;democratic sentiment&#148;, but by the conviction that 
  the resultant decisions, although not necessarily economically the most efficient, 
  will turn out to be better decisions, judged by a broad range of competing social 
  criteria (Rayner and Malone, 2000).</p>
