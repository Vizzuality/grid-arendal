<h2>8.1 Introduction </h2>
<h3><a name="811"></a>8.1.1 Summary of Mitigation Cost Analysis in the Second 
  Assessment Report</h3>
<p>Chapters 8 and 9 of Second Assessment Report (SAR) (IPCC, 1996) reviewed the 
  literature on costs of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation prior to 1995. At that 
  period, the debate was dominated by the differences in results from &#147;bottom-up&#148; 
  (B-U) models and &#147;top-down&#148; (T-D) models. The former contain more 
  details of technology and physical flows of energy, and the latter give more 
  consideration to linkages between a given sector and a set of measures and macroeconomic 
  parameters like gross domestic product (GDP) and final household consumption.</p>
<p>B-U models showed that energy efficiency gains of 10%&#150;30% above baseline 
  trends could be realized at negative to zero net costs over the next two or 
  three decades. However, the costs of stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels reported 
  by T-D analysis for Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
  countries were less optimistic, in the range &#150;0.5% to 2% of GDP. SAR devoted 
  much effort to explain the reasons for these differences and their meaning for 
  policymakers. B-U models identify negative-cost mitigation potentials because 
  of the difference between the best available techniques and those currently 
  in use; the key question is then the extent to which market imperfections that 
  inhibit access to these potentials can be removed cost-effectively by policy 
  initiatives. T-D analyses focus on the overall macroeconomic effect of new incentive 
  structures, such as carbon taxes or subsidies for energy efficiency; their results 
  reflect a judgement on the capacity of non-price policies (market reforms, information, 
  capacity building) to enhance the effectiveness of such signals to decarbonize 
  the economy. The lesson is that, for a given abatement target, the content of 
  the policy mix (carbon tax, carbon-energy tax, or auctioned emissions trading 
  system) is as important as the assumptions regarding technology.</p>
<p>A second lesson of SAR is that, for both B-U and T-D models, the differences 
  in cost assessment usually result from differences in the definition of baseline 
  scenarios and in the time frame within which a given abatement target has to 
  be met. Less often, they result from divergences in the costs of achieving this 
  target from the same baseline scenario. This, in turn, relates to:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the structural features of the scenario (assumptions about population, the 
    rate and structure of economic growth, consumption patterns, and technology 
    development paths); and<br>
  </li>
  <li>its level of suboptimality (higher efficiency in the baseline scenario results 
    in higher mitigation-costs estimates for a given target, while the existence 
    of market failure, which enhances GHG emissions, or of fiscal distortions 
    provides a possibility for economic and environmental double dividends).</li>
</ul>
<p>The third lesson is that some of the determinants of costs are beyond the field 
  of energy and environmental policy <i>stricto sensu</i>. This is why SAR emphasizes 
  the importance of developing multiple baseline scenarios to support policymaking. 
  This issue of the multiplicity of baseline scenarios is specifically important 
  for the developing countries and countries with economies in transition. These 
  regions were underinvestigated compared with the number of studies available 
  for OECD countries. </p>
<h3><a name="812"></a>8.1.2 Progress since the Second Assessment Report</h3>
<p>Since SAR, the most important advance is the treatment of new topics related 
  to linkages between national policies and the international framework of these 
  policies in the context of the pre-Kyoto and post-Kyoto negotiation process. 
  Of specific interest is the articulation between international emissions trading 
  systems and domestic policies (taxes, domestic emissions trading, and standards). 
  This link has been made in national models and global models that provide a 
  description of relationships among various regions of the world. Some models 
  represent solely GHG emissions trading, while others also incorporate energy 
  flows, trade of other goods, and capital flows. In this context, while SAR discussed 
  only the carbon leakage between abating and non-abating economies, an increasing 
  number of studies have captured spillover effects (see <a href="321.htm#box81">Box 
  8.1</a>) such as those triggered by trade effects and the modification of the 
  capital flows.</p>
<div align="center"> </div>
<p>A second evolution is the emergence of studies on the local and regional ancillary 
  benefits of climate policies.<a name="box81"></a></p>

  <tr> 
    <td class="box"><b>Box. 8.1.</b> <i>Global Public Health Effects of Greenhouse 
      Gas Mitigation Policies </i> 
      <p>It is useful to estimate ancillary benefits through quantitative indicators, 
        even if they are not monetized (Pearce, 2000). One such global scale effort 
        was produced by the WHO/WRI/EPA Working Group on Public Health and Fossil 
        Fuel Combustion on the range of avoidable deaths that could arise between 
        2000 and 2020 under current policies, and under the scenario proposed 
        by the EU in 1995. This EU Scenario assumed that by 2010 GHG emissions 
        would be 15% below 1990 levels for Annex I countries, and 10% below projected 
        emissions for 2010 for non-Annex I countries (Davis, 1997; Working Group 
        on Public Health and Fossil Fuel Combustion, 1997). The total change in 
        carbon emissions was estimated globally, based on a source&#150;receptor 
        matrix for four specific sectors (industry, transport, household, and 
        energy) that was adjusted for local temperature and humidity. Applied 
        to nine regions and adjusted for temperature and humidity, this matrix 
        yielded changes in projected fuel types and formed the basis for calculating 
        total emissions of particulates. Mortality tied with particulates was 
        calculated based on best estimates (Borja-Aburto<i> et al.,</i> 1997, 
        1998; Pereira <i>et al.,</i> 1998; Gold <i>et al.,</i> 1999; Braga<i> 
        et al.,</i> 1999; Linn <i>et al., </i>2000).</p>
      <p>The report included a sensitivity analysis of the range of deaths, predicting 
        that by 2020, 700,000 avoidable deaths (90% Confidence Interval, 385,000&#150;1,034,000) 
        will occur annually as a result of additional particulate matter (PM) 
        exposure under the baseline forecasts when compared with the climate policy 
        scenario. From 2000 to 2020, the cumulative impact on public health related 
        to the difference in PM exposure could reach 8 million deaths globally 
        (90% CI, 4.4&#150;11.9 million). In the USA alone, the number of annual 
        deaths from PM exposure in 2020 (without control policy) would equal in 
        magnitude deaths associated with human immunodeficiency diseases or all 
        liver diseases in 1995. &#147;The mortality estimates are indicative of 
        the magnitude of the potential health benefits of the climate-policy scenario 
        examined and are not precise predictions of avoidable deaths. While characterized 
        by considerable uncertainty, the short-term public-health impacts of reduced 
        PM exposure associated with greenhouse-gas reductions are likely to be 
        substantial even under the most conservative set of assumptions.&#148;</p>
      <p>The framework for this assessment is described in more detail in Abt 
        Associates (1997); Pechan and Associates (1997).</p>

<p>The third evolution is the development of studies on various abatement pathways 
  towards given long-run concentration targets and on rules for emissions quota 
  allocation among countries. These approaches, more dynamic in nature, capture 
  the consequences of various abatement timetables on the behaviour of carbon 
  prices and on the sharing of the overall burden among countries. They provide 
  basic information about the equity of various designs of climate policies.</p>
<h3><a name="813"></a>8.1.3 Coverage </h3>
<p>This chapter covers studies on global assessments of the net cost of GHG mitigation 
  policies irrespective of the avoided costs of climate change: total mitigation 
  expenditure, and welfare gains or losses resulting from the economic feedbacks 
  of mitigation policies and from their environmental co-benefits.</p>
<p>A specific effort has been devoted to ensure a balanced representation of global 
  models and national models. Global models incorporate linkages between regions 
  and countries; they cannot, however, represent very precisely the specific characteristics 
  of each country, such as differences in national fiscal policies, in regional 
  arrangements, and in socioeconomic constraints. Results from these models are 
  widely diffused within the scientific community through publications in international 
  journals, but are less utilized by national policymakers. The second type of 
  study uses models the scope of which is limited to within the national frame. 
  Results of such studies are more frequently reported in local languages and 
  are more reflective of national debates and the specifics of the country in 
  question. They incorporate linkages with the rest of the world economy, although 
  in a more simplistic manner than the global models.</p>
<p>The results of these studies group into three large clusters. <a href="322.htm">Section 
  8.2</a> reviews the studies that entail near-to-mid term impacts of domestic 
  mitigation policies on factors such as GDP, welfare, income distribution, and 
  social and environmental co-benefits at the local and national levels. <a href="340.htm">Section 
  8.3</a> contains the results of mitigation studies that examine the interface 
  between these domestic policies and the international context: international 
  trade regimes, and spillover effects of the implementation of mitigation measures 
  by a country or a block of nations on other countries. <a href="346.htm">Section 
  8.4</a> reviews studies that focus on social, environmental, and economic impacts 
  of alternate pathways to meet a range of concentration stabilization pathways 
  beyond the Kyoto Protocol. They encompass a longer time horizon and do not incorporate 
  details of macro economic policies, but highlight the question of technological 
  change over the long run and the consequences of various sets of national targets.<br>
