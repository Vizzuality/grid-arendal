<h3><a name="124"></a>1.2.4 The Role of Uncertainty</h3>
<p>The uncertainties that surround climate change are vast. The connections between 
  emissions of GHGs and climate change are not fully understood. In addition, 
  uncertainty distorts our understanding of the impacts of climate change and 
  the value of those impacts to humans. These uncertainties depend on scale, and 
  become larger across the spectrum from &#147;average&#148; impacts across broadly 
  defined geographical areas to specific impacts felt at a more local level. </p>
<p>The uncertainties that surround climate change bear on the issue of whether 
  mitigation policies are justified. Some analysts might conclude that these uncertainties 
  justify the postponement of significant mitigation efforts&#150;particularly 
  those that involve economic sacrifices&#150;on the grounds that not enough is 
  yet known about the problem. Proponents of this point of view argue that there 
  is some chance that scientific inquiry will eventually reveal that the continued 
  accumulation of GHGs will not produce significant changes in climate and/or 
  significant associated damages. So long as the possibility exists that a &#147;type 
  one&#148; error (an action that will ultimately turn out to be unnecessary) 
  could occur, the argument goes, it is premature to undertake costly mitigation 
  measures now. </p>
<p>However, uncertainty also introduces the risk that the opposite will occur. 
  There is a significant possibility that scientific investigations will ultimately 
  reveal that the continued accumulation of GHGs will have severe consequences 
  for climate and substantial associated impacts. If this scenario should materialize, 
  the cost of making this &#147;type two&#148; error (of taking little or no action 
  in the near term to stem the accumulation of GHGs) could be enormous. As discussed 
  in <a href="319.htm">Chapters 8</a>-<a href="379.htm">10</a>, it may be less costly to spread 
  the costs of averting climate change by beginning mitigation efforts early, 
  rather than to wait several decades and take actions after the problem has already 
  advanced much further. Indeed, if postponing mitigation efforts allows irreversible 
  climate impacts to occur, then no future efforts, at any cost, can undo the 
  resultant damage.</p>
<p>The risks of premature (or unnecessary) action should therefore be compared 
  with the risks of failing to take action that later proves warranted. As stated 
  in Article 3.3 of the Framework Convention &#147;&#133;The 
  parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimise 
  the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects&#148;(UNFCCC, 
  1992). Which risk is larger? Analyses of this issue (see <a href="379.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>) tend to indicate that the latter risk is sufficient to justify some 
  mitigation efforts in the short run, despite the possibility that these efforts 
  might ultimately prove unnecessary. These analyses depict mitigation efforts 
  as a type of insurance against potentially serious future consequences. It is 
  generally sensible for a person to purchase fire insurance on his or her house 
  (despite the likelihood a fire will never occur). Likewise, it is rational for 
  nations to insure against potentially serious damages from climate change, despite 
  the significant chance that the most serious scenarios will not materialize.</p>
<p>The term precautionary principle has been employed to express the idea that 
  it may be appropriate to take actions to prevent potentially harmful climate-change 
  outcomes. As discussed in <a href="379.htm">Chapter 10</a>, this term has 
  more than one meaning. A weak version of the principle is the idea that, in 
  the presence of uncertainty, it may be prudent to engage in policies that provide 
  insurance against some of the potential damages from climate change. Insuring 
  against potentially serious damages can be rational simply because the costs 
  of the insurance are less than the expected value of avoided damages. This weaker 
  form of the precautionary principle applies even if individuals or societies 
  are not particularly averse to risk. In its stronger form, the precautionary 
  principle stipulates that nations should pursue whatever policies are necessary 
  to minimize the damages under the worst possible scenario. This stronger form 
  assumes extreme risk-aversion, since it focuses exclusively on the worst possible 
  outcomes. It is clear, though, that there are costs associated with climate 
  policies that could, under some circumstances, impose large costs on particular 
  peoples and/or nations; but neither form of the precautionary principle has 
  yet been applied to this side of the climate calculus.</p>
<p>Uncertainty also bears on the design of mitigation policies. As indicated in 
  <a href="319.htm">Chapters 8</a> and <a href="379.htm">10</a>, the problem 
  of climate change might be addressed most effectively through a process of sequential 
  decision making, in which policies are adjusted over time as new scientific 
  information becomes available and uncertainties are reduced. Moss and Schneider 
  (2000) offer guidance on how subjective probabilities can be utilized effectively 
  when empirical data are not available or are inconclusive. New information is 
  valuable, and flexible policies that can make use of this information have an 
  advantage over rigid ones that cannot. In any case, policies that help build 
  or strengthen mitigation capacity are consistent with the insurance approach. 
  To the extent that mitigation capacity is higher, the costs of future action 
  can be expected to be lower.</p>
