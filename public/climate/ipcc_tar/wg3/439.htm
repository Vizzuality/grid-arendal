<h3>10.4.3 When Should the Response Be Made? Factors Influencing the Relationships 
  between the Near-term and Long-term Mitigation Portfolio </h3>
<p>A broad range of mitigation responses can be conceived. However, the bulk of 
  attention, in both the analytical and policy arenas, has been devoted to reducing 
  the emission of GHGs from anthropogenic sources and to removing the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  (the most important GHG) already in the atmosphere by enhancing the biophysical 
  processes that capture it. The timing of these efforts depends partly on the 
  climatic constraints to be observed and on the costs of these actions, which 
  are subject to change over time. Even with an exact knowledge of the timing 
  and consequences of the future impacts of climate change, policymakers will 
  still be faced with difficult choices regarding the implementation of response 
  options. This is because the costs, availability, and associated impacts of 
  future mitigation options are uncertain, and the choices involve trade-offs 
  with important competing environmental and other social objectives. <a href="319.htm">Chapter 
  8</a> discusses the costs of different 
  pathways towards a fixed stabilization objective, and notes factors which would 
  favour a larger proportion of preparatory activities relative to mitigation 
  per se as well as factors that favour early mitigation. This section considers 
  the wider context relating to climate change risks and damages.</p>
<p><i>Inertia and Uncertainty </i><br>
  Various attempts have been made over the past few years to explore these questions. 
  Arguments that favour a larger fraction of preparatory activities (developing 
  technologies, building institutions, and the like), rather than emission reductions 
  in the near-term mitigation portfolio, include losses from the early retirement 
  of installed capital stock, technological development, the optimal allocation 
  of resources over time (discounting effect), and the carbon cycle premium (Wigley 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996). See <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> for a detailed discussion. 
  <a href="#tab107">Table 10.7</a> summarizes the most important arguments brought 
  forward in favour of modest and stringent emissions reduction in the near term.</p>

<p>In addition to those emphasized by Wigley <i>et al</i>. (1996; see above), other arguments 
  are proposed that support less stringent near-term emission reductions as well. 
  Most refer to the significant inertia in economic systems. The first argument 
  below is related to the economic lifetime of already installed capital stock. 
  The second points to the possibility of low-cost mitigation technologies becoming 
  available in the future.</p>
<p>Wigley <i>et al</i>. (1996) refer to the inertia of the capital stock. Researchers 
  also identified other fields of inertia such as technological developments and 
  lifestyles. The essential point of inertia in economic structures and processes 
  is that it incurs costs to deviate from it and these costs rise with the speed 
  of deviation. Such changes are often irreversible. The costs stem from premature 
  retirement of the capital stock, sectoral unemployment, switching cost of existing 
  capital, and rising prices of scarce investment goods. Emissions reduction in 
  the present influences the marginal abatement cost in the future. The inertia 
  of technological development arises from the path dependence. The capital stock 
  can be divided into three parts. First, end-use equipment with a relatively 
  short lifetime can be replaced within a few years. Second, infrastructure, buildings, 
  and production processes can be replaced in up to 50 years. Structures of urban 
  form and urban land-use can only be changed over 100 years. The demand and supply 
  of goods and services in these three domains are interrelated in a complex way 
  (Grubb <i>et al</i>., 1995; Grubb, 1997; Jaccard <i>et al</i>., 1997).</p>
