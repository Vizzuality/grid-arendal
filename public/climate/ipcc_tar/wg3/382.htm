<h2>10.1 Introduction </h2>
<h3><a name="1011"></a>10.1.1 Chapter Overview</h3>
<p>The preceding chapters in this volume assess the scientific literature on specific 
  aspects of climate change economics and policy. This chapter is intended to 
  synthesize the most important policy-relevant scientific results by taking several 
  cuts across the material. This chapter begins with a presentation of the special 
  features of climate change in the context of how they affect decision-making 
  in different frameworks. This is followed by a list of analytical frameworks 
  adopted by scientists to provide advice to decision makers and by an overview 
  of the most important new developments since the Second Assessment Report (SAR). 
  This section closes with notes on decision-making processes and implications 
  of uncertainty for the robustness of choices.</p>
<p><a href="396.htm">Section 10.2</a> presents an assessment of key insights from 
  the economics and political science literature into international regimes and 
  policy options. The chief issue addressed in the section is how international 
  institutions for addressing climate change, such as the United Nations Framework 
  Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), are simultaneously shaped by and influence 
  national policy choice.</p>
<p><a href="409.htm">Section 10.3</a> considers the problem of local and national 
  climate policy formulation in the broader context of sustainable development 
  objectives. The interactions of development and environmental policy objectives, 
  particularly as they affect non-Annex I nations, are discussed.</p>
<p><a href="432.htm">Section 10.4</a> looks at a series of policy-relevant scientific 
  questions related to global and international climate policy in more detail. 
  It focuses on what has been learned from work that examined decision making 
  at the global scale. While much of this literature is also cognizant of the 
  regional decisions that accumulate to determine global aggregates, it is united 
  by a global focus, common to all of the work discussed in the section. It explores 
  what is known about costs and benefits of actions, the timing and composition 
  of policy responses, and the influence of equity and fairness considerations 
  on policy. Finally, some concluding remarks and an outline of future tasks are 
  presented in the closing section.</p>
<p>The long tradition of using the terms decision analysis (and frameworks) and 
  decision making (and frameworks) largely interchangeably, and both meaning scientific 
  inquiries to serve decision makers, has resulted in some confusion in the case 
  of climate change. With a view to the political sensitivity of the issue, it 
  is important to clarify the terminology here at the beginning of this chapter. 
  Toth (2000) proposes a simple scheme to make a clear distinction to recognize 
  the fine borderline between a policy-relevant scientific assessment and policy 
  making proper. Climate change decision-making and decision analysis intended 
  to support it can be structured in three major domains: decision making <i>per 
  se</i> (the act of formulating decisions), decision analysis (aimed at providing 
  information for decision makers), and process analysis (investigating procedures 
  of decision making). The last two are sometimes difficult to separate and they 
  overlap in certain areas, but the distinction is still useful.</p>
<p>DMFs relevant to the climate problem have several levels. They stretch from 
  global and supranational fora through national and regional institutions down 
  to the micro-level of companies, families, and individuals. At each level, it 
  is useful to distinguish two parts of these DMFs: institutions that provide 
  the boundary conditions (jurisdictions, procedural rules, the body of earlier 
  agreements, etc.) and processes that fall within these frameworks (negotiations, 
  lobbying, persuasion). At the global level, for example, UNFCCC provides the 
  institutional part and negotiations represent the process part of the DMF.</p>
<p>To keep the term comprehensive and flexible, decision-analysis frameworks (DAFs) 
  are defined as analytical techniques aimed at synthesizing available information 
  from many (broader or narrower) segments of the climate problem to help policymakers 
  assess the consequences of various decision options within their own jurisdictions. 
  DAFs organize climate-relevant information in a suitable framework, apply a 
  decision criterion (based on some paradigms or theories), and identify options 
  that are better than others under the assumptions that characterize the analytical 
  framework and the application at hand. A broad range of DAFs has been used to 
  provide substantial information for the various DMFs involved in climate decisions 
  at various levels. The most important ones are depicted later in this section.</p>
<p>The third domain is process-analysis frameworks (PAFs), which involve assessments 
  of the decision-making process and provide guidance for decision making in two 
  main areas. The first is concerned with institutional framework design, that 
  is how to build policy regimes that address the problem effectively (Victor 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998; Young, 1999). The second looks at procedures of decision 
  making at various levels. The bulk of the literature on climate change addresses 
  global regime-building in framework analysis and international negotiations 
  in procedure analysis (Kremenyuk, 1991). Pertinent lessons from this literature 
  are assessed in <a href="396.htm">Section 10.2</a>.</p>
<p>The objective in this chapter is to provide a critical appraisal of policy-oriented 
  analyses and to summarize the emerging insights in a form that allows policymakers 
  to make informed judgements within the various DMFs. It is clearly not intended 
  to inflict any particular position upon the policymakers.</p>
