  <tr> 
    <td class="box"><b>Box 4.2. Disturbance, Age-class Distribution, and their 
      Implications for Forest Carbon Dynamics </b> 
      <p>At the stand scale, disturbance events (both natural and anthropogenic) 
        have three main impacts on the carbon budget (Apps and Kurz, 1993). First, 
        they redistribute the existing carbon by transferring carbon from living 
        material, above and below ground, to the dead organic matter pools. Second, 
        they transfer some of the carbon out of the ecosystem (e.g., into the 
        atmosphere as combustion products, in the case of fire, and/or into the 
        forest product sector as raw feedstock, in the case of harvest). Third, 
        by opening the forest canopy, the disturbance changes the site micro-environment 
        and restarts the successional cycle for new stand development.</p>
      <p>At the scale of forests (typically comprising many stands), the disturbance 
        regime determines the age-class structure (e.g., the even-age structure 
        associated with stand-replacing disturbance regimes or the uneven-age 
        structures associated with individual tree mortality and gap-phase replacement), 
        and age-class structure of stands and trees making up the forest. The 
        C stocks in a forest landscape, and the changes in these stocks over time, 
        are strongly influenced by the age-class distribution (Kurz <i>et al</i>., 
        1995b; Turner <i>et al</i>., 1995; MacLaren, 1996; Apps <i>et al</i>., 
        2000; Bhatti <i>et al</i>., 2001). In managed plantation forests, the 
        age-class distribution is controlled by the management regime and harvest 
        cycle (Heath and Birdsey, 1993; MacLaren, 1996), while in natural forests 
        other mortality agents play a major role. See Heath <i>et al</i>. (1996) 
        and Kurz <i>et al</i>. (1995a) for examples.<br>

<p><a name="box42"></a>Land management decisions are influenced by many factors. 
  In the temperate zone, and in the European parts of the boreal zone, these are 
  mainly technological and economic. Agricultural production is, for example, 
  heavily influenced by evolving technologies, economic opportunities, subsidies, 
  and restrictions on international trade. Forestry practices are similarly influenced 
  by economic returns, trade, and pressures from society (Clawson, 1979; Waggoner, 
  1994; Wernick <i>et al</i>., 1998). It is within these pressures and opportunities 
  that carbon mitigation possibilities may be found, and preferably they would 
  be region specific. <a href="#tab42">Table 4.2</a> gives an overview of some 
  of the specific issues of importance in the temperate and boreal zone of the 
  world.</p>
Competition for land between forestry and agriculture has become less severe. 
Forest area is increasing in many regions of the boreal and temperate zone, partly 
because agricultural yields have improved or because the profitability of marginal 
agriculture has declined. The ability to produce agricultural goods has grown 
faster than demand, resulting in a downwards trend in prices (Alig <i>et al</i>., 
1990; Waggoner, 1994). Much abandoned agricultural land has reverted to forest, 
either naturally or through deliberate planting. Superimposed over these land 
conversions is a transition in forestry from a foraging and gathering operation, 
dependent upon primary forest, through a stage of more intensively managed forest, 
to total forest ecosystem management. The latter occurs when urbanized societies 
press for nature-oriented forest management. Continuously improving technologies 
allow low-cost establishment and higher productivity from planted and plantation 
forests (Sedjo, 1983; 1999a). In agriculture, also, practices are changing towards 
maintaining site fertility or decreasing the risk of erosion.<br>
<br>
Silvicultural practices have increased forest growth in many boreal and temperate 
regions. The increasing concentration of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> may also have 
contributed to the enhanced growth of forests. 
<p>Incentives for planting forests are provided by a combination of market factors 
  and public policy. Remaining wild forests, such as the public forests in the 
  US National Forest System and in British Columbia, are becoming less accessible 
  and have increased harvesting restrictions. Subsidies to harvesting of natural 
  forests are also being withdrawn elsewhere. For example, large subsidies for 
  harvesting Russian forests were prevalent during the Soviet era, largely through 
  subsidized transportation, but have now disappeared. The economic structures 
  are in transition and industrial production has declined. As a result, harvests 
  have fallen dramatically in Russia since the 1990s (Nilsson and Shvidenko 1998). 
</p>
<p>Market forces, reflecting industrial needs for wood, have provided financial 
  incentives for expansion of commercial forests (Sedjo and Lyon, 1990). This 
  is a trend expected to continue, because of growing demand for industrial wood 
  and low profitability in agriculture (Sohngen <i>et al</i>., 1999). Early analyses 
  suggested that economic returns from plantations (in the tropics as well as 
  in the temperate and boreal zone) justify investment in a number of regions 
  (Sedjo, 1983). Recent studies confirm that forest plantations are being established 
  at a rate of 600,000ha/yr (Pandey, 1992; Postel and Heise, 1988; UN-ECE/FAO, 
  2000). However, industrial plantation forestry is new in many tropical areas 
  and yields vary considerably across ecosystems. In many locations where plantations 
  have only recently been established, little is known about the potential capabilities 
  for increasing productivity as well as the potential problems that may limit 
  yields.<a name="tab42"><br>
