<h3>5.3.7 Information Provision </h3>
<p>Consumers of energy-using technologies cannot make good decisions regarding 
  which technologies to employ unless they possess the appropriate information. 
  The need for information creates three potential types of market failures with 
  respect to energy-using technologies (Jaffe and Stavins, 1994).</p>
<p><i>Information as a Public Good </i><br>
  Generic information regarding the availability of different kinds of technologies 
  and their performance characteristics may have the attributes of a &#147;public 
  good&#148;, and hence may be underprovided by the private market. This relates 
  both to information that consumers need to acquire about specific technologies, 
  as well as to information that manufacturers need to acquire regarding the attributes 
  and needs of consumers. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that even after 
  a technology is in place and being used, it is often difficult to quantify the 
  energy savings that resulted from its installation, since usage patterns and 
  outside influences such as weather may have changed. Knowing that this uncertainty 
  will prevail can itself inhibit technology diffusion, as internal or external 
  advocates for a new technology may doubt that they will be able to justify investment 
  decisions after the fact. Firms supplying products or services within a particular 
  market learn from one another with respect to understanding the market and operating 
  effectively in it. The processes and networks by which this learning takes place, 
  such as professional associations, conferences, publications, and informal networks 
  are often weak in developing countries and EITs. </p>
<p><i>Adoption Externalities</i><br>
  One of the mechanisms for the transmission of both generic information and application-specific 
  information may be the process of technology adoption itself. That is, one way 
  that a user learns about a new technology is by seeing it used or communicating 
  with other agents that have used it. In this case, the adoption of the new technology 
  by a given user creates a positive information externality, by lowering the 
  cost for others to acquire useful information. This implies that the act of 
  adoption has social benefits that exceed its private benefits, and hence will 
  be inadequately undertaken by private agents.</p>
<p><i>Misplaced or &#147;Split&#148; Incentives</i><b> </b><br>
  The third form of informational barrier arises in an institutional context in 
  which investment decisions regarding energy technology must be made in an environment 
  of &#147;agency,&#148; that is, one economic agent must make an investment decision 
  that affects the energy costs of some other agent. Examples include contractors 
  who build for others, and tenant-landlord situations where investments are made 
  by the landlord that reduce a tenants&#146; energy costs (or vice versa). In 
  these situations, the party making the investment can recover that investment 
  from the party paying the energy costs only if the investor can credibly convince 
  the consumer that the energy savings justify the investment. That may not happen, 
  however, because information is costly to convey credibly.</p>
<p>The limitations that inadequate information places on decision-making depend 
  on the context. Institutions play an important role both in transmitting information, 
  and in determining the extent to which incentives exist to share and act on 
  information. There is therefore a close relationship between informational and 
  institutional barriers, as evidenced by the discussion of &#147;misplaced incentives&#148; 
  in the previous paragraph and previous subsection. Finally, in many situations 
  it is difficult to determine the extent to which apparently efficient decisions 
  are limited by inadequate information, or whether instead the information is 
  available but decision makers&#146; bounded rationality limits their ability 
  to utilize information effectively.</p>
