<h4>5.3.8.5 Discourse and Symbolism </h4>
<p>The spread of new communication technology may make it increasingly difficult 
  for governments to exert a direct influence on social structure and culture. 
  On the other hand, governments, along with the business community and NGOs, 
  continue to have a substantial presence in the media and they all contribute 
  to the shaping of the public discourse on climate change (see <a href="#box53">Box 
  5.3</a>). Some of the essential features of that discourse are the differing 
  views on the risks and uncertainties associated with GHG emissions; the costs 
  and benefits of GHG mitigation; the allocation of blame for past and current 
  emissions; and the rights of the victims of climate change to compensation. 
  Disagreement on these various points poses an important barrier to GHG mitigation, 
  especially where media presentation tends to emphasize controversy. There are 
  many ways of helping to build of a common discourse, or narrative, about climate 
  change, involving the various players taking all available opportunities to 
  meet, discuss, and work together for common goals. An important example is the 
  growing development of partnerships between transnational companies and environmental 
  NGOs, for example, to develop accreditation schemes for green products or to 
  design environmental strategies.</p>

  <tr> 
    <td class="box"><b>Box 5.3. Narratives about Climate Mitigation </b> 
      <p>Discourse or narrative &#150; the written and spoken word &#150; is one 
        of the most important ways in which governments, businesses, NGOs, and 
        the media influence each other and build agreement on policy directions. 
        One of the most important barriers to GHG mitigation is the perception 
        by some participants in national and international discourses that mitigation 
        efforts might be costly, or might conflict with values such as individual 
        freedom and equity. By analyzing these people&#146;s discourse, new opportunities 
        may be identified for developing GHG mitigation measures that are consistent 
        with their core values. It may also be possible to build new coalitions 
        among institutions and actors, to seek mutually satisfactory GHG mitigation 
        strategies.</p>
      <p>Discourse and narrative can take many forms, including history, science, 
        philosophy, folklore, and &#147;common sense&#148;. Foucault (1961, 1975) 
        has shown how narratives become an instrument for wielding power. MacIntyre 
        (1985) offers a way of thinking about narrative as part of our cultural 
        context or tradition, as something that we inhabit. Professional analysts, 
        such as scientists and economists, are members of groups that define themselves 
        by such traditions and have their own narratives about the world. Our 
        narratives co-evolve with our notions of &#147;the good&#148;, our understanding 
        of our selves, our conception of society, our science (conception of nature), 
        and our understanding of God or the spiritual dimension (Taylor, 1989; 
        Latour, 1993). These understandings and conceptions are also central to 
        our responses to climate change.</p>
      <p>Analyzing discourses can provide essential insights into different people&#146;s 
        assumptions and beliefs about the world. Thompson and Rayner (1998), Ney 
        (2000) and Thompson (2000) have mapped out some of the essential features 
        of the discourses that are used to describe and define positions on climate 
        change. They focus in particular on two axes of the discourses: their 
        view of nature and their conception of society. For example, some view 
        the environment as robust, while others view it as fragile and vulnerable 
        to human interference. Some believe that society works best through market-based 
        institutions, while others believe that there should be more explicit 
        emphasis on egalitarian, participatory approaches. Ney differentiates 
        three main orientations: market-based, egalitarian, and contractarian 
        or hierarchical. Some characteristics of these orientations are summarized 
        in <a href="#tab53">Table 5.3</a>. Of these three, the market orientation 
        clearly dominates international negotiations as well as the dialogue on 
        climate change within many countries. It is also the source of the dominant 
        discourse on climate mitigation policy within the IPCC.</p>

      <p>There are, in fact, many &#147;axes&#148; that can be used to map out 
        discourses on climate change. Another important perspective is that of 
        gender (Grover <i>et al</i>., 1999; Hemmati, 2000). To some extent, the different 
        axes can be correlated with those chosen by Ney, Rayner, and Thompson: 
        feminist discourses have tended to align themselves with egalitarian discourses 
        and in opposition to the hierarchical and market discourses as defined 
        in <a href="#tab53">Table 5.3</a>.</p>
      <p>While analyzing different positions can be a first step to resolving 
        differences, something more is needed: we need to understand how the dialogues 
        that underlie the climate debate have evolved over time, and might change 
        in the future. In particular, we need to be more aware of the links between 
        our scientific understanding of nature, our political and economic structures, 
        and our ethics. Michaelis (2000) finds traces in the climate debate of 
        a long-running process of development of alternative cultures or traditions 
        in our society:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The modern tradition, with roots in the 17th-18th century European 
          Enlightenment, is built on a separation of humanity and nature, with 
          its central aims of economic and technological progress and its commitment 
          to finding &#147;the good&#148; in the everyday working life. This tradition 
          is dominant in the words of government, business, and science. To a 
          large extent, the different positions analyzed by Ney (2000), Thompson 
          and Rayner (1998), and Thompson (2000) fall within the modern tradition. 
          The climate debate within this tradition revolves around different ways 
          of understanding nature and society.</li>
        <li>The romantic tradition, a reaction to the early Enlightenment in the 
          late 18th and early 19th century, is committed to the emotional life 
          of individuals, to romantic love and the family, and to an ideal harmony 
          between humanity and nature. This tradition is dominant in the world 
          of entertainment, advertising, and individuals&#146; private lives. 
          It views climate change as a problem caused by the modern tradition, 
          and tends to blame institutions such as businesses and governments which 
          represent that tradition. However, narratives within the romantic tradition 
          tend not to recognize the role of romanticism in shaping the consumption 
          patterns for which industry produces.</li>
        <li>The humanist tradition, with much older roots going back to ancient 
          Greece, is maintained by academic and intellectual circles in modern 
          society, and is committed to the search for &#147;the good life&#148;. 
          Viewed from this tradition, the climate change problem appears to be 
          caused by the failure of the modern and romantic traditions to understand 
          human nature, and the nature of the good life. Less emphasis should 
          be placed on material production and consumption, and more should be 
          placed on developing family relationships, communities, civic involvement, 
          and opportunities for learning and contemplation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Writers such as MacIntyre (1985), Gare (1995), and Latour (1993) see 
        little hope within the modern tradition for solving the problems of our 
        time. MacIntyre advocates a revival of humanism. However, many social 
        scientists have described the emergence of &#147;postmodern&#148; values, 
        which recognize the multiplicity of valid traditions and narratives. This 
        recognition sometimes leads to nihilism, but it could also be the basis 
        for a renewed search for shared values and conceptions of the good life.</p>
    </td>

</table>
<p>The linking of symbols to fundamental values may also be important in shaping 
  behaviour. Ger <i>et al</i>. (1998) compare the symbolism of consumption patterns, 
  based on interviews and observations in Denmark, Turkey, and Japan. They find 
  that the symbolic attractions of resource-intensive consumption patterns are 
  more powerful than those of more sustainable consumption patterns. The symbolic 
  attachments are different depending on the country and the subculture within 
  the country. </p>
<p>Narrative and symbols carried by the mass media form a large part of the means 
  through which ideas, arguments, and values are transferred from the public to 
  the private sphere, and ultimately may be integrated into individuals&#146; 
  consciousness and identity. Moisander (1998) has observed that consumption choices 
  respond strongly to personal morals or ethics. It is in shaping ethics that 
  the public narrative can play a particularly strong role.</p>
