<h3>10.4.2 What Should the Response Be? The Relationship between Adaptation and 
  Mitigation </h3>
<p>The principal objective of mitigation activities is to reduce the amount of 
  anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHG emissions in order to slow down and 
  thus delay climate change. Ultimately, this is to achieve &#147;stabilization 
  of GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous 
  anthropogenic interference with the climate system&#148; (UNFCCC, 1993, Article 
  2). In contrast, climate change adaptation aims to reduce adverse consequences 
  of climate change and to enhance positive impacts, through private action and/or 
  public measures (<a href="#box103">Box 10.3</a>). Adaptation activities include 
  behavioural, institutional, and technological adjustments. They capture a wide 
  array of potential strategies, such as coastal protection, establishing corridors 
  for migrating species, searching for drought-resistant crops, altering planting 
  patterns, forest management, as well as personal savings or insurance that may 
  cover the damage expected by individuals (Toman and Bierbaum, 1996). Adaptation 
  is a central theme of WGII (IPCC, 2001b).</p>

    <td class="box"><b>Box 10.3. Mitigation and Adaptation </b> 
      <p>Mitigation consists of activities that aim to reduce GHG emissions directly 
        or indirectly (e.g., by changing behavioural patterns, or by developing 
        and diffusing relevant technologies), by capturing GHGs before they are 
        emitted to the atmosphere or sequestering GHGs already in the atmosphere 
        by enhancing their sinks.</p>
      <p>Adaptation is defined as adjustments in human and natural systems, in 
        response to actual or expected climate stimuli or their effects, that 
        moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities (see IPCC, 2001b)</p>

<p>Whereas mitigation deals with the causes of climate change, adaptation tackles 
  the consequences. As a result, the distribution of benefits from mitigation 
  and adaptation policies is fundamentally different in terms of damage avoided. 
  Mitigation will have only a long-term global impact on climate change damage, 
  while adaptation options usually generate a positive effect in a shorter term. 
  Adaptation activities mainly benefit those who implement them, while gains from 
  mitigation activities accrue also to those who have not invested into the abatement 
  policies. Mitigation is plagued by the free-rider problem and might create severe 
  problems for decision making as opposed to adaptation, in which free-riding 
  is much more limited. Hence, the output of mitigation activities can be viewed 
  as a global public good, while the output of adaptation measures is either a 
  private good in the case of autonomous adaptation or a regional or national 
  public good in the case of public strategies (Callaway <i>et al</i>., 1998; Leary, 
  1999). Mitigation policies at the global scale are efficient only if all major 
  emitters implement their accepted reduction commitments. In contrast, most adaptation 
  policies are carried out by those for whom averted damage exceeds the respective 
  costs (Jepma and Munasinghe, 1998).</p>
<p>What adaptation and mitigation actions have in common is that they both avoid 
  climate change damages. So far the debate about climate change policy has been 
  dominated by emission reduction activities. The strong bias towards mitigation 
  schemes has resulted in a relatively poor incorporation of adaptive response 
  strategies into climate change analysis, although methods on how to evaluate 
  and assess adaptive response strategies have already been elaborated (Feenstra 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998; Parry and Carter, 1998). The reasons for this are diverse. Adaptation 
  has been associated with an attitude of fatalism and acceptance. Putting too 
  much emphasis on adaptation strategies might raise the notions that mitigation 
  efforts have little effect, that climate change is inevitable, and/or that mitigation 
  measures are unnecessary. Approaching the climate issue from the adaptive side 
  might inhibit concerted rational action by governments, as adaptation measures 
  are conducted and rewarded locally. Consequently, there is no incentive to participate 
  in international negotiations if a country considers itself to be able to adapt 
  fully to climate change (Pielke, 1998).</p>
