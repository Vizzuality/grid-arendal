<h3>10.4.7 Emerging Conclusions with Respect to Policy-relevant Scientific Questions 
</h3>
<p>Looking at the dilemmas covered in previous sections, the following conclusions 
  emerge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a carefully crafted portfolio of mitigation, adaptation, and learning activities 
    appears to be appropriate over the next few decades to hedge against the risk 
    of intolerable magnitudes and/or rates of climate change (impact side) and 
    against the need to undertake painfully drastic emission reductions if the 
    resolution of uncertainties reveals that climate change and its impacts might 
    imply high risks;<br>
  </li>
  <li>the nature of the climate change problem requires that mitigation action 
    at any level needs to start in the near term, as well as the development of 
    appropriate adaptation strategies;<br>
  </li>
  <li>emission reduction is an important form of mitigation, but the mitigation 
    portfolio includes a broad range of other activities, including investments 
    to develop low-cost non-carbon energy, and to improve energy efficiency and 
    carbon management technologies to make future CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation inexpensive;<br>
  </li>
  <li>timing and composition of mitigation measures (investment in technological 
    development or immediate emission reductions) is highly controversial because 
    of the technological features of energy systems, and the range of uncertainties 
    involved with, for example, their impacts of climate change;<br>
  </li>
  <li>international flexibility instruments help reduce the costs of emission 
    reductions, but they raise a series of implementation and verification issues 
    that need to be balanced against the cost savings;<br>
  </li>
  <li>while there is a broad consensus on Pareto optimality as an efficiency principle, 
    there is no agreement on the best equity principle for burden sharing. Efficiency 
    and equity are important concerns in negotiating emissions limitation schemes, 
    and they are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, equity will play an important 
    role in determining the distribution of emissions allowances and/or within 
    compensation schemes that follow emissions trading resulting in a disproportionately 
    high level of burden to certain countries. Finally, it is more important to 
    rely on politically feasible burden-sharing rules than to select one specific 
    equity principle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, a series of potential large-scale geophysical transformations that 
  might exert a major influence on the desired level of stabilization have been 
  identified and examined more closely in recent years. These imply thresholds 
  that humanity might decide not to cross because the potential impacts or even 
  the associated risks are considered to be unacceptably high. Little is know 
  about these thresholds today. Most recent results and the implications of the 
  possibility of such thresholds are summarized in Chapter 19 of WGII (IPCC, 2001b). 
  Nevertheless, currently estimated &#147;danger zones&#148; are in the domain 
  of high stabilization levels for most threshold events.</p>
<p>Considering the special combination of features of the climate problem listed 
  at the beginning of this chapter, it is obvious that no &#147;once forever&#148; 
  solution exists. Making long-term commitments in any area where retraction is 
  possible is problematic. Making decisions that entail long-term and possibly 
  irreversible consequences due to long delays, inertia and similar system properties 
  is even more difficult, especially under severe uncertainties. Therefore, as 
  emphasized in this chapter, the most promising approach to climate policy is 
  sequential decision-making. This process involves a regular reassessment of 
  the long-term climate risks (net damages from a given magnitude of climate change) 
  and their management objectives (climate or GHG concentration stabilization) 
  in the light of newly available information. Short-term strategies are then 
  crafted so that both GHG emissions and the underlying socioeconomic processes 
  (resource use, technologies) evolve in a direction which makes future course 
  corrections in any direction the least expensive. The current structure of the 
  international climate regime is formulated in this vein: the UNFCCC provides 
  some, albeit vague, guidelines for long term stabilization objectives while 
  short-term goals are settled in and implemented under protocols for each budget 
  period.</p>
<p>The analytical tools to support the above decision-making processes need to 
  handle this double feature. They should provide policymakers with guidance to 
  set long-term targets and to formulate short-term policies and measures. Some 
  models take a long-term view to explore deep future impacts of climate change, 
  but this must not be interpreted as suggesting optimal strategies for the next 
  50-100-200 years. Other models explore what are the most promising near-term 
  policies and how to implement them. Similarly, many studies and models reviewed 
  in this chapter consider the world as a whole or broken down into a few regions, 
  at best. Others take a more detailed look at subnational and regional aspects. 
  They shed light on the smaller scale implications of climate change and its 
  management strategies, often in the context of other social concerns characterizing 
  the country or region. Our assessment has found a healthy diversity of DAFs 
  along both the long-term-short term and the global-local axes. Nevertheless, 
  the analytical capacity and thus quotable results are still badly missing in 
  most developing countries. This is probably the most severe problem to be solved 
  by the time the world community will prepare its next climate change assessment 
  report.<br>
