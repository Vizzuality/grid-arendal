<p><a name="fig102"></a>One way to avoid the bias inherent in the framing of the 
  emissions control problem under uncertainty is to reframe the problem as a decision 
  tree structure within the context of cost&#150;benefit analysis rather than 
  cost-effectiveness analysis. This was the approach taken by the seven models 
  used in an Energy Modeling Forum (EMF; Manne, 1995) exercise on climate change 
  decision making under uncertainty (Weyant, 1997). The study focused on hedging 
  strategies for low probability, high consequence scenarios in which uncertainty 
  was not resolved until 2020. Two parameters were varied: the mean temperature 
  sensitivity factor and the cost of damages associated with global warming. The 
  unfavourable cases were defined as the top 5% of each of these two distributions. 
  Two surveys of expert opinion were used to choose the distribution of these 
  variables. For the opinion survey on climate sensitivity, see Morgan and Keith 
  (1995), and for warming damages, see Nordhaus (1994b). <a href="#fig102">Figure 
  10.2</a> (Manne and Richels, 1995; Manne 1995) shows what happens when the unfavourable 
  case has a probability of 0.5 and the expected case a probability of 0.95 (the 
  two parameter values assumed for the unfavourable case are shown in the surveys 
  cited above as being in the upper 5% of each of the distributions of the two 
  key parameters, i.e., climate sensitivity and climate damages). The dashed lines 
  show what happens if perfect foresight is available and can make today&#146;s 
  decisions in the full knowledge of which of these outcomes will occur. The solid 
  lines indicate the average results from an economically efficient hedging strategy. 
  The analysis takes into account both the costs and benefits of emissions abatement. 
  With a cost-benefit analysis, costs and benefits are balanced at the margin. 
  Seven EMF modelling teams have confirmed these results (Weyant, 1997). The reason 
  for so little hedging is the low probability of the extreme outcome, that is 
  0.25%. If one were to increases this probability, the desired degree of hedging 
  would increase accordingly.</p>
<p>Another parameter for stochastic cost&#150;benefit analysis is the importance 
  of non-linearity in the impacts and the date at which some threshold is likely 
  to occur. Peck and Tiesberg (1993) observed that optimal policies were more 
  sensitive to uncertainty in the damage-function power parameter than to uncertainty 
  in the scale parameter. Ha-Duong et al. (1999) confirm this view and demonstrate 
  that introducing thresholds in the damage function leads to more significant 
  decoupling from current emissions trends for a given probability distribution.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as recognized in the IPCC (1996c) one should try and assess the 
  option value of the information incorporated in alternative emissions pathways, 
  that is the capacity of society to adapt to any new information. As pointed 
  out by Ulph and Ulph (1997), the environmental irreversibility has to be balanced 
  against the technological irreversibility, including the crowding out between 
  forms of technical progress. Ha-Duong (1998) finds, comparing Working Group 
  I (WGI) and Wigley, Richels, Edmonds (WRE) strategies, that the magnitude of 
  the value of information is significant compared with the opportunity costs 
  of abatement. On the basis of nine scenarios he found that the information value 
  of acting soon is, for most of them, higher than that of acting later, if low 
  and high damages are assumed equally probable.</p>
<p>Whatever the approach, the basic message is quite similar. First the costs 
  and benefits of quick action have to be balanced against those of delayed action; 
  second, to assume that the concentration target is known with certainty is an 
  over-simplification of the decision problem. What is needed is an approach that 
  explicitly incorporates uncertainty and its sequential resolution over time. 
  The desirable amount of hedging should depend upon assessment of the stakes, 
  the odds, and the costs of policy measures. The risk premium &#150; the amount 
  that society is willing to pay to reduce risk &#150; ultimately is a political 
  decision that differs among countries.</p>
<p>Uncertainty also affects the choice of policy instrument. In principle many 
  mechanisms can be employed to limit emissions, including, voluntary agreements 
  among domestic and international parties, regulation, taxes, subsidies, and 
  quotas or tradable permits (see <a href="224.htm">Chapter 6</a>). Economists 
  have focused on the potential role of taxes and quotas because these tools hold 
  potential for cost minimization. Although both instruments are equivalent in 
  a world with complete information (the optimal quota leads to the same marginal 
  abatement cost as the optimal tax level), Pizer (1999), building upon a seminal 
  work by Weizman (1974), demonstrated that this is not the case if uncertainties 
  about climate damage and GHG abatement costs are considered.</p>
<p>Indeed, welfare losses that result from imperfect foresight depend on whether 
  the steepness of the marginal abatement cost curve is higher or lower than that 
  of the damage curve. Hence the finding that a co-ordination through price is 
  preferable as long as the probability of dramatic non-linearity in climate systems 
  is not large over the middle term. This policy conclusion can be reverted if 
  the transaction costs of adopting co-ordinated taxation, high level of risk-aversion 
  to catastrophic events, or a large amount of &#147;no regrets&#148; policies 
  are considered. The main message, however, is that in a tax co-ordination approach 
  costs are observable (while the outcome is not predictable), but in a quota 
  approach the outcome is observable although there is an uncertainty about the 
  resultant costs. In this respect, emissions trading is logically a companion 
  tool for a system of emissions quotas, to hedge against the distributional implications 
  of surprises regarding abatement costs and emissions baselines.</p>
