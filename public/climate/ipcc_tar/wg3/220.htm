<h3>5.5.2 Countries Undergoing Transition to a Market Economy in Central and Eastern 
  Europe and the New Independent States </h3>
<p>The collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe and the subsequent 
  disintegration of the Soviet Union brought the region&#146;s serious environmental 
  problems to the attention of the international community. Although the countries 
  in this vast area of the world are remarkably diverse, central economic planning 
  had created a common pattern of environmental problems which included wastefulness, 
  pollution-intensive economic systems, ill-designed and resource heavy technologies, 
  and perverse incentives encouraging increase of output rather than enhancing 
  efficiency of resource use. A universal feature was also the world&#146;s highest 
  energy and carbon intensity of economies.</p>
<p>A Soviet-type economy has left a legacy of acute health effects from local 
  pollution. Having very scarce resources, the transition economies have so far 
  focused mainly on mitigating local pollution rather than emissions of GHGs. 
  However, wherever environmental policies were successful in the region, they 
  have also brought important climate dividends. Some countries in the region 
  (e.g., Poland) have introduced specific climate change mitigation policy instruments, 
  such as charges on CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions.</p>
<p>At the end of first decade of the transition to a market economy, contrasts 
  between different countries in the region have outstripped bygone relative homogeneity. 
  Central Europe and the Baltic countries have made a successful leap in economic 
  reforms and restructuring, while countries of the former Soviet Union (so called 
  New Independent States - NIS) continue to struggle with economic recession and 
  political instability (EBRD, 1999). Recent empirical studies on the interrelationship 
  between environmental improvement and economic development in transition economies 
  undertaken by the World Bank, EBRD, and OECD have demonstrated that countries 
  that were more successful in economic development and structural reforms have 
  generally also been more successful in curbing emissions through targeted environmental 
  policies. Aggregated GDP among advanced reforming countries has been gradually 
  increasing, while emissions of main air pollutants have continued to decrease. 
  Energy consumption has been stabilized and a switch away from coal has been 
  recorded mainly in Poland and the Czech Republic causing GHG-intensity of GDP 
  to decrease. In contrast, in the slower reforming countries in NIS, falling 
  output, rather than economic restructuring or environmental protection efforts, 
  appears to have been the main factor behind the decrease of energy use and emissions 
  of pollutants, including GHGs (OECD, 1999a).</p>
<p>In the more advanced economies of the region, economic reforms have helped 
  generate resources for investment in cleaner, more efficient technologies; reduced 
  the share of energy- and GHG-intensive heavy industries in economic activity; 
  and helped curb emissions as part of the shift towards more efficient production 
  methods (OECD, 2000). In some sectors, however, the transition has brought greater 
  climate pressures. For example, in those countries returning to economic growth, 
  the use of motor vehicles for both passenger and freight transport has increased 
  rapidly.</p>
<p><i>Energy Pricing and Subsidies</i><b> </b><br>
  Virtually all countries in the region have embarked on the liberation of energy 
  prices and elimination of energy subsidies. Significant successes in this field 
  have been achieved in Central European and Baltic States. However, in NIS a 
  sharp reduction of explicit subsidies has resulted in an almost immediate build 
  up of hidden subsidies to energy producers and users, such as arrears and non-monetary 
  forms of payments for energy (EBRD, 1999).</p>
<p><i>Finance and Income</i><b> </b><br>
  Lack of adequate access to capital for GHG emission reduction technologies is 
  perceived as a bottleneck in many countries in the region (World Bank, 1998). 
  However, in CEE financial and capital markets are becoming mature enough to 
  provide increasingly better access to credit for fuel switching or energy efficiency, 
  especially given stable macroeconomic conditions and relatively high energy 
  prices. In these countries the main bottleneck to environmental finance is not 
  the lack of finance, but rather the lack of a &#147;pull factor&#148;. Lack 
  of implementation of the Polluter Pays Principle, and weak enforcement of the 
  environmental and climate policy framework does not stimulate sufficient demand 
  for investments that would bring mainly GHG reduction benefits, with little 
  private financial return (OECD, 1999b). In NIS, however, the weak policy framework 
  is aggravated by the overwhelming lack of liquidity both in the public and private 
  sector. Limited financial resources, which are available to authorities have 
  not always been used in a cost-effective way. Opportunities to leverage additional 
  financing from public and private, domestic and foreign sources were also underutilized 
  (OECD, 2000).</p>
<p><i>Institutional Aspects </i><br>
  The countries in the region have undergone a rapid deregulation and privatization 
  on a short time scale that has no precedence in the history of the world. This 
  process in the Baltic and Central European countries has generally led to increased 
  resource efficiency and replacement of obsolete and GHG intensive technologies. 
  However, in a number of countries of the former Soviet Union, particularly in 
  Russia and Ukraine, the rapid pace of liberalization and privatization has not 
  been matched by the development of institutions as well as a regulatory and 
  incentive framework necessary to support a well-functioning market economy. 
  Perverse incentives that had generated many of the environmental problems of 
  centrally planned economies, such as rent seeking and lack of incentives for 
  efficiency and restructuring, now undermine restructuring of already private 
  enterprises (EBRD, 1999). But successful economic policies have not been a panacea 
  for successful GHG-mitigation improvements. Targeted environmental policies 
  and institutions in Central Europe were required to harness the positive forces 
  of market reform, and ensure that enterprises and other economic actors improve 
  their environmental performance which are still weak in the NIS (World Bank, 
  1998).</p>
