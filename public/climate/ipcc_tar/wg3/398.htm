<h3>10.2.3 No Participation </h3>
<p>No participation constitutes the benchmark for evaluating the costs and benefits 
  of policies designed to control GHG emissions under alternative coalition structures. 
  It is usually named the baseline (or business as usual) scenario, because it 
  identifies the values of the main environmental and economic variables when 
  no coalition forms and no action, unilateral or co-operative, is adopted (IPCC 
  SAR (IPCC, 1995) is a good example of this approach). The construction of the 
  baseline scenario is very important to assess both the profitability and the 
  stability (<i>i.e.</i>, whether it is self-enforcing) of a coalition. A coalition is 
  profitable when welfare after the coalition is formed is larger than in the 
  no participation case. A coalition is self-enforcing if there are no incentives 
  to leave or enter the coalition. The baseline scenario crucially affects these 
  incentives also. If the no participation case is such that emissions decline 
  and the target can be achieved easily through small emission reductions, then 
  the incentives to join the coalition (sign the agreement) are much higher, so 
  a coalition with many countries is more likely to form (Barrett, 1997b). Symmetrically, 
  if large emission reductions are necessary, abatement becomes more costly, and 
  incentives to free-ride increase, which further increases the costs for co-operating 
  countries (particularly if leakage is high).</p>
<p>A careful definition of the no participation case is therefore very relevant 
  to assess the likelihood of large coalitions and thus the efficiency of a climate 
  agreement. But it is also very relevant in terms of equity. When the burden 
  of emissions abatement has to be shared equitably, it is important to distribute 
  emissions targets with reference to the baseline scenario. Each country therefore 
  has an incentive to pretend that its own baseline scenario implies larger emissions 
  than is actually true (Grubb, 1998; Bohm, 1999). In this way, the actual cost 
  for the country would be lower. An optimistic scenario in which predicted emissions 
  are lower than &#147;true&#148; emissions (as measured ex-post) leads countries 
  to agree on low emission-reduction targets, but forces countries to more reductions 
  later and to pay abatement costs larger than expected. A pessimistic scenario 
  makes the agreement more difficult because larger emission reductions have to 
  be agreed, but countries find themselves in a better situation and pay lower 
  costs ex-post. Hence, if a country succeeds in convincing the others that its 
  own baseline emissions are larger than the &#147;true&#148; ones, then this 
  country achieves relative benefits in terms of less-stringent emission targets 
  and lower abatement costs.</p>
<p>The definition of a baseline scenario has therefore a strategic dimension and 
  can hardly be defined as an &#147;objective&#148; evaluation of future economic 
  and environmental cycles and trends. It is therefore important to collect, as 
  in <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a>, the largest amount of information from 
  different sources and to identify the scenario more as an average of much scattered 
  information, rather than as a subjective analysis of likely future events. This 
  may reduce the likelihood of strategic definitions of the baseline scenario 
  and may partly prevent the consequent impacts on the equilibrium coalition and 
  on the assessment of costs and benefits of climate policies.</p>
