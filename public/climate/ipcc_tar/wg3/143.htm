<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and to a lesser extent perfluorocarbons (PFCs) have 
  been introduced to replace ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) that are being 
  phased out under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone 
  Layer. HFCs and PFCs have a significant global warming potential (GWP) and are 
  listed in the Kyoto Protocol. This Appendix estimates consumption and emissions 
  and assesses alternative practices and technologies to reduce emissions. Emissions 
  as by-products of manufacturing are treated in the main part of <a href="089.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>.</p>
<p>In the absence of the Montreal Protocol the use of chlorine- containing compounds 
  and especially CFCs would have expanded significantly. However, because of this 
  treaty, developed countries replaced about 8% of projected chlorofluorocarbon 
  use with HFCs, 12% with HCFCs, and eliminated the remaining 80% by controlling 
  emissions, specific use reductions, or by using alternative technologies and 
  fluids including ammonia, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, water, and not-in-kind 
  options.</p>
<p>In 1997, the production of HFCs was about 125 kilotons (50MtC<sub>eq</sub>), 
  and the production of PFCs amounted to 5 kilotons (12MtC<sub>eq</sub>). The 
  production of HFCs in 2010 is projected to be about 370 kilotons or 170MtC<sub>eq</sub> 
  and less than 12MtC<sub>eq</sub> for PFCs, assuming current trends in use and 
  regulations, substantial investment in new HFC production capacity, and success 
  of voluntary agreements. Since most of the HFCs and some of the PFCs are contained 
  in equipment or products, annual emissions lag production when use is growing.</p>
<p>Refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pumps are the largest source of emissions 
  of HFCs. Improved design, tighter components, and recovery and recycling during 
  servicing and disposal can reduce lifetime HFC emissions at moderate to low 
  costs. Non-HFC alternatives include hydrocarbons, ammonia, and carbon dioxide, 
  or alternative technologies. Lifecycle climate performance (LCCP) analysis of 
  the entire system, including direct fluid emissions and indirect emissions from 
  carbon dioxide resulting from energy use by the device, provides a means of 
  assessing the net contribution of a system to global climate change. The LCCP 
  calculations are very system specific and can be used to make relative rankings. 
  However, since the LCCP approach involves regional climate conditions and local 
  energy sources, the results cannot be generalized in order to make globally 
  valid comparisons.</p>
<p>Insulating foams are anticipated to become the second largest source of HFC 
  emissions and HFC use is expected to grow rapidly as CFCs and HCFCs are replaced 
  with HFC-134a, HFC-245fa, and HFC-365mfc. Alternative blowing agents including 
  the different pentanes and carbon dioxide have lower direct climate impact from 
  direct emissions. However, they also have lower insulating values than CFCs 
  and HCFCs, and hence may have higher indirect emissions from energy use if the 
  foam thickness is not increased to offset the higher conductivity. Non-foam 
  insulation alternatives such as mineral fibres are also used, and vacuum panels 
  may play a role in the future.</p>
<p>Other sources of HFC and PFC emissions are industrial solvent applications, 
  medical aerosol products, other aerosol products, fire protection, and non-insulating 
  foams. A variety of options are available to reduce emissions including increased 
  containment, recovery, destruction, and substitution by non-fluorocarbon fluids 
  and not-in-kind technologies. There are no zero- or low-GWP alternatives for 
  some medical and fire protection applications. </p>
