<h4>2.5.2.4 Comparison of Technology and/or Policy Measures and Assessment of 
  Robustness </h4>
<p>Assumed technology and/or policy options differ among models (Morita <i>et al.</i>, 
  2000a). These differences are strongly dependent on the model structure. MESSAGE-MACRO, 
  LDNE, and MARIA are dynamic optimization-type models that incorporate detailed 
  supply-side technologies; once a constraint on CO<sub>2</sub> emission or concentration 
  is imposed, the optimal set of technology and/or policy measures (focusing on 
  energy supply) is automatically selected in the model. AIM and IMAGE are recursive 
  simulation-type models which integrate physical and land-use modules rather 
  than focus on energy demand, so that highly detailed technology and/or policy 
  measures are assumed for each region and time as exogenous scenarios. ASF, MiniCAM, 
  PETRO, and WorldScan are other types of integrated models focusing on the economics 
  of energy systems. In these models, only a carbon tax is used for the post-SRES 
  analyses.</p>
<p>In order to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHG emissions, each modelling team 
  assumed specific technology and/or policy measures for its scenario quantification. 
  The main reduction measures are: <br>
<ul>
  <li> demand reductions and/or efficiency improvements; <br>
  <li> substitution among fossil fuels;<br>
  <li> switch to nuclear energy;<br>
  <li> switch to biomass;<br>
  <li> switch to other renewables;<br>
  <li> CO<sub>2</sub> scrubbing and removal; and <br>
  <li> afforestation. 
</ul>
<p><a href="#tab27">Table 2.7</a> summarizes the contribution of these emission 
  mitigation options and/or measures for the post-SRES scenarios. The table shows 
  the emission reduction (in GtC) between the baseline and the mitigation and/or 
  stabilization cases, corresponding to the first six points of the list above. 
  For simplicity, the total ranges as well as the median value in 2100 are shown 
  only for the 550ppmv stabilization case. As shown in <a href="#tab27">Table 
  2.7</a>, no single source will be sufficient to stabilize atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations. Across the scenarios, the contributions of demand reduction, 
  substitution among fossil fuels, and switching to renewable energy are all relatively 
  large. The contributions of nuclear energy, of CO<sub>2</sub> scrubbing and 
  removal differ significantly among the models and also across the post-SRES 
  scenarios.</p>

<p>With respect to the role of biofuels, it should be noted that the models assume

  supply never exceeds 400EJ/yr; this is possible because the other options (solar 
  and/or wind, nuclear, and CO<sub>2</sub> removal and storage) also play a key 
  role in mitigation strategies. <a href="#tab28">Table 2.8</a> shows the ranges

<p>To contribute to a synthesis of findings, each modelling team was asked to 
  respond to the following questions about the policy implications of the scenarios:<br>
<ul>
  <li> How do technology and/or policy measures vary among different baselines 
    for a given stabilization level? <br>
  <li> How does the stabilization level affect the technology and/or policy measures 
    used in the scenarios?<br>
  <li> What packages of technology and/or policy measures are robust enough to 
    beeffected in the different baseline worlds? 
</ul>
<p>As shown in <a href="#tab27">Table 2.7</a>, high emission worlds such as A1FI, 
  A2, and A1B require a larger introduction of energy demand reduction, switching 
  to renewable energy, and substitution among fossil fuels, in comparison to other 
  SRES worlds. The contribution of CO<sub>2</sub> scrubbing and removal is largest 
  in the A1FI stabilization scenarios, while mitigation measures in the A1T world 
  depend mainly on a switch to nuclear power as well as carbon scrubbing and removal. 
  Biomass energy steadily contributes across the SRES worlds and also across stabilization 
  targets.</p>
<p>The following summarizes more detailed differences in technology and/or policy 
  measures across the regions as well as the different SRES worlds:<br>
<ul>
  <li> The timing and the pace of the emissions reduction are particularly influenced 
    by the region&#146;s resource availability. Regions with large amounts of 
    cheap fossil fuel reserves and resources (ASIA: coal; EFSU: natural gas) rely 
    comparatively longer on fossil fuel-based power generation. In the long run 
    the emissions mitigation measures are predominantly the result of the technology 
    assumptions consistent with the scenario storylines. In the fossil-intensive 
    A2 scenario, emissions reduction for 2100 in ASIA and EFSU are mainly a result 
    of shifts to advanced fossil technologies in combination with carbon scrubbing 
    and/or removal and increasing shares of solar-photovoltaic, and advanced nuclear 
    technologies. For the B2 scenario, the shift towards non-fossil fuels in ASIA 
    and EFSU is more complete, and hence, scrubbing plays a less important role. 
    In A2 and B2, synthetic fuel production from biomass plays a key role in the 
    ALM region. In both scenarios the emissions mitigation in the OECD region 
    is because of shifts to wind, solar-photovoltaic, biomass, and nuclear technologies. 
    In the OECD, fossil fuels contribute roughly 30% to the power generation, 
    which comes predominantly from fuel cells (MESSAGE-MACRO team: Riahi and Roehrl, 
    2000);<br>
  <li> In the 550ppmv cases, the composition of primary energy is diversified, 
    with increased shares of various renewable energy sources, nuclear power, 
    and natural gas. Among the renewable energy sources, photovoltaics (PV) seem 
    to be the most promising abatement measure in the A1 and A2 scenarios, where 
    the final energy demands grow quite substantially, while CO<sub>2</sub> recovery 
    and disposal measures play a very important role in the B1 and B2 scenarios. 
    In the case of A1B and A2, PV would increase rapidly especially in the Middle 
    East and North Africa (ALM) where PV panels could be set in wide desert areas. 
    For the entire SRES world, methanol would be made from hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) 
    and carbon monoxide (CO) through gas splitting mainly in the Former Soviet 
    Union and Eastern Europe (EFSU) where there are plenty of natural gas resources. 
    Wind energy production would play an important role in North America (LDNE 
    team: Yamaji <i>et al.</i>, 2000);<br>
  <li> In the A1B and A1T worlds, expansion of biomass utilization is the major 
    strategy, rather than nuclear power, for carbon emission control in OECD and 
    EFSU. In the latter, biomass mainly substitutes for natural gas in public 
    and other sectors, and a shift from coal to natural gas in the industry sector 
    is also observed. Nuclear power is mainly used in the Asia-Pacific and ALM 
    regions. In contrast, the B1 scenarios give very similar figures among regions, 
    except for a small increase of biomass in the OECD region. Carbon sequestration 
    is implemented in all regions for the purpose of carbon emission control. 
    B2 scenarios are basically similar to those of the A1 family, except that 
    nuclear energy and biomass are introduced in the OECD region (MARIA team: 
    Mori, 2000);<br>
  <li> In the A1 and B1 families, technology transfer to developing countries 
    would occur with respect to renewable energy production, unconventional oil 
    and gas exploitation, and nuclear power generation. In these worlds, there 
    would be a large increase in biomass use in the Asia and ALM regions. Coal 
    is mainly produced in the Asia-Pacific region. Nuclear technology is widely 
    used in developing regions. In the A2 and B2 worlds, energy supply and use 
    heavily depend on local energy resources because of international trade barriers. 
    The Asia-Pacific region will rely on nuclear energy and coal, while ALM may 
    use much renewable energy. The OECD region makes much use of advanced end-use 
    technology and modern renewable energy technologies. Large gas resources in 
    the EFSU region can satisfy much of the energy demand in that region (AIM 
    team: Jiang <i>et al.</i>, 2000);<br>
  <li> The allocation of carbon &#147;taxes&#148; across regions based on their 
    per capita GDP levels leads to substantial differences in levels of CO<sub>2</sub> 
    reductions relative to the baseline. The largest relative reductions are implemented 
    in regions with relatively high per capita GDP growth (e.g., OECD) and regions 
    with a relatively low cost of renewable energy (Latin America). The lowest 
    relative reductions are achieved in regions with low per capita GDP and a 
    relatively high cost of renewable energy (e.g., Africa) (ASF team: Sankovski 
    <i>et al.</i>, 2000); and<br>
  <li> Assuming that there are no constraints on fuel trade, the Middle East and 
    later the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) will still be major fossil 
    fuel exporters; their revenues may decline significantly by the middle of 
    the 21<sup>st</sup> century as a consequence of carbon mitigation measures. 
    Parts of Africa and South America may develop into important biofuel exporters. 
    High-income regions with limited fossil fuel resources, such as Europe and 
    the USA, will probably be among the first to introduce high-efficiency and 
    non-carbon technologies. This results over time in sizeable cost reductions, 
    enabling less industrialized regions to replace their indigenous coal use 
    by these relatively capital-intensive supply side options. 
</ul>
<p>One of the major results of the post-SRES analyses is the identification of 
  &#147;robust climate policy options&#148; across the different SRES worlds as 
  well as across different stabilization targets. Most of the modelling teams 
  have identified several such options based on their simulations. The following 
  list summarizes the major findings: <br>
<ul>
  <li> Robust policies include technological efficiency improvements for both 
    energy use technology and energy supply technology, social efficiency improvements 
    such as public transport introduction, dematerialization promoted by lifestyle 
    changes and the introduction of recycling systems, and renewable energy incentives 
    through the introduction of energy price incentives such as a carbon tax (AIM, 
    IMAGE, MARIA, MiniCAM (Pitcher, 2000), PETRO (Kverndokk <i>et al.</i>, 2000), and 
    WorldScan teams);<br>
  <li> It would be reasonable to start with energy conservation and reforestation 
    to cope with global warming. However, innovative supply-side technologies 
    will eventually be required to achieve stabilization of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
    concentration (AIM, ASF, IMAGE, and LDNE teams);<br>
  <li> Robust options across the SRES worlds are natural gas and the use of biomass 
    resources. Innovative transitional strategies of using natural gas as a &#147;bridge&#148; 
    towards a carbon-free hydrogen economy (including CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration) 
    are at a premium in a possible future world with low emissions (MESSAGE-MACRO, 
    AIM, MARIA, and MiniCAM teams);<br>
  <li> In all mitigation scenarios, gas combined-cycle technology bridges the 
    transition to more advanced fossil (fuel) and zero-carbon technologies. The 
    future electricity sector is not dominated by any single dominant technology, 
    however, hydrogen fuel cells are assumed to be the most promising technology 
    among all stabilization cases (MESSAGE-MACRO, IMAGE, and MiniCAM teams);<br>
  <li> Climate stabilization requires the introduction of natural gas and biomass 
    energy in the first half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and either nuclear 
    energy or carbon removal and storage in the latter half of the century as 
    the cost effective pathways. Carbon removal and storage has a role to play 
    in high emission worlds such as A1FI and A1B for the serious or moderate targets 
    (LDNE, MiniCAM, and MARIA teams);<br>
  <li> Even in the B1 world there are very difficult decisions to be made and 
    these may well imply the need to significantly further redirect the energy 
    system (MiniCAM and WorldScan teams); and<br>
  <li> Energy systems would still be dependent on fossil fuels at more than 20% 
    of total primary energy over the next century, even with the stabilization 
    of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (LDNE and WorldScan teams). 
</ul>
<p>The post-SRES analyses supplied several other findings from individual model 
  simulations. The AIM and the MESSAGE-MACRO teams as well as other teams found 
  that technological progress plays a very important role in stabilization, and 
  that knowledge transfer to developing countries is a key issue in facilitating 
  their participation in early CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction. With respect 
  to policy integration, the AIM team found that integration between climate policies 
  and domestic policies could effectively reduce GHGs in developing regions from 
  their baselines, especially for the next two or three decades. On the other 
  hand, the MESSAGE-MACRO team estimated that regional air pollution control with 
  respect to sulphur emissions tends to: (1) amplify global climate change in 
  the medium-term perspective, and (2) accelerate the shift towards less carbon 
  (and sulphur) intensive fuels such as renewables. The MiniCAM team concluded 
  that agriculture and land use and energy system controls need to be linked, 
  and that failure to do this can lead to much larger than necessary costs.</p>
<p>The above results are found with robust technology and/or policy measures across 
  the SRES worlds and across different stabilization targets, and many of them 
  are common among different modelling teams. A part of these common results can 
  be tested by more detailed analyses of emission reduction sources, shown in 
  <a href="#tab27">Table 2.7</a>. This table as well as time series analyses of 
  the contribution of sources clearly show that:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Large and continuous energy efficiency improvements are common features 
    of mitigation scenarios in all the different SRES worlds; <br>
  <li> Introduction of low-carbon energy is also a common feature of all scenarios, 
    especially biomass energy introduction over the next one hundred years and 
    natural gas introduction in the first half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century;<br>
  <li> Solar energy and other renewable energy sources could play an important 
    role in climate stabilization in the latter half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, 
    especially for higher emission baselines or lower stabilization levels; and<br>
  <li> Mitigation scenarios with reduced fossil fuel use will further decrease 
    regional sulphur emissions and hence open up the possibility of earlier and 
    larger climate change effects.
