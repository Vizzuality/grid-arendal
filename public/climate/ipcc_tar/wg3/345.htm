<h4>8.3.2.3 Effects of Possible Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
  (OPEC) Response </h4>
<p>In the preceding discussion, a competitive equilibrium in the world economy 
  was assumed. However, OPEC may be able to exercise a degree of monopoly power 
  over the supply of oil. The issue has been raised in the literature as to the 
  possible nature of an OPEC response to reduced demand for oil as a result of 
  Annex I abatement. If in the short term OPEC were to reduce production to maintain 
  prices in the face of lower demand, the time path for Annex I carbon taxes may 
  need to be modified. See also <a href="353.htm">Chapter 9.</a></p>
<p>A number of theoretical papers examined how a carbon tax might alter the optimal 
  timing of extraction of given reserves of oil and, symmetrically, how significantly 
  the potential supply response could alter the optimal time path of the price 
  of carbon tax (Sinclair, 1992; Ulph and Ulph, 1994; Farzin and Tahovonen, 1996; 
  Hoel and Kverndokk, 1996; Tahvonen, 1997). However, the severity of the potential 
  problem depends on a number of key parameter values and implementation issues. 
  Although it has been assumed that OPEC can &#147;Granger cause&#148; the world 
  price of oil (G&uuml;llen, 1996), there is some question about the degree of 
  cartel discipline that could be maintained in the face of falling demand (Berg 
  <i>et al.,</i> 1997a). Any breakdown in the cartel would tend to increase the 
  supply of oil on the market, which in the short term may require a higher carbon 
  tax to meet a given abatement target. On the other hand, Br&aring;ten and Golombek 
  (1998) suggest that implementing an Annex I climate change agreement might be 
  seen by OPEC members as a hostile act and could strengthen the resolve to maintain 
  cartel discipline. The OPEC response is likely to be related to the size of 
  its potential loss in revenue to OPEC and these potential losses would be smaller 
  under Annex I emissions trading than under independent abatement.</p>
<p>A number of empirical studies have tried to assess the significance of the 
  potential OPEC response within a game theoretic framework. To do so, Berg <i>et 
  al.</i> (1997b) resorted to a Cournot&#150;Nash dynamic game in which parameter 
  values are based on empirical estimates. They also identify (non-OPEC) &#147;fringe&#148; 
  oil producers and other fossil fuel sources. A scenario is examined in which 
  a carbon tax is maintained at a level of US$10 per barrel of oil. Initially, 
  OPEC cuts back on production to try to maintain price, but this is partly offset 
  by increased production by the fringe. Br&aring;ten and Golombek (1998) derive 
  a similar pattern of OPEC response in a static model. Berg <i>et al.</i> (1997b) 
  found that the optimal OPEC policy is not heavily influenced by intertemporal 
  optimization in shifting supplies from one time period to another to maximize 
  discounted net revenue.</p>
<p>If OPEC acts as a cartel, the extent of emissions leakage in response to Annex 
  I abatement may be reduced (Berg <i>et al., </i>1997b), because the resultant 
  higher price for oil reduces the incentives for increased emission-intensive 
  activity in non-Annex I regions. Lindholt (1999) examined the Kyoto Protocol 
  in an enhanced version of the same model and assumed that an efficient tradable 
  permit scheme is established between Annex B countries. Whether or not OPEC 
  acts as a cartel does not affect the shape of the time path of permit prices, 
  only their level according to Lindholt (1999). A permit price of US$14/tCO<sub>2</sub> 
  would be required in 2010 if OPEC acts as a cartel, whereas it would be US$24/tCO<sub>2</sub> 
  in a competitive oil market. The lower permit price when OPEC acts as a cartel 
  stems from OPEC cutting back production to maintain a higher oil price, which 
  slows the growth in emissions in Annex B countries.</p>
<p>These studies mentioned demonstrate that whether or not OPEC acts a cartel 
  will have a modest effect on the loss of wealth to OPEC and other oil producers 
  and the level of permit prices in Annex B regions. A natural extension of this 
  research would be to trace through all the ramifications of cartel behaviour 
  by OPEC in the more complex CGE models discussed in this section.</p>
<h4><a name="8324"></a>8.3.2.4 Technological Transfers and Positive Spillovers</h4>
<p>In a dynamic context, a progressive outward shift in the production possibilities 
  frontier occurs over time as a result of technical change. A strand of literature 
  (Goulder and Schneider, 1999) argues that climate policies will bias technical 
  change towards emissions savings. In that case, there will be an outwards shift 
  in the production possibilities frontier at some points, and an inwards shift 
  at other points relative to the baseline. </p>
<p>One potentially important related issue not captured in the above models is 
  that cleaner technologies, developed in response to abatement measures in industrialized 
  countries, tend to diffuse internationally. The question is to what extent this 
  will offset the negative aspects of leakage noted above and to amplify positive 
  spillover. Grubb (2000) presents a simplified model, which represents this spillover 
  effect in terms of its impact on emissions per unit GDP (intensities). The results 
  suggest that, because the impact of cleaner technologies is cumulative and global, 
  this effect tends to dominate over time, provided the connection between industrialized 
  and developing country emission intensities is significant (higher than 0.1 
  on a scale where 0 represents an absence of connection and 1 a complete convergence 
  of intensities by 2100). At this stage, empirical analysis is still lacking 
  to derive a robust conclusion from this result. A recent work by Mielnik and 
  Goldemberg (2000) suggests that the potential for technological leap-frogging 
  in developing countries is important, but to what extent climate mitigation 
  in Annex B accelerates this leap-frogging is still unclear. However, this demonstrates 
  that the trickling down of technical change across countries deserves more attention 
  in modelling exercises, all the more so since theoretically it (see <a href="379.htm">Chapter 
  10</a> of this report) demonstrates that technological spillovers may be a major 
  stabilizing force of any climate coalition.</p>
