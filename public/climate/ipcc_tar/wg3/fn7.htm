<p><b><sup><a name="1"></a>1</sup></b> Other issues that may need to be considered 
  include incomplete information, perceptual biases, and learning.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="2"></a>2</sup></b> Indeed, many of the comments on earlier 
  drafts of this chapter took different positions on this issue.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="3"></a>3</sup></b> For some impacts, such as those on "sustainability", 
  the selection of physical indicators is also a matter of controversy.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="4"></a>4</sup></b> Various additional interrelationships are 
  omitted from this graphic. An example is that estimated health benefits might 
  be lower if a GHG mitigation policy reduces temperature increases, thereby creating 
  less ozone (O<sub>3</sub>).<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="5"></a>5</sup></b> See Burtraw <i>et al</i>. (1999) and reviews by 
  Burtraw and Toman (1997), Ekins (1996), and Pearce (2000).<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="6"></a>6</sup></b> A major study in the early 1990s considered 
  externalities throughout various fuel cycles for electricity generation in the 
  USA. It concluded that of the highest-valued endpoints (among many specifically 
  defined endpoints) were fatalities associated with the rail transport of coal 
  and damage to roadway surfaces beyond those internalized in road fees (Lee <i>et al</i>., 1995).<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="7"></a>7</sup></b> It is also useful to display graphically 
  the time path of undiscounted costs, as discounting can obscure important information.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="8"></a>8</sup></b> For a very readable account of the basic 
  analytics and economic intuition at the heart of this literature, see pages 
  281-284 in Kolstad (2000).<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="9"></a>9</sup></b> See, for example, Parry <i>et al</i>. (1999).<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="10"></a>10</sup></b> The environmental policy should yield 
  environmental benefits, including some non-market benefits. A cost-benefit analysis 
  of the proposed policy compares these benefits with the estimated cost of the 
  policy.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup> <a name="11"></a>11</sup></b> The term "strong double dividend" has 
  been used in the literature for cases in which the revenue-recycling effect 
  not only exceeds the interaction effect but also the direct (GDP) costs of reducing 
  emissions, thus making revenue-generating environmental policy costless. A revenue-recycling 
  effect this large presupposes that the original tax structure is seriously inefficient 
  (e.g., that capital is highly overtaxed relative to labour). This in itself 
  calls for a tax reform the benefits of which should not be ascribed to the introduction 
  of a revenue-generating environmental policy, even if the two were made on one 
  and the same occasion (see SAR, Chapter 11). In this perspective, the term "strong 
  (or weak) double dividend" becomes redundant (see also <a href="319.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>).<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="12"></a>12</sup></b> Uncertainty that is relevant to cost estimation 
  arises from three sources. First, the intrinsic uncertainty of the climate system, 
  second uncertainty about the impacts, and third uncertainty about the costs. 
  This section only deals with the last of these. The broader issues are discussed 
  in the crosscutting paper devoted exclusively to this topic (Moss and Schneider, 
  2000).<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="13"></a>13</sup></b> To some extent DES impacts overlap with 
  ancillary impacts. Examples are reductions in air pollution, changes in employment, 
  etc. The concept of DES is, however, wider than that of ancillary benefits, 
  covering issues of long-term equity, social and economic development, and sustainability.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="14"></a>14</sup></b> A study that summarizes the macroeconomic 
  level costs of alternative climate change policies in Germany and the USA, including 
  the employment impacts, is Jochem <i>et al</i>. (2000).<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="15"></a><sup>15</sup></b> It remains true, however, that if the 
  system is optimally designed, the marginal costs of different fiscal instruments 
  will be equalized.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="16"></a>16</sup></b> Account must also be taken of any divergence 
  between the market price and the social value of the output derived from the 
  labour, both in its pre-project stage and as a result of the project (for details, 
  see Ray, 1984).<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="17"></a>17</sup></b> Note that this method implies a social 
  benefit for the employment that is likely to be much less than the product of 
  the average earnings and hours worked.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="18"></a>18</sup></b> Verikios and Hanlow (1999) illustrate 
  in a comparative static framework how the welfare impacts of international capital 
  mobility can be assessed using decomposition analysis.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="19"></a>19</sup></b> One reviewer has pointed out that different 
  values of e may be appropriate for costs and benefits.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="20"></a>20</sup></b> The parameter from which the weights are 
  derived is called the elasticity of the marginal utility of income. The greater 
  this elasticity, the greater the weight given to the WTP of poor households.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="21"></a>21</sup></b> As defined by the Articles 6, 12, and 
  17 of the Kyoto Protocol, these studies include JI between Annex I parties, 
  CDM between Annex I and non-Annex I parties, and emissions trading between Annex 
  I parties. See the discussions about these mechanisms in <a href="224.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="22"></a>22</sup></b> Carbon-reduction projects are projects 
  supplied by the potential host countries, where the policy is to be implemented.
