<h4>10.1.4.3 Tolerable Windows and Safe Landing Approaches </h4>
<p>Considerable work since the SAR has explored the implications for global emissions 
  of GHGs of a set of constraints on a variety of associated phenomena. This vein 
  of research is referred to as the tolerable windows and/or safe landing (TWSL) 
  approach. See, for example, Alcamo and Kreileman (1996a, 1996b) and Swart <i>et al</i>. (1998) for early work on the safe landing approach and Toth <i>et al</i>. (1997) 
  for early work on the tolerable windows approach. The approach seeks to limit 
  the emissions time-paths with implications for the near term and long term. 
  While the tolerable windows and safe landing analyses differ somewhat in the 
  detail of their implementation, they are similar in approach. We consider the 
  safe landing approach first. In a multimodel exercise four constraints on emissions 
  trajectories are considered: temperature change since 1990, maximum decadal 
  rate of temperature change, sea level rise between 1990 and 2100, and maximum 
  rate of sea level change. In addition, a limit on the rate of reduction of emissions 
  is set.</p>

<p>The safe landing interval is the range of emissions, given in CO<sub>2</sub>

  1990 emissions were 7.10GtC, and approximately 9.8GtC<sub>eq</sub>, equivalent, 
  defined in terms of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O only 
  (Pitcher, 1999). Emissions for Annex I nations can be derived by subtracting

<p>Results from the analysis depend strongly on the constraints and model sensitivities. 
  The tolerable windows approach (Toth <i>et al</i>., 1997, 1999; Bruckner <i>et al</i>., 1999; 
  Petschel-Held <i>et al</i>., 1999) is formulated as a type of extended and generalized 
  cost&#150;benefit analysis for which two kinds of normative inputs are required. 
  First, with the help of climate-impact response functions that depict reactions 
  of climate-sensitive socioeconomic and natural systems to climate change forcing, 
  social actors can specify their willingness to accept a certain amount of climate 
  change in their own jurisdiction. Second, the same social actors reveal their 
  willingness to pay for climate change mitigation in terms of acceptable burden-sharing 
  principles and implementation schemes internationally, as well as in terms of 
  tolerable utility, consumption, or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) loss in their 
  own jurisdiction. An integrated climate-economy model (e.g., Integrated Assessment 
  of Climate Protection Strategies - ICLIPS) can then determine whether there 
  exists a corridor of emission paths over time that keeps the climate system 
  within the permitted domain.</p>

<p>If the corridor does not exist, a willingness to accept 
  more climate change can be specified (e.g., as a result of resource transfers 
  to increase the adaptive capacity in the most constraining region or sector 
  on the impact side). Alternatively, willingness to pay for emission reductions 
  can be increased or more cost-reducing flexibility instruments can be allowed 
  on the mitigation side. If the corridor does exist, it can be perceived as the 
  room to manoeuvre for global climate policy over the long term. The tolerable 
  windows approach leaves the specification of climate-change mitigation regimes 
  up to decision makers involved in climate-change policy making at the global 
  and national levels. The primary goal of the ICLIPS integrated assessment model 
  (IAM) is to determine the implications of different equity principles in burden 
  sharing and of various implementation mechanisms on the existence and shape 
  of the emission corridor. Nevertheless, the model can also produce cost-effective 
  emission paths.</p>
<p>The German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) proposed two climate change 
  constraints based on geohistorical arguments: the tolerable magnitude of climate 
  change is set to 2&deg;C compared to the pre-industrial era<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#4","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>4</sup></small></a> 
  and the rate of temperature increase should not exceed 0.2 &deg;C per decade. 
  On the cost side, it is assumed that to reduce GHG emissions at a rate faster 
  than 4%/yr would be economically too painful to implement. These constraints 
  are used to illustrate the application of the tolerable windows approach. The 
  results presented here are based on an extended atmospheric chemistry&#150;climate 
  model. In addition to CO<sub>2</sub>, the model also includes CH<sub>4</sub>, 
  N<sub>2</sub>O, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and aerosols. One simplifying assumption 
  is that all GHG emissions are reduced at the same rate, except for CFCs, which 
  follow the IPCC IS92a scenario paths. For simplicity, energy-related global 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are presented in <a href="#fig104">Figure 10.4</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#fig104">Figure 10.4</a>(a) presents the basic emission corridor for 
  the WBGU window. It follows from the mathematical formulation of the model that 
  at least one permitted emission path passes through any arbitrary point in the 
  corridor. However, not every arbitrary path within the corridor is necessarily 
  a permitted path. If emissions follow the upper boundary of the corridor in 
  the first few decades after 1995, for example, this would entail a sharp turnaround 
  and persistent emission reductions at the maximum annual rate (4%/yr) for many 
  decades to come.</p>
<p>How do near-term emissions affect the available flexibility over the long-term? 
  The scenario presented in <a href="#fig104">Figure 10.4</a>(b) shows this. Here 
  it is assumed simply that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions follow the baseline path 
  according to the IPCC IS92a scenario until 2010. The result is a much narrower 
  corridor: it implies that the likelihood of a fast turnaround of emissions and 
  persistent reductions at relatively higher rates (3%&#150;4%/yr) is significantly 
  higher.</p>
<p>The next analysis illustrates the implications of a fairness principle for 
  the Annex I emission corridor. The assumption is that GHG emissions by non-Annex 
  I countries follow the baseline path and these countries start emission reductions 
  only when their per capita emissions reach those of Annex I levels on the basis 
  of their 1992 populations. The resultant Annex I corridor is presented in <a href="#fig104">Figure 
  10.4</a>(c). Obviously, the result is a relatively narrow corridor.</p>
<p><a href="#fig104">Figure 10.4</a>(d) shows the resultant emission corridor 
  if the above two assumptions about future emissions are combined. This implies 
  that the world community follows the baseline emission path until 2010 and reduction 
  obligations will be distributed between the Annex I and non-Annex I countries 
  according to the case in <a href="#fig104">Figure 10.4</a>(c). The result for 
  Annex I countries emissions through the first half of the 21st century looks 
  like a straightjacket rather than an emission corridor with ample choice.</p>
<p>Importantly, Annex I corridors in <a href="#fig104">Figures 10.4</a>(c) and 
  <a href="#fig104">10.4</a>(d) reflect the rigid implementation of emission quotas 
  that result from the specified equity principle. No cost divergence is considered 
  between Annex I and non-Annex I. The difference between <a href="#fig104">Figures 
  10.4</a>(a) and <a href="#fig104">10.4</a>(c) corridors indicates the potential 
  to reduce abatement costs if Annex I countries are allowed to &#147;buy&#148; 
  part of the non-Annex I corridor. The economic value of this transaction is 
  the subject of many detailed energy-economy models (see <a href="432.htm">Section 
  10.4</a>).</p>
  It is clear that all these emission corridors are associated with the global 
  climate window as specified by the Council. It is beyond the scope of this analysis 
  to discuss arguments for and against whether the 2&deg;C increase in global 
  mean temperature above the pre-industrial level and the rate of temperature 
  increase at no more than 0.2&deg;C per decade are preferred or realistic propositions. 
  The objective for the tolerable windows approach is to provide an assessment 
  framework that can help test any climate protection proposal formulated through 
  selected climate attributes. The computed emission corridors, nevertheless, 
  can assist in deciding the magnitude and urgency of the policy measures associated 
  with them, and/or trigger rethinking the originally proposed climate change 
  targets. The presented example also shows how equity concerns can be analyzed 
  in the tolerable windows approach, albeit in a terse form.<br>
