<h4>5.4.7.2 Programmes and Policies to Remove Barriers</h4>
<p>To overcome the barriers and to exploit the opportunities in waste management, 
  it is necessary to have a multi-pronged approach which includes the following 
  components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building up of database on availability of wastes, their characteristics, 
    distribution, accessibility, current practices of utilization and/or disposal 
    technologies and their economic viability;</li>
  <li>An institutional mechanism for technology transfer though a co-ordinated 
    programme involving the R&amp;D institutions, financing agencies, and industry 
    (Schwarz, 1997); and </li>
  <li>Defining the role of stakeholders including local authorities, individual 
    house holders, NGOs, industries, R&amp;D institutions, and the government.</li>
</ul>
<p>The efforts of local authorities in waste management could focus on: the separation 
  and reclamation of wastes through seperate collection of reusable wastes for 
  recovery; provision of reclamation centres where the public can deliver wastes; 
  arrangements for separation and reclamation at disposal sites and transfer stations 
  (de Uribarri, 1998); arrangements for waste disposal with by-product recovery; 
  and landfilling of residuals. Local authorities may enlist the support of the 
  public and individual householders as well as NGOs to store recoverable wastes 
  separately or deliver these to the reclamation centres. Local authorities can 
  also consult the industry on how wastes could be best ultilized to meet their 
  raw material requirement. Industry can be encouraged to accept wastes as secondary 
  raw materials (NWMC, 1990).</p>
<p>R&amp;D institutions could play an important role in waste utilization by development 
  and dissemination of viable technological alternatives including pilot scale 
  demonstration, organizing technology transfer workshops, and dissemination of 
  information to industries. Land use and industrial estate planners can internalize 
  waste utilization and/or minimization concerns in the process of siting industrial 
  plants (Datta, 1999). The possibilities of siting industrial activities in such 
  a way that wastes from one unit could be used as raw material for another could 
  be explored. The arrangement might reduce capital outlay and operating costs, 
  and also facilitate transfer and processing of products and/or raw materials.</p>
<p>Governments may introduce fiscal and regulatory measures for reduction of wastes 
  and promotion of waste utilization. These may include incentives to producers 
  and users to accept reduced packaging, incentives to consumers to return reclaimable 
  wastes, incentives to local authorities to support reclamation and/or waste 
  utilization activities, incentives to industries using recovered materials, 
  financial support to R&amp;D activities, awards to individuals and/or organizations 
  for waste utilization, and penalties for not adopting waste minimization and/or 
  utilization practices.</p>
<p>Programmes for providing training and education on waste minimization and utilization 
  with an interdisciplinary approach could be developed. Waste utilization as 
  a profession has no fixed boundaries. Skills of psychology, economics, material 
  sciences, process design, and ecology are but some of the many requirements 
  for the trained professional.</p>
<p>Even the best planned, designed, and executed waste utilization programme would 
  fail without the effective participation of the public. Education of the public 
  on waste utilization issues, therefore, would play a vital role in ensuring 
  the success of the programme. A public education programme would be aided by 
  the identification of appropriate communication systems (AIT, 1997; ESCAP, 1997; 
  Bhide, 1998).</p>
