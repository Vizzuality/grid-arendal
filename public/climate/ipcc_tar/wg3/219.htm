<h2>5.5 Regional Aspects </h2>
<p>There are many barriers and opportunities, from the ones described before, 
  which have a particular relevance to developing countries and EITs. The issues 
  of sustainable and equitable development resonate in these countries as they 
  undergo a rapid transformation towards market-oriented systems that are immersed 
  in a global economy. Institutionally, the transformation in developing countries 
  is significant, but it is often confined to specific sectors, such as the deregulation 
  of the energy sector. On the other hand, the socialist economies are undergoing 
  a more radical shift of the whole economy. These global patterns of change provide 
  an opportunity for introducing GHG mitigation technologies and practices that 
  are consistent with DES goals. At the macro-level the change to a market economy 
  and the liberalization and opening of markets to foreign investment provides 
  an opportunity to make significant improvements in the GHG intensity of the 
  economy. Similarly, the restructuring of the energy sectors also offers an opportunity 
  to introduce demand management and low or no GHG-emitting energy sources. As 
  the sections below note, however, a culture of energy subsidies, institutional 
  intertia, fragmented capital markets, vested interests, etc. presents major 
  barriers to the introduction of such technologies and practices. The developed 
  countries face different types of barriers and opportunities that prevent or 
  slow the penetration of GHG mitigation technologies. These barriers and opportunities 
  are related to their more affluent lifestyles. The sections below emphasize 
  situations in the three groups of countries that call for a more careful consideration 
  of the barriers and opportunities they face.</p>
<h3><a name="551"></a>5.5.1 Developing Countries</h3>
<p>As a group, the developing countries are undergoing rapid urbanization, which 
  leads to increased industrialization and motorization that has altered the manner 
  in which people relate to their environment (Rabinovitch, 1992). Much of their 
  technology stock is derived from developed countries, and increased globalization 
  tends to expose even remote populations to socio-cultural patterns observed 
  in the developed countries. Yet, the majority of the population in these countries 
  lives in rural areas, and often in absolute poverty. These underlying attributes 
  and phenomena create or emphasize barriers and opportunities that are particular 
  to this group of countries. </p>
<p><i>Trade and Environment </i><br>
  A larger external debt and balance-of-payments (BoP) deficit is a reality in 
  many developing countries. If a GHG mitigation technology has to be imported, 
  it is likely to add to this debt and BoP deficit. Another barrier to the technology 
  transfer process is the requirement in technology transfer contracts of &#147;intellectual 
  property rights&#148; (IPR), which guarantee that private firms are compensated 
  for sharing their technology. If IPR laws are not effectively enforced, there 
  is little incentive for private firms to share their technology. However, patents 
  and licensing fees can be very expensive and in such situations, developing 
  countries may prefer the lowest priced, albeit possibly less efficient technology 
  alternatives (Srivastava and Dadhich, 1999).</p>
<p><i>Institutional Framework </i><br>
  Deregulation and privatization offer an opportunity for improving energy efficiency 
  and reducing GHG emissions in the energy sector. Studies and scenario analyses 
  show, however, a consequent increase in emissions resulting from low fuel prices, 
  displacement of hydro and nuclear plants by cheaper fossil-fired capacity, and 
  a change in attitudes and behaviour of the energy suppliers (Bouille, 1999).</p>
<p><i>Distorted Energy Prices</i><b> </b><br>
  Energy price subsidies have been in place in many developing countries in the 
  name of reducing the financial burden on the poor. This has spawned a culture 
  of dependency on energy subsidies that is gradually diminishing (Jochem, 1999). 
</p>
<p><i>Finance</i><b> </b><br>
  Lack of available capital and lack of finance at low interest rates is pervasive 
  in developing countries. Together with the absence of standards or energy labeling 
  schemes, these barriers support the proliferation of inefficient equipment and 
  first-cost-minimization philosophy. Additionally, low incomes and poverty constrain 
  access to adequate finance, and oblige the purchase of inexpensive and often 
  GHG-intensive equipment (Bouille, 1999). Provision of special funds targeted 
  to the poor and government financing of the first cost of equipment are ways 
  to increase the provision of energy services.</p>
<p><i>Barriers</i><br>
  Information gap hindering proper technology selection, lack of adaptation and 
  absorption capability, lack of access to state of the art technology, and the 
  small scale of many projects (Jochem, 1999) are specific and important barriers 
  in low income developing countries to effectively exploit the full potential 
  benefit of technology transfer. Lack of information also slows the decision-making 
  processes in developing countries. <br>
