<h4>8.2.2.2.4 Free Allocation of Emissions Permits </h4>
<p>Annex B countries are currently considering the creation of a market for GHG 
  emissions on the basis of grandfathered quotas or of quotas delivered in function 
  of voluntary agreements of sectors to given emissions targets (see <a href="224.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>). This option does not generate revenue, but (contrary to tax exemptions) 
  implies participation of the carbon-intensive industry to climate policy and 
  does not transfer the full burden to households and the rest of industry. However, 
  the welfare impacts are systematically found to be less favourable than under 
  a full revenue-neutral taxation. Jensen (1998) found a welfare loss of 1.4% 
  in Denmark and a permit price of US$110/tCO<sub>2</sub>, while a uniform tax 
  to meet the same &#150;20% target is only US$40 and the resultant welfare loss 
  is 1.2%. Bye and Nyborg (1999) investigated the effects on welfare (total discounted 
  utility) of both uniform taxes and tradable permits issued freely compared to 
  the current system of tax exemptions. To keep total tax revenues unchanged for 
  the government, the payroll tax is adjusted accordingly. They found that a permit 
  system gives a welfare loss of 0.03% compared to the current system, while with 
  uniform taxes there is a gain of similar size. The main reason is that payroll 
  taxes must increase to maintain the budget balance when carbon taxes are not 
  used. There are similar findings for the USA. Parry <i>et al.</i> (1999) show 
  that the net economic impact (after accounting for environmental benefits but 
  not without climate benefits) of carbon abatement is positive when permits are 
  auctioned, but switches to negative when permits are grandfathered.</p>
<p>Other allocation rules have been tested, but do not improve the result compared 
  with grandfathered permits. For Denmark, Jensen and Rasmussen (1998) examined 
  the aggregate welfare loss (equivalent variation) of an emission target of 80% 
  of 1990 levels from 1999 to 2040; they found 0.1% with a permit auction, 2.0% 
  for grandfathered permits, and 2.1% when the permits are given to firms in the 
  proportion of market shares and sectoral emissions, similar to an output subsidy.</p>
<p>Such results are obtained because, in the case of free delivered permits, the 
  interactions with the tax system occur without the compensating effect of tax-revenue 
  recycled, as in the cases of environmental taxes and auctioned permits. Studies 
  by Parry (1997), Goulder <i>et al</i>. (1997), Parry <i>et al.</i> (1999), and 
  Goulder <i>et al. </i>(1999) show that the costs of quotas or marketable permits 
  are higher if there are prior taxes on the production factors concerned than 
  in if there are no such taxes. Quotas or permits tend indeed to raise the costs 
  of production and the prices of output. This reduces the real return to labour 
  and capital, and thereby exacerbates prior distortions in relevant markets and 
  decrease the overall efficiency of the economy.</p>
<p>Bovenberg and Goulder (2001) found that avoiding adverse impacts on the profits 
  and equity values in fossil fuel industries involves a relatively small efficiency 
  cost for the economy. This arises because CO<sub>2</sub> abatement policies 
  have the potential to generate revenues that are very large relative to the 
  potential loss of profit for these industries. By enabling firms to retain only 
  a very small fraction of these potential revenues, the government can protect 
  the firms&#146; profit and equity values. Thus, the government needs to grandfather 
  only a small percentage of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions permits or, similarly, must 
  exempt only a small fraction of emissions from the base of a carbon tax. This 
  policy involves a small sacrifice of potential government revenue. Such revenue 
  has an efficiency value because it can finance cuts in pre-existing distortionary 
  taxes. These authors also found a very large difference between preserving firms&#146; 
  profits and preserving their tax payments. Offsetting producers&#146; carbon 
  tax payments on a dollar-for-dollar basis (through cuts in corporate tax rates, 
  for example) substantially overcompensates firms, raising their profit and equity 
  values significantly relative to the situation prior to the environmental regulation. 
  This reflects that producers shift onto consumers most of the burden from a 
  carbon tax. The efficiency costs of such policies are far greater than the costs 
  of policies that do not overcompensate firms.</p>
<h4><a name="82225"></a>8.2.2.2.5 Conclusions</h4>
<p>The costs of meeting the Kyoto targets are very sensitive to the type of recycling 
  used for the revenue of carbon taxes or auctioned permits. In general, however, 
  modelling results show that the sum of the positive revenue-recycling effect 
  and the negative tax-interaction effect of a carbon tax or auctioned emission 
  permits is roughly zero. Thus, in some analyses the sum is positive, while in 
  others it is negative. In economies with an especially distortive tax system 
  (as in several European analyses), the sum may be positive and hence confirm 
  the strong double-dividend hypothesis. In economies with fewer distortions, 
  such as in various models of the US economy, the sum is negative. Another conclusion 
  is that even with no strong double-dividend effect, a country fares considerably 
  better with a revenue-recycling policy than with one that is not revenue recycling, 
  like grandfathered quotas. Analyses of the US economy found that revenue recycling 
  reduces the cost of regulation by about 30%&#150;50% for a certain range of 
  targets, while European analyses report cost savings that are even higher than 
  100%.</p>
<p>However, at this stage insufficient evidence exists either to confirm or to 
  substantiate these results in the context of developing countries. Studies to 
  date have concentrated on developed countries and, while these studies are comprehensive 
  and rigorous, their conclusions may not be directly transferable. It can be 
  argued that, in developing countries, direct welfare losses typically associated 
  with specific factor taxes (such as a carbon tax) may have fewer opportunities 
  for mitigation within the fiscal-reform policy envelope. Nevertheless, the complex 
  linkages between formal and informal sectors of the economy may show this intuition 
  to be incorrect; the only existing study for China reviewed here suggests that 
  this may be the case but further research is needed to confirm this more generally.<br>
