<h2>3.4 Transport and Mobility</h2>
<a name="341"></a>
<h3>3.4.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>This section addresses recent patterns and trends in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
  by the transport sector, and the technological and economic potential to reduce 
  GHG emissions. The chapter focuses on areas where important developments have 
  occurred since the SAR. It does not attempt to comprehensively present mitigation 
  options for transport, as was done there (Michaelis <i>et al</i>., 1996). For a discussion 
  of barriers and market potential with respect to advanced transportation technologies, 
  the reader is referred to <a href="179.htm">Chapter 5</a>, especially <a href="208.htm">Section 5.4.2</a>. For a discussion 
  of policies, measures and options, including behavioural strategies, the reader 
  is referred to <a href="224.htm">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<p>Recent successes with key future technologies for motor vehicles such as fuel 
  cell power trains and advanced controls for air pollutants (carbon monoxide, 
  hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter) seem to promise dramatic 
  changes in the way the transport sector uses energy and in its impacts on the 
  environment. At the same time, the rapid motorization of transport around the 
  world, the continued availability of low-cost liquid fossil fuels, and the recent 
  trend of essentially constant fuel economy levels caused by demand for larger, 
  more powerful vehicles, all point towards steadily increasing GHG emissions 
  from transport in the near future (e.g., WEC, 1998a; Ogawa <i>et al</i>., 1998). These 
  are challenges that must be met by the evolution of policies and institutions 
  capable of managing environmentally beneficial change in an increasingly global 
  economy.</p>

<h3>3.4.2 Summary of the Second Assessment Report</h3>
<p>The SAR&#146;s chapter 21, Mitigation Options in the Transportation Sector 
  (Michaelis <i>et al</i>., 1996), provides an overview of global trends in transportation 
  activity, energy intensities, and GHG emissions, along with a comprehensive 
  review of economic, behavioural, and technological options for curtailing GHG 
  emissions from the global transport sector. It concludes with an assessment 
  of transport policies and their effects on GHG emissions. Its review of mitigation 
  options for transportation demand management, modal structure, and alternative 
  fuels, and its analysis of transport policies are still essentially up to date 
  and are not repeated in this section. </p>
<p>Historically, transportation energy use and GHG emissions have increased because 
  reductions in energy intensities have not kept pace with increasing transport 
  activity. The world&#146;s motor vehicle fleet grew at an average annual rate 
  of 4.5% from 1970 to 1990. Over the same period, light-duty vehicle fuel economy 
  improved by 2% per year or less. Increases in vehicular fuel economy have also 
  been accompanied by declining vehicle occupancy rates. It is noted below that 
  the fuel economy of road passenger transport vehicles has levelled off since 
  the publication of the SAR, and no longer appears to be improving. Air travel 
  and truck freight activity have also grown more rapidly than energy intensities 
  (energy use per passenger km) have declined. Since 1970, transport energy use 
  and GHG emissions have grown at an average annual rate of 2.4%.</p>
<p>The SAR concluded that by 2010 it might be technically feasible to reduce energy 
  intensities for new transport vehicles by 25% to 50% without reduction of performance 
  or quality, by adopting a variety of fuel economy technologies. It noted that 
  the economic potential would likely be smaller. The adoption of energy efficiency 
  improvements throughout the sector was estimated to be able to reduce transportation 
  energy use in 2025 by one-third versus projected levels.</p>
<p>The SAR also extensively reviewed the life cycle GHG emissions from alternative 
  fuels and concluded that only fuels derived from biomass or electricity generated 
  from substantially non-fossil sources could reduce life cycle GHG emissions 
  by more than 20% versus conventional gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles. 
  Compressed or liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases are capable 
  of reducing full fuel cycle GHG emissions by 10% to 20% over gasoline-powered 
  light-duty vehicles, but emissions would actually increase if these fuels were 
  used to replace diesel engines in heavy-duty vehicles.</p>
