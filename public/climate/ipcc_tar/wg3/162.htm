    <td class="box"><b>Box 4.3. The Reduced Impact Logging Project, Carbon Sequestration 
      Through Reduced Impact Logging </b> 
      <p>The RIL (reduced impact logging) project developed by Innoprise, a Malaysian 
        company with forestry activities, and the New England Power Company, USA, 
        aims to save CO<sub>2</sub> already stored in forest biomass by reducing 
        damage to vegetation and soils during harvesting. The hope is to reduce 
        damage by 50% compared to that of conventional harvesting. The techniques 
        employed are modifications of conventional bulldozer harvesting techniques; 
        including pre-felling climber cutting, directional felling, skid trail 
        design, and post harvest operations such as rehabilitation of log landings. 
        Today the total project area amounts to 2,400 ha. The pilot research project 
        has quantified the carbon implications and costs on 1,415ha. They found 
        that avoided emissions amounted to 65&#150;90MgC/ha and that the associated 
        costs were US$3.55/MgC (Wan Razali and Tay, 2000).</p>

<p><a name="box43"></a>The concept of &#147;forest disturbance&#148; refers to 
  events such as forest fire, harvesting, wind-throw, insect and disease outbreak 
  (epidemics), and forest flooding that cause large pulses of CO<sub>2</sub> to 
  be released into the atmosphere through combustion or decomposition of resulting 
  dead organic matter. Stand-replacing disturbances, such as crown fires and wind-throw, 
  are associated with the sudden death of large cohorts of trees near one another 
  (Pickett and White, 1985; Kurz <i>et al</i>., 1995a, 1995b; Kurz and Apps, 1999, see 
  <a href="161.htm#box42">Box 4.2</a>). Some disturbance agents, such as pollution 
  and some insects and disease outbreaks, may result in large areas with productivity 
  decline but only local mortality (Hall and Moody, 1994). Disturbances play an 
  important natural part in the lifecycle and succession dynamics of many forest 
  systems. In boreal systems large-scale, natural, stochastic forces tend to dominate 
  the ecosystem dynamics, even when direct human influences are considered (Kurz 
  <i>et al</i>., 1995b). The return interval of these disturbances, their intensity, 
  and their specific impacts are referred to as the disturbance regime (Weber 
  and Flanigan, 1997). Kurz <i>et al</i>. (1995b) and Price <i>et al</i>. (1998) (having compiled 
  insect, fire, and harvest data) showed that the disturbance regime of Canadian 
  forests changed over the last quarter of the 20th century from about 2.5Mha/yr 
  prior to 1970 to 4Mha/yr between 1970 and 1990. Using these data, Kurz and Apps 
  (1999) showed that these changes in the disturbance regime resulted in a switch 
  of Canadian forests from being a net sink of C to a small net source of C to 
  the atmosphere. </p>
Disturbances, both human-induced and natural, are major driving forces that determine 
the transition of forest stands, landscapes, and regions from carbon sink to source 
and back. The current pattern of forest vegetation and its role in carbon cycling 
reflects the combined effects of anthropogenic and natural disturbances over a 
range of time scales. For C stocks with very slow turnover rates (such as soils 
and peat) the effects of past disturbances on carbon cycling may reverberate for 
centuries and millennia (<a href="162.htm#fig45">Figure 4.5</a>). For example, 
carbon continues to accumulate in young soils (such as those associated with the 
isostatic uplift following deglaciation in Canada and Finland), which appear to 
be actively accruing carbon (Harden <i>et al</i>., 1992). In these soils, losses from 
decomposition of accumulated organic matter are exceeded by the inputs of fresh 
organic debris (Liski <i>et al</i>., 1999). Human influences on the disturbance regime 
include both direct effects, such as harvesting or inducing and/or suppressing 
natural disturbances (fires, insects, flooding, etc.), and indirect influences 
from altering the forest environment. Indirect influences include both climate 
change and atmospheric pollution, and their effects on tree health and survival.

      <p><b>Figure 4.5:</b> Conceptual model of soil organic matter decomposition 
        and accumulation following disturbance (after Johnson, 1995; IPCC, 2000a). 
        At steady state (I), carbon (C) inputs from litter (L) equal C losses 
        via decomposition (D) (i.e., L/D = 1). After a disturbance, D often exceeds 
        L resulting in loss of C (II), until a new, lower steady state is reached 
        (III). Adoption of new management, where L exceeds D results in a re-accumulation 
        of C (IV) until a new, higher steady state is reached (V). The eventual 
        steady state (A, B, or C) depends on the new management adopted.</p>

<p>The different types of disturbances are often linked. For example, in some 
  forest types the probability of fire may increase following insect outbreaks 
  because of increases in available fuel (litter). In some cases salvage logging 
  (recovering the usable timber following a disturbance) can reduce the total 
  area of living forest that is disturbed in a given year by all agents combined. 
  It is common to try to replace natural disturbances (such as wildfires) with 
  commercial harvesting, using a combination of protection and scheduled logging. 
  In Sweden and Finland, for example, logging has become the main disturbance 
  type; and large-scale natural disturbances resulting from wildfire, insect outbreaks, 
  or storms have been almost non-existent for half a century (L&auml;hde <i>et al</i>., 
  1999).</p>
<p>Disturbances affect the carbon stocks of all components of forested ecosystems. 
  During and following a disturbance, carbon is transferred from living material, 
  above and below ground, to the dead organic matter pools (<a href="158.htm#fig42">Figure 
  4.2</a>). In the case of a forest fire, part of the ecosystem carbon is released 
  immediately into the atmosphere as combustion products. Disturbed forest stands 
  continue to release carbon into the atmosphere as the enlarged pools of dead 
  organic matter tend towards a new steady-state condition (Bhatti <i>et al</i>., 2001). 
  Regrowth follows, but maximum uptake may not be achieved for some time (decades 
  or more), and during much of this period decomposition of dead organic matter 
  may exceed vegetative uptake. The corresponding re-sequestration of carbon through 
  regrowth can last 50 to 200 years or more.</p>
<p>Management of natural disturbance regimes can provide significant C mitigation 
  opportunities, e.g., through activities to prevent or suppress disturbances. 
  Such measures can significantly enhance the strength of C sinks (Kurz <i>et al</i>., 
  1995a; Apps <i>et al</i>., 2000; Bhatti <i>et al</i>., 2001) and maintain existing C stocks, 
  but only as long as the programmes are maintained. Other factors being equal, 
  during periods of reduced disturbance (e.g., with increasing suppression effort), 
  C stocks tend to increase as biomass accumulates and litter production (in all 
  forms) increases: forests act as a sink for atmospheric C (Bhatti <i>et al</i>., 2001). 
  In contrast, with increasing disturbance (e.g., with reduction in suppression 
  effort), the net losses of C from forest ecosystems can exceed inputs from photosynthesis 
  (<a href="158.htm#fig42">Figures 4.2</a> and <a href="158.htm#fig43">4.3</a>) 
  and the forests could become a net source of C. We note that all forms of disturbance, 
  not just highly visible fires, play a role in these dynamics. In a changing 
  climate, the control of new pathogens and immigrant herbivores (especially insects 
  and disease), to which local forest ecosystems may be maladapted, may be critical 
  to avoid emissions and maintain existing forest C stocks. </p>
<p>Disturbances affect the carbon stocks in vegetation, in soil, and in dead organic 
  matter. All these stocks vary over time as a function of the history of disturbances 
  (MacLaren, 1996; Bhatti <i>et al</i>., 2001; Kurz and Apps, 1999). With an increase 
  of widespread disturbance events the carbon stocks of living vegetation decrease 
  and the age-class distribution of the forest shifts to younger stands containing 
  less carbon. If forests are disturbed at regular intervals (i.e., an unchanging, 
  disturbance regime), the carbon stock of large tracts of forest can be relatively 
  stable. </p>
