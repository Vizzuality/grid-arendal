<h3><a name="424"></a>4.2.4 Changes in Global Climate and Other Indirect Human 
  Effects </h3>
<p>Evaluating the long-term outcome of carbon mitigation activities will require 
  estimating how carbon reservoirs will change in the future. Carbon stocks sequestered 
  through mitigation activities today may be more or less secure, depending on 
  how the environment changes and how society adapts to those changes. Estimating 
  future C stocks in ecosystems is complicated by our inability to predict the 
  magnitude and impact of impending changes in the environment. Some of the possible 
  changes favour larger C stocks; others would lead to smaller stocks. The impact 
  of global climate change on future C stocks is particularly complex. These changes 
  may result in both positive and negative feedbacks on C stocks (Houghton <i>et al</i>., 1998). For example, increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> are known to 
  stimulate plant yields, either directly or via enhanced water-use efficiency, 
  and thereby to enhance the amount of C added to soils (Schimel, 1995; Woodwell 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998). Higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations may also suppress decomposition 
  of stored C, because C/N ratios in residues may increase and because more C 
  may be allocated below ground (Owensby, 1993; Morgan <i>et al</i>., 1994; Van Ginkel 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996; Torbert <i>et al</i>., 1997). Predicting the long-term influence of elevated 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on the C stocks of forest ecosystems remains a 
  research challenge (Bolin <i>et al</i>., 2000; Prentice <i>et al</i>., 2001).</p>
<p>Where plant growth is now limited by nitrogen (N) deficiencies, increased deposition 
  of N associated with intensified production of bio-available N (Schindler and 
  Bayley, 1993; Vitousek <i>et al</i>., 1997) may accelerate plant growth. This may, 
  eventually, enhance the carbon stock of the soil (Wedin and Tilman 1996). Nadelhoffer 
  <i>et al</i>. (1999) caution, however, that the global impact of N deposition may be 
  comparatively small. Moreover, where the N fertilization effect increases growth, 
  especially in the N-deficient northern forests, it also delays the hardening-off 
  process, resulting in increased winter damage, and thus negating some of the 
  growth enhancement (Makipaa <i>et al</i>., 1999). </p>
<p>Increased soil temperatures associated with increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  have long been expected to result in increased soil respiration (Schimel, 1995; 
  Townsend and Rastetter, 1996; Woodwell <i>et al</i>., 1998). Data recently reported 
  by Giardina and Ryan (2000), however, suggest that decomposition of organic 
  carbon in mineral soil layers is relatively insensitive to changes in air temperature. 
  Modelling studies by Liski <i>et al</i>. (1998) suggest similar results. Nevertheless, 
  IPCC reviews (Bolin <i>et al</i>., 2000; Prentice <i>et al</i>., 2001) conclude that existing 
  terrestrial C sinks may gradually diminish over time, in part because of increasing 
  losses via respiration.<br>
  <br>
  Over the long term, as climate gradually changes, the time scales for adaptation 
  of ecosystems to climatic conditions will become important. Vegetation types 
  (and other organisms) have adapted to the combination of site conditions, including 
  climate, where they now occur. It cannot be assumed that tree growth will increase 
  with climate change, or that the plant populations will remain optimally adapted 
  to their current sites. Analysis of provenance (seed source) data, in the light 
  of global change, indicates either no net increase in growth rate as a result 
  of warming or small decreases in growth rate. Trees may be under more stress 
  in a changed climate, leaving them more susceptible to insects and diseases.</p>

      <p><b>Figure 4.6:</b> Cumulative carbon changes for a scenario involving 
        afforestation and harvest. These are net changes in that, for example, 
        the diagram shows savings in fossil fuel emissions with respect to an 
        alternative scenario that uses fossil fuels and alternative, more energy-intensive 
        products to provide the same services (adapted from Marland and Schlamadinger, 
        1999).</p>

<p><a name="fig46"></a>The various processes of environmental change may occur 
  over different time periods and with varying intensity at different locations. 
  Ecosystems that initially absorb C in response to higher atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  will become &#147;saturated&#148; or even later release CO<sub>2</sub> if increasing 
  temperatures lead to enhanced decomposition and respiration (Cao and Woodward, 
  1998; Scholes <i>et al</i>., 1999). Fires and other disturbances could increase in 
  frequency and intensity if temperatures increase and precipitation patterns 
  change. The net impact of these, and other global changes, is an area of active 
  research (e.g., Hungate <i>et al</i>., 1997; Kauppi <i>et al</i>., 1997; Norby and Cotrufo, 
  1998; Woodwell <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
The effects of climate change on mitigation activities in the terrestrial biosphere 
are difficult to anticipate, as they are dependent on the timing and the specific 
spatial character and distribution of changes. Present climate scenarios are neither 
spatially nor temporally very precise, and averages over the scale of typical 
global circulation climate models are inadequate for estimating impacts on very 
specific, localized mitigation activities. Moreover, the responses of ecosystems 
are dependent on the ecological mechanisms, the climate change imposed, and the 
management responses to these factors. For example, planting of species adapted 
to present conditions may be inappropriate for future conditions and the species 
might grow more slowly under chronic climate change. Conversely, species planted 
for an anticipated future climate may not be able to survive current variations. 
<p>Climate change can also affect the economic and social dimensions of land use 
  and forestry. Currently, productive lands may become less productive and less 
  attractive for food and fibre production. The current patterns of land use and 
  disturbance could change. Model results reported by Darwin <i>et al</i>. (1995, 1996) 
  and others suggest, for example, that conversion from forestland to cropland 
  is a significant adaptive response to climate change in some regions. Protection 
  from fire or insect and/or disease predation, in boreal regions especially, 
  may become increasingly hard to maintain. Reliable estimates of risks to, or 
  enhancements of, mitigation activities carried out today will require increased 
  understanding of the interactions between the important ecological, economic, 
  and social impacts of climate change. As described in this chapter, the carbon 
  stocks in terrestrial ecosystems respond to a combination of ecological, economic, 
  and social drivers. That will not change even if the global environment changes.</p>
