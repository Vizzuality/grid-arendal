<h4>10.3.3.2.2 Mechanisms for Technology Transfer </h4>
<p>Technology intermediaries are needed to reduce barriers to technology transfer 
  associated with information, management, technology, and financing. These operate 
  between users and suppliers of technology and help to create links within networks 
  and systems (through bridging between institutions), and encourage interaction 
  between the system. They also assist with undertaking research, evaluation, 
  and dissemination tasks. ODA programs mechanisms for technology transfer under 
  the UNFCCC, and multilateral development banks (MDBs) can play a significant 
  role in strengthening national institutional and organizational structures for 
  technological development and innovation.</p>
<p>The 1990s have seen broad changes in the types and magnitude of international 
  financial flows that drive technology transfer (IPCC, 2000a; French, 1998). 
  ODA decreased and fell below the committed levels (OECD, 1999a). However, it 
  plays an important role in technology transfer, especially for the sectors and 
  areas that are commercially less attractive to FDI, such as forestry, public 
  health, agriculture, and coastal zone management (OECD, 1997). Moreover, ODA 
  is still critical for the poorest countries, particularly when it is aimed at 
  development capacities to acquire, adapt, and use foreign technologies.</p>
<p>MDBs have become aware of the role they can play in helping to mobilize private 
  capital to meet the needs of sustainable development and the environment, and 
  of the potential to use financial innovation to encourage environmental projects 
  and initiatives. The World Bank has developed a number of initiatives with potential 
  support for environmental technology transfer. An important new initiative is 
  the Carbon Investment Fund, which will provide additional finance for CO<sub>2</sub> 
  mitigating projects in return for carbon offsets. Other MDBs, such as the regional 
  development banks in Africa, Asia, Latin American, and the Caribbean region, 
  can also play an important role in developing systematic approaches to create 
  enabling environments for technology transfer, including South&#150;South technology 
  transfer.</p>
<p>The Global Environment Facility (GEF), the financial mechanisms of the UNFCCC, 
  is a key multilateral institution for the transfer of ESTs (Anderson, 1997). 
  Although this is of a modest scale in terms of total investment and mainstream 
  investment flows, GEF-supported projects are especially significant for renewable 
  energy technologies, such as wind, solar thermal, solar photovoltaic home systems, 
  and geothermal<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn10.htm#20","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>20</sup></small></a>.</p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, in particular the project based Joint Implementation 
  (JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), can increase technology transfer. 
  CDM and JI can provide financial incentives for ESTs and influence technology 
  choice. As voluntary mechanisms, they require co-operation among developed and 
  between developed and developing country parties, as well as between governments, 
  private sector entities, and community organizations. Project-based crediting 
  can lead to tangible investments and to the development of local capacity to 
  maintain the performance of these investments. These investments could incrementally 
  assist developing countries to achieve multiple sustainable development objectives, 
  such as economic development, improvement of local environmental quality, minimization 
  of risk to human health by local pollutants, and reduction of GHGs. Much about 
  the design and governance of the CDM, however, remains to be resolved. There 
  is a need to design simple, unambiguous rules that ensure environmental performance 
  in the context of sustainable development, while also favouring investment. 
  The multilateral oversight and governance provisions of the CDM, and the project-basis 
  transactions, will raise the transaction cost of investment in CDM projects 
  as compared to the cost of mitigation through other means. <a href="224.htm">Chapter 
  6</a> discusses these aspects in more detail.</p>
