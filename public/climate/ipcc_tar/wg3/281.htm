<h3>7.2.5 Discounting </h3>
<p>The debate on discount rates is a long-standing one. As SAR notes (IPCC, 1996a, 
  Chapter 4), there are two approaches to discounting; an ethical, or prescriptive, 
  approach based on what rates of discount should be applied, and a descriptive 
  approach based on what rates of discount people (savers as well as investors) 
  actually apply in their day-to-day decisions. SAR notes that the former lead 
  to relatively low rates of discount (around 2%&#150;33% in real terms) and the 
  latter to relatively higher rates (at least 6% and, in some cases, very much 
  higher rates). </p>
<p>The ethical approach applies the so-called social rate of time discount, which 
  is the sum of the rate of pure time-preference and the rate of increase of welfare 
  derived from higher per capita incomes in the future. The descriptive approach 
  takes into consideration the market rate of return to investments, whereby conceptually 
  funds can be invested in projects that earn such returns, with the proceeds 
  being used to increase the consumption for future generations. Portney and Weyant 
  (1999) provide a good overview of the literature on the issue of intergenerational 
  equity and discounting. </p>
<p>For climate change the assessment of mitigation programmes and the analysis 
  of impacts caused by climate change need to be distinguished. The choice of 
  discount rates applied in cost assessment should depend on whether the perspective 
  taken is the social or private case. The issues involved in the application 
  of discount rates in this context are addressed below.</p>
<p>For mitigation effects, the country must base its decisions at least partly 
  on discount rates that reflect the opportunity cost of capital. In developed 
  countries rates around 4%&#150;6% are probably justified. Rates of this level 
  are in fact used for the appraisal of public sector projects in the European 
  Union (EU) (Watts, 1999). In developing countries the rate could be as high 
  as 10%&#150;12%. The international banks use these rates, for example, in appraising 
  investment projects in developing countries. It is more of a challenge, therefore, 
  to argue that climate change mitigation projects should face different rates, 
  unless the mitigation project is of very long duration. These rates do not reflect 
  private rates of return, which typically need to be considerably higher to justify 
  the project, potentially between 10% and 25%.</p>
<p>For climate change impacts, the long-term nature of the problem is the key 
  issue. The benefits of reduced GHG emissions vary with the time of emissions 
  reduction, with the atmospheric GHG concentration at the reduction time, and 
  with the total GHG concentrations more than 100 years after the emissions reduction. 
  These are very difficult to assess.</p>
<p>Any &#147;realistic&#148; discount rate used to discount the impacts of increased 
  climate change impacts would render the damages, which occur over long periods 
  of time, very small. With a horizon of around 200 years, a discount rate of 
  4% implies that damages of US$1 at the end the period are valued at 0.04 cents 
  today. At 8% the same damages are worth 0.00002 cents today. Hence, at discount 
  rates in this range the damages associated with climate change become very small 
  and even disappear (Cline, 1993). </p>
<p>A separate issue is that of the discount rate to be applied to carbon. In a 
  mitigation cost study, should reductions of GHG in the future be valued less 
  than reductions today? It could argued that this is the case, as the impacts 
  of future reductions will be less. This is especially true of &#147;sink&#148; 
  projects, some of which will yield carbon benefits well into the future. Most 
  estimates of the cost of reductions in GHGs do not, however apply a discount 
  rate to the carbon changes. Instead, they simply take the average amount of 
  carbon stored or reduced over the project lifetime (referred to as flow summation) 
  or take the amount of carbon stored or reduced per year (flow summation divided 
  by the number of years). Both these methods are inferior to the application 
  of a discount rate to allow for the greater benefit of present reductions over 
  future reductions. The actual value, however remains a matter of disagreement, 
  but the case for anything more than a very low rate is hard to make (Boscolo 
  <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>More recent analysis on discounting now examines rates that vary with the time 
  period considered. In surveys of individual trade-offs over time, Cropper <i>et al</i>. (1994) estimated a nominal rate of around 16.8%, based on a sophisticated 
  questionnaire approach to valuing present versus future risks. Most importantly, 
  however, these authors found evidence that respondents do not discount future 
  lives saved at a constant exponential rate of discount. Rather, median rates 
  seem to be decline over time (i.e., a rate is not constant over time but decreases 
  as the time horizon lengthens). Using different econometric specifications that 
  allow the discount rate to decline over time, Cropper <i>et al</i>. (1994) estimate 
  that mean discount rates are greater for short time periods relative to long 
  time horizons. For example, fitting their data to a hyperbolic function suggests 
  that mean discount rate is 0.80 for 1 year and 0.08 for 100 years. While the 
  pattern is consistent, the implied rates using linear discount rate functions 
  are much larger: 34% for the initial period and about 12% for the last period. 
</p>
<p>Hyperbolic discounting implies that a person&#146;s relative evaluation of 
  two payments depends on both the delay between the two payments and when this 
  delay will occur&#150;sooner or later. For instance, people often have an impulsive 
  preference for immediate reward. Some people prefer to receive US$1000 today 
  over US$1010 in a month&#146;s time, and yet they also prefer US$1010 in 21 
  months to US$1000 in 20 months, even though both choices involve a month&#146;s 
  wait to obtain $10 more (see Lowenstein and Prelec, 1992). Theoretical support 
  for hyperbolic discount rests on the idea that, while interest rates from financial 
  instruments can be used to identify appropriate discount rates for time horizons 
  of a few decades, they do not apply to future interest rates for far distant 
  horizons. These will be determined by future opportunity sets created by many 
  factors, such as economic growth. The fact that the scope of these future opportunity 
  sets for the far distant future is not known adds another layer of uncertainty 
  into climate policy, which tends to drive discount rates down. </p>
<p>Weitzman (1998) surveyed 1700 professional economists and found that (a) economists 
  believe that lower rates should be applied to problems with long time horizons, 
  such as that being discussed here, and (b) they distinguish between the immediate 
  and, step by step, the far distant future. The discount rate implied by the 
  analysis falls progressively, from 4% to 0%, as the perspective shifts from 
  the immediate (up to 5 years hence) to the far distant future (beyond 300 years). 
  Weitzman (1998) suggests the appropriate discount rate for long-lived projects 
  is less than 2%. Finally, hyperbolic discounting has less support if it leads 
  to time-inconsistent planning, as argued by Cropper and Laibson (1999). Time 
  inconsistency arises when a policymaker has an incentive to deviate from a plan 
  made with another person, say in the future, even when no new information has 
  emerged. Policymakers of today try to commit future policymakers to a development 
  path that is sustainable. But when the future actually arrives, these new policymakers 
  deviate from the sustainable path and reallocate resources that are efficiently 
  based on prevailing interest rates. </p>
<p>Finally the case is made for calculating all intertemporal effects with more 
  than one rate. The arguments outlined above for different rates are unlikely 
  to be resolved, given that they have been an issue since well before climate 
  change. Hence it is good practice to calculate the costs for more than one rate 
  to provide the policymaker with some guidance on how sensitive the results are 
  to the choice of discount rate.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
  A lower rate based on the ethical considerations is, as noted above, around 
  3%.</p>
