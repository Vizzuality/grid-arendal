<h3>7.2.6 Adaptation and Mitigation Costs and the Linkages between Them </h3>
<p>Climate change puts society at risk. It is possible to prevent damages through 
  mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation strategies against the risks of climate 
  include curtailing GHG emissions to lower the likelihood that worse states of 
  nature will occur. Adaptation strategies to climate risk include the changing 
  of production and consumption decisions to reduce the severity of a worse state 
  in the scenario if it does occur (Ehrlich and Becker, 1972; Crocker and Shogren, 
  1999). A portfolio of mitigation and adaptation actions jointly determines climate 
  risks and the costs of reducing them. Since individuals in their private capacity 
  have the liberty to undertake adaptation to climate change on their own accord, 
  modellers and policymakers need to address these adaptive responses when choosing 
  the optimal degree of public mitigation. If this is not the case, then policy 
  actions are likely to be more expensive than they need be, with no additional 
  reduction in climate risk (see, e.g., Schelling, 1992). <br>
  <br>
  While most people appreciate that actions on adaptation affect the costs of 
  mitigation, this obvious point is often not addressed in climate policymaking. 
  Policy is fragmented&#150;with mitigation being seen as addressing climate change 
  and adaptation seen as a means of reacting to natural hazards. As a consequence, 
  the estimated costs of each can be biased (see Kane and Shogren, 2000). Usually, 
  mitigation and adaptation are modelled separately as a necessary simplification 
  to gain traction on an immense and complex issue. One question that must be 
  addressed is &#147;How reasonable is this assumption?&#148; Another is &#147;What 
  are the likely consequences of this assumption on the estimated costs of mitigation?&#148;</p>
<p>First, separability presupposes that the overall effectiveness and costs of 
  mitigation do not depend on adaptation. However, for this assumption to hold, 
  the implicit presumption is that climate risk is exogenous&#150;a risk beyond 
  people&#146;s private or collective ability to reduce. The necessary economic 
  conditions for this to hold are rather restrictive. In particular, climate risk 
  can be considered as exogenous only if markets are complete. A complete set 
  of markets exists if people can contract to insure against all risks from each 
  conceivable state of nature that might be realized (Marshall, 1976). Complete 
  markets allow for perfect risk spreading and risk pooling such that the only 
  remaining risk is outside the control of human actions (e.g., phases of the 
  moon). However, markets for climate risk are notorious incomplete or non-existent 
  because of the high cost of contracting (Chichilnisky and Heal, 1993). People 
  make private and collective adaptation decisions through the markets that do 
  exist and through collective policy actions. The economic circumstances that 
  influence these choices matter to the level of risk, and addressing these conditions 
  is essential for the successful estimation of costs. People choose to create 
  and reduce risk. How people perceive risk, the relative costs and benefits of 
  alternative risk reduction strategies, and relative wealth affect these choices. 
</p>
<p>Similar to income and substitution effects, adaptation can have two effects 
  on the costs of mitigation. First, more adaptation can lower mitigation costs 
  because policymakers choose to move to another point on the same mitigation 
  cost curve - adaptation does not alter the marginal productivity of mitigation, 
  it induces a shift along the cost curbe. Second, adaptation acting as a technical 
  substitute or complement shifts the mitigation cost curve. For example, flood 
  defences change land use and thereby change costs and prices in an area, which 
  impacts on mitigation costs. Whether adaptation causes a shift along the mitigation 
  cost curve or a shift of the entire curve itself, or both, then becomes a modelling 
  question, and an empirical one to determine the magnitude of the shift along 
  and to a new cost curve.</p>
<p>Second, sectoral work in agriculture, forestry, and coastal areas shows that 
  cost estimates are sensitive to the inclusion of adaptation (see, e.g., Sohngen 
  and Mendelsohn, 1997; Sohngen <i>et al</i>., 1999). Greater climate variability, for 
  instance, can influence how adaptation affects mitigation in agriculture. Increased 
  levels of risk directly induce a nation to adapt more by switching its crop 
  mix and crop varieties to those more tolerant of drier or wetter conditions, 
  and by modifying its weed control strategies. The magnitude of this adaptation 
  depends on how risk affects the perceived marginal productivity of mitigation 
  (e.g., more or less effective soil sequestration per unit of area), and how 
  mitigation and adaptation work with or against each other. Bouzaher <i>et al</i>. (1995), 
  for example, estimate that winter cover crops can be used to increase soil organic 
  carbon by expanding annual biomass production. They also show that conservation 
  tillage, the Conservation Reserve Program, and the Wetlands Reserve Program 
  can increase soil carbon by minimizing soil disturbance and targetting bottomland 
  for hardwood trees. For non-climate risk, models that account for mitigation 
  and adaptation risk estimate that benefits are underestimated by 50% when adaptation 
  is ignored (e.g., Swallow, 1996). </p>
<p>Third, uncertainty in cost is affected by interaction of the technologies for 
  risk reduction&#150;mitigation and adaptation. By mitigation, humans reduce 
  the odds that a deleterious event happens; by adaptation, they reduce the consequences 
  when a damaging event actually does occur. For the most part, climate change 
  literature contains models that deal with mitigation and adaptation separately. 
  This is unfortunate, since significant interactions are likely to exist between 
  how people choose to mitigate and adapt (Shogren and Crocker, 1999). These risk-reduction 
  strategies probably complement or negate each other. Understanding the interaction 
  between the two can help formulate better the analysis of mitigation costs. 
  The benefits of mitigation will be lower if more people can adapt to the climate.</p>
<p>These results suggest that more it would be worthwhile to pay more attention 
  to the interaction of mitigation and adaptation, and its empirical ramification. 
  The challenge is to capture in a reasonable way the linkages between these sets 
  of actions, and to establish how this interaction can impact the estimated costs 
  of climate protection. Even if a complete empirical application of the portfolio 
  of risk avoidance is currently unreachable, an understanding of which unmeasured 
  links might be most valuable to decision makers in the future could indicate 
  whether the costs of mitigation are being underestimated.</p>
