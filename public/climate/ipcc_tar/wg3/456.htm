<p><b>Cap<br>
  </b><i>See</i><b><i> emissions cap.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Capital costs</b><br>
  Costs associated with capital or investment expenditure on land, plant, equipment, 
  and inventories. Unlike labour and operating costs, capital costs are independent 
  of the level of output for a given capacity of production.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Capacity building</b><br>
  In the context of <b><i>climate change</i></b>, capacity building is a process 
  of developing the technical skills and institutional capability in developing 
  countries and <b><i>Economies in transition</i></b> to enable them to participate 
  in all aspects of <i><b>adaptation</b></i> to, <i><b>mitigation</b></i> of, 
  and research on climate change, and the implementation of the <b><i>Kyoto Mechanisms</i></b>, 
  etc.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Carbon cycle</b><br>
  The term used to describe the flow of carbon in various forms (e.g., as <i><b>carbon 
  dioxide</b></i>) through the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial biosphere, and lithosphere.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</b><br>
  A naturally occurring gas, and also a by-product of burning <b><i>fossil fuels</i></b> 
  and <i><b>biomass</b></i>, as well as <b><i>land-use</i></b> changes and other 
  industrial processes. It is the principal anthropogenic <b><i>greenhouse gas</i></b> 
  that affects the earth&#146;s radiative balance. It is the reference gas against 
  which other greenhouse gases are measured and therefore has a <b><i>Global Warming 
  Potential</i></b> of 1.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Carbon dioxide fertilization<br>
  </b>The enhancement of the growth of plants as a result of increased atmospheric 
  carbon dioxide concentration. Depending on their mechanism of photosynthesis, 
  certain types of plants are more sensitive to changes in atmospheric carbon 
  dioxide concentration. In particular, plants that produce a three-carbon compound 
  (C<sub>3</sub>) during photosynthesis; including most trees and agricultural 
  crops such as rice, wheat, soybeans, potatoes and vegetables, generally show 
  a larger response than plants that produce a four-carbon compound (C<sub>4</sub>) 
  during photosynthesis; mainly of tropical origin, including grasses and the 
  agriculturally important crops maize, sugar cane, millet and sorghum.<br>

  </b><i>See</i><b><i> Clean Development Mechanism. </i></b></p>
<p><b>CER</b><br>
  <i>See<b> certified emission reduction.</b></i></p>
<p><b>Certified emission reduction (CER)</b><br>
  Equal to 1 tonne (metric ton) of <b><i>CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions</i></b> 
  reduced or sequestered through a <b><i>Clean Development Mechanism</i></b> project, 
  calculated using <b><i>Global Warming Potentials</i></b>. See also <i><b>emissions 
  reduction units</b></i>.</p>
<p><b>CFCs</b><br>
  <i>See <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b>.</i><br>
  <br>
  <b>CH<sub>4</sub></b><br>
  <i>See<b> methane.</b></i><br>
</p>
<p><b>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</b><br>
  <b><i>Greenhouse gases</i></b> covered under the 1987 Montreal Protocol and 
  used for refrigeration, air conditioning, packaging, insulation, solvents, or 
  aerosol propellants. Since they are not destroyed in the lower atmosphere, CFCs 
  drift into the upper atmosphere where, given suitable conditions, they break 
  down <i><b>ozone</b></i>. These gases are being replaced by other compounds, 
  including hydrochlorofluorocarbons and <i><b>hydrofluorocarbons</b></i>, which 
  are <i>greenhouse gases </i>covered under the <i><b>Kyoto Protocol</b></i>.</p>
<p><b>Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)</b><br>
  Defined in Article 12 of the <i><b>Kyoto Protocol</b></i>, the Clean Development 
  Mechanism is intended to meet two objectives: (1) to assist Parties not included 
  in Annex I in achieving sustainable development and in contributing to the ultimate 
  objective of the convention; and (2) to assist Parties included in Annex I in 
  achieving compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction 
  commitments. <b><i>Certified emission reductions</i></b> from Clean Development 
  Mechanism projects undertaken in <b><i>non-Annex I countries</i></b> that limit 
  or reduce <i><b>greenhouse gas emissions</b></i>, when certified by operational 
  entities designated by <b><i>Conference of the Parties/Meeting of the Parties</i></b>, 
  can be accrued to the investor (government or industry) from Parties in <i><b>Annex 
  B</b></i>. A share of the proceeds from the certified project activities is 
  used to cover administrative expenses as well as to assist developing country 
  Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of <b><i>climate 
  change</i></b> to meet the costs of <i><b>adaptation</b></i>.</p>
<p><b>Climate change</b><br>
  Climate change refers to a statistically significant variation in either the 
  mean state of the climate or in its variability, persisting for an extended 
  period (typically decades or longer). Climate change may result from natural 
  internal processes or external forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changes 
  in the composition of the atmosphere or in <b><i>land use</i></b>. Note that 
  <b> <i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</i></b>, in its 
  Article 1, defines &#147;climate change&#148; as &#147;a change of climate which 
  is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition 
  of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability 
  observed over comparable time periods&#148;. <i>United Nations Framework Convention 
  on Climate Change</i> thus makes a distinction between &#147;climate change&#148; 
  attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition, and &#147;climate 
  variability&#148; attributable to natural causes.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Climate Convention</b><br>
  <i>See</i><b><i> United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</i></b><br>
</p>
<p><b>CO<sub>2</sub></b><br>
  <i>See<b> carbon dioxide.</b></i><br>
</p>
<p><b>CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent</b><br>
  The concentration of <i><b>carbon dioxide</b></i> that would cause the same 
  amount of <i><b>radiative forcing</b></i> as the given mixture of carbon dioxide 
  and other <i><b>greenhouse gases</b></i>.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Co-benefits</b><br>
  The benefits of policies that are implemented for various reasons at the same 
  time &#150; including <b><i>climate change mitigation</i></b> &#150; acknowledging 
  that most policies designed to address <b><i>greenhouse gas mitigation</i></b> 
  also have other, often at least equally important, rationales (e.g., related 
  to objectives of development, sustainability, and equity). The term co-impact 
  is also used in a more generic sense to cover both the positive and negative 
  side of the benefits. See also <i><b>ancillary benefits</b></i>.</p>
<p><b>Co-generation<br>
  </b>The use of waste heat from electric generation, such as exhaust from gas 
  turbines, for either industrial purposes or district heating.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Commercialization</b> <br>
  Sequence of actions necessary to achieve market entry and general market competitiveness 
  of new technologies, processes, and products.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Compliance</b> <br>
  <i>See<b> implementation.</b></i><br>
</p>
<p><b>Conference of the Parties (CoP)</b><br>
  The supreme body of the <b><i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
  Change</i></b>, comprising countries that have ratified or acceded to the Framework 
  Convention on Climate Change. The first session of the <i>Conference of the 
  Parties</i> (CoP-1) was held in Berlin in 1995, followed by CoP-2 in Geneva 
  1996, CoP-3 in Kyoto 1997, CoP-4 in Buenos Aires, CoP-5 in Bonn, and CoP-6 in 
  The Hague. See also <i><b>CoP/MoP</b></i> and <b><i>Meeting of the Parties</i></b>.</p>
<p><b>Consumer surplus</b><br>
  A measure of the <i><b>value</b></i> of consumption beyond the price paid for 
  a good or service.<br>
  <br>
  <b>CoP <br>
  </b><i>See</i><b><i> Conference of the Parties.</i><br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>CoP/MoP<br>
  </b>The <b><i>Conference of the Parties</i></b> of the <b><i>United Nations 
  Framework Convention on Climate Change</i></b> will serve as the <b><i>Meeting 
  of the Parties (MoP)</i></b> the supreme body of the <i><b>Kyoto Protocol</b></i>, 
  but only Parties to the Kyoto Protocol may participate in deliberations and 
  make decisions. Until the Protocol enters into force, <i><b>MoP</b></i> cannot 
  meet.<b><br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>Cost-effective<br>
  </b>A criterion that specifies that a <i><b>technology</b></i> or measure delivers 
  a good or service at equal or lower cost than current practice, or the least-cost 
  alternative for the achievement of a given target.<b><br>
