<h4>5.4.2.1 Barriers to Mitigation </h4>
<p>IPCC (1996, Chapter 21) noted many reasons why GHG mitigation in the transport 
  sector has proved difficult. Transport activity is closely interwoven with infrastructure, 
  lifestyles, economic development, and patterns of industrial production. Partly 
  because of these complex links, experts do not always agree on the best mitigation 
  strategy. Climate change and energy saving is usually a minor factor in decisions 
  and policy in the sector, and mitigation strategies may not be implemented if 
  they seem to reduce the benefits provided by the transport system to individuals 
  and firms. Appropriate mixes of policies need to be designed for local situations. 
  And policies can be very slow to take effect because of the inertia of the infrastructure, 
  technologies, and practices associated with the existing transport system.</p>
<p>Stated preference surveys in the United States have shown that consumers would 
  prefer to purchase energy efficient cars, and would be prepared to pay US$400-600 
  for each litre/100km reduction in fuel consumption (Bunch <i>et al</i>., 1993; US DOE, 
  1995). This is about the amount that would be expected from the fuel savings 
  over the life of the car (Michaelis, 1996b). However, there is no evidence that 
  this valuation of fuel economy is reflected in the car market. There may be 
  several reasons. First, many vehicle purchasers have to work within budgets 
  set by the size of loan they can obtain to buy a car, and such budgets are likely 
  to be set independent of the amount they will have to spend on fuel. Where they 
  have a number of high priorities in their vehicle choice such as comfort, size, 
  safety, and performance, they will spend their budgets on those priorities rather 
  than on energy efficient technologies that increase vehicle price. Second, vehicle 
  manufacturers have no incentive to promote energy efficiency, and a strong interest 
  in selling more sports utility vehicles and mini-vans where their profit margins 
  are higher than for cars. The outcome can be viewed as a rational response to 
  consumer preferences subject to a budget constraint, but it has been repeatedly 
  noted in European government-industry discussions that marketing helps to shape 
  those preferences (Dietz and Stern, 1993; Michaelis, 1996a).</p>
<p>Cars may also provide a good example of the principal-agent barrier. The first 
  owner of a car may be more concerned with its status value and other aspects, 
  and less concerned with cost minimization than subsequent owners. Secondhand 
  owners&#146; preferences for cost minimization do appear to be reflected in 
  the secondhand car market, where more fuel efficient cars tend to be more expensive 
  (Daly and Mayer, 1983; Kahn, 1986), reflecting perhaps half to three quarters 
  of the value of fuel savings they will offer (Michaelis, 1996a). The lack of 
  control of vehicle users over technology is exacerbated by the concentration 
  of the global car industry in Annex I countries, and in a small number of transnational 
  companies (IPCC, 2000b).</p>
<p>While information on the fuel efficiency of vehicles is widely available, it 
  may not be easy to find or assimilate for the average purchaser. Labelling laws 
  and information programmes have been introduced in many countries to overcome 
  this information gap (ECMT, 1997). Nevertheless, the fuel economy information 
  on labels is usually obtained in standard test cycles, the information from 
  which may be inaccurate, underestimating consumption in real driving conditions 
  by 10%-20% (IPCC, 1996).</p>
<p>Car technology is also a good example of &#147;lock-in&#148;. A century of 
  development has put the gasoline engine, and the infrastructure to maintain 
  it and supply its fuel, in a virtually unassailable position. Technologies based 
  on alternative fuels, batteries, or fuel cells will have to compete with gasoline 
  engine performance and cost levels that continue to improve.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of lock-in can also be seen to apply to road transport more 
  generally. Cars are preferred over other transport modes partly because of their 
  intrinsic advantages in flexibility, convenience, comfort, and privacy. A car 
  makes it possible to live in a suburban or rural area poorly served by public 
  transport, taking advantage of low house prices and pleasant surroundings. However, 
  there are also many sources of &#147;positive returns to scale&#148;, strengthening 
  the incentives for using cars as their prevalence grows.</p>
<p>As car fleets have grown, modern western societies, cultures, and economies 
  are increasingly built around motorized road transport. Car-oriented culture 
  has charged cars with significance as a means of freedom, mobility and safety, 
  a symbol of personal status and identity, and as one of the most important products 
  in the industrial economy. Car-oriented infrastructure and settlement planning 
  makes it hard to use any alternative transport mode. Many attempts to encourage 
  a shift in planning provision away from cars, toward public and non-motorized 
  transport also fail because of the strength of links among transport planners, 
  construction firms and the financing institutions (e.g., Stenstadvold, 1995).</p>
<p>A second aspect of the lock-in to car transport is the result of economies 
  of scale, and a century of R&amp;D and learning from experience in car production. 
  The real cost of owning and operating a car has declined over the last half 
  century while public transport costs have risen. The declining number of people 
  using buses, especially in rural areas, makes it uneconomic to operate services 
  without subsidies. Falling bus and train occupancy levels also reduce their 
  energy intensity advantage relative to cars, indeed, in some countries, trains 
  consume more energy per passenger-km than cars (IPCC, 1996).</p>
<p>A third source of lock-in is linked to personal safety. With growing numbers 
  of cars on the roads and declining numbers of pedestrians, the streets have 
  become more dangerous. While travelling by car poses a higher risk of death 
  or injury from accidents than travelling by bus or train, a car does offer protection 
  from personal assault.</p>
<p>Because of the social and economic importance of transport, most governments 
  provide budgetary subsides for construction and maintenance of transport infrastructure, 
  and for transport services including many linked to car use (de Moor and Calamai, 
  1996; OECD, 1997b). Public finance for public and non-motorized transport has 
  been generally less readily available than for road building since the 1950s. 
  Other government instruments often support road transport, one example being 
  planning laws that require off-street parking to be provided in new urban developments. 
  It is the combination of policies and institutional relationships protecting 
  road transport interests that poses the greatest barrier to change, rather than 
  any single type of instrument (OECD, 1997b).</p>
<p>People have distorted perceptions of the relative convenience and cost of transport 
  modes, usually justifying their habitual mode choices (Goodwin, 1985; OECD, 
  1997a). Bus users perceive trains as more expensive and less convenient than 
  they really are, while train users have a similar misperception of buses. Car 
  drivers believe that car use is cheaper and faster than it is. </p>
<p>GHG mitigation efforts in freight transport also face many barriers. The energy 
  intensity of road freight can be reduced by improving fleet dispatching and 
  routing, reducing the number of empty trips, and improving driving skills. While 
  freight firms continue to make substantial efforts to minimize fuel use by trucks, 
  speed, flexibility and responsiveness to customers is often a higher priority.</p>
<p>Moving freight by rail instead of by road can offer considerable energy savings 
  in some countries (IPCC, 1996), mainly where long distances are involved and 
  the freight can travel relatively slowly. However, nearly all freight movements 
  must start and end by road, so that taking advantage of the low energy intensity 
  of rail freight entails a loss of convenience as either containers must be loaded 
  onto the train and unloaded for delivery, or trucks must be carried &#147;piggy-back&#148;. 
  Increasing rail freight depends on substantial investments in road-rail terminals. 
  Meanwhile, it may be difficult for railways to operate efficiently with high 
  levels of both passenger and freight traffic owing to the different operating 
  patterns entailed.</p>
