<h1>3 Technological and Economic Potential of Mitigation Options</h1>
<h2><a name="31"></a>3.1 Key Developments in Knowledge about Technological Options 
  to Mitigate GHG Emissions in the Period up to 2010-2020 since the Second Assessment 
  Report</h2>
Technologies and practices to reduce GHG emissions are continuously being developed. 
Many of these technologies focus on improving the efficiency of fossil fuel energy 
or electricity use and the development of low carbon energy sources, since the 
majority of GHG emissions (in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents) are related 
to the use of energy. Energy intensity (energy consumed divided by gross domestic 
product (GDP)) and carbon intensity (CO<sub>2</sub> emitted from burning fossil 
fuels divided by the amount of energy produced) have been declining for more than 
100 years in developed countries without explicit government policies for decarbonization, 
and have the potential to decline further. Much of this change is the result of 
a shift away from high carbon fuels such as coal towards oil and natural gas, 
through energy conversion efficiency improvements and the introduction of hydro 
and nuclear power. Other non-fossil fuel energy sources are also being developed 
and rapidly implemented and have a significant potential for reducing GHG emissions. 
Biological sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> removal and storage 
can also play a role in reducing GHG emissions in the future (see also <a href="024.htm">Section 
4</a> below). Other technologies and measures focus on the non-energy sectors 
for reducing emissions of the remaining major GHGs: CH<sub>4</sub>, nitrous oxide 
(N<sub>2</sub>O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur 
hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>). 
<p>Since the SAR several technologies have advanced more rapidly than was foreseen 
  in the earlier analysis. Examples include the market introduction of efficient 
  hybrid engine cars, rapid advancement of wind turbine design, demonstration 
  of underground carbon dioxide storage, and the near elimination of N<sub>2</sub>O 
  emissions from adipic acid production. Greater energy efficiency opportunities 
  for buildings, industry, transportation, and energy supply are available, often 
  at a lower cost than was expected. By the year 2010 most of the opportunities 
  to reduce emissions will still come from energy efficiency gains in the end-use 
  sectors, by switching to natural gas in the electric power sector, and by reducing 
  the release of process GHGs from industry, e.g., N<sub>2</sub>O, perfluoromethane 
  (CF<sub>4</sub>), and HFCs. By the year 2020, when a proportion of the existing 
  power plants will have been replaced in developed countries and countries with 
  economies in transition (EITs), and when many new plants will become operational 
  in developing countries, the use of renewable sources of energy can begin contributing 
  to the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In the longer term, nuclear energy 
  technologies &#150; with inherent passive characteristics meeting stringent 
  safety, proliferation, and waste storage goals &#150; along with physical carbon 
  removal and storage from fossil fuels and biomass, followed by sequestration, 
  could potentially become available options. </p>
<p>Running counter to the technological and economic potential for GHG emissions 
  reduction are rapid economic development and accelerating change in some socio-economic 
  and behavioural trends that are increasing total energy use, especially in developed 
  countries and high-income groups in developing countries. Dwelling units and 
  vehicles in many countries are growing in size, and the intensity of electrical 
  appliance use is increasing. Use of electrical office equipment in commercial 
  buildings is increasing. In developed countries, and especially the USA, sales 
  of larger, heavier, and less efficient vehicles are also increasing. Continued 
  reduction or stabilization in retail energy prices throughout large portions 
  of the world reduces incentives for the efficient use of energy or the purchase 
  of energy efficient technologies in all sectors. With a few important exceptions, 
  countries have made little effort to revitalize policies or programmes to increase 
  energy efficiency or promote renewable energy technologies. Also since the early 
  1990s, there has been a reduction in both public and private resources devoted 
  to R&amp;D (research and development) to develop and implement new technologies 
  that will reduce GHG emissions.</p>
<p>In addition, and usually related to technological innovation options, there 
  are important possibilities in the area of social innovation. In all regions, 
  many options are available for lifestyle choices that may improve quality of 
  life, while at the same time decreasing resource consumption and associated 
  GHG emissions. Such choices are very much dependent on local and regional cultures 
  and priorities. They are very closely related to technological changes, some 
  of which can be associated with profound lifestyle changes, while others do 
  not require such changes. While these options were hardly noted in the SAR, 
  this report begins to address them.<br>
