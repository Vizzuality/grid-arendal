<h3>9.2.7 Construction<br>
</h3>
<p>This section is concerned with the impact of mitigation on the construction 
  industry, rather than with the options for mitigating energy use in buildings, 
  which are considered in <a href="089.htm">Chapter 3</a>. One of the main products 
  of the construction sector are buildings which require energy for a number of 
  services such as lighting, space heating and cooling, and electricity for equipment. 
  Energy consumption in buildings reaches nearly one-third of total primary energy 
  consumption in the US, and hence their importance for GHG emission reductions. 
  Mitigation will lead to changes in the materials used, and in design and heat 
  control, all tending to increase the quantity (output) and improve the quality 
  of buildings. Most renewable energy investments, such as hydropower and electricity 
  from biomass, also require inputs from the construction sector. </p>
<p>Multisectoral modelling suggests that carbon tax and permit policies will have 
  little impact on construction output and employment; this finding is established 
  in the literature, but incomplete. <a href="356.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a> shows 
  that according to three different macroeconomic models (Garbaccio <i>et al</i>. 
  1999; Jorgenson <i>et al</i>., 1999; and Barker, 1999) construction will increase 
  its output by about +1%. Two other models in the same table (Bertram <i>et al</i>., 
  1993; Cambridge Econometrics, 1998) find 0% variation in the construction output.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="928"></a>9.2.8 Transport </h3>
<p>Transport energy use has been growing steadily worldwide, with the largest 
  increases occurring in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and it is projected 
  to grow more rapidly than energy use in other sectors through at least until 
  2020 (Michaelis and Davidson, 1996; IEA, 1997b; Schafer, 1998; Nakicenovic <i>et 
  al</i>., 2000). There are few options available to reduce transport energy use 
  which do not involve significant economic, social or political costs. Governments 
  presently find it difficult to implement measures to reduce overall demand for 
  mobility (IEA, 1997b). Singapore is an exception to this general rule as a result 
  of a comprehensive set of policies dating from 1975 to limit traffic (Michaelowa, 
  1996). <br>
</p>
<p>Almost all transport energy is supplied from oil, and the growing demand for 
  transport seems inconsistent with macroeconomic studies that project decreased 
  demand for oil as the result of GHG mitigation policies. Further research is 
  needed to resolve this apparent inconsistency (Bernstein and Pan, 2000). <br>
</p>
<p>Local concerns, traffic congestion and air pollution, are currently the key 
  drivers for transport policy (Bernstein and Pan, 2000). Measures to reduce traffic 
  congestion also reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, since they involve either reducing 
  the number of vehicles on the road or increasing the average speed and fuel 
  efficiency at which vehicles travel through urban areas. Policies to reduce 
  traffic congestion include: improvements in mass transit, incentives for car 
  pooling, and fees for entering city centres (Bose, 2000), as well as employer-based 
  transport management, parking management, park-and-ride programmes, and road 
  use pricing. One approach has been to assess the external (social) costs of 
  transport, including contribution to global warming, as a guide to the level 
  of taxes or user charges by transport modes that would internalize these costs, 
  and hence improve the efficiency of the system (ECMT, 1998).</p>

<p><a name="fig95"></a>An &#147;information society&#148; based on a digital information 
  network is sometimes projected to replace a substantial proportion of physical 
  travel. However, historical data show that the telegraph and telephone did not 
  affect the steady growth of transportation in France (see <a href="#fig95">Figure 
  9.5</a>). Mokhtarian <i>et al</i>. (1995) conclude that telecommuting, one aspect 
  of the information society, does reduce transportation energy use. However, 
  the reductions are smaller than often assumed, because they are partially offset 
  by increased household energy use, and because some telecommuters do so only 
  for part of their working day. Care must be taken in extrapolating future reductions 
  from the limited case studies currently available; the behaviour of early-adapters 
  may be different from that of later telecommuters. In the medium term, macro 
  view, information technologies appear to be complementary to transportation 
  (Gruebler, 1998); but in the longer term an &#147;information society&#148; 
  could significantly replace travel and associated impacts, although this remains 
  speculative.</p>
<h4><a name="9281"></a>9.2.8.1 Aviation</h4>
<p>In 1999, in response to a request from the International Civil Aviation Organization 
  (ICAO), the IPCC prepared a Special Report, Aviation and the Global Atmosphere, 
  which included a comprehensive review of the potential impacts of aviation on 
  the climate system (Penner <i>et al</i>., 1999). The demand for air travel, 
  as measured in revenue passenger-kilometres, is projected to grow by 5%/year 
  for the next 15 years, but improvements in efficiency and operations are projected 
  to hold the growth in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to 3%/year. Aircraft also emit 
  water vapour, NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>x</sub> and soot, and trigger the formation 
  of condensation trails (contrails) and may increase cirrus cloudiness &#150; 
  all of which contribute to climate change (Penner <i>et al</i>., 1999). <br>
</p>
<p> Penner <i>et al</i>. present several growth scenarios for aviation that provide 
  a basis for sensitivity analysis for climate modelling. These scenarios, which 
  assume the scope for switching from air travel to other modes of travel is limited, 
  show radiative forcing resulting from subsonic aircraft emissions growing from 
  the 1992 level of 0.05Wm<sup>-2</sup> to between 0.13 and 0.56Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  by 2050. The scenario with economic growth equal to the IS92a reference scenario 
  indicates that aviation may contribute 0.19 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, or about 5% of 
  anthropogenic radiative forcing, by 2050. More supersonic aircraft would substantially 
  increase this contribution, although there is considerable uncertainty whether 
  any such fleet will be developed. The growth scenarios do not consider air space 
  and infrastructure limitations; however, recent experience in both Europe and 
  North America indicates that the air traffic system is reaching saturation. 
  Penner <i>et al</i>. assume that by 2050 all currently identified improvements 
  in aircraft efficiency and operations will be implemented. However, turnover 
  time in the aviation industry is long. Individual aircraft will be operated 
  by commercial airlines for 25 years or more, and a successful product, including 
  its derivatives, will be produced for possibly 25 years or longer. Thus, the 
  overall life of an aircraft type can exceed 50 years. </p>
<p>Penner <i>et al</i>. (1999) conclude: <br>
  &#147;Although improvements in aircraft and engine technology and in the efficiency 
  of the air traffic control system will bring environmental benefits, these will 
  not fully offset the effects of increased emissions from the projected growth 
  in aviation. Policy options to reduce emissions further include more stringent 
  aircraft emissions regulations, removal of subsidies and incentives that have 
  negative environmental consequences, market-based options such as environmental 
  levies (charges and taxes) and emissions trading, voluntary agreements, research 
  programmes, and substitution of aviation by rail and coach. Most of these options 
  would lead to increased airline costs and fares. Some of these approaches have 
  not been fully investigated or tested in aviation and their outcomes are uncertain 
  (Penner <i>et al</i>., 1999, p. 11).&#148;<br>

<p>The need for further research in this area is explored at the end of the chapter.</p>
