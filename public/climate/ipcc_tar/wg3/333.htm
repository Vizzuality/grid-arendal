<h3>8.2.3 The Impact of Considering Multiple Gases and Carbon Sinks </h3>
<p>The overwhelming majority of T-D mitigation studies concentrate upon CO<sub>2</sub> 
  abatement from fossil fuel consumption, while an increasing number of B-U studies 
  tend to incorporate all the GHG emissions from the energy sector, but still 
  not include emissions from the agricultural sector and sequestration. However, 
  the Kyoto Protocol also includes methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), 
  perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) 
  as gases subject to control. The Protocol also allows credit for carbon sinks 
  that result from direct, human-induced afforestation and reforestation measures 
  taken after 1990. This may have significant impacts on abatement costs. </p>
<p>A recent study (Reilly <i>et al., </i>1999) estimated the mitigation costs 
  for the USA and included consideration of all of these gases and forest sinks. 
  The study assumes that the Kyoto Protocol is ratified in the USA and implemented 
  with a cap and trade policy. The analysis considers the effects of including 
  the other gases in the Kyoto Protocol in terms of the effect on allowable emissions, 
  reference emissions, the required reduction, and the cost of control.</p>
<p>For the USA, the authors estimate that base year (1990) emissions were 1,654MtC<sub>eq</sub>, 
  converting non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases to carbon equivalent units using 100-year 
  global warming potential indices (GWPs) as prescribed in the Kyoto Protocol. 
  This compares with 1,362MtC<sub>eq</sub> for carbon emissions alone. The result 
  is that allowable emissions are 1,539MtC<sub>eq</sub> in the multigas case compared 
  with 1,267MtC<sub>eq</sub> if other gases had not been included in the agreement.</p>
<p>The authors also projected emissions of other gases to grow substantially through 
  2010 in the absence of GHG control policies, so that total emissions in the 
  reference case reach 2,188MtC<sub>eq</sub> compared with 1,838MtC<sub>eq</sub> 
  of carbon only. The combination of these factors means that the required reduction 
  is 650MtC<sub>eq</sub> in the multigas case compared with 571MtC<sub>eq</sub> 
  if only carbon is subject to control. To analyze the impact of including the 
  other gases in the Kyoto Protocol the authors consider three policy cases: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Case 1, fossil CO<sub>2</sub> target and control.</i> This case includes 
    only CO<sub>2</sub> in determining the allowable emissions under the Kyoto 
    Protocol and includes only emissions reductions of CO<sub>2</sub>, unlike 
    the requirements in the Kyoto Protocol that require consideration of multiple 
    gases.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Case 2, multigas target with control on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions only. 
    </i>This case is constructed with the multigas target (expressed as carbon 
    equivalents using GWPs) as described in the Kyoto Protocol, but only carbon 
    emissions from fossil fuels are controlled. <br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Case 3, multigas target and controls.</i> The multigas Kyoto target applies 
    and the Parties seek the least-cost control across all gases and carbon sinks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Case 1 is thus comparable to many other studies that only consider CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and provides an approximate ability to normalize results with other studies. 
  For Case 1 the resultant carbon price is US$187 in 1985 price (US$269 in 1997 
  price). Case 2 illustrates that, if the USA does not adopt measures that take 
  advantage of abatement options in other gases and sinks, the cost could be significantly 
  higher (US$229 in 1985 price or US$330 in 1997 price). In 1997 US$, the total 
  cost in terms of reduced output is estimated to be US$54 billion for Case 1, 
  US$66 billion in Case 2, and US$40 billion in Case 3.</p>
<p>By comparison with Case 1, the introduction of all gases and the forest sink 
  results in a 20% decline in the carbon price to US$150 (1985 price, US$216 in 
  1997 price).</p>
<p>Cases 2 and 3 are comparable in the sense that they nominally achieve the same 
  reduction in GHGs (when weighted using 100-year GWPs). Thus, for a comparable 
  control level, the multigas control strategy is estimated to reduce US total 
  costs by nearly 40%.</p>
<p>The Reilly <i>et al. </i>(1999) study did not conduct sensitivity analyses 
  of the control costs, but noted the wide range of uncertainties in any costs 
  estimates. Both base year inventories and future emissions of other GHGs are 
  uncertain, more so than for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuels. Moreover, 
  some thought will be required to include other GHGs and sinks within a flexible 
  market mechanism such as a cap and trade system. Measuring and monitoring emissions 
  of other GHGs and sinks could add to the cost of controlling them and so reduce 
  the abatement potential.<br>
