<p>In <a href="051.htm">Sections 1.2</a> and <a href="056.htm">1.3</a>, we examined 
  literature that was motivated primarily by concerns of global cost-effectiveness 
  and global equity respectively. We now turn to a third category of literature, 
  which is motivated largely by considerations of global sustainability. This 
  literature views the climate problem as a component of a larger problem, namely 
  the unsustainable lifestyles and patterns of production and consumption, and 
  explores a broad range of options for moving the world towards a sustainable 
  future (<a href="061.htm#fig16">Figure 1.6</a>).</p>
<h3><a name="141"></a>1.4.1 Alternative Development Pathways</h3>
<p>The modes of analysis in the studies reviewed in <a href="051.htm">Sections 
  1.2</a> and <a href="056.htm">1.3 </a>start, by and large, with existing institutions 
  and behaviour, and examine their implications for future outcomes. The literature 
  discussed in this section adopts a different approach. It starts with desirable 
  outcomes and examines actions and institutions from the point of view of their 
  compatibility with desirable outcomes. It seeks to fulfil a different objective. 
  It aims to create shared visions of sustainable and desirable societies among 
  the general public, and so it does not, in the first place, suggest implementation 
  alternatives for fixed goals to decision makers (Costanza, 2000). To enlarge 
  the range of accessible options in future decisions, authors who contribute 
  to this line of inquiry intend to foster a process of societal learning among 
  citizens. After all, value formation through public discussion is, as Sen (1995) 
  suggests, the essence of democracy. In doing so, the work of these authors complements 
  the studies discussed above by providing alternative frameworks, normative contexts, 
  and sets of methodological tools to assess (a broader range of) policy options. 
  Conceptually speaking, this literature takes two forms. The first offers visions 
  of the future based on the inter-relation of various factors across a long time-scale. 
  The second explores possible elements of future scenarios, often relying upon 
  the extrapolation of the existing experience with sustainable practices.</p>
<p>The bulk of this literature starts with the recognition that long-term sustainability 
  can imply an appropriate scale of resource flows, in society (Daly, 1997). Taking 
  a society of appropriate physical scale as a desirable future, this literature 
  goes on to works backwards (backcasts) through possible development paths that 
  may lead from present-day society to a more sustainable, and in the case of 
  concerns about climate change, low-carbon society. Authors who write from this 
  perspective usually assume that resource availability, technology, and society 
  move forwards in a co-evolutionary fashion (Norgaard, 1994). They work on the 
  hypothesis that the transition to balanced and sustainable resource flows implies 
  concomitant changes in technologies, institutions, lifestyles, and worldviews. 
  Though this research takes a certain state of sustainability as its point of 
  departure, it is also sensitive to the principles of equity and cost-effectiveness. 
  It tends to view these as second-order principles that provide structure to 
  the pursuit of sustainability, the first-order principle. In a sense, this literature 
  can be viewed as the mirror image of the studies reviewed earlier&#150;studies 
  that justify the pursuit of sustainability on the grounds of efficiency and 
  equity. </p>
<p>This perspective becomes relevant when it is placed in the context of concernsabout 
  unsustainability (loss of biological diversity, extinction of species, air and 
  water pollution, deforestation, desertification, persistent poverty, and rising 
  inequality both within and between nations, and so on). These concerns are derived 
  from underlying pressures imposed by the growth of consumption and population 
  and the inability of many people and communities to protect their health and 
  livelihoods against these damages. Climate change is thus a potentially critical 
  factor in the larger process of society&#146;s adaptive response to changing 
  historical conditions through its choice of developmental paths (Cohen <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1998, p. 360). <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a> of this report (based 
  on the IPCC (2000a) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES)) notes, for 
  example, that future emissions will be determined not just by climate policy, 
  but also and more importantly by the &#147;world&#148; in which we will live. 
  Decisions about technology, investment, trade, poverty, biodiversity, community 
  rights, social policies, or governance, which may seem unrelated to climate 
  policy, may have profound impacts upon emissions, the extent of mitigation required, 
  and the cost and benefits that result. Conversely, climate policies that implicitly 
  address social, environmental, economic, and security issues may turn out to 
  be important levers for creating a sustainable world (Reddy <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1997, 
  p. 6).</p>
<p>Backcasting from desirable future conditions can, according to Thompson <i><i>et al</i></i>. (1986), be a useful response to situations characterized by a high degree 
  of ignorance, for which it is difficult to assess the probabilities of possible 
  outcomes or even to know what those possible outcomes might be. Although there 
  is a scientific consensus that anthropogenic climate change is occurring, there 
  is considerable uncertainty about the rate of expected change and its manifestations 
  and impacts at the regional and global levels (see IPCC, 2001, Chapter 19). 
  Science cannot predict the climate and its impacts in Milwaukee, Mumbai, or 
  Moscow half a century ahead very accurately, and it may never be able to do 
  so. Moreover, these types of predictions also require scenarios of the social, 
  economic, and technological paths that the world will follow over the same period 
  (see <a href="068.htm">Chapter 2</a>)&#150;knowledge that may be further beyond 
  our reach than climate prediction. Moreover, this uncertainty increases with 
  the time scale. </p>
<p>The high degree of uncertainty under which climate policy must be developed 
  has important implications for the type of policy regimes likely to be most 
  effective. There is a high degree of uncertainty about how ecosystems would 
  respond to climate change in the studies reviewed here. This recognition suggests 
  that a portfolio approach that includes a broad range of policies diversified 
  across all the major uncertainties might be better than betting on any one particular 
  set of outcomes. Some studies have even drawn a direct parallel between the 
  value of biological diversity and the diversity of institutions and worldviews 
  that contribute to the social capital necessary to maintain the sustainability 
  of human societies (Rayner and Malone, 1998b). Stressing the relationship between 
  risk, resilience, and governance, these authors argue that rather than seeking 
  to anticipate and fix particular problems, the purpose of policy should be to 
  develop coping capacity. This would both switch development and environmental 
  management strategies more nimbly as scientific information improves and strengthen 
  the resilience of vulnerable communities to climate impacts. Conditions of deep 
  uncertainty make it rational for societies to focus on increasing their resilience 
  and flexibility. Resilience in the face of unknown challenges, this research 
  argues, may be achieved by relying on the formation of values and worldviews 
  that embrace the goal of long-term sustainability, at least until some of the 
  key uncertainties are resolved to the point that pursuit of a more narrowly 
  focused policy regime can be justified.</p>
<p>Backcasting from a sustainable future state also supports the search for options 
  with which certain normative goals might be achieved. For climate mitigation 
  scenarios, such a goal might be expressed as a hypothetically acceptable stabilization 
  threshold for GHG concentrations that may, in turn, imply certain trajectories 
  for emission reductions. At this point, therefore, it is useful to review the 
  historical data of global and regional carbon emissions in aggregate as well 
  as in per capita terms (<a href="060.htm#tab11">Table 1.1</a>; see also <a href="057.htm#box11">Box 
  1.1</a> on the controversy over presentation of data). In 1996, aggregate global 
  emissions were about 6GtC, that is about 1 tonne of carbon per capita world-wide. 
  Of this, the 1.2 billion people living in Annex I countries emitted roughly 
  64% (3.8GtC), or an average of about 3 tonnes of carbon per capita (3tC/capita). 
  In contrast, 4.4 billion people living in non-Annex I countries were responsible 
  for the remaining 2.1GtC, averaging only 0.5tC/capita, or about one-sixth the 
  average for richer countries. Global emissions increased from 5.8GtC to 6GtC 
  from 1990 to 1996, and are projected to increase to 6.4GtC in 2000 and 9.8GtC 
  in 2020.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#22","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>22</sup></small></a> 
  Non-Annex I emissions are growing much faster than those of Annex I countries, 
  averaging 3.5% annual growth compared with 1% in Annex I. As a result, the Annex 
  I share of emissions is declining&#150;from approximately 72% in 1990 and 64% 
  in 1995 to a projected 50% in 2020. </p>
<p><a href="060.htm#tab12">Table 1.2</a> provides long-term information by displaying 
  aggregate emissions budgets for IPCC SRES scenarios (IPCC, 2000a) and for various 
  stabilization goals identified in the SAR (IPCC, 1996). These goals translate 
  into a 100-year emissions &#147;budget&#148; of 630GtC&#150;13,00GtC. As discussed 
  in <a href="057.htm">Section 1.3.1</a>, the target of 450ppmv translates into 
  a reduction (by 2100) of annual emissions to about 3GtC; that is reductions 
  in annual emissions to half of the current level of about 6GtC. Simply stated, 
  per capita emissions of all countries have to fall below current levels in developing 
  countries if GHG stabilization at low levels is to be the targetted future. 
  If these reductions were shared equally, per capita emissions of developed countries 
  would decline by a factor of 10, while emissions from developing countries would 
  halve<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#23","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>23</sup></small></a>. 
</p>
These issues, as well as others with purviews beyond the confines of climate change, 
can provide a starting point for a variety of approaches and analyses. The studies 
reviewed here investigate kinds of behaviour, institutions, values, technologies, 
and lifestyles that would be compatible or incompatible with a &#147;desirable&#148; 
or targetted future. They argue, implicitly or explicitly, that sustainability 
is built on societal goals made mutually supportive early in the process, when 
the goals and policies of society are being set, rather than downstream after 
the costs of unsustainable development have already been incurred (Schmidt-Bleek, 
1994; Factor 10 Club, 1995). For this reason, they often adopt the industrial 
metabolism approach, focussing on the flow of materials and energy in modern society 
through the chain of extraction, production, consumption, and disposal (Ayres 
and Simonis, 1994; Fischer-Kowalski <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1997; Opschoor, 1997). 
It is argued that the pressure the human economy exerts on the environment depends 
on levels and patterns of these flows between the economy and the biosphere. Within 
this conceptual framework, sustainability requires reductions in the overall level 
of resource flows, particularly the primary flow of (fossil) materials and energy 
at the input side. Trajectories of emissions reduction of the sort described above 
can, therefore, be taken as rough indicators for the order of magnitude of the 
changes involved in the transition to long-term sustainability. In light of this 
perspective, a number of studies of developed countries (Buitenkamp <i><i>et al</i></i>., 
1992; McLaren <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1997; Carley and Spapens, 1998; Sachs <i><i>et 
al</i></i>., 1998; Bologna <i><i>et al</i></i>., 2000) have attempted to backcast 
a transition to a society capable of creating human welfare with a constantly 
diminishing amount of natural resources. Certainly, scenarios that explore such 
outcomes are not restricted to decarbonization or a trend toward carbon sequestration. 
They may, however, view policies that facilitate these trends as vehicles for 
nudging the world towards a sustainable future. 
<p>All of these scenarios proceed on the premise that economic growth (at least 
  as currently measured) is not the sole goal of societies across the globe. Moreover, 
  they assume that the relationships between economic growth and resource consumption, 
  on the one hand, and wellbeing, on the other, are not fixed. Both should, instead, 
  be shapable by political and social design. A given level of gross domestic 
  product (GDP) can be achieved with different resource flows (Adriaanse <i><i>et al</i></i>., 
  1997),<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#24","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>24</sup></small></a> and economic growth that takes societies beyond certain subsistence 
  levels may not increase satisfaction, or human welfare (UNDP, 1998), or societal 
  welfare (Cobb and Cobb, 1994; Linton, 1998). Consequently, the purpose of these 
  visions is to explore how societies might be able to decouple economic output 
  from resource flows (see Weizs&auml;cker <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1997; OECD, 1998) and wellbeing 
  from economic output (see Robinson and Herbert, 2000). Climate change mitigation 
  is one of the co-benefits of these decoupling processes.<br>
