<h4>10.3.2.3.2 Policies and Options for Change </h4>
<p><i>Environmental education</i><br>
  Although political attention is always in a process of change, public awareness 
  of environmental disruption in general and climate change in particular is at 
  a fairly high level in many developed countries, and has been rising over a 
  long period. This consciousness is generally ahead of the corresponding behaviour, 
  yet (apart from governmental action):</p>
<ul>
  <li>in many countries citizens initiatives offer bottom-up solutions for alternative 
    consumption patterns (Georg, 1999); and<br>
  </li>
  <li>environmental behaviour tends to cover consciousness in low-cost situations, 
    that is if the costs and inconvenience are not much higher for the environmentally 
    more benign solution (see Diekmann and Preisend&ouml;rfer (1992) for Germany 
    and Switzerland).</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly enough, these low-cost limits appear mainly to be a matter of 
  equity&#151;not to pay too much more than one&#146;s fellow citizens&#151;because 
  environmental legislation (for everybody) is accepted beyond those limits. Politically, 
  environmental consciousness can be promoted by environmental education. This 
  includes primary schools as well as high schools, adult education, and particularly 
  lecturer&#146;s education at the college and university level. Environmental 
  education could be more effective than it has proved so far if it recognized 
  that human behaviour hinges on lifestyle or self-awareness.</p>
<p><i>Decreasing marginal satisfaction with rising private material consumption</i><br>
  John Stuart Mill&#146;s idea that in affluent societies people might prefer 
  other forms of satisfaction to ever-increasing consumption of purchased commodities 
  is not prominent in contemporary economics, but has not completely disappeared 
  from economic thought (see Harrod, 1958; Hirsch, 1977; Xenos, 1989). Now there 
  are indications that the marginal utility of those commodities is steadily decreasing 
  with rising consumption (see Scherhorn, 1994; Inglehart, 1996). For instance, 
  although consumption in the USA has doubled since 1957, it is reported that 
  the average US citizen considers his or her happiness to have decreased since 
  then (UNDP, 1998). Sanne (1998) reports from Sweden that 87% of the people have 
  a car, but 14% of these do not &#147;need&#148; it while only 47% consider it 
  to be &#147;necessary&#148;. Similarly, 52% have a dishwasher, but 30% of these 
  do not &#147;need&#148; it and only 12% deem it &#147;necessary&#148;. The mismatch 
  between economic consumption and the satisfaction of human needs is shown by 
  the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare. This ran parallel to GNP up to the 
  1970s, but rapidly departed after that (Nordhaus and Tobin, 1972; Daly and Cobb, 
  1989; Jackson and Marks, 1999). If these discrepancies became a political issue 
  the personal relevance of consumption patterns could decrease. Politically, 
  the introduction of a suitable index of welfare and stimulation of public dialogue 
  on the goals of economic action could foster this.</p>
<p><i>New emphasis on immaterial and common goods</i><br>
  Goods may be either common or private and either material or immaterial, so 
  four combinations arise:</p>
<ul>
  <li>private material goods (e.g., house or car);<br>
  </li>
  <li>private immaterial goods (e.g., well-being or creativity);<br>
  </li>
  <li>common material goods (e.g., shared cars or household appliances); and<br>
  </li>
  <li>common immaterial goods (e.g., environmental quality or collective actions, 
    such as the liberation of a creek, common attendance of public facilities, 
    etc.).</li>
</ul>
