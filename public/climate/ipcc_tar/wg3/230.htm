<h4>6.1.5.2 Implications for Global Climate Change Policy </h4>
<p>Since the political factors on the &#147;supply side&#148; are so heterogeneous 
  across nations, the focus here is on the demand for regulations, building on 
  the literature reviewed above to draw conclusions about the likely preferences 
  and positions of key interest groups involved in climate change policy. Five 
  groups seem particularly important: environmental organizations (especially 
  in the USA and Europe), producers of carbon-based fuels (e.g., coal and oil 
  producers), large users of fuel (e.g., electric utilities), manufacturers of 
  energy-using products (e.g., automobile manufacturers), and manufacturers of 
  energy-efficient and GHG-abatement technologies (e.g., manufacturers of efficient 
  lighting). Environmental organizations in the USA and Europe seem to be divided&#150;some 
  groups have embraced market-based policies such as emissions permits and carbon 
  taxes, while others object to such policies being applied without restrictions. 
  Some also object to the option of so-called exchanges of &#147;hot air&#148; 
  (national quota surpluses not created by active policies).</p>
<p>The range of industry sectors with large stakes in global climate policy suggests 
  an important point: the various regulatory instruments that might be employed 
  in climate change policy would each act at different levels of regulation, creating 
  different points of compliance with very different implications for interest 
  groups. Examples are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a system of tradable carbon permits (or a carbon tax, for that matter) imposed 
    at the mine mouth, wellhead, or point-of-entry directly affects fuel producers 
    (although the true economic incidence of the policy would be shared by downstream 
    firms and consumers according to relative elasticities);<br>
  </li>
  <li>a CO<sub>2</sub> tax, tradable emissions permit system, or emissions standard 
    directly affects power plants; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>energy-efficiency or fuel-efficiency standards directly affect manufacturers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Industry groups&#150;in particular, large producers and users of fuel&#150;are 
  also likely to focus their efforts on the allocation of carbon-reduction responsibilities, 
  whatever the instrument. If a system of emissions standards is put into place, 
  for example, existing firms will benefit if tighter standards are imposed on 
  new sources, as has happened in a number of countries. Under an emissions tax, 
  firms are likely to seek tax credits, differential tax rates, or exemptions 
  to relieve their tax burden. In a system of tradable permits, firms are likely 
  to support the free allocation of permits to participants, rather than to sell 
  them at auction or distribute them to the public (for subsequent sale to firms). 
  For project-based mechanisms&#150;CDM and JI&#150;they would favour leaving 
  much of the initiative with the private sector (Jepma and Van der Gaast, 1999). 
  Industries that stand to profit from GHG abatement, including renewable energy 
  sources, are likely supporters of climate policies (Michaelowa and Dutschke, 
  1999a, 1999b).</p>
<p>From a political standpoint, the success of such efforts at the distribution 
  of the burdens (or rents) is likely to depend on the political saliency of climate 
  change policy. Taxpayers and organized &#147;public-interest groups&#148; are 
  likely to oppose allocation schemes that benefit firms and/or benefit existing 
  firms at the cost of the newcomers, thus reducing the scope for competition. 
  If such groups wield clout, and if public interest in climate policy is high, 
  then mechanisms that appear to benefit polluters at the expense of the public 
  are less likely to be implemented.</p>
<p>In contrast, some environmental organizations have not opposed the allocation 
  of rents to industry, recognizing that free allocation of permits may be the 
  most likely path to implementing emissions reduction in some countries. Such 
  concessions on allocation of rents to the industry have allowed these groups 
  to secure other goals in return, such as continuous emissions monitoring&#150;the 
  US Acid Rain Program is a good example (Kete, 1992; Svendsen, 1999). In summary, 
  allocation schemes favourable to industry appear likely in practice, because 
  the question of distribution is central to industry, including industries that 
  will profit from climate policy, but it is only of secondary importance to environmental 
  groups that do not support free allocation and to other groups that seek to 
  reduce GHG emissions. In the US Acid Rain Program, for example, sulphur dioxide 
  (SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions allowances worth about US$5 billion per year were 
  allocated free to electric utilities, in part because of interest group politics 
  (Joskow and Schmalensee, 1988).</p>
<p>Although the &#147;supply side&#148; is heterogeneous across nations, it is 
  likely that some governments will favour policies that raise revenue while others 
  will be more concerned with the distribution of costs across sources, regardless 
  of the revenue implications.</p>
