<h4>5.3.1.2 Barriers and Opportunities for GHG Mitigation through Technological 
  Change </h4>
<p>Barriers to GHG mitigation and opportunities for overcoming them arise throughout 
  the innovation system. They relate both to the rate of technological change 
  and its direction. The predominant concern of governments, firms, and researchers 
  considering innovation policies has been to maximize the rate of technological 
  change and its contribution to national competitiveness (e.g., Freeman, 1987; 
  Dosi <i>et al</i>., 1988; Grossman and Helpman, 1991). Environmental concerns are usually 
  recognized but are rarely a major priority for national systems for innovation. 
  Indeed, there may even be a concern that paying more attention to innovation 
  strategies about environmental objectives would be detrimental to competitiveness.</p>
<p>There may be many opportunities to find synergies between the goals of improving 
  competitiveness and reducing GHG emissions. The most obvious of these opportunities 
  are cases where GHG mitigation could reduce costs. A greater challenge for businesses 
  and governments is to seize opportunities to create new markets for low-GHG-emitting 
  technology. One case of a successful strategy is the Danish development of wind 
  turbine technology (Kemp, 2000). </p>
<p>Communication &#150; among firms, between firms and users, and between firms 
  and universities or government labs &#150; is an important contributor to technological 
  change. Most innovations require some social or behavioural change on the part 
  of technology users (Rosenberg, 1994). Product innovations, if they are noticeable 
  by the user, demand a change in consumer behaviour and sometimes in consumer 
  preferences (OECD, 1998a). Some product innovations &#150; such as those that 
  result in faster computers or more powerful cars &#150; provide consumers with 
  more of what they already want. Nevertheless, successful marketing may depend 
  on consumer acceptance of the new technology. Other innovations, such as alternative 
  fuel vehicles or compact fluorescent lights, depend on consumers accepting different 
  performance characteristics or even redefining their preferences. While consumer 
  preferences are often seen as barriers to technological change, some of the 
  most successful firms are those that seize the opportunities they present, by 
  working with their customers in the development of new technology and services 
  (Lane and Maxfield, 1995).<br>
  <br>
  One of the most obvious barriers to using innovation to address GHG emissions 
  is the lack of incentives. Economic, regulatory, and social incentives for reducing 
  GHG emissions will also act as incentives for innovation to find new means of 
  mitigation. Another important type of barrier, which both slows technological 
  change in general and tends to skew it in particular directions, is that posed 
  by &#147;lock-in&#148; (see <a href="#box51">Box 5.1</a>). The tendency for 
  societies to lock in to particular clusters of technologies and patterns of 
  development can prevent new, low-GHG emission technologies entering the market. 
  Meanwhile, it is important to recognize when previously locked-in technology 
  is beginning to change, so that the opportunity can be grasped to introduce 
  low-emission technology.</p>

    <td class="box"><b>Box 5.1. Lock-In</b> 
      <p>Schumpeter (1928) emphasized the effectiveness of the capitalist system 
        in encouraging experiments and in selecting successes. This effectiveness 
        can be ascribed partly to the capitalist&#146;s ability to invest in risky 
        endeavours, trading off uncertainty against the size of the anticipated 
        return. The competitive market system also introduces the element of &#147;creative 
        destruction&#148; to the innovation process, analogous to natural selection, 
        ensuring that an innovation that does not meet the needs of the market 
        does not survive. Yet, despite their ability to select adequate technologies, 
        markets sometimes &#147;lock-in&#148; to technologies and practices that 
        are suboptimal because of increasing returns to scale, which block out 
        any alternatives (Arthur, 1988, 1994). The QWERTY English keyboard layout 
        is often mentioned as an example of an inefficient technology designed 
        to solve a specific problem (to avoid keys sticking in mechanical typewriters) 
        but which has become &#147;locked in&#148; (David, 1985). It has been 
        claimed that alternative keyboard designs could double typing speeds, 
        but these are not adopted because of the retraining costs that would be 
        necessary for any change. Lock-in phenomena are familiar in the energy 
        sector, with technologies and design standards in applications ranging 
        from power stations to light bulbs and urban design to vehicles.</p>
      <p>In many cases, a given technology helps to satisfy several different 
        types of need. This is particularly evident in two of the most significant 
        areas of energy use: cars and houses. Any individual may have a variety 
        of potentially conflicting objectives when choosing a technology. This 
        tendency of successful technologies to serve multiple needs contributes 
        to lock-in by making it harder for competing innovations to replace them 
        fully. Hence, many government attempts to introduce new, energy efficient 
        or alternative fuel technology, especially in the case of the car, have 
        failed because of a failure to me<i>et al</i>l the needs satisfied by the incumbent 
        technology. If alternative fuel vehicles have difficulty entering a market 
        dominated by gasoline cars, alternatives to the car face even greater 
        barriers. Owners have learned to associate their cars not only with personal 
        mobility, but also with freedom, flexibility, fun, status, safety, a personal 
        territory, and perhaps most powerful of all, a means of self-expression. 
        Different owners may place emphasis on different needs. To succeed without 
        some form of enforcement, any replacement must satisfy at least several 
        of these needs better than the existing technology.</p>
      <p>When a radical innovation does occur in a technology of fundamental importance, 
        it may trigger an avalanche as a complex web of technologies and institutions 
        require redevelopment (Schumpeter, 1935; Freeman and Perez, 1988). Such 
        a shift may now be occurring with the spread of mobile information, communication, 
        and networking technologies. Achieving substantial GHG mitigation may 
        depend on recognizing when such transformations are occurring, and taking 
        advantage of them. </p>
