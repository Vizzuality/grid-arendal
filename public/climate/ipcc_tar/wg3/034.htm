<h2><a name="73"></a>7.3 System Boundaries: Project, Sector, and Macro</h2>
<p>Researchers make a distinction between project, sector, and economywide analyses. 
  Project level analysis considers a &#147;stand-alone&#148; investment assumed 
  to have insignificant secondary impacts on markets. Methods used for this level 
  include CBA, CEA, and life-cycle analysis. Sector level analysis examines sectoral 
  policies in a &#147;partial-equilibrium&#148; context in which all other variables 
  are assumed to be exogenous. Economy-wide analysis explores how policies affect 
  all sectors and markets, using various macroeconomic and general equilibrium 
  models. A trade-off exists between the level of detail in the assessment and 
  complexity of the system considered. This section presents some of the key assumptions 
  made in cost analysis.</p>
<p>A combination of different modelling approaches is required for an effective 
  assessment of climate change mitigation options. For example, detailed project 
  assessment has been combined with a more general analysis of sectoral impacts, 
  and macroeconomic carbon tax studies have been combined with the sectoral modelling 
  of larger technology investment programmes.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="731"></a>7.3.1 Baselines</h3>
<p>The baseline case, which by definition gives the emissions of GHGs in the absence 
  of the climate change interventions being considered, is critical to the assessment 
  of the costs of climate change mitigation. This is because the definition of 
  the baseline scenario determines the potential for future GHG emissions reduction, 
  as well as the costs of implementing these reduction policies. The baseline 
  scenario also has a number of important implicit assumptions about future economic 
  policies at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels, including sectoral structure, 
  resource intensity, prices, and thereby technology choice.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="732"></a>7.3.2 Consideration of No Regrets Options </h3>
<p>No regrets options are by definition actions to reduce GHG emissions that have 
  negative net costs. Net costs are negative because these options generate direct 
  or indirect benefits, such as those resulting from reductions in market failures, 
  double dividends through revenue recycling and ancillary benefits, large enough 
  to offset the costs of implementing the options. The no regrets issue reflects 
  specific assumptions about the working and the efficiency of the economy, especially 
  the existence and stability of a social welfare function, based on a social 
  cost concept: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduction of existing market or institutional failures and other barriers 
    that impede adoption of cost-effective emission reduction measures can lower 
    private costs compared to current practice. This can also reduce private costs 
    overall.</li>
  <li>A double dividend related to recycling of the revenue of carbon taxes in 
    such a way that it offsets distortionary taxes.</li>
  <li>Ancillary benefits and costs (or ancillary impacts), which can be synergies 
    or trade-offs in cases in which the reduction of GHG emissions has joint impacts 
    on other environmental policies (<i>i.e.</i>, relating to local air pollution, urban 
    congestion, or land and natural resource degradation). </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Market Imperfections</i><br>
  The existence of a no regrets potential implies that market and institutions 
  do not behave perfectly, because of market imperfections such as lack of information, 
  distorted price signals, lack of competition, and/or institutional failures 
  related to inadequate regulation, inadequate delineation of property rights, 
  distortion-inducing fiscal systems, and limited financial markets. Reduction 
  of market imperfections suggests it is possible to identify and implement policies 
  that can correct these market and institutional failures without incurring costs 
  larger than the benefits gained.<br>
  <i><br>
  Double Dividend</i><br>
  The potential for a double dividend arising from climate mitigation policies 
  was extensively studied during the 1990s. In addition to the primary aim of 
  improving the environment (the first dividend), such policies, if conducted 
  through revenue-raising instruments such as carbon taxes or auctioned emission 
  permits, yield a second dividend, which can be set against the gross costs of 
  these policies. All domestic GHG policies have an indirect economic cost from 
  the interactions of the policy instruments with the fiscal system, but in the 
  case of revenue-raising policies this cost is partly offset (or more than offset) 
  if, for example, the revenue is used to reduce existing distortionary taxes. 
  Whether these revenue-raising policies can reduce distortions in practice depends 
  on whether revenues can be &#147;recycled&#148; to tax reduction.</p>
<p><i>Ancillary Benefits and Costs (Ancillary Impacts)</i><br>
  The definition of ancillary impacts is given above. As noted there, these can 
  be positive as well as negative. It is important to recognize that gross and 
  net mitigation costs cannot be established as a simple summation of positive 
  and negative impacts, because the latter are interlinked in a very complex way. 
  Climate change mitigation costs (gross and well as net costs) are only valid 
  in relation to a comprehensive specific scenario and policy assumption structure.</p>
<p>The existence of no regrets potentials is a necessary, but not a sufficient, 
  condition for the potential implementation of these options. The actual implementation 
  also requires the development of a policy strategy that is complex as comprehensive 
  enough to address these market and institutional failures and barriers.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="733"></a>7.3.3 Flexibility</h3>
<p>For a wide variety of options, the costs of mitigation depend on what regulatory 
  framework is adopted by national governments to reduce GHGs. In general, the 
  more flexibility the framework allows, the lower the costs of achieving a given 
  reduction. More flexibility and more trading partners can reduce costs. The 
  opposite is expected with inflexible rules and few trading partners. Flexibility 
  can be measured as the ability to reduce carbon emissions at the lowest cost, 
  either domestically or internationally.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="734"></a>7.3.4 Development, Equity, and Sustainability Issues</h3>
<p>Climate change mitigation policies implemented at a national level will, in 
  most cases, have implications for short-term economic and social development, 
  local environmental quality, and intra-generational equity. Mitigation cost 
  assessments that follow this line can address these impacts on the basis of 
  a decision-making framework that includes a number of side-impacts to the GHG 
  emissions reduction policy objective. The goal of such an assessment is to inform 
  decision makers about how different policy objectives can be met efficiently, 
  given priorities of equity and other policy constraints (natural resources, 
  environmental objectives). A number of international studies have applied such 
  a broad decision-making framework to the assessment of development implications 
  of CDM projects. </p>
<p>There are a number of key linkages between mitigation costing issues and broader 
  development impacts of the policies, including macroeconomic impacts, employment 
  creation, inflation, the marginal costs of public funds, capital availability, 
  spillovers, and trade.</p>
