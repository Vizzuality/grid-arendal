<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>Impoverished and marginalized areas in developing countries have been the main 
  targets for promoting participatory forms of decision making. The rationale 
  is straightforward: these segments of population are generally the less educated 
  and less organized, they are more difficult to reach, and the institutions that 
  serve them are often weak. A range of participatory methods better adapted to 
  work at the field level have been designed to engage and enable the poor to 
  become active actors in development programmes. These include workshop-based 
  and community-based methods for collaborative decision making, methods for stakeholder 
  consultation, and methods for incorporating participation and social analysis 
  into project design. Based on a World Bank (1996) survey of participatory methods, 
  <a href="#tab105">Table 10.5</a> summarizes some of relevant participatory tools.</p>

    <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><i>Appreciation&#150;influence&#150;control (AIC)</i><br>
      AIC encourages stakeholders to consider the social, political, and cultural 
      factors, along with the technical and economic aspects, that influence a 
      given project or policy. Activities focus on building appreciation through 
      listening, influence through dialogue, and control through action.</td>

  <tr> 
    <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><i>Objectives-oriented project planning (ZOPP)</i><br>
      The purpose of ZOPP is to undertake participatory, objectives-oriented planning 
      that spans the life of the project or policy work, while building stakeholder 
      commitment and capacity with a series of workshops. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><i>TeamUP</i><br>
      TeamUp builds on ZOPP, but emphasizes team building. It enables teams to

      PRA is a label given to a growing family of participatory approaches and 
      methods that emphasize local knowledge and enable people to undertake their 
      own appraisal, analysis, and planning. It enables devel- opment practitioners, 
      government officials, and local people to work together in context-appropriate 
      programmes. </td>

      The purpose of this participatory method is to (a) provide a multisectoral, 
      multilevel approach to team building through training, (b) encourage participants 
      to learn from local experiences rather than from external experts, and (c) 
      empower people at the community and agency levels to initiate action. </td>

      BA&#146;s general purposes are to (a) undertake systematic listening to 
      &#147;give voice&#148; to poor and other hard- to-reach beneficiaries, thereby 
      highlighting constraints to beneficiary participation, and (b) obtain feedback 
      on development interventions. </td>

      SCC refers to a group of methods used by the World Bank to improve communication 
      among Bank staff, direct and indirect beneficiaries and stakeholders of 
      bank-financed projects, government agencies, and service providers, so that 
      projects and policies are more demand-driven. </td>

  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td rowspan="2">Methods for social analysis</td>
    <td><i>Social assessment (SA)</i><br>
      Objectives of SA are to (a) identify key stakeholders and establish the 
      appropriate framework for their participation, (b) ensure that project objectives 
      and incentives for change are appropriate and acceptable to beneficiaries, 
      (c) assess social impacts and risks, and (d) minimize or mitigate adverse 
      impacts.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><i>Gender analysis (GA)</i><br>
      GA focuses on understanding and documenting the differences in gender roles, 
      activities, needs, and opportunities in a given context. It highlights the 
      different roles and learned behaviour of men and women based on gender attributes, 
      which vary across culture, class, ethnicity, income, education, and time.

<p>Involving citizens in the decision-making process is not an easy task. It requires 
  careful planning, thoughtful preparation, and flexibility to change procedures 
  on the demand of affected stakeholders. The selection of a supportive and conducive 
  structure for public discourse is essential, not only to gain public acceptance, 
  but also to take advantage of the full potential to articulate well-balanced 
  decisions (Renn et al., 1993). Setting aside technical aspects and contextual 
  differences, participatory forms of decision making are viewed as proper mechanisms 
  to achieve broader social goals (Beierle, 1998). These are to inform and educate 
  the public, incorporate public values, assumptions, and preferences into decision 
  making, increase the substantive quality of decisions, foster trust in institutions, 
  and reduce conflict among stakeholders.</p>
