<h3>6.4.4 Equity, Participation, and International Policy Instruments </h3>
<p>The participation of developing countries and EITs in the UNFCCC is important, 
  since these countries are both large future emitters of carbon, and sources 
  and potential sources of low-cost abatement investments (McKibbin and Wilcoxen, 
  2000). Since the participation of regions with low marginal abatement costs 
  may be critical for aggregate cost and emissions reduction, encouraging their 
  participation may require a serious consideration of the equity implication 
  of that policy (Morrisette and Plantinga, 1991). Unlike efficiency, there is 
  no universal consensus definition of equity by which policy instruments can 
  be evaluated. Recent research on equity, however, analyzed the welfare impacts 
  of climate policy alternatives to understand the participation incentives (for 
  different countries and regions) of various policy instruments (Bohm and Larsen, 
  1994; Edmonds <i>et al</i>., 1995; Rose <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>The types and structures of mechanisms adopted (such as uniform taxes, tradable 
  quota, or individual non-tradable targets) affect the scope and timing of participation 
  in some predictable ways (Edmonds <i>et al</i>., 1995). For example, individual 
  non-tradable targets based on the stabilization of national emissions would 
  shift more than 80% of aggregate costs to non-OECD regions by 2020, making it 
  unlikely that these regions would participate in such an agreement (Edmonds 
  <i>et al</i>., 1995).</p>
<p>Alternatively, with a common global carbon tax and full participation, the 
  burden of abatement costs would be distributed unevenly across the world and 
  would change with time. A large burden would fall on OECD and economies in transition 
  in the early years, shifting to developing nations in later years (Edmonds <i>et 
  al</i>., 1995). Transition economies would thus be unlikely to participate in 
  a common global carbon tax agreement. If such nations were to participate in 
  the short run, growth and changing economic and political circumstances may 
  increase the probability of their dropping out of a tax agreement when they 
  face increasing net participation costs (Edmonds <i>et al</i>., 1995).</p>
<p>The equity implications of a global tradable quota system depend on quota allocation. 
  The portion of global abatement costs borne by a country or group of countries 
  depends on its relative position in the quota market; net sellers of quota effectively 
  receive income transfers from net buyers. Table 6.3 describes the relative position 
  of groups of countries in an international quota market, based on six possible 
  initial allocations (Edmonds <i>et al</i>., 1995).<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#102","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>102</sup></small></a></p>
<p>Of course, a country&#146;s participation in an allocation scheme depends on 
  net costs (the sum of transfer payments associated with quota trade, plus direct 
  mitigation costs), not just the direction of income transfers. However, that 
  the direction of transfers may change over time, especially for China and the 
  transition economies, complicates the incorporation of equity goals in quota 
  system design (Edmonds <i>et al</i>., 1995). Although quota allocation is referred 
  to here, the analysis applies equivalently to redistributing international carbon 
  tax revenues (Pezzey, 1992; Rose <i>et al</i>., 1998).</p>
<p>Bohm and Larsen (1994) explore the participation implications of two of the 
  more frequently discussed of the allocation schemes listed in <a href="#tab63">Table 
  6.3</a> (allocation by population and by GDP) for a quota regime covering Western 
  Europe and Eastern Europe. Both of these allocations, and combinations thereof, 
  lead to substantial losses by the Eastern European countries, making their participation 
  unlikely (Bohm and Larsen, 1994). Given the aggregate cost-savings associated 
  with their participation, an ideal allocation system would provide the minimum 
  possible participation incentive to the Eastern European countries, while maximizing 
  potential abatement cost savings to the western countries. The authors identify 
  this lower bound in terms of eastern country quota-to-emissions ratios that 
  would induce participation, ranging among countries from 0.85 to 0.91. This 
  incentive scenario results in zero net gains (losses) to the eastern countries, 
  and net costs to each western country of 0.09% of GDP. In the presence of wide 
  disparity in current regional economic welfare, the perceived equity benefits 
  of such a scenario may facilitate a more cost-effective agreement than any that 
  might be achieved without Eastern European participation.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#103","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>103</sup></small></a></p>
<p>If quota allocations are used to induce participation by transition economies 
  and developing countries, the international wealth transfers that occur as a 
  result may cause fluctuations in real exchange rates and international capital 
  and trade flows (McKibbin and Wilcoxen, 1997a, 1997b). The magnitude of these 
  fluctuations and the extent to which they could be problematic are uncertain. 
  McKibbin and Wilcoxen (2000) suggest an alternative approach to the problem 
  of equity versus participation incentive, which includes both short-run emissions 
  quota and long-run emissions &#147;endowments&#148;. In this approach, the price 
  of emissions quota is set through international negotiation at regular intervals 
  (they suggest every decade), and each country issues as many quotas as necessary 
  to keep the price at the negotiated level. The price of emissions endowments, 
  however, is flexible, and the quantity allowed per country is fixed. Each participating 
  country&#146;s endowment prices reflect expected future prices of emissions 
  quota.<br>
