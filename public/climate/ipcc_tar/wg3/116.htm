<h3>3.6.2 Summary of the Second Assessment Report </h3>
<p>Little has changed in the industrialized agricultural sector during the past 
  few years apart from the continuing trends towards genetically modified crops 
  and animals, and reduced chemical input production methods (<a href="117.htm#3642">Section 
  3.6.4.2</a>). Farming systems remain a major contributor of anthropogenic emissions, 
  not just from energy inputs but mainly from methane from ruminants (cattle, 
  goats and sheep), livestock wastes, rice paddy fields, and nitrous oxide from 
  the application of nitrogenous fertilizers, and circulation of N within crop 
  and livestock production. Land use change activities, such as the clearance 
  of forests by burning and cultivation to provide more land for agricultural 
  production with subsequent soil degradation, are also major contributors (<a href="155.htm">Chapter 
  4</a>). Carbon sequestration by soils continues to be quantified and estimates 
  refined further, including the effects from reducing organic matter losses by 
  changing to minimum tillage techniques. Improved farm management can result 
  in lower emissions of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O and increased soil carbon 
  uptake.</p>
<p>New energy saving technologies, such as ice bank refrigeration for milk cooling 
  (CAE, 1996), continue to be developed, but need to be widely implemented if 
  they are going to have any significant effects on global greenhouse gas emissions. 
  Methods to reduce emissions by the agricultural sector are outlined in <a href="117.htm#364">Section 
  3.6.4</a>. Energy crop production continues to provide a possible alternative land 
  use where suitable land is available and markets exist for the products.</p>
<a name="363"></a> 
<h3>3.6.3 Historic and Future Trends</h3>
<p>Although on-farm energy intensity (GJ/ha) continues to increase, energy inputs 
  per unit of production (GJ/t) have tended to decline in modern intensive industrialized 
  agricultural systems, mainly caused by increasing crop yields (IPCC, 1996). 
  The current trend in OECD countries is towards less intensive farming systems 
  because of public concerns for animal welfare, reduced chemical inputs, and 
  increasing demand for organically grown food. If this demand continues it could 
  lead to reduced GJ/ha and also to lower GJ/t if yields can be maintained, (though 
  this is generally not the case for low input farming). Conversely, in developing 
  countries energy use (both GJ/ha and GJ/t) is increasing in attempts to increase 
  yields (t/ha) by substituting machinery for manual labour, developing irrigation 
  schemes, and improving crop storage systems to reduce losses. For example, Indian 
  agricultural production has increased threefold since 1970 to 200Mt of food 
  in 1998, whilst during this period animal energy/ha declined 35%, and diesel 
  and electricity inputs increased by over 15 times (Prasad, 1999).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of biotechnology and gene technology could 
  offer new chances to accelerate and support the traditional plant and animal 
  breeding procedures. However, the conflict between food security and environmental 
  risks is yet to be resolved. In developing countries uptake of transgenic technologies 
  would require support of the farmers in adopting non-traditional techniques. 
  If, following a comprehensive risk assessment, public confidence in producing 
  genetically modified organisms is obtained, it could ultimately result in: </p>
<ul>
  <li> yield increases per hectare of food and fibre crops; <br>
  <li> improved performance efficiency of livestock animals; <br>
  <li> reduced inputs of agrio-chemicals and fertilizers because of new resistant 
  cultivars; and<br>
  <li> development of low input cultivars with improved nutrient and water use 
  efficiency. 
</ul>
<p>Energy inputs per unit of product could be reduced by around 10%-20% as a result, 
  and methane and nitrous oxide emissions also lowered. For energy crops, improvements 
  through traditional plant breeding techniques have barely begun. Opportunities 
  for developing high yielding crops more suitable for energy purposes (such as 
  high erucic acid oilseed rape) using genetic engineering techniques by transferring 
  genes through recombinant DNA technology also have potential (Luhs and Friedt, 
  1998). </p>
<p>More difficult to predict are changes in diet and food consumption based on 
  availability, quality, health, and environmental decisions. New protein sources 
  will also impact on land use as will the growing of new crops to provide biomaterials 
  specifically for manufactured products. </p>
<p>Social problems in rural areas continue to occur as does urban drift, particularly 
  in developing countries, resulting from unemployment caused by substitution 
  of manual labour by fossil fuel powered tractors and machinery. Rural economies 
  are also struggling financially (even in developed countries where farm subsidies 
  are available) because of current surpluses of many food and fibre commodities 
  leading to low prices. Therefore, limited funds are available for investment 
  in more modern, less energy intensive equipment. Further evaluation of combining 
  traditional manual techniques with modern crops and scientific knowledge to 
  improve sustainability is required. Possible removal of agricultural subsidies 
  in Europe and the USA is a further threat to the future profitability of these 
  rural regions (which may then need to be stimulated through a government development 
  plan), but could have beneficial effects in terms of reducing greenhouse gas 
  emissions (Storey, 1997). However, it will also be an opportunity for unsubsidized 
  energy crops to compete more successfully with the more traditional uses of 
  the land. </p>
