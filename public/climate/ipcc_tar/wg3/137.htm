<h4>3.8.4.5 Emissions from Production, Transport, Conversion, and Distribution 
</h4>
<p>Methane can be released during the production, transport and use of coal, oil, 
  and gas. Various techniques can be used to reduce these emissions, some of which 
  can be captured for use as an energy resource (Williams, 1993; IEA Greenhouse 
  Gas R&amp;D Programme, 1996, 1997; IGU, 1997, 2000; US EPA, 1993, 1999a).</p>
<p>With coal, methane is trapped in coal seams and surrounding strata in varying 
  amounts and is released as a result of mining. Coal mines are ventilated to 
  dilute the methane as it is released to prevent an explosive build up of the 
  gas. The diluted methane is then normally released to the atmosphere. The emissions 
  can be reduced substantially by capturing some of the methane in a more concentrated 
  form in areas of old workings in a mine or by drilling into the coal seams to 
  release the methane prior to mining, then using it as an energy source. Around 
  50% of emissions from coal mining could be prevented at costs in the range US$1-4/tC<sub>eq</sub> 
  (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme, 1996).</p>
<p>With natural gas, leakage of methane occurs at exploration, through transportation 
  to final use. In North America and Europe, the major source is from fugitive 
  emissions, often leaked from above ground installations or old cast iron or 
  steel pipelines that were originally installed for coal- and oil- derived town 
  gas. Vulnerable networks can be replaced with polyethylene pipes. In Russia, 
  the main sources of leakage are from exploration, compressors, pneumatic devices, 
  and fugitive emissions. Techniques are being applied to reduce emissions including 
  replacing seals, increasing compressor efficiencies, and replacing gas-operated 
  pneumatic devices. Around 45% of global emissions from gas could be eliminated 
  and produce a saving of US$5 billion (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme, 
  1997). A further 10% of gas emissions could be reduced at costs up to US$108/tC<sub>eq</sub>, 
  and a further 15% at costs up to US$135/tC<sub>eq</sub>. However, the cost of 
  emission reduction for old distribution systems remains very high, and the reduction 
  potential will be reached mainly as networks are replaced.</p>
<p>Methane and other gases often occur with oil in the ground and are brought 
  to the surface during extraction. If there was no market for the gas, it was 
  normally vented to the air, but since the1960s methane has increasingly been 
  utilized, compressed and reinjected into the oil field to aid oil production 
  or flared rather than vented. Emissions can be reduced typically by 98% by such 
  methods and these are now common. In Nigeria, where venting is still practised, 
  Shell has made a commitment to end continuous venting by 2003 and continuous 
  flaring by 2008, and has started to liquefy the gas for export.</p>
<p>Sulphur hexafluoride, SF<sub>6</sub>, used as an insulator in electrical transmission 
  equipment, is covered in <a href="107.htm#35">Section 3.5</a>.<br>
