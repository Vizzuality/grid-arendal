<h2>5.6 Research Needs </h2>
<p>The earlier chapters show a significant potential for GHG mitigation in energy 
  and non-energy sectors. All types of barriers limit this potential. These barriers 
  are specific to a technology, sector, and region, and they evolve over time. 
  Research would be useful in several areas to collect data, establish databases, 
  improve methods, and develop computerized models that would help decision makers 
  to devise improved policies and measures to address these barriers: </p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the quantitative global and regional market potential for different 
    categories of mitigation technologies? <a href="089.htm">Chapters 3</a> and 
    <a href="155.htm">4</a> note the technical and socioeconomic potential but 
    a parallel quantitative estimate for market potential is yet to be developed. 
    Data and models that explicitly incorporate barriers to achieving the market 
    potential would be helpful. </li>
  <li>What mix of barriers prevents the adoption of major mitigation technologies? 
    Are social capital and related investment policies more or less important, 
    and how might these vary across cultures and physical environments? What are 
    the decision processes that foster technology transfer? Can technology transfer 
    be managed such as to support sustainable and equitable development? The IPCC-SRTT 
    provides one framework for a technology transfer process. Models of processes 
    that reflect &#147;real world&#148; decision-making are needed, however, in 
    order to identify and elaborate on the barriers that prevent or slow the diffusion 
    of mitigation technologies. The models would also need to take alternative 
    development pathways into consideration. An improved understanding of technology 
    transfer both within and across countries would be required since the actors 
    and barriers tend to be very different.</li>
  <li>What is the appropriate role for stakeholders in the above decision-making 
    processes? The roles of governments and other stakeholders change over time. 
    This is particularly important in sectors where the social, cultural, institutional, 
    and market context is changing rapidly. An identification of their emerging 
    roles would help decision makers manage technology transfer better. </li>
  <li>Does market globalization favour or hamper the diffusion of mitigation technologies? 
    Does environmental regulation confer to firms and nations a long-term technological 
    advantage? Market globalization offers opportunity to plant seeds of mitigation 
    technologies that are less GHG intensive, but it could also bring about proliferation 
    of polluting technologies. It is important to understand the ongoing processes 
    and to determine ways to assist the transfer of less GHG-intensive technologies.</li>
</ul>
