<h2>6.1 Introduction </h2>
<h3><a name="611"></a>6.1.1 Introduction and Key Questions</h3>
<p>The main purpose of this chapter is to discuss the various policies and measures 
  in relation to the different criteria that can be used to assess them, on the 
  basis of the most recent literature. There is obviously a relatively heavy focus 
  on the Kyoto instruments, because they focus on climate policy, have been agreed 
  since the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR; IPCC, 1996, Section 11.5), and 
  the extent of their envisaged international application is unprecedented. Wherever 
  feasible, political economic, legal, and institutional elements are discussed 
  insofar as they are relevant to the implementation of policies and measures. 
  To make both theoretical and practical points the chapter offers occasional 
  examples of policy instrument application, but the effort in this regard is 
  limited by the existing literature, which is weighted towards the experience 
  of industrialized countries.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#4","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>4</sup></small></a> 
</p>
<p>The chapter does not systematically discuss policies and measures typically 
  used to encourage sector-specific technologies; such policies and measures are 
  described in Chapters <a href="089.htm">3</a>, <a href="155.htm">4</a>, and 
  <a href="179.htm">5</a>. The emphasis is on the general description and assessment 
  of policies and measures.</p>
<h3><a name="612"></a>6.1.2 Types of Policies, Measures, and Instruments</h3>
<p>A country can choose from a large set of policies, measures, and instruments 
  to limit domestic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or enhance sequestration by 
  sinks. These include (in arbitrary order): (1) taxes on emissions, carbon, and/or 
  energy, (2) tradable permits<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#5","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>5</sup></small></a> 
  , (3) subsidies<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#6","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>6</sup></small></a> 
  , (4) deposit&#150;refund systems, (5) voluntary agreements (VAs), (6) non-tradable 
  permits, (7) technology and performance standards, (8) product bans, and (9) 
  direct government spending and investment. Definitions of these instruments 
  are provided in <a href="#box61">Box 6.1</a>. The first four are often called 
  market-based instruments, although some VAs also fall into this category.</p>

    <td class="box"><b>Box 6.1. Definitions of Selected National Greenhouse Gas 
      Abatement Policy Instruments </b> 
      <ul>
        <li>An emissions tax is a levy imposed by a government on each unit of 
          emissions by a source subject to the tax. Since virtually all of the 
          carbon in fossil fuels ultimately is emitted as CO<sub>2</sub>, a levy 
          on the carbon content of fossil fuels&#150;a carbon tax&#150;is equivalent 
          to an emissions tax for emissions caused by fossil fuel combustion. 
          An energy tax&#150;a levy on the energy content of fuels&#150;reduces 
          the demand for energy and so reduces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions through 
          fossil fuel use.<br>
        </li>
        <li>A tradable permit (cap-and-trade) system establishes a limit on aggregate 
          emissions by specified sources, requires each source to hold permits 
          equal to its actual emissions, and allows permits to be traded among 
          sources. This is different from a credit system, in which credits are 
          created when a source reduces its emissions below a baseline equal to 
          an estimate of what they would have been in the absence of the emissions 
          reduction action. A source subject to an emissions-limitation commitment 
          can use credits to meet its obligation.<br>
        </li>
        <li>A subsidy is a direct payment from the government to an entity, or 
          a tax reduction to that entity, for implementing a practice the government 
          wishes to encourage. GHG emissions can be reduced by lowering existing 
          subsidies that in effect raise emissions, such as subsidies to fossil 
          fuel use, or by providing subsidies for practices that reduce emissions 
          or enhance sinks (e.g., for insulation of buildings or planting trees).<br>
        </li>
        <li>A deposit&#150;refund system combines a deposit or fee (tax) on a 
          commodity with a refund or rebate (subsidy) for implementation of a 
          specified action.<br>
        </li>
        <li>A VA is an agreement between a government authority and one or more 
          private parties, as well as a unilateral commitment that is recognized 
          by the public authority, to achieve environmental objectives or to improve 
          environmental performance beyond compliance.<br>
        </li>
        <li>A non-tradable permit system establishes a limit on the GHG emissions 
          of each regulated source. Each source must keep its actual emissions 
          below its own limit; trading among sources is not permitted.<br>
        </li>
        <li>A technology or performance standard establishes minimum requirements 
          for products or processes to reduce GHG emissions associated with the 
          manufacture or use of the products or processes.<br>
        </li>
        <li>A product ban prohibits the use of a specified product in a particular 
          application, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in refrigeration systems, 
          that gives rise to GHG emissions.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Direct government spending and investment involves government expenditures 
          on research and development (R&amp;D) measures to lower GHG emissions 
          or enhance GHG sinks.</li>

<p>A group of countries that want to limit their collective GHG emissions could 
  agree to implement one, or a mix, of instruments. These are (in arbitrary order):</p>
<ul>
  <li>tradable quotas;<br>
  </li>
  <li>Joint Implementation (JI);<br>
  </li>
  <li>the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM);<br>

  <li>direct international transfers of financial resources and technology. </li>

      <ul>
        <li>A tradable quota system establishes national emissions limits for 
          each participating country and requires each country to hold quota equal 
          to its actual emissions. Governments, and possibly legal entities, of 
          participating countries are allowed to trade quotas. Emissions trading 
          under Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol is a tradable quota system based 
          on the assigned amounts (AAs) calculated from the emissions reduction 
          and limitation commitments listed in Annex B of the Protocol.<br>
        </li>
        <li>JI allows the government of, or entities from, a country with a GHG 
          emissions limit to contribute to the implementation of a project to 
          reduce emissions, or enhance sinks, in another country with a national 
          commitment and to receive emission reduction units (ERUs) equal to part, 
          or all, of the emissions reduction achieved. The ERUs can be used by 
          the investor country or another Annex I party to help meet its national 
          emissions limitation commitment. Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol establishes 
          JI among Parties with emissions reduction and limitation commitments 
          listed in Annex B of the Protocol.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The CDM allows the government of, or entities from, a country with 
          a GHG emissions limit to contribute to the implementation of a project 
          to reduce emissions, or possibly enhance sinks, in a country with no 
          national commitment and to receive CERs equal to part, or all, of the 
          emissions reductions achieved. Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol establishes 
          the CDM to contribute to sustainable development of the host country 
          and to help Annex I Parties meet their emissions reduction and limitation 
          commitments.<br>
        </li>
        <li>A harmonized tax on emissions, carbon, and/or energy commits participating 
          countries to impose a tax at a common rate on the same sources.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
          Each country can retain the tax revenue it collects.<br>
        </li>
        <li>An international tax on emissions, carbon, and/or energy is a tax 
          imposed on specified sources in participating countries by an international 
          agency. The revenue is distributed or used as specified by participant 
          countries or the international agency.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Non-tradable quotas impose a limit on the national GHG emissions of 
          each participating country to be attained exclusively through domestic 
          actions.<br>
        </li>
        <li>International product and/or technology standards establish minimum 
          requirements for the affected products and/or technologies in countries 
          in which they are adopted. The standards reduce GHG emissions associated 
          with the manufacture or use of the products and/or application of the 
          technology.<br>
        </li>
        <li>An international VA is an agreement between two or more governments 
          and one or more entities to limit GHG emissions or to implement measures 
          that will have this effect.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Direct international transfers of financial resources and technology 
          involve transfers of financial resources from a national government 
          to the government or legal entity in another country, directly or via 
          an international agency, with the objective of stimulating GHG emissions 
          reduction or sink enhancement actions in the recipient country.</li>
