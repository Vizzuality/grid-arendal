<p><b><a name="1"></a><sup>1</sup></b> The selection 
  of 550ppmv scenarios is based on the relatively large number of available studies 
  that use this level and does not imply any endorsement of this particular level 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration stabilization.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="2"></a><sup>2</sup></b> It is 
  perhaps worth noting in this connection that, in a similar way, the IPCC had 
  originally recommended that climate and other modellers use the full set of 
  IS92 scenarios but, in practice, this advice has not been followed by most researchers 
  who have focussed primarily on the &#147;central&#148; IS92 case, thereby potentially 
  contributing to an unjustified sense of probability or accuracy.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="3"></a><sup>3</sup></b> Some 
  climate polices have multiple benefits. For example, a particular policy designed 
  to reduce methane leaks from natural gas systems may also increase the operating 
  company&#146;s profitability and improve safety. However, if this policy was 
  originally developed to reduce emissions it should be classified as a climate 
  policy, not as a policy to increase profitability or improve safety.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="4"></a><sup>4</sup></b> Such 
  targets may be reached without specific additional climate policies, e.g., by 
  pursuing particular development pathways.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="5"></a><sup>5</sup></b> This 
  closer look at 550ppmv CO<sub>2</sub> stabilization scenarios is solely based 
  on the frequency of their occurrence in the literature, which in turn has been 
  influenced by frequent reference to this level in the policy area (e.g., it 
  has been selected as a long-term target by the European Union). The discussion 
  in this chapter does not imply any endorsement of this particular level as a 
  policy target. There is a need for analysis of the feasibility and implications 
  of stabilization levels other than 550 ppmv.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="6"></a><sup>6</sup></b> The usual 
  form of the Kaya identity separates the GDP term into population &yen; GDP/capita. 
  However, population assumptions were not provided for most scenarios and thus 
  the GDP term was not disaggregated.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="7"></a><sup>7</sup></b> For a 
  more detailed discussion of the WRE and WGI trajectories, see <a href="319.htm">Chapters 
  8</a> and <a href="379.htm">10</a> of this report.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="8"></a><sup>8</sup></b> In part 
  this is an artefact of the structure of the models, which can- not easily account 
  for changes in social and technological structure such as significant changes 
  in consumption patterns, land use, or urban form.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="9"></a><sup>9</sup></b> The macroeconomic 
  cost is defined here as the reduction of GDP caused by GHG emission reduction 
  in comparison to baseline GDP. It should be noted that these costs do not take 
  into account the benefits that would occur from avoiding climate change-related 
  damages or any co-benefits. See also <a href="266.htm">Chapters 7</a> and 
  <a href="319.htm">8</a> for a discussion of these issues.<br>

  <b><a name="11"></a><sup>11</sup></b> The 
  literature contains a great many scenarios that focus on specific countries 
  or regions. However, time and space limitations precluded including these scenarios 
  in this review.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="12"></a><sup>12</sup></b> Balanced 
  is defined as not relying too heavily on one particular energy source, on the 
  assumption that similar improvement rates apply to all energy supply and end-use 
  technologies.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="13"></a><sup>13</sup></b> Enting 
  <i>et al</i>. (1994) selected the timings to reach alternative target levels in 2100 
  year for 450ppmv, 2150 year for 550 ppmv, 2200 year for 650ppmv, and 2250 year 
  for 750ppmv. Post-SRES modellers selected only the year 2150 for all the stabilization 
  targets; this decision was a consequence of the tight time constraints the modelling 
  teams faced for preparation of the scenarios. As a result, 450ppmv stabilization 
  scenarios of post-SRES require slightly more reductions of CO<sub>2</sub> than 
  those of IPCC (1995), while 650 and 750ppmv stabilization scenarios of post-SRES 
  require slightly less reductions than those of IPCC (1995), both during the 
  period from now to 2150.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="14"></a><sup>14</sup></b> The 
  100% reduction scenario based on LDNE assumes the large scale introduction of 
  carbon sequestration technologies.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="15"></a><sup>15</sup></b> It 
  should be noted, however, that a few scenarios show the possibility of achieving 
  450ppmv stabilization even if the initial Kyoto commitments are not met, provided 
  that emissions decline sufficiently by 2020.<br>
