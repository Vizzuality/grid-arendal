<p>Another observation is that adaptation options are typically analyzed for a 
  given amount of climate change independent of mitigation considerations (Fankhauser, 
  1996). Here the aim is to find the amount of adaptation necessary to minimize 
  the net damage that results from a given level of climate change. Analysts often 
  include predetermined adaptation options in an ad-hoc manner, and so there is 
  a tendency to underestimate adaptive capacity. These analyses have been widely 
  carried out and are reasonably well understood in the field of agricultural 
  and coastal impacts, at least in some developed countries (Fankhauser, 1995a; 
  Yohe <i>et al</i>. 1996; Mendelsohn and Schlesinger, 1997; Mendelsohn and Neumann, 
  1999).</p>
<p>In general, the integrated analysis of adaptation options is a rather complex 
  process because all socioeconomic trends affect the vulnerability to climate 
  change and vulnerability determines the optimal level of adaptation. Even without 
  adaptation, impact assessments vary depending on the socioeconomic development 
  projected for the future. Studies that examine the avoided damage under different 
  emissions reduction targets (<i>i.e</i>., different costs of mitigation) and 
  compare them with the costs of adaptation options are yet to be developed.</p>
<p>Giving policy advice on the basis of the efficiency concept within the IAM 
  framework is often difficult, partly because IAMs capture only some elements 
  of the potential coping strategies and are, thus, biased towards mitigation 
  activities, and partly because damage estimates still have a rather low confidence 
  (Tol, 1999a, 1999b). Nevertheless, IAMs are a useful tool in exploring the implications 
  of new types of policies. They help to manage scientific knowledge and give 
  insights into the major driving forces for present and future development with 
  respect to social, economic, and ecological structures (Rotmans and Dowlatabadi, 
  1998).</p>
<p>The critical aspect of the efficiency approach is that it is only partially 
  optimal because the level of climate change, which depends on the level of mitigation, 
  is exogenous (Callaway <i>et al</i>., 1998). Thus, this approach does not take into 
  account that the emissions causing climate change are the result of externalities 
  and therefore are not optimal. From this perspective, to correct the emissions&#146; 
  externality through mitigation is the first answer. However, the need for adaptation 
  measures remains valid because of the adverse climate change effects that are 
  already unavoidable. Strategies that incorporate both mitigation and adaptation 
  are likely to be more efficient for limiting the damages of climate change than 
  strategies that pursue only one or the other form of action.</p>
<p>Also, the efficiency criterion is often criticized because economic efficiency 
  is not necessarily the only aim decision makers, economic agents, and governments 
  wants to pursue, and it does not account for ecological systems and subsistence 
  agriculture entirely outside the market sector. Distributional aspects of burden-sharing 
  schemes and culturally determined risk preferences also play an important role 
  in resource-allocation decisions.</p>
