<h3>9.2.9 Services<br>
</h3>
<p>Since services employ more people and since they are much more employment-intensive 
  than energy and manufacturing, employment usually increases as a result of GHG 
  mitigation. However, the effects are small and diffused, and there is hardly 
  any literature on specific sectoral effects for the service industries apart 
  from the multisectoral studies reviewed in section <a href="356.htm#921">9.2.1</a> 
  above. </p>
<h3>9.2.10 Households</h3>
<p>The impact of mitigation on households comes directly through changes in the 
  technology and price of household use of energy for heat, light, and power, 
  and indirectly through macroeconomic effects, particularly on the income of 
  households and the employment of their members. An important ancillary benefit 
  for households is the potential improvement in quality of indoor, local, and 
  regional air. <br>
</p>
<p>Most studies analyze the effect of mitigation strategies on GDP, which is often 
  taken as an indicator of welfare. However, this measure does not capture the 
  effects on the distribution of income between households. There are some studies 
  that look at private consumption and other constructed indices of welfare, but 
  these are few in number. This literature concentrates more on the developed 
  economies, as these are the countries that would be taking actions first to 
  reduce the emissions. The effect on developing economies is indirect through 
  the trade effects and energy price effect. </p>
<h4><a name="92101"></a>9.2.10.1 Distributional Effects of Mitigation</h4>
<p>These are mainly discussed in <a href="319.htm">Chapter 8</a> (<a href="332.htm">Section 
  8.2.2.3</a>). There are a number of studies on the domestic income distributional 
  effects of carbon taxation, mostly for developed countries (Johnson <i><i>et al</i></i>., 
  1990; Chandler and Nicholls, 1990; Poterba, 1991; Bertram <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1993; 
  Hamilton and Cameron, 1994; Symons <i><i>et al</i></i>., 1994; Cornwall and Creedy, 
  1996). These studies show a regressive effect of carbon taxes, but a progressive 
  effect if revenues are returned to disadvantaged groups. As the share of household 
  expenditure on energy and the dependence on high-carbon fuels of the lower income 
  groups is high, the impact of a carbon tax would be disproportionately higher 
  on these lower income groups (Goldemberg and Johansson, 1995; Yamasaki and Tominaga, 
  1997). Barker and K&ograve;hler (1998) review a number of studies on impact 
  of carbon taxation on households. Their analysis of an EU carbon tax indicates 
  that taxation on domestic energy is regressive and taxation on road fuels is 
  weakly progressive. They also show that revenues recycled through employer taxes 
  could increase disposable income for all income groups in the study.</p>
<h4><a name="92102"></a>9.2.10.2 Electricity and Demand-side Management</h4>
<p>A number of studies point out that power sector deregulation and competition 
  will improve the efficiency of operations as well as management, which will 
  result in a reduction in electricity rate charged to the end users (Hsu and 
  Tchen, 1997). Demand-side management (DSM) instituted by electric utilities 
  would increase electricity prices, but could lead to a reduction in total bills 
  to participating customers (Hirst and Hadley, 1995), although the increased 
  electricity prices could deter companies from using these measures in a competitive 
  market. Parker (1995) indicated that DSM measures could lead to job creation 
  from production and installation of equipment. <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="92103"></a>9.2.10.3 Effects of Improvement in Energy Efficiency<br>
</h4>
<p>Improvements in the efficiency of energy production may have substantial impacts 
  on households. Bashmakov (1993) reports a reduction in energy bills for end 
  users and a substantial reduction in environmental costs for Russia. The study 
  also reports that every rouble invested in energy efficiency generates 5 times 
  more jobs than investments in energy production. On the other hand, Gaj <i>et 
  al</i>. (1997) report a high social cost of economic transition caused by macroeconomic 
  reforms, which indirectly reduce GHG emissions, because employment in non-competitive 
  sectors is high in Poland.</p>
