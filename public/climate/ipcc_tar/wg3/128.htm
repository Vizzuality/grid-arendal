<h4>3.8.4.2 Nuclear Power</h4>
<a name="38421"></a> 
<h4>3.8.4.2.1 Present Situation</h4>
<p>Nuclear power is a mature technology with 434 nuclear reactors operating in 
  32 countries in 1999, with a total capacity of around 349GW<sub>e</sub> generating 
  2,398 TWh or some 16% of global electricity generation in 1999 (IAEA, 2000b). 
  In general, the majority of current nuclear power plants worldwide are competitive 
  on a marginal cost basis in a deregulated market environment<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#20","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>20</sup></small></a>.</p>
<p>The life cycle GHG emissions per kWh from nuclear power plants are two orders 
  of magnitude lower than those of fossil-fuelled electricity generation and comparable 
  to most renewables (EC, 1995; Krewitt <i>et al</i>., 1999; Br&auml;nnstr&ouml;m-Norberg 
  <i>et al</i>., 1996; Spadaro <i>et al</i>., 2000). Hence it is an effective GHG mitigation 
  option, especially by way of investments in the lifetime extension of existing 
  plants.</p>
<p>Whether or not nuclear power would be accepted in the market place depends 
  on new capacities becoming economically competitive and on its ability to restore 
  public confidence in its safe use. </p>
<a name="38422"></a> 
<h4>3.8.4.2.2 Nuclear Economics</h4>
<p>Where gas supply infrastructures are already in place, new nuclear power plants 
  at US$1700&#150;US$3100/kW<sub>e</sub> (Paffenberger and Bertel, 1998) cannot 
  compete against natural gas-fuelled CCGT technology at current and expected 
  gas prices (OECD, 1998b). Nuclear power can be competitive versus coal and natural 
  gas, especially if coal has to be transported over long distances or natural 
  gas infrastructures are not in place. Discount rates are often critical in tilting 
  the competitive balance between nuclear power and coal. A study (OECD, 1998b) 
  surveyed the costs of nuclear, coal, and natural gas-fuelled electricity generation 
  in 18 countries for plants that would go into operation in 2005. The results, 
  estimated for both 5% and 10% discount rates, showed that nuclear power is the 
  least cost option in seven countries at a 5% discount rate (generating cost 
  range US$0.025&#150;0.057/kWh), but only in two countries at a 10% discount 
  rate (generating cost range US$ 0.039&#150;0.080/kWh). In fully deregulated 
  markets such as the UK&#146;s, rates of return in excess of 14% have been required 
  at which level new nuclear plant construction would not be competitive at current 
  fossil fuel market prices<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#21","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>21</sup></small></a>.</p>

<h4>3.8.4.2.3 Waste Disposal</h4>
<p>Technological approaches for safe and long-term disposal of high-level radioactive 
  waste have been extensively studied (Posiva Oy, 1999; EC, 1999). One possible 
  solution involves deep geological repositories, however, no country has yet 
  disposed of any spent fuel or high-level waste in such a repository because 
  of public and political opposition (NEA, 1999). Several countries are actively 
  researching this issue. Long-term disposal of radioactive wastes should not 
  be an intractable problem from a technical perspective, because of the small 
  quantities of storage space required (Goldemberg, 2000; Rhodes and Beller, 2000). 
  Radioactive waste storage density limits defined for storing light water reactor 
  (LWR) fuel at Yucca Mountain are about 41 m<sup>2</sup>/MW<sub>e</sub> of nuclear 
  generating capacity for a power plant over its expected 30 years of operating 
  life<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn3.htm#22","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>22</sup></small></a> 
  (Kadak, 1999). High level waste volumes can be further reduced if spent fuel 
  is reprocessed so that most of the plutonium and unused uranium is extracted 
  for reuse. The remaining high-level waste is compacted and &#147;vitrified&#148; 
  (melted with other ingredients to make a glassy matrix), and placed into canisters 
  that are appropriate for long-term disposal. However, reprocessing of spent 
  fuel and the separation of plutonium are often viewed as potentially opening 
  the door for nuclear weapons proliferation. For this and economic reasons, several 
  countries therefore prefer once-through fuel cycles and direct disposal of spent 
  reactor fuel. </p>
<p>Because of the low waste volumes, it may be plausible to accumulate high level 
  radioactive wastes in a few sites globally rather than every country seeking 
  national solutions (Goldemberg, 2000) These international repositories would 
  be operated and controlled by an international organization which would also 
  assume the responsibility of safeguarding these sites (McCombie, 1999a; 1999b; 
  McCombie <i>et al</i>., 1999; Miller <i>et al</i>., 1999). For the time being, most governments 
  remain committed to identifying suitable high-level waste disposal or interim 
  storage solutions within their own national territories.</p>
<p>In the longer run, fundamentally new reactor configurations may need to be 
  developed that are based on innovative designs that integrate inherent operating 
  safety features and waste disposal using previously generated radioactive waste 
  as fuel and, by way of transmutation, convert nuclear waste or plutonium to 
  less hazardous and short-lived isotopic substances (Rubbia, 1998). </p>
<p>Present technology can be used to reduce the growth of the plutonium stocks 
  by use of mixed plutonium/uranium oxide fuels (MOX) in thermal reactors. Belgium, 
  France, Germany, and Switzerland use MOX fuels in existing reactors. Japan also 
  has been progressing its MOX utilizing programme.<br>
