<h4>7.4.2.3 Employment </h4>
<p>This section deals with the valuation of employment impacts on a project basis. 
  If a project creates jobs, it benefits society to the extent that the person 
  employed would otherwise not have been employed or would have been employed 
  doing something of lower value. Conversely, if the project reduces employment 
  there is a corresponding social cost. These benefits depend primarily on the 
  period that a person is employed, what state support is offered during any period 
  of unemployment, and what opportunities there are for informal activities that 
  generate income in cash or kind. In addition, unemployment is known to create 
  health problems, which have to be considered as part of the social cost. </p>
<p>A physical measure of the extent of the employment created is therefore an 
  important task of any project assessment in an area where there is unemployment.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#16","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>16</sup></small></a> 
  The data that have to be estimated are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>number of persons to be employed in the projects;<br>
  </li>
  <li>duration for which they are employed;<br>
  </li>
  <li>present occupations of the individuals (including no formal occupation); 
    and<br>
  </li>
  <li>gender and age (if available).</li>
</ul>
<p>This physical information can be used in the multi-attribute selection criteria 
  discussed in <a href="271.htm#721">Section 7.2.1</a> (<a href="272.htm#box71">Box 
  7.1</a>). In addition, however, it is possible to place some money value on 
  the employment, or to deduct from the payments made to the workers the value 
  of the benefits of the reduced unemployment.</p>
<p>Before considering the framework for such an evaluation, it is important to 
  set out the theoretical reasons for arguing that unemployment reduction has 
  a social value. In neoclassic economic analysis, no social cost is normally 
  associated with unemployment. The presumption is that the economy is effectively 
  fully employed, and that any measured unemployment results from matching the 
  changing demand for labour to a changing supply. In a well-functioning and stable 
  market, individuals can anticipate periods when they will be out of work, as 
  they leave one job and move to another. Consequently, the terms of labour employment 
  contracts, as well as the terms of unemployment insurance, reflect the presence 
  of such periods, and there is no cost to society from the existence of a pool 
  of such unemployed workers. However, these conditions are far from the reality 
  in most of the developing and some of the developed countries in which the GHG 
  projects will be undertaken. Many of those presently unemployed have poor prospects 
  of employment.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, therefore, it seems entirely appropriate to treat the 
  welfare gain of those made employed as a social gain. For developed economies 
  this welfare gain is calculated as follows (Kirkpatrick and MacArthur, 1990):</p>
<ol>
  <li type="a"> gain of net income as a result of a new job, after allowing for 
    any unemployment benefit, informal employment, work-related expenses, etc.; 
    minus<br>
  </li>
  <li type="a"> the value of the additional time that the person has at his or her disposal 
    as a result of being unemployed and that is lost as a result of being employed; 
    plus<br>
  </li>
  <li type="a"> the value of any health-related consequences of being unemployed that are 
    no longer incurred.</li>
</ol>
<p>To calculate the social benefits (the unemployment avoided as a result of the 
  project), the welfare cost ((a) minus (b) plus (c)) has to be multiplied by 
  the period of employment created by the project.<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn7.htm#17","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>17</sup></small></a> 
  The above method can also be applied to obtain employment benefit estimates 
  for projects in developing countries (see, e.g., Markandya, 1998).</p>
