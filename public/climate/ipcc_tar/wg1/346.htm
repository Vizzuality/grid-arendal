<p><a name="fig92"></a>A climate change simulation produces a time evolving three 
  dimensional distribution of temperature and other climate variables. For the 
  real system or for a model, and taking temperature as an example, this is expressed 
  as T = T<sub>0</sub> + T<sub>0</sub>' for pre-industrial equilibrium conditions. 
  T is now the full temperature field rather than the global mean temperature 
  change of <a href="344.htm#921">Section 9.2.1</a>. T<sub>0</sub> represents 
  the temperature structure of the mean climate, which is determined by the (pre-industrial) 
  forcing, and T<sub>0</sub>' the internally generated random natural variability 
  with zero mean. For climate which is changing as a consequence of increasing 
  atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations or other forcing changes, T = T<sub>0</sub> 
  + T<sub>f</sub> + T' where T<sub>f</sub> is the deterministic climate change 
  caused by the changing forcing, and T' is the natural variability under these 
  changing conditions. Changes in the statistics of the natural variability, that 
  is in the statistics of T<sub>0</sub>' vs T', are of considerable interest and 
  are discussed in <a href="359.htm">Sections 9.3.5</a> and <a href="364.htm">9.3.6</a> 
  which treat changes in variability and extremes.</p>
<p>The difference in temperature between the control and climate change simulations 
  is written as <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-l.gif" width="8" height="8">T = T<sub>f</sub> 
  + (T' - T<sub>0</sub>') = T<sub>f</sub> + T'', and is a combination of the deterministic 
  signal T<sub>f</sub> and a random component T'' = T' - T<sub>0</sub>' which 
  has contributions from the natural variability of both simulations. A similar 
  expression arises when calculating climate change as the difference between 
  an earlier and a later period in the observations or a simulation. Observed 
  and simulated climate change are the sum of the forced "signal" and 
  the natural variability "noise" and it is important to be able to 
  separate the two. The natural variability that obscures the forced signal may 
  be at least partially reduced by averaging. </p>
<h4><a name="9222"></a>9.2.2.2 Ensembles and averaging</h4>
<p>An ensemble consists of a number of simulations undertaken with the same forcing 
  scenario, so that the forced change Tf is the same for each, but where small 
  perturbations to remote initial conditions result in internally generated climate 
  variability that is different for each ensemble member. Small ensembles of simulations 
  have been performed with a number of models as indicated in the "number 
  of simulations" column in <a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a>. Averaging 
  over the ensemble of results, indicated by braces, gives the ensemble mean climate 
  change as {<img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-l.gif" width="8" height="8">T} = T<sub>f</sub> 
  + {T''}. For independent realisations, the natural variability noise is reduced 
  by the ensemble averaging (averaging to zero for a large enough ensemble) so 
  that {<img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-l.gif" width="8" height="8">T} is an improved estimate 
  of the model's forced climate change Tf. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig92">Figure 
  9.2</a>, which shows the simulated temperature differences from 1975 to 1995 
  to the first decade in the 21st century for three climate change simulations 
  made with the same model and the same forcing scenario but starting from slightly 
  different initial conditions more than a century earlier. The differences between 
  the simulations reflect differences in the natural variability. The ensemble 
  average over the three realisations, also shown in the diagram, is an estimate 
  of the model's forced climate change where some of this natural variability 
  has been averaged out.</p>
<p>The ensemble variance for a particular model, assuming there is no correlation 
  between the forced component and the variability, is <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/sigma-s.gif" width="8" height="8"><sup>2</sup><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-l.gif" width="8" height="8">T

  which gives a measure of the natural variability noise. The "signal to 
  noise ratio", {<img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-l.gif" width="8" height="8">T}/ <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/sigma-s.gif" width="8" height="8"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-l.gif" width="8" height="8">T 
  , compares the strength of the climate change signal to this natural variability 
  noise. The signal stands out against the noise when and where this ratio is 
  large. The signal will be better represented by the ensemble mean as the size 
  of the ensemble grows and the noise is averaged out over more independent realisations. 
  This is indicated by the width, {<img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-l.gif" width="8" height="8">T}

  confidence interval which decreases as the ensemble size n increases. </p>
<p>The natural variability may be further reduced by averaging over more realisations, 
  over longer time intervals, and by averaging in space, although averaging also 
  affects the information content of the result. In what follows, the geographical 
  distributions <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-l.gif" width="8" height="8">T, zonal averages

  and other variables are discussed. As the amount of averaging increases, the 
  climate change signal is better defined, since the noise is increasingly averaged 
  out, but the geographical information content is reduced.</p>
