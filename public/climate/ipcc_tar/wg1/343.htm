<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>In 1996, the IPCC began the development of a new set of emissions scenarios, 
  effectively to update and replace the well-known IS92 scenarios. The approved 
  new set of scenarios is described in the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios 
  (SRES) (Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al., 2000; see more complete discussion 
  of SRES scenarios and forcing in <a href="095.htm">Chapters 3</a>, <a href="127.htm">4</a>, 
  <a href="160.htm">5</a> and <a href="212.htm">6</a>). Four different narrative 
  storylines were developed to describe consistently the relationships between 
  emission driving forces and their evolution and to add context for the scenario 
  quantification (see <a href="#box91">Box 9.1</a>). The resulting set of forty 
  scenarios (thirty-five of which contain data on the full range of gases required 
  for climate modelling) cover a wide range of the main demographic, economic 
  and technological driving forces of future greenhouse gas and sulphur emissions. 
  Each scenario represents a specific quantification of one of the four storylines. 
  All the scenarios based on the same storyline constitute a scenario "family". 
  (See <a href="#box91">Box 9.1</a>, which briefly describes the main characteristics 
  of the four SRES storylines and scenario families.) The SRES scenarios do not 
  include additional climate initiatives, which means that no scenarios are included 
  that explicitly assume implementation of the UNFCCC or the emissions targets 
  of the Kyoto Protocol. However, greenhouse gas emissions are directly affected 
  by non-climate change policies designed for a wide range of other purposes. 
  Furthermore, government policies can, to varying degrees, influence the greenhouse 
  gas emission drivers and this influence is broadly reflected in the storylines 
  and resulting scenarios.</p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 9.1: The Emissions Scenarios of the Special Report 
        on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) </b> </div>
      <p>A1. The A1 storyline and scenario family describe a future world of very 
        rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and 
        declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient 
        technologies. Major underlying themes are convergence among regions, capacity 
        building and increased cultural and social interactions, with a substantial 
        reduction in regional differences in per capita income. The A1 scenario 
        family develops into three groups that describe alternative directions 
        of technological change in the energy system. The three A1 groups are 
        distinguished by their technological emphasis: fossil intensive (A1FI), 
        non-fossil energy sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources (A1B) 
        (where balanced is defined as not relying too heavily on one particular 
        energy source, on the assumption that similar improvement rates apply 
        to all energy supply and end use technologies).</p>
      <p>A2. The A2 storyline and scenario family describe a very heterogeneous 
        world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local 
        identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which 
        results in continuously increasing population. Economic development is 
        primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and technological 
        change are more fragmented and slower than in other storylines.</p>
      <p>B1. The B1 storyline and scenario family describe a convergent world 
        with the same global population, that peaks in mid-century and declines 
        thereafter, as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid change in economic 
        structures toward a service and information economy, with reductions in 
        material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient 
        technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social 
        and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without 
        additional climate initiatives.</p>
      <p>B2. The B2 storyline and scenario family describe a world in which the 
        emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability. 
        It is a world with continuously increasing global population, at a rate 
        lower than A2, intermediate levels of economic development, and less rapid 
        and more diverse technological change than in the B1 and A1 storylines. 
        While the scenario is also oriented towards environmental protection and 
        social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels.</p>

<p>Because SRES was not approved until 15 March 2000, it was too late for the 
  modelling community to incorporate the scenarios into their models and have 
  the results available in time for this Third Assessment Report. Therefore, in 
  accordance with a decision of the IPCC Bureau in 1998 to release draft scenarios 
  to climate modellers (for their input to the Third Assessment Report) one marker 
  scenario was chosen from each of four of the scenario groups based on the storylines 
  (A1B, A2, B1 and B2) (<a href="#box91">Box 9.1</a>). The choice of the markers 
  was based on which initial quantification best reflected the storyline, and 
  features of specific models. Marker scenarios are no more or less likely than 
  any other scenarios but these scenarios have received the closest scrutiny. 
  Scenarios were also selected later to illustrate the other two scenario groups 
  (A1FI and A1T), hence there is an illustrative scenario for each of the six 
  scenario groups. These latter two illustrative scenarios were not selected in 
  time for AOGCM models to utilise them in this report. In fact, time and computer 
  resource limitations dictated that most modelling groups could run only A2 and 
  B2, and results from those integrations are evaluated in this chapter. However, 
  results for all six illustrative scenarios are shown here using a simple climate 
  model discussed below. The IS92a scenario is also used in a number of the results 
  presented in this chapter in order to provide direct comparison with the results 
  in the SAR.</p>
<p>The final four marker scenarios contained in SRES differ in minor ways from 
  the draft scenarios used for the AOGCM experiments described in this report. 
  In order to ascertain the likely effect of differences in the draft and final 
  SRES scenarios each of the four draft and final marker scenarios were studied 
  using a simple climate model tuned to the AOGCMs used in this report. For three 
  of the four marker scenarios (A1B, A2 and B2) temperature change from the draft 
  and final scenarios are very similar. The primary difference is a change to 
  the standardised values for 1990 to 2000, which is common to all these scenarios. 
  This results in a higher forcing early in the period. There are further small 
  differences in net forcing, but these decrease until, by 2100, differences in 
  temperature change in the two versions of these scenarios are in the range 1 
  to 2%. For the B1 scenario, however, temperature change is significantly lower 
  in the final version, leading to a difference in the temperature change in 2100 
  of almost 20%, as a result of generally lower emissions across the full range 
  of greenhouse gases. For descriptions of the simulations, see <a href="349.htm#931">Section 
  9.3.1</a>.</p>
