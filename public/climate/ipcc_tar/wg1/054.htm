<p>Since the DTR is the maximum temperature minus the minimum temperature, the 
  DTR can decrease when the trend in the maximum or minimum temperature is downward, 
  upward, or unchanging. This contributes to less spatial coherence on the DTR 
  map than on maps of mean temperature trend. Maximum temperatures have increased 
  over most areas with the notable exception of eastern Canada, the southern United 
  States, portions of Eastern and southern Europe (Brunetti et al., 2000a), southern 
  China, and parts of southern South America. Minimum temperatures, however, increased 
  almost everywhere except in eastern Canada and small areas of Eastern Europe 
  and the Middle East. The DTR decreased in most areas, except over middle Canada, 
  and parts of southern Africa, south-west Asia, Europe, and the western tropical 
  Pacific Islands. In some areas the pattern of temperature change has been different. 
  In both New Zealand (Salinger, 1995) and central Europe (Weber et al., 1994; 
  Br&aacute;zdil et al., 1996) maximum and minimum temperatures have increased 
  at similar rates. In India the DTR has increased due to a decrease in the minimum 
  temperature (Kumar et al., 1994). Eastern Canada also shows a slight increase 
  in DTR (Easterling et al., 1997). However, recently annual mean maximum and 
  minimum temperatures for Canada have been analysed using newly homogenised data 
  (Vincent, 1998; Vincent and Gullet, 1999); these have increased by 0.3 and 0.4&deg;C, 
  respectively, over the last fifty years (Zhang et al., 1999). Central England 
  temperature also shows no decrease in DTR since 1878 (Parker and Horton, 1999). 
  Similarly, a new temperature data set for north-east Spain (not available on 
  <a href="#fig22">Figure 2.2</a> below, Brunet-India et al., 1999a,b), 
  shows an increase in maximum temperature over 1913 to 1998 to be about twice 
  as fast as that of minimum temperature. Recent analyses by Quintana-Gomez (1999) 
  reveal a large reduction in the DTR over Venezuela and Colombia, primarily due 
  to increasing minimum temperatures (up to 0.5&deg;C/decade). In northern China, 
  the decrease in DTR is due to a stronger warming in minimum temperature compared 
  with maximum temperatures. However, in southern China the decreased DTR is due 
  to a cooling in maximum with a slight warming in minimum temperature (Zhai and 
  Ren, 1999).</p>
<p>The DTR is particularly susceptible to urban effects. Gallo et al. (1996) examined 
  differences in DTR between stations based on predominant land use in the vicinity 
  of the observing site. Results show statistically significant differences in 
  DTR between stations associated with predominantly rural land use/land cover 
  and those associated with more urban land use/land cover, with rural settings 
  generally having larger DTR than urban settings. Although this shows that the 
  distinction between urban and rural land use is important as one of the factors 
  that can influence the trends observed in temperatures, <a href="#fig22">Figure 
  2.2</a> shows annual mean trends in diurnal temperature range in worldwide non-urban 
  stations over the period 1950 to 1993 (from Easterling et al., 1997). The trends 
  for both the maximum and minimum temperatures are about 0.005&deg;C/decade smaller 
  than the trends for the full network including urban sites, which is consistent 
  with earlier estimated urban effects on global temperature anomaly time-series 
  (Jones et al., 1990). <br>
  <br>
  Minimum temperature for both hemispheres increased abruptly in the late 1970s, 
  coincident with an apparent change in the character of the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern 
  Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, giving persistently warmer sea temperatures in 
  the tropical central and east Pacific (see <a href="083.htm#262">Section 
  2.6.2</a>). Seasonally, the strongest changes in the DTR were in the boreal 
  winter (-0.13&deg;C/decade for rural stations) and the smallest changes were 
  during boreal summer (-0.065&deg;C/decade), indicating some seasonality in the 
  changes. Preliminary extensions of the Easterling et al. (1997) analysis to 
  1997 show that the declining trends in DTR have continued in much of North America 
  and Asia.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="#fig23">Figure 2.3</a> shows the relationship between 
  cloudiness and the DTR for a number of regions where long-term cloud cover data 
  are available (Dai et al., 1997a). For each region there was an increase in 
  cloud cover over the 20th century and generally a decrease in DTR. In some instances 
  the correlation between annual cloud cover and annual DTR is remarkably strong, 
  suggesting a distinct relationship between cloud cover and DTR. This would be 
  expected since cloud dampens the diurnal cycle of radiation balance at the surface. 
  Anthropogenically-caused increases in tropospheric aerosol loadings have been 
  implicated in some of these cloud cover changes, while the aerosols themselves 
  can cause small changes in DTR without cloud changes (Hansen et al., 1998 and 
  <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
