<h1>B. The Observed Changes in the Climate System</h1>
Is the Earth's climate changing? The answer is unequivocally "Yes". 
A suite of observations supports this conclusion and provides insight about the 
rapidity of those changes. These data are also the bedrock upon which to construct 
the answer to the more difficult question: "Why is it changing?", which 
is addressed in later Sections.<br>
<p>This Section provides an updated summary of the observations that delineate 
  how the climate system has changed in the past. Many of the variables of the 
  climate system have been measured directly, i.e., the "instrumental record". 
  For example, widespread direct measurements of surface temperature began around 
  the middle of the 19th century. Near global observations of other surface "weather" 
  variables, such as precipitation and winds, have been made for about a hundred 
  years. Sea level measurements have been made for over 100 years in some places, 
  but the network of tide gauges with long records provides only limited global 
  coverage. Upper air observations have been made systematically only since the 
  late 1940s. There are also long records of surface oceanic observations made 
  from ships since the mid-19th century and by dedicated buoys since about the 
  late 1970s. Sub-surface oceanic temperature measurements with near global coverage 
  are now available from the late 1940s. Since the late 1970s, other data from 
  Earth-observation satellites have been used to provide a wide range of global 
  observations of various components of the climate system. In addition, a growing 
  set of palaeoclimatic data, e.g., from trees, corals, sediments, and ice, are 
  giving information about the Earth's climate of centuries and millennia 
  before the present.</p>
<p>This Section places particular emphasis on current knowledge of past changes 
  in key climate variables: temperature, precipitation and atmospheric moisture, 
  snow cover, extent of land and sea ice, sea level, patterns in atmospheric and 
  oceanic circulation, extreme weather and climate events, and overall features 
  of the climate variability. The concluding part of this Section compares the 
  observed trends in these various climate indicators to see if a collective picture 
  emerges. The degree of this internal consistency is a critical factor in assessing 
  the level of confidence in the current understanding of the climate system.</p>

<h2>B.1 Observed Changes in Temperature</h2>
<a name="temperatures"></a> 
<h3>Temperatures in the instrumental record for land and oceans</h3>
<i>The global average surface temperature has increased by 0.6 &plusmn; 0.2&deg;C<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#3","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>3</sup></small></a> 
since the late 19th century.</i> It is very likely that the 1990s was the warmest 
decade and 1998 the warmest year in the instrumental record since 1861 (see <a href="#figTechSum2">Figure 
2</a>). The main cause of the increased estimate of global warming of 0.15&deg;C 
since the SAR is related to the record warmth of the additional six years (1995 
to 2000) of data. A secondary reason is related to improved methods of estimating 
change. The current, slightly larger uncertainty range (&plusmn;0.2&deg;C, 95% 
confidence interval) is also more objectively based. Further, the scientific basis 
for confidence in the estimates of the increase in global temperature since the 
late 19th century has been strengthened since the SAR. This is due to the improvements 
derived from several new studies. These include an independent test of the corrections 
used for time-dependent biases in the sea surface temperature data and new analyses 
of the effect of urban "heat island" influences on global land-temperature 
trends. As indicated in <a href="#figTechSum2">Figure 2</a>, most of the increase 
in global temperature since the late 19th century has occurred in two distinct 
periods: 1910 to 1945 and since

1976. The rate of increase of temperature for both periods is about 0.15&deg;C/decade. 
Recent warming has been greater over land compared to oceans; the increase in 
sea surface temperature over the period 1950 to 1993 is about half that of the 
mean land-surface air temperature. The high global temperature associated with 
the 1997 to 1998 El Ni&ntilde;o event stands out as an extreme event, even taking 
into account the recent rate of warming.<br>
<p><i>The regional patterns of the warming that occurred in the early part of 
  the 20th century were different than those that occurred in the latter part.</i> 
  <a href="#figTechSum3">Figure 3</a> shows the regional patterns of the warming 
  that have occurred over the full 20th century, as well as for three component 
  time periods. The most recent period of warming (1976 to 1999) has been almost 
  global, but the largest increases in temperature have occurred over the mid- 
  and high latitudes of the continents in the Northern Hemisphere. Year-round 
  cooling is evident in the north-western North Atlantic and the central North 
  Pacific Oceans, but the North Atlantic cooling trend has recently reversed. 
  The recent regional patterns of temperature change have been shown to be related, 
  in part, to various phases of atmospheric-oceanic oscillations, such as the 
  North Atlantic-Arctic Oscillation and possibly the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. 
  Therefore, regional temperature trends over a few decades can be strongly influenced 
  by regional variability in the climate system and can depart appreciably from 
  a global average. The 1910 to 1945 warming was initially concentrated in the 
  North Atlantic. By contrast, the period 1946 to 1975 showed significant cooling 
  in the North Atlantic, as well as much of the Northern Hemisphere, and warming 
  in much of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p><i>New analyses indicate that global ocean heat content has increased significantly 
  since the late 1950s.</i> More than half of the increase in heat content has 
  occurred in the upper 300 m of the ocean, equivalent to a rate of temperature 
  increase in this layer of about 0.04&deg;C/decade.</p>
<p><i>New analyses of daily maximum and minimum land-surface temperatures for 
  1950 to 1993 continue to show that this measure of diurnal temperature range 
  is decreasing very widely, although not everywhere.</i> On average, minimum 
  temperatures are increasing at about twice the rate of maximum temperatures 
  (0.2 versus 0.1&deg;C/decade).</p>
<a name="above"></a> 
<h3>Temperatures above the surface layer from satellite and weather balloon records</h3>
<i>Surface, balloon and satellite temperature measurements show that the troposphere 
and Earth's surface have warmed and that the stratosphere has cooled. Over 
the shorter time period for which there have been both satellite and weather balloon 
data (since 1979), the balloon and satellite records show significantly less lower-tropospheric 
warming than observed at the surface.</i> Analyses of temperature trends since 
1958 for the lowest 8 km of the atmosphere and at the surface are in good agreement, 
as shown in <a href="#figTechSum4">Figure 4a</a>, with a warming of about 0.1&deg;C 
per decade. However, since the beginning of the satellite record in 1979, the 
temperature data from both satellites and weather balloons show a warming in the 
global middle-to-lower troposphere at a rate of approximately 0.05 &plusmn; 0.10&deg;C 
per decade. The global average surface temperature has increased significantly 
by 0.15 &plusmn; 0.05&deg;C/decade. The difference in the warming rates is statistically 
significant. By contrast, during the period 1958 to 1978, surface temperature 
trends were near zero, while trends for the lowest 8 km of the atmosphere were 
near 0.2&deg;C/decade. About half of the observed difference in warming since 
1979 is likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnts.htm#4","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'><small><sup>4</sup></small></a> 
to be due to the combination of the differences in spatial coverage of the surface 
and tropospheric observations and the physical effects of the sequence of volcanic 
eruptions and a substantial El Ni&ntilde;o (see Box 4 for a general description 
of ENSO) that occurred within this period. The remaining difference is very likely 
real and not an observing bias. It arises primarily due to differences in the 
rate of temperature change over the tropical and sub-tropical regions, which were 
faster in the lowest 8 km of the atmosphere before about 1979, but which have 
been slower since then. There are no significant differences in warming rates 
over mid-latitude continental regions in the Northern Hemisphere. In the upper 
troposphere, no significant global temperature trends have been detected since 
the early 1960s. In the stratosphere, as shown in <a href="#figTechSum4">Figure 
4b</a>, both satellites and balloons show substantial cooling, punctuated by sharp 
warming episodes of one to two years long that are due to volcanic eruptions.<br>
<a name="surface"></a> 
<h3>Surface temperatures during the pre-instrumental period from the proxy record</h3>
<p><i>It is likely that the rate and duration of the warming of the 20th century 
  is larger than any other time during the last 1,000 years. The 1990s are likely 
  to have been the warmest decade of the millennium in the Northern Hemisphere, 
  and 1998 is likely to have been the warmest year.</i> There has been a considerable 
  advance in understanding of temperature change that occurred over the last millennium, 
  especially from the synthesis of individual temperature reconstructions. This 
  new detailed temperature record for the Northern Hemisphere is shown in <a href="#figTechSum5">Figure 
  5</a>. The data show a relatively warm period associated with the 11th to 14th 
  centuries and a relatively cool period associated with the 15th to 19th centuries 
  in the Northern Hemisphere. However, evidence does not support these "Medieval 
  Warm Period" and "Little Ice Age" periods, respectively, as being globally synchronous. 
  As <a href="#figTechSum5">Figure 5</a> indicates, the rate and 
  duration of warming of the Northern Hemisphere in the 20th century appears to 
  have been unprecedented during the millennium, and it cannot simply be considered 
  as a recovery from the "Little Ice Age" of the 15th to 19th centuries. These 
  analyses are complemented by sensitivity analysis of the spatial representativeness 
  of available palaeoclimatic data, indicating that the warmth of the recent decade 
  is outside the 95% confidence interval of temperature uncertainty, even during 
  the warmest periods of the last millennium. Moreover, several different analyses 
  have now been completed, each suggesting that the Northern Hemisphere temperatures 
  of the past decade have been warmer than any other time in the past six to ten 
  centuries. This is the time-span over which temperatures with annual resolution 
  can be calculated using hemispheric-wide tree-ring, ice-cores, corals, and other 
  annually-resolved proxy data. Because less data are available, less is known 
  about annual averages prior to 1,000 years before the present and for conditions 
  prevailing in most of the Southern Hemisphere prior to 1861.<br>
  <i>It is likely that large rapid decadal temperature changes occurred during 
  the last glacial and its deglaciation (between about 100,000 and 10,000 years 
  ago), particularly in high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.</i> In a few 
  places during the deglaciation, local increases in temperature of 5 to 10&deg;C 
  are likely to have occurred over periods as short as a few decades. During the 
  last 10,000 years, there is emerging evidence of significant rapid regional 
  temperature changes, which are part of the natural variability of climate.</p>
