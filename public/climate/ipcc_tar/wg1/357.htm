      gases and aerosols. The future-forcing scenario is the IS92a scenario. See

<p><a name="fig921"></a>In the SAR, it was noted that the thermohaline circulation 
  (THC) weakens as CO<sub>2</sub> increases in the atmosphere in most coupled climate model 
  integrations. The weakening of the THC is found in both the Northern and Southern 
  Hemispheres. The amount of weakening varied from model to model, but in some 
  cases it was noted that the THC in the North Atlantic stopped completely (Manabe 
  and Stouffer, 1994; Hirst 1999). The weakening of the THC in the Atlantic Ocean 
  results in a reduction of the poleward heat transport that in turn leads to 
  a minimum in the surface warming in the northern North Atlantic Ocean and/or 
  in the circumpolar Ocean (see <a href="351.htm">Section 9.3.2</a>). The reduction 
  in the warming in the North Atlantic region touches the extreme north-eastern 
  part of North America and north-west Europe. The shutting off of the THC in 
  either hemisphere could have long-term implications for climate. However, even 
  in models where the THC weakens, there is still a warming over Europe. For example, 
  in all AOGCM integrations where the radiative forcing is increasing, the sign 
  of the temperature change over north-west Europe is positive (see <a href="351.htm#fig910">Figure 
  9.10</a>).</p>
<p><a href="#fig921">Figure 9.21</a> shows a comparison of the strength of the 
  THC through a number of transient experiments with various models and warming 
  scenarios over the 21st century. The initial (control state) absolute strength 
  of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC) varies by more than a factor 
  of 2 between the models, ranging from 10 to 30 Sv (1 Sv = 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). 
  The cause of this wide variation is unclear, but it must involve the sub-grid 
  parametrization schemes used for mixing in the oceans (Bryan, 1987) and differences 
  in the changes of the surface fluxes. The sensitivity of the THC to changes 
  in the radiative forcing is also quite different between the models. Generally 
  as the radiative forcing increases, most models show a reduction of THC. However, 
  some models show only a small weakening of the THC and one model (ECHAM4/OPYC; 
  Latif et al., 2000) has no weakening in response to increasing greenhouse gases, 
  as does the NCAR CSM as documented by Gent (2001). The exact reasons for the 
  difference in the THC responses are unknown, but the role of the surface fluxes 
  is certainly part of the reasons for the differences in the response (see below). 
</p>
<p>Stocker and Schmittner (1997), using an intermediate complexity model, found 
  that the North Atlantic THC shut-down when the rate of 1%/yr of CO<sub>2</sub> increase 
  was held fixed for approximately 100 years. This is in agreement with the earlier 
  AOGCM study of Manabe and Stouffer (1994), where the THC shut-down in an integration 
  where the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increased by 1%/yr to four times its initial value. 
  In integrations where the CO<sub>2</sub> stabilised at doubling, the THC did not shut-down 
  in either study (Stocker and Schmittner 1997; Manabe and Stouffer 1994). Furthermore, 
  in the Manabe and Stouffer (1994) AOGCM where the CO<sub>2</sub> is stabilised at four 
  times its normal value, the THC recovers to the control integration value around 
  model year 2300. A recent study (Stouffer and Manabe, 1999) found that the amount 
  of weakening of the THC by the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling is a function of the rate 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> increase and not the absolute increase in the radiative forcing. They 
  found the slower the rate of increase, the more the weakening of the THC by 
  the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling. </p>

<p><a name="fig922"></a>The evolution of the THC in response to future forcing 
  scenarios is a topic requiring further study. It should be noted in particular 
  that these climate model experiments do not currently include the possible effects 
  of significant freshwater input arising from changes in land ice sheets (Greenland 
  and Antarctic ice caps) and mountain glaciers, which might well lead to bigger 
  reductions in the THC. It is too early to say with confidence whether irreversible 
  shut-down of the THC is likely or not, or at what threshold it might occur. 
  Though no AOGCM to date has shown a shut-down of the THC by the year 2100, climate 
  changes over that period may increase the likelihood during subsequent centuries, 
  though this is scenario-dependent. The realism of the representation of oceanic 
  mechanisms involved in the THC changes also needs to be carefully evaluated 
  in the models. </p>
<p><i>Role of the surface fluxes</i><br>
  The role of heat, fresh water and momentum fluxes in weakening the North Atlantic 
  THC as a consequence of increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has been studied 
  in two different AOGCMs (ECHAM3/LSG, Mikolajewicz and Voss, 2000; and GFDL_R15_b, 
  Dixon et al., 1999). In both these studies (<a href="#fig922">Figure 9.22</a>), 
  two baseline integrations are performed; a control integration in which the 
  CO<sub>2</sub> is held fixed, and a perturbation integration in which the CO<sub>2</sub> is increasing. 
  The water fluxes from both of these integrations are archived and used as input 
  in two new integrations.</p>
<p>In the first integration, the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is held fixed and 
  the fresh water fluxes into the ocean are prescribed as those obtained from 
  the perturbation integration. In the second integration, the CO<sub>2</sub> increases as 
  in the perturbation integration and the water fluxes are prescribed to be the 
  fluxes from the control integration (see <a href="#tab95">Table 9.5</a>). In 
  this way, the relative roles of the fresh water and heat fluxes can be evaluated 
  (<a href="#fig922">Figure 9.22</a>).</p>
