<p> Following the apparent climate "shift'' in the tropical Pacific 
  around 1976 (Graham, 1994; Trenberth and Hurrell, 1994) (<a href="303.htm#fig79">Figure 
  7.9</a>), which is part of the recent tropical Pacific warming, the last two 
  decades are characterised by relatively more El Ni&ntilde;o variability, including 
  the two strongest El Ni&ntilde;o events (1982/83 and 1997/98) in the 130 years 
  of instrumental records and a long-lasting warm spell in the early 1990s (Trenberth 
  and Hoar, 1997; see Wunsch, 1999, and Trenberth and Hurrell, 1999, for a discussion 
  on statistical significance). The tropical Pacific warming may be linked to 
  anthropogenic forcing (Knutson and Manabe, 1998), but attribution is uncertain 
  in view of the strong natural variability observed (Latif et al., 1997; Zhang 
  et al., 1997b) and the inability of models to fully simulate ENSO realistically.</p>
<p> Whereas the above discussion has dealt with processes on multiple time-scales, 
  separation of the time-scales into inter-annual (periods less than a decade) 
  and inter-decadal (Zhang et al., 1997b) show quite similar patterns. More focused 
  equatorial signals occur on interannual time-scales, and are identifiable with 
  the equatorial dynamically active waves in the ocean, while the lower-frequency 
  variations, called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), have relatively a 
  somewhat larger expression in mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, but with an 
  "El Ni&ntilde;o-like" pattern. Because the patterns are highly spatially 
  correlated and thus not orthogonal, there is no unique projection onto them 
  at any one time and they should not be considered independently.</p>
<p> In the tropics, it has been difficult for models to simulate all of the important 
  processes correctly, and errors exist in the mean state of the tropical Pacific 
  and the variability (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>, <a href="330.htm#871">Section 
  8.7.1</a>). It is unlikely that it is possible to simulate the mean annual cycle 
  correctly without simulating realistic ENSO events, as ENSO alters the mean 
  state through rectification effects. For example, it is known that some regions 
  only receive rainfall during an El Ni&ntilde;o event. Hence it would be impossible 
  to simulate correct rainfall in these regions without also simulating El Ni&ntilde;o. 
  Moreover, ENSO events are phase-locked to the annual cycle and changes in the 
  mean state alter ENSO variability. In the Zebiak and Cane (1991) model the tropical 
  east Pacific SST is systematically cooler during the "weak ENSO" regime 
  than during the "strong ENSO" regime. Cloud radiative forcing feedbacks, 
  such as the interactions between stratus regimes and ocean temperature, are 
  poorly simulated, and the greenhouse effects of clouds versus their possible 
  brightening with climate change are very uncertain. </p>
<p> Model studies have shown that greenhouse gas forcing is likely to change the 
  statistics of ENSO variability, but the character of the change is model dependent. 
  A comprehensive simulation suggests that greenhouse warming may induce greater 
  ENSO activity marked by larger interannual variations relative to the warmer 
  mean state (Timmermann et al., 1999). More El Ni&ntilde;os would increase the 
  probability of certain weather regimes which favour COWL patterns associated 
  with increased hemispheric mean surface temperatures (Hurrell, 1996; Corti et 
  al., 1999). The positive feedbacks involved in ENSO imply that small errors 
  in simulating the relevant processes can be amplified. Yet increasing evidence 
  suggests that ENSO plays a fundamental role in global climate and its interannual 
  variability, and increased credibility in both regional and global climate projections 
  will be gained once realistic ENSOs and their changes are simulated. </p>
