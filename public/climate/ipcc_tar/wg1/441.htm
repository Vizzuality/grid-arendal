<p><i>Improved representation of anthropogenic forcing</i><br>
  Several studies since the SAR have included an explicit representation of greenhouse 
  gases (as opposed to an equivalent increase in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)). 
  Some have also included tropospheric ozone changes, an interactive sulphur cycle, 
  an explicit radiative treatment of the scattering of sulphate aerosols, and 
  improved estimates of the changes in stratospheric ozone. While detection of 
  the climate response to these other anthropogenic factors is often ambiguous, 
  detection of the influence of greenhouse gas increases on the surface temperature 
  changes over the past 50 years is robust.</p>
<p><i>Sensitivity to estimates of climate change signals</i><br>
  Since the SAR, more simulations with increases in greenhouse gases and some 
  representation of aerosol effects have become available. In some cases, ensembles 
  of simulations have been run to reduce noise in the estimates of the time-dependent 
  response. Some studies have evaluated seasonal variation of the response. Uncertainties 
  in the estimated climate change signals have made it difficult to attribute 
  the observed climate change to one specific combination of anthropogenic and 
  natural influences. Nevertheless, all studies since the SAR have found a significant 
  anthropogenic contribution is required to account for surface and tropospheric 
  trends over at least the last 30 years.</p>
<p><i>Qualitative consistencies between observed and modelled climate changes</i><br>
  There is a wide range of evidence of qualitative consistencies between observed 
  climate changes and model responses to anthropogenic forcing, including global 
  warming, increasing land-ocean temperature contrast, diminishing Arctic sea-ice 
  extent, glacial retreat and increases in precipitation in Northern Hemisphere 
  high latitudes. Some qualitative inconsistencies remain, including the fact 
  that models predict a faster rate of warming in the mid- to upper troposphere 
  which is not observed in either satellite or radiosonde tropospheric temperature 
  records. </p>
<p><i>A wider range of detection techniques</i><br>
  A major advance since the SAR is the increase in the range of techniques used, 
  and the evaluation of the degree to which the results are independent of the 
  assumptions made in applying those techniques. There have been studies using 
  pattern correlations, optimal detection studies using one or more fixed patterns 
  and time-varying patterns, and a number of other techniques. Evidence of a human 
  influence on climate is obtained using all these techniques.</p>
<p>Results are sensitive to the range of temporal and spatial scales that are 
  considered. Several decades of data are necessary to separate the forced response 
  from internal variability. Idealised studies have demonstrated that surface 
  temperature changes are detectable only on scales greater than 5,000 km. Studies 
  also show that the level of agreement found between simulations and observations 
  in pattern correlation studies is close to what one would expect in theory.</p>
<p>Attribution studies have applied multi-signal techniques to address whether 
  or not the magnitude of the observed response to a particular forcing agent 
  is consistent with the modelled response and separable from the influence of 
  other forcing agents. The inclusion of time-dependent signals has helped to 
  distinguish between natural and anthropogenic forcing agents. As more response 
  patterns are included, the problem of degeneracy (different combinations of 
  patterns yielding near identical fits to the observations) inevitably arises. 
  Nevertheless, even with the responses to all the major forcing factors included 
  in the analysis, a distinct greenhouse gas signal remains detectable. Overall, 
  the magnitude of the model-simulated temperature response to greenhouse gases 
  is found to be consistent with the observed greenhouse response on the scales 
  considered. However, there remain discrepancies between the modelled and observed 
  responses to other natural and anthropogenic factors, and estimates of signal 
  amplitudes are model-dependent. Most studies find that, over the last 50 years, 
  the estimated rate and magnitude of warming due to increasing concentrations 
  of greenhouse gases alone are comparable with, or larger than, the observed 
  warming. Furthermore, most model estimates that take into account both greenhouse 
  gases and sulphate aerosols are consistent with observations over this period.</p>
<p>The increase in the number of studies, the breadth of techniques, increased 
  rigour in the assessment of the role of anthropogenic forcing in climate, the 
  robustness of results to the assumptions made using those techniques, and consistency 
  of results lead to increased confidence in these results. Moreover, to be consistent 
  with the signal observed to date, the rate of anthropogenic warming is likely 
  to lie in the range 0.1 to 0.2&deg;C/decade over the first half of the 21st 
  century under the IS92a (IPCC, 1992) emission scenario.</p>
