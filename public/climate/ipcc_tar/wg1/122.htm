<h4>3.7.3.2 Concentration projections based on IS92a, for comparison with previous 
  studies</h4>
<p>Illustrative model runs (<a href="#fig311">Figure 3.11</a>) based on the IS92a 
  scenario (Leggett et al., 1992) are shown first so as to allow comparison with 
  earlier model results presented in the SAR and the SRRF (Schimel et al., 1995). 
  In the SRRF comparison of eighteen global carbon cycle models (Enting et al., 
  1994; Schimel et al., 1995) the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation response of the 
  land was calibrated to match the central estimate of the global carbon budget 
  for the 1980s, assuming a land-use source of 1.6 PgC/yr in the 1980s and attributing 
  the residual terrestrial sink to CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation. This intercomparison 
  yielded CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in 2100 of 668 to 734 ppm; results presented 
  in Schimel et al. (1996) (from the Bern model) gave 688 ppm. After recalibrating 
  to match a presumed land-use source of 1.1 PgC/yr, implying a weaker CO<sub>2</sub> 
  response, the 2100 CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was given as 712 ppm in the 
  SAR (Schimel et al., 1996). An IPCC Technical Paper (Wigley et al., 1997) evaluated 
  the sensitivity of IS92a results to this calibration procedure. Wigley et al., 
  (1997) found that a range of assumed values from 0.4 to 1.8 PgC/yr for the land-use 
  source during the 1980s gave rise to a range of 2100 CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  from 667 to 766 ppm.</p>

      <p><b>Figure 3.11:</b> Projected CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations resulting 
        from the IS92a emissions scenario. For a strict comparison with previous 
        work, IS92a-based projections were made with two fast carbon cycle models, 
        Bern-CC and ISAM (see <a href="#box37">Box 3.7</a>), based on CO<sub>2</sub> 
        changes only, and on CO<sub>2</sub> changes plus land and ocean climate 
        feedbacks. Panel (a) shows the CO<sub>2</sub> emisisons prescribed by 
        IS92a; the panels (b) and (c) show projected CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
        for the Bern-CC and ISAM models, respectively. Results obtained for the 
        SAR, using earlier versions of the same models, are also shown. The model 
        ranges for ISAM were obtained by tuning the model to approximate the range 
        of responses to CO<sub>2</sub> and climate shown by the models in <a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 
        3.10</a>, combined with a range of climate sensitivities from 1.5 to 4.5&deg;C 
        rise for a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>. This approach yields a lower bound 
        on uncertainties in the carbon cycle and climate. The model ranges for 
        Bern-CC were obtained by combining different bounding assumptions about 
        the behaviour of the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation effect, the response 
        of heterotrophic respiration to temperature and the turnover time of the 
        ocean, thus approaching an upper bound on uncertainties in the carbon 
        cycle. The effect of varying climate sensitivity from 1.5 to 4.5&deg;C 
        is shown separately for Bern-CC. Both models adopted a "reference 
        case" with mid-range behaviour of the carbon cycle and climate sensitivity 
        of 2.5&deg;C. </p>

<p>In contrast with the SAR, the results presented here are based on approximating 
  the behaviour of spatially resolved process-based models in which CO<sub>2</sub> and climate 
  responses are not constrained by prior assumptions about the global carbon budget. 
  The CO<sub>2</sub>-only response of both models' reference cases (<a href="#fig311">Figure 
  3.11</a>) leads to a 2100 CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 682 ppm (ISAM) or 651 ppm (Bern-CC). 
  These values are slightly lower than projected in the SAR - 715 ppm (ISAM; SAR 
  version) and 712 ppm (Bern Model; SAR version) - because current process-based 
  terrestrial models typically yield a stronger CO<sub>2</sub> response than was 
  assumed in the SAR. With climate feedbacks included, the 2100 CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration in the reference case becomes, by coincidence, effectively indistinguishable 
  from that given in the SAR: 723 ppm (ISAM) and 706 ppm (Bern-CC). The ranges 
  of 164 ppm or -12% / +11% (about the reference case) (ISAM) and 273 ppm or -10% 
  / +28% (Bern-CC) in the 2100 CO<sub>2</sub> concentration indicate that there 
  is significant uncertainty about the future CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations due 
  to any one pathway of changes in emissions. Separate calculations with the Bern-CC 
  model (<a href="#fig311">Figure 3.11</a>) show that the effect of changing climate 
  sensitivity alone is less important than the effect of varying assumptions in 
  the carbon cycle model's components. The effect of increasing climate sensitivity 
  to 4.5 &deg;C (increasing the climate feedback) is much larger than the effect 
  of reducing climate sensitivity to 1.5 &deg;C. The "low-CO<sub>2</sub>" 
  parametrization of Bern-CC yields CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations closer to the 
  reference case than the "high-CO<sub>2</sub>" parametrization, in 
  which the terrestrial sink is forced to approach zero during the first few decades 
  of the century due to the capping of the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation effect.</p>
<p>The reference simulations with ISAM yielded an implied average land-use source 
  during the 1980s of 0.9 PgC/yr. The range was 0.2 to 2.0 PgC/yr. Corresponding 
  values for Bern-CC were 0.6 PgC/yr and a range of 0.0 to 1.5 PgC/yr. These ranges 
  broadly overlap the range estimates of the 1980s land-use source given in <a href="097.htm#tab31">Table 
  3.1</a>. Present knowledge of the carbon budget is therefore not precise enough 
  to allow much narrowing of the uncertainty associated with future land and ocean 
  uptake as expressed in these projections. However, the lowest implied land-use 
  source values fall below the range given in <a href="097.htm#tab31">Table 3.1</a>.</p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 3.7: Fast, simplified models used in this assessment. 
        </b> </div>
      <p>The Bern-CC model comprises:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A box-diffusion type ocean carbon model, (HILDA version K(z); Siegenthaler 
          and Joos, 1992; Joos et al., 1996), already used in the SAR. In addition 
          to the SAR version, the effect of sea surface warming on carbonate chemistry 
          is included (Joos et al., 1999b).</li>
        <li>An impulse-response climate model (Hooss et al., 1999), which converts 
          radiative forcing into spatial patterns of changes in temperature, precipitation 
          and cloud cover on a global grid. The patterns of the climate anomalies 
          are derived from the first principal component of the climate response 
          shown by the full three-dimensional atmosphere-ocean GCM, ECHAM-3/LSG 
          (Voss and Mikolajewicz, 1999). Their magnitude is scaled according to 
          the prescribed climate sensitivity.</li>
        <li>The terrestrial carbon model LPJ, as described in Sitch et al. (2000) 
          and Cramer et al. (2001). LPJ is a process-based DGVM that falls in 
          the mid-range of CO<sub>2</sub> and climate responses as shown in Cramer et al. 
          (2001). It is used here at 3.75&deg; x 2.5&deg; resolution, as in Cramer 
          et al. (2001).</li>
        <li>A radiative forcing module. The radiative forcing of CO<sub>2</sub>, 
          the concentration increase of non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases and 
          their radiative forcing, direct forcing due to sulphate, black carbon 
          and organic aerosols, and indirect forcing due to sulphate aerosols 
          are projected using a variant of SAR models (Harvey et al., 1997; Fuglestvedt 
          and Berntsen, 1999) updated with information summarised in <a href="127.htm">Chapters 
          4</a>, <a href="160.htm">5</a> and <a href="212.htm">6</a>. The concentrations 
          of non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases, aerosol loadings, and radiative 
          forcings are consistent with those given in <a href="519.htm">Appendix 
          II</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sensitivities of projected CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations to model assumptions 
        were assessed as follows. Rh was assumed either to be independent of global 
        warming (Giardina and Ryan, 2000; Jarvis and Linder 2000), or to increase 
        with temperature according to Lloyd and Taylor (1994). CO<sub>2</sub> 
        fertilisation was either capped after year 2000 by keeping CO<sub>2</sub> 
        at the year 2000 value in the photosynthesis module, or increased asymptotically 
        following Haxeltine and Prentice (1996). (Although apparently unrealistic, 
        capping the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation in the model is designed to mimic 
        the possibility that other, transient factors such as land management 
        changes might be largely responsible for current terrestrial carbon uptake.) 
        Transport parameters of the ocean model (including gas exchange) were 
        scaled by a factor of 1.5 and 0.5. Average ocean uptake for the 1980s 
        is 2.0 PgC/yr in the reference case, 1.46 PgC/yr for the "slow ocean" 
        and 2.54 PgC/yr for the "fast ocean", roughly in accord with 
        the range of observational estimates (<a href="097.htm#tab31">Table 3.1</a>, 
        <a href="105.htm">Section 3.2.3.2</a>). A "low-CO<sub>2</sub>" 
        parametrization was obtained by combining the fast ocean and no response 
        of Rh to temperature. A "high-CO<sub>2</sub>" parametrization 
        was obtained by combining the slow ocean and capping CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation. 
        Climate sensitivity was set at 2.5 &deg;C for a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>. 
        Effects of varying climate sensitivity from 1.5&deg;C to 4.5&deg;C are 
        also shown for one case.</p>
      <p>The ISAM model was described by Jain et al. (1994) and used in the SAR 
        for CO<sub>2</sub>-only analyses, with a different set of model parameters 
        from those used here (Jain, 2000). The full configuration of ISAM comprises:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A globally aggregated upwelling-diffusion ocean model including the 
          effects of temperature on CO<sub>2</sub> solubility and carbonate chemistry 
          (Jain et al., 1995).</li>
        <li>An energy balance climate model of the type used in the IPCC 1990 
          assessment (Hoffert et al., 1980; Bretherton et al., 1990). In this 
          model, heat is transported as a tracer in the ocean and shares the same 
          transport parameters as DIC.</li>
        <li>A six-box globally aggregated terrestrial carbon model including empirical 
          parametrizations of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation and temperature effects 
          on productivity and respiration (Harvey, 1989; Kheshgi et al., 1996). 
        </li>
        <li>The radiative forcing of CO<sub>2</sub> projected using a SAR model 
          (Harvey et al., 1997) modified with information summarised in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
          6</a>. Radiative forcing from agents other than CO<sub>2</sub> are identical 
          to that used in the Bern-CC model.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to varying the climate sensitivity (1.5 to 4.5&deg;C), parameters 
        of the terrestrial and ocean components (strength of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation, 
        temperature response of NPP and heterotrophic respiration; ocean heat 
        and DIC transport) were adjusted to mimic the ranges of CO<sub>2</sub> 
        and climate responses as shown by existing process-based models (<a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 
        3.10</a>). A reference case was defined with climate sensitivity 2.5&deg;C, 
        ocean uptake corresponding to the mean of the ocean model results in <a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 
        3.10</a>, and terrestrial uptake corresponding to the mean of the responses 
        of the mid-range models LPJ, IBIS and SDGVM (<a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 
        3.10</a>). A "low CO<sub>2</sub>" parametrisation was chosen 
        with climate sensitivity 1.5&deg;C, and maximal CO<sub>2</sub> uptake 
        by oceans and land; and a "high-CO<sub>2</sub>" parametrization 
        with climate sensitivity 4.5&deg;C, and minimal CO<sub>2</sub> uptake 
        by oceans and land.</p>
