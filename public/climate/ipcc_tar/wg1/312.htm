<h3>8.2.3 Figures of Merit </h3>
<p>There have been many attempts to obtain a "figure of merit" for climate models. 
  Usually such quantification is only attempted for well-observed atmospheric 
  variables and range from calculation of simple root mean square errors (r.m.s.) 
  between a model variable and an observation, to more complex multi-variate calculations. 
  Among the most promising attempts at generating skill scores deemed more suitable 
  for climate models are: the normalised mean square error approach of Williamson 
  (1995) that follows on, in part, from Murphy (1988); and the categorisation 
  of models in terms of combination of the error in the time mean and the error 
  in temporal variability along the lines suggested by Wigley and Santer (1990) 
  (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3.1.1. of the SAR for an example). Other less widely 
  used non-dimensional measures have also been devised (e.g., Watterson, 1996). 
  Although a number of skill scoring methods have been devised and used for the 
  seasonal prediction problem (e.g., Potts et al., 1996; linear error in probability 
  space score - LEPS) these have not found general application in climate models. 
  Attempts to derive measures of the goodness of fit between model results and 
  data containing large uncertainties have been partially successful in the oceanographic 
  community for a limited number of variables (Frankignoul et al., 1989; Braconnot 
  and Frankignoul, 1993). Fuzzy logic techniques have been trialled by the palaeoclimatology 
  community (Guiot et al., 1999). It is important to remember that the types of 
  error measurement that have been discussed are restricted to relatively few 
  variables. It has proved elusive to derive a fully comprehensive multi-dimensional 
  "figure of merit" for climate models.</p>
<p>Since the SAR, Taylor (2000) has devised a very useful diagrammatic form (termed 
  a "Taylor diagram" - see <a href="317.htm">Section 8.5.1.2</a> for 
  description) for conveying information about the pattern similarity between 
  a model and observations. This same type of diagram can be used to illustrate 
  the relative accuracy amongst a number of model variables or different observational 
  data sets (see <a href="316.htm#851">Section 8.5.1</a>). One additional advantage 
  of the "Taylor diagram" is that there is no restriction placed on 
  the time or space domain considered.</p>
<p>While at times we use a figure of merit to intercompare models for some selected 
  variables, we usually apply more subjective assessments in our overall evaluations; 
  we do not believe it is objectively possible to state which model is "best 
  overall" for climate projection, since models differ amongst themselves 
  (and with available observations) in many different ways. Even if a model is 
  assessed as performing credibly when simulating the present climate, we cannot 
  be sure that the response of such a model to a perturbation remains credible. 
  Hence we also rely on evaluating models in their performance with individual 
  processes (see <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>) as well as past climates as 
  in <a href="324.htm">Section 8.5.5</a>.</p>
