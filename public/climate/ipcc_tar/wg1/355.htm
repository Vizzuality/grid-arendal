<p><i><a name="fig918"></a></i>A variety of feedback processes operate in the 
  climate system (<a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>) to determine the response to 
  changes in radiative forcing. The climate sensitivity (see <a href="344.htm#921">Section 
  9.2.1</a>) is a broad measure of this response. Ideally, a coupled AOGCM's 
  climate sensitivity would be obtained by integrating the model to a new climate 
  equilibrium after doubling the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the model atmosphere. 
  Since this requires a lengthy integration, climate sensitivities are usually 
  estimated with atmospheric GCMs coupled to mixed-layer upper ocean models, for 
  which the new equilibrium is obtained in decades rather than millennia. Equilibrium 
  climate sensitivities for models in current use are compared with the results 
  reported in the SAR. A related measure, the effective climate sensitivity, is 
  obtained from non-equilibrium transient climate change experiments.</p>
<p><i>Equilibrium climate sensitivity from AGCMs coupled to mixed-layer upper 
  ocean models<br>
  </i>The blue diamonds in <a href="#fig918">Figure 9.18</a> give the equilibrium 
  climate sensitivity and the associated percentage change in global mean precipitation 
  rate (sometimes termed the hydrological sensitivity) for seventeen equilibrium 
  mixed-layer model calculations documented in <a href="227.htm#tab63">Table 6.3</a> 
  of the SAR (Kattenberg et al., 1996). <a href="#tab94">Table 9.4</a> gives the 
  average sensitivity of the seventeen models as 3.8&deg;C for temperature and 
  8.4% for precipitation, with a standard deviation or "inter-model scatter" 
  of 0.78&deg;C and 2.9%, respectively. LeTreut and McAvaney (2000) provide a 
  recent compilation of climate sensitivities for mixed-layer models and this 
  information has been updated in <a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a> under 
  the column headed "equilibrium climate sensitivity". These results, 
  from fifteen models in active use, are represented by the red triangles in <a href="#fig918">Figure 
  9.18</a>. The associated statistics are given in <a href="#tab94">Table 9.4</a> 
  where the mean and standard deviation for temperature are 3.5 and 0.92&deg;C, 
  and for precipitation are 6.6 and 3.7%. </p>
<p>According to <a href="#tab94">Table 9.4</a> and <a href="#fig918">Figure 9.18</a>, 
  the average climate sensitivity, as estimated from AGCMs coupled to mixed-layer 
  ocean models, has decreased slightly from about 3.8 to 3.5&deg;C since the SAR. 
  The inter-model standard deviation has increased and the range has remained 
  essentially the same. The associated hydrological sensitivity has decreased 
  from 8.4 to 6.6% but the inter-model standard deviation has increased. As explained 
  in <a href="344.htm">Section 9.2</a>, these climate sensitivity values are not 
  altered by the lower value for the radiative forcing change for doubled CO<sub>2</sub> 
  discussed in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

<p>These results indicate slightly lower average values of sensitivity in models 
  in current use compared with the SAR. Although more recent models attempt to 
  incorporate improvements in our ability to simulate the climate system, these 
  mean results do not in themselves provide a clear indication that modelled climate 
  sensitivity has decreased. In particular, the inter-model scatter has increased 
  slightly, the range of results is not much changed, the differences are not 
  statistically significant, and the reasons for the modest decrease in average 
  sensitivity have not been identified. </p>

<p><i><a name="fig919"></a>Climate sensitivity from AGCMs coupled to full OGCMs</i><br>
  Because of the long time-scales associated with deep ocean equilibration, the 
  direct calculation of coupled model equilibrium temperature change for doubled 
  CO<sub>2</sub> requires an extended simulation and a considerable commitment 
  of computer resources. One such calculation has been performed (Stouffer and 
  Manabe, 1999, <a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a>); a 4,000 year simulation 
  with stabilisation at 2xCO<sub>2</sub>, and a 5,000 year simulation with stabilisation 
  at 4xCO<sub>2</sub>. <a href="#fig919">Figure 9.19</a> displays the temperature 
  for the first 500 years of these simulations (the red curves) together with 
  stabilisation results from other models discussed further below. The calculation 
  shows that: (1) some 15 to 20 centuries are required for the coupled model to 
  attain a new equilibrium after the forcing is stabilised, (2) for the 2xCO<sub>2</sub> 
  case, the temperature change ultimately increases to 4.5&deg;C for the GFDL_R15_a 
  model, which exceeds the 3.9&deg;C value obtained when a mixed-layer ocean is 
  used to estimate the climate sensitivity and, (3) the 4xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium 
  temperature change is very nearly twice that of the 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium 
  temperature change for this model. In this case the mixed-layer value of climate 
  sensitivity is resonably close to the full climate model value. The difference 
  between coupled model and mixed-layer sensitivities for other models is unknown. 
</p>
<p><i>Effective climate sensitivity</i><br>
  The term effective climate sensitivity (Murphy, 1995) as defined in <a href="344.htm#921">Section 
  9.2.1</a> is a measure of the strength of the feedbacks at a particular time 
  in a transient experiment. It is a function of climate state and may vary with 
  time. Watterson (2000) calculates the effective climate sensitivity from several 
  experiments with different versions of an AOGCM. The results show considerable 
  variability, particularly near the beginning of the integrations when the temperature 
  change is small. That study nevertheless concludes that the effective climate 
  sensitivity is approximately constant and close to the appropriate equilibrium 
  result. However, estimates of effective climate sensitivity obtained from the 
  HadCM2 model range from about 2.7&deg;C at the time of stabilisation at 2xCO<sub>2</sub> 
  to about 3.8&deg;C after 900 years (Raper et al., 2001a). Senior and Mitchell 
  (2000) implicate time-dependent cloud-feedbacks associated with the slower warming 
  of the Southern Ocean in that model as the cause for this variation in time. 
  The effective climate sensitivity of this climate model is initially considerably 
  smaller than the equilibrium sensitivity obtained with a mixed-layer ocean. 
  As the coupled model integration approaches a new equilibrium, the effective 
  climate sensitivity increases and appears to be approaching the equilibrium 
  climate sensitivity. </p>
<p>If effective climate sensitivity varies with climate state, estimates of climate 
  sensitivity made from a transient simulation may not reflect the ultimate warming 
  the system will undergo. The use of a constant climate sensitivity in simple 
  models will lead to inconsistencies which depend on the value of sensitivity 
  chosen. This feature deserves further study. </p>
<p><i>Summary</i><br>
  The climate sensitivity is a basic measure of the response of the climate system 
  to a change in forcing. It may be measured in several ways as discussed above. 
  The equilibrium climate sensitivity, that is, the range of the surface air temperature 
  response to a doubling of the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, was 
  estimated to be between 1.5 and 4.5&deg;C in the SAR (Kattenberg et al., 1996). 
  That range still encompasses the estimates from the current models in active 
  use.</p>
