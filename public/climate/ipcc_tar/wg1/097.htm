<h1>3.1 Introduction </h1>
<p>The concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere has risen from close 
  to 280 parts per million (ppm) in 1800, at first slowly and then progressively 
  faster to a value of 367 ppm in 1999, echoing the increasing pace of global 
  agricultural and industrial development. This is known from numerous, well-replicated 
  measurements of the composition of air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice. Atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have been measured directly with high precision 
  since 1957; these measurements agree with ice-core measurements, and show a 
  continuation of the increasing trend up to the present.<br>
  <br>
  Several additional lines of evidence confirm that the recent and continuing 
  increase of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> content is caused by anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions - most importantly fossil fuel burning. First, atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> 
  is declining at a rate comparable with fossil fuel emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  (combustion consumes O<sub>2</sub>). Second, the characteristic isotopic signatures 
  of fossil fuel (its lack of <sup>14</sup>C, and depleted content of <sup>13</sup>C) 
  leave their mark in the atmosphere. Third, the increase in observed CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration has been faster in the northern hemisphere, where most fossil 
  fuel burning occurs. <br>
  <br>
  Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, increasing only at about half the rate 
  of fossil fuel emissions; the rest of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted either dissolves 
  in sea water and mixes into the deep ocean, or is taken up by terrestrial ecosystems. 
  Uptake by terrestrial ecosystems is due to an excess of primary production (photosynthesis) 
  over respiration and other oxidative processes (decomposition or combustion 
  of organic material). Terrestrial systems are also an anthropogenic source of 
  CO<sub>2</sub> when land-use changes (particularly deforestation) lead to loss 
  of carbon from plants and soils. Nonetheless, the global balance in terrestrial 
  systems is currently a net uptake of CO<sub>2</sub>. <br>
  <br>
  The part of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> that is taken up by the ocean and the 
  part that is taken up by the land can be calculated from the changes in atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> content because terrestrial processes of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  exchange involve exchange of oxygen whereas dissolution in the ocean does not. 
  Global carbon budgets based on CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> measurements 
  for the 1980s and 1990s are shown in <a href="#tab31">Table 3.1</a>. The human 
  influence on the fluxes of carbon among the three "reservoirs" (atmosphere, 
  ocean, and terrestrial biosphere) represent a small but significant perturbation 
  of a huge global cycle (<a href="#fig31">Figure 3.1</a>).</p>

      <p><b>Figure 3.1:</b> The global carbon cycle: storages (PgC) and fluxes 
        (PgC/yr) estimated for the 1980s. (a) Main components of the natural cycle. 
        The thick arrows denote the most important fluxes from the point of view 
        of the contemporary CO<sub>2</sub> balance of the atmosphere: gross primary 
        production and respiration by the land biosphere, and physical air-sea 
        exchange. These fluxes are approximately balanced each year, but imbalances 
        can affect atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration significantly over 
        years to centuries. The thin arrows denote additional natural fluxes (dashed 
        lines for fluxes of carbon as CaCO3), which are important on longer time-scales. 
        The flux of 0.4 PgC/yr from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> via plants to inert 
        soil carbon is approximately balanced on a time-scale of several millenia 
        by export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rivers (Schlesinger, 1990). 
        A further 0.4 PgC/yr flux of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is derived 
        from the weathering of CaCO3, which takes up CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere 
        in a 1:1 ratio. These fluxes of DOC and DIC together comprise the river 
        transport of 0.8 PgC/yr. In the ocean, the DOC from rivers is respired 
        and released to the atmosphere, while CaCO3 production by marine organisms 
        results in half of the DIC from rivers being returned to the atmosphere 
        and half being buried in deep-sea sediments - which are the precursor 
        of carbonate rocks. Also shown are processes with even longer time-scales: 
        burial of organic matter as fossil organic carbon (including fossil fuels), 
        and outgassing of CO<sub>2</sub> through tectonic processes (vulcanism). 
        Emissions due to vulcanism are estimated as 0.02 to 0.05 PgC/yr (Williams 
        et al., 1992; Bickle, 1994). (b) The human perturbation (data from Table 
        3.1). Fossil fuel burning and land-use change are the main anthropogenic 
        processes that release CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. Only a part of 
        this CO<sub>2</sub> stays in the atmosphere; the rest is taken up by the 
        land (plants and soil) or by the ocean. These uptake components represent 
        imbalances in the large natural two-way fluxes between atmosphere and 
        ocean and between atmosphere and land. (c) Carbon cycling in the ocean. 
        CO<sub>2</sub> that dissolves in the ocean is found in three main forms 
        (CO<sub>2</sub>, CO32-, HCO3-, the sum of which is DIC). DIC is transported 
        in the ocean by physical and biological processes. Gross primary production 
        (GPP) is the total amount of organic carbon produced by photosynthesis 
        (estimate from Bender et al., 1994); net primary production (NPP) is what 
        is what remains after autotrophic respiration, i.e., respiration by photosynthetic 
        organisms (estimate from Falkowski et al., 1998). Sinking of DOC and particulate 
        organic matter (POC) of biological origin results in a downward flux known 
        as export production (estimate from Schlitzer, 2000). This organic matter 
        is tranported and respired by non-photosynthetic organisms (heterotrophic 
        respiration) and ultimately upwelled and returned to the atmosphere. Only 
        a tiny fraction is buried in deep-sea sediments. Export of CaCO3 to the 
        deep ocean is a smaller flux than total export production (0.4 PgC/yr) 
        but about half of this carbon is buried as CaCO3 in sediments; the other 
        half is dissolved at depth, and joins the pool of DIC (Milliman, 1993). 
        Also shown are approximate fluxes for the shorter-term burial of organic 
        carbon and CaCO3 in coastal sediments and the re-dissolution of a part 
        of the buried CaCO3 from these sediments. (d) Carbon cycling on land. 
        By contrast with the ocean, most carbon cycling through the land takes 
        place locally within ecosystems. About half of GPP is respired by plants. 
        The remainer (NPP) is approximately balanced by heterotrophic respiration 
        with a smaller component of direct oxidation in fires (combustion). Through 
        senescence of plant tissues, most of NPP joins the detritus pool; some 
        detritus decomposes (i.e., is respired and returned to the atmosphere 
        as CO<sub>2</sub>) quickly while some is converted to modified soil carbon, 
        which decomposes more slowly. The small fraction of modified soil carbon 
        that is further converted to compounds resistant to decomposition, and 
        the small amount of black carbon produced in fires, constitute the "inert" 
        carbon pool. It is likely that biological processes also consume much 
        of the "inert" carbon as well but little is currently known 
        about these processes. Estimates for soil carbon amounts are from Batjes 
        (1996) and partitioning from Schimel et al. (1994) and Falloon et al. 
        (1998). The estimate for the combustion flux is from Scholes and Andreae 
        (2000). &#145;t' denotes the turnover time for different components 
        of soil organic matter.</p>

<p>This chapter summarises current knowledge of the global carbon cycle, with 
  special reference to the fate of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> and the factors 
  that influence the uptake or release of CO<sub>2</sub> by the oceans and land. 
  These factors include atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration itself, the naturally 
  variable climate, likely climate changes caused by increasing CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and other greenhouse gases, changes in ocean circulation and biology, fertilising 
  effects of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen deposition, and direct human 
  actions such as land conversion (from native vegetation to agriculture and vice 
  versa), fire suppression and land management for carbon storage as provided 
  for by the Kyoto Protocol (IPCC, 2000a). Any changes in the function of either 
  the terrestrial biosphere or the ocean - whether intended or not - could potentially 
  have significant effects, manifested within years to decades, on the fraction 
  of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> that stays in the atmosphere. This perspective 
  has driven a great deal of research during the years since the IPCC WGI Second 
  Assessment report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) (Schimel et al., 1996; Melillo 
  et al., 1996; Denman et al., 1996). Some major areas where advances have been 
  made since the SAR are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Observational research (atmospheric, marine and terrestrial) aimed at a 
    better quantification of carbon fluxes on local, regional and global scales. 
    For example, improved precision and repeatability in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
    and stable isotope measurements; the development of highly precise methods 
    to measure changes in atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> concentrations; local terrestrial 
    CO<sub>2</sub> flux measurements from towers, which are now being performed 
    continuously in many terrestrial ecosystems; satellite observations of global 
    land cover and change; and enhanced monitoring of geographical, seasonal and 
    interannual variations of biogeochemical parameters in the sea, including 
    measurements of the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>) 
    in surface waters.</li>
  <li>Experimental manipulations, for example: laboratory and greenhouse experiments 
    with raised and lowered CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations; field experiments on 
    ecosystems using free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) and open-top chamber 
    studies of raised CO<sub>2</sub> effects, studies of soil warming and nutrient 
    enrichment effects; and in situ fertilisation experiments on marine ecosystems 
    and associated <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> measurements.</li>
  <li>Theory and modelling, especially applications of atmospheric transport models 
    to link atmospheric observations to surface fluxes (inverse modelling); the 
    development of process-based models of terrestrial and marine carbon cycling 
    and programmes to compare and test these models against observations; and 
    the use of such models to project climate feedbacks on the uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> 
    by the oceans and land.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of this research, there is now a more firmly based knowledge of 
  several central features of the carbon cycle. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Time series of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> 
    measurements have made it possible to observationally constrain the partitioning 
    of CO<sub>2</sub> between terrestrial and oceanic uptake and to confirm earlier 
    budgets, which were partly based on model results.</li>
  <li>In situ experiments have explored the nature and extent of CO<sub>2</sub> 
    responses in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems (including forests), and 
    have confirmed the existence of iron limitations on marine productivity.</li>
  <li>Process-based models of terrestrial and marine biogeochemical processes 
    have been used to represent a complex array of feedbacks in the carbon cycle, 
    allowing the net effects of these processes to be estimated for the recent 
    past and for future scenarios.</li>
