<h2>2.2 How Much is the World Warming?</h2>
<h3><a name="221"></a>2.2.1 Background</h3>
<p>The SAR concluded that, on a global average, land-surface air and sea surface 
  temperature rose by between 0.3&deg;C and 0.6&deg;C between the late 19th century 
  and 1994. In this section, the recent warming is re-examined, using updated 
  data. We include recent analyses of the diurnal asymmetry of the warming and 
  its geographical structure. Conventional temperature observations are supplemented 
  by indirect evidence and by satellite-based data. For the first time, we make 
  objective estimates of uncertainties in the surface temperature data, though 
  these are preliminary. We also assess recent work in compiling hemispheric and 
  global temperature records from palaeoclimatic data, especially for the most 
  recent millennium. </p>

<h4><a name="2221"></a>2.2.2.1 Land-surface air temperature</h4>
<p>The SAR reviewed the three databases of land-surface air temperature due to 
  Jones (1994), Hansen and Lebedeff (1988) and Vinnikov et al. (1990). The first 
  and second databases have been updated by Jones et al. (2001) and Hansen et 
  al. (1999), respectively, and a further analysis has become available (Peterson 
  and Vose, 1997; Peterson et al., 1998a, 1999). The last paper also separates 
  rural temperature stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) 
  (Peterson and Vose, 1997) from the full set of stations which, in common with 
  the other three analyses, have been screened for urbanisation effects. While 
  there is little difference in the long-term (1880 to 1998) rural (0.70&deg;C/century) 
  and full set of station temperature trends (actually less at 0.65&deg;C/century), 
  more recent data (1951 to 1989), as cited in Peterson et al. (1999), do suggest 
  a slight divergence in the rural (0.80&deg;C/century) and full set of station 
  trends (0.92&deg;C/century). However, neither pair of differences is statistically 
  significant. In addition, while not reported in Peterson et al., the 1951 to 
  1989 trend for urban stations alone was 0.10&deg;C/decade. We conclude that 
  estimates of long-term (1880 to 1998) global land-surface air temperature variations 
  and trends are relatively little affected by whether the station distribution 
  typically used by the four global analyses is used, or whether a special effort 
  is made to concentrate on rural stations using elaborate criteria to identify 
  them. Part of the reason for this lack of sensitivity is that the average trends 
  in available worldwide urban stations for 1951 to 1989 are not greatly more 
  than those for all land stations (0.09&deg;C/decade). The differences in trend 
  between rural and all stations are also virtually unaffected by elimination 
  of areas of largest temperature change, like Siberia, because such areas are 
  well represented in both sets of stations.</p>
<p>These results confirm the conclusions of Jones et al. (1990) and Easterling 
  et al. (1997) that urban effects on 20th century globally and hemispherically 
  averaged land air temperature time-series do not exceed about 0.05&deg;C over 
  the period 1900 to 1990 (assumed here to represent one standard error in the 
  assessed non-urban trends). However, greater urbanisation influences in future 
  cannot be discounted. Note that changes in borehole temperatures (<a href="067.htm#232">Section 
  2.3.2</a>), the recession of the glaciers (<a href="064.htm#2254">Section 2.2.5.4</a>), 
  and changes in marine temperature (<a href="055.htm#2222">Section 2.2.2.2</a>), 
  which are not subject to urbanisation, agree well with the instrumental estimates 
  of surface warming over the last century. Reviews of the homogeneity and construction 
  of current surface air temperature databases appear in Peterson et al. (1998b) 
  and Jones et al. (1999a). The latter shows that global temperature anomalies 
  can be converted into absolute temperature values with only a small extra uncertainty.</p>
<p><a href="052.htm#fig21">Figure 2.1a</a> shows the Jones et al. (2001) CRU (Climatic 
  Research Unit) annual averages, together with an approximately decadally smoothed 
  curve, to highlight decadal and longer changes. This is compared with smoothed 
  curves from the other three analyses in <a href="052.htm#fig21">Figure 2.1b</a>. 
  We do not show standard errors for the CRU land data using the Jones et al. 
  (1997b) method as tests suggest that these may not be reliable for land data 
  on its own. Instead we use an optimum averaging method (Folland et al., 2001) 
  where the calculated uncertainties are centred on the simple CRU average. We 
  have added an estimate of the additional, independent, uncertainty (twice the 
  standard error) due to urbanisation increasing from zero in 1900 to 0.12&deg;C 
  in 2000. (The Jones et al. (1990) estimates can be interpreted as one standard 
  error equal to 10% of the global warming to that time of about 0.05&deg;C, see also 
  <a href="#box21">Box 2.1</a> on urbanisation.) Note that the warming 
  substantially exceeds the calculated uncertainties. (We have not included the 
  possible refinement of assuming urbanisation uncertainties to apply to the cold 
  side of the trend line only, which would reduce the total uncertainty range 
  in <a href="052.htm#fig21">Figure 2.1</a>.)<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 2.1: Urban Heat Island and the Observed Increases 
        in Land Air Temperature. </b> </div>
      <p>There are two primary reasons why urban heat islands have been suspected 
        as being partially responsible for the observed increases in land air 
        temperatures over the last few decades. The first is related to the observed 
        decrease in the diurnal temperature range and the second is related to 
        a lower rate of warming observed over the past twenty years in the lower 
        troposphere compared with the surface.</p>
      <p>Since the 1950s both daily maximum and minimum temperatures are available 
        over more than 50% of the global land area. These data indicate that on 
        average the mean minimum temperature has increased at nearly twice the 
        rate of the maximum temperature, reducing the daily temperature range 
        by about 0.4&deg;C over these areas. This has raised questions related 
        to whether the growth of urban heat islands may be responsible for a substantial 
        portion of the observed mean temperature increase, because it is well-known 
        that compared to non-urban areas urban heat islands raise night-time temperatures 
        more than daytime temperatures. Nonetheless, the relatively strong correlation 
        between observed decreases in the daily temperature range with increases 
        of both precipitation (leading to more moist surface conditions) and total 
        cloud amount support the notion that the reduction in diurnal temperature 
        range is in response to these physical changes. </p>
      <p>Since 1979 satellite observations and weather balloons (which generally 
        agree well) show substantially less warming of the global lower troposphere 
        (around 2 km) than surface temperatures (0.03 and 0.04&deg;C/decade, respectively, 
        compared to 0.16&deg;C/decade at the surface). However, over the Northern 
        Hemisphere land areas where urban heat islands are most apparent, both 
        the trends of lower-tropospheric temperature and surface air temperature 
        show no significant differences. In fact, the lower-tropospheric temperatures 
        warm at a slightly greater rate over North America (about 0.28&deg;C/decade 
        using satellite data) than do the surface temperatures (0.27&deg;C/decade), 
        although again the difference is not statistically significant. In the 
        global average, the trend differences arise largely from the tropical 
        and sub-tropical oceans. In many such regions, the near-surface marine 
        air temperatures tend to be cool and dense compared with conditions aloft, 
        allowing for the lapse rate with height, disconnecting near-surface (up 
        to about 1 km) conditions from higher layers in the atmosphere. Thus the 
        surface marine layer and the troposphere above can have differing variations 
        and trends. </p>
      <p>Clearly, the urban heat island effect is a real climate change in urban 
        areas, but is not representative of larger areas. Extensive tests have 
        shown that the urban heat island effects are no more than about 0.05&deg;C 
        up to 1990 in the global temperature records used in this chapter to depict 
        climate change. Thus we have assumed an uncertainty of zero in global 
        land-surface air temperature in 1900 due to urbanisation, linearly increasing 
        to 0.06&deg;C (two standard deviations 0.12&deg;C) in 2000.</p>
