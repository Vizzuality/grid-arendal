<h3>12.2.4 Some Important Statistical Considerations </h3>
<p>Most recent studies (Hegerl et al., 1996, 1997, 2000, 2001; North and Stevens, 
  1998; Allen and Tett, 1999; Tett et al., 1999, 2000; Berliner et al., 2000; 
  North and Wu, 2001; Stott et al., 2001) have used a regression approach in which 
  it is assumed that observations can be represented as a linear combination of 
  candidate signals plus noise (see <a href="468.htm">Appendices 12.1</a> and 
  <a href="469.htm">12.2</a>). Other approaches, such as pattern correlation (Santer 
  et al., 1995, 1996a; see also <a href="470.htm">Appendix 12.3</a>), complement 
  the regression approach, being particularly valuable in cases where model-simulated 
  response patterns are particularly uncertain. In all cases, the signal patterns 
  are obtained from climate models. In the regression approach, the unknown signal 
  amplitudes are estimated from observations. The uncertainty of these estimates 
  that is caused by natural variability in the observations is expressed with 
  confidence intervals. Detection of an individual signal is achieved when the 
  confidence interval for its amplitude does not include zero. Overall detection 
  (that some climate change has taken place) is achieved when the joint confidence 
  interval on the signals considered does not encompass the origin.</p>
<p><i>Attribution and consistency</i><br>
  Detecting that some climate change has taken place does not immediately imply 
  that we know the cause of the detected change. The practical approach to attribution 
  that has been taken by climatologists includes a demand for consistency between 
  the signal amplitudes projected by climate models and estimated from observations 
  (Hasselmann, 1997). Consequently, several studies, including Hegerl et al. (1997, 
  2000) and Tett et al. (1999, 2000) have performed an "attribution" 
  consistency test that is designed to detect inconsistency between observed and 
  model projected signal amplitudes. This test is a useful adjunct to detection 
  because it provides an objective means of identifying model-simulated signal 
  amplitudes that are significantly different from those estimated from observations. 
  However, the test does not give the final word on attribution because it is 
  designed to identify evidence of inconsistency rather than evidence for consistency 
  between modelled and observed estimates of signal strength. A further refinement 
  (e.g., Stott et al., 2001) is to consider the full range of signals believed, 
  on physical grounds, to be likely to have had a significant impact on recent 
  climate change and to identify those subsets of these signals that are consistent 
  with recent observations. If all these subsets contain an anthropogenic component, 
  for example, then at least part of the observed change can be attributed to 
  anthropogenic influence. Levine and Berliner (1999) point out that a test that 
  searches for consistency is available (Brown et al., 1995), but it has not yet 
  been used in attribution studies. Bayesian statisticians approach the problem 
  more directly by estimating the posterior probability that the signal amplitudes 
  projected by climate models are close to those in the observed climate. Berliner 
  et al. (2000) provides a demonstration.</p>
<p><i>The use of climate models to estimate natural internal variability</i><br>
  Climate models play a critical role in these studies because they provide estimates 
  of natural internal variability as well as the signals. In most studies an estimate 
  of natural internal variability is needed to optimise the search for the signal 
  and this is usually obtained from a long control simulation. In addition, a 
  separate estimate of natural variability is required to determine the uncertainty 
  of the amplitude estimates. Unfortunately, the short instrumental record gives 
  only uncertain estimates of variability on the 30 to 50 year time-scales that 
  are important for detection and attribution and palaeo-data presently lacks 
  the necessary spatial coverage (see <a href="445.htm#1222">Section 12.2.2</a>). 
  Thus a second control integration is generally used to estimate the uncertainty 
  of the amplitude estimates that arises from natural climate variability (e.g., 
  Hegerl et al., 1996; Tett et al., 1999). </p>
<p><i>Temporal and spatial scales used in detection studies</i><br>
  While a growing number of long control simulations are becoming available, there 
  remain limitations on the spatial scales that can be included in global scale 
  detection and attribution studies. Present day control simulations, which range 
  from 300 to about 2,000 years in length, are not long enough to simultaneously 
  estimate internal variability on the 30 to 50 year time-scale over a broad range 
  of spatial scales. Consequently, detection and attribution studies are conducted 
  in a reduced space that includes only large spatial scales. This space is selected 
  so that it represents the signals well and allows reliable estimation of internal 
  variability on the scales retained (see <a href="471.htm">Appendix 12.4</a>). 
  Recently, the scale selection process has been augmented with a statistical 
  procedure that checks for consistency between model simulated and observed variability 
  on the scales that are retained (Allen and Tett, 1999).</p>
<p><i>Fixed and temporally-varying response patterns</i><br>
  Detection and attribution studies performed up to the SAR used fixed signal 
  patterns that did not evolve with time. These studies were hampered because 
  the mean large-scale response of climate to different types of anomalous forcing 
  tends to be similar (e.g., Mitchell et al., 1995a; Reader and Boer, 1998; see 
  also <a href="447.htm#fig123">Figure 12.3</a>). Recent studies have been able 
  to distinguish more clearly between signals from anthropogenic and other sources 
  by including information from climate models about their temporal evolution. 
  Tett et al. (1999, 2000) and Stott et al. (2001) in related studies have used 
  a space-time approach in which the signal pattern evolves on the decadal time-scale 
  over a 50-year period. North and Wu (2001) also use a space-time approach. North 
  and Stevens (1998) used a related space-frequency approach (see <a href="469.htm">Appendix 
  12.2</a>).</p>
<p><i>Allowance for noise in signal patterns</i><br>
  Most studies have assumed that signal patterns are noise free. This is a reasonable 
  assumption for fixed pattern studies (see <a href="445.htm">Appendix 12.2</a>) 
  but space-time estimates of the 20th century climate change obtained from small 
  ensembles of forced climate simulations are contaminated by the model's 
  internal variability. Allen and Tett (1999) point out that noise in the signal 
  patterns will tend to make the standard detection algorithm (e.g., Hasselmann, 
  1993, 1997) somewhat conservative. Methods for accommodating this source of 
  noise have been available for more than a century (Adcock, 1878; see also Ripley 
  and Thompson, 1987). Allen and Stott (2000) recently applied such a method and 
  found that, while the question of which signals could be detected was generally 
  unaffected, the estimated amplitude of individual signals was sensitive to this 
  modification of the procedure. Another source of uncertainty concerns differences 
  in signal patterns between different models. Recent studies (Allen et al., 2000a,b; 
  Barnett et al., 2000; Hegerl et al., 2000) consider the sensitivity of detection 
  and attribution results to these differences. </p>
