<h2>6.8 The Indirect Radiative Forcing of Tropospheric Aerosols</h2>
<h3><a name="681"></a>6.8.1 Introduction </h3>
<p>Aerosols serve as cloud condensation and ice nuclei, thereby modifying the 
  microphysics, the radiative properties, and the lifetime of clouds. The physics 
  and chemistry of the indirect effect of aerosols is discussed in detail in <a href="160.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>. Only aspects directly relevant to quantifying the indirect radiative 
  forcing by aerosols are presented here. The aerosol indirect effect is usually 
  split into two effects: the first indirect effect, whereby an increase in aerosols 
  causes an increase in droplet concentration and a decrease in droplet size for 
  fixed liquid water content (Twomey, 1974), and the second indirect effect, whereby 
  the reduction in cloud droplet size affects the precipitation efficiency, tending 
  to increase the liquid water content, the cloud lifetime (Albrecht, 1989), and 
  the cloud thickness (Pincus and Baker, 1994). Until recently, the first indirect 
  effect has received much more attention than the second. IPCC (1994) and the 
  SAR only considered the first indirect effect. Shine et al. (1996) retained 
  a range of radiative forcing from 0 to -1.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with no best estimate, 
  although a value of -0.8 Wm<sup>-2</sup> was used for the year 1990 in the IS92a 
  scenario (Kattenberg et al., 1996). Here we review and discuss the various estimates 
  for the globally averaged aerosol indirect forcing available in the literature. 
  Because of the inherent complexity of the aerosol indirect effect, GCM studies 
  dealing with its quantification necessarily include an important level of simplification. 
  While this represents a legitimate approach, it should be clear that the GCM 
  estimates of the aerosol indirect effect are very uncertain. <a href="#682">Section 
  6.8.2</a> investigates the indirect radiative forcing due to sulphate aerosols, 
  on which most efforts have concentrated, while other aerosol types are treated 
  in <a href="240.htm">Section 6.8.3</a>. <a href="241.htm#684">Section 6.8.4</a> 
  is devoted to alternative approaches, while <a href="242.htm#686">Section 6.8.6</a> 
  describes the aerosol indirect effects on ice clouds.</p>
<h3><a name="682"></a>6.8.2 Indirect Radiative Forcing by Sulphate Aerosols</h3>
<h4><a name="6821"></a>6.8.2.1 Estimates of the first indirect effect </h4>
<p>The studies reported in <a href="#tab66">Table 6.6</a> use different GCMs and 
  methods for computing the droplet number concentration (i.e., empirical relationships 
  between the sulphate mass and the cloud droplet number concentration, empirical 
  relationships between the sulphate aerosol number concentration and the cloud 
  droplet number concentration, or parametrization of cloud nucleation processes). 
  The forcing estimates for the first indirect effect from sulphate aerosols range 
  from -0.3 to -1.8 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, which is close to the range of 0 to -1.5 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup> given in the SAR when only a few estimates were available.</p>

<p>There is a tendency for more and more studies to use interactive (on-line) 
  rather than prescribed (monthly or annual mean) sulphate concentrations. Feichter 
  et al. (1997) pointed out that the first indirect effect calculated from monthly 
  mean sulphate concentrations is 20% larger than calculated from interactive 
  sulphate concentrations. Jones et al. (1999) found that the total indirect effect 
  was overestimated by about 60% when they used seasonal or annual mean sulphate 
  concentrations.</p>
<p>The various GCM studies show some disagreement on the spatial distribution 
  of the forcing, an example of which is shown in <a href="253.htm#fig67">Figure 
  6.7h</a>. The Northern to Southern Hemisphere ratio varies from 1.4 to 4 depending 
  on the models. It is generally smaller than the Northern to Southern Hemisphere 
  ratio of anthropogenic sulphate aerosol concentrations because of the higher 
  susceptibility of the clouds in the Southern Hemisphere (Platnick and Twomey, 
  1994; Taylor and McHaffie, 1994). The ocean to land ratio depends very much 
  on the method used to relate the concentration of sulphate mass to the cloud 
  droplet number concentration and on the natural background aerosol concentrations. 
  It was generally found to be smaller than unity (Boucher and Lohmann, 1995; 
  Jones and Slingo, 1997; Kiehl et al., 2000). Larger ratios, such as 1.6 (Chuang 
  et al., 1997) and 5 (Jones and Slingo, 1997), are reported in some of the sensitivity 
  experiments. Using a detailed inventory of ship sulphur emissions and a simple 
  calculation of the aerosol indirect effect, Capaldo et al. (1999) suggested 
  that a significant fraction of the effect over the oceans (-0.11 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, 
  averaged globally) could be due to ship-emitted particulate matter (sulphate 
  plus organic material). So far this source of aerosols has not been included 
  in the GCM studies.</p>
<p>Kogan et al. (1996, 1997) used the Warren et al. (1988) cloud climatology over 
  the oceans rather than a GCM to predict the indirect effect by sulphate aerosols 
  on cloud albedo. The cloud albedo susceptibility was evaluated from a large 
  eddy simulation model applied to stratocumulus clouds. They found an indirect 
  short-wave forcing of -1.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> over the oceans with a small hemispheric 
  difference of 0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (i.e., a Northern to Southern Hemisphere ratio 
  of about 1.4). In their study, the forcing had a strong seasonal cycle, with 
  the Southern Hemisphere forcing prevailing in some seasons.</p>
