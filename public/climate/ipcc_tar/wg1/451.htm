<h4>12.2.3.3 Anthropogenic forcing </h4>
<p>In the SAR (Santer et al., 1996c), pattern-based detection studies took into 
  account changes in well-mixed greenhouse gases (often represented by an equivalent 
  increase in CO<sub>2</sub>), the direct effect of sulphate aerosols (usually 
  represented by a seasonally constant change in surface albedo) and the influence 
  of changes in strato-spheric ozone. Recent studies have also included the effect 
  of increases in tropospheric ozone and a representation of the indirect effect 
  of sulphate aerosols on cloud albedo. Many models now include the individual 
  greenhouse gases (as opposed to a CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent) and include an 
  interactive sulphur cycle and an explicit treatment of scattering by aerosols 
  (as opposed to using prescribed changes in surface albedo). Note that representation 
  of the sulphur cycle in climate models is not as detailed as in the offline 
  sulphur cycle models reported in <a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a>. Detection 
  and attribution studies to date have not taken into account other forcing agents 
  discussed in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>, including biogenic aerosols, black 
  carbon, mineral dust and changes in land use. Estimates of the spatial and temporal 
  variation of these factors have not been available long enough to have been 
  included in model simulations suitable for detection studies. In general, the 
  neglected forcings are estimated to be small globally and there may be a large 
  degree of cancellation in their global mean effect (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>, <a href="254.htm#fig68">Figure 6.8</a>). It is less clear that the individual 
  forcings will cancel regionally. As discussed in <a href="456.htm">Section 12.4</a>, 
  this will add further uncertainty in the attribution of the response to individual 
  forcing agents, although we believe it is unlikely to affect our conclusions 
  about the effects of increases in well-mixed greenhouse gases on very large 
  spatial scales. </p>
<p><i>Global mean anthropogenic forcing</i><br>
  The largest and most certain change in radiative forcing since the pre-industrial 
  period is an increase of about 2.3 Wm<sup>-2</sup> due to an increase in well-mixed 
  greenhouse gases (<a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>, <a href="254.htm#fig68">Figure 
  6.8</a> and <a href="221.htm#tab61">Table 6.1</a>). Radiative forcing here is 
  taken to be the net downward radiative flux at the tropopause (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>). Smaller, less certain contributions have come from increases in tropospheric 
  ozone (about 0.3 Wm<sup>-2</sup>), the direct effect of increases in sulphate 
  aerosols (about -0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) and decreases in stratospheric ozone (about 
  -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup>). There is a very uncertain and possibly large negative 
  contribution from the indirect effects of aerosols. Other factors such as that 
  due to increases in fossil fuel organic carbon, aviation, changes in land use 
  and mineral dust are very poorly known and not yet incorporated into simulations 
  used in formal detection studies. Their contribution is generally believed to 
  be small relative to well-mixed greenhouse gases, though they could be of importance 
  on regional scales. </p>
<p>In order to assess temperature changes over the last two decades, Hansen et 
  al. (1997b) estimated the net radiative forcing due to changes in greenhouse 
  gases (including ozone), solar variations and stratospheric aerosols from 1979 
  to 1995 from the best available measurements of the forcing agents. The negative 
  forcing due to volcanoes and decreases in stratospheric ozone compensated for 
  a substantial fraction of the increase in greenhouse gas forcing in this period 
  (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>, <a href="254.htm#tab613">Table 6.13</a>). 
</p>
<p><i>Patterns of anthropogenic forcing</i><br>
  Many of the new detection studies take into account the spatial variation of 
  climate response, which will depend to some extent on the pattern of forcing 
  (see also <a href="447.htm">Section 12.2.3</a>). The patterns of forcing vary 
  considerably (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>, <a href="253.htm#fig67">Figure 
  6.7</a>). The magnitude of the overall forcing due to increases in well-mixed 
  greenhouse gases varies from almost 3 Wm<sup>-2</sup> in the sub-tropics to 
  about 1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> around the poles. The warming due to increases in tropospheric 
  ozone is mainly in the tropics and northern sub-tropics. Decreases in stratospheric 
  ozone observed over the last couple of decades have produced negative forcing 
  of up to about 0.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup> around Antarctica. The direct effect of sulphate 
  aerosols predominates in the Northern Hemisphere industrial regions where the 
  negative forcing may exceed 2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> locally.</p>
<p><i>Temporal variations in forcing</i><br>
  Some of the new detection studies take into account the temporal as well as 
  spatial variations in climate response (see <a href="462.htm">Section 12.4.3.3</a>). 
  Hence the temporal variation of forcing is also important. The forcing due to 
  well-mixed greenhouse gases (and tropospheric ozone) has increased slowly in 
  the first half of the century, and much more rapidly in recent decades (<a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>, <a href="254.htm#fig68">Figure 6.8</a>). Contributions from other factors 
  are smaller and more uncertain. Sulphur emissions increased steadily until World 
  War I, then levelled off, and increased more rapidly in the 1950s, though not 
  as fast as greenhouse gas emissions. This is reflected in estimates of the direct 
  radiative effect of increases in sulphate aerosols. Given the almost monotonic 
  increase in greenhouse gas forcing in recent decades, this means the ratio of 
  sulphate to greenhouse gas forcing has probably been decreasing since about 
  1960 (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>, <a href="254.htm#fig68">Figure 6.8</a>). 
  This should be borne in mind when considering studies that attempt to detect 
  a response to sulphate aerosols. The decreases in stratospheric ozone have been 
  confined to the last two to three decades.</p>
<p><i>Uncertainties in aerosol forcing</i><br>
  Some recent studies have incorporated the indirect effect of increases in tropospheric 
  aerosols. This is very poorly understood (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>), 
  but contributes a negative forcing which could be negligible or exceed 2 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. 
  The upper limit would imply very little change in net global mean anthropogenic 
  forcing over the last century although there would still be a quite strong spatial 
  pattern of heating and cooling which may be incompatible with recent observed 
  changes (see, for example, Mitchell et al., 1995a). A negligible indirect sulphate 
  effect would imply a large increase in anthropogenic forcing in the last few 
  decades. There is also a large range in the inter-hemispheric asymmetry in the 
  different estimates of forcing (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>, <a href="232.htm#tab64">Table 
  6.4</a>). Given this high level of uncertainty, studies using simulations including 
  estimates of indirect sulphate forcing should be regarded as preliminary. </p>
<p><i>Summary</i><br>
  Well-mixed greenhouse gases make the largest and best-known contribution to 
  changes in radiative forcing over the last century or so. There remains a large 
  uncertainty in the magnitude and patterns of other factors, particularly those 
  associated with the indirect effects of sulphate aerosol.</p>
