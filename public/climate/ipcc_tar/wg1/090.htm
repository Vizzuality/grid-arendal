<p>A better understanding of the relationship between changes 
  in total precipitation and intense precipitation events has been achieved since 
  the SAR. Although many areas of the globe have not been analysed, and considerable 
  data remain inaccessible, enough data have been analysed to confirm some basic 
  properties of the changes in extreme precipitation. Groisman et al. (1999) developed 
  a simple statistical model of the frequency of daily precipitation based on 
  the gamma distribution. They applied this model to a variety of regions around 
  the world (40% of the global land area) during the season of greatest precipitation. 
  Although Wilks (1999) shows that the gamma distribution under some circumstances 
  can underestimate the probability of the highest rainfall amounts, Groisman 
  et al. (1999) applied the distribution to the upper 5 and 10 percentiles of 
  the distribution which are less subject to underestimation. Their analysis period 
  varied from region to region, but within each region it generally spanned at 
  least the last several decades, and for some regions much of the 20th century 
  (Australia, United States, Norway, and South Africa). In the model used by Groisman 
  et al. (1999), the mean total precipitation is also proportional to the shape 
  and scale parameters of the gamma distribution as well as to the probability 
  of precipitation on any given day. The shape parameter of the gamma distribution 
  tends to be relatively stable across a wide range of precipitation regimes, 
  in contrast to the scale parameter. Given the conservative nature of the shape 
  parameter, it is possible to illustrate the relationships between changes in 
  the mean total precipitation, the probability of precipitation (which is proportional 
  to the number of days with precipitation), and changes in heavy precipitation 
  (<a href="#fig234">Figure 2.34</a>). Given no change in the frequency 
  (number of days) of precipitation, a 10% change in the mean total precipitation 
  is amplified to a larger percentage change in heavy precipitation rates compared 
  to the change in the mean. Using the statistical theory of extremes, Katz (1999) 
  obtained results consistent with those of Groisman et al. (1999). For many regions 
  of the world it appears that the changes in the frequency or probability of 
  precipitation events are either small enough, or well enough expressed in the 
  high rainfall rates (Karl and Knight, 1998; Gruza et al., 1999; Haylock and 
  Nicholls, 2000) that an increase in the mean total precipitation is disproportionately 
  reflected in increased heavy precipitation rates (<a href="#fig235">Figure 
  2.35</a>).</p>
<p>Given the patterns of mean total precipitation changes (<a href="077.htm#252">Section 
  2.5.2</a>) during the 20th century, it could be anticipated that, in general, 
  for those areas with increased mean total precipitation, the percentage increase 
  in heavy precipitation rates should be significantly larger, and vice versa 
  for total precipitation decreases. Regional analyses of annual precipitation 
  in the United States (Karl and Knight, 1998; Trenberth, 1998a; Kunkel et al., 
  1999); Canada (Stone et al., 1999); Switzerland (Frei and Sch&auml;r, 2001); 
  Japan ( Iwashima and Yamamoto, 1993; Yamamoto and Sakurai, 1999); wintertime 
  precipitation in the UK (Osborn et al., 2000); and rainy season precipitation 
  in Norway, South Africa, the Nord Este of Brazil, and the former USSR (Groisman 
  et al., 1999; Gruza et al., 1999; Easterling et al., 2000) confirm this characteristic 
  of an amplified response for the heavy and extreme events. </p>
<p>Increases in heavy precipitation have also been documented 
  even when mean total precipitation decreases (for example, see Northern Japan 
  in <a href="#fig235">Figure 2.35</a>, or Manton et al., 2001). This can 
  occur when the probability of precipitation (the number of events) decreases, 
  or if the shape of the precipitation distribution changes, but this latter situation 
  is less likely (Buffoni et al., 1999; Groisman et al., 1999; Brunetti et al., 
  2000a,b). For example, in Siberia for the summer season during the years 1936 
  to 1994 there was a statistically significant decrease in total precipitation 
  of 1.3%/decade, but the number of days with precipitation also decreased. This 
  resulted in an increase (1.9%/decade) in the frequency of heavy rainfall above 
  25 mm. The opposite can also occur when the number of rainfall events increases; 
  thus F&oslash;rland et al. (1998) found no trends in 1-day annual maximum precipitation 
  in the Nordic countries, even when mean total precipitation increased. </p>
<p>There has also been a 10 to 45% increase in heavy rainfall, as defined by the 
  99th percentile of daily totals, over many regions of Australia from 1910 to 
  1995, but few individual trends were statistically significant (Hennessy et 
  al., 1999). In south-west Australia, however, a 15% decrease has been observed 
  in winter rainfall on very wet days (Hennessy et al., 1999; Haylock and Nicholls, 
  2000).</p>
<p>In Niger, a recent analysis of hourly rainfall data (Shinoda et al., 1999) 
  reveals that the droughts in the 1970s and 1980s were characterised primarily 
  by a reduced frequency of heavy rainfall events (those exceeding 30 mm/day) 
  rather than by a reduction in rainfall amount within heavy events. Such a result 
  is still consistent with the model of Groisman et al. (1999), as a decrease 
  in the frequency of rainfall events has been responsible for the decrease in 
  total rainfall. In the Sahel region of Nigeria, however, there has been a decrease 
  in the heaviest daily precipitation amounts, coincident with an overall decrease 
  in annual rainfall. This pattern is apparent throughout the Sudano-Sahel Zone, 
  including the Ethiopian plateau (Nicholson, 1993; Tarhule and Woo, 1998; Easterling 
  et al., 2000). Again, it is apparent that there has been an amplified response 
  of the heaviest precipitation rates relative to the percentage change in total 
  precipitation. </p>
<p>Since large portions of the mid- and high latitude land areas have had increasing 
  precipitation during the last half the 20th century, the question arises as 
  to how much of this area is affected by increases in heavy and extreme precipitation 
  rates. The Frich et al. (2001) analysis suggests an overall increase in the 
  area affected by more intense daily rainfall. <a href="#fig236">Figure 
  2.36</a> shows that widely distributed parts of the mid- and high latitudes 
  have locally statistically significant increases in both the proportion of mean 
  annual total precipitation falling into the upper five percentiles and in the 
  annual maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation total. However, for the regions 
  of the globe sampled taken as a whole, only the latter statistic shows a significant 
  increase. Regional analyses in Russia (Gruza et al., 1999), the United States 
  (Karl and Knight, 1998) and elsewhere (Groisman et al., 1999; Easterling et 
  al., 2000) confirm this trend. Although the trends are by no means uniform, 
  as would be anticipated with the relatively high spatial and interannual variability 
  of precipitation, about 10% of the stations analysed show statistically significant 
  increases at the 5% level. This equates to about a 4% increase in the annual 
  maximum 5-day precipitation total (<a href="#fig236">Figure 2.36b</a>). 
  The number of stations reflecting a locally significant increase in the proportion 
  of total annual precipitation occurring in the upper five percentiles of daily 
  precipitation totals outweighs the number of stations with significantly decreasing 
  trends by more than 3 to 1 (<a href="#fig236">Figure 2.36c</a>). Although 
  not statistically significant when averaging over all stations, there is about 
  a 1% increase in the proportion of daily precipitation events occurring in the 
  upper five percentiles (<a href="#fig236">Figure 2.36d</a>). Overall, 
  it is likely that there has been a 2 to 4% increase in the number of heavy precipitation 
  events when averaged across the mid- and high latitudes. </p>
<p>It has been noted that an increase (or decrease) in heavy precipitation events 
  may not necessarily translate into annual peak (or low) river levels. For example, 
  in the United States, Lins and Slack (1999) could not detect an increase in 
  the upper quantiles of streamflow, despite the documented increase in heavy 
  and extreme precipitation events. It is possible that this null result is partly 
  due to the method of analysis, but it is also attributable to the timing of 
  the annual peak streamflow discharge, which in the United States is usually 
  in late winter or early spring. A reduced snow cover extent in the mountainous 
  West changes the peak river flow, as does timing of increases in heavy and extreme 
  precipitation reported in the United States, which is best reflected during 
  the warm season. Groisman et al. (2001) and Zhang et al. (2000) also show reduced 
  peak streamflow in areas with reduced spring snow cover extent. Nonetheless, 
  in much of the United States where spring snow melt does not dominate peak or 
  normal flow, Groisman et al. (2001) show increasing high streamflow related 
  to increasing heavy precipitation. </p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the influence of warmer temperatures and increased water 
  vapour in the atmosphere (<a href="079.htm#253">Section 2.5.3</a>) are not independent 
  events, and are likely to be jointly related to increases in heavy and extreme 
  precipitation events.</p>
