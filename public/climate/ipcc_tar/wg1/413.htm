      <p align="center"><b>Box 11.2: Mass balance terms for glaciers, ice caps 
        and ice sheets</b></p>
      <p>A glacier, ice cap or ice sheet gains mass by accumulation of snow (snowfall 
        and deposition by wind-drift), which is gradually transformed to ice, 
        and loses mass (ablation) mainly by melting at the surface or base with 
        subsequent runoff or evaporation of the melt water. Some melt water may 
        refreeze within the snow instead of being lost, and some snow may sublimate 
        or be blown off the surface. Ice may also be removed by discharge into 
        a floating ice shelf or glacier tongue, from which it is lost by basal 
        melting and calving of icebergs. Net accumulation occurs at higher altitude, 
        net ablation at lower altitude; to compensate for net accumulation and 
        ablation, ice flows downhill by internal deformation of the ice and sliding 
        and bed deformation at the base. The rate at which this occurs is mainly 
        controlled by the surface slope, the ice thickness, the effective ice 
        viscosity, and basal thermal and physical conditions. The mass balance 
        for an individual body of ice is usually expressed as the rate of change 
        of the equivalent volume of liquid water, in m3/yr; the mass balance is 
        zero for a steady state. Mass balances are computed for both the whole 
        year and individual seasons; the winter mass balance mostly measures accumulation, 
        the summer, surface melting. The specific mass balance is the mass balance 
        averaged over the surface area, in m/yr. A mass balance sensitivity is 
        the derivative of the specific mass balance with respect to a climate 
        parameter which affects it. For instance, a mass balance sensitivity to 
        temperature is in m/yr/&deg;C.</p>

<h4><a name="11221"></a>11.2.2.1 Mass balance studies</h4>
<p>The water contained in glaciers and ice caps (excluding the ice sheets of Antarctica 
  and Greenland) is equivalent to about 0.5 m of global sea level (Table 11.3). 
  Glaciers and ice caps are rather sensitive to climate change; rapid changes 
  in their mass are possible, and are capable of producing an important contribution 
  to the rate of sea level rise. To evaluate this contribution, we need to know 
  the rate of change of total glacier mass. Unfortunately sufficient measurements 
  exist to determine the mass balance (see Box 11.2 for definition) for only a 
  small minority of the world's 105 glaciers.</p>

</table>
<p><a name="fig112"></a>A possible approximate approach to this problem is to 
  group glaciers into climatic regions, assuming glaciers in the same region to 
  have a similar specific mass balance. With this method, we need to know only 
  the specific mass balance for a typical glacier in each region (Kuhn et al., 
  1999) and the total glacier area of the region. Multiplying these together gives 
  the rate of change of glacier mass in the region. We then sum over all regions.</p>
<p>In the past decade, estimates of the regional totals of area and volume have 
  been improved by the application of high resolution remote sensing and, to a 
  lesser extent, by radio-echo-sounding. New glacier inventories have been published 
  for central Asia and the former Soviet Union (Dolgushin and Osipova, 1989; Liu 
  et al., 1992; Kuzmichenok, 1993; Shi et al., 1994; Liu and Xie, 2000; Qin et 
  al., 2000), New Zealand (Chinn, 1991), India (Kaul, 1999) South America (Casassa, 
  1995; Hastenrath and Ames, 1995; Skvarca et al., Aniya et al, 1997; Kaser, 1999; 
  1995; Kaser et al., 1996; Rott et al., 1998), and new estimates made for glaciers 
  in Antarctica and Greenland apart from the ice sheets (Weidick and Morris, 1996). 
</p>
<p>By contrast, specific mass balance is poorly known. Continuous mass balance 
  records longer than 20 years exist for about forty glaciers worldwide, and about 
  100 have records of more than five years (Dyurgerov and Meier, 1997a). Very 
  few have both winter and summer balances; these data are critical to relating 
  glacier change to climatic elements (Dyurgerov and Meier, 1999). Although mass 
  balance is being monitored on several dozen glaciers worldwide, these are mostly 
  small (&lt;20 km<sup>2</sup>) and not representative of the size class that 
  contains the majority of the mass (&gt;100 km<sup>2</sup>). The geographical 
  coverage is also seriously deficient; in particular, we are lacking information 
  on the most important maritime glacier areas. Specific mass balance exhibits 
  wide variation geographically and over time (Figure 11.2). While glaciers in 
  most parts of the world have had negative mass balance in the past 20 years, 
  glaciers in New Zealand (Chinn, 1999; Lamont et al., 1999) and southern Scandinavia 
  (Tvede and Laumann, 1997) have been advancing, presumably following changes 
  in the regional climate.</p>

<p>Estimates of the historical global glacier contribution to sea level rise are 
  shown in Table 11.4. Dyurgerov and Meier (1997a) obtained their estimate by 
  dividing a large sample of measured glaciers into seven major regions and finding 
  the mass balance for each region, including the glaciers around the ice sheets. 
  Their area-weighted average for 1961 to 1990 was equivalent to 0.25 &plusmn; 
  0.10 mm/yr of sea level rise. Cogley and Adams (1998) estimated a lower rate 
  for 1961 to 1990. However, their results may be not be representative of the 
  global average because they do not make a correction for the regional biases 
  in the sample of well investigated glaciers (Oerlemans, 1999). When evaluating 
  data based on observed mass balance, one should note a worldwide glacier retreat 
  following the high stand of the middle 19th century and subsequent small regional 
  readvances around 1920 and 1980. </p>
