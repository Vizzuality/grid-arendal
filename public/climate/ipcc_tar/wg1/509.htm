<h3>14.2.4 The Global Carbon Cycle</h3>
<p>From measurements of air trapped in ice cores and from direct measurements 
  of the atmosphere, we know that in the past 200 years the abundance of CO<sub>2</sub> in 
  the atmosphere has increased by over 30% (i.e., from a concentration of 280 
  ppm by volume (pppmv) in 1700 to nearly 370 ppmv in 2000). We also know that 
  the concentration was relatively constant (roughly within &plusmn;10 ppmv of 
  275) for more than 1,000 years prior to the human-induced rapid increase in 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (see <a href="105.htm#fig32">Chapter 3, Figures 3.2a and 3.2b</a>). 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Looking further back in time, we find an extraordinarily regular record of 
  change. The Vostok core (<a href="105.htm#fig32">Figure 3.2d</a>) captures a 
  remarkable and intriguing signal of the periodicity of inter-glacial and glacial 
  climate periods in step with the transfer of significant pools of carbon from 
  the land (most likely through the atmosphere) to the ocean and then the recovery 
  of terrestrial carbon back from the ocean. The repeated pattern of a 100 to 
  120 ppmv decline in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> from an inter-glacial value of 280 to 300 
  ppmv to a 180 ppmv floor and then the rapid recovery as the planet exits glaciation 
  suggests a tightly governed control system. There is a similar methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) 
  cycle between 320 to 350 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) and 650 to 770 ppbv. 
  What begs explanation is not just the linked periodicity of carbon and glaciation, 
  but also the apparent consistent limits on the cycles over the period. See <a href="106.htm#box34">Chapter 
  3, Box 3.4</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's atmosphere, imprinted with the fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> signal, stands 
  at nearly 90 to 70 ppmv above the previous inter-glacial maximum of 280 to 300 
  ppmv. The current methane value is even further (percentage-wise) from its previous 
  inter-glacial high values. In essence, carbon has been moved from a relatively 
  immobile pool (in fossil fuel reserves) in the slow carbon cycle to the relatively 
  mobile pool (the atmosphere) in the fast carbon cycle, and the ocean, terrestrial 
  vegetation and soils have yet to equilibrate with this "rapidly" changing 
  concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.<br>
</p>
<p>Given this remarkable and unprecedented history one cannot help but wonder 
  about the characteristics of the carbon cycle in the future (<a href="095.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>). To understand better the global carbon cycle, two themes are clear: 
  (1) there is a need for global observations that can contribute significantly 
  to determining the sources and sinks of carbon and (2) there is a need for fundamental 
  work on critical biological processes and their interaction with the physical 
  system. Two observational needs must be highlighted:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Observations that would decisively improve our ability to model the carbon 
    cycle. For example, a dense and well-calibrated network for monitoring CO<sub>2</sub> 
    and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations that will also be required for international verification 
    of carbon sources and sinks is central.<br>
  </li>
  <li>"Benchmarks" data sets that allow model intercomparison activities 
    to move in the direction of becoming data-model comparisons and not just model-model 
    comparisons.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We note that the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) 
  of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) recognised 
  the importance of an Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership in developing 
  observing systems for the oceans and terrestrial carbon sources and sinks in 
  the global carbon cycle and in promoting systematic observations.<br>
</p>
<p>There is also a range of areas where present day biogeochemistry modelling 
  is not only in need of additional data, but is also crucially limited by insufficient 
  understanding at the level of physical or biological processes. Clarifying these 
  processes and their controls is central to a better understanding of the global 
  carbon cycle.</p>
