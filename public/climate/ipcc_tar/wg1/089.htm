<h3><a name="272"></a>2.7.2 Is There Evidence for Changes in Variability or <br>
  Extremes? </h3>
<p>The issues involved in measuring and assessing changes in extremes have recently 
  been comprehensively reviewed by Trenberth and Owen (1999), Nicholls and Murray 
  (1999), and Folland et al. (1999b). Despite some progress described below, there 
  remains a lack of accessible daily climate data sets which can be intercompared 
  over large regions (Folland et al., 2000). Extremes are a key aspect of climate 
  change. Changes in the frequency of many extremes (increases or decreases) can 
  be surprisingly large for seemingly modest mean changes in climate (Katz, 1999) 
  and are often the most sensitive aspects of climate change for ecosystem and 
  societal responses. Moreover, changes in extremes are often most sensitive to 
  inhomogeneous climate monitoring practices, making assessment of change more 
  difficult than assessing the change in the mean.</p>
<h4><a name="2721"></a>2.7.2.1 Temperature</h4>
<p>Given the number of ways in which extreme climate events and variability about 
  the mean can be defined, (e.g., extreme daily temperatures, large areas experiencing 
  unusual temperatures, severity of heat waves, number of frosts or freezes, changes 
  in interannual variability of large area temperatures, etc.) extreme care must 
  be exercised in generalising results. Here we assess the evidence for changes 
  in temperature extremes or variability, first based on global analyses and then 
  on more detailed regional analyses. </p>
<p>Parker et al. (1994) compared the interannual variability of seasonal temperature 
  anomalies from the 1954 to 1973 period to the 1974 to 1993 period for most of 
  the globe. They found a small increase in variability overall with an especially 
  large increase in central North America. By restricting the analyses to the 
  latter half of the 20th century, Parker et al. (1994) minimised the potential 
  biases due to an increasing number of observations in this period. Several other 
  studies found a reduction in other aspects of variability over longer time periods. 
  Jones (1999) also analysed global data and found no change in variability, but 
  since 1951 the rise in global mean temperatures can be attributed to an increase 
  (decrease) in areas with much above (below) normal temperatures. They also analysed 
  the change in the aggregated total of much below and much above normal temperatures 
  (upper and lower ten percentiles). They found little overall change, except 
  for a reduced number of much above or below normal temperatures during the 1960s 
  and 1970s. Michaels et al. (1998) examined 5&deg; latitude x 5&deg; longitude 
  monthly temperature anomalies for many grid cells around the world and found 
  an overall decrease in intra-annual variance over the past 50 to 100 years. 
  They also examined the daily maximum and minimum temperatures from the United 
  States, China, and the former Soviet Union and found a general decline in the 
  intra-monthly temperature variability. As reported in the SAR, a related analysis 
  by Karl et al. (1995b) found reduced day-to-day variability during the 20th 
  century in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in the United States and China. 
  Recently, Collins et al. (2000) has identified similar trends in Australia. 
  By analysing a long homogenised daily temperature index for four stations in 
  Northern Europe, Moberg et al. (2000) also found a progressive reduction in 
  all-seasons inter-daily variability of about 7% between 1880 and 1998. Balling 
  (1998) found an overall decrease in the spatial variance of both satellite-based 
  lower-tropospheric measurements from 1979 to 1996 and in near-surface air temperatures 
  from 1897 to 1996. </p>
<p>Consequently, there is now little evidence to suggest that the interannual 
  variability of global temperatures has increased over the past few decades, 
  but there is some evidence to suggest that the variability of intra-annual temperatures 
  has actually quite widely decreased. Several analyses find a decrease in spatial 
  and temporal variability of temperatures on these shorter time-scales.</p>

      between the first and last half of the period, approximately 1946 to 1999. 
      The red circles indicate negative changes and the blue circles indicate 
      positive changes. Panel (c) shows percentage changes in the maximum number 
      of consecutive days (for periods with &gt;5 such days) with maximum temperatures 
      &gt;5&deg;C above the 1961 to 1990 daily normal. The changes are for the 
      first and second half of the period, approximately 1946 to 1999. The red 
      circles indicate positive changes and the blue circles indicate negative 
      changes. In both panels, the size of each circle reflects the size of the 
      change and solid circles represent statistically significant changes. Panels 
      (b) and (d) show the average annual values of these quantities expressed 
      as percentage differences from their 1961 to 1990 average values. The trend

<p>There have been a number of new regional studies related to changes in extreme 
  temperature events during the 20th century. Gruza et al. (1999) found statistically 
  significant increases in the number of days with extreme high temperatures across 
  Russia using data back to 1961 and on a monthly basis back to 1900. Frich et 
  al. (2001) analysed data spanning the last half of the 20th century across most 
  of the Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes and found a statistically 
  significant increase (5 to &gt;15%) in the growing season length in many regions. 
  Heino et al. (1999) also found that there has been a reduction in the number 
  of days with frost (the number of days with minimum temperature <img src="images/ltoe.gif" width="8" height="12">0&deg;C) 
  in northern and central Europe. Thus, some stations now have as many as 50 fewer 
  days of frost per year compared with earlier in the 20th century. Easterling 
  et al. (2000) found there has been a significant decrease in the number of days 
  below freezing over the central United States (about seven per year). For Canada, 
  Bonsal et al. (2001) also found fewer days with extreme low temperatures during 
  winter, spring and summer, and more days with extreme high temperatures during 
  winter and spring. This has led to a significant increase in the frost-free 
  period. Decreasing numbers of days with freezing temperatures have been found 
  in Australia and New Zealand over recent decades (Plummer et al., 1999; Collins 
  et al., 2000). In addition, while increases in the frequency of warm days have 
  been observed, decreases in the number of cool nights have been stronger. Frich 
  et al. (2001) show a reduced number of days with frost across much of the globe 
  (<a href="#fig233">Figure 2.33</a>) while Michaels et al. (2000) find 
  that much of the warming during the 20th century has been during the cold season 
  in the mid- to high latitudes, consistent with the reduction of extremely low 
  temperatures. Frich et al. (2001) have also found a statistically significant 
  reduction in the difference between the annual extremes of daily maximum and 
  minimum temperatures during the latter half of the 20th century. In China, strong 
  increases in the absolute minimum temperature have been observed, with decreases 
  in the 1-day seasonal extreme maximum temperature (Zhai et al., 1999a) since 
  the 1950s. Wang and Gaffen (2001), however, for a similar period, found an increase 
  in "hot" days in China. Hot days were defined as those days above 
  the 85th percentile during July and August based on an "apparent temperature" 
  index related to human discomfort in China (Steadman, 1984). The number of extremely 
  cold days has also been shown to be decreasing in China (Zhai et al., 1999a). 
  Manton et al. (2001) found significant increases in hot days and warm nights, 
  and decreases in cool days and cold nights since 1961 across the Southeast Asia 
  and South Pacific Region. Jones et al. (1999c) have analysed the 230-year-long 
  daily central England data set that has been adjusted for observing inhomogeneities. 
  They found that the increase in temperature observed in central England corresponds 
  mainly to a reduction in the frequency of much below normal daily temperatures. 
  An increase of the frequency of much above normal temperatures was less apparent. 
</p>
<p>Analyses of 20th century trends in the United States of short-duration episodes 
  (a few days) of extreme hot or cold weather did not show any significant changes 
  in frequency or intensity (Kunkel et al., 1996, 1999; Karl and Knight, 1997). 
  For Australia, Collins et al. (2000) found higher frequencies of multi-day warm 
  nights and days, and decreases in the frequency of cool days and nights. In 
  an extensive assessment of the change in frequency of heat waves during the 
  latter half of the 20th century, Frich et al. (2001) find some evidence for 
  an increase in heat-wave frequency, but several regions have opposite trends 
  (<a href="#fig233">Figure 2.33c</a>). The extreme heat in the United 
  States during several years in the 1930s dominates the time-series of heat waves 
  in that region. On the other hand, trends in the frequency of extreme apparent 
  temperatures are significantly larger for 1949 to 1995 during summer over most 
  of the USA (Gaffen and Ross, 1998). Warm humid nights more than doubled in number 
  over 1949 to 1995 at some locations. Trends in nocturnal apparent temperature 
  in the USA, however, are likely to be associated, in part, with increased urbanisation. 
  Nevertheless, using methods and data sets to minimise urban heat island effects 
  and instrument changes, Easterling et al. (2000) arrived at conclusions similar 
  to those of Gaffen and Ross (1998). </p>
<p>During the 1997/98 El Ni&ntilde;o event, global temperature records were broken 
  for sixteen consecutive months from May 1997 through to August 1998. Karl et 
  al. (2000) describe this as an unusual event and such a monthly sequence is 
  unprecedented in the observational record. More recently, Wigley (2000) argues 
  that if it were not for the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, an approximately equal 
  number of record-breaking temperatures would have been set during the El Ni&ntilde;o 
  of 1990/91. As temperatures continue to warm, more events like these are likely, 
  especially when enhanced by other factors, such as El Ni&ntilde;o.</p>
