<h1>D. The Simulation of the Climate System and its Changes</h1>
The preceding two Sections reported on the climate from the distant past to the 
present day through the observations of climate variables and the forcing agents 
that cause climate to change. This Section bridges to the climate of the future 
by describing the only tool that provides quantitative estimates of future climate 
changes, namely, numerical models. The basic understanding of the energy balance 
of the Earth system means that quite simple models can provide a broad quantitative 
estimate of some globally averaged variables, but more accurate estimates of feedbacks 
and of regional detail can only come from more elaborate climate models. The complexity 
of the processes in the climate system prevents the use of extrapolation of past 
trends or statistical and other purely empirical techniques for projections. Climate 
models can be used to simulate the climate responses to different input scenarios 
of future forcing agents (<a href="029.htm">Section F</a>). Similarly, projection 
of the fate of emitted CO<sub>2</sub> (i.e., the relative sequestration into the 
various reservoirs) and other greenhouse gases requires an understanding of the 
biogeochemical processes involved and incorporating these into a numerical carbon 
cycle model.<br>
<p>A climate model is a simplified mathematical representation of the Earth's 
climate system (see <a href="#box3">Box 3</a>). The degree to which the model can simulate the responses 
of the climate system hinges to a very large degree on the level of understanding 
of the physical, geophysical, chemical and biological processes that govern the 
climate system. Since the SAR, researchers have made substantial improvements 
in the simulation of the Earth's climate system with models. First, the current 
understanding of some of the most important processes that govern the climate 
system and how well they are represented in present climate models are summarised 
here. Then, this Section presents an assessment of the overall ability of present 
models to make useful projections of future climate.</p>

      <p><b>Box 3: Climate Models: How are they built and how are they applied?</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>Comprehensive climate models are based on physical laws represented by 
        mathematical equations that are solved using a three-dimensional grid 
        over the globe. For climate simulation, the major components of the climate 
        system must be represented in sub-models (atmosphere, ocean, land surface, 
        cryosphere and biosphere), along with the processes that go on within 
        and between them. Most results in this report are derived from the results 
        of models, which include some representation of all these components. 
        Global climate models in which the atmosphere and ocean components have 
        been coupled together are also known as Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation 
        Models (AOGCMs). In the atmospheric module, for example, equations are 
        solved that describe the large-scale evolution of momentum, heat and moisture. 
        Similar equations are solved for the ocean. Currently, the resolution 
        of the atmospheric part of a typical model is about 250 km in the horizontal 
        and about 1 km in the vertical above the boundary layer. The resolution 
        of a typical ocean model is about 200 to 400 m in the vertical, with a 
        horizontal resolution of about 125 to 250 km. Equations are typically 
        solved for every half hour of a model integration. Many physical processes, 
        such as those related to clouds or ocean convection, take place on much 
        smaller spatial scales than the model grid and therefore cannot be modelled 
        and resolved explicitly. Their average effects are approximately included 
        in a simple way by taking advantage of physically based relationships 
        with the larger-scale variables. This technique is known as parametrization.</p>

      <p>In order to make quantitative projections of future climate change, it 
        is necessary to use climate models that simulate all the important processes 
        governing the future evolution of the climate. Climate models have developed 
        over the past few decades as computing power has increased. During that 
        time, models of the main components, atmosphere, land, ocean and sea ice 
        have been developed separately and then gradually integrated. This coupling 
        of the various components is a difficult process. Most recently, sulphur 
        cycle components have been incorporated to represent the emissions of 
        sulphur and how they are oxidised to form aerosol particles. Currently 
        in progress, in a few models, is the coupling of the land carbon cycle 
        and the ocean carbon cycle. The atmospheric chemistry component currently 
        is modelled outside the main climate model. The ultimate aim is, of course, 
        to model as much as possible of the whole of the Earth's climate 
        system so that all the components can interact and, thus, the predictions 
        of climate change will continuously take into account the effect of feedbacks 
        among components. The Figure above shows the past, present and possible 
        future evolution of climate models.</p>
      <p>Some models offset errors and surface flux imbalances through "flux 
        adjustments", which are empirically determined systematic adjustments 
        at the atmosphere-ocean interface held fixed in time in order to bring 
        the simulated climate closer to the observed state. A strategy has been 
        designed for carrying out climate experiments that removes much of the 
        effects of some model errors on results. What is often done is that first 
        a "control" climate simulation is run with the model. Then, 
        the climate change experiment simulation is run, for example, with increased 
        CO<sub>2</sub> in the model atmosphere. Finally, the difference is taken to provide 
        an estimate of the change in climate due to the perturbation. The differencing 
        technique removes most of the effects of any artificial adjustments in 
        the model, as well as systematic errors that are common to both runs. 
        However, a comparison of different model results makes it apparent that 
        the nature of some errors still influences the outcome.</p>
      <p>Many aspects of the Earth's climate system are chaotic - its 
        evolution is sensitive to small perturbations in initial conditions. This 
        sensitivity limits predictability of the detailed evolution of weather 
        to about two weeks. However, predictability of climate is not so limited 
        because of the systematic influences on the atmosphere of the more slowly 
        varying components of the climate system. Nevertheless, to be able to 
        make reliable forecasts in the presence of both initial condition and 
        model uncertainty, it is desirable to repeat the prediction many times 
        from different perturbed initial states and using different global models. 
        These ensembles are the basis of probability forecasts of the climate 
        state.</p>
      <p>Comprehensive AOGCMs are very complex and take large computer resources 
        to run. To explore different scenarios of emissions of greenhouse gases 
        and the effects of assumptions or approximations in parameters in the 
        model more thoroughly, simpler models are also widely used. The simplifications 
        may include coarser resolution and simplified dynamics and physical processes. 
        Together, simple, intermediate, and comprehensive models form a "hierarchy 
        of climate models", all of which are necessary to explore choices 
        made in parametrizations and assess the robustness of climate changes.</p>
