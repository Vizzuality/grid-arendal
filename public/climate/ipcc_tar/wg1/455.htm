<h3>12.3.3 Hydrological Indicators </h3>
<p>As discussed in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, there is less confidence in 
  observed variations in hydrological indicators than for surface temperature, 
  because of the difficulties in taking such measurements and the small-scale 
  variations of precipitation. There is general consistency between the changes 
  in mean precipitation in the tropics over the last few decades and changes in 
  ENSO. There is no general consistency between observed changes in mean tropical 
  precipitation and model simulations. In middle and high latitudes in the Northern 
  Hemisphere, the observed increase in precipitation is consistent with most model 
  simulations. Observed changes in ocean salinity in the Southern Ocean appear 
  to be consistent with increased precipitation there, as expected from model 
  simulations (Wong et al., 1999; Banks et al., 2000).</p>
<p>The observed increases in the intensity of heavy precipitation in the tropics 
  and in convective weather systems described in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a> 
  are consistent with moist thermodynamics in a warmer atmosphere and model simulations. 
  Observed increases of water vapour in the lower troposphere in regions where 
  there is adequate data coverage are also consistent with model simulations. 
  As discussed in <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>, different theories suggest 
  opposite variations of water vapour in the upper troposphere associated with 
  an increased greenhouse effect and surface warming. The quality, amount and 
  coverage of water vapour data in the upper troposphere do not appear to be sufficient 
  to resolve this issue.</p>
<h3><a name="1234"></a>12.3.4 Circulation</h3>
<p>In middle and high latitudes of both hemispheres, there has been a trend over 
  the last few decades towards one phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation/Arctic 
  Oscillation and of the Antarctic high latitude mode, sometimes also referred 
  to as "annular modes", (<a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>; Thompson 
  et al., 2000). These are approximately zonally symmetric modes of variability 
  of the atmospheric circulation. Both trends have been associated with reduced 
  surface pressure at high latitudes, stronger high latitude jets, a stronger 
  polar vortex in the winter lower stratosphere and, in the Northern Hemisphere, 
  winter warming over the western parts of the continents associated with increased 
  warm advection from ocean regions. The trend is significant and cannot be explained 
  by internal variability in some models (Gillett et al., 2000b). These dynamical 
  changes explain only part of the observed Northern Hemisphere warming (Gillett 
  et al., 2000b; Thompson et al., 2000). Modelling studies suggest a number of 
  possible causes of these circulation changes, including greenhouse gas increases 
  (Fyfe et al., 1999; Paeth et al., 1999; Shindell et al., 1999) and stratospheric 
  ozone decreases (Graf et al., 1998; Volodin and Galin, 1999). Some studies have 
  also shown that volcanic eruptions (Graf et al., 1998; Mao and Robock, 1998; 
  Kirchner et al., 1999) can induce such changes in circulation on interannual 
  time-scales. Shindell et al. (2001) show that both solar and volcanic forcing 
  are unlikely to explain the recent trends in the annular modes. </p>
<p>The majority of models simulate the correct sign of the observed trend in the 
  North Atlantic or Arctic Oscillation when forced with anthropogenic increases 
  in greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols, but almost all underestimate the 
  magnitude of the trend (e.g., Osborn et al., 1999; Gillett et al., 2000b; Shindell 
  et al., 1999). Some studies suggest that a better resolved stratosphere is necessary 
  to simulate the correct magnitude of changes in dynamics involving the annular 
  modes (e.g., Shindell et al., 2001).</p>
<h3><a name="1235"></a>12.3.5 Combined Evidence </h3>
<p>The combination of independent but consistent evidence should strengthen our 
  confidence in identifying a human influence on climate. The physical and dynamical 
  consistency of most of the thermal and hydrological changes described above 
  supports this conclusion. However, it is important to bear in mind that much 
  of this evidence is associated with a global and regional pattern of warming 
  and therefore cannot be considered to be completely independent evidence. </p>
<p>An elicitation of individual experts' subjective assessment of evidence 
  for climate change detection and attribution is being carried out (Risbey et 
  al., 2000). This will help to better understand the nature of the consensus 
  amongst experts on the subject of climate change attribution.</p>
