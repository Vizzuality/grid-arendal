<h2>8.1 Summary of Second Assessment Report </h2>
<p>The systematic evaluation of coupled climate models was only beginning to emerge 
  at the time of the IPCC WGI Second Assess-ment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter 
  SAR). Suitable formalisms for evaluating fully coupled models were in very early 
  stages of development whereas considerable progress had been made in the evaluation 
  of the performance of individual components (atmosphere, ocean, land surface 
  and sea ice and their interactions).</p>
<p>The need for flux adjustment and the widely varying spin-up methodologies in 
  coupled models were areas of concern and the need for a more systematic evaluation 
  of these on the simulated climate was expressed. It was noted that, although 
  flux adjustments were generally large in those models that used them, the absence 
  of flux adjustment generally affected the realism of the simulated climate and 
  could adversely affect the associated feedback processes. It was hoped that 
  the need for flux adjustment would diminish as components were improved.<br>
  A new feature of coupled model evaluation was an analysis of the variability 
  of the coupled system over a range of time-scales. The new opportunities that 
  provided for more comprehensive evaluation were an important component of the 
  overall assessment of coupled model capabilities.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the performance of individual components of the coupled system 
  (especially for atmosphere-only models) was much more advanced than previously. 
  Results from the first phase of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project 
  (AMIP) demonstrated that "current atmospheric models generally provide 
  a realistic portrayal of the phase and amplitude of the seasonal march of the 
  large-scale distribution of temperature, pressure and circulation". The 
  simulation of clouds and their seasonal variation was noted as the major source 
  of uncertainty in atmospheric models. In general it was found that "atmospheric 
  models respond realistically to large-scale sea surface temperature (SST) patterns" 
  and hence can reproduce many facets of interannual variability. In the case 
  of the land-surface component, however, it was noted that "the general 
  agreement found among the results of relatively simple land-surface schemes 
  in 1990 has been reduced by the introduction of more complex parametrizations". 
  Ocean and sea-ice models were found to "portray the observed large-scale 
  distribution of temperature, salinity and sea ice more accurately than in 1990", 
  but some reservations were expressed regarding the possible adverse effects 
  of the relatively coarse resolution of the ocean components of current coupled 
  models.</p>
<p>The overall assessment of coupled models was that "current models are 
  now able to simulate many aspects of the observed climate with a useful level 
  of skill" and "model simulations are most accurate at large space 
  scales (e.g., hemispheric or continental); at regional scales skill is lower".</p>
