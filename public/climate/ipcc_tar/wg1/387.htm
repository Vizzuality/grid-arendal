<h2>10.4 GCMs with Variable and Increased Horizontal Resolution </h2>
<p>This section deals with the relatively new idea of deriving regional climate 
  information from AGCMs with variable and increased horizontal resolution. Although 
  the basic methodology is suggested in the work of Bengtsson et al. (1995), where 
  a high resolution GCM was used to simulate changes in tropical cyclones in a 
  warmer climate, it is only in the last few years that such models have been 
  used more widely to predict regional aspects of climate change. Even so, only 
  a limited number of experiments have been conducted to date (see <a href="#tab101">Table 
  10.1</a>) and hence what follows is not a definitive evaluation of the technique 
  but an initial exploration of its potential.</p>

<h3><a name="1041"></a>10.4.1 Simulations of Current Climate</h3>
<p>Analysis of current climate simulations has considered both deviations from 
  the observed climate and effects of changes in resolution on the model's 
  climatology. Most studies have considered just the mean climate and some measures 
  of variability, either globally or for a particular region of interest. The 
  only extreme behaviour studied in any detail was the simulation of tropical 
  cyclones. Even for mean climate, no comprehensive assessment of the surface 
  climatology of variable or high resolution models has been attempted. Europe 
  has been the most common area of study to date, although southern Asia and the 
  polar regions have also received attention</p>

<p><a name="fig108"></a>The mean circulation is generally well simulated by AGCMs, 
  though relatively large regional-scale biases can still be present. Many features 
  of the large-scale climate of AGCMs are retained at higher resolution (D&egrave;qu&egrave; 
  and Piedelievre, 1995; Stendel and Roeckner, 1998; May, 1999; Stratton, 1999a). 
  A common change is a poleward shift of the extra-tropical storm track regions. 
  It has been suggested that this is linked to a general deepening of cyclones, 
  noted as a common feature in high-resolution atmospheric models (Machenhauer 
  et al., 1996; Stratton 1999a). More intense activity is also seen at higher 
  resolution in the tropics. For example, a stronger Hadley circulation was observed 
  in ECHAM4 and HadAM3a that worsened agreement with observations (Stendel and 
  Roeckner, 1998; Stratton, 1999b).</p>
<p>The repositioning of the storm tracks generally improves the simulations in 
  the Northern Hemisphere, as it reduces a positive polar surface pressure bias 
  which is present in the models at standard resolution. In the case of HadAM3a, 
  this leads to substantial improvements in Northern Hemisphere low level flow 
  in winter (<a href="#fig108">Figure 10.8</a>). In the Southern Hemisphere, the 
  impact on the circumpolar flow is not consistently positive across models (<a href="#fig108">Figure 
  10.8</a>; Krinner et al., 1997). In ECHAM4 and HadAM3a, increased resolution 
  has little impact on the negative surface pressure bias over the tropics but 
  improves the low-level South Asian monsoon flow (Lal et al., 1997; Stratton, 
  1999b).</p>
<p>The existence of these common responses to increased resolution suggests that 
  they result from improved representation of the resolved variables. In contrast, 
  an increase in the intensity of sub-tropical anticyclones observed in ECHAM4 
  results from a tropospheric warming promoted by excessive cirrus clouds attributed 
  to a scale-dependent response in the relevant parametrization (Stendel and Roeckner, 
  1998).</p>
<p>The aim of increasing resolution in AGCMs is generally to improve the simulation 
  of surface climatology compared to coarser resolution models (Cubash et al., 
  1995). Early experience shows a much more mixed response. ECHAM3 at T42 improved 
  the seasonal cycle of surface temperature in seven regions, compared to the 
  driving AOGCM, but overall surface temperature was too high (by 2 to 5&ordm;C). 
  Increasing the resolution to T106 did not improve winter temperatures and, in 
  summer, the spatial patterns were better but the regional biases worse (Cubasch 
  et al., 1996). For precipitation, spatial patterns were improved in summer but 
  degraded in winter. The summer warming was due to excessive insolation from 
  reduced cloud cover and overly transparent clear skies (Wild et al., 1995). 
  Improved physics in ECHAM4 reduced some of the radiation errors but the precipitation 
  and temperature biases remained (Wild et al, 1996; Stendel and Roeckner, 1998). 
  In simulations of European climate with ARPEGE (D&egrave;qu&egrave; and Piedelievre, 
  1995) and HadAM2b/3a (Jones, 1999; Stratton, 1999a), improved flow at higher 
  resolution generally led to better surface temperatures and precipitation. However, 
  over south-eastern Europe, precipitation biases increased in both models, as 
  did the warm temperature bias in HadAM3a.</p>
<p>The increased summer temperatures in Europe in HadAM3a were caused by reduced 
  cloud cover at higher resolution (Jones 1999) and warming and drying, in summer, 
  was seen over all extra-tropical continents (Stratton, 1999b). This clearly 
  demonstrates a potential drawback of increasing the resolution of a model without 
  comprehensively retuning the physics. Krinner et al. (1997) showed that, to 
  obtain a reasonable simulation of the surface climatology of the Antarctic with 
  the LMD variable resolution AGCM, many modifications to the model physics were 
  required. The model was then able to simulate surface temperatures to within 
  2 to 4&ordm;C of observations and to provide a good simulation of the ice mass 
  balance (snow accumulation), with both aspects being better than at standard 
  resolution.</p>
