<p><a name="fig78"></a>The strongest natural fluctuation of climate on interannual 
  time-scales is the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, and 
  ENSO-like fluctuations also dominate decadal time-scales (sometimes referred 
  to as the Pacific decadal oscillation). ENSO originates in the tropical Pacific 
  but affects climate conditions globally. The importance of changes in ENSO as 
  the climate changes and its potential role in possible abrupt shifts have only 
  recently been appreciated. Observations and modelling of ENSO are addressed 
  in <a href="048.htm">Chapters 2</a>, <a href="308.htm">8</a> and <a href="338.htm">9</a>; 
  here the underlying processes are discussed. Observational and modelling results 
  suggest that more frequent or stronger ENSO events are possible in the future. 
  Because social and ecological systems are particularly vulnerable to rapid changes 
  in climate, for the next decades, these may prove of greater consequence than 
  a gradual rise in mean temperature.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="7651"></a>7.6.5.1 ENSO processes<br>
</h4>
<p>ENSO is generated by ocean-atmosphere interactions internal to the tropical 
  Pacific and overlying atmosphere. Positive temperature anomalies in the eastern 
  equatorial Pacific (characteristic of an El Ni&ntilde;o event) reduce the normally 
  large sea surface temperature difference across the tropical Pacific. As a consequence, 
  the trade winds weaken, the Southern Oscillation index (defined as the sea level 
  pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin) becomes anomalously negative, 
  and sea level falls in the west and rises in the east by as much as 25 cm as 
  warm waters extend eastward along the equator. At the same time, these weakened 
  trades reduce the upwelling of cold water in the eastern equatorial Pacific, 
  thereby strengthening the initial positive temperature anomaly. The weakened 
  trades also cause negative off-equatorial thermocline depth anomalies in the 
  central and western Pacific. These anomalies propagate westward to Indonesia, 
  where they are reflected and propagate eastward along the equator. Thus some 
  time after their generation, these negative anomalies cause the temperature 
  anomaly in the east to decrease and change sign. The combination of the tropical 
  air-sea instability and the delayed negative feedback due to sub-surface ocean 
  dynamics can give rise to oscillations (for a summary of theories see Neelin 
  et al., 1998). Two of these feedbacks are schematically illustrated in <a href="#fig78">Figure 
  7.8</a>. Beyond influencing tropical climate, ENSO seems to have a global influence: 
  during and following El Ni&ntilde;o, the global mean surface temperature increases 
  as the ocean transfers heat to the atmosphere (Sun and Trenberth, 1998). <a name="box72"></a></p>

      <p><b>Box 7.2: Changes in natural modes of the climate system.</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>Observed changes in climate over the Northern Hemisphere in winter reveal 
        large warming over the main continental areas and cooling over the North 
        Pacific and North Atlantic. This "cold ocean - warm land" 
        pattern has been shown to be linked to changes in the atmospheric circulation, 
        and, in particular, to the tendency in the past few decades for the North 
        Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) to be in its positive phase. Similarly, the 
        Pacific-North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern has been in a positive 
        phase in association with a negative Southern Oscillation index or, equivalently, 
        the tendency for El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to prefer 
        the warm El Ni&ntilde;o phase following the 1976 climate shift (Chapter 
        2). Because of the differing heat capacities of land and ocean, the "cold 
        ocean-warm land" pattern has amplified the Northern Hemisphere warming. 
        A fingerprint of global warming from climate models run with increasing 
        greenhouse gases indicates greater temperature increases over land than 
        over the oceans, mainly from thermodynamic (heat capacity and moisture) 
        effects. This anthropogenic signal is therefore very similar to that observed, 
        although an in-depth analysis of the processes involved shows that the 
        dynamical effects from atmospheric circulation changes are also important. 
        In other words, the detection of the anthropogenic signal is potentially 
        masked or modified by the nature of the observed circulation changes, 
        at least in the northern winter season. The detection question can be 
        better resolved if other seasons are also analysed (<a href="439.htm">Chapter 
        12</a>). Attribution of the cause of the observed changes requires improved 
        understanding of the origin of the changes in atmospheric circulation. 
        In particular, are the observed changes in ENSO and the NAO (and other 
        modes) perhaps a consequence of global warming itself? <br>
      </p>
      <p> There is no simple answer to this question at present. Because the natural 
        response of the atmosphere to warming (or indeed to any forcing) is to 
        change large-scale waves, some regions will warm while others cool more 
        than the hemispheric average, and counterintuitive changes can be experienced 
        locally. Indeed, there are preferred modes of behaviour of the atmospheric 
        circulation, sometimes manifested as preferred teleconnection patterns 
        (see this chapter) that arise from the planetary waves in the atmosphere 
        and the distribution of land, high topography, and ocean. Often these 
        modes are demonstrably natural modes of either the atmosphere alone or 
        the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. As such, it is also natural for modest 
        changes in atmospheric forcing to project onto changes in these modes, 
        through changes in their frequency and preferred sign, and the evidence 
        suggests that changes can occur fairly abruptly. This is consistent with 
        known behaviour of non-linear systems, where a slow change in forcing 
        or internal mechanisms may not evoke much change in behaviour until some 
        threshold is crossed at which time an abrupt switch occurs. The best known 
        example is the evidence for a series of abrupt climate changes in the 
        palaeoclimate record apparently partly in response to slow changes in 
        sea level and the orbit of the Earth around the Sun (Milankovitch changes, 
        see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>). There is increasing evidence that 
        the observed changes in the NAO may well be, at least in part, a response 
        of the system to observed changes in sea surface temperatures, and there 
        are some indications that the warming of tropical oceans is a key part 
        of this (see this chapter for more detail). ENSO is not simulated well 
        enough in global climate models to have confidence in projected changes 
        with global warming (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>). It is likely that 
        changes in ENSO will occur, but their nature, how large and rapid they 
        will be, and their implications for regional climate change around the 
        world are quite uncertain and vary from model to model (see this chapter 
        and <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>). On time-scales of centuries, the 
        continuing increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may cause the 
        climate system to cross a threshold associated with the Atlantic thermohaline 
        circulation: beyond this threshold a permanent shut-down of the thermohaline 
        circulation results (see this chapter and <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>).<br>
      </p>
      <p> Therefore, climate change may manifest itself both as shifting means 
        as well as changing preference of specific regimes, as evidenced by the 
        observed trend toward positive values for the last 30 years in the NAO 
        index and the climate "shift" in the tropical Pacific about 
        1976. While coupled models simulate features of observed natural climate 
        variability such as the NAO and ENSO, suggesting that many of the relevant 
        processes are included in the models, further progress is needed to depict 
        these natural modes accurately. Moreover, because ENSO and NAO are key 
        determinants of regional climate change, and they can possibly result 
        in abrupt changes, there has been an increase in uncertainty in those 
        aspects of climate change that critically depend on regional changes.

<p> <a name="fig79"></a>The shifts in the location of the organised rainfall in 
  the tropics and the associated latent heat release alters the heating patterns 
  of the atmosphere which forces large-scale waves in the atmosphere. These establish 
  teleconnections, especially the PNA and the southern equivalent, the Pacific 
  South American (PSA) pattern, that extend into mid-latitudes altering the winds 
  and changing the jet stream and storm tracks (Trenberth et al., 1998), with 
  ramifications for weather patterns and societal impacts around the world.</p>
<p> Another related feedback occurs in the sub-tropics. The normally cold waters 
  off the western coasts of continents (such as California and Peru) encourage 
  the development of extensive low stratocumulus cloud decks which block the Sun, 
  and this helps keep the ocean cold. A warming of the waters, such as during 
  El Ni&ntilde;o, eliminates the cloud deck and leads to further sea surface warming 
  through solar radiation. Kitoh et al. (1999) found that this mechanism could 
  lead to interannual variations in the Pacific Ocean without involving equatorial 
  ocean dynamics. Currently, stratocumulus decks are not well simulated in coupled 
  models, resulting in significant deviations of SST from the observed (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>, <a href="315.htm#fig81">Figure 8.1</a>). </p>
<p>Indices of ENSO for the past 120 years (<a href="#fig79">Figure 7.9</a>), indicate 
  that there is considerable variability in the ENSO cycle in the modern record. 
  This variability has been variously attributed to: (i) stochastic forcing due 
  to weather and other high-frequency "noise", and the Madden-Julian 
  intra-seasonal oscillation in particular; (ii) deterministic chaos arising from 
  internal non-linearities of the tropical Pacific ENSO system; (iii) forcing 
  within the climate system but external to the tropical Pacific, and (iv) changes 
  in exogenous forcing (see Neelin et al., 1998 and references therein). Palaeo-proxies, 
  archaeological evidence, and instrumental data (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>) all indicate variations in ENSO behaviour over the past centuries, and 
  throughout the Holocene. Much of this variability appears to be internal to 
  the Earth's climate system, but there is evidence that the rather weak 
  forcing due to orbital variations may be responsible for a systematic change 
  to weaker ENSO cycles in the mid-Holocene (Sandweiss et al., 1996; Clement et 
  al., 1999; Rodbell et al., 1999). However, it appears that the character of 
  ENSO can change on a much faster time-scale than that of small amplitude insolation 
  change imposed by the Earth's varying orbit. The inference to be drawn 
  from observed ENSO variability is that small forcings are able to cause large 
  alterations in the behaviour of this non-linear system.</p>
