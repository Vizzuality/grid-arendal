<h2>6.2 Forcing-Response Relationship</h2>
<h3><a name="621"></a>6.2.1 Characteristics</h3>
<p>As discussed in the SAR, the change in the net irradiance at the tropopause, 
  as defined in <a href="214.htm#611">Section 6.1.1</a>, is, to a first order, 
  a good indicator of the equilibrium global mean (understood to be globally and 
  annually averaged) surface temperature change. The climate sensitivity parameter 
  (global mean surface temperature response <img src="images/delta-l.gif" width="8" height="8">T<sub>s</sub> 
  to the radiative forcing <img src="images/delta-l.gif" width="8" height="8">F) 
  is defined as:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <a name="equ61"></a><img src="images/delta-l.gif" width="8" height="8">T<sub>s</sub> 
    / <img src="images/delta-l.gif" width="8" height="8">F = <img src="images/lamda-s.gif" width="8" height="8"> 
    (6.1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Dickinson, 1982; WMO, 1986; Cess et al., 1993). <a href="#equ61">Equation 
  (6.1</a>) is defined for the transition of the surface-troposphere system from 
  one equilibrium state to another in response to an externally imposed radiative 
  perturbation. In the one-dimensional radiative-convective models, wherein the 
  concept was first initiated, <img src="images/lamda-s.gif" width="8" height="8"> 
  is a nearly invariant parameter (typically, about 0.5 K/(Wm<sup>-2</sup>); Ramanathan 
  et al., 1985) for a variety of radiative forcings, thus introducing the notion 
  of a possible universality of the relationship between forcing and response. 
  It is this feature which has enabled the radiative forcing to be perceived as 
  a useful tool for obtaining first-order estimates of the relative climate impacts 
  of different imposed radiative perturbations. Although the value of the parameter 
  "<img src="images/lamda-s.gif" width="8" height="8">" can vary from 
  one model to another, within each model it is found to be remarkably constant 
  for a wide range of radiative perturbations (WMO, 1986). The invariance of <img src="images/lamda-s.gif" width="8" height="8"> 
  has made the radiative forcing concept appealing as a convenient measure to 
  estimate the global, annual mean surface temperature response, without taking 
  the recourse to actually run and analyse, say, a three-dimensional atmosphere-ocean 
  general circulation model (AOGCM) simulation. </p>
<p>In the context of the three-dimensional AOGCMs, too, the applicability of a 
  general global mean climate sensitivity parameter (i.e., global mean surface 
  temperature response to global mean radiative forcing) has been explored. The 
  GCM investigations include studies of (i) the responses to short-wave forcing 
  such as a change in the solar constant or cloud albedo or doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  both forcing types being approximately spatially homogeneous (e.g., Manabe and 
  Wetherald, 1980; Hansen et al., 1984, 1997a; Chen and Ramaswamy, 1996a; Le Treut 
  et al., 1998), (ii) responses due to different considered mixtures of greenhouse 
  gases, with the forcings again being globally homo-geneous (Wang et al., 1991, 
  1992), (iii) responses to the spatially homogeneous greenhouse gas and the spatially 
  inhomogeneous sulphate aerosol direct forcings (Cox et al., 1995), (iv) responses 
  to different assumed profiles of spatially inhomogeneous species, e.g., aerosols 
  and O<sub>3</sub> (Hansen et al., 1997a), and (v) present-day versus palaeoclimate 
  (e.g., last glacial maximum) simulations (Manabe and Broccoli, 1985; Rind et 
  al., 1989; Berger et al., 1993; Hewitt and Mitchell, 1997).</p>
<p>Overall, the three-dimensional AOGCM experiments performed thus far show that 
  the radiative forcing continues to serve as a good estimator for the global 
  mean surface temperature response but not to a quantitatively rigorous extent 
  as in the case of the one-dimensional radiative-convective models. Several GCM 
  studies suggest a similar global mean climate sensitivity for the spatially 
  homogeneous and for many but not all of the spatially inhomogeneous forcings 
  of relevance for climate change in the industrial era (Wang et al., 1992; Roeckner 
  et al., 1994; Taylor and Penner, 1994; Cox et al., 1995; Hansen et al., 1997a). 
  Paleoclimate simulations (Manabe and Broccoli, 1985; Rind et al., 1989) also 
  suggest the idea of similarities in climate sensitivity for a spatially homogeneous 
  and an inhomogeneous forcing (arising due to the presence of continental ice 
  sheets at mid- to high northern latitudes during the last glacial maximum). 
  However, different values of climate sensitivity can result from the different 
  GCMs which, in turn, are different from the l values obtained with the radiative-convective 
  models. Hansen et al. (1997a) show that the variation in l for most of the globally 
  distributed forcings suspected of influencing climate over the past century 
  is typically within about 20%. Extending considerations to some of the spatially 
  confined forcings yields a range of about 25 to 30% around a central estimate 
  (see also Forster et al., 2001). This is to be contrasted with the variation 
  of 15% obtained in a smaller number of experiments (all with fixed clouds) by 
  Ramaswamy and Chen (1997b). However, in a general sense and considering arbitrary 
  forcing types, the variation in l could be substantially higher (50% or more) 
  and the climate response much more complex (Hansen et al., 1997a). It is noted 
  that the climate sensitivity for some of the forcings that have potentially 
  occurred in the industrial era have yet to be comprehensively investigated.</p>
<p>While the total climate feedback for the spatially homo-geneous and the considered 
  inhomogeneous forcings does not differ significantly, leading to a near-invariant 
  climate sensitivity, the individual feedback mechanisms (water vapour, ice albedo, 
  lapse rate, clouds) can have different strengths (Chen and Ramaswamy, 1996a,b). 
  The feedback effects can be of considerably larger magnitude than the initial 
  forcing and govern the magnitude of the global mean response (Ramanathan, 1981; 
  Wetherald and Manabe, 1988; Hansen et al., 1997a). For different types of perturbations, 
  the relative magnitudes of the feedbacks can vary substantially. </p>
<p>For spatially homogeneous forcings of opposite signs, the responses are somewhat 
  similar in magnitude, although the ice albedo feedback mechanism can yield an 
  asymmetry in the high latitude response with respect to the sign of the forcing 
  (Chen and Ramaswamy, 1996a). Even if the forcings are spatially homo-geneous, 
  there could be changes in land surface energy budgets that depend on the manner 
  of the perturbation (Chen and Ramaswamy, 1996a). Furthermore, for the same global 
  mean forcing, dynamic feedbacks involving changes in convective heating and 
  precipitation can be initiated in the spatially inhomogeneous perturbation cases 
  that differ from those in the spatially homogeneous perturbation cases. </p>
<p>The nature of the response and the forcing-response relation (<a href="#equ61">Equation 
  6.1</a>) could depend critically on the vertical structure of the forcing (see 
  WMO, 1999). A case in point is O<sub>3</sub> changes, since this initiates a 
  vertically inhomogeneous forcing owing to differing characteristics of the solar 
  and long-wave components (WMO, 1992). Another type of forcing is that due to 
  absorbing aerosols in the troposphere (Kondratyev, 1999). In this instance, 
  the surface experiences a deficit while the atmosphere gains short-wave radiative 
  energy. Hansen et al. (1997a) show that, for both these special types of forcing, 
  if the perturbation occurs close to the surface, complex feedbacks involving 
  lapse rate and cloudiness could alter the climate sensitivity substantially 
  from that prevailing for a similar magnitude of perturbation imposed at other 
  altitudes. A different kind of example is illustrated by model experiments indicating 
  that the climate sensitivity is considerably different for O<sub>3</sub> losses 
  occurring in the upper rather than lower stratosphere (Hansen et al., 1997a; 
  Christiansen, 1999). Yet another example is stratospheric aerosols in the aftermath 
  of volcanic eruptions. In this case, the lower stratosphere is radiatively warmed 
  while the surface-troposphere cools (Stenchikov et al., 1998) so that the climate 
  sensitivity parameter does not convey a complete picture of the climatic perturbations. 
  Note that this contrasts with the effects due to CO<sub>2</sub> increases, wherein 
  the surface-troposphere experiences a radiative heating and the stratosphere 
  a cooling. The vertical partitioning of forcing between atmosphere and surface 
  could also affect the manner of changes of parameters other than surface temperature, 
  e.g., evaporation, soil moisture.</p>
<p>Zonal mean and regional scale responses for spatially inhomogeneous forcings 
  can differ considerably from those for homogeneous forcings. Cox et al. (1995) 
  and Taylor and Penner (1994) conclude that the spatially inhomogeneous sulphate 
  aerosol direct forcing in the northern mid-latitudes tends to yield a significant 
  response there that is absent in the spatially homogeneous case. Using a series 
  of idealised perturbations, Ramaswamy and Chen (1997b) show that the gradient 
  of the equator-to-pole surface temperature response to spatially homogeneous 
  and inhomo-geneous forcings is significantly different when scaled with respect 
  to the global mean forcing, indicating that the more spatially confined the 
  forcing, the greater the meridional gradient of the temperature response. In 
  the context of the additive nature of the regional temperature change signature, 
  Penner et al. (1997) suggest that there may be some limit to the magnitude of 
  the forcings that yield a linear signal.</p>
<p>A related issue is whether responses to individual forcings can be linearly 
  added to obtain the total response to the sum of the forcings. Indications from 
  experiments that have attempted a very limited number of combinations are that 
  the forcings can indeed be added (Cox et al., 1995; Roeckner et al., 1994; Taylor 
  and Penner, 1994). These investigations have been carried out in the context 
  of equilibrium simulations and have essentially dealt with the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and sulphate aerosol direct forcing. There tends to be a linear additivity not 
  only for the global mean temperature, but also for the zonal mean temperature 
  and precipitation (Ramaswamy and Chen, 1997a). Haywood et al. (1997c) have extended 
  the study to transient simulations involving greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosol 
  forcings in a GCM. They find the linear additivity to approximately hold for 
  both the surface temperature and precipitation, even on regional scales. Parameters 
  other than surface temperature and precipitation have not been tested extensively. 
  Owing to the limited sets of forcings examined thus far, it is not possible 
  as yet to generalise to all natural and anthropogenic forcings discussed in 
  subsequent sections of this chapter.</p>
<p>One caveat that needs to be reiterated (see IPCC, 1994 and SAR) regarding forcing-response 
  relationships is that, even if there is a cancellation in the global mean forcing 
  due to forcings that are of opposite signs and distributed spatially in a different 
  manner, and even if the responses are linearly additive, there could be spatial 
  aspects of the responses that are not necessarily null. In particular, circulation 
  changes could result in a distinct regional response even under conditions of 
  a null global mean forcing and a null global mean surface temperature response 
  (Ramaswamy and Chen, 1997a). Sinha and Harries (1997) suggest that there can 
  be characteristic vertical responses even if the net radiative forcing is zero.</p>
