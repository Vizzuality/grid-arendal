<h2>1.2 Natural Climate Variations </h2>
<h3><a name="121"></a>1.2.1 Natural Forcing of the Climate System</h3>
<p><i>The Sun and the global energy balance</i><br>
  The ultimate source of energy that drives the climate system is radiation from 
  the Sun. About half of the radiation is in the visible short-wave part of the 
  electromagnetic spectrum. The other half is mostly in the near-infrared part, 
  with some in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Each square metre of the 
  Earth's spherical surface outside the atmosphere receives an average throughout 
  the year of 342 Watts of solar radiation, 31% of which is immediately reflected 
  back into space by clouds, by the atmosphere, and by the Earth's surface. 
  The remaining 235 Wm<sup>-2</sup> is partly absorbed by the atmosphere but most 
  (168 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) warms the Earth's surface: the land and the ocean. 
  The Earth's surface returns that heat to the atmosphere, partly as infrared 
  radiation, partly as sensible heat and as water vapour which releases its heat 
  when it condenses higher up in the atmosphere. This exchange of energy between 
  surface and atmosphere maintains under present conditions a global mean temperature 
  near the surface of 14&deg;C, decreasing rapidly with height and reaching a 
  mean temperature of -58&deg;C at the top of the troposphere.</p>
<p>For a stable climate, a balance is required between incoming solar radiation 
  and the outgoing radiation emitted by the climate system. Therefore the climate 
  system itself must radiate on average 235 Wm<sup>-2</sup> back into space. Details 
  of this energy balance can be seen in <a href="#12">Figure 1.2</a>, which shows 
  on the left hand side what happens with the incoming solar radiation, and on 
  the right hand side how the atmosphere emits the outgoing infrared radiation. 
  Any physical object radiates energy of an amount and at wavelengths typical 
  for the temperature of the object: at higher temperatures more energy is radiated 
  at shorter wavelengths. For the Earth to radiate 235 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, it 
  should radiate at an effective emission temperature of -19&deg;C with typical 
  wavelengths in the infrared part of the spectrum. This is 33&deg;C lower than 
  the average temperature of 14&deg;C at the Earth's surface. To understand 
  why this is so, one must take into account the radiative properties of the atmosphere 
  in the infrared part of the spectrum.</p>

      Of the incoming solar radiation, 49% (168 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) is absorbed by 
      the surface. That heat is returned to the atmosphere as sensible heat, as 
      evapotranspiration (latent heat) and as thermal infrared radiation. Most 
      of this radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere, which in turn emits radiation 
      both up and down. The radiation lost to space comes from cloud tops and 
      atmospheric regions much colder than the surface. This causes a greenhouse 
      effect. Source: Kiehl and Trenberth, 1997: Earth's Annual Global Mean

<p><i><a name="fig12"></a>The natural greenhouse effect</i><br>
  The atmosphere contains several trace gases which absorb and emit infrared radiation. 
  These so-called greenhouse gases absorb infrared radiation, emitted by the Earth's 
  surface, the atmosphere and clouds, except in a transparent part of the spectrum 
  called the "atmospheric window", as shown in <a href="#fig12">Figure 
  1.2</a>. They emit in turn infrared radiation in all directions including downward 
  to the Earth's surface. Thus greenhouse gases trap heat within the atmosphere. 
  This mechanism is called the natural greenhouse effect. The net result is an 
  upward transfer of infrared radiation from warmer levels near the Earth's 
  surface to colder levels at higher altitudes. The infrared radiation is effectively 
  radiated back into space from an altitude with a temperature of, on average, 
  -19&deg;C, in balance with the incoming radiation, whereas the Earth's 
  surface is kept at a much higher temperature of on average 14&deg;C. This effective 
  emission temperature of -19&deg;C corresponds in mid-latitudes with a height 
  of approximately 5 km. Note that it is essential for the greenhouse effect that 
  the temperature of the lower atmosphere is not constant (isothermal) but decreases 
  with height. The natural greenhouse effect is part of the energy balance of 
  the Earth, as can be seen schematically in <a href="#fig12">Figure 1.2</a>.</p>
<p>Clouds also play an important role in the Earth's energy balance and in 
  particular in the natural greenhouse effect. Clouds absorb and emit infrared 
  radiation and thus contribute to warming the Earth's surface, just like 
  the greenhouse gases. On the other hand, most clouds are bright reflectors of 
  solar radiation and tend to cool the climate system. The net average effect 
  of the Earth's cloud cover in the present climate is a slight cooling: 
  the reflection of radiation more than compensates for the greenhouse effect 
  of clouds. However this effect is highly variable, depending on height, type 
  and optical properties of clouds.</p>
<p>This introduction to the global energy balance and the natural greenhouse effect 
  is entirely in terms of the global mean and in radiative terms. However, for 
  a full understanding of the greenhouse effect and of its impact on the climate 
  system, dynamical feedbacks and energy transfer processes should also be taken 
  into account. <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a> presents a more detailed analysis 
  and assessment.</p>
<p><i>Radiative forcing and forcing variability</i><br>
  In an equilibrium climate state the average net radiation at the top of the 
  atmosphere is zero. A change in either the solar radiation or the infrared radiation 
  changes the net radiation. The corresponding imbalance is called "radiative 
  forcing". In practice, for this purpose, the top of the troposphere (the 
  tropopause) is taken as the top of the atmosphere, because the stratosphere 
  adjusts in a matter of months to changes in the radiative balance, whereas the 
  surface-troposphere system adjusts much more slowly, owing principally to the 
  large thermal inertia of the oceans. The radiative forcing of the surface troposphere 
  system is then the change in net irradiance at the tropopause after allowing 
  for stratospheric temperatures to re-adjust to radiative equilibrium, but with 
  surface and tropospheric temperatures and state held fixed at the unperturbed 
  values. A detailed explanation and discussion of the radiative forcing concept 
  may be found in <a href="258.htm">Appendix 6.1</a> to <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>.</p>
<p>External forcings, such as the solar radiation or the large amounts of aerosols 
  ejected by volcanic eruption into the atmosphere, may vary on widely different 
  time-scales, causing natural variations in the radiative forcing. These variations 
  may be negative or positive. In either case the climate system must react to 
  restore the balance. A positive radiative forcing tends to warm the surface 
  on average, whereas a negative radiative forcing tends to cool it. Internal 
  climate processes and feedbacks may also cause variations in the radiative balance 
  by their impact on the reflected solar radiation or emitted infrared radiation, 
  but such variations are not considered part of radiative forcing. <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a> assesses the present knowledge of radiative forcing and its variations, 
  including the anthropogenic change of the atmospheric composition.</p>
