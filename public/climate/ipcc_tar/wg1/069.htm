<i>Documentary evidence</i><br>
<p>Historical documentary data are valuable sources of information about past 
  climate (e.g., Brown and Issar, 1998; Bradley, 1999). However, their use requires 
  great care, as such documents may be biased towards describing only the more 
  extreme events, and are, in certain cases, prone to the use of inconsistent 
  language between different writers and different epochs, and to errors in dating. 
  As for all proxy information, historical documents require careful calibration 
  and verification against modern instrumental data. Two areas particularly strong 
  in historical documents describing climate are Europe and China. In Europe, 
  attempts have been made to extend long climate series back in time using a combination 
  of documentary evidence and fragmentary instrumental records (e.g., Pfister, 
  1995; Pfister et al., 1998). Additional information about past climate change 
  has also been obtained purely from documentary records in Europe (e.g., Martin-Vide 
  and Barriendos, 1995; Br&aacute;zdil, 1996; Pfister et al., 1996, 1998, 1999; 
  Pfister and Br&aacute;zdil, 1999; Rodrigo et al., 1999). In China, regional 
  instrumental temperature series have been extended back over much of the past 
  millennium using documentary data combined with inferences from ice cores and 
  tree rings (Wang et al., 1998a, 1998b; Wang and Gong, 2000).</p>

<i>Mountain glacier moraines</i><br>
  The position of moraines or till left behind by receding glaciers can provide 
  information on the advances (and, less accurately, the retreats) of mountain 
  glaciers. Owing to the complex balance between local changes in melting and 
  ice accumulation, and the effects of topography which influence mountain glaciers 
  (see <a href="064.htm#2254">Section 2.2.5.4</a>), it is difficult to reconstruct 
  regional (as opposed to global) climate changes from the extent of mountain 
  glaciers alone (Oerlemans, 1989). For example, both increased winter precipitation 
  (through greater accumulation) and lower summer temperatures (through decreased 
  melting or "ablation") can lead to more positive glacial mass balances. The 
  inertia of large glaciers dictates that they respond to climate change relatively 
  slowly, with delays of decades or occasionally centuries. For smaller, fast 
  moving glaciers in regions where precipitation and accumulation are moderate, 
  temperature changes are usually the dominant factor influencing mountain glacier 
  masses and lengths. Here glacier moraine evidence in combination with other 
  lines of evidence can provide reliable information on past regional temperature 
  changes (Salinger, 1995; Holzhauser and Zumb&uuml;hl, 1996; Raper et al., 1996; 
  Salinger et al., 1996). 
<h4><a name="2322"></a>2.3.2.2 Multi-proxy synthesis of recent temperature change</h4>
<p>Since the SAR there have been several attempts to combine various types of 
  high-resolution proxy climate indicators to create large-scale palaeoclimate 
  reconstructions that build on earlier work by e.g., Bradley and Jones (1993); 
  Hughes and Diaz (1994) and Mann et al. (1995). Overpeck et al. (1997) and Fisher 
  (1997) have sought to combine information from ice cores, varved lake sediment 
  cores, and tree rings to reconstruct high latitude climate trends for past centuries. 
  Jones et al. (1998) estimated extra-tropical Northern and Southern Hemisphere 
  warm-season temperature changes during the past millennium using a sparse set 
  of extra-tropical warm-season temperature proxy indicators (10 and 8 respectively). 
  Mann et al. (1998) reconstructed global patterns of annual surface temperature 
  several centuries back in time. They calibrated a combined terrestrial (tree 
  ring, ice core and historical documentary indicator) and marine (coral) multi-proxy 
  climate network against dominant patterns of 20th century global surface temperature. 
  Averaging the reconstructed temperature patterns over the far more data-rich 
  Northern Hemisphere half of the global domain, they estimated the Northern Hemisphere 
  mean temperature back to AD 1400, a reconstruction which had significant skill 
  in independent cross-validation tests. Self-consistent estimates were also made 
  of the uncertainties. This work has now been extended back to AD 1000 (<a href="#fig220">Figure 
  2.20</a>, based on Mann et al., 1999). The uncertainties (the shaded region 
  in <a href="#fig220">Figure 2.20</a>) expand considerably in earlier 
  centuries because of the sparse network of proxy data. Taking into account these 
  substantial uncertainties, Mann et al. (1999) concluded that the 1990s were 
  likely to have been the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year, of the past 
  millennium for at least the Northern Hemisphere. Jones et al. (1998) came to 
  a similar conclusion from largely independent data and an entirely independent 
  methodology. Crowley and Lowery (2000) reached the similar conclusion that medieval 
  temperatures were no warmer than mid-20th century temperatures. Borehole data 
  (Pollack et al., 1998) independently support this conclusion for the past 500 
  years although, as discussed earlier (<a href="068.htm#2321">Section 2.3.2.1</a>), 
  detailed interpretations comparison with long-term trends from such of such 
  data are perilous owing to loss of temporal resolution back in time.</p>
  The largely independent multi-proxy Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstructions 
  of Jones et al. (1998) and Mann et al. (1999) are compared in <a href="#fig221">Figure 
  2.21</a>, together with an independent (extra-tropical, warm-season) Northern 
  Hemisphere temperature estimate by Briffa (2000) based on tree-ring density 
  data. The estimated uncertainties shown are those for the smoothed Mann et al. 
  series. Significant differences between the three reconstructions are evident 
  during the 17th and early 19th centuries where either the Briffa et al. or Jones 
  et al. series lie outside the estimated uncertainties in the Mann et al. series. 
  Much of these differences appear to result from the different latitudinal and 
  seasonal emphases of the temperature estimates. This conclusion is supported 
  by the observation that the Mann et al. hemispheric temperature average, when 
  restricted to just the extra-tropical (30 to 70&deg;N band) region of the Northern 
  Hemisphere, shows greater similarity in its trend over the past few centuries 
  to the Jones et al. reconstruction. The differences between these reconstructions 
  emphasise the importance of regional and seasonal variations in climate change. 
  These are discussed in the next section.<br>
