<h4>9.3.6.5 Commentary on changes in extremes of weather and climate</h4>
<p>Although changes in weather and climate extremes are important to society, 
  ecosystems, and wildlife, it is only recently that evidence for changes we have 
  observed to date has been able to be compared to similar changes that we see 
  in model simulations for future climate (generally taken to be the end of the 
  21st century as shown in this chapter). Though several simulations of 20th century 
  climate with various estimates of observed forcings now exist (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>), few of these have been analysed for changes in extremes over the 20th 
  century. So far, virtually all studies of simulated changes in extremes have 
  been performed for future climate. A number of studies are now under way for 
  simulated 20th century climate, but are not yet available for assessment. Additionally, 
  in the 20th century climate integrations there is usually a significant signal/noise 
  problem (especially for changes in phenomena like storms). Therefore, here we 
  assess changes in extremes that have been observed during the 20th century (see 
  <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>), and compare these to simulated changes of 
  extremes for the end of the 21st century from AOGCMs run with increases in greenhouse 
  gases and other constituents. Agreement between the observations and model results 
  would suggest that the changes in extremes we have already observed are qualitatively 
  consistent in a very general way with those changes in climate model simulations 
  of future climate, indicating these changes in extremes would be likely to continue 
  into the future.</p>
<p>The assessment of extremes here relies on very large-scale changes that are 
  physically plausible or representative of changes over many areas. There are 
  some regions where the changes of certain extremes may not agree with the larger-scale 
  changes (see <a href="048.htm">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="373.htm">10</a>). 
  Therefore, the assessment here is a general one where observed and model changes 
  appear to be representative and physically consistent with a majority of changes 
  globally. Additionally, certain changes in observed extremes may not have been 
  specifically itemised from model simulations, but are physically consistent 
  with changes of related extremes in the future climate experiments and are denoted 
  as such. Also note that the information for tropical cyclones is drawn from 
  <a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>, and diurnal temperature range from <a href="439.htm">Chapter 
  12</a>. A further discussion of the synthesis of observed and modelled changes 
  of extremes, along with results on how extremes can affect human society, ecosystems 
  and wildlife, appears in Easterling et al. (2000).</p>
<p>The qualitative consistency between the observations from the latter half of 
  the 20th century and the models for the end of the 21st century in <a href="#tab96">Table 
  9.6</a> suggests that at least some of the changes we have observed to date 
  are likely to be associated with changes in forcing we have already experienced 
  over the 20th century. The implication is that these could continue to increase 
  into the 21st century with the ongoing rise in forcing from ever greater amounts 
  of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>

<p><a href="#tab96">Table 9.6</a> depicts an assessment of confidence in observed 
  changes in extremes of weather and climate during the latter half of the 20th 
  century (left column) and in projected changes during the 21st century (right 
  column). As noted above, this assessment relies on observational and modelling 
  studies, as well as the physical plausibility of future projections across all 
  commonly used scenarios and is based on expert judgement. For more details, 
  see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a> (observations) and <a href="373.htm">Chapter 
  10</a> (regional projections).</p>
<p>For the projected changes in the right-hand column, "very likely" 
  indicates that a number of models have been analysed for such a change, all 
  those analysed show it in most regions, and it is physically plausible. No models 
  have been analysed to show fewer frost days, but it is physically plausible, 
  since most models show an increase in night-time minimum temperatures, which 
  would result in fewer frost days. The category "likely" indicates 
  that theoretical studies and those models analysed show such a change, but only 
  a few current climate models are configured in such a way as to reasonably represent 
  such changes. "Hot days" refers to a day whose maximum temperature 
  reaches or exceeds some temperature that is considered a critical threshold 
  for impacts on human and natural systems. Actual thresholds vary regionally, 
  but typical values include 32&deg;C, 35&deg;C or 40&deg;C.</p>
<p>For some other extreme phenomena, many of which may have important impacts 
  on the environment and society, there is currently insufficient information 
  to assess recent trends, and climate models currently lack the spatial detail 
  required to make confident projections. For example, very small-scale phenomena, 
  such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail and lightning, are not simulated in climate 
  models at present.</p>
