<p><i><a name="fig128"></a></i>We now consider the simulated response to anthropogenic 
  forcing. Models run with increases in greenhouse gases alone give a warming 
  which accelerates in the latter half of the century. When a simple representation 
  of aerosol effects is included (Mitchell et al., 1995b; Cubasch et al., 1996; 
  Haywood et al., 1997; Boer et al., 2000a,b) the rate of warming is reduced (see 
  also <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>, <a href="326.htm#861">Section 8.6.1</a>). 
  The global mean response is similar when additional forcings due to ozone and 
  the indirect effect of sulphates are included. GCM simulations (Tett et al., 
  1996; Hansen et al., 1997b) indicate that changes in stratospheric ozone observed 
  over the last two decades yield a global mean surface temperature cooling of 
  about 0.1 to 0.2&deg;C. This may be too small to be distinguishable from the 
  model's internal variability and is also smaller than the warming effects 
  due to the changes in the well-mixed greenhouse gases over the same time period 
  (about 0.2 to 0.3&deg;C). The lack of a statistically significant surface temperature 
  change is in contrast to the large ozone-induced cooling in the lower stratosphere 
  (WMO, 1999; Bengtsson et al. 1999). </p>
<p><i>The response of the vertical distribution of temperature to anthropogenic 
  forcing</i><br>
  Increases in greenhouse gases lead to a warming of the troposphere and a cooling 
  of the stratosphere due to CO<sub>2</sub> (IPCC, 1996). Reductions in stratospheric 
  ozone lead to a further cooling, particularly in the stratosphere at high latitudes. 
  Anthropogenic sulphate aerosols cool the troposphere with little effect on the 
  stratosphere. When these three forcings are included in a climate model (e.g., 
  Tett et al., 1996, 2000) albeit in a simplified way, the simulated changes show 
  tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling, as observed and as expected 
  on physical principles (<a href="#fig128">Figure 12.8</a>). Note that this structure 
  is distinct from that expected from natural (internal and external) influences. 
</p>
<p><i>The response of surface temperature to anthropogenic forcing</i><br>
  The spatial pattern of the simulated surface temperature response to a steady 
  increase in greenhouse gases is well documented (e.g., Kattenberg et al., 1996; 
  <a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>). The warming is greater over land than over 
  ocean and generally small during the 20th century over the Southern Ocean and 
  northern North Atlantic where mixing extends to considerable depth. The warming 
  is amplified in high latitudes in winter by the recession of sea ice and snow, 
  and is close to zero over sea ice in summer. </p>
<p>Despite the qualitative consistency of these general features, there is considerable 
  variation from model to model. In <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, it was noted 
  that the spatial correlation between the transient response to increasing CO<sub>2</sub> 
  in different models in scenarios to the middle of the 21st century was typically 
  0.65. In contrast, the spatial correlation between the temperature response 
  to greenhouses gases only, and greenhouse gases and aerosols in the same model 
  was typically 0.85 (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="351.htm#tab92">Table 
  9.2</a>). Hence, attempts to detect separate greenhouse gas and aerosol patterns 
  in different models may not give consistent results (see <a href="461.htm">Section 
  12.4.3.2</a>).</p>
