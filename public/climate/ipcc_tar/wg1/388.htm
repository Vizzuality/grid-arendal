<p><a name="fig109"></a>Enhanced resolution improves many aspects of the AGCMs' 
  intra-seasonal variability of circulation at low and intermediate frequencies 
  (Stendel and Roeckner, 1998). However, in some cases values underestimated at 
  standard resolution are overestimated at enhanced resolution (D&egrave;qu&egrave; 
  and Piedelievre, 1995; Stratton, 1999a,b). Martin (1999) found little sensitivity 
  to resolution in either the interannual or intra-seasonal variability of circulation 
  and precipitation of the South Asian monsoon in HadAM3a. Extreme events have 
  not been studied, with the exception of tropical cyclones. This subject cuts 
  across various sections and chapters and thus is dealt with in <a href="#box102">Box 
  10.2</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="1042"></a>10.4.2 Simulations of Climate Change</h3>
<h4><a name="10421"></a>10.4.2.1 Mean climate</h4>
<p>Climate change simulations using ECHAM3 at T42 and T106 resolutions predicted 
  substantially different responses for southern Europe (Cubash et al., 1996). 
  For example, surface temperature response of less than +2&ordm;C in summer at 
  T42 increased by over 4&ordm;C for much of the region at T106 and winter precipitation 
  increased more at T106 than at T42. An important factor in generating the different 
  responses was the substantial difference in the control simulations. Wild et 
  al. (1997) showed a large positive summer surface temperature bias in the T106 
  control derived from a positive feedback between excessive surface insolation 
  and summer dryness. This mechanism provided a large increase in the insolation, 
  and thus the surface temperature, in the anomaly experiment. As this process 
  was handled poorly in the control simulation, little confidence can be placed 
  in the warming amplification simulated at T106.</p>
<p>A variable grid AGCM climate change experiment using the ARPEGE model and sea 
  surface forcing from HadCM2 predicted moderate warmings over Europe, 1.5&ordm;C 
  (northern) to 2.5&ordm;C (southern) in winter and 1&ordm;C to 3.5&ordm;C in 
  summer (D&egrave;qu&egrave; et al., 1998). In contrast, HadCM2 predicted greater 
  warming and a larger north-south gradient in winter (<a href="#fig109">Figure 
  10.9</a>). These differences result mainly from the ARPEGE large-scale flow 
  being too zonal and too strong over mainland Europe, which enhances the moderating 
  influence of the SSTs. The precipitation responses are more similar, especially 
  in summer, when both models predict a decrease over most of Europe, maximum 
  -30% in the south. Differences in the control simulations suggest that 
  little confidence should be placed in this result.</p>
<p>In a similar experiment, HadAM3a at 1.25&deg;30.83&deg; resolution used observed 
  sea surface forcing and anomalies from a HadCM3 GHG simulation and produced 
  a response at the largest scales in the annual mean similar to the AOGCM (Johns, 
  1999). However, regionally or seasonally, many differences were evident in the 
  two models, notably in land sea contrasts, monsoon precipitation and some circulation 
  features. Over Europe, large-scale responses in surface temperature and precipitation 
  were similar except for a larger winter surface warming in northern Europe in 
  HadCM3. This was due to a greater melting back of Arctic sea ice which was too 
  extensive in the HadCM3 control (Jones, 1999). In a 30-year ECHAM4 T106 experiment 
  driven by ECHAM4/OPYC simulations for 1970 to 1999 and 2060 to 2089, the simulations 
  of future climate were more similar to each other than those for the present 
  day (May, 1999). This implies that the differences in the control simulations 
  would determine a proportion of the difference in the responses. In these cases 
  better control simulations at high resolution increase the confidence in their 
  responses.</p>
<h4><a name="10422"></a>10.4.2.2 Climate variability and extreme events</h4>
<p>Due to the limited number and length of simulations and a lack of comprehensive 
  analyses, this subject has been almost completely ignored. The only response 
  in variability or extremes that has received any attention is that of tropical 
  cyclones (<a href="#box102">Box 10.2</a>).</p>

        climates</b> </div>
      <p><i>Simulating a climatology of tropical cyclones</i><br>
        Tropical cyclones can have devastating human and economic impacts (e.g., 
        Pielke and Landsea, 1998) and therefore accurate estimates of future changes 
        in their frequency, intensity and location would be of great value. However, 
        because of their relatively small extent (in global modelling terms) and 
        intense nature, detailed simulation of tropical cyclones for this purpose 
        is difficult. Atmospheric GCMs can simulate tropical cyclone-like disturbances 
        which increase in realism at higher resolution though the intense central 
        core is not resolved (e.g., Bengtsson et al., 1995; McDonald, 1999). Further 
        increases of resolution, by the use of RCMs, provide greater realism (e.g., 
        Walsh and Watterson, 1997) with a very high resolution regional hurricane 
        prediction model giving a reasonable simulation of the magnitude and location 
        of maximum surface wind intensities for the north-west Pacific basin (Knutson 
        et al., 1998). GCMs generally provide realistic simulation of the location 
        and frequency of tropical cyclones (e.g., Tsutsui and Kasahara, 1996; 
        Yoshimura et al., 1999). See also <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a> for 
        more details on tropical cyclones in GCMs.</p>
      <p><i>Tropical cyclones in a warmer climate</i><br>
        Much effort has gone into obtaining and analysing good statistics on tropical 
        cyclones in the recent past. The main conclusion is that there is large 
        decadal variability in the frequency and no significant trend during the 
        last century. One study looking at the century time-scale has shown an 
        increase in the frequency of North Atlantic cyclones from 1851 to 1890 
        and 1951 to 1990 (Fernandez-Partagas and Diaz, 1996). See <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
        2</a> for more details on observed tropical cyclones.</p>
      <p>Most assessments of changes in tropical cyclone behaviour in a future 
        climate have been derived from GCM or RCM studies of the climate response 
        to anthropogenically-derived atmospheric forcings (e.g., Bengtsson et 
        al., 1996, 1997; Walsh and Katzfey, 2000). Recently, more focused approaches 
        have been used: nesting a hurricane prediction model in a GCM climate 
        change simulation (Knutson et al., 1998); inserting idealised tropical 
        cyclones into an RCM climate change simulation (Walsh and Ryan, 2000).</p>
      <p>In an early use of a high-resolution AGCM, a T106 ECHAM3 experiment simulated 
        a decrease in tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere and a reduction 
        of 50% in the Southern Hemisphere (Bengtsson et al., 1996, 1997). However, 
        the different hemispheric responses raised questions about the model's 
        ability to properly represent tropical cyclones and methodological concerns 
        about the experimental design were raised (Landsea, 1997). In a similar 
        experiment, the JMA model also simulated fewer tropical cyclone-like vortices 
        in both hemispheres (Yoshimura et al., 1999). Other GCM studies have shown 
        consistent basin-dependent changes in tropical cyclone formation under 
        2xCO<sub>2</sub> conditions (Royer et al., 1998; Tsutsui et al., 1999). 
        Frequencies increased in the north-west Pacific, decreased in the North 
        Atlantic, and changed little in the south-west Pacific. A high resolution 
        HadAM3a simulation reproduced the latter changes, giving changes in timing 
        in the north-west Pacific and increases in frequency in the north-east 
        Pacific and the north Indian basin (McDonald, 1999). Some GCM studies 
        show increases in tropical storm intensity in a warmer climate (Krishnamurti 
        et al., 1998) though these results can probably not be extrapolated to 
        tropical cyclones as the horizontal resolution of these models is insufficient 
        to resolve the cyclone eye. The likely mean response of tropical Pacific 
        sea surface warming having an El Ni&ntilde;o-like structure suggests that 
        the pattern of tropical cyclone frequency may become more like that observed 
        in El Ni&ntilde;o years (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
      <p>An indication of the likely changes in maximum intensity of cyclones 
        will be better provided by models able to simulate realistic tropical 
        cyclone intensities. A sample of GCM-generated tropical cyclone cases 
        nested in a hurricane prediction model gave increases in maximum intensity 
        (of wind speed) of 5 to 11% in strong cyclones over the north-west Pacific 
        for a 2.2&deg;C SST warming (Knutson and Tuleya, 1999). The RCM study 
        of idealised tropical cyclones (in the South Pacific) showed a small, 
        but not statistically significant, increase in maximum intensity (Walsh 
        and Ryan, 2000). These results are supported by the theory of the maximum 
        potential intensity (MPI) of hurricanes (Emanuel, 1987). A calculation 
        using the MPI framework of Holland (1997) suggested increases of 10 to 
        20% for a 2xCO<sub>2</sub> climate (Henderson-Sellers et al., 1998). This study also 
        acknowledges physical omissions that would reduce this estimate though 
        Emanuel (2000) suggests there is a linear relationship betweeen MPI and 
        the wind speed of real events. Published modelling studies to date neglect 
        the possible feedback of sea surface cooling induced by the cyclone. However, 
        a recently submitted study using a hurricane model with ocean coupling 
        indicates that the increased maximum intensity by CO<sub>2</sub> warming 
        would still occur even when the sea surface cooling feedback is included 
        (Knutson et al., 2000).</p>
      <p>The extreme precipitation associated with tropical cyclones can also 
        be very damaging. The very high resolution studies discussed above suggest 
        that increases in the intensity of tropical cyclones will be accompanied 
        by increases in mean and maximum precipitation rates. In the cases studied, 
        precipitation in the vicinity of the storm centre increased by 20% whereas 
        peak rates increased by 30%. Part of these increases may be due to the 
        increased moisture-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere but nevertheless 
        point to substantially increasing destructive capacity of tropical cyclones 
        in a warmer climate.</p>
      <p><i>In conclusion, there is some evidence that regional frequencies of 
        tropical cyclones may change but none that their locations will change. 
        There is also evidence that the peak intensity may increase by 5% to 10% 
        and precipitation rates may increase by 20% to 30%. There is a need for 
        much more work in this area to provide more robust results.</i></p>

<h3><a name="1043"></a>10.4.3 Summary and Recommendations </h3>
<p>Since the SAR, several variable and high-resolution GCMs have been used to 
  provide high-resolution simulations of climate change. Clearly the technique 
  is still in its infancy with only a few modelling studies carried out and for 
  only a limited number of regions. Also, there is little in-depth analysis of 
  the performance of the models and only preliminary conclusions can be drawn.</p>
<p>Many aspects of the models' dynamics and large-scale flow are improved 
  at higher resolution, though this is not uniformly so geographically or across 
  models. Some models also demonstrate improvements in their surface climatologies 
  at higher resolution. However, substantial underlying errors are often still 
  present in high-resolution versions of current AGCMs. In addition, the direct 
  use of high-resolution versions of current AGCMs, without some allowance of 
  the dependence of models physical parametrizations on resolution, leads to some 
  deterioration in the performance of the models.</p>
<p>Regional responses currently appear more sensitive to the AGCM than the SST 
  forcing used. This result is partially due to some of the model responses being 
  dependent on their control simulations and systematic errors within them. These 
  factors and the small number of studies carried out imply that little confidence 
  can be attached to any of the regional projections provided by high and variable 
  resolution AGCM simulations. The improvements seen with this technique are encouraging, 
  but more effort should be put in analysing, and possibly improving the performance 
  of current models at high resolution. This is particularly important in view 
  of the fact that future AOGCMs will likely use models approaching the resolution 
  considered here in the next 5 to 10 years.</p>
