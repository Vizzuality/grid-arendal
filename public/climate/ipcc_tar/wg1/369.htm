<h4>9.3.6.6 Conclusions</h4>
<p>Much of what climate model studies show could happen to weather and climate 
  extremes in a future climate with increased greenhouse gases is what we would 
  intuitively expect from our understanding of how the climate system works. For 
  example, a warming of the surface supplies more water vapour to the atmosphere, 
  which is a greater source of moisture in storms and thus we would expect an 
  increase in intense precipitation and more rainfall from a given rainfall event, 
  both results seen in climate model simulations. There are competing effects 
  of decreased baroclinicity in some regions due to greater surface warming at 
  high latitudes, and increasing mid-tropospheric baroclinicity due to greater 
  mid-tropospheric low latitude warming (Kushner et al., 2001). Additionally, 
  a number of changes in weather and climate extremes from climate models have 
  been seen in observations in various parts of the world (decreased diurnal temperature 
  range, warmer mean temperatures associated with increased extreme warm days 
  and decreased extreme cold days, increased rainfall intensity, etc.). Though 
  the climate models can simulate many aspects of climate variability and extremes, 
  they are still characterised by systematic simulation errors and limitations 
  in accurately simulating regional climate such that appropriate caveats must 
  accompany any discussion of future changes in weather and climate extremes.</p>
<p>Recent studies have reproduced previous results in the SAR and this gives us 
  increased confidence in their credibility (although agreement between models 
  does not guarantee that those changes will occur in the real climate system): 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>An increase in mean temperatures leads to more frequent extreme high temperatures 
    and less frequent extreme low temperatures. </li>
  <li>Night-time low temperatures in many regions increase more than daytime highs, 
    thus reducing the diurnal temperature range. </li>
  <li>Decreased daily variability of temperature in winter and increased variability 
    in summer in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude areas.</li>
  <li>There is a general drying of the mid-continental areas during summer in 
    terms of decreases in soil moisture, and this is ascribed to a combination 
    of increased temperature and potential evaporation not being balanced by precipitation.</li>
  <li>Intensity of precipitation events increases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional results since 1995 include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Changes in temperature extremes noted above have been related to an increase 
    in a heat index (leading to increased discomfort and stress on the human body), 
    an increase in cooling degree days and a decrease in heating degree days. 
  </li>
  <li>Additional statistics relating to extremes are now being produced. For example, 
    in one model the greatest increase in the 20-year return values of daily maximum 
    temperature is found in central and Southeast North America, central and Southeast 
    Asia and tropical Africa where there is a decrease in soil moisture content, 
    and also over the dry surface of North Africa. The west coast of North America 
    is affected by increased precipitation, resulting in moister soil and more 
    moderate increases in extreme temperature. The increases in the return values 
    of daily minimum temperature are larger than those of daily maximum temperature 
    mainly over land areas and where snow and sea ice retreat. </li>
  <li>Precipitation extremes increase more than the mean and that means a decrease 
    in return period for the extreme precipitation events almost everywhere (e.g., 
    20 to 10 years over North America). </li>
</ul>
<p>Aspects which have been addressed but remain unresolved at this time include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no general agreement yet among models concerning future changes 
    in mid-latitude storms (intensity, frequency and variability), though there 
    are now a number of studies that have looked at such possible changes and 
    some show fewer weak but greater numbers of deeper mid-latitude lows, meaning 
    a reduced total number of cyclones.</li>
  <li>Due to the limitations of spatial resolution in current AOGCMs, climate 
    models do not provide any direct information at present regarding lightning, 
    hail, and tornadoes. Results derived from earlier models used empirical relationships 
    to infer a possible future increase in lightning and hail, though there have 
    been no recent studies to corroborate those results.</li>
  <li>There is some evidence that shows only small changes in the frequency of 
    tropical cyclones derived from large-scale parameters related to tropical 
    cyclone genesis, though some measures of intensities show increases, and some 
    theoretical and modelling studies suggest that upper limit intensities could 
    increase.</li>
</ul>
