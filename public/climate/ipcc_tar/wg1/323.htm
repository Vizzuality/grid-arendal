<h4>8.5.4.3 Does uncertainty in land surface models contribute to uncertainties 
  in climate prediction?</h4>
<p>Uncertainty in climate simulations resulting from the land surface has traditionally 
  been deduced from offline experiments (see <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a> and 
  <a href="322.htm#8542">Section 8.5.4.2</a>) due to difficulties associated with 
  comparing land-surface schemes when forced by different climate models (e.g., 
  Polcher et al., 1998b). Some work since the SAR has focused on the sensitivity 
  of land-surface schemes to uncertainties in parameters (e.g., Milly, 1997) and 
  on whether different land-surface schemes, coupled to climate models, lead to 
  different climate simulations or different sensitivity to increasing CO<sub>2</sub> (Henderson-Sellers 
  et al., 1995).</p>

<p><a name="fig812"></a>Polcher et al. (1998a) used four different climate models, 
  each coupled to two different land-surface schemes to explore the role of the 
  land surface under 1xCO<sub>2</sub> and 2xCO<sub>2</sub>. The modification to the land-surface scheme 
  tended to focus on aspects of the soil-hydrology and vegetation/soil-moisture 
  interactions (Gedney et al., 2000). To measure the uncertainty associated with 
  surface processes, the variance of anomalies caused by the changes to the surface 
  scheme in the four climate models was computed. The uncertainty in climate models 
  was computed by using the variance of annual anomalies relative to a consensus 
  (the average of all models). This measure takes into account the differences 
  between climate models, as well as the internal variance of the atmosphere. 
  With these two variances, a ratio was constructed to evaluate the relative importance 
  of the uncertainty linked to surface processes in comparison to the uncertainty 
  linked to other aspects of the climate model (Crossley et al., 2000). In <a href="#fig812">Figure 
  8.12a</a> this diagnostic is applied to zonal mean values over land for the 
  1xCO<sub>2</sub> experiments. The highest values, indicating a large contribution of surface 
  processes to the uncertainty, were obtained for evaporation, the variable most 
  affected by surface processes (the asterisk indicates significance at the 95% 
  of this measure). Surface air temperature was strongly dependent on surface 
  processes in the tropics but at high latitudes its uncertainty was dominated 
  by atmospheric processes. In the high latitudes, the hydrological cycle (characterised 
  by precipitation and cloud cover) was partly controlled by the surface as indicated 
  by high values of the ratio. Overall, <a href="#fig812">Figure 8.12</a> shows 
  that the contribution to total uncertainty in the simulation of climate resulting 
  from the land surface may be large and varies geographically.</p>
<p><a href="#fig812">Figure 8.12b</a> displays the same diagnostic but for the 
  anomalies resulting from a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>. The maximum uncertainty is concentrated 
  in the tropics and the variables most affected are cloud cover and temperature. 
  The uncertainty in evaporation changes is large but does not dominate as in 
  the control climate. In the Northern Hemisphere a secondary peak was found for 
  cloud cover and to some extent for precipitation, indicating that a significant 
  part of the uncertainties in the impact of climate change on the hydrological 
  cycle originates from land-surface processes. The shapes of these curves are 
  very different in the two figures, indicating that different processes are responsible 
  for the uncertainties in the control simulation and the climate change anomalies. 
  This implies that the sensitivity of land-surface schemes to climate change 
  needs to be evaluated and that it can not be deduced from results obtained for 
  present day conditions. Gedney et al. (2000) analysed these results regionally 
  and found that the simulations differ markedly in terms of their predicted changes 
  in evapotranspiration and soil moisture. They conclude that uncertainty in the 
  predicted changes in surface hydrology is more dependent on gross features of 
  the runoff versus soil moisture relationship than on the detailed treatment 
  of evapotranspiration. The importance of hydrology was also demonstrated by 
  Ducharne et al. (1998) and Milly (1997).</p>
<p>Other work has involved using global climate fields provided by GCM analyses 
  to force land-surface models offline (see Dirmeyer et al., 1999). In this study, 
  different land-surface models use the same atmospheric forcings, and the same 
  soil and vegetation data sets. Model outputs are compared with regional runoff 
  and soil moisture data sets and, where available, to observations from large-scale 
  field experiments. To date, results highlight the differences between land-surface 
  model treatments of large-scale hydrology and snow processes; it is anticipated 
  that these and other trials will lead to significant improvements in these problem 
  areas in the near future.</p>
<p>Uncertainty in land-surface processes, coupled with uncertainty in parameter 
  data combines, at this time, to limit the confidence we have in the simulated 
  regional impacts of increasing CO<sub>2</sub>. In general, the evidence suggests that the 
  uncertainty is largely restricted to surface quantities (i.e., the large-scale 
  climate changes simulated by coupled climate models are probably relatively 
  insensitive to land-surface processes). Our uncertainty derives from difficulties 
  in the modelling of snow, evapotranspiration and below-ground processes. Overall, 
  at regional scales, and if land-surface quantities are considered (soil moisture, 
  evaporation, runoff, etc.), uncertainties in our understanding and simulation 
  of land-surface processes limit the reliability of predicted changes in surface 
  quantities.</p>
