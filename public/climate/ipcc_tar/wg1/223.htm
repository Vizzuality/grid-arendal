<h2>6.4 Stratospheric Ozone</h2>
<h3><a name="641"></a>6.4.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>The observed stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> losses over the past two decades have 
  caused a negative forcing of the surface-troposphere system (IPCC, 1992, 1994; 
  SAR). In general, the sign and magnitude of the forcing due to stratospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub> loss are governed by the vertical profile of the O<sub>3</sub> 
  loss from the lower through to the upper stratosphere (WMO, 1999). Ozone depletion 
  in the lower stratosphere, which occurs mainly in the mid- to high latitudes 
  is the principal component of the forcing. It causes an increase in the solar 
  forcing of the surface-troposphere system. However, the long-wave effects consist 
  of a reduction of the emission from the stratosphere to the troposphere. This 
  comes about due to the O<sub>3</sub> loss, coupled with a cooling of the stratospheric 
  temperatures in the stratospheric adjustment process, with a colder stratosphere 
  emitting less radiation. The long-wave effects, after adjustment of the stratospheric 
  temperatures to the imposed perturbation, overwhelm the solar effect i.e., the 
  negative long-wave forcing prevails over the positive solar to lead to a net 
  negative radiative forcing of the surface-troposphere system (IPCC, 1992). The 
  magnitude of the forcing is dependent on the loss in the lower stratosphere, 
  with the estimates subject to some uncertainties in view of the fact that detailed 
  observations on the vertical profile in this region of the atmosphere are difficult 
  to obtain.</p>
<p>Typically, model-based estimates involve a local (i.e., over the grid box of 
  the model) adjustment of the stratosphere (<a href="214.htm">Section 6.1</a>) 
  assuming the dynamical heating to be fixed (FDH approximation; see also <a href="258.htm">Appendix 
  6.1</a>). An improved version of this scheme is the so-called seasonally evolving 
  fixed dynamical heating (SEFDH; Forster et al., 1997; Kiehl et al., 1999). The 
  adjustment of the stratosphere to a new thermal equilibrium state is a critical 
  element for estimating the sign and magnitude of the forcing due to stratospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub> loss (WMO, 1992, 1995). While the computational procedures are 
  well established for the FDH and SEFDH approximations in the context of the 
  surface-troposphere forcing, one test of the approximations lies in the comparison 
  of the computed with observed temperature changes, since it is this factor that 
  plays a large role in the estimate of the forcing. While the temperature changes 
  going into the determination of the forcing are broadly consistent with the 
  observations, there are challenges in comparing quantitatively the actual temperature 
  changes (which undoubtedly are affected by other influences and may even contain 
  feedbacks due to O<sub>3</sub> and other forcings) with the FDH or SEFDH model 
  simulations (which necessarily do not contain feedback effects other than the 
  strato-spheric temperature response due to the essentially radiative adjustment 
  process).</p>
<p>We reiterate both the concept of the forcing for stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  changes and the fact that this has led to a negative radiative forcing since 
  the late 1970s. Further, the model-based estimates that necessarily rely on 
  satellite observations of O<sub>3</sub> losses are likely the most reliable 
  means to derive the forcing, notwithstanding the uncertainty in the vertical 
  profile of loss in the vicinity of the tropopause. Since several model estimates 
  have employed the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) observations as one 
  of the inputs for the calculations, there is the likelihood of a small tropospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub> change component contaminating the stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  loss amounts, especially for the lowermost regions of the lower stratosphere 
  (Hansen et al., 1997a; Shine and Forster, 1999). Both the estimates derived 
  in the earlier IPCC assessments and the studies since the SAR show that the 
  forcing pattern increases from the mid- to high latitudes consistent with the 
  O<sub>3</sub> loss amounts. Seasonally, the winter/springtime forcings are the 
  largest, again consistent with the temporal nature of the observed O<sub>3</sub> 
  depletion.</p>
<p>It is logical to enquire into the realism of the computed coolings with the 
  available observations using models more realistic than FDH/SEFDH, namely GCMs. 
  Furthermore, comparison of the FDH and SEFDH derived temperature changes with 
  those from a GCM constitutes another test of the approximations. WMO (1999) 
  concluded, on the basis of intercomparisons of the temperature records as measured 
  by different instruments, that there has been a distinct cooling of the global 
  mean temperature of the lower stratosphere over the past two decades, with a 
  value of about 0.5&deg;C/decade. Model simulations from GCMs using the observed 
  O<sub>3</sub> losses yield global mean temperature changes that are approximately 
  consistent with the observations. Such a cooling is also much larger than that 
  due to the well-mixed greenhouse gases taken together over the same time period. 
  Although the possibility of other trace species also contributing to this cooling 
  cannot be ruled out, the consistency between observations and model simulations 
  enhances the general principle of an O<sub>3</sub>-induced cooling of the lower 
  stratosphere, and thus the negativity of the radiative forcing due to the O<sub>3</sub> 
  loss. Going from global, annual mean to zonal, seasonal mean changes in the 
  lower stratosphere, the agreement between models and observations tends to be 
  less strong than for the global mean values, but the suggestion of an O<sub>3</sub>-induced 
  signal exists. Note though that water vapour changes could also be contributing 
  (see <a href="231.htm">Section 6.6.4</a>; Forster and Shine, 1999), complicating 
  the quantitative attribution of the cooling solely due to O<sub>3</sub>. As 
  far as the FDH models that have been employed to derive the forcing are concerned, 
  their temperature changes are broadly consistent with the GCMs and the observed 
  cooling. However, the mid- to high latitude cooling in FDH tends to be stronger 
  than in the GCMs and is more than that observed. The SEFDH approximation tends 
  to do better than the FDH calculation when compared against observations (Forster 
  et al., 1997).</p>
