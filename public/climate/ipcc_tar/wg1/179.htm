<p> The single scattering albedo wo, which is important in determining the direct 
  radiative effect, is difficult to retrieve from satellites, especially over 
  oceans (Kaufman et al., 1997). This is due to satellites' viewing geometry, 
  which restricts measurements to light scattering rather than extinction for 
  most tropospheric aerosols. Accurate values of wo can be retrieved from satellite 
  data for some special conditions, especially if combined with ground-based data 
  (Fraser and Kaufman, 1985; Nakajima and Higurashi, 1997).<br>
</p>
<p> At this time there are no reliable methods for determining from satellite 
  data the fraction of atmospheric aerosols that are anthropogenic. This is a 
  major limitation in determining the radiative forcing in addition to the overall 
  radiative effect of aerosols (Boucher and Tanr&eacute;, 2000).<br>
</p>
<p> Field campaigns such as the Tropospheric Aerosol Radiative Forcing Observational 
  Experiment (TARFOX), the Aerosol Characterisation Experiment (ACE-1, ACE-2), 
  the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), SCAR-B, and monitoring networks such as 
  AERONET provide essential information about the chemical and physical properties 
  of aerosols (Novakov et al., 1997; Hegg et al., 1997; Hobbs et al., 1997; Ross 
  et al., 1998; Holben et al., 1998). These studies have also shown the importance 
  of mixing and entrainment between the boundary layer and the free troposphere 
  in determining aerosol properties over the oceans (e.g. Bates et al., 1998; 
  Johnson et al., 2000). INDOEX found long-range transport of highly absorbing 
  aerosol. The importance of absorption was shown by a change in irradiance at 
  the surface that was two to three times that at the top of the atmosphere (Satheesh 
  et al., 1999; Podgorny et al., 2000). TARFOX data also show the importance of 
  black carbon in calculating broad-band irradiances, and confirm theoretical 
  calculations that the strongest radiative effect occurred not at noon, but rather 
  when the solar zenith angle was approximately 60 to 70 degrees (Russell et al., 
  1999; Hignett et al., 1999). <br>
</p>
<p> Local closure studies can compare size-resolved aerosol chemistry data with 
  both total mass measurements and light scattering. Both comparisons have been 
  made to within analytical uncertainties of 20 to 40% (Quinn and Coffman, 1998; 
  Neus&uuml;&szlig; et al., 2000; Putaud et al., 2000). Local closure studies 
  have also successfully compared predicted and measured hygroscopic growth (Carrico 
  et al., 1998; Swietlicki et al., 1999). However, achieving closure between measured 
  aerosol properties and observed cloud nucleation is more difficult (Brenguier 
  et al., 2000).<br>
</p>
<p> Column closure studies compare different ways of obtaining a vertically integrated 
  optical property, usually optical depth. Comparisons were made during TARFOX 
  between aerosol optical depths derived from satellites looking down and an aircraft 
  sunphotometer looking up (Veefkind et al., 1998). Optical depths from ATSR-2 
  retrievals were within 0.03 of sunphotometer data and optical depths from AVHRR 
  were systematically lower but highly correlated with sunphotometer data. Except 
  in some dust layers, aerosol optical depths computed during ACE-2 from in situ 
  data, measured from sunphotometers, and retrieved from satellites agreed within 
  about 20% (Collins et al., 2000; Schmid et al., 2000). Optical depths computed 
  from lidar profiles have agreed with sunphotometer measurements within 40% at 
  several sites (Ferrare et al., 1998, 2000; Flamant et al., 2000).<br>
</p>
<p> There is considerable common ground between closure studies (Russell and Heintzenberg, 
  2000). An important uncertainty in both mass closure and hygroscopic growth 
  is often the treatment of organics (e.g. McMurry et al., 1996; Raes et al., 
  2000). The sampling of coarse aerosols is often a limitation in computing scattering 
  from in-situ data (e.g. Ferrare et al., 1998; Quinn and Coffman, 1998). Black 
  carbon and other light absorbing aerosols are difficult to treat because of 
  difficulties both in measuring them (<a href="170.htm">Section 5.2.2.4</a>) 
  and computing their effects (<a href="165.htm">Section 5.1.2</a>). Layers of 
  dust aerosol pose special problems because they combine coarse particles, uncertainties 
  in optical parameters, non-sphericity, and spatial inhomogeneity (Clarke et 
  al., 1996; Russell and Heintzenberg, 2000). For example, averaged discrepancies 
  during ACE-2 for derived and measured scattering coefficients were less than 
  20% except in dust layers, where they were about 40% (Collins et al., 2000). 
  There has been a strong consensus from field studies that surface measurements 
  of aerosol properties are rarely sufficient for computations of column properties 
  such as optical depth. Some common reasons are strong vertical gradients in 
  coarse aerosols and the transport of continental aerosols in the free troposphere 
  above a marine boundary layer.</p>
