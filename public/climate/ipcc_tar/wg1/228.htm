<h3>6.5.3 Future Tropospheric Ozone Forcing</h3>
<p>As noted in Harris et al. (l998) and Oltmans et al. (l998), the observed upward 
  trends in surface O<sub>3</sub> in Europe and North America appear to be less steep in 
  the past decade or two than in earlier periods (e.g., before about l980), perhaps 
  because of control measures designed to reduce emissions of O<sub>3</sub> precursors and 
  mitigate urban pollution problems. Non-linear chemical feedbacks may also contribute 
  to damping the recent past and future trends (Wang and Jacob, l998). Theoretical 
  studies using chemistry/transport models have attempted to prescribe likely 
  future emissions of precursors and predict future tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> abundances. 
  The largest future increases in O<sub>3</sub> forcings may occur in Asia in association 
  with projected population growth and future development (van Dorland et al., 
  l997; Brasseur et al., l998). Chalita et al. (1996) calculated a globally averaged 
  radiative forcing from pre-industrial times to 2050 of 0.43 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. The models 
  of van Dorland et al. (l997) and Brasseur et al. (l998) suggest a higher globally 
  averaged total radiative forcing from pre-industrial times to 2050 of 0.66 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  and 0.63 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, while that of Stevenson et al. (l998) yields a 
  forcing of 0.48 Wm<sup>-2</sup> in 2100. As the analysis presented above shows, these differences 
  are likely to be due to modelled differences in the latitudinal distributions 
  or magnitudes of the projected O<sub>3</sub> change due for example to different emission 
  inventories or model processes such as transport, and much less likely to be 
  due to differences in radiative codes.</p>
<h2><a name="66"></a>6.6 Indirect Forcings due to Chemistry</h2>
<p>In addition to the direct forcings caused by injection of radiatively active 
  gases to the atmosphere, some compounds or processes can also modify the radiative 
  balance through indirect effects relating to chemical transformation or change 
  in the distribution of radiatively active species. As previously indicated (IPCC, 
  1992, 1994; SAR), the tropospheric chemical processes determining the indirect 
  greenhouse effects are highly complex and not fully understood. The uncertainties 
  connected with estimates of the indirect effects are larger than the uncertainties 
  of those connected to estimates of the direct effects. Because of the central 
  role that O<sub>3</sub> and OH play in tropospheric chemistry, the chemistry 
  of CH<sub>4</sub>, CO, NMHC, and NO<sub>x</sub> is strongly 
  intertwined, making the interpretation of the effects associated with emission 
  changes rather complex. It should be noted that indirect effects involving OH 
  feedback on the lifetime of well-mixed greenhouse gases, and tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  concentration changes since the pre-industrial are implicitly accounted for 
  in <a href="218.htm">Sections 6.3</a> and <a href="225.htm">6.5</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="661"></a>6.6.1 Effects of Stratospheric Ozone Changes on Radiatively 
  Active Species</h3>
<p>Increased penetration of ultraviolet radiation into the troposphere as a result 
  of stratospheric ozone depletion leads to changes in the photodissociation rates 
  of some key chemical species. One of the primary species affected by possible 
  changes in photodissociation rates is the hydroxyl radical OH, which regulates 
  the tropospheric lifetime of a large number of trace gases such as CH<sub>4</sub>, 
  CO, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), NO<sub>x</sub>, 
  and to a lesser extent, sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) (see <a href="127.htm">Chapter 
  4</a>). The impact of stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> changes on the fate of tropo-spheric 
  species has been discussed by Ma and van Weele (2000), Fuglestvedt et al. (1994), 
  Bekki et al. (1994); and Fuglestvedt et al. (1995); on the basis of two-dimensional 
  model simulations, and by Madronich and Granier (1994), Granier et al. (1996), 
  Van Dop and Krol (1996) and Krol et al. (1998) using three-dimensional models. 
  These studies and the updated calculations presented by WMO (1999) estimated 
  that a 1% decrease in global total O<sub>3</sub> leads to a global increase 
  in O<sub>3</sub> photolysis rate of 1.4%, resulting in a 0.7 to 0.8% increase 
  in global OH. Changes in photolysis rates from reduced stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  also have the potential to alter tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> production and destruction 
  rates. Based on stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> evolution over the period 1980 to 
  1996, Myhre et al. (2000) have calculated a reduction in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  associated with increased ultra-violet penetration and a corresponding negative 
  radiative forcing reaching -0.01 Wm<sup>-2</sup> over that period of time. Another 
  indirect impact of stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> depletion on climate forcing 
  has been proposed by Toumi et al. (1994, 1995). The hydroxyl radical oxidises 
  SO<sub>2</sub> to gaseous sulphuric acid, which is a source of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> 
  particles. Changes in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> formation resulting from OH 
  changes might affect the number of particles which act as condensation nuclei. 
  Rodhe and Crutzen (1995) challenged whether this mechanism was of importance.</p>
