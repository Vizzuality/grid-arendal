<h2>12.2 The Elements of Detection and Attribution </h2>

      <b>Figure 12.1:</b> Global mean surface air temperature anomalies from 1,000-year 
      control simulations with three different climate models, HadCM2, GFDL R15 
      and ECHAM3/LSG (labelled HAM3L), compared to the recent instrumental record 
      (Stouffer et al., 2000). No model control simulation shows a trend in surface 
      air temperature as large as the observed trend. If internal variability 
      is correct in these models, the recent warming is likely not due to variability 
      produced within the climate system alone. </td>

<p><a name="fig121"></a>Ideally, a detection and attribution study requires long 
  records of observed data for climate elements that have the potential to show 
  large climate change signals relative to natural variability. It is also necessary 
  that the observing system has sufficient coverage so that the main features 
  of natural variability and climate change can be identified and monitored. A 
  thorough assessment of observed climate change, climate variability and data 
  quality was presented in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>. Most detection and 
  attribution studies have used near-surface air temperature, sea surface temperature 
  or upper air temperature data, as these best fit the requirement above. </p>
<p>The quality of observed data is a vital factor. Homogeneous data series are 
  required with careful adjustments to account for changes in observing system 
  technologies and observing practices. Estimates of observed data uncertainties 
  due to instrument errors or variations in data coverage (assessed in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>) are included in some recent detection and attribution studies. </p>
<p>There have been five more years of observations since the SAR. Improvements 
  in historical data coverage and processing are described in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>. Confidence limits for observational sampling error have been estimated 
  for the global and hemispheric mean temperature record. Applications of improved 
  pre-instrumental proxy data reconstructions are described in the next two sections.</p>
<h3><a name="1222"></a>12.2.2 Internal Climate Variability</h3>
<p>Detection and attribution of climate change is a statistical "signal-in-noise" 
  problem, it requires an accurate knowledge of the properties of the "noise". 
  Ideally, internal climate variability would be estimated from instrumental observations, 
  but a number of problems make this difficult. The instrumental record is short 
  relative to the 30 to 50 year time-scales that are of interest for detection 
  and attribution of climate change, particularly for variables in the free atmosphere. 
  The longest records that are available are those for surface air temperature 
  and sea surface temperature. Relatively long records are also available for 
  precipitation and surface pressure, but coverage is incomplete and varies in 
  time (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>). The instrumental record also contains 
  the influences of external anthropogenic and natural forcing. A record of natural 
  internal variability can be reconstructed by removing estimates of the response 
  to external forcing (for example, Jones and Hegerl, 1998; Wigley et al., 1998a). 
  However, the accuracy of this record is limited by incomplete knowledge of the 
  forcings and by the accuracy of the climate model used to estimate the response.</p>
<p><i>Estimates using palaeoclimatic data</i><br>
  Palaeo-reconstructions provide an additional source of information on climate 
  variability that strengthens our qualitative assessment of recent climate change. 
  There has been considerable progress in the reconstruction of past temperatures. 
  New reconstructions with annual or seasonal resolution, back to 1000 AD, and 
  some spatial resolution have become available (Briffa et al., 1998; Jones et 
  al., 1998; Mann et al., 1998, 2000; Briffa et al., 2000; Crowley and Lowery, 
  2000; see also <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="069.htm#fig221">Figure 2.21</a>). However, a number 
  of difficulties, including limited coverage, temporal inhomogeneity, possible 
  biases due to the palaeo-reconstruction process, uncertainty regarding the strength 
  of the relationships between climatic and proxy indices, and the likely but 
  unknown influence of external forcings inhibit the estimation of internal climate 
  variability directly from palaeo-climate data. We expect, however, that the 
  reconstructions will continue to improve and that palaeo-data will become increasingly 
  important for assessing natural variability of the climate system. One of the 
  most important applications of this palaeo-climate data is as a check on the 
  estimates of internal variability from coupled climate models, to ensure that 
  the latter are not underestimating the level of internal variability on 50 to 
  100 year time-scales (see below). The limitations of the instrumental and palaeo-records 
  leave few alternatives to using long "control" simulations with coupled 
  models (see <a href="#fig121">Figure 12.1</a>) to estimate the detailed structure 
  of internal climate variability.</p>
