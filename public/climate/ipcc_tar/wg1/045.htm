<h3><a name="132"></a>1.3.2 Modelling and Projection of Anthropogenic Climate 
  Change </h3>
<p><i>Climate models</i><br>
  The behaviour of the climate system, its components and their interactions, 
  can be studied and simulated using tools known as climate models. These are 
  designed mainly for studying climate processes and natural climate variability, 
  and for projecting the response of the climate to human-induced forcing. Each 
  component or coupled combination of components of the climate system can be 
  represented by models of varying complexity.</p>
<p>The nucleus of the most complex atmosphere and ocean models, called General 
  Circulation Models (Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs) and Ocean 
  General Circulation Models (OGCMs)) is based upon physical laws describing the 
  dynamics of atmosphere and ocean, expressed by mathematical equations. Since 
  these equations are non-linear, they need to be solved numerically by means 
  of well-established mathematical techniques. Current atmosphere models are solved 
  spatially on a three-dimensional grid of points on the globe with a horizontal 
  resolution typically of 250 km and some 10 to 30 levels in the vertical. A typical 
  ocean model has a horizontal resolution of 125 to 250 km and a resolution of 
  200 to 400 m in the vertical. Their time-dependent behaviour is computed by 
  taking time steps typically of 30 minutes. The impact of the spatial resolution 
  on the model simulations is discussed in <a href="335.htm">Section 8.9</a> of 
  <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
<p>Models of the various components of the climate system may be coupled to produce 
  increasingly complex models. The historical development of such coupled climate 
  models is shown in <a href="021.htm#box3">Box 3</a> of the <a href="010.htm">Technical 
  Summary</a>. Processes taking place on spatial and temporal scales smaller than 
  the model's resolution, such as individual clouds or convection in atmosphere 
  models, or heat transport through boundary currents or mesoscale eddies in ocean 
  models, are included through a parametric representation in terms of the resolved 
  basic quantities of the model. Coupled atmosphere-ocean models, including such 
  parametrized physical processes, are called Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation 
  Models (AOGCMs). They are combined with mathematical representations of other 
  components of the climate system, sometimes based on empirical relations, such 
  as the land surface and the cryosphere. The most recent models may include representations 
  of aerosol processes and the carbon cycle, and in the near future perhaps also 
  the atmospheric chemistry. The development of these very complex coupled models 
  goes hand in hand with the availability of ever larger and faster computers 
  to run the models. Climate simulations require the largest, most capable computers 
  available.</p>
<p>A realistic representation of the coupling between the various components of 
  the climate system is essential. In particular the coupling between the atmosphere 
  and the oceans is of central importance. The oceans have a huge heat capacity 
  and a decisive influence on the hydrological cycle of the climate system, and 
  store and exchange large quantities of carbon dioxide. To a large degree the 
  coupling between oceans and atmosphere determines the energy budget of the climate 
  system. There have been difficulties modelling this coupling with enough accuracy 
  to prevent the model climate unrealistically drifting away from the observed 
  climate. Such climate drift may be avoided by adding an artificial correction 
  to the coupling, the so-called "flux adjustment". The evaluation in 
  <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a> of recent model results identifies improvements 
  since the SAR, to the point that there is a reduced reliance on such corrections, 
  with some recent models operating with minimal or no adjustment.</p>
<p>For various reasons, discussed in <a href="313.htm">Section 8.3</a> of <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>, it is important to also develop and use simpler models than the fully 
  coupled comprehensive AOGCMs, for example to study only one or a specific combination 
  of components of the climate system or even single processes, or to study many 
  different alternatives, which is not possible or is impractical with comprehensive 
  models. In IPCC (1997) a hierarchy of models used in the IPCC assessment process 
  was identified and described, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial 
  dimensions, the extent to which physical processes are explicitly represented, 
  the level to which empirical parametrization is involved, and the computational 
  costs of running the models. In the IPCC context, simple models are also used 
  to compute the consequences of greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Such models 
  are tuned to the AOGCMs to give similar results when globally averaged.</p>
<p><i>Projections of climate change</i><br>
  Climate models are used to simulate and quantify the climate response to present 
  and future human activities. The first step is to simulate the present climate 
  for extended simulation periods, typically many decades, under present conditions 
  without any change in external climate forcing.</p>
<p>The quality of these simulations is assessed by systematically comparing the 
  simulated climate with observations of the present climate. In this way the 
  model is evaluated and its quality established. A range of diagnostic tools 
  has been developed to assist the scientists in carrying out the evaluation. 
  This step is essential to gain confidence in and provide a baseline for projections 
  of human-induced climate change. Models may also be evaluated by running them 
  under different palaeoclimate (e.g. Ice Age) conditions. <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a> of this report presents a detailed assessment of the latest climate models 
  of various complexity, in particular the AOGCMs. Once the quality of the model 
  is established, two different strategies have been applied to make projections 
  of future climate change.</p>
<p>The first, so-called equilibrium method is to change, e.g. double, the carbon 
  dioxide concentration and to run the model again to a new equilibrium. The differences 
  between the climate statistics of the two simulations provide an estimate of 
  the climate change corresponding to the doubling of carbon dioxide, and of the 
  sensitivity of the climate to a change in the radiative forcing. This method 
  reduces systematic errors present in both simulations. If combined with simple 
  slab ocean models, this strategy is relatively cheap because it does not require 
  long runs to reach equilibrium. However it does not provide insight in to the 
  time dependence of climate change.</p>
<p>The second, so-called transient, method, common nowadays with improved computer 
  resources, is to force the model with a greenhouse gas and aerosol scenario. 
  The difference between such simulation and the original baseline simulation 
  provides a time-dependent projection of climate change.</p>
<p>This transient method requires a time-dependent profile of greenhouse gas and 
  aerosol concentrations. These may be derived from so-called emission scenarios. 
  Such scenarios have been developed, among others by IPCC, on the basis of various 
  internally coherent assumptions concerning future socio-economic and demographic 
  developments. In the SAR the IPCC Scenarios IS92 were used (IPCC, 1994). The 
  most recent IPCC emission scenarios are described in the IPCC Special Report 
  on Emission Scenarios (Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al., 2000). Different assumptions 
  concerning e.g. the growth of the world population, energy intensity and efficiency, 
  and economic growth, lead to considerably different emission scenarios. For 
  example the two extreme estimates in the IPCC IS92 scenarios of the carbon dioxide 
  emission by 2100 differ by a factor of 7. Because scenarios by their very nature 
  should not be used and regarded as predictions, the term "climate projections" 
  is used in this Report.</p>
<p>Transient simulations may also be based on artificially constructed, so-called 
  idealised, scenarios. For example, scenarios have been constructed, assuming 
  a gradual increase of greenhouse gas concentrations followed by stabilisation 
  at various levels. Climate simulations based on such idealised scenarios may 
  provide insight in to the climate response to potential policy measures leading 
  to a stabilisation of the GHG concentrations, which is the ultimate objective 
  of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as formulated 
  in its Article 2. See <a href="349.htm">Section 3 of Chapter 9</a> for an assessment.</p>
<p>Projections from present models show substantial agreement, but at the same 
  time there is still a considerable degree of ambiguity and difference between 
  the various models. All models show an increase in the globally averaged equilibrium 
  surface temperature and global mean precipitation. In <a href="338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a> the results of various models and intercomparison projects are assessed. 
  Model results are more ambiguous about the spatial patterns of climate change 
  than about the global response. Regional patterns depend significantly on the 
  time dependence of the forcing, the spatial distribution of aerosol concentrations 
  and details of the modelled climate processes. Research tools have been developed 
  to generate more reliable regional climate information. These tools and their 
  results are presented and assessed in <a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>.</p>
<p>To study the impact of climate change, a plausible and consistent description 
  of a possible future climate is required. The construction of such climate change 
  scenarios relies mainly on results from model projections, although sometimes 
  information from past climates is used. The basis for and development of such 
  scenarios is assessed in <a href="474.htm">Chapter 13</a>. Global and regional 
  sea-level change scenarios are reviewed in <a href="408.htm">Chapter 11</a>.</p>
<p><i>Predictability, global and regional</i><br>
  In trying to quantify climate change, there is a fundamental question to be 
  answered: is the evolution of the state of the climate system predictable? Since 
  the pioneering work by Lorenz in the 1960s, it is well known that complex non-linear 
  systems have limited predictability, even though the mathematical equations 
  describing the time evolution of the system are perfectly deterministic.</p>
<p>The climate system is, as we have seen, such a non-linear complex system with 
  many inherent time scales. Its predictability may depend on the type of climate 
  event considered, the time and space scales involved and whether internal variability 
  of the system or variability from changes in external forcing is involved. Internal 
  variations caused by the chaotic dynamics of the climate system may be predictable 
  to some extent. Recent experience has shown that the ENSO phenomenon may possess 
  a fair degree of predictability for several months or even a year ahead. The 
  same may be true for other events dominated by the long oceanic time-scales, 
  such as perhaps the NAO. On the other hand, it is not known, for example, whether 
  the rapid climate changes observed during the last glacial period are at all 
  predictable or are unpredictable consequences of small changes resulting in 
  major climatic shifts.</p>
<p>There is evidence to suggest that climate variations on a global scale resulting 
  from variations in external forcing are partly predictable. Examples are the 
  mean annual cycle and short-term climate variations from individual volcanic 
  eruptions, which models simulate well. Regularities in past climates, in particular 
  the cyclic succession of warm and glacial periods forced by geometrical changes 
  in the Sun-Earth orbit, are simulated by simple models with a certain degree 
  of success. The global and continental scale aspects of human-induced climate 
  change, as simulated by the models forced by increasing greenhouse gas concentration, 
  are largely reproducible. Although this is not an absolute proof, it provides 
  evidence that such externally forced climate change may be predictable, if their 
  forcing mechanisms are known or can be predicted.</p>
<p>Finally, global or continental scale climate change and variability may be 
  more predictable than regional or local scale change, because the climate on 
  very large spatial scales is less influenced by internal dynamics, whereas regional 
  and local climate is much more variable under the influence of the internal 
  chaotic dynamics of the system. See <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a> for an assessment 
  of the predictability of the climate system.</p>
<p><i>Rapid climate change</i><br>
  A non-linear system such as the climate system may exhibit rapid climate change 
  as a response to internal processes or rapidly changing external forcing. Because 
  the probability of their occurrence may be small and their predictability limited, 
  they are colloquially referred to as "unexpected events" or "surprises". 
  The abrupt events that took place during the last glacial cycle are often cited 
  as an example to demonstrate the possibility of such rapid climate change. Certain 
  possible abrupt events as a result of the rapidly increasing anthropogenic forcing 
  could be envisioned. Examples are a possible reorganization of the thermohaline 
  ocean circulation in the North Atlantic resulting in a more southerly course 
  of the Gulf Stream, which would have a profound influence on the climate of 
  Western Europe, a possible reduction of upper-level ocean cycling in the Southern 
  Ocean, or a possible but unlikely rapid disintegration of part of the Antarctic 
  ice sheet with dramatic consequences for the global sea level.</p>
<p>More generally, with a rapidly changing external forcing, the non-linear climate 
  system may experience as yet unenvisionable, unexpected, rapid change. <a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>, in particular <a href="306.htm">Section 7.7</a>, of this Report reviews 
  and assesses the present knowledge of non-linear events and rapid climate change. 
  Potential rapid changes in sea level are assessed in <a href="408.htm">Chapter 
  11</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="133"></a>1.3.3 Observing Anthropogenic Climate Change</h3>
<p><i>Observing the climate</i><br>
  The question naturally arises whether the system has already undergone human-induced 
  climate change. To answer this question, accurate and detailed observations 
  of climate and climate variability are required. Instrumental observations of 
  land and ocean surface weather variables and sea surface temperature have been 
  made increasingly widely since the mid-19th century. Recently, ships' observations 
  have been supplemented by data from dedicated buoys. The network of upper-air 
  observations, however, only became widespread in the late 1950s. The density 
  of observing stations always has been and still is extremely inhomogeneous, 
  with many stations in densely populated areas and virtually none in huge oceanic 
  areas. In recent times special earth-observation satellites have been launched, 
  providing a wide range of observations of various components of the climate 
  system all over the globe. The correct interpretation of such data still requires 
  high quality in situ and surface data. The longer observational records suffer 
  from changes in instrumentation, measurement techniques, exposure and gaps due 
  to political circumstances or wars. Satellite data also require compensation 
  for orbital and atmospheric transmission effects and for instrumental biases 
  and instabilities. Earlier the problems related to urbanisation were mentioned. 
  To be useful for the detection of climate change, observational records have 
  to be adjusted carefully for all these effects.<br>
  <br>
  Concern has been expressed about the present condition of the observational 
  networks. The number of upper-air observations, surface stations and observations 
  from ships is declining, partly compensated for by an increasing number of satellite 
  observations. An increasing number of stations are being automated, which may 
  have an impact on the quality and homogeneity of the observations. Maintaining 
  and improving the quality and density of existing observational networks is 
  essential for necessary high standard information. In order to implement and 
  improve systematic observations of all components of the climate system, the 
  World Meteorological Organization and the International Oceanographic Commission 
  have established a Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Initially GCOS uses 
  existing atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial networks. Later GCOS will aim 
  to amplify and improve the observational networks where needed and possible.<br>
  <br>
  Observations alone are not sufficient to produce a coherent and global picture 
  of the state of the climate system. So-called data assimilation systems have 
  been developed, which combine observations and their temporal and spatial statistics 
  with model information to provide a coherent quantitative estimate in space 
  and time of the state of the climate system. Data assimilation also allows the 
  estimation of properties which cannot easily be observed directly but which 
  are linked to the observations through physical laws. Some institutions have 
  recently reanalysed several decades of data by means of the most recent and 
  most sophisticated version of their data assimilation system, avoiding in this 
  way inhomogenities due to changes in their system. However inhomogeneities in 
  these reanalyses may still exist due to changing sources of information, such 
  as the introduction of new satellite systems.</p>
<p><i>The 20th century</i><br>
  Historically, human activities such as deforestation may have had a local or 
  regional impact, but there is no reason to expect any large human influence 
  on the global climate before the 20th century. Observations of the global climate 
  system during the 20th century are therefore of particular importance. <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a> presents evidence that there has been a mean global warming of 0.4 to 
  0.8&deg;C of the atmosphere at the surface since the late 19th century. <a href="052.htm#fig21">Figure 
  2.1</a> of <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a> shows that this increase took place 
  in two distinct phases, the first one between 1910 and 1945, and recently since 
  1976. Recent years have been exceptionally warm, with a larger increase in minimum 
  than in maximum temperatures possibly related, among other factors, to an increase 
  in cloud cover. Surface temperature records indicate that the 1990s are likely 
  to have been the warmest decade of the millennium in the Northern hemisphere, 
  and 1998 is likely to have been the warmest year. For instrumentally recorded 
  history, 1998 has been the warmest year globally. Concomitant with this temperature 
  increase, sea level has risen during the 20th century by 10 to 20 cm and there 
  has been a general retreat of glaciers worldwide, except in a few maritime regions, 
  e.g. Norway and New Zealand (<a href="408.htm">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<p>Regional changes are also apparent. The observed warming has been largest over 
  the mid- and high-latitude continents in winter and spring. Precipitation trends 
  vary considerably geographically and, moreover, data in most of the Southern 
  Hemisphere and over the oceans are scarce. From the data available, it appears 
  that precipitation has increased over land in mid- and high latitudes of the 
  Northern Hemisphere, especially during winter and early spring, and over most 
  Southern Hemisphere land areas. Over the tropical and the Northern Hemisphere 
  subtropical land areas, particularly over the Mediterranean region during winter, 
  conditions have become drier. In contrast, over large parts of the tropical 
  oceans rainfall has increased.<br>
  There is considerable variability of the atmospheric circulation at long time-scales. 
  The NAO for example, with its strong influence on the weather and climate of 
  extratropical Eurasia, fluctuates on multi-annual and multi-decadal time-scales, 
  perhaps influenced by varying temperature patterns in the Atlantic Ocean. Since 
  the 1970s the NAO has been in a phase that gives stronger westerly winds in 
  winter. Recent ENSO behaviour seems to have been unusual compared to that of 
  previous decades: there is evidence that El Ni&ntilde;o episodes since the mid-1970s 
  have been relatively more frequent than the opposite La Ni&ntilde;a episodes.<br>
  <br>
  There are suggestions that the occurrence of extreme weather events has changed 
  in certain areas, but a global pattern is not yet apparent. For example, it 
  is likely that in many regions of the world, both in the Northern and Southern 
  Hemisphere, there has been a disproportionate increase in heavy and extreme 
  precipitation rates in areas where the total precipitation has increased. Across 
  most of the globe there has been a decrease in the frequency of much below-normal 
  seasonal temperatures.<br>
  A detailed assessment of observed climate variability and change may be found 
  in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, and of observed sea level change in <a href="408.htm">Chapter 
  11</a>. <a href="093.htm#fig239a">Figure 2.39</a> of <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a> summarises observed variations in temperature and the hydrological cycle.</p>
<p><i>Detection and attribution</i><br>
  The fact that the global mean temperature has increased since the late 19th 
  century and that other trends have been observed does not necessarily mean that 
  an anthropogenic effect on the climate system has been identified. Climate has 
  always varied on all time-scales, so the observed change may be natural. A more 
  detailed analysis is required to provide evidence of a human impact.<br>
  <br>
  Identifying human-induced climate change requires two steps. First it must be 
  demonstrated that an observed climate change is unusual in a statistical sense. 
  This is the detection problem. For this to be successful one has to know quantitatively 
  how climate varies naturally. Although estimates have improved since the SAR, 
  there is still considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of this natural climate 
  variability. The SAR concluded nevertheless, on the basis of careful analyses, 
  that "the observed change in global mean, annually averaged temperature 
  over the last century is unlikely to be due entirely to natural fluctuations 
  of the climate system". <br>
  <br>
  Having detected a climatic change, the most likely cause of that change has 
  to be established. This is the attribution problem. Can one attribute the detected 
  change to human activities, or could it also be due to natural causes? Also 
  attribution is a statistical process. Neither detection nor attribution can 
  ever be "certain", but only probable in a statistical sense. The attribution 
  problem has been addressed by comparing the temporal and spatial patterns of 
  the observed temperature increase with model calculations based on anthropogenic 
  forcing by greenhouse gases and aerosols, on the assumption that these patterns 
  carry a fingerprint of their cause. In this way the SAR found that "there 
  is evidence of an emerging pattern of climate response to forcing by greenhouse 
  gases and sulphate aerosols in the observed climate record". Since the 
  SAR new results have become available which tend to support this conclusion. 
  The present status of the detection of climate change and attribution of its 
  causes is assessed in <a href="439.htm">Chapter 12</a>.</p>
