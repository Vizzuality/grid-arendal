<h4>7.2.2.4 Cloud-radiative feedback processes</h4>
<p>Clouds affect radiation both through their three-dimensional geometry and the 
  amount, size and nature of the hydrometeors which they contain. In climate models 
  these properties translate into cloud cover at different levels, cloud water 
  content (for liquid water and ice) and cloud droplet (or crystal) equivalent 
  radius. The interaction of clouds and radiation also involves other parameters 
  (asymmetry factor of the Mie diffusion) which depend on cloud composition, and 
  most notably on their phase. The subtle balance between cloud impact on the 
  solar short-wave (SW) and terrestrial long-wave (LW) radiation may be altered 
  by a change in any of those parameters. In response to any climate perturbation 
  the response of cloudiness thereby introduces feedbacks whose sign and amplitude 
  are largely unknown. While the SAR noted some convergence in the cloud radiative 
  feedback simulated by different models between two successive intercomparisons 
  (Cess et al., 1990, 1995, 1996), this convergence was not confirmed by a separate 
  consideration of the SW and LW components.</p>
<p> Schemes predicting cloudiness as a function of relative humidity generally 
  show an upward displacement of the higher troposphere cloud cover in response 
  to a greenhouse warming, resulting in a positive feedback (Manabe and Wetherald, 
  1987). While this effect still appears in more sophisticated models, and even 
  cloud resolving models (Wu and Moncrieff, 1999; Tompkins and Emanuel, 2000), 
  the introduction of cloud water content as a prognostic variable, by decoupling 
  cloud and water vapour, has added new features (Senior and Mitchell, 1993; Lee 
  et al., 1997). As noted in the SAR, a negative feedback corresponding to an 
  increase in cloud cover, and hence cloud albedo, at the transition between ice 
  and liquid clouds occurs in some models, but is crucially dependent on the definition 
  of the phase transition within models. The sign of the cloud cover feedback 
  is still a matter of uncertainty and generally depends on other related cloud 
  properties (Yao and Del Genio, 1999; Meleshko et al., 2000). </p>
<p> Most GCMs used for climate simulations now include interactive cloud optical 
  properties. Cloud optical feedbacks produced by these GCMs, however, differ 
  both in sign and strength. The transition between water and ice may be a source 
  of error, but even for a given water phase, the sign of the variation of cloud 
  optical properties with temperature can be a matter of controversy. Analysis 
  from the ISCCP data set, for example, revealed a decrease of low cloud optical 
  thickness with cloud temperature in the sub-tropical and tropical latitudes 
  and an increase at middle latitudes in winter (Tselioudis et al., 1992; Tselioudis 
  and Rossow, 1994). A similar relationship between cloud liquid water path and 
  cloud temperature was found in an analysis of microwave satellite observations 
  (Greenwald et al., 1995). This is opposite to the assumptions on adiabatic increase 
  of cloud liquid water content with temperature, adopted in early studies, and 
  still present in many models. Changes in cloud water path reflect different 
  effects which may partially compensate, such as changes in cloud vertical extension 
  or cloud water content. The role of low cloud optical thickness dependence on 
  climate was tested in 2xCO<sub>2</sub> experiments using the GISS GCM, in which 
  simulations with fixed or simulated cloud optical properties were compared (Tselioudis 
  et al., 1998). In spite of a low impact on global sensitivity, these results 
  showed a strong cloud impact on the latitudinal distribution of the warming. 
  High latitude warming decreased while low latitude warming increased, resulting 
  in a large decrease in the latitudinal amplification of the warming (by 20% 
  in the Northern Hemisphere and by 40% in the Southern Hemisphere).</p>
<p> Since the SAR, there has been much progress in the use of simplified tropical 
  models to understand the impact of cloud feedbacks, and to address the issue 
  of whether cloud feedbacks impose an upper limit on SST. This problem has been 
  addressed in simplified models that maintain consistency with the whole-tropics 
  energy budget (Pierrehumbert, 1995; Clement and Seager, 1999; Larson et al., 
  1999). Diagnostic studies have suggested both destabilising (Chou and Neelin, 
  1999) and stabilising (Lindzen et al., 2001) cloud feedbacks. None of this supports 
  the existence of a strict limitation of maximum tropical SST of the sort proposed 
  by Ramanathan and Collins (1991), which has been criticised on the grounds that 
  it does not respect the whole-tropics energy budget, and that it employs an 
  incorrect means of determining the threshold temperature for convection. It 
  is beyond question that the increased cloudiness prevailing over the warmer 
  portions of the Pacific has a strong effect on the surface energy budget, which 
  is fully competitive with the importance of evaporation. Determination of SST, 
  however, requires a consistent treatment of the top-of-atmosphere energy budget, 
  and cannot be effected with reference to the surface budget alone. This does 
  not preclude the possibility that other cloud feedback mechanisms could have 
  a profound effect on tropical SST, and in no way implies that cloud representation 
  is inconsequential in the tropics. Meehl et al. (2000) illustrate this point 
  when they show how a change from a diagnostic prescription of clouds in the 
  NCAR atmospheric GCM to a prognostic cloud liquid water formulation changes 
  the sign of net cloud forcing in the eastern tropical Pacific and completely 
  alters the nature of the coupled model response to increased greenhouse gases.</p>
