<h1>14.4 Outlook</h1>
<p>There is a growing recognition in the scientific community and more broadly 
  that:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Earth functions as a system, with properties and behaviour that are 
    characteristic of the system as a whole. These include critical thresholds, 
    "switch" or "control" points, strong non-linearities, 
    teleconnections, chaotic elements, and unresolvable uncertainties. Understanding 
    the components of the Earth system is critically important, but is insufficient 
    on its own to understand the functioning of the Earth system as a whole.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Humans are now a significant force in the Earth system, altering key process 
    rates and absorbing the impacts of global environmental changes. The environmental 
    significance of human activities is now so profound that the current geological 
    era can be called the "Anthropocene" (Crutzen and Stoermer, 2000).</li>
</ul>
<p>A scientific understanding of the Earth system is required to help human societies 
  develop in ways that sustain the global life support system. The clear challenge 
  of understanding climate variability and change and the associated consequences 
  and feedbacks is a specific and important example of the need for a scientific 
  understanding of the Earth as a system. It is also clear that the scientific 
  study of the whole Earth system, taking account of its full functional and geographical 
  complexity over time, requires an unprecedented effort of international collaboration. 
  It is well beyond the scope of individual countries and regions. <br>
</p>
<p>The world's scientific community, working in part through the three global 
  environmental change programmes (the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme 
  (IGBP), the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental 
  Change (IHDP), and the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)), has built a 
  solid base for understanding the Earth system. The IGBP, IHDP and WCRP have 
  also developed effective and efficient strategies for implementing global environmental 
  change research at the international level. The challenge to IGBP, IHDP and 
  WCRP is to build an international programme of Earth system science, driven 
  by a common mission and common questions, employing visionary and creative scientific 
  approaches, and based on an ever closer collaboration across disciplines, research 
  themes, programmes, nations and regions. <br>
</p>
<p>We need to build on our existing understanding of the Earth system and its 
  interactive human and non-human processes through time in order to:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>improve evaluation and understanding of current and future global change; 
    and<br>
  </li>
  <li>place on an increasingly firm scientific basis the challenge of sustaining 
    the global environment for future human societies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The climate system is particularly challenging since it is known that components 
  in the system are inherently chaotic, and there are central components which 
  affect the system in a non-linear manner and potentially could switch the sign 
  of critical feedbacks. The non-linear processes include the basic dynamical 
  response of the climate system and the interactions between the different components. 
  These complex, non-linear dynamics are an inherent aspect of the climate system. 
  Amongst the important non-linear processes are the role of clouds, the thermohaline 
  circulation, and sea ice. There are other broad non-linear components, the biogeochemical 
  system and, in particular, the carbon system, the hydrological cycle, and the 
  chemistry of the atmosphere.<br>
</p>
<p>Given the complexity of the climate system and the inherent multi-decadal time-scale, 
  there is a central and unavoidable need for long-term consistent data to support 
  climate and environmental change investigations. Data from the present and recent 
  past, credible global climate-relevant data for the last few centuries, along 
  with lower frequency data for the last several millennia, are all needed. Research 
  observational data sets that span significant temporal and spatial scales are 
  needed so that models can be refined, validated, or perhaps, most importantly, 
  rejected. The elimination of models because they are in conflict with climate-relevant 
  data is particularly important. Running unrealistic models will consume scarce 
  computing resources, and the results may add unrealistic information to the 
  needed distribution functions. Such data must be adequate in temporal and spatial 
  coverage, in parameters measured, and in precision, to permit meaningful validation. 
  We are still unfortunately short of data for the quantitative assessment of 
  extremes on the global scale in the observed climate.<br>
</p>
<p>In sum, there is a need for: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>more comprehensive data, contemporary, historical, and palaeological, relevant 
    to the climate system;<br>
  </li>
  <li>expanded process studies that more clearly elucidate the structure of fundamental 
    components of the Earth system and the potential for changes in these central 
    components;<br>
  </li>
  <li>greater effort in testing and developing increasingly comprehensive and 
    sophisticated Earth system models;<br>
  </li>
  <li>increased emphasis upon producing ensemble calculations of Earth system 
    models that yield descriptions of the likelihood of a broad range of different 
    possibilities, and finally;<br>
  </li>
  <li>new efforts in understanding the fundamental behaviour of large-scale non-linear 
    systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are significant challenges, but they are not insurmountable. The challenges 
  to understanding the Earth system including the human component are daunting, 
  and the pressing needs are significant. However, the opportunity for progress 
  exists, and, in fact, this opportunity simply must be realised. The issues are 
  too important, and they will not vanish. The challenges simply must be met.</p>
