<p><a name="fig65"></a>As direct measurements of TSI are only available over the 
  past two decades it is necessary to use other proxy measures of solar output 
  to deduce variations at earlier dates. In the simplest type of reconstruction 
  a proxy measure, such as sunspot number (Stevens and North, 1996) or solar diameter 
  (Nesme-Ribes et al., 1993), is calibrated against recent TSI measurements and 
  extrapolated backwards using a linear relationship. The various proxies vary 
  markedly as indicators of solar activity. For example, over the past century, 
  sunspot number and 10.7cm flux showed highest values at the solar maximum of 
  1958, whereas the aa index, which gives a measure of the magnitude of the solar 
  magnetic field at the Earth, peaked during 1990. This is because whereas sunspot 
  numbers return to essentially zero at each solar minimum the aa index shows 
  11-year cycles imposed on a longer-term modulation (Lean and Rind, 1998). Other 
  terrestrially based indicators of solar activity recorded by cosmogenic isotopes 
  in tree-rings and ice-cores also show longer term modulation. However, direct 
  solar proxies other than the sunspot number cover too short a period to reliably 
  detect such a trend. Thus, it is not clear which proxy, if any, can be satisfactorily 
  used to indicate past values of TSI.</p>
<p>A more fundamental approach recognises that solar radiative output is determined 
  by a balance between increases due to the development of faculae and decreases 
  due to the presence of sunspots. Longer-term changes are also speculated to 
  be occurring in the quiet Sun against which these variable active regions are 
  set. The sunspot darkening depends on the area of the solar disc covered by 
  the sunspots while the facular brightening has been related to a variety of 
  indices. These include sunspot number (Lean et al., 1995), emission of singly 
  ionised calcium (Ca II at 393.4 nm) (Lean et al., 1992), solar cycle length, 
  solar cycle decay rate, solar rotation rate and various empirical combinations 
  of all of these (Hoyt and Schatten, 1993; Solanki and Fligge, 1998).</p>
<p>In addition to estimates of the impact of active regions on TSI potential contributions 
  due to the variation in brightness of the quiet Sun have been estimated (Lean 
  et al., 1992; White et al., 1992). These were largely based on observations 
  of the behaviour of Sun-like stars (Baliunas and Jastrow, 1990) and the assumption 
  that during the Maunder Minimum (an extended period during the late 17th century 
  during which no sunspots were observed) the Sun was in a non-cycling state. 
  The various reconstructions vary widely in the values deduced for TSI during 
  the Maunder Minimum relative to the present. Mendoza (1997) has pointed out 
  that uncertainties in the assumptions made about the state of the Sun during 
  that period could imply a range of between 1 and 15 Wm<sup>-2</sup> reduction in TSI less 
  than present mean values although most estimates lie in the 3 to 5.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup> range. 
  <a href="#fig65">Figure 6.5</a> shows group sunspot numbers from 1610 to 1996 
  (Hoyt and Schatten, 1998) together with five TSI reconstructions. The sunspot 
  numbers (grey curve, scaled to correspond to Nimbus-7 TSI observations for 1979 
  to 1993) show little long-term trend. Lean et al. (1995, solid red curve) determine 
  long-term variability from sunspot cycle amplitude; Hoyt and Schatten (1993, 
  black solid curve) use mainly the length of the sunspot cycle; the two Solanki 
  and Fligge (1998) blue curves (dotted) are similar in derivation to the Lean 
  et al. and Hoyt and Schatten methods. Lockwood and Stamper (1999, heavy dash-dot 
  green curve) use an entirely different approach, based not on sunspot numbers 
  but on the aa geomagnetic index, and predict somewhat larger variation over 
  individual cycles but less on the longer term. Clearly, even disregarding the 
  shifts due to absolute scaling, there are large differences between the TSI 
  reconstructions. Thus knowledge of solar radiative forcing is uncertain, even 
  over the 20th century and certainly over longer periods.</p>

      The height of the rectangular bar denotes a central or best estimate value 
      while its absence denotes no best estimate is possible. The vertical line 
      about the rectangular bar with "x" delimiters indicates an estimate 
      of the uncertainty range, guided by the spread in the published values of 
      the forcing and physical understanding. A vertical line without a rectangular 
      bar and with "o" delimiters denotes a forcing for which no central 
      estimate can be given owing to large uncertainties. The uncertainty range 
      specified here has no statistical basis and therefore differs from the use 
      of the term elsewhere in this document. A "level of scientific understanding" 
      (LOSU) index is accorded to each forcing, with H, M, L and VL denoting high, 
      medium, low and very low levels, respectively. This represents our subjective 
      judgement about the reliability of the forcing estimate, involving factors 
      such as the assumptions necessary to evaluate the forcing, the degree of 
      our knowledge of the physical/chemical mechanisms determining the forcing, 
      and the uncertainties surrounding the quantitative estimate of the forcing 
      (see <a href="252.htm#tab612">Table 6.12</a>). The well-mixed greenhouse 
      gases are grouped together into a single rectangular bar with the individual 
      mean contributions due to CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and halocarbons (see <a href="221.htm#tab61">Tables 
      6.1</a> and <a href="251.htm#tab611">6.11</a>) shown; halocarbons refers 
      to all halogen-containing compounds listed in <a href="221.htm#tab61">Table 
      6.1</a>. "FF" denotes fossil fuel burning while "BB" 
      denotes biomass burning aerosol. Fossil fuel burning is separated into the 
      "black carbon" (bc) and "organic carbon" (oc) components 
      with its separate best estimate and range. The sign of the effects due to 
      mineral dust is itself an uncertainty. The indirect forcing due to tropospheric 
      aerosols is poorly understood. The same is true for the forcing due to aviation 
      via their effects on contrails and cirrus clouds. Only the first type of 
      indirect effect due to aerosols as applicable in the context of liquid clouds 
      is considered here. The second type of effect is conceptually important 
      but there exists very little confidence in the simulated quantitative estimates. 
      The forcing associated with stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions 
      is highly variable over the period and is not considered for this plot (however, 
      see <a href="254.htm#fig68">Figure 6.8d</a>). All the forcings shown have 
      distinct spatial and seasonal features (<a href="253.htm#fig67">Figure 6.7</a>) 
      such that the global, annual means appearing on this plot do not yield a 
      complete picture of the radiative perturbation. They are only intended to 
      give, in a relative sense, a first-order perspective on a global, annual 
      mean scale, and cannot be readily employed to obtain the climate response 
      to the total natural and/or anthropogenic forcings. As in the SAR, it is 
      emphasised that the positive and negative global mean forcings cannot be 
      added up and viewed a priori as providing offsets in terms of the complete 
      global climate impact. </td>

<p><a name="fig66"></a>An alternative approach which has been used to reconstruct 
  TSI (Reid, 1997; Soon et al., 1996) is to assume that time variations in global 
  surface temperature are due to a combination of the effects of solar variability 
  and enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations and to find that combination of these 
  two forcings which best combine to simulate surface temperature measurements. 
  However, these authors did not take natural climatic variability into account 
  and a TSI series derived by such methods could not be used as an independent 
  measure of radiative forcing of climate.</p>
<p>The estimate for solar radiative forcing since 1750 of 0.3 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, shown in <a href="#fig66">Figure 
  6.6</a>, is based on the values in <a href="#fig65">Figure 6.5</a> (taking the 
  11-year cycle minimum values in 1744 and 1996). Clearly the starting date of 
  1750 (chosen for the date of the pre-industrial atmosphere in <a href="#fig66">Figure 
  6.6</a>) is crucial here: a choice of 1700 would give values about twice as 
  large; a choice of 1776 would give smaller values (particularly using the Hoyt 
  and Schatten series). The range of 0.1 to 0.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup> given in <a href="#fig66">Figure 
  6.6</a> is based on the variability of the series, the differences between the 
  reconstructions and uncertainties concerning stratospheric adjustment (see <a href="#61121">Section 
  6.11.2.1</a>). However, because of the large uncertainty in the absolute value 
  of TSI and the reconstruction methods our assessment of the "level of scientific 
  understanding" is "very low".</p>
<h3><a name="6112"></a>6.11.2 Mechanisms for Amplification of Solar Forcing</h3>
<h4><a name="61121"></a>6.11.2.1 Solar ultraviolet variation</h4>
<p>The Sun emits radiation over the entire electromagnetic spectrum but with most 
  energy in the near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared regions: 80% of TSI 
  lies between 400 and 1,600 nm. The variations in TSI, discussed above, of a 
  few tenths of one per cent thus represent the integrated change across ultraviolet, 
  visible, and near infrared wavelengths. Most of this radiation passes through 
  the atmosphere unhindered to the tropopause but shorter wavelengths are absorbed 
  in the middle atmosphere where they result in O<sub>3</sub> formation and local heating. 
  In the ultraviolet the amplitude of variability is much higher. Since 1978 (see 
  Cebula et al. (1998) for a review) satellite data have shown variations over 
  the 27-day solar rotation period of e.g., 6% at 200 nm and 2.5% at 250 nm. Problems 
  with sensor drift and calibration preclude direct detection of variability on 
  the 11-year time-scale at wavelengths longer than about 250 nm. Instead ultraviolet 
  irradiance cycles are deduced from observations by scaling the 27-day variations 
  to selected solar activity indices and assuming that the same scaling applies 
  over longer time-scales (Lean et al., 1997). With the launch of the SOLSTICE 
  (Rottman et al., 1993) and SUSIM (Brueckner et al., 1993) instruments on UARS 
  in 1991, measurements have now been made from near solar maximum to solar minimum 
  with long-term precisions that approach 1% at some wavelengths (Rottman et al., 
  1993; Floyd et al., 1998). Careful cross-calibration of NOAA-11 SBUV/2 with 
  Shuttle SBUV observations (Cebula et al., 1998) have also produced spectral 
  variations 1989 to 1994, but also with uncertainties of a few per cent, which 
  exceeds the actual irradiance variability at the longer ultraviolet wavelengths. 
  Comparison of the SOLSTICE, SUSIM, and SBUV/2 data show reasonable agreement 
  during their 2 to 3 year overlap period (DeLand and Cebula, 1998) and suggest 
  a decline of about 7% at 200 to 208 nm and of about 3.5% at 250 nm from solar 
  maximum in 1989 to near solar minimum in 1994. These estimates agree well with 
  the modelled scalings deduced from the 27-day variations (Lean et al., 1997).</p>
<p>Variations in stratospheric composition and thermal structure resulting from 
  ultraviolet irradiance changes may have an impact on tropospheric climate. The 
  first mechanism whereby this might happen is through changes in radiative forcing 
  (Haigh, 1994). Thus, in addition to a direct increase in downward short-wave 
  irradiance at the tropopause, higher solar activity can cause an increase in 
  downward infrared flux by heating the stratosphere and also radiative forcing 
  due to O<sub>3</sub> changes. However, the sign of the O<sub>3</sub> effect is not well established. 
  Haigh (1994) found that O<sub>3</sub> increases reduced the solar radiative forcing by 
  about 0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> at solar maximum, Wuebbles et al. (1998) computed a value of 
  -0.13 Wm<sup>-2</sup> due to O<sub>3</sub> increases since the Maunder Minimum and Myhre et al. (1998a) 
  about -0.02 Wm<sup>-2</sup> from minimum to maximum of the solar cycle. Hansen et al. (1997a) 
  showed an additional forcing of about +0.05 Wm<sup>-2</sup> from minimum to maximum of 
  a solar cycle due to O<sub>3</sub> increases and lower strato-spheric warming. Haigh (1999) 
  and Larkin et al. (2000) suggest that the O<sub>3</sub> effect has little effect on radiative 
  forcing at the tropopause but significant effect on where the additional radiation 
  is absorbed (more within the troposphere rather than at the surface). These 
  disparities may represent the different approaches used. Haigh (1994), Wuebbles 
  et al. (1998), and Myhre et al. (1998a) calculated the O<sub>3</sub> response using two-dimensional 
  chemical-transport models in which temperature changes are estimated using the 
  fixed dynamic heating approximation. The Hansen et al. (1997a) value was deduced 
  from studies with a simplified GCM of sensitivity to slab O<sub>3</sub> changes (of unspecified 
  cause) and the assumption that the solar-induced O<sub>3</sub> change is all within the 
  10 to 150 hPa region. Haigh (1999) and Larkin et al. (2000) specified solar 
  irradiance and O<sub>3</sub> changes and calculated the stratospheric temperature response 
  in GCMs. The negative radiative forcing values probably correspond to O<sub>3</sub> change 
  profiles which peak at higher altitudes, and thus have less impact on lower 
  stratospheric temperature and long-wave radiative forcing, although the different 
  methods for calculating temperature change may also be important.</p>
<p>The response of O<sub>3</sub> to solar variability is not well established. Two-dimensional 
  models (e.g., Haigh, 1994; Fleming et al., 1995; Wuebbles et al., 1998) predict 
  the largest fractional changes in the middle-upper stratosphere with monotonically 
  decreasing effects towards the tropopause. Multiple regression analysis of satellite 
  data as carried out with SBUV data by McCormack and Hood (1996) and SAGE data 
  by Wang et al. (1996) suggest the largest changes in the upper and lower stratosphere 
  and zero, or even slightly negative, changes in the middle stratosphere. However, 
  as the data are only available over about one and a half solar cycles, have 
  large uncertainties, especially in the lower stratosphere, and may not properly 
  have accounted for the effects of volcanic aerosol (Solomon et al., 1996), the 
  true nature of solar-induced changes in stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Chandra et al. (1999) have estimated tropical tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> column amounts 
  by taking the difference between TOMS total columns in clear-sky areas and those 
  with deep convective cloud. They deduced O<sub>3</sub> changes of the order 10% of the 
  tropo-spheric column over the eleven year cycle occurring out of phase with 
  the solar forcing. This they ascribed to a self-feedback effect on O<sub>3</sub> production 
  with enhanced levels of O<sub>3</sub> aloft resulting in less ultraviolet reaching the 
  troposphere. However, it is also possible that the O<sub>3</sub> changes reflect a response 
  to solar effects in tropospheric dynamics. If the changes are real then solar 
  radiative forcing, as represented in <a href="#fig66">Figure 6.6</a>, should 
  be reduced by approximately 30% due to solar-induced decreases in tropo-spheric 
  O<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>Changes in stratospheric thermal structure may also affect the troposphere 
  through dynamical interactions rather than through radiative forcing. Kodera 
  (1995) suggested that changes in strato-spheric zonal wind structure, brought 
  about by enhanced solar heating, could interact with vertically propagating 
  planetary waves in the winter hemisphere to produce a particular mode of response. 
  This mode, also seen in response to heating in the lower stratosphere caused 
  by injection of volcanic aerosol, shows dipole anomalies in zonal wind structure 
  which propagate down, over the winter period, into the troposphere. Rind and 
  Balachandran (1995) investigated the impact of large increases in solar ultra-violet 
  on the troposphere with a GCM and confirmed that altered refraction characteristics 
  affect wave propagation in winter high latitudes. Solar cycle changes to wave 
  propagation in the middle atmosphere were also investigated by Arnold and Robinson 
  (1998) who used a three-dimensional model of the atmosphere between 10 and 140 
  km to study the effects of thermospheric heating. They found that non-linear 
  interactions in the winter hemisphere resulted in changes to the stratospheric 
  circulation. It is not clear that the signals discussed above are statistically 
  robust in any of these studies.</p>
<p>Haigh (1996, 1999), Shindell et al. (1999), and Larkin et al. (2000) have introduced 
  realistic changes in ultraviolet and O<sub>3</sub> into GCMs and found that the inclusion 
  of the O<sub>3</sub> has a significant effect on simulated climate. Haigh (1999) using 
  a GCM with a lid at 10 hPa and few stratospheric levels, showed a pattern of 
  change in zonal mean temperature which was consistent over a range of assumptions 
  concerning the magnitude of the ultraviolet and O<sub>3</sub> changes. This pattern consisted 
  of warming in the stratosphere (except in winter high latitudes) and a vertical 
  banding structure in the troposphere due to shifts in the positions of the sub-tropical 
  jets. The predicted changes in 30 hPa geopotential heights were of similar form 
  to those observed by Labitzke and van Loon (1997) but of smaller magnitude (by 
  about a factor 3). Larkin et al. (2000) found very similar patterns of change 
  to those of Haigh (1999) using the same solar irradiance/O<sub>3</sub> changes but an entirely 
  different GCM with a lid at 0.1 hPa. Shindell et al. (1999) used a model with 
  a detailed representation of the middle atmosphere and a parametrized photochemical 
  scheme which allows O<sub>3</sub> to respond to changes in ultraviolet flux but not to 
  changes in wind fields. They showed larger amplitude changes in 30 hPa heights 
  in the winter hemisphere, more like those of Labitzke and van Loon (1997) but 
  with little summer hemisphere response. These experiments suggest that further 
  work is needed to establish the response of O<sub>3</sub> to solar variability and to how 
  this affects climate.</p>
