<h1><a name="111"></a>11.1 Introduction </h1>
<p>Sea level change is an important consequence of climate change, both for societies 
  and for the environment. In this chapter, we deal with the measurement and physical 
  causes of sea level change, and with predictions for global-average and regional 
  changes over the next century and further into the future. We reach qualitatively 
  similar conclusions to those of Warrick et al. (1996) in the IPCC WGI Second 
  Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR). However, improved measurements 
  and advances in modelling have given more detailed information and greater confidence 
  in several areas. The impacts of sea level change on the populations and eco-systems 
  of coastal zones are discussed in the <a href="../wg2/index.htm">IPCC WGII TAR</a> (IPCC, 
  2001).</p>
<p>The level of the sea varies as a result of processes operating on a great range 
  of time-scales, from seconds to millions of years. Our concern in this report 
  is with climate-related processes that have an effect on the time-scale of decades 
  to centuries. In order to establish whether there is a significant anthropogenic 
  influence on sea level, the longer-term and non-climate-related processes have 
  to be evaluated as well. </p>
<p>"Mean sea level" at the coast is defined as the height of the sea with respect 
  to a local land benchmark, averaged over a period of time, such as a month or 
  a year, long enough that fluctuations caused by waves and tides are largely 
  removed. Changes in mean sea level as measured by coastal tide gauges are called 
  "relative sea level changes", because they can come about either by movement 
  of the land on which the tide gauge is situated or by changes in the height 
  of the adjacent sea surface (both considered with respect to the centre of the 
  Earth as a fixed reference). These two terms can have similar rates (several 
  mm/yr) on time-scales greater than decades. To infer sea level changes arising 
  from changes in the ocean, the movement of the land needs to be subtracted from 
  the records of tide gauges and geological indicators of past sea level. Widespread 
  land movements are caused by the isostatic adjustment resulting from the slow 
  viscous response of the mantle to the melting of large ice sheets and the addition 
  of their mass to the oceans since the end of the most recent glacial period 
  ("Ice Age") (<a href="419.htm#11241">Section 11.2.4.1</a>). Tectonic land movements, 
  both rapid displacements (earthquakes) and slow movements (associated with mantle 
  convection and sediment transport), can also have an important effect on local 
  sea level (<a href="422.htm">Section 11.2.6</a>).</p>
<p>We estimate that global average eustatic sea level change over the last hundred 
  years is within the range 0.10 to 0.20 m (<a href="424.htm">Section 11.3.2</a>). 
  ("Eustatic" change is that which is caused by an alteration to the volume of 
  water in the world ocean.) These values are somewhat higher than the sum of 
  the predictions of the contributions to sea level rise (<a href="428.htm">Section 
  11.4</a>). The discrepancy reflects the imperfect state of current scientific 
  knowledge. In an attempt to quantify the processes and their associated rates 
  of sea level change, we have critically evaluated the error estimates (<a href="410.htm#box111">Box 
  11.1</a>). However, the uncertainties remain substantial, although some have 
  narrowed since the SAR on account of improved observations and modelling.</p>

        For indicating the uncertainty of data (measurements or model results), 
        two options have been used in this chapter.</b>&uml;</p>
      <ol>
        <li> For data fulfilling the usual statistical requirements, the uncertainty 
          is indicated as &plusmn; 1 standard deviation (&plusmn; 1s).</li>
        <li> For limited data sets or model results, the full range is shown by 
          quoting either all available data or the two extremes. In these cases, 
          outliers may be included in the data set and the use of an arithmetic 
          mean or central value might be misleading. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>To combine uncertainties when adding quantities, we used the following 
        procedures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Following the usual practice for independent uncertainties, the variances 
          were added (i.e. the standard deviations were combined in quadrature).</li>
        <li>Ranges were combined by adding their extreme values, because in these 
          cases the true value is very likely to lie within the overall range.</li>
        <li>To combine a standard deviation with a range, the standard deviation 
          was first used to derive a range by taking &plusmn; 2 standard deviations 
          about the mean, and then the ranges were combined.</li>

<p>Eustatic sea level change results from changes to the density or to the total 
  mass of water. Both of these relate to climate. Density is reduced by thermal 
  expansion occurring as the ocean warms. Observational estimates of interior 
  temperature changes in the ocean reported by Warrick et al. (1996) were limited, 
  and estimates of thermal expansion were made from simple ocean models. Since 
  the SAR, more observational analyses have been made and estimates from several 
  Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) have become available (<a href="411.htm#1121">Section 
  11.2.1</a>). Thermal expansion is expected to contribute the largest component 
  to sea level rise over the next hundred years (<a href="429.htm#11511">Section 
  11.5.1.1</a>). Because of the large heat capacity of the ocean, thermal expansion 
  would continue for many centuries after climate had been stabilised (<a href="434.htm#11541">Section 
  11.5.4.1</a>).</p>
<p>Exchanges with water stored on land will alter the mass of the ocean. (Note 
  that sea level would be unaffected by the melting of sea ice, whose weight is 
  already supported by the ocean.) Groundwater extraction and impounding water 
  in reservoirs result in a direct influence on sea level (<a href="421.htm">Section 
  11.2.5</a>). Climate change is projected to reduce the amount of water frozen 
  in glaciers and ice caps (<a href="413.htm#1122">Sections 11.2.2</a>, <a href="429.htm#11511">11.5.1.1</a>) 
  because of increased melting and evaporation. Greater melting and evaporation 
  on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (<a href="416.htm">Sections 11.2.3</a>, 
  <a href="429.htm#11511">11.5.1.1</a>) is also projected, but might be outweighed 
  by increased precipitation. Increased discharge of ice from the ice sheets into 
  the ocean is also possible. The ice sheets react to climate change by adjusting 
  their shape and size on time-scales of up to millennia, so they could still 
  be gaining or losing mass as a result of climate variations over a history extending 
  as far back as the last glacial period, and they would continue to change for 
  thousands of years after climate had been stabilised (<a href="435.htm#11543">Section 
  11.5.4.3</a>). </p>
<p>Sea level change is not expected to be geographically uniform (<a href="432.htm">Section 
  11.5.2</a>), so information about its distribution is needed to inform assessments 
  of the impacts on coastal regions. Since the SAR, such information has been 
  calculated from several AOGCMs. The pattern depends on ocean surface fluxes, 
  interior conditions and circulation. The most serious impacts are caused not 
  only by changes in mean sea level but by changes to extreme sea levels (<a href="433.htm#11532">Section 
  11.5.3.2</a>), especially storm surges and exceptionally high waves, which are 
  forced by meteorological conditions. Climate-related changes in these therefore 
  also have to be considered. </p>
