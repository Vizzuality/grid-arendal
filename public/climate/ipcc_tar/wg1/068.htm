<h4><a name="2321"></a>2.3.2.1 Palaeoclimate proxy indicators</h4>
<p>A "proxy" climate indicator is a local record 
  that is interpreted using physical or biophysical principles to represent some 
  combination of climate-related variations back in time. Palaeoclimate proxy 
  indicators have the potential to provide evidence for large-scale climatic changes 
  prior to the existence of widespread instrumental or historical documentary 
  records. Typically, the interpretation of a proxy climate record is complicated 
  by the presence of "noise" in which climate information is immersed, 
  and a variety of possible distortions of the underlying climate information 
  (e.g., Bradley, 1999; Ren, 1999a,b). Careful calibration and cross-validation 
  procedures are necessary to establish a reliable relationship between a proxy 
  indicator and the climatic variable or variables it is assumed to represent, 
  providing a "transfer" function through which past climatic conditions 
  can be estimated. High-resolution proxy climate indicators, including tree rings, 
  corals, ice cores, and laminated lake/ocean sediments, can be used to provide 
  detailed information on annual or near-annual climate variations back in time. 
  Certain coarser resolution proxy information (from e.g., boreholes, glacial 
  moraines, and non-laminated ocean sediment records) can usefully supplement 
  this high-resolution information. Important recent advances in the development 
  and interpretation of proxy climate indicators are described below. </p>
<p><i>Tree rings</i><br>
  Tree-ring records of past climate are precisely dated, annually resolved, and 
  can be well calibrated and verified (Fritts, 1976). They typically extend from 
  the present to several centuries or more into the past, and so are useful for 
  documenting climate change in terrestrial regions of the globe. Many recent 
  studies have sought to reconstruct warm-season and annual temperatures several 
  centuries or more ago from either the width or the density of annual growth 
  rings (Briffa et al., 1995; D'Arrigo et al., 1996; Jacoby et al., 1996; 
  D'Arrigo et al., 1998; Wiles et al., 1998; Hughes et al., 1999; Cook et 
  al., 2000). Recently, there has been a concerted effort to develop spatial reconstructions 
  of past temperature variations (e.g., Briffa et al., 1996) and estimates of 
  hemispheric and global temperature change (e.g., Briffa et al., 1998b; Briffa, 
  2000). Tree-ring networks are also now being used to reconstruct important indices 
  of climate variability over several centuries such as the Southern Oscillation 
  Index (Stahle et al., 1998), the North Atlantic Oscillation (Cook et al., 1998; 
  Cullen et al., 2001) and the Antarctic Oscillation Index (Villalba et al., 1997) 
  (see also <a href="083.htm#26">Section 2.6</a>), as well as patterns of pre-instrumental 
  precipitation and drought (<a href="078.htm#2522">Section 2.5.2.2</a>).</p>
<p>Several important caveats must be borne in mind when using tree-ring data for 
  palaeoclimate reconstructions. Not least is the intrinsic sampling bias. Tree-ring 
  information is available only in terrestrial regions, so is not available over 
  substantial regions of the globe, and the climate signals contained in tree-ring 
  density or width data reflect a complex biological response to climate forcing. 
  Non-climatic growth trends must be removed from the tree-ring chronology, making 
  it difficult to resolve time-scales longer than the lengths of the constituent 
  chronologies (Briffa, 2000). Furthermore, the biological response to climate 
  forcing may change over time. There is evidence, for example, that high latitude 
  tree-ring density variations have changed in their response to temperature in 
  recent decades, associated with possible non-climatic factors (Briffa et al., 
  1998a). By contrast, Vaganov et al. (1999) have presented evidence that such 
  changes may actually be climatic and result from the effects of increasing winter 
  precipitation on the starting date of the growing season (see <a href="090.htm#2722">Section 
  2.7.2.2</a>). Carbon dioxide fertilization may also have an influence, particularly 
  on high-elevation drought-sensitive tree species, although attempts have been 
  made to correct for this effect where appropriate (Mann et al., 1999). Thus 
  climate reconstructions based entirely on tree-ring data are susceptible to 
  several sources of contamination or non-stationarity of response. For these 
  reasons, investigators have increasingly found tree-ring data most useful when 
  supplemented by other types of proxy information in "multi-proxy" 
  estimates of past temperature change (Overpeck et al., 1997; Jones et al., 1998; 
  Mann et al., 1998; 1999; 2000a; 2000b; Crowley and Lowery, 2000).</p>
<p><i>Corals</i><br>
  Palaeoclimate reconstructions from corals provide insights into the past variability 
  of the tropical and sub-tropical oceans and atmosphere, prior to the instrumental 
  period, at annual or seasonal resolutions, making them a key addition to terrestrial 
  information. Because of their potential to sample climate variations in ENSO-sensitive 
  regions, a modest network of high-quality coral site records can resolve key 
  large-scale patterns of climate variability (Evans et al., 1998). The corals 
  used for palaeoclimate reconstruction grow throughout the tropics in relatively 
  shallow waters, often living for several centuries. Accurate annual age estimates 
  are possible for most sites using a combination of annual variations in skeletal 
  density and geochemical parameters. Palaeoclimate reconstructions from corals 
  generally rely on geochemical characteristics of the coral skeleton such as 
  temporal variations in trace elements or stable isotopes or, less frequently, 
  on density or variations in fluorescence. Dunbar and Cole (1999) review the 
  use of coral records for palaeoclimatic reconstruction. </p>
<p><i>Ice cores</i><br>
  Ice cores from polar regions of northern Greenland, Canada and the islands of 
  the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, Antarctica, and alpine, tropical and sub-tropical 
  locations (e.g., Thompson, 1996) can provide several climate-related indicators. 
  These indicators include stable isotopes (e.g., 18O), the fraction of melting 
  ice, the rate of accumulation of precipitation, concentrations of various salts 
  and acids, the implied atmospheric loading of dust pollen, and trace gases such 
  as CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been increased activity in creating high-resolution Antarctic 
  ice core series e.g., for the past millennium (Peel et al., 1996; Mayewski and 
  Goodwin, 1997; Morgan and van Ommen, 1997). In certain regions, isotope information 
  from ice cores shows the late 20th century temperatures as the warmest few decades 
  in the last 1,000 years (Thompson et al., 2000a). Key strengths of ice core 
  information are their high resolution (annual or even seasonal where accumulations 
  rates are particularly high - see van Ommen and Morgan, 1996, 1997), availability 
  in polar and high-elevation regions where other types of proxy climate information 
  like tree-ring data are not available, and their provision of multiple climate- 
  and atmosphere-related variables from the same reasonably well dated physical 
  location (e.g., the GISP2 core; White et al., 1998a). A weakness of ice core 
  data is regional sampling bias (high elevation or high latitude) and melt water 
  and precipitation accumulation data are not easy to date accurately.</p>
<p>The best dated series are based on sub-annual sampling of cores and the counting 
  of seasonal ice layers. Such series may have absolute dating errors as small 
  as a few years in a millennium (Fisher et al., 1996). Dating is sometimes performed 
  using volcanic acid layers with assumed dates (e.g., Clausen et al., 1995) but 
  uncertainties in the volcanic dates can result in dating uncertainties throughout 
  the core (Fisher et al., 1998).</p>
<p><i>Lake and ocean sediments</i><br>
  Annually laminated (varved) lake sediments offer considerable potential as high-resolution 
  archives of palaeo-environmental conditions where other high-resolution proxy 
  indicators are not available (e.g., arid terrestrial regions), and latitudes 
  poleward of the treeline (Lamoureux and Bradley, 1996; Wohlfarth et al., 1998; 
  Hughen et al., 2000). When annual deposition of the varves can be independently 
  confirmed (e.g., through radiometric dating), they provide seasonal to interannual 
  resolution over centuries to millennia. Varved sediments can be formed from 
  biological processes or from the deposition of inorganic sediments, both of 
  which are often influenced by climate variations. Three primary climate variables 
  may influence lake varves: (a) summer temperature, serving as an index of the 
  energy available to melt the seasonal snowpack, or snow and ice on glaciers; 
  (b) winter snowfall, which governs the volume of discharge capable of mobilising 
  sediments when melting; and (c) rainfall. Laminated lake sediments dominated 
  by (a) can be used for inferences about past high latitude summer temperature 
  changes (e.g., Overpeck et al., 1997), while sediments dominated by the latter 
  two influences can be used to estimate past drought and precipitation patterns 
  (<a href="078.htm#2522">Section 2.5.2.2</a>).</p>
<p>Ocean sediments may also be useful for high-resolution climate reconstructions. 
  In rare examples, annually laminated sediments can be found (e.g., Hughen et 
  al., 1996; Black et al., 1999) and it is possible to incorporate isotope and 
  other information in climate reconstructions, much as varved lake sediments 
  are used. Otherwise, sedimentation rates may sometimes still be sufficiently 
  high that century-scale variability is resolvable (e.g., the Bermuda rise ocean 
  sediment oxygen isotope record of Keigwin, 1996). Dating in such cases, however, 
  must rely on radiometric methods with relatively poor age control. </p>
<p><i>Borehole measurements</i><br>
  Borehole measurements attempt to relate profiles of temperature with depth to 
  the history of temperature change at the ground surface. The present global 
  database of more than 600 borehole temperature-depth profiles has the densest 
  geographic coverage in North America and Europe, but sparser data are available 
  in other regions (e.g., Australia, Asia, Africa and South America). The depths 
  of the temperature profiles range from about 200 to greater than 1,000 m, allowing 
  palaeo-temperature reconstructions back several hundred to a thousand years. 
  Although large-scale temperature reconstructions have been made to more than 
  a millennium ago (Huang et al., 1997), they show substantial sensitivity to 
  assumptions that are needed to convert the temperature profiles to ground surface 
  temperature changes. Borehole data are probably most useful for climate reconstructions 
  over the last five centuries (Pollack et al., 1998).</p>

<p><a href="#fig219">Figure 2.19</a> shows a reconstructed global ground 
  surface temperature history (Pollack et al., 1998; see also Huang et al., 2000) 
  from an average of the 358 individual sites, most located in North America and 
  Eurasia, but some located in Africa, South America and Australia (similar results 
  are obtained by Huang et al., 2000, using an updated network of 616 sites). 
  Superimposed is an instrumental estimate of global surface air temperature (Jones 
  and Briffa, 1992). The ensemble of reconstructions shows that the average ground 
  temperature of the Earth has increased by about 0.5&deg;C during the 20th century, 
  and that this was the warmest of the past five centuries. About 80% of the sites 
  experienced a net warming over this period. The estimated mean cumulative ground 
  surface temperature change since 1500 is close to 1.0 &plusmn; 0.3&deg;C. Uncertainties 
  due to spatial sampling (see Pollack et al., 1998 and Huang et al., 2000) are 
  also shown. It should be noted that the temporal resolution of the borehole 
  estimates decreases sharply back in time, making it perilous to compare the 
  shape of the trend shown in <a href="#fig219">Figure 2.19</a> with better-resolved 
  trends determined from higher-resolution climate proxy data discussed below.</p>
<p>While borehole data provide a direct estimate of ground surface temperatures 
  under certain simplifying assumptions about the geothermal properties of the 
  earth near the borehole, a number of factors complicate their interpretation. 
  Non-temperature-related factors such as land-use changes, natural land cover 
  variations, long-term variations in winter snow cover and soil moisture change 
  the sub-surface thermal properties and weaken the interpretation of the reconstructions 
  as estimates of surface air temperature change. In central England, where seasonal 
  snow cover is not significant, and major land-use changes occurred many centuries 
  ago, borehole ground surface temperature trends do tend to be similar to those 
  in long instrumental records (Jones, 1999). In contrast, Skinner and Majorowicz 
  (1999) show that borehole estimates of ground surface temperature warming during 
  the 20th century in north-western North America are 1 to 2&deg;C greater than 
  in corresponding instrumental estimates of surface air temperature. They suggest 
  that this discrepancy may be due to land-use changes that can enhance warming 
  of the ground surface relative to that of the overlying atmospheric boundary 
  layer (see also Lewis, 1998). Such factors need to be better understood before 
  borehole temperature measurements can be confidently interpreted.</p>
