<h4>9.3.2.1 Summary</h4>
<p>First we note results assessed here that reconfirm results from the SAR:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As the climate warms, Northern Hemisphere snow cover and sea-ice extent 
    decrease. The globally averaged precipitation increases.</li>
  <li>As the radiative forcing of the climate system changes, the land warms faster 
    than the ocean. The cooling effect of tropo-spheric aerosols moderates warming 
    both globally and locally.</li>
  <li>The surface air temperature increase is smaller in the North Atlantic and 
    circumpolar Southern Ocean regions.</li>
  <li>Most tropical areas, particularly over ocean, have increased precipitation, 
    with decreases in most of the sub-tropics, and relatively smaller precipitation 
    increases in high latitudes. </li>
  <li>The signal to noise ratio (from the multi-model ensemble) is greater for 
    surface air temperature than for precipitation. </li>
</ul>
<p>A second category of results assessed here are those that are new since the 
  SAR:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are many more model projections for a given scenario, and more scenarios. 
    The greater number of model simulations allows us to better quantify patterns 
    of climate change for a given forcing and develop a measure of consistency 
    among the models.</li>
  <li>Including the direct effect of sulphate aerosols according to an IS92a type 
    estimate reduces global mean mid-21st century warming. The indirect effect, 
    not included in most AOGCM experiments to date, is acknowledged to be uncertain, 
    as discussed in Chapter 6. </li>
  <li>The geographic details of various forcing patterns are less important than 
    differences among the models' responses for the scenarios considered 
    here. This is the case for the global mean as well as for patterns of climate 
    response. Thus, the choice of model and the choice of scenario are both important.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="933"></a>9.3.3 Range of Temperature Response to SRES Emission Scenarios</h3>
<p>This section investigates the range of future global mean temperature changes 
  resulting from the thirty-five final SRES emissions scenarios with complete 
  greenhouse gas emissions (Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al., 2000). This range 
  is compared to the expected range of uncertainty due to the differences in the 
  response of several AOGCMs. Forcing uncertainties are not considered in these 
  calculations. As well as envelope results that incorporate all the SRES scenarios, 
  six specific SRES scenarios are considered. These are the four illustrative 
  marker scenarios A1B, A2, B1 and B2 and two further illustrative scenarios from 
  the A1 family representing different energy technology options; A1FI and A1T 
  (see <a href="350.htm#9313">Section 9.3.1.3</a> and <a href="343.htm#box91">Box 
  9.1</a>). For comparison, results are also shown for some of the IS92 scenarios. 
  As discussed in <a href="350.htm#9313">Section 9.3.1.3</a> some AOGCMs have 
  run experiments with some or all of the four draft marker scenarios. In order 
  to investigate the temperature change implications of the full range of the 
  final SRES scenarios, a simple climate model is used as a tool to simulate the 
  AOGCM results (Wigley and Raper, 1992; Raper et al., 1996, 2001a). The tuning 
  of the simple model to emulate the different AOGCM results is described in <a href="371.htm">Appendix 
  9.1</a>. The original SRES MiniCAM (Mini Climate Assessment Model from the Pacific 
  Northwest National Laboratory, USA) scenarios did not contain emissions for 
  the reactive gases CO, NMVOCs, and NO<sub>x</sub> (Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al., 2000). 
  To facilitate the calculations, the MiniCAM modelling team provided emissions 
  paths for these gases.</p>
<p>For the six illustrative SRES scenarios, anthropogenic emissions are shown 
  for CO<sub>2</sub> in <a href="095.htm">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="123.htm#fig312">Figure 
  3.12</a>, tabulated for CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O in <a href="519.htm">Appendix 
  II</a> and shown in Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al. (2000), and shown for SO<sub>2</sub> 
  in <a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="208.htm#fig513">Figure 5.13</a>. 
  It is evident that these scenarios encompass a wide range of emissions. Note 
  in particular the much lower future sulphur dioxide emissions for the six SRES 
  scenarios compared with the IS92a scenario. </p>
<p>The calculation of radiative forcing from the SRES emission scenarios for the 
  temperature projections presented here follows closely that described in <a href="095.htm">Chapters 
  3</a>, <a href="127.htm">4</a>, <a href="160.htm">5</a> and <a href="212.htm">6</a>, 
  with some exceptions as described below. Further details of the forcing for 
  the collective procedures (MAGICC model) are given by Wigley (2000). Atmospheric 
  concentrations of the greenhouse gases are calculated from the emissions using 
  gas cycle models. For CO<sub>2</sub>, the model of Wigley (1993) is used and 
  as described therein, the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation factor is adjusted to 
  give a balanced 1980s mean budget. To be consistent with <a href="095.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>, climate feedbacks are included and the model has been tuned to give results 
  that are similar to those of the Bern-CC and ISAM models for a climate sensitivity 
  of 2.5&deg;C (<a href="095.htm">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="123.htm#fig312">Figure 
  3.12</a>). The strength of the climate feedbacks on the carbon cycle are very 
  uncertain, but models show they are in the direction of greater temperature 
  change giving greater atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The climate 
  feedbacks in the Bern-CC model are greater than those of the ISAM model and 
  the feedback strength used here is about half as big as that in the ISAM model. 
  The gas cycle models for CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O and the other trace 
  gases are identical to those used in <a href="127.htm">Chapter 4</a>. The concentrations 
  for the main greenhouse gases for the six SRES scenarios are shown in <a href="127.htm">Chapter 
  4</a>, <a href="152.htm#fig414">Figure 4.14</a>.</p>
<p>Except for the treatment of organic carbon (OC), black carbon (BC) and indirect 
  aerosol forcing, the method of calculation for the radiative forcing follows 
  closely that described in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a> and includes tropospheric 
  ozone, halocarbons, and stratospheric ozone. For OC and BC this report's 
  best estimate forcing values for the present day given in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>, <a href="251.htm#tab611">Table 6.11</a> are used. As pointed out in <a href="160.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>, past and future emissions of OC and BC are uncertain. Here fossil OC 
  and BC direct aerosol forcings are considered together and are scaled linearly 
  with SO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Biomass burning OC and BC aerosol direct forcings 
  are both scaled with gross deforestation. First (cloud albedo) indirect sulphate 
  aerosol forcing components are included and scaled non-linearly with SO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions as derived by Wigley (1991). A present day indirect sulphate aerosol 
  forcing of -0.8 Wm<sup>-2</sup> is assumed. This is the same value as that 
  employed in the SAR. It is well within the range of values recommended by <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>, and is also consistent with that deduced from model simulations and the 
  observed temperature record (<a href="439.htm">Chapter 12</a>).</p>

<p><a name="fig913"></a>Estimated total historical anthropogenic radiative forcing 
  from 1765 to 1990 followed by forcing resulting from the six illustrative SRES 
  scenarios are both shown in <a href="#fig913">Figure 9.13a</a>. It is evident 
  that the six SRES scenarios considered cover nearly the full range of forcing 
  that results from the full set of SRES scenarios. The latter is shown on <a href="#fig913">figure 
  9.13a</a> as an envelope since the forcing resulting from individual scenarios 
  cross with time. For comparison, radiative forcing is also shown for the IS92a, 
  IS92c and IS92e scenarios. It is evident that the range in forcing for the new 
  SRES scenarios is wider and higher than in the IS92 scenarios. The range is 
  wider due to more variation in emissions of non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases. 
  The shift to higher forcing is mainly due to the reduced future sulphur dioxide 
  emissions of the SRES scenarios compared to the IS92 scenarios. Secondary factors 
  include generally greater tropospheric ozone forcing, the inclusion of climate 
  feedbacks in the carbon cycle and slightly larger cumulative carbon emissions 
  featured in some SRES scenarios.</p>
<p><a href="#fig913">Figure 9.13b</a> shows the simple climate model simulations 
  representing AOGCM-calibrated global mean temperature change results for the 
  six illustrative SRES scenarios and for the full SRES scenario envelopes. The 
  individual scenario time-series and inner envelope (darker shading) are the 
  average results obtained from simulating the results of seven AOGCMs, denoted 
  "ensemble". The average of the effective climate sensitivity of these 
  AOGCMs is 2.8&deg;C (see <a href="371.htm">Appendix 9.1</a>). The range of global 
  mean temperature change from 1990 to 2100 given by the six illustrative scenarios 
  for the ensemble is 2.0 to 4.5&deg;C (see <a href="#fig914">Figure 9.14</a>). 
  The range for the six illustrative scenarios encompassing the results calibrated 
  to the DOE PCM and GFDL_R15_a AOGCM parameter settings is 1.4 to 5.6&deg;C. 
  These two AOGCMs have effective climate sensitivities of 1.7 and 4.2&deg;C, 
  respectively (see <a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a>). The range for these 
  two parameter settings for the full set of SRES scenarios is 1.4 to 5.8&deg;C. 
  Note that this is not the extreme range of possibilities, for two reasons. First, 
  forcing uncertainties have not been considered. Second, some AOGCMs have effective 
  climate sensitivities outside the range considered (see <a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 
  9.1</a>). For example, inclusion of the simple model's representation of 
  the CCSR/NIES2 AOGCM would increase the high end of the range by several degrees 
  C.</p>
<p>Since the AOGCM SRES results discussed in <a href="350.htm#9313">Section 9.3.1.3</a> 
  are based on the draft marker SRES scenarios, it is important to note differences 
  that would result from the use of the final SRES scenarios. Based on a comparison 
  using the simple climate model, the final scenarios for the three markers A1B, 
  A2 and B2 give temperature changes that are slightly smaller than those of the 
  draft scenarios (Smith et al., 2001). The main difference is a change in the 
  standardised values for 1990 through 2000, which are common to all these scenarios. 
  This results in higher forcing early in the period. There are further small 
  differences in net forcing, but these decrease until, by 2100, differences in 
  temperature change in the two versions of these scenarios are only 1 to 2%. 
  For the B1 scenario, however, temperature changes are significantly lower in 
  the final version. The difference is almost 20% in 2100, as a result of generally 
  lower emissions across the whole range of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>Temperature change results from the simple climate model tuned to individual 
  AOGCMs using the six illustrative SRES scenarios are shown in <a href="#fig915">Figure 
  9.15</a>. For comparison, analogous results are shown for the IS92a scenario. 
  For direct comparison with the SAR, results are also shown for some of the IS92 
  scenarios using the SAR forcing and the SAR version of the simple climate model 
  (Kattenberg et al., 1996). The results give rise to conclusions similar to those 
  of Wigley (1999) and Smith et al. (2001), which were drawn from sensitivity 
  studies using the SAR version of the simple climate model. First, note that 
  the range of temperature change for the SRES scenarios is shifted higher than 
  the range for the IS92 scenarios, primarily because of the higher forcing as 
  described above. </p>
<p>A second feature of the illustrative SRES scenarios is that their relative 
  ranking in terms of global mean temperature changes varies with time (Wigley, 
  1999; Smith et al. 2001). The temperature-change values of the scenarios cross 
  in about mid-century because of links between the emissions of different gases. 
  In particular, for scenarios with higher fossil fuel use, and therefore carbon 
  dioxide emissions (for example A2), sulphur dioxide emissions are also higher. 
  In the near term (to around 2050) the cooling effect of higher sulphur dioxide 
  emissions more than offsets the warming caused by increased emissions of greenhouse 
  gases in scenarios such as A2. The effect of the high sulphur dioxide emissions 
  in the IS92a scenario is similar. It causes IS92a to give rise to a lower 2030 
  temperature than any of the specific SRES scenarios considered (<a href="#fig915">Figure 
  9.15a</a>). The opposite effect is seen for scenarios B1 and B2, which have 
  lower fossil fuel emissions, but also lower sulphur dioxide emissions. This 
  leads to a larger near-term warming. In the longer term, however, the level 
  of emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrous 
  oxide becomes the dominant determinant of the resulting global mean temperature 
  changes. For example, by the latter part of the 21st century, the higher emissions 
  of greenhouse gases in scenario A2 result in larger climate changes than in 
  the other three marker scenarios (A1B, B1 and B2) even though this scenario 
  also has higher sulphur dioxide emissions.</p>

<p>Considering the six illustrative scenarios, the bars on the right-hand side 
  of <a href="#fig914">Figure 9.14</a> show that scenarios A1FI and B1 alone, 
  define the top and bottom of the range of projected temperature changes, respectively. 
  Towards the middle of the range the scenario bars overlap, indicating that most 
  of the projections fall within this region. In the corresponding sea level rise 
  figure, because of the greater intertia in the ocean response, there is a greater 
  overlap in the projected response to the various scenarios (see <a href="408.htm">Chapter 
  11</a>, <a href="429.htm#fig1112">Figure 11.12</a>). In addition, the sea level 
  range for a given scenario is broadened by inclusion of uncertainty in land 
  ice estimates.</p>
<p>By 2100, the differences in the surface air temperature response across the 
  group of climate models forced with a given scenario is as large as the range 
  obtained by a single model forced with the different SRES scenarios (<a href="#fig915">Figure 
  9.15</a>). Given the quasi-linear nature of the simple model, projections which 
  go outside the range as yet explored by AOGCMs must be treated with caution, 
  since non-linear effects may come into play. Further uncertainties arise due 
  to uncertainties in the radiative forcing. The uncertainty in sulphate aerosol 
  forcing is generally characterised in terms of the 1990 radiative forcing. Wigley 
  and Smith (1998) and Smith et al. (2001) examined the effect of this uncertainty 
  on future temperature change by varying the assumed 1990 sulphate radiative 
  forcing by 0.6 Wm<sup>-2</sup> above and below a central value of -1.1 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup>. Reducing the sulphate forcing increased the 1990 to 2100 warming 
  by 0 to 7% (depending on the scenario), while increasing the sulphate forcing 
  decreased warming over the next century by a similar amount. The sensitivity 
  to the uncertainty in sulphate forcing was found to be significantly less in 
  the new scenarios than in the IS92a scenario; in the latter the sensitivity 
  to sulphate forcing was twice as large as the largest value for the SRES marker 
  scenarios. Therefore, the smaller future emissions of sulphur dioxide in the 
  new scenarios significantly lowers the uncertainty in future global mean temperature 
  change due to the uncertain value of present day sulphate aerosol forcing. The 
  climate effects described here use the SRES scenarios as contained in Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; 
  et al. (2000). Any feedbacks on the socio-economic development path, and hence 
  on emissions, as a result of these climate changes have not been included.</p>
