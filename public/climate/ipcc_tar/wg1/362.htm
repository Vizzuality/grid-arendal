<h4>9.3.5.3 Decadal and longer time-scale variability</h4>
<p>A few studies have attempted to look at model-simulated changes in modes of 
  low-frequency variability due to anthropogenic climate change. Particular attention 
  has focused on changes in ENSO as reported in the SAR and in <a href="361.htm">Section 
  9.3.5.2</a>, and the AO or NAO and AAO which are prominent features of low-frequency 
  variability in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively (e.g., Fyfe 
  et al., 1999; Osborn et al., 1999; Paeth et al., 1999; Shindell et al., 1999; 
  Ulbrich and Christoph, 1999; Zorita and Gonz&aacute;lez-Rouco, 2000; Monahan 
  et al., 2000). It should be noted that these studies have used a variety of 
  methods for analysing trends in these modes of variability, including indices 
  based on pressure differentials and principal components (PCs) of hemispheric 
  sea level pressure (SLP). In addition, these indices are sensitive to changes 
  in the SLP patterns with time or forcing and so trends must be treated with 
  some caution. Wallace (2000) finds that in both observations and modelling studies 
  of increased greenhouse gases, the trends are larger in the PC of SLP than in 
  the pressure differential indices. Meehl et al. (2000c) show that the changed 
  base climate state in a future warmer climate could affect the period of global 
  ENSO-like decadal (10 to 20-year period) variability such that there could be 
  a shift to longer periods. </p>
<p>Ulbrich and Christoph (1999) find that the NAO index, based on SLP fluctuations 
  over the North Atlantic in the 300-year control run of their model, shows only 
  a moderate increase over the length of a 240-year scenario run with increasing 
  greenhouse gases. The long-term trend exceeds the variability of the control 
  climate only at the end of the simulation in 2100. In contrast, the steadily 
  growing storm track activity over north-west Europe already surpasses the standard 
  deviation defined from the control run after about 160 years. This effect is 
  associated with a change of the NAO pattern. During the length of the scenario 
  experiment, empirical orthogonal functions for sequential 10-year periods show 
  a systematic north-eastward shift of the NAO's northern variability centre 
  from a position close to the east coast of Greenland, where it is also located 
  in the control run, to the Norwegian Sea (<a href="#fig927">Figure 9.27</a>)</p>
<p>Osborn et al. (1999) show an initial small increase followed by a decrease 
  in the NAO index in one model when forced with increases in greenhouse gases 
  or with greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols. Paeth et al. (1999) have assessed 
  changes in both the mean and variance of the NAO on decadal time-scales at quadrupled 
  CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrations using an ensemble of four integrations of a single model. 
  They find a statistically significant increase in the mean NAO index (at the 
  95% confidence level), especially during late summer/autumn and in winter, suggesting 
  more westerly and typically milder weather over Europe during the cold season. 
  However, the increase in the mean NAO index is accompanied by a reduction in 
  the low-frequency variability of the NAO (<a href="#fig928">Figure 9.28</a>) 
  (significant at the 5% significance level after 1910) suggesting that the NAO 
  stabilises in the positive phase. Shindell et al. (1999) found a trend towards 
  more positive values of the AO index with increased greenhouse gases in a model 
  which included a representation of the stratosphere, but not in troposphere-only 
  versions of the same model. They attribute this to the high correlation of the 
  stratospheric circulation with SLP in the Arctic (e.g., Kitoh et al., 1996; 
  Kodera et al., 1996).</p>

<p>In an ensemble of 1900 to 2100 transient integrations with greenhouse gas and 
  aerosol forcing changes, Fyfe et al. (1999) find a positive trend in the mean 
  AO and AAO indices. They argue that in their model this is as a result of essentially 
  unchanged AO/AAO patterns superimposed onto a forced climate change. The result 
  of Fyfe et al. (1999) suggests that since the mean AO/AAO increases, it might 
  imply a change to higher-frequency variability, as the positive AO phase has 
  enhanced westerlies and is typically correlated with above-average storminess. 
  In a subsequent non-linear analysis by Monahan et al. (2000) of a 1,000-year 
  control and 500-year stabilisation integration (with greenhouse gas and aerosol 
  forcing fixed at their year 2100 levels) it is found that (1) in the control 
  integration the AO is part of a more general non-linear mode of tropospheric 
  variability which is strongly bimodal and partitions the variability into two 
  distinct regimes, and (2) in the stabilisation integration the occupancy statistics 
  of these regimes change rather than the modes themselves. </p>
<p>In summary, there is not yet a consistent picture emerging from coupled models 
  as to their ability to reproduce trends in climate regimes such as the recently 
  observed upward trend in the NAO/AO index (<a href="048.htm">Chapters 2</a> 
  and <a href="439.htm">12</a>). In addition, whilst several models show an increase 
  in the NAO/AO index with increased greenhouse gases, this is not true for all 
  models, and the magnitude and character of the changes vary across models. Such 
  results do not necessarily suggest that the forced climate change is manifest 
  as a change in the occurrence of only one phase of these modes of variability.
