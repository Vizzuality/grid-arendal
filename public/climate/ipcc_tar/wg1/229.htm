<h3>6.6.2 Indirect Forcings of Methane, Carbon Monoxide and Non-Methane Hydrocarbons</h3>
<p>CH<sub>4</sub> is oxidised primarily (&gt;90%) in the troposphere through reaction 
  with OH. Since the CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation cycle provides a substantial fraction 
  of the OH loss in the troposphere, there is strong interaction between OH and 
  CH<sub>4</sub>. This causes the OH to decrease when CH<sub>4</sub> increases, 
  leading to a further increase in CH<sub>4</sub>. This chemical feedback is examined 
  in <a href="127.htm">Chapter 4</a>. Lelieveld and Crutzen (1992), Br&uuml;hl 
  (1993), Lelieveld et al. (1993, 1998), Hauglustaine et al. (1994) and Fuglestvedt 
  et al. (1996) estimated that this feedback added 25 to 35% to the direct CH<sub>4</sub> 
  forcing depending on the initial CH<sub>4</sub> perturbation and the model used. 
  These values are in line with the 30% contribution estimated by IPCC (1992) 
  and the SAR. The tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> increase associated with photochemical 
  production from the CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation cycle also contributes to enhancing 
  the total CH<sub>4</sub> radiative forcing. The forcing from enhanced levels 
  of tropo-spheric O<sub>3</sub> estimated by Lelieveld and Crutzen (1992), Lelieveld 
  et al. (1993, 1998), Hauglustaine et al. (1994) and Fuglestvedt et al. (1996) 
  contributes a further 30 to 40% on top of the CH<sub>4</sub> forcing, due directly 
  to CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. IPCC (1992) estimated a lower contribution of O<sub>3</sub> 
  of approximately 20%. Lelieveld et al. (1998) have estimated a direct radiative 
  forcing associated with CH<sub>4</sub> increase since the pre-industrial era 
  (1850 to 1992) of 0.33 Wm<sup>-2</sup> and an additional forcing of 0.11 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  associated with OH feedback. The increased tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> contributes 
  an additional 0.11 Wm<sup>-2</sup> and stratospheric H<sub>2</sub>O another 
  0.02 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. These authors found that the total CH<sub>4</sub> forcing 
  (0.57 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) is higher by 73% than the direct forcing. The CH<sub>4</sub> 
  radiative forcing given in <a href="218.htm">Section 6.3</a> (0.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) 
  and based on recorded CH<sub>4</sub> concentration increase includes both the 
  direct and OH indirect contributions. This updated forcing is higher by 14% 
  than the 0.44 Wm<sup>-2</sup> obtained by Lelieveld et al. (1998) on the basis 
  of calculated present day and pre-industrial CH<sub>4</sub> distributions. In 
  addition to that, oxidation of CH<sub>4</sub> also leads to the formation of 
  CO<sub>2</sub>, providing a further indirect effect.</p>
<p>In contrast to CH<sub>4</sub>, the direct radiative forcing of CO is relatively 
  small (Evans and Puckrin, 1995; Sinha and Toumi, 1996). Sinha and Toumi (1996) 
  have estimated a clear sky radiative forcing of 0.024 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for a 
  uniform increase in CO from 25 ppbv to 100 ppbv. However, CO plays a primary 
  role in governing OH abundances in the troposphere. As indicated by Prather 
  (1994, 1996) and Daniel and Solomon (1998), CO emissions into the atmosphere 
  may have a significant impact on climate forcing due to chemical impact on CH<sub>4</sub> 
  lifetime, and tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> photochemical production 
  (see <a href="127.htm">Chapter 4</a>). The contribution of these indirect effects 
  to the GWPs based on box model calculations are presented in <a href="247.htm">Section 
  6.12</a>. Similarly, NMHCs have a small direct radiative forcing. Highwood et 
  al. (1999) estimated an upper limit of 0.015 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (1% of the present 
  day forcing due to other greenhouse gases) on the globally averaged direct forcing 
  of sixteen NMHCs. As indicated by Johnson and Derwent (1996), the indirect forcing 
  through changes in OH and tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> is also small for each 
  NMHC taken individually but can be significant taken as a family. The indirect 
  forcings of NMHCs are still poorly quantified and require the use of global 
  three-dimensional chemical transport models. Accurate calculations of these 
  effects are a notoriously difficult problem in atmospheric chemistry.</p>
