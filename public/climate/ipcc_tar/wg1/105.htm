<p><a name="fig32"></a>Despite the importance of biological processes for the 
  ocean's natural carbon cycle, current thinking maintains that the oceanic 
  uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> is primarily a physically and chemically 
  controlled process superimposed on a biologically driven carbon cycle that is 
  close to steady state. This differs from the situation on land because of the 
  different factors which control marine and terrestrial primary productivity. 
  On land, experiments have repeatedly shown that current CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  are limiting to plant growth (<a href="102.htm">Section 3.2.2.4</a>). In the 
  ocean, experimental evidence is against control of productivity by CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations, except for certain species at lower than contemporary CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations (Riebesell et al., 1993; Falkowski, 1994). Further, deep ocean 
  concentrations of major nutrients and DIC are tightly correlated, with the existing 
  ratios closely (but not exactly, see <a href="106.htm">Section 3.2.3.3</a>) 
  matching the nutritional requirements of marine organisms (the "Redfield 
  ratios": Redfield et al., 1963). This implies that as long as nutrients 
  that are mixed into the ocean surface layer are largely removed by organic carbon 
  production and export, then there is little potential to drive a net air-sea 
  carbon transfer simply through alteration of the global rate of production. 
  Terrestrial ecosystems show greater variability in this respect because land 
  plants have multiple ways to acquire nutrients, and have greater plasticity 
  in their chemical composition (Melillo and Gosz, 1983). There are, however, 
  extensive regions of the ocean surface where major nutrients are not fully depleted, 
  and changes in these regions may play a significant role in altering atmosphere-ocean 
  carbon partitioning (see <a href="106.htm">Section 3.2.3.3</a>). </p>
<p>The increase of atmospheric <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> over pre-industrial levels 
  has tended to increase uptake into natural CO<sub>2</sub> sink regions and decreased 
  release from natural outgassing regions. Contemporary net air-sea fluxes comprise 
  spatially-varying mixtures of natural and anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> flux 
  components and cannot be equated with anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, except 
  on a global scale. Uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> is strongest in regions 
  where "old" waters, which have spent many years in the ocean interior 
  since their last contact with the atmosphere, are re-exposed at the sea surface 
  to a contemporary atmosphere which now contains anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> 
  (e.g., Sarmiento et al., 1992; Doney, 1999). In an upwelling region, for example, 
  the natural component of the air-sea flux may be to outgas CO<sub>2</sub> to 
  the atmosphere. The higher atmospheric <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> of the contemporary 
  atmosphere acts to reduce this outgassing relative to the natural state, implying 
  that more carbon remains in the ocean. This represents uptake of anthropogenic 
  CO<sub>2</sub> by a region which is a source of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. 
  The additional carbon in the ocean resulting from such uptake is then transported 
  by the surface ocean circulation, and eventually stored as surface waters sink, 
  or are mixed, into the deep ocean interior. Whereas upwelling into the surface 
  layer is quantitatively balanced on a global scale by sinking, the locations 
  where deep waters rise and sink can be separated by large horizontal distances. 
</p>
<p>Air-sea gas transfer allows older waters to approach a new steady state with 
  higher atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels after about a year at the sea surface. 
  This is fast relative to the rate of ocean mixing, implying that anthropogenic 
  CO<sub>2</sub> uptake is limited by the rate at which "older" waters 
  are mixed towards the air-sea interface. The rate of exposure of older, deeper 
  waters is therefore a critical factor limiting the uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>. 
  In principle, there is sufficient uptake capacity (see Box 3.3) in the ocean 
  to incorporate 70 to 80% of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the atmosphere, 
  even when total emissions of up to 4,500 PgC are considered (Archer et al., 
  1997). The finite rate of ocean mixing, however, means that it takes several 
  hundred years to access this capacity (Maier-Reimer and Hasselmann, 1987; Enting 
  et al., 1994; Archer et al., 1997). Chemical neutralisation of added CO<sub>2</sub> 
  through reaction with CaCO<sub>3</sub> contained in deep ocean sediments could 
  potentially absorb a further 9 to 15% of the total emitted amount, reducing 
  the airborne fraction of cumulative emissions by about a factor of 2; however 
  the response time of deep ocean sediments is in the order of 5,000 years (Archer 
  et al., 1997).</p>
<p>Using time-series and global survey data, the increasing oceanic carbon content 
  has been directly observed, although the signal is small compared to natural 
  variability and requires extremely accurate measurements (Sabine et al., 1997). 
  A long-term increase of surface water CO<sub>2</sub> levels tracking the mean 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increase has been observed in the ocean's subtropical 
  gyres (Bates et al., 1996; Winn et al., 1998) and the equatorial Pacific (Feely 
  et al., 1999b). However, very few such time-series exist and the response of 
  other important oceanic regions to the atmospheric <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> increase 
  cannot yet be assessed. Inter-decadal increases in DIC concentrations at depth 
  have been resolved from direct measurements (Wallace, 1995; Peng et al., 1998; 
  Ono et al., 1998; Sabine et al., 1999). The total amounts of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> 
  accumulated in the ocean since the pre-industrial era can also be estimated 
  from measurements using recent refinements (Gruber et al., 1996) of long-standing 
  methods for separating the natural and anthropogenic components of oceanic DIC. 
  A comparison of such analyses with ocean model results is presented in <a href="117.htm">Section 
  3.6.3</a>. </p>
