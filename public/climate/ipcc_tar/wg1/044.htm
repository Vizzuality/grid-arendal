<h2><a name="13"></a>1.3 Human-induced Climate Variations</h2>
<h3><a name="131"></a>1.3.1 Human Influence on the Climate System</h3>
<p>Human beings, like other living organisms, have always influenced their environment. 
  It is only since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, mid-18th century, 
  that the impact of human activities has begun to extend to a much larger scale, 
  continental or even global. Human activities, in particular those involving 
  the combustion of fossil fuels for industrial or domestic usage, and biomass 
  burning, produce greenhouse gases and aerosols which affect the composition 
  of the atmosphere. The emission of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other chlorine 
  and bromine compounds has not only an impact on the radiative forcing, but has 
  also led to the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer. Land-use change, 
  due to urbanisation and human forestry and agricultural practices, affect the 
  physical and biological properties of the Earth's surface. Such effects 
  change the radiative forcing and have a potential impact on regional and global 
  climate.</p>
<p><i>Anthropogenic perturbation of the atmospheric composition</i><br>
  For about a thousand years before the Industrial Revolution, the amount of greenhouse 
  gases in the atmosphere remained relatively constant. Since then, the concentration 
  of various greenhouse gases has increased. The amount of carbon dioxide, for 
  example, has increased by more than 30% since pre-industrial times and is still 
  increasing at an unprecedented rate of on average 0.4% per year, mainly due 
  to the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation. We know that this increase 
  is anthropogenic because the changing isotopic composition of the atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> betrays the fossil origin of the increase. The concentration 
  of other natural radiatively active atmospheric components, such as methane 
  and nitrous oxide, is increasing as well due to agricultural, industrial and 
  other activities. The concentration of the nitrogen oxides (NO and NO<sub>2</sub>) 
  and of carbon monoxide (CO) are also increasing. Although these gases are not 
  greenhouse gases, they play a role in the atmospheric chemistry and have led 
  to an increase in tropospheric ozone, a greenhouse gas, by 40% since pre-industrial 
  times (<a href="127.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Moreover, NO<sub>2</sub> is an important 
  absorber of visible solar radiation.</p>
<p>Chlorofluorocarbons and some other halogen compounds do not occur naturally 
  in the atmosphere but have been introduced by human activities. Beside their 
  depleting effect on the stratospheric ozone layer, they are strong greenhouse 
  gases. Their greenhouse effect is only partly compensated for by the depletion 
  of the ozone layer which causes a negative forcing of the surface-troposphere 
  system. All these gases, except tropospheric ozone and its precursors, have 
  long to very long atmospheric lifetimes and therefore become well-mixed throughout 
  the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Human industrial, energy related, and land-use activities also increase the 
  amount of aerosol in the atmosphere, in the form of mineral dust, sulphates 
  and nitrates and soot. Their atmospheric lifetime is short because they are 
  removed by rain. As a result their concentrations are highest near their sources 
  and vary substantially regionally, with global consequences. The increases in 
  greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosol content in the atmosphere result in 
  a change in the radiative forcing to which the climate system must act to restore 
  the radiative balance.</p>
<p><i>The enhanced greenhouse effect</i><br>
  The increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere enhances the 
  absorption and emission of infrared radiation. The atmosphere's opacity 
  increases so that the altitude from which the Earth's radiation is effectively 
  emitted into space becomes higher. Because the temperature is lower at higher 
  altitudes, less energy is emitted, causing a positive radiative forcing. This 
  effect is called the enhanced greenhouse effect, which is discussed in detail 
  in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<p>If the amount of carbon dioxide were doubled instantaneously, with everything 
  else remaining the same, the outgoing infrared radiation would be reduced by 
  about 4 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. In other words, the radiative forcing corresponding 
  to a doubling of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would be 4 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. 
  To counteract this imbalance, the temperature of the surface-troposphere system 
  would have to increase by 1.2&deg;C (with an accuracy of &plusmn;10%), in the 
  absence of other changes. In reality, due to feedbacks, the response of the 
  climate system is much more complex. It is believed that the overall effect 
  of the feedbacks amplifies the temperature increase to 1.5 to 4.5&deg;C. A significant 
  part of this uncertainty range arises from our limited knowledge of clouds and 
  their interactions with radiation. To appreciate the magnitude of this temperature 
  increase, it should be compared with the global mean temperature difference 
  of perhaps 5 or 6&deg;C from the middle of the last Ice Age to the present interglacial.</p>
<p>The so-called water vapour feedback, caused by an increase in atmospheric water 
  vapour due to a temperature increase, is the most important feedback responsible 
  for the amplification of the temperature increase. Concern has been expressed 
  about the strength of this feedback, in particular in relation to the role of 
  upper tropospheric humidity. Since the SAR, thinking about this feedback has 
  become increasingly sophisticated thanks both to modelling and to observational 
  studies. Feedbacks are discussed and assessed in <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>. 
  In particular, the present state of knowledge of the water vapour feedback is 
  examined in <a href="266.htm#721">Section 7.2.1</a>.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the absorption by CO<sub>2</sub> is already saturated 
  so that an increase would have no effect. This, however, is not the case. Carbon 
  dioxide absorbs infrared radiation in the middle of its 15 mm band to the extent 
  that radiation in the middle of this band cannot escape unimpeded: this absorption 
  is saturated. This, however, is not the case for the band's wings. It is 
  because of these effects of partial saturation that the radiative forcing is 
  not proportional to the increase in the carbon dioxide concentration but shows 
  a logarithmic dependence. Every further doubling adds an additional 4 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  to the radiative forcing.</p>
<p>The other human-made greenhouse gases add to the effect of increased carbon 
  dioxide. Their total effect at the surface is often expressed in terms of the 
  effect of an equivalent increase in carbon dioxide.</p>
<p><i>The effect of aerosols</i><br>
  The effect of the increasing amount of aerosols on the radiative forcing is 
  complex and not yet well known. The direct effect is the scattering of part 
  of the incoming solar radiation back into space. This causes a negative radiative 
  forcing which may partly, and locally even completely, offset the enhanced greenhouse 
  effect. However, due to their short atmospheric lifetime, the radiative forcing 
  is very inhomogeneous in space and in time. This complicates their effect on 
  the highly non-linear climate system. Some aerosols, such as soot, absorb solar 
  radiation directly, leading to local heating of the atmosphere, or absorb and 
  emit infrared radiation, adding to the enhanced greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>Aerosols may also affect the number, density and size of cloud droplets. This 
  may change the amount and optical properties of clouds, and hence their reflection 
  and absorption. It may also have an impact on the formation of precipitation. 
  As discussed in <a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a>, these are potentially important 
  indirect effects of aerosols, resulting probably in a negative radiative forcing 
  of as yet very uncertain magnitude.</p>
<p><i>Land-use change</i><br>
  The term "land-use change" refers to a change in the use or management 
  of land. Such change may result from various human activities such as changes 
  in agriculture and irrigation, deforestation, reforestation and afforestation, 
  but also from urbanisation or traffic. Land-use change results in changing the 
  physical and biological properties of the land surface and thus the climate 
  system.</p>
<p>It is now recognized that land-use change on the present scale may contribute 
  significantly to changing the local, regional or even global climate and moreover 
  has an important impact on the carbon cycle. Physical processes and feedbacks 
  caused by land-use change, that may have an impact on the climate, include changes 
  in albedo and surface roughness, and the exchange between land and atmosphere 
  of water vapour and greenhouse gases. These climatic consequences of land-use 
  change are discussed and evaluated in <a href="289.htm">Section 4</a> of <a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>. Land-use change may also affect the climate system through biological 
  processes and feedbacks involving the terrestrial vegetation, which may lead 
  to changes in the sources and sinks of carbon in its various forms. <a href="095.htm">Chapter 
  3</a> reviews the consequences for the carbon cycle. Obviously the combined 
  effect of these physical and biogeochemical processes and feedbacks is complex, 
  but new data sets and models start to shed light on this.</p>
<p>Urbanisation is another kind of land-use change. This may affect the local 
  wind climate through its influence on the surface roughness. It may also create 
  a local climate substantially warmer than the surrounding countryside by the 
  heat released by densely populated human settlements, by changes in evaporation 
  characteristics and by modifying the outgoing long-wave radiation through interception 
  by tall buildings etc. This is known as an "urban heat island". The 
  influence on the regional climate may be noticeable but small. It may however 
  have a significant influence on long instrumental temperature records from stations 
  affected by expanding urbanisation. The consequences of this urbanisation effect 
  for the global surface temperature record has been the subject of debate. It 
  is discussed in <a href="052.htm#222">Section 2.2.2</a> of <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>.</p>
<p><i>Climate response</i><br>
  The increase in greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere 
  and also land-use change produces a radiative forcing or affects processes and 
  feedbacks in the climate system. As discussed in <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>, 
  the response of the climate to these human-induced forcings is complicated by 
  such feedbacks, by the strong non-linearity of many processes and by the fact 
  that the various coupled components of the climate system have very different 
  response times to perturbations. Qualitatively, an increase of atmospheric greenhouse 
  gas concentrations leads to an average increase of the temperature of the surface-troposphere 
  system. The response of the stratosphere is entirely different. The stratosphere 
  is characterised by a radiative balance between absorption of solar radiation, 
  mainly by ozone, and emission of infrared radiation mainly by carbon dioxide. 
  An increase in the carbon dioxide concentration therefore leads to an increase 
  of the emission and thus to a cooling of the stratosphere.</p>
<p>The only means available to quantify the non-linear climate response is by 
  using numerical models of the climate system based on well-established physical, 
  chemical and biological principles, possibly combined with empirical and statistical 
  methods.</p>
