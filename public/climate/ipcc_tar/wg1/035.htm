      <b>Figure 25:</b> Projected CO<sub>2</sub> emissions permitting stabilisation 
      of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations at different final values. 
      Panel <b>(a)</b> shows the assumed trajectories of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
      (WRE scenarios) and panels<b> (b)</b> and <b>(c)</b> show the implied CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions, as projected with two fast carbon cycle models, Bern-CC and ISAM. 
      The model ranges for ISAM were obtained by tuning the model to approximate 
      the range of responses to CO<sub>2</sub> and climate from model intercomparisons. 
      This approach yields a lower bound on uncertainties in the carbon cycle 
      response. The model ranges for Bern-CC were obtained by combining different 
      bounding assumptions about the behaviour of the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation 
      effect, the response of heterotrophic respiration to temperature and the 
      turnover time of the ocean, thus approaching an upper bound on uncertainties 
      in the carbon cycle response. For each model, the upper and lower bounds 
      are indicated by the top and bottom of the shaded area. Alternatively, the 
      lower bound (where hidden) is indicated by a hatched line. [Based on <a href="124.htm#fig313">Figure

<h2>F.10 Projections of Future Changes in Response to CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration 
  Stabilisation Profiles</h2>
<a name="greenhouse"></a> 
<h3>Greenhouse gases and aerosols</h3>
<p><i>All of the stabilisation profiles studied require CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  to eventually drop well below current levels.</i> Anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emission rates that arrive at stable CO<sub>2</sub> concentration levels from 
  450 to 1,000 ppm were deduced from the prescribed CO<sub>2</sub> profiles (<a href="#figTechSum25">Figure 
  25a</a>). The results (<a href="#figTechSum25">Figure 25b</a>) are not substantially 
  different from those presented in the SAR; however, the range is larger, mainly 
  due to the range of future terrestrial carbon uptake caused by different assumptions 
  in the models. Stabilisation at 450, 650 or 1,000 ppm would require global anthropogenic 
  emissions to drop below 1990 levels within a few decades, about a century, or 
  about two centuries, respectively, and continue to steadily decrease thereafter. 
  Although there is sufficient uptake capacity in the ocean to incorporate 70 
  to 80% of foreseeable anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the atmosphere, 
  this process takes centuries due to the rate of ocean mixing. As a result, even 
  several centuries after emissions occurred, about a quarter of the increase 
  in concentration caused by these emissions is still present in the atmosphere. 
  To maintain constant CO<sub>2</sub> concentration beyond 2300 requires emissions 
  to drop to match the rate of carbon sinks at that time. Natural land and ocean 
  sinks with the capacity to persist for hundreds or thousands of years are small 
  (&lt;0.2 PgC/yr).</p>
<a name="temperature"></a> 
<h3>Temperature</h3>
<i>Global mean temperature continues to increase for hundreds of years at a rate 
of a few tenths of a degree per century after concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> 
have been stabilised, due to long time-scales in the ocean.</i> The temperature 
implications of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration profiles leading to stabilisation 
from 450 ppm to 1,000 ppm were studied using a simple climate model tuned to seven 
AOGCMs with a mean climate sensitivity of 2.8&deg;C. For all the pathways leading 
to stabilisation, the climate system shows considerable warming during the 21st 
century and beyond (see <a href="#figTechSum26">Figure 26</a>). The lower the 
level at which concentrations stabilise, the smaller the total temperature change.<br>
<a name="sea"></a> 
<h3>Sea level</h3>
<i>If greenhouse gas concentrations were stabilised (even at present levels), 
sea level would nonetheless continue to rise for hundreds of years. </i>After 
500 years, sea level rise from thermal expansion may have reached only half of 
its eventual level, which models suggest may lie within a range of 0.5 to 2.0 
m and 1 to 4 m for CO<sub>2</sub> levels of twice and four times pre-industrial, 
respectively. The long time-scale is characteristic of the weak diffusion and 
slow circulation processes that transport heat into the deep ocean. 
<p><i>The loss of a substantial fraction of the total glacier mass is likely.</i> 
  Areas that are currently marginally glaciated are most likely to become ice-free.</p>
<p><i>Ice sheets will continue to react to climatic change during the next several 
  thousand years, even if the climate is stabilised.</i> Together, the present 
  Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets contain enough water to raise sea level by 
  almost 70 m if they were to melt, so that only a small fractional change in 
  their volume would have a significant effect.</p>
<p><i>Models project that a local annual average warming of larger than 3&deg;C, 
  sustained for millennia, would lead to virtually a complete melting of the Greenland 
  ice sheet with a resulting sea level rise of about 7 m.</i> Projected temperatures 
  over Greenland are generally greater than globally averaged temperatures by 
  a factor of 1.2 to 3.1 for the range of models used in <a href="408.htm">Chapter 
  11</a>. For a warming over Greenland of 5.5&deg;C, consistent with mid-range 
  stabilisation scenarios (see <a href="#figTechSum26">Figure 26</a>), 
  the Greenland ice sheet is likely to contribute about 3 m in 1,000 years. For 
  a warming of 8&deg;C, the contribution is about 6 m, the ice sheet being largely 
  eliminated. For smaller warmings, the decay of the ice sheet would be substantially 
  slower (see <a href="#figTechSum27">Figure 27</a>).</p>
<p><i>Current ice dynamic models project that the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) 
  will contribute no more than 3 mm/yr to sea level rise over the next thousand 
  years, even if significant changes were to occur in the ice shelves.</i> Such 
  results are strongly dependent on model assumptions regarding climate change 
  scenarios, ice dynamics and other factors. Apart from the possibility of an 
  internal ice dynamic instability, surface melting will affect the long-term 
  viability of the Antarctic ice sheet. For warmings of more than 10&ordm;C, simple 
  runoff models predict that a zone of net mass loss would develop on the ice 
  sheet surface. Irreversible disintegration of the WAIS would result because 
  the WAIS cannot retreat to higher ground once its margins are subjected to surface 
  melting and begin to recede. Such a disintegration would take at least a few 
  millennia. Thresholds for total disintegration of the East Antarctic ice sheet 
  by surface melting involve warmings above 20&ordm;C, a situation that has not 
  occurred for at least 15 million years and which is far more than predicted 
  by any scenario of climate change currently under consideration.</p>
