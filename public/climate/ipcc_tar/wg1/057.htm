<p>Most of the warming in the 20th century occurred in two 
  distinct periods separated by several decades of little overall globally averaged 
  change, as objectively identified by Karl et al. (2000) and discussed in IPCC 
  (1990, 1992, 1996) and several references quoted therein. <a href="057.htm#fig29">Figures 
  2.9</a> and <a href="#fig210">2.10</a> highlight the worldwide behaviour 
  of temperature change in the three periods. These linear trends have been calculated 
  from the Jones et al. (2001) gridded combination of UKMO SST and CRU land-surface 
  air temperature, from which the trends in <a href="053.htm#tab22">Table 2.2</a> 
  were calculated. Optimum averaging has not been used for <a href="057.htm#fig29">Figures 
  2.9</a> and <a href="#fig210">2.10</a>, and only trends for grid boxes 
  where reasonably complete time-series of data exist are shown. The periods chosen 
  are 1910 to 1945 (first warming period), 1946 to 1975 (period of little global 
  temperature change), 1976 to 2000 (second warming period, where all four seasons 
  are shown in <a href="#fig210">Figure 2.10</a>) and the 20th century, 
  1901 to 2000. It can be seen that there is a high degree of local consistency 
  between the SST and land air temperature across the land-ocean boundary, noting 
  that the corrections to SST (Folland and Parker, 1995) are independent of the 
  land data. The consistency with which this should be true locally is not known 
  physically, but is consistent with the similarity of larger-scale coastal land 
  and ocean surface temperature anomalies on decadal time-scales found by Parker 
  et al. (1995). The warming observed in the period from 1910 to 1945 was greatest 
  in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, as discussed in Parker et al. (1994). 
  By contrast, the period from 1946 to 1975 shows widespread cooling in the Northern 
  Hemisphere relative to much of the Southern, consistent with <a href="053.htm#tab21">Tables 
  2.1</a> and <a href="053.htm#tab22">2.2</a> and Parker et al. (1994). Much of 
  the cooling was seen in the Northern Hemisphere regions that showed most warming 
  in 1910 to 1945 (<a href="#fig29">Figure 2.9</a> and Parker et al., 1994). 
  In accord with the results in the SAR, recent warming (1976 to 2000) has been 
  greatest over the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere continents in winter. However, 
  the updated data shows only very limited areas of year-round cooling in the 
  north-west North Atlantic and mid-latitude North Pacific. Over 1901 to 2000 
  as a whole, noting the strong consistency across the land-ocean boundary, most 
  warming is observed over mid- and high latitude Asia and parts of western Canada. 
  The only large areas of observed cooling are just south and east of Greenland 
  and in a few scattered continental regions in the tropics and sub-tropics. <br>
  <br>
  Faster warming of the land-surface temperature than the ocean surface temperature 
  in the last two decades, evident in <a href="056.htm#fig26">Figure 2.6</a>, 
  could in part be a signal of anthropogenic warming (see <a href="338.htm">Chapters 
  9</a> and <a href="439.htm">12</a>). However, a component, at least in the Northern 
  Hemisphere north of 40 to 45&deg;N, may result from the sharp increase in the 
  positive phase of the winter half year North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)/Arctic 
  Oscillation (AO) since about 1970 (<a href="086.htm#265">Section 2.6.5</a>), 
  though this itself might have an anthropogenic component (<a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>). There has also been a strong bias to the warm phase of El Ni&ntilde;o 
  since about 1976 (<a href="083.htm#262">Section 2.6.2</a>). In particular, Hurrell 
  and van Loon (1997) and Thompson et al. (2000a) show that the positive phase 
  of the NAO advects additional warm air over extra-tropical Eurasia north of 
  about 45&deg;N. The positive phase of the NAO or AO is therefore likely to be 
  a major cause of the winter half-year warming in Siberia and northern Europe 
  in <a href="#fig210">Figure 2.10</a>, as also quantified by Hurrell (1996). 
  Cooling over the western North Atlantic Ocean also occurs, partly due to advection 
  of cold air in an enhanced north to north-west airflow. Hurrell (1996) also 
  shows that the warm phase of El Ni&ntilde;o is associated with widespread extra-tropical 
  continental warming, particularly over North America and parts of Siberia, with 
  cooling over the North Pacific Ocean. Both effects are consistent with the strong 
  warming over Siberia in winter in 1976 to 2000 (<a href="#fig210">Figure 
  2.10</a>), warming over much of North America and cooling over the Davis Strait 
  region. Note that some regional details of the seasonal trends for 1976 to 2000 
  in <a href="#fig210">Figure 2.10</a> may be sensitive to small changes 
  in record length. A test for the shorter period 1980 to 1997 showed the same 
  general worldwide pattern of (generally somewhat reduced) seasonal warming trends 
  as in <a href="#fig210">Figure 2.10</a>, but with some regional changes, 
  particularly over North America, almost certainly related to atmospheric circulation 
  fluctuations. However, Siberian trends were considerably more robust.</p>
<p>We conclude that in the 20th century we have seen a consistent large-scale 
  warming of the land and ocean surface. Some regional details can be explained 
  from accompanying atmospheric circulation changes.<br>
