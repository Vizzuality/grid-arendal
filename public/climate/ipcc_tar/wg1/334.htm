<h3>8.8.1 Extreme Temperature</h3>
<p>Analysis of extreme temperature in climate model simulations has concentrated 
  on the surface daily maximum and minimum temperature, or on the duration of 
  hot/cold spells on the global scale (Schubert, 1998; Zwiers and Kharin, 1998; 
  McGuffie et al., 1999; Kharin and Zwiers, 2000).</p>
<p>Zwiers and Kharin (1998) and Kharin and Zwiers (2000) analysed the 20-year 
  return values for daily maximum and minimum screen temperature simulated by 
  both CCC GCM2 and CGCM1. Comparison with the NCEP reanalyses shows that the 
  model reproduced the return values of both maximum and minimum temperature and 
  warm/cold spells reasonably well.</p>
<p>Intercomparisons among five AGCMs for the return values of extreme temperature 
  of &lt;-20&deg;C and &gt;40&deg;C over the globe show a reasonable level of 
  agreement between the models in terms of global scale variability (McGuffie 
  et al., 1999).</p>
<h3><a name="882"></a>8.8.2 Extreme Precipitation</h3>
<p>Analysis of extreme precipitation simulated by climate models has included 
  the daily variability of anomalous precipitation (Zwiers and Kharin, 1998; McGuffie 
  et al., 1999; Kharin and Zwiers, 2000), patterns of heavy rainfall (Bhaskran 
  and Mitchell, 1998; Zhao et al., 2000b), as well as wet and dry spells (Thorncroft 
  and Rowell, 1998; McGuffie et al., 1999). The results show some agreement with 
  the available observations but the comparatively low model resolution is an 
  inhibiting factor.</p>
<p>Ideally the simulated extreme rainfall should be compared with grided data 
  calculated from the observed station data; however, observed grided data comparable 
  to those produced by the models are scarce. Therefore, often the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis 
  data are used as an "observed" data set despite the fact that this 
  data set does not appear to reproduce daily variability well (Zwiers and Kharin, 
  1998). Another issue is the interpretation of precipitation simulated by a climate 
  model, some authors treat simulated precipitation as grid-box averages; others 
  argue that it should be treated as grid-point values (Zwiers and Kharin, 1998). 
  Hennessy et al. (1997) compared the daily precipitation by both CSIRO and UKHI 
  (United Kingdom High-Resolution) AGCMs coupled to mixed-layer ocean models. 
  They found that simulated frequencies of daily precipitation were close to those 
  for grid-box average observations.</p>
<p>In summary, in contrast with the simulations of extreme temperature by climate 
  models, extreme precipitation is difficult to reproduce, especially for the 
  intensities and patterns of heavy rainfall which are heavily affected by the 
  local scale (see <a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>).</p>
<h3><a name="883"></a>8.8.3 Extra-tropical Storms</h3>
<p>Analyses of occurrences and tracks of extra-tropical storms have been performed 
  for some climate models (Lunkeit et al., 1996; Beersma et al., 1997; Carnell 
  and Senior, 1998; Schubert et al., 1998; Zwiers and Kharin, 1998; Kharin and 
  Zwiers, 2000). However, very different methods are used to characterise extra-tropical 
  storms, among the methods used are: mid-latitude storm tracks defined by 1,000 
  hPa wind speed (Zwiers and Kharin, 1998), maximum eddy growth rate at 350 hPa 
  and 775 hPa (Lunkeit et al., 1996), index of storm tracks (such as 500 hPa height 
  variability, sea level pressure, surface wind) (Beersma et al., 1997), frequency, 
  intensity and track of 500 hPa transient eddies (Schubert et al., 1998), as 
  well as low centres at 500 hPa (Carnell and Senior, 1998).</p>
<p>Kaurola (1997) compared the numbers of the observed extra-tropical storms north 
  of 30&deg;N for five winter seasons and from a 30-year simulation of the ECHAM3 
  atmospheric model for two periods during the control run. The comparisons indicated 
  that the ratios of total numbers between the simulations and observations were 
  0.96 and 0.97 for two respective periods. It appears that the ECHAM3 model is 
  able to simulate the numbers of storms north of 30&deg;N in wintertime. The 
  mid-latitude storm tracks over the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and over 
  the southern circumpolar ocean were also well simulated by the CCC GCM2 (Zwiers 
  and Kharin, 1998).</p>
<p>Kageyama et al. (1999) focused on the storm tracks of the Northern Hemisphere 
  as simulated by several AGCMs. Intercomparisons of the nine AGCMs show that 
  the models reproduce reasonably the storm tracks defined with high-pass second-order 
  transient eddy quantities. These results also indicated that higher resolution 
  models tend to be better at reproducing the storm tracks.</p>
<p>Schubert et al. (1998) analysed North Atlantic storms in the ECHAM3/LSG model. 
  Their analysis indicated that the storm frequency, position and density agreed 
  with the observations. Lunkeit et al. (1996) analysed storm activity in the 
  ECHAM2/OPYC model. They found that the mean eddy activity and storm tracks in 
  that simulation were in reasonable agreement with observations.</p>
<p>The general ability of models to simulate extra-tropical storms and storm tracks 
  is most encouraging.</p>
<h3><a name="884"></a>8.8.4 Tropical Cyclones</h3>
<p>Tropical cyclones can be characterised in models by several measures such as 
  their intensity, track, frequency and location of occurrence (Bengtsson et al., 
  1996; Sugi et al., 1997; Tsutsui et al., 1999). Other broad-scale fields such 
  as maximum wind speed, maximum potential intensity (Holland, 1997) and high 
  sea surface temperature (Hulme and Viner, 1998) are also used as indicators 
  of tropical cyclones. Thus it is important to consider the particular characteristics 
  that are used to describe tropical cyclones in a given analysis when results 
  from models are compared (Henderson-Sellers et al., 1998; Krishnamurti et al., 
  1998; Royer et al., 1998; Walsh and Pittock, 1998).</p>
<p>Many analyses have been based on the physical parameters favourable for cyclogenesis 
  as summarised by Gray (1981). Gray relates the climatological frequency of tropical 
  cyclone genesis to six environmental factors: (1) large values of low-level 
  relative vorticity, (2) Coriolis parameter (at least a few degrees poleward 
  of the equator), (3) weak vertical shear of the horizontal winds, (4) high SST's 
  exceeding 26&deg;C and a deep thermocline, (5) conditional instability through 
  a deep atmospheric layer, and (6) large values of relative humidity in the lower 
  and middle troposphere (Gray, 1981; Henderson-Sellers et al., 1998). Following 
  the general concepts outlined by Emanuel (1987), Holland (1997) has derived 
  an alternative thermodynamic approach to estimate maximum potential intensity 
  of tropical cyclones. The approach requires an atmosphere sounding, SST, and 
  surface pressure; it includes the oceanic feedback of increasing moist entropy 
  associated with falling surface pressure over a steady SST, and explicitly incorporates 
  a representation of the cloudy eye wall and a clear eye.</p>
<p>Several climate model simulations in <a href="333.htm#tab84">Table 8.4</a> 
  have been analysed using a variety of the above techniques to determine the 
  frequency of tropical cyclones (Bengtsson et al., 1995; Watterson et al., 1995; 
  Vitart et al., 1997; Royer et al., 1998). The ECHAM3 model has by far the highest 
  horizontal resolution amongst these models. The numbers of simulated tropical 
  cyclones are between 70 and 141 per year. The numbers of observed tropical cyclones 
  per year are quite variable; 80 for the period 1958 to 1977 (Gray, 1979), 99 
  for the period 1952 to 1971 (Gray, 1975) and 86 for the period of 1970 to 1995 
  (Henderson-Sellers et al., 1998). Despite the differing definitions of tropical 
  cyclones used in the different analyses, the range of tropical cyclones numbers 
  simulated by the models are similar to the observed data.</p>
<p>Bengtsson et al. (1995; 1996; 1999) have analysed a five-year simulation with 
  ECHAM3 at T106 (100 km) horizontal resolution. They conclude that the model 
  could reproduce some aspects of the characteristic structure of tropical cyclones 
  and some aspects of their geographical distribution and seasonal variability. 
  They also found that in certain areas, in particular in the north-east Pacific, 
  a realistic number of tropical cyclones was only generated by the model when 
  the horizontal resolution was finer than 100 km. Their results showed a reasonably 
  good agreement with the observed distribution, tracks and annual variability 
  of tropical cyclones (Bengtsson et al., 1995, 1999). Sugi et al. (1997) and 
  Yoshimura et al. (1999) used a 100 km version of the JMA AGCM and compared the 
  simulated geographical distribution of tropical cyclones with observations. 
  They obtained reasonably realistic geographical patterns. However, in contrast 
  to the observations, they did not find a significant difference in tropical 
  cyclone frequency when they used the SSTs representing El Ni&ntilde;o and La 
  Ni&ntilde;a years.</p>
<p>Henderson-Sellers et al. (1998) suggested that AOGCMs could provide useful 
  information of the frequency of tropical cyclones, but the models they studied 
  all had coarse resolution (about 500 km), climate drift (or flux adjustment) 
  and unproven skill for present day tropical cyclones. A first attempt of tropical 
  cyclones simulations with a high-resolution coupled climate model was performed 
  by Matsuura et al. (1999) with a 100 km JMA atmospheric model coupled with the 
  GFDL modular ocean model (MOM2) (0.5&deg;31.0&deg;) model (but without sea ice). 
  This model reproduced some aspects of the structure of observed tropical cyclones, 
  although the simulated "tropical cyclones" are weaker and larger in 
  scale than the observed. The model also shows the observed tendency of less 
  (more) frequent tropical cyclones and an eastward (westward) shift of their 
  locations over the northwestern equatorial Pacific during El Ni&ntilde;o (La 
  Ni&ntilde;a) years. This result gives us some confidence in using a high-resolution 
  coupled climate model in the future to explore the relationship between global 
  warming and the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones.</p>
<p>In summary, high horizontal resolution AGCMs (or AOGCMs) are able to simulate 
  some aspects of "tropical cyclone-like vortices" with some degree 
  of success, but it is still too computationally expensive to use such models 
  for long experiments. The type of tropical cyclone index chosen in the analysis 
  of low-resolution climate models is important, the use of maximum potential 
  intensity may provide the most robust estimate, but analyses using this index 
  remain infrequent.</p>
<h3><a name="885"></a>8.8.5 Summary and Discussion</h3>
<p>Since the SAR, more attention has been paid to the analysis of extreme events 
  in climate model simulations. Evaluations indicate that climate models are more 
  capable of reproducing the variability in maximum and minimum temperature in 
  the global scale than the daily precipitation variability. The ability of climate 
  models to simulate extra-tropical storm tracks and storm frequency is encouraging. 
  When tropical cyclones were analysed, high-resolution models generally produced 
  better results. It is worth noting that some high-resolution operational numerical 
  weather prediction models have demonstrated reasonable ability in forecasting 
  tropical cyclones. This increases our confidence that they may be better reproduced 
  by high-resolution climate models in the future.</p>
<p>The lack of consistent methodologies used in analyses of extreme events prevents 
  a ready intercomparison of results between models; future IPCC assessments would 
  be greatly assisted if common approaches were adopted. </p>
