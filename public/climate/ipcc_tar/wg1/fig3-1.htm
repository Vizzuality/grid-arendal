<i> <!-- #BeginEditable "Page_Content_Here" --><b>Figure 3.1:</b> The global carbon 
cycle: storages (PgC) and fluxes (PgC/yr) estimated for the 1980s. (a) Main components 
of the natural cycle. The thick arrows denote the most important fluxes from the 
point of view of the contemporary CO<sub>2</sub> balance of the atmosphere: gross 
primary production and respiration by the land biosphere, and physical air-sea 
exchange. These fluxes are approximately balanced each year, but imbalances can 
affect atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration significantly over years to centuries. 
The thin arrows denote additional natural fluxes (dashed lines for fluxes of carbon 
as CaCO3), which are important on longer time-scales. The flux of 0.4 PgC/yr from 
atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> via plants to inert soil carbon is approximately balanced 
on a time-scale of several millenia by export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) 
in rivers (Schlesinger, 1990). A further 0.4 PgC/yr flux of dissolved inorganic 
carbon (DIC) is derived from the weathering of CaCO3, which takes up CO<sub>2</sub> 
from the atmosphere in a 1:1 ratio. These fluxes of DOC and DIC together comprise 
the river transport of 0.8 PgC/yr. In the ocean, the DOC from rivers is respired 
and released to the atmosphere, while CaCO3 production by marine organisms results 
in half of the DIC from rivers being returned to the atmosphere and half being 
buried in deep-sea sediments - which are the precursor of carbonate rocks. Also 
shown are processes with even longer time-scales: burial of organic matter as 
fossil organic carbon (including fossil fuels), and outgassing of CO<sub>2</sub> 
through tectonic processes (vulcanism). Emissions due to vulcanism are estimated 
as 0.02 to 0.05 PgC/yr (Williams et al., 1992; Bickle, 1994). (b) The human perturbation 
(data from Table 3.1). Fossil fuel burning and land-use change are the main anthropogenic 
processes that release CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. Only a part of this CO<sub>2</sub> 
stays in the atmosphere; the rest is taken up by the land (plants and soil) or 
by the ocean. These uptake components represent imbalances in the large natural 
two-way fluxes between atmosphere and ocean and between atmosphere and land. (c) 
Carbon cycling in the ocean. CO<sub>2</sub> that dissolves in the ocean is found 
in three main forms (CO<sub>2</sub>, CO32-, HCO3-, the sum of which is DIC). DIC 
is transported in the ocean by physical and biological processes. Gross primary 
production (GPP) is the total amount of organic carbon produced by photosynthesis 
(estimate from Bender et al., 1994); net primary production (NPP) is what is what 
remains after autotrophic respiration, i.e., respiration by photosynthetic organisms 
(estimate from Falkowski et al., 1998). Sinking of DOC and particulate organic 
matter (POC) of biological origin results in a downward flux known as export production 
(estimate from Schlitzer, 2000). This organic matter is tranported and respired 
by non-photosynthetic organisms (heterotrophic respiration) and ultimately upwelled 
and returned to the atmosphere. Only a tiny fraction is buried in deep-sea sediments. 
Export of CaCO3 to the deep ocean is a smaller flux than total export production 
(0.4 PgC/yr) but about half of this carbon is buried as CaCO3 in sediments; the 
other half is dissolved at depth, and joins the pool of DIC (Milliman, 1993). 
Also shown are approximate fluxes for the shorter-term burial of organic carbon 
and CaCO3 in coastal sediments and the re-dissolution of a part of the buried 
CaCO3 from these sediments. (d) Carbon cycling on land. By contrast with the ocean, 
most carbon cycling through the land takes place locally within ecosystems. About 
half of GPP is respired by plants. The remainer (NPP) is approximately balanced 
by heterotrophic respiration with a smaller component of direct oxidation in fires 
(combustion). Through senescence of plant tissues, most of NPP joins the detritus 
pool; some detritus decomposes (i.e., is respired and returned to the atmosphere 
as CO<sub>2</sub>) quickly while some is converted to modified soil carbon, which 
decomposes more slowly. The small fraction of modified soil carbon that is further 
converted to compounds resistant to decomposition, and the small amount of black 
carbon produced in fires, constitute the "inert" carbon pool. It is 
likely that biological processes also consume much of the "inert" carbon 
as well but little is currently known about these processes. Estimates for soil 
carbon amounts are from Batjes (1996) and partitioning from Schimel et al. (1994) 
and Falloon et al. (1998). The estimate for the combustion flux is from Scholes 
and Andreae (2000). &#145;t' denotes the turnover time for different components 
of soil organic matter.<!-- #EndEditable --> </i>
