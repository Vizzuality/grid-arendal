<h2>6.2.2 Strengths and Limitations of the Forcing Concept</h2>
<p>Radiative forcing continues to be a useful concept, providing a convenient 
  first-order measure of the relative climatic importance of different agents 
  (SAR; Shine and Forster, 1999). It is computationally much more efficient than 
  a GCM calculation of the climate response to a specific forcing; the simplicity 
  of the calculation allows for sophisticated, highly accurate radiation schemes, 
  yielding accurate forcing estimates; the simplicity also allows for a relative 
  ease in conducting model intercomparisons; it yields a first-order perspective 
  that can then be used as a basis for more elaborate GCM investigations; it potentially 
  bypasses the complex tasks of running and analysing equilibrium-response GCM 
  integrations; it is useful for isolating errors and uncertainties due to radiative 
  aspects of the problem.</p>
<p>In gauging the relative climatic significance of different forcings, an important 
  question is whether they have similar climate sensitivities. As discussed in 
  <a href="216.htm#621">Section 6.2.1</a>, while models indicate a reasonable 
  similarity of climate sensitivities for spatially homogeneous forcings (e.g., 
  CO<sub>2</sub> changes, solar irradiance changes), it is not possible as yet 
  to make a generalisation applicable to all the spatially inhomogeneous forcing 
  types. In some cases, the climate sensitivity differs significantly from that 
  for CO<sub>2</sub> changes while, for some other cases, detailed studies have 
  yet to be conducted. A related question is whether the linear additivity concept 
  mentioned above can be extended to include all of the relevant forcings, such 
  that the sum of the responses to the individual forcings yields the correct 
  total climate response. As stated above, such tests have been conducted only 
  for limited subsets of the relevant forcings. </p>
<p>Another important limitation of the concept is that there are parameters other 
  than global mean surface temperature that need to be determined, and that are 
  as important from a climate and societal impacts perspective; the forcing concept 
  cannot provide estimates for such climate parameters as directly as for the 
  global mean surface temperature response. There has been considerably less research 
  on the relationship of the equilibrium response in such parameters as precipitation, 
  ice extent, sea level, etc., to the imposed radiative forcing.</p>
<p>Although the radiative forcing concept was originally formulated for the global, 
  annual mean climate system, over the past decade, it has been extended to smaller 
  spatial domains (zonal mean), and smaller time-averaging periods (seasons) in 
  order to deal with short-lived species that have a distinct geographical and 
  seasonal character, e.g., aerosols and O<sub>3</sub> (see also the SAR). The 
  global, annual average forcing estimate for these species masks the inhomogeneity 
  in the problem such that the anticipated global mean response (via <a href="216.htm#equ61">Equation 
  6.1</a>) may not be adequate for gauging the spatial pattern of the actual climate 
  change. For these classes of radiative perturbations, it is incorrect to assume 
  that the characteristics of the responses would be necessarily co-located with 
  the forcing, or that the magnitudes would follow the forcing patterns exactly 
  (e.g., Cox et al., 1995; Ramaswamy and Chen, 1997b).</p>
