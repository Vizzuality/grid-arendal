<h2>8.2 What is Meant by Evaluation? </h2>
<h3><a name="821"></a>8.2.1 The Approach: Mean State and Variability in Climate 
  Models</h3>
<p>In this chapter, we (as the authors of this chapter) have attempted a two-pronged 
  approach to evaluation. As is traditional, we discuss how well models simulate 
  the mean seasonal climate for a number of variables (i.e., the average for a 
  given season taken over many simulated years). Since the characterisation of 
  a climate state includes its variability, we also describe simulated climate 
  variability over a range of time-scales. In addition, we discuss aspects of 
  the variability in the behaviour of specific phenomena. Evaluation of the performance 
  of global models in specific geographical regions is the subject of <a href="373.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>.</p>
<p>We use a wide range of "observations" in order to evaluate models. 
  However, often the most useful source for a particular variable is a product 
  of one of the reanalysis projects (most commonly that of the National Centers 
  for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) (Kalnay et al., 1996) or from the European 
  Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (Gibson et al., 1997)). Although 
  products from a data assimilation system are not direct "observations" 
  (they are the outcome of a combination of observed and model data), the global 
  grided nature and high time resolution of these products makes them extremely 
  useful when their accuracy is not in question. Some additional useful products 
  from reanalysis are not, in fact, the result of a direct combination of observed 
  and model data but are in fact the outcome of model integration and hence must 
  be used with caution. It is important to note that the various variables available 
  are not all of the same quality and, especially for data-sparse regions, implicitly 
  contain contributions from the errors in the underlying model (see also <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>). The overall quality of reanalysis products is continually assessed at 
  regular International Reanalysis Workshops.</p>
<h3><a name="822"></a>8.2.2 The Basis </h3>
<p>Recent discussions by Randall and Wielicki (1997), Shackley et al. (1998 and 
  1999), Henderson-Sellers and McGuffie (1999) and Petersen (2000) illustrate 
  many of the confusions and uncertainties that accompany attempts to evaluate 
  climate models especially when such models become very complex. We recognise 
  that, unlike the classic concept of Popper (1982), our evaluation process is 
  not as clear-cut as a simple search for "falsification". While we 
  do not consider that the complexity of a climate model makes it impossible to 
  ever prove such a model "false" in any absolute sense, it does make 
  the task of evaluation extremely difficult and leaves room for a subjective 
  component in any assessment. The very complexity of climate models means that 
  there are severe limits placed on our ability to analyse and understand the 
  model processes, interactions and uncertainties (Rind, 1999). It is always possible 
  to find errors in simulations of particular variables or processes in a climate 
  model. What is important to establish is whether such errors make a given model 
  "unusable" in answering specific questions.</p>
<p>Two fundamentally different ways are followed to evaluate models. In the first, 
  the important issues are the degree to which a model is physically based and 
  the degree of realism with which essential physical and dynamical processes 
  and their interactions have been modelled. This first type of evaluation is 
  undertaken in <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>. (We discuss the related aspects 
  of the numerical formulation and numerical resolution in <a href="335.htm">Section 
  8.9</a>.) In the second, there are attempts to quantify model errors, to consider 
  the causes for those errors (where possible) and attempts to understand the 
  nature of interactions within the model. We fully recognise that many of the 
  evaluation statements we make contain a degree of subjective scientific perception 
  and may contain much "community" or "personal" knowledge 
  (Polanyi, 1958). For example, the very choice of model variables and model processes 
  that are investigated are often based upon the subjective judgement and experience 
  of the modelling community.</p>
<p>The aim of our evaluation process is to assess the ability of climate models 
  to simulate the climate of the present and the past. Wherever possible we will 
  be concentrating on coupled models, however, where necessary we will examine 
  the individual model components. This assessment then acts as a guide to the 
  capabilities of models used for projections of future climate.</p>
