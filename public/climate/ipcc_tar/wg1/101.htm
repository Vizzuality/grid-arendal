<h4>3.2.2.3 Effects of climate</h4>
<p>Solar radiation, temperature and available water affect photo-synthesis, plant 
  respiration and decomposition, thus climate change can lead to changes in NEP. 
  A substantial part of the interannual variability in the rate of increase of 
  CO<sub>2</sub> is likely to reflect terrestrial biosphere responses to climate 
  variability (<a href="112.htm">Section 3.5.3</a>). Warming may increase NPP 
  in temperate and arctic ecosystems where it can increase the length of the seasonal 
  and daily growing cycles, but it may decrease NPP in water-stressed ecosystems 
  as it increases water loss. Respiratory processes are sensitive to temperature; 
  soil and root respiration have generally been shown to increase with warming 
  in the short term (Lloyd and Taylor, 1994; Boone et al., 1998) although evidence 
  on longer-term impacts is conflicting (Trumbore, 2000; Giardina and Ryan, 2000; 
  Jarvis and Linder, 2000). Changes in rainfall pattern affect plant water availability 
  and the length of the growing season, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. 
  Cloud cover can be beneficial to NPP in dry areas with high solar radiation, 
  but detrimental in areas with low solar radiation. Changing climate can also 
  affect the distribution of plants and the incidence of disturbances such as 
  fire (which could increase or decrease depending on warming and precipitation 
  patterns, possibly resulting under some circumstances in rapid losses of carbon), 
  wind, and insect and pathogen attacks, leading to changes in NBP. The global 
  balance of these positive and negative effects of climate on NBP depends strongly 
  on regional aspects of climate change.</p>
<p>The climatic sensitivity of high northern latitude ecosystems (tundra and taiga) 
  has received particular attention as a consequence of their expanse, high carbon 
  density, and observations of disproportionate warming in these regions (Chapman 
  and Walsh, 1993; Overpeck et al., 1997). High-latitude ecosystems contain about 
  25% of the total world soil carbon pool in the permafrost and the seasonally-thawed 
  soil layer. This carbon storage may be affected by changes in temperature and 
  water table depth. High latitude ecosystems have low NPP, in part due to short 
  growing seasons, and slow nutrient cycling because of low rates of decomposition 
  in waterlogged and cold soils. Remotely sensed data (Myneni et al., 1997) and 
  phenological observations (Menzel and Fabian, 1999) independently indicate a 
  recent trend to longer growing seasons in the boreal zone and temperate Europe. 
  Such a trend might be expected to have increased annual NPP. A shift towards 
  earlier and stronger spring depletion of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has also 
  been observed at northern stations, consistent with earlier onset of growth 
  at mid- to high northern latitudes (Manning, 1992; Keeling et al., 1996a; Randerson, 
  1999). However, recent flux measurements at individual high-latitude sites have 
  generally failed to find appreciable NEP (Oechel et al., 1993; Goulden et al., 
  1998; Schulze et al., 1999; Oechel et al., 2000). These studies suggest that, 
  at least in the short term, any direct effect of warming on NPP may be more 
  than offset by an increased respiration of soil carbon caused by the effects 
  of increased depth of soil thaw. Increased decomposition, may, however also 
  increase nutrient mineralisation and thereby indirectly stimulate NPP (Melillo 
  et al., 1993; Jarvis and Linder, 2000; Oechel et al., 2000).</p>
<p>Large areas of the tropics are arid and semi-arid, and plant production is 
  limited by water availability. There is evidence that even evergreen tropical 
  moist forests show reduced GPP during the dry season (Malhi et al., 1998) and 
  may become a carbon source under the hot, dry conditions of typical El Ni&ntilde;o 
  years. With a warmer ocean surface, and consequently generally increased precipitation, 
  the global trend in the tropics might be expected to be towards increased NPP, 
  but changing precipitation patterns could lead to drought, reducing NPP and 
  increasing fire frequency in the affected regions.</p>
