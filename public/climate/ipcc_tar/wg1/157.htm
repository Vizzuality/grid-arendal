<h3>4.5.2 Impacts of Physical Climate Change on Atmospheric Chemistry</h3>
<p>As global warming increases in the next century, the first-order atmospheric 
  changes that impact tropospheric chemistry are the anticipated rise in temperature 
  and water vapour. For example, an early 2-D model study (Fuglestvedt et al., 
  1995) reports that tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> decreases by about 10% in response 
  to a warmer, more humid climate projected for year 2050 as compared to an atmosphere 
  with current temperature and H<sub>2</sub>O. A recent study based on NCAR (National 
  Center for Atmospheric Research) CCM (Community Climate Model) projected year 
  2050 changes in tropospheric temperature and H<sub>2</sub>O (Brasseur et al., 
  1998a) finds a global mean 7% increase in the OH abundance and a 5% decrease 
  in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>, again relative to the same calculation with the 
  current physical climate.</p>
<p>A 3-D tropospheric chemistry model has been coupled to the Hadley Centre Atmosphere-Ocean 
  General Circulation Model (AOGCM) and experiments performed using the SRES preliminary 
  marker A2p emissions (i) as annual snapshots (Stevenson et al., 2000) and (ii) 
  as a 110-year, fully coupled experiment (Johnson et al., 1999) for the period 
  1990 to 2100. By 2100, the experiments with coupled climate change have increases 
  in CH<sub>4</sub> which are only about three-quarters those of the simulation 
  without climate change and increases in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude O<sub>3</sub> 
  which are reduced by half. The two major climate-chemistry feedback mechanisms 
  identified in these and previous studies were (1) the change of chemical reaction 
  rates with the average 3&deg;C increase in tropospheric temperatures and (2) 
  the enhanced photochemical destruction of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> with the 
  approximately 20% increase in water vapour. The role of changes in the circulation 
  and convection appeared to play a lesser role but have not been fully evaluated. 
  These studies clearly point out the importance of including the climate-chemistry 
  feedbacks, but are just the beginning of the research that is needed for adequate 
  assessment.</p>
<p>Thunderstorms, and their associated lightning, are a component of the physical 
  climate system that provides a direct source of a key chemical species, NO<sub>x</sub>. 
  The magnitude and distribution of this lightning NO<sub>x</sub> source controls 
  the magnitude of the anthropogenic perturbations, e.g., that of aviation NO<sub>x</sub> 
  emissions on upper tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> (Berntsen and Isaksen, 1999). 
  In spite of thorough investigations of the vertical distribution of lightning 
  NO<sub>x</sub> (Huntrieser et al., 1998; Pickering et al. 1998), uncertainty 
  in the source strength of lightning NO<sub>x</sub> cannot be easily derived 
  from observations (Thakur et al., 1999; Thompson et al., 1999). The link of 
  lightning with deep convection (Price and Rind, 1992) opens up the possibility 
  that this source of NO<sub>x</sub> would vary with climate change, however, 
  no quantitative evaluation can yet be made. </p>
<h3><a name="453"></a>4.5.3 Feedbacks through Natural Emissions</h3>
Natural emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> are currently the dominant 
contributors to their respective atmospheric burdens, with terrestrial emissions 
greatest in the tropics. Emissions of both of these gases are clearly driven by 
changes in physical climate as seen in the ice-core record (<a href="134.htm#fig41">Figure 
4.1e</a>). Soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions are sensitive to temperature and soil 
moisture and changes in rates of carbon and nitrogen cycling (Prinn et al., 1999). 
Similarly, methane emissions from wetlands are sensitive to the extent of inundation, 
temperature rise, and changes in rates of carbon and nitrogen cycling. Natural 
emissions of the pollutants NO<sub>x</sub>, CO, and VOC play an important role 
in production of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> and the abundance of OH; and these 
emissions are subject to similar forcings by both the physical and chemical climates. 
Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in turn respond to near-surface pollution (O<sub>3</sub>, 
NO<sub>2</sub>, acidic gases and aerosols) and to inadvertent fertilisation through 
deposition of reactive nitrogen (often emitted from the biosphere as NO or NH<sub>3</sub>). 
This response can take the form of die back, reduced growth, or changed species 
composition competition that may alter trace gas surface exchange and ecosystem 
health and function. The coupling of this feedback system - between build-up 
of greenhouse gases, human-induced climate change, ecosystem responses, trace 
gas exchange at the surface, and back to atmospheric composition - has not 
been evaluated in this assessment. The variety and complexity of these feedbacks 
relating to ecosystems, beyond simple increases with rising temperatures and changing 
precipitation, argues strongly for the full interactive coupling of biogeochemical 
models of trace gas emissions with chemistry and climate models.<br>
