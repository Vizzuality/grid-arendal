<h2>C.2 Observed Changes in Other Radiatively Important Gases</h2>
<a name="o3"></a>
<h3>Atmospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)</h3>
<i>Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is an important greenhouse gas present in both the stratosphere 
and troposphere.</i> The role of ozone in the atmospheric radiation budget is 
strongly dependent on the altitude at which changes in ozone concentrations occur. 
The changes in ozone concentrations are also spatially variable. Further, ozone 
is not a directly emitted species, but rather it is formed in the atmosphere from 
photochemical processes involving both natural and human-influenced precursor 
species. Once formed, the residence time of ozone in the atmosphere is relatively 
short, varying from weeks to months. As a result, estimation of ozone's radiative 
role is more complex and much less certain than for the above long-lived and globally 
well-mixed greenhouse gases.<br>
<p><i>The observed losses of stratospheric ozone layer over the past two decades 
  have caused a negative forcing of 0.15 &plusmn; 0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (i.e., a 
  tendency toward cooling) of the surface troposphere system.</i> It was reported 
  in Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, 
  that depletion of the ozone layer by anthropogenic halocarbons introduces a 
  negative radiative forcing. The estimate shown in <a href="015.htm#figTechSum9">Figure 
  9</a> is slightly larger in magnitude than that given in the SAR, owing to the 
  ozone depletion that has continued over the past five years, and it is more 
  certain as a result of an increased number of modelling studies. Studies with 
  General Circulation Models indicate that, despite the inhomogeneity in ozone 
  loss (i.e., lower stratosphere at high latitudes), such a negative forcing does 
  relate to a surface temperature decrease in proportion to the magnitude of the 
  negative forcing. Therefore, this negative forcing over the past two decades 
  has offset some of the positive forcing that is occurring from the long-lived 
  and globally well-mixed greenhouse gases (<a href="015.htm#figTechSum9">Figure 
  9</a>). A major source of uncertainty in the estimation of the negative forcing 
  is due to incomplete knowledge of ozone depletion near the tropopause. Model 
  calculations indicate that increased penetration of ultraviolet radiation to 
  the troposphere, as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion, leads to enhanced 
  removal rates of gases like CH<sub>4</sub>, thus amplifying the negative forcing 
  due to ozone depletion. As the ozone layer recovers in future decades because 
  of the effects of the Montreal Protocol, relative to the present, future radiative 
  forcing associated with stratospheric ozone is projected to become positive.</p>
<p><i>The global average radiative forcing due to increases in tropospheric ozone 
  since pre-industrial times is estimated to have enhanced the anthropogenic greenhouse 
  gas forcing by 0.35 &plusmn; 0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup>.</i> This makes tropospheric 
  ozone the third most important greenhouse gas after CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. 
  Ozone is formed by photochemical reactions and its future change will be determined 
  by, among other things, emissions of CH<sub>4</sub> and pollutants (as noted 
  below). Ozone concentrations respond relatively quickly to changes in the emissions 
  of pollutants. On the basis of limited observations and several modelling studies, 
  tropospheric ozone is estimated to have increased by about 35% since the Pre-industrial 
  Era, with some regions experiencing larger and some with smaller increases. 
  There have been few observed increases in ozone concentrations in the global 
  troposphere since the mid-1980s at most of the few remote locations where it 
  is regularly measured. The lack of observed increase over North America and 
  Europe is related to the lack of a sustained increase in ozone-precursor emissions 
  from those continents. However, some Asian stations indicate a possible rise 
  in tropospheric ozone, which could be related to the increase in East Asian 
  emissions. As a result of more modelling studies than before, there is now an 
  increased confidence in the estimates of tropospheric ozone forcing. The confidence, 
  however, is still much less than that for the well-mixed greenhouse gases, but 
  more so than that for aerosol forcing. Uncertainties arise because of limited 
  information on pre-industrial ozone distributions and limited information to 
  evaluate modelled global trends in the modern era (i.e., post-1960).</p>

<h3>Gases with only indirect radiative influences</h3>
Several chemically reactive gases, including reactive nitrogen species (NO<sub>x</sub>), 
carbon monoxide (CO), and the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), control, in part, 
the oxidising capacity of the troposphere, as well as the abundance of ozone. 
These pollutants act as indirect greenhouse gases through their influence not 
only on ozone, but also on the lifetimes of CH<sub>4</sub> and other greenhouse gases. The 
emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> and CO are dominated by human activities.<br>
<p><i>Carbon monoxide is identified as an important indirect greenhouse gas.</i> 
  Model calculations indicate that emission of 100 Mt of CO is equivalent in terms 
  of greenhouse gas perturbations to the emission of about 5 Mt of CH<sub>4</sub>. 
  The abundance of CO in the Northern Hemisphere is about twice that in the Southern 
  Hemisphere and has increased in the second half of the 20th century along with 
  industrialisation and population.</p>
<p><i>The reactive nitrogen species NO and NO<sub>2</sub>, (whose sum is denoted 
  NO<sub>x</sub>), are key compounds in the chemistry of the troposphere, but 
  their overall radiative impact remains difficult to quantify.</i> The importance 
  of NO<sub>x</sub> in the radiation budget is because increases in NO<sub>x</sub> concentrations 
  perturb several greenhouse gases; for example, decreases in methane and the 
  HFCs and increases in tropospheric ozone. Deposition of the reaction products 
  of NO<sub>x</sub> fertilises the biosphere, thereby decreasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. 
  While difficult to quantify, increases in NO<sub>x</sub> that are projected 
  to the year 2100 would cause significant changes in greenhouse gases.</p>
