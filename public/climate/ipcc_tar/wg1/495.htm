<h4>13.5.2.2 Defining climate change signals</h4>
<p>The question of signal-to-noise ratios in climate model simulations was alluded 
  to above, and has also been discussed in <a href="338.htm">Chapters 9</a> and 
  <a href="439.htm">12</a>. The treatment of "signal" and "noise" 
  in constructing climate scenarios is of great importance in interpreting the 
  results of impact assessments that make use of these scenarios. If climate scenarios 
  contain an unspecified combination of signal plus noise, then it is important 
  to recognise that the impact response to such scenarios will only partly be 
  a response to anthropogenic climate change; an unspecified part of the impact 
  response will be related to natural internal climate variability. However, if 
  the objective is to specify the impacts of the anthropogenic climate signal 
  alone, then there are two possible strategies for climate scenario construction: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>attempt to maximise the signal and minimise the noise;</li>
  <li>do not try to disentangle signal from noise, but supply impact assessments 
    with climate scenarios containing both elements and also companion descriptions 
    of future climate that contain only noise, thus allowing impact assessors 
    to generate their own impact signal-to-noise ratios (Hulme et al., 1999a).</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="fig138"></a>The relative strength of the signal-to-noise ratio can 
  be demonstrated in a number of ways. Where response patterns are reasonably 
  stable over time, this ratio can be maximised in a climate change scenario by 
  using long (30-year or more) averaging periods. Alternatively, regression or 
  principal component techniques may be used to extract the signal from the model 
  response (Hennessy et al., 1998). A third technique is to use results from multi-member 
  ensemble simulations, as first performed by Cubasch et al. (1994). Sampling 
  theory shows that in such simulations the noise is reduced by a factor of <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/sqrt.gif" width="8" height="14">(n), 
  where n is the ensemble size. Using results from the HadCM2 four-member ensemble 
  experiments, Giorgi and Francisco (2000), for example, suggest that uncertainty 
  in future regional climate change associated with internal climate variability 
  at sub-continental scales (10<sup>7</sup> km<sup>2</sup>), is generally smaller 
  than the uncertainty associated with inter-model or forcing differences. This 
  conclusion is scale- and variable-dependent, however (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>, <a href="349.htm#fig94">Figure 9.4</a>; see also R&auml;is&auml;nen, 
  1999), and the inverse may apply at the smaller scales (10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> 
  km<sup>2</sup>) at which many impact assessments are conducted. Further work 
  is needed on resolving this issue for climate scenario construction purposes.</p>
<p>A different way of maximising the climate change signal is to compare the responses 
  of single realisations from experiments completed using different models. If 
  the error for different models is random with zero mean, then sampling theory 
  shows that this model average will yield a better estimate of the signal than 
  any single model realisation. This approach was first suggested in the context 
  of climate scenarios by Santer et al. (1990) and is illustrated further in <a href="338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>, <a href="346.htm">Section 9.2.2</a>. Treating different GCM simulations 
  in this way, i.e., as members of a multi-model ensemble, is one way of defining 
  a more robust climate change signal, either for use in pattern-scaling techniques 
  or directly in constructing a climate scenario. The approach has been discussed 
  by R&auml;is&auml;nen (1997) and used recently by Wigley (1999), Hulme and Carter 
  (2000; see <a href="#fig138">Figure 13.8</a>) and Carter et al. (2000b) in providing 
  regional characterisations of the SRES emissions scenarios. </p>
<p>The second strategy requires that the noise component be defined explicitly. 
  This can be done by relying either on observed climate data or on model-simulated 
  natural climate variability (Hulme et al., 1999a; Carter et al., 2000b). Neither 
  approach is ideal. Observed climate data may often be of short duration and 
  therefore yield a biased estimate of the noise. Multi-decadal internal climate 
  variability can be extracted from multi-century unforced climate simulations 
  such as those performed by a number of modelling groups (e.g., Stouffer et al., 
  1994; Tett et al., 1997; von Storch et al., 1997). In using AOGCM output in 
  this way, it is important not only to demonstrate that these unforced simulations 
  do not drift significantly (Osborn, 1996), but also to evaluate the extent to 
  which model estimates of low-frequency variability are comparable to those estimated 
  from measured climates (Osborn et al., 2000) or reconstructed palaeoclimates 
  (Jones et al., 1998). Furthermore, anthropogenic forcing may alter the character 
  of multi-decadal climate variability and therefore the noise defined from model 
  control simulations may not apply in the future. </p>
