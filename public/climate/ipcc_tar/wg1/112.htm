<h3>3.5.3 Inverse Modelling of Carbon Sources and Sinks </h3>

      <b>Figure 3.5:</b> Inverse model estimates of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> 
      uptake by latitude bands according to eight models using different techniques 
      and sets of atmospheric observations (results summarised by Heimann, 2001). 
      Positive numbers denote fluxes to the atmosphere; negative numbers denote 
      uptake from the atmosphere. The ocean-atmosphere fluxes represent mainly 
      the natural carbon cycle; the land-atmosphere fluxes may be considered as 
      estimates of the uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> by the land (with 
      some caveats as discussed in the text). The sum of land-atmosphere and ocean-atmosphere 
      fluxes is shown because it is somewhat better constrained by observations 
      than the separate fluxes, especially for the 1980s when the measurement 
      network was less extensive than it is today. The 1990s are represented by 
      the period 1990 to 1996 only, because when this exercise was carried out 
      the modelling groups did not have access to all of the necessary data for 
      more recent years.</td>

<p><a name="fig35"></a>Inverse modelling attempts to resolve regional patterns 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and release from observed spatial and temporal patterns 
  in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, sometimes also taking into consideration 
  O<sub>2</sub> and/or <img src="images/delta-s.gif" width="8" height="10"><sup>13</sup>C 
  measurements. The most robust results are for the latitudinal partitioning of 
  sources and sinks between northern and southern mid- to high latitudes and the 
  tropics. The observed annual mean latitudinal gradient of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration during the last 20 years is relatively large (about 3 to 4 ppm) 
  compared with current measurement accuracy. It is however not as large as would 
  be predicted from the geographical distribution of fossil fuel burning a fact that suggests the existence of a northern sink for CO<sub>2</sub>, as 
  already recognised a decade ago (Keeling et al., 1989; Tans et al., 1990; Enting 
  and Mansbridge, 1991).</p>
<p>The nature of this sink, however, cannot be determined from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration measurements alone. It might reflect, at least in part, a natural 
  source-sink pattern of oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes (Keeling et al., 1989; Broecker and 
  Peng, 1992). This view is supported by the early atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  data from the 1960s (Bolin and Keeling, 1963) which do not show a clear latitudinal 
  gradient, despite the fact that at that time the fossil emissions were already 
  at least half as large as in the 1990s. Quantitative analysis shows that the 
  Northern Hemisphere sink has not changed much in magnitude since the 1960s (Keeling 
  et al., 1989; Fan et al., 1999). On the other hand, the existing air-sea flux 
  measurements do not support the idea of a large oceanic uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  in the Northern Hemisphere (Tans et al., 1990; Takahashi, 1999). An alternative 
  view, therefore, locates a significant fraction of this Northern Hemisphere 
  sink on land. This view is corroborated, at least for the 1990s, by analyses 
  of the concurrent latitudinal gradients of <img src="images/delta-s.gif" width="8" height="10"><sup>13</sup>C 
  (Ciais et al., 1995a,b) and O<sub>2</sub> (Keeling et al., 1996b).</p>
<p>Results of analyses for the 1980s and 1990 to 1996, carried out by eight modelling 
  groups using different atmospheric transport models, observational data, constraints 
  and mathematical procedures, are summarised in Figure 3.5. Only the most robust 
  findings, i.e., estimates of the mean carbon balance for three latitude bands 
  averaged over the two time periods, are shown. The latitude bands are: "southern 
  extratropics" (&gt;30&deg;S), "tropics" (30&deg;S to 30&deg;N) 
  and "northern extratropics" (&gt;30&deg;N). The carbon balance estimates 
  are broken down into land and ocean compartments within each latitude band (Heimann, 
  2001).</p>
<p>Although the ranges of the estimates in <a href="#fig35">Figure 3.5</a> limit 
  the precision of any inference from these analyses, some clear features emerge. 
  The inferred ocean uptake pattern shows the sum of two components: the natural 
  carbon cycle in which CO<sub>2</sub> is outgassed in the tropics and taken up 
  in the extratropics, and the perturbation uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>. 
  Separation of these two components cannot be achieved from atmospheric measurements 
  alone.</p>
<p>The estimates for the land, on the other hand, in principle indicate the locations 
  of terrestrial anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake (albeit with caveats listed 
  below). For 1980 to 1989, the inverse-model estimates of the land-atmosphere 
  flux are -2.3 to -0.6 PgC/yr in the northern extratropics and -1.0 to +1.5 PgC/yr 
  in the tropics. These estimates imply that anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> was 
  taken up both in the northern extratropics and in the tropics (balancing deforestation), 
  as illustrated in <a href="#fig36">Figure 3.6</a>. The estimated land-atmosphere 
  flux in the southern extratropics is estimated as close to zero, which is expected 
  given the small land area involved. Estimates of CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes for the 
  period 1990 to 1996 show a general resemblance to those for the 1980s. For 1990 
  to 1996, the inverse-model estimates of the land-atmosphere flux are -1.8 to 
  -0.7 PgC/yr in the northern extratropics and -1.3 to +1.1 PgC/yr in the tropics. 
  These results suggest a tendency towards a reduced land-atmosphere flux in the 
  tropics, compared to the 1980s. Such a trend could be produced by reduced deforestation, 
  increased CO<sub>2</sub> uptake or a combination of these.</p>
<p>Inverse modelling studies usually attempt greater spatial resolution of sources 
  and sinks than is presented in this section. However, there are large unresolved 
  differences in longitudinal patterns obtained by inverse modelling, especially 
  in the northern hemisphere and in the tropics (Enting et al., 1995, Law et al., 
  1996; Fan et al., 1998; Rayner et al., 1999a; Bousquet et al., 1999; Kaminski 
  et al., 1999). These differences may be traced to different approaches and several 
  difficulties in inverse modelling of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (Heimann and 
  Kaminski, 1999):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The longitudinal variations in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration reflecting net 
    surface sources and sinks are on annual average typically &lt;1 ppm. Resolution 
    of such a small signal (against a background of seasonal variations up to 
    15 ppm in the Northern Hemisphere) requires high quality atmospheric measurements, 
    measurement protocols and calibration procedures within and between monitoring 
    networks (Keeling et al., 1989; Conway et al., 1994).</li>
  <li>Inverse modelling results depend on the properties of the atmospheric transport 
    models used. The north-south transport of the models can be checked by comparing 
    simulations of the relatively well-known inert anthropogenic tracer SF<sub>6</sub> 
    with measured atmospheric concentrations of this tracer, as recently investigated 
    in the TRANSCOM intercomparison project (Denning et al., 1999). Unfortunately 
    there is no currently measured tracer that can be used to evaluate the models' 
    representation of longitudinal transport. Furthermore, the strong seasonality 
    of the terrestrial CO<sub>2</sub> flux in the Northern Hemisphere together 
    with covarying seasonal variations in atmospheric transport may induce significant 
    mean annual gradients in concentration which do not reflect net annual sources 
    and sinks, but which nevertheless have to be modelled correctly if inverse 
    model calculations are to be reliable (Bolin and Keeling, 1963; Heimann et 
    al., 1986; Keeling et al., 1989; Denning et al., 1995; Law et al., 1996). 
    Even the sign of this so-called "rectifier effect" is uncertain. 
    Some scientists believe that it may be responsible for a part of the apparent 
    Northern Hemisphere uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> implied by inverse modelling 
    results (Taylor, 1989; Taylor and Orr, 2000).</li>
  <li>The spatial partitioning of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake could also be distorted 
    by a few tenths of 1 PgC/yr because the atmospheric concentration gradients 
    also reflect the natural fluxes induced by weathering, transport of carbon 
    by rivers and subsequent outgassing from the ocean (see <a href="097.htm#fig31">Figure 
    3.1</a>) (Sarmiento and Sundquist, 1992; Aumont et al., 2001b). Furthermore, 
    the effects of atmospheric transport of carbon released as CO and CH<sub>4</sub> 
    (especially from incomplete fossil fuel burning, tropical biomass burning, 
    and CH<sub>4</sub> from tropical wetlands) with subsequent oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub> 
    is generally neglected. Their inclusion in the inversion leads to corrections 
    of the latitudinal partitioning of up to 0.1 PgC/yr (Enting and Mansbridge, 
    1991).</li>
  <li>The distribution of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> measurement stations (<a href="#fig37">Figure 
    3.7</a>) is uneven, and severely underrepresents the continents. This underrepresentation 
    is due in part to the problem of finding continental locations where measurements 
    will not be overwhelmed by local sources and sinks. </li>
  <li>Because of the finite number of monitoring stations, the mathematical inversion 
    problem is highly underdetermined. In principle a multitude of different surface 
    source/sink configurations are compatible with the atmospheric data, within 
    their measurement accuracy. Therefore, in order to extract a meaningful solution, 
    additional information on the sources and sinks has to be introduced into 
    the calculation. Examples of this additional information include maps of air-sea 
    fluxes from observations or ocean models, patterns of terrestrial CO<sub>2</sub> 
    exchanges inferred by terrestrial models, and remote sensing data. Thus, many 
    methodological choices about the use of auxiliary data can influence the outcome 
    of the analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interannual variability of climate is likely to strongly influence the spatial 
  distribution of CO<sub>2</sub> sources and sinks, so that analyses based on 
  a few years of data are insufficient to establish a long-term trend.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present atmospheric measurement network, current information 
  on air-sea fluxes and current understanding of vertical atmospheric transport 
  are not sufficient to allow full use of the potential of inverse modelling techniques 
  to infer geographically detailed source-sink distributions of anthropogenic 
  CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

            <b>Figure 3.6:</b> Partitioning the 1980s land-atmosphere flux for 
            the tropics and the northern extratropics. The residual terrestrial 
            sink in different latitude bands can be inferred by subtracting the 
            land-use change flux for the 1980s (estimated by modelling studies: 
            Houghton, 1999; Houghton and Hackler, 1999; Houghton et al., 2000; 
            McGuire et al., 2001) from the net land-atmosphere flux as obtained 
            from atmospheric observations by inverse modelling for the same period 
            (Heimann, 2001; results from <a href="#fig35">Figure 3.5</a>). Positive 
            numbers denote fluxes to the atmosphere; negative numbers denote uptake 
            from the atmosphere. This calculation is analogous to the global budget 
            calculation in <a href="097.htm#tab31">Table 3.1</a>, but now the 
            model results are broken down geographically and the land-atmosphere 
            fluxes are obtained by inverse modelling. The upper and lower bounds 
            on the residual sink are obtained by pairing opposite extremes of 
            the ranges of values accepted for the two terms in this calculation 
            (for example, by subtracting the bottom of the range of values for 
            land-use change with the top of the range for the land-atmosphere 
            flux). The mid-ranges are obtained by combining similar extremes (for 
            example, subtracting the bottom of the range for land-use change emissions 
            from the bottom of the range land-atmosphere flux).</td>
