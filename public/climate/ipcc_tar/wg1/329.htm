<h3>8.6.4 Climate of 20th Century: Summary </h3>
<p>Several coupled models are able to reproduce the major trend in 20th century 
  surface air temperature, when driven by historical radiative forcing scenarios 
  corresponding to the 20th century. However, in these studies idealised scenarios 
  of only sulphate radiative forcing have been used. One study using the ECHAM4/OPYC 
  model that includes both the indirect and direct effects of sulphate aerosols, 
  as well as changes in tropospheric ozone, suggests that the observed surface 
  and tropospheric air temperature discrepancies since 1979 are reduced when stratospheric 
  ozone depletion and stratospheric aerosols associated with the Pinatubo eruption 
  are included. Systematic evaluation of 20th century AOGCM simulations for other 
  trends found in observational fields, such as the reduction in diurnal temperature 
  range over the 20th century and the associated increase in cloud coverage, have 
  yet to be conducted.</p>
<p>The inclusion of changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosols has improved 
  the simulated variability found in several AOGCMs. In addition, some evaluation 
  studies aimed at the reproduction of 20th century climate have suggested that 
  changes in solar irradiance may be important to include in order to reproduce 
  the warming in the early part of the century. Another study has suggested that 
  this early warming can be solely explained as a consequence of natural internal 
  climate variability.</p>
<p>Taken together, we consider that there is an urgent need for a systematic 20th 
  century climate intercomparison project with a standard set of forcings, including 
  volcanic aerosols, changes in solar irradiance and land use, as well as a more 
  realistic treatment of both the direct and indirect effects of a range of aerosols.</p>
<h3><a name="865"></a>8.6.5 Commentary on Land Cover Change</h3>
<p>Land-cover change can occur through human intervention (land clearance), via 
  direct effects of changes in CO<sub>2</sub> on vegetation physiology and structure, and 
  via climate changes (<a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>). Evidence from observational 
  studies (see <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="291.htm">Section 7.4.2</a>) 
  and modelling studies (e.g., Betts et al., 1997, 2000; Chase et al., 2000; Zhao 
  et al., 2001) demonstrate that changes in land cover can have a significant 
  impact on the regional scale climate but suggestions that land clearance has 
  an impact on the global scale climate is currently speculative. Evidence from 
  palaeoclimate (<a href="316.htm">Section 8.5</a>) and modelling work (<a href="316.htm">Section 
  8.5</a> and <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="289.htm">Section 7.4</a>) 
  indicates that these changes in vegetation may lead to very significant local 
  and regional scale climate changes which, in some cases, may be equivalent to 
  those due to increasing CO<sub>2</sub> (Pitman and Zhao, 2000).</p>
<p>On time-scales of decades the impact of land cover change could significantly 
  influence the rate of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increase (<a href="095.htm">Chapter 3</a>), 
  the nature and extent of the physical climate system response, and ultimately, 
  the response of the biosphere to global change (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>). 
  Models currently under development that can represent changes in land cover 
  resulting from changes in climate and CO<sub>2</sub> should enable the simulations of these 
  processes in the future. If these models can be coupled with scenarios representing 
  human-induced changes in land cover over the next 50 to 100 years, the important 
  effects of land- cover change can be included in climate models. While the inclusion 
  of these models of the biosphere is not expected to change the global scale 
  response to increasing CO<sub>2</sub>, they may significantly effect the simulations of 
  local and regional scale change.</p>
