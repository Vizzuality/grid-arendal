<p>For this analysis the central value for the forcing was estimated using the 
  two-stream radiative transfer equation for a simple box model. Central values 
  for all parameters were used and error propagation was handled by a standard 
  Taylor expansion. Estimates of uncertainty associated with each parameter were 
  developed from a combination of literature estimates for emissions, model results 
  for determination of burdens, and atmospheric measurements for determination 
  of mass scattering and absorption coefficients and water uptake effects. While 
  such a simple approach has shortcomings ( e.g., it tacitly assumes both horizontal 
  and vertical homogeneity in such quantities as relative humidity, or at least 
  that mean values can well represent the actual distributions), it allows a specific 
  association of parameter uncertainties with their effects on forcing. With this 
  approach, the most important uncertainties for fossil fuel aerosols are the 
  upscatter fraction (or asymmetry parameter), the burden (which includes propagated 
  uncertainties in emissions), and the mass scattering efficiency. The most important 
  uncertainties for biomass aerosols are the single scattering albedo, the upscatter 
  fraction, and the burden (including the propagated uncertainties in emissions).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Preliminary estimates of aerosol concentrations have been made for future 
    scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several scenarios were explored which included future changes in anthropogenic 
  emissions, temperature, and wind speed. Changes in the biosphere were not considered. 
  Most models using present day meteorology show an approximate linear dependence 
  of aerosol abundance on emissions. Sulphate and black carbon aerosols can respond 
  in a non-linear fashion depending on the chemical parametrization used in the 
  model. Projected changes in emissions may increase the relative importance of 
  nitrate aerosols. If wind speeds increase in a future climate, as predicted 
  by several GCMs, then increased emissions of sea salt aerosols may represent 
  a significant negative climate feedback.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is now clear experimental evidence for the existence of a warm cloud 
    aerosol indirect effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The radiative forcing of aerosols through their effect on liquid- water clouds 
  consists of two parts: the 1st indirect effect (increase in droplet number associated 
  with increases in aerosols) and the 2nd indirect effect (decrease in precipitation 
  efficiency associated with increases in aerosols). The 1st indirect effect has 
  strong observational support. This includes a recent study that established 
  a link between changes in aerosols, cloud droplet number and cloud albedo (optical 
  depth). There is also clear observational evidence for an effect of aerosols 
  on precipitation efficiency. However, there is only limited support for an effect 
  of changes in precipitation efficiency on cloud albedo. Models which include 
  the second indirect effect find that it increases the overall indirect forcing 
  by a factor of from 1.25 to more than a factor of two. Precipitation changes 
  could be important to climate change even if their net radiative effect is small, 
  but our ability to assess the changes in precipitation patterns due to aerosols 
  is limited.</p>
<p> The response of droplet number concentration to increasing aerosols is largest 
  when aerosol concentrations are small. Therefore, uncertainties in the concentrations 
  of natural aerosols add an additional uncertainty of at least a factor of &plusmn;1.5 
  to calculations of indirect forcing. Because the pre-existing, natural size 
  distribution modulates the size distribution of anthropogenic mass there is 
  further uncertainty associated with estimates of indirect forcing.</p>
<p> A major challenge is to develop and validate, through observations and small-scale 
  modelling, parametrizations for GCMs of the microphysics of clouds and their 
  interactions with aerosols. Projections of a future indirect effect are especially 
  uncertain because empirical relationships between cloud droplet number and aerosol 
  mass may not remain valid for possible future changes in aerosol size distributions. 
  Mechanistic parametrizations have been developed but these are not fully validated.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An analysis of the contributions of the uncertainties in the different factors 
    needed to estimate indirect forcing of the first kind can be made. This analysis 
    leads to an overall uncertainty estimate for indirect forcing over Northern 
    Hemisphere marine regions by fossil fuel aerosols of 100% (or a range from 
    0 to -2.8 Wm<sup>-2</sup>).</li>
</ul>
<p>For this analysis the central value for the forcing was estimated using the 
  two stream radiative transfer equation for a simple box model. Central values 
  for all parameters were used and error propagation was handled as for the estimate 
  of direct forcing uncertainty. This estimate is less quantitative than that 
  for direct forcing because it is still difficult to estimate many of the para-meters 
  and the 2/3 uncertainty ranges are not firm. Moreover, several sources of uncertainty 
  could not be estimated or included in the analysis. With this approach, the 
  most important uncertainties are the determination of cloud liquid-water content 
  and vertical extent. The relationship between sulphate aerosol concentration 
  (with the propagated uncertainties from the burden calculation and emissions) 
  and cloud droplet number concentration is of near equal importance in determining 
  the forcing.</p>
