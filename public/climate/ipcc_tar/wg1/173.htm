<p> Two types of chemical interaction have recently been recognised that can reduce 
  the radiative impact of sulphate by causing some of it to condense onto larger 
  particles with lower scattering efficiencies and shorter atmospheric lifetimes. 
  The first is heterogeneous reactions of SO<sub>2</sub> on mineral aerosols (Andreae 
  and Crutzen, 1997; Li-Jones and Prospero, 1998; Zhang and Carmichael, 1999). 
  The second is oxidation of SO<sub>2</sub> to sulphate in sea salt-containing 
  cloud droplets and deliquesced sea salt aerosols. This process can result in 
  a substantial fraction of non-sea-salt sulphate to be present on large sea salt 
  particles, especially under conditions where the rate of photochemical H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> 
  production is low and the amount of sea salt aerosol surface available is high 
  (Sievering et al., 1992; O'Dowd, et al., 1997; Andreae et al., 1999).<br>
</p>
<p> Because the models used to estimate sulphate aerosol production differ in 
  the resolution and representation of physical processes and in the complexity 
  of the chemical schemes, estimates of the amount of sulphate aerosol produced 
  and its atmospheric burden are highly model-dependent. <a href="171.htm#tab54">Table 
  5.4</a> provides an overall model-based estimate of sulphate production and 
  <a href="172.htm#tab55">Table 5.5</a> emphasises the differences between different 
  models. All the models shown in <a href="172.htm#tab55">Table 5.5</a> include 
  anthropogenic and natural sources and consider at least three species, DMS, 
  SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, B and D consider more species 
  and have a more detailed representation of the gas-phase chemistry. C, F and 
  G include a more detailed representation of the aqueous phase processes. The 
  calculated residence times of SO<sub>2</sub>, defined as the global burden divided 
  by the global emission flux, range between 0.6 and 2.6 days as a result of different 
  deposition parametrizations. Because of losses due to SO<sub>2</sub> deposition, 
  only 46 to 82% of the SO<sub>2</sub> emitted undergoes chemical transformations 
  and forms sulphate. The global turnover time of sulphate is mainly determined 
  by wet removal and is estimated to be between 4 and 7 days. Because of the critical 
  role that precipitation scavenging plays in controlling sulphate lifetime, it 
  is important how well models predict vertical profiles.</p>
<p> The various models start with gaseous sulphur sources ranging from 80 to 130 
  TgS/yr, and arrive at SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> burdens 
  of 0.2 to 0.6 and 0.6 to 1.1 TgS, respectively. It is noteworthy that there 
  is little correlation between source strength and the resulting burden between 
  models. In fact, the model with the second-highest precursor source (B) has 
  the lowest SO<sub>2</sub> burden, and the model with the highest sulphate burden 
  (J) starts with a much lower precursor source than the model with the lowest 
  sulphate burden (E). <a href="168.htm#fig52">Figures 5.2(a)</a> and <a href="168.htm#fig52">(b)</a> 
  show the global distribution of sulphate aerosol production from anthropogenic 
  SO<sub>2</sub> and from natural sources (primarily DMS), respectively (see also 
  <a href="171.htm#tab54">Table 5.4</a>).<br>
  <br>
  The modelled production efficiency of atmospheric sulphate aerosol burden from 
  a given amount of precursors is expressed as P, the ratio between the global 
  sulphate burden to the global sulphur emissions per day. At the global scale, 
  this parameter varies between the models listed in <a href="172.htm#tab55">Table 
  5.5</a> by more than a factor of two, from 1.9 to 4.5 days. Within a given model, 
  the potential of a specific sulphur source to contribute to the global sulphate 
  burden varies strongly as a function of where and in what form sulphur is introduced 
  into the atmosphere. SO<sub>2</sub> from volcanoes (P=6.0 days) is injected 
  at higher altitudes, and DMS (P=3.1 days) is not subject to dry deposition and 
  can therefore be converted to SO<sub>2</sub> far enough from the ground to avoid 
  large deposition losses. In contrast, most anthropogenic SO<sub>2</sub> (P=0.8 
  to 2.9 days) is released near the ground and therefore much of it is lost by 
  deposition before oxidation can occur (Feichter et al., 1997; Graf et al., 1997). 
  Regional differences in the conversion potential of anthropogenic emissions 
  may be caused by the latitude-dependent oxidation capacity and by differences 
  in the precipitation regime. For the same reasons P exhibits a distinct seasonality 
  in mid- and high latitudes.</p>
<p> This comparison indicates that in addition to uncertainties in precursor source 
  strengths, which may be ranging from factors of about 1.3 (SO<sub>2</sub>) to 
  2 (DMS), the estimation of the production and deposition terms of sulphate aerosol 
  introduces an additional uncertainty of at least a factor of 2 into the prediction 
  of the sulphate burden. As the relationship between sulphur sources and resulting 
  sulphate load depends on numerous parameters, the conversion efficiency must 
  be expected to change with changing source patterns and with changing climate.<br>
</p>
<p> Sulphate in aerosol particles is present as sulphuric acid, ammonium sulphate, 
  and intermediate compounds, depending on the availability of gaseous ammonia 
  to neutralise the sulphuric acid formed from SO<sub>2</sub>. In a recent modelling 
  study, Adams et al. (1999) estimate that the global mean NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>/SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> 
  mole ratio is about one, in good agreement with available measurements. This 
  increases the mass of sulphate aerosol by some 17%, but also changes the hydration 
  behaviour and refractive index of the aerosol. The overall effects are of the 
  order of 10%, relatively minor compared with the uncertainties discussed above 
  (Howell and Huebert, 1998).</p>
