<h2>9.1 Introduction </h2>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to assess and quantify projections of possible 
  future climate change from climate models. A background of concepts used to 
  assess climate change experiments is presented in <a href="344.htm">Section 
  9.2</a>, followed by <a href="349.htm">Section 9.3</a> which includes results 
  from ensembles of several categories of future climate change experiments, factors 
  that contribute to the response of those models, changes in variability and 
  changes in extremes. <a href="370.htm">Section 9.4</a> is a synthesis of our 
  assessment of model projections of climate change.</p>
<p>In a departure from the organisation of the SAR, the assessment of regional 
  information derived in some way from global models (including results from embedded 
  regional high resolution models, downscaling, etc.) now appears in <a href="373.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="911"></a>9.1.1 Background and Recap of Previous Reports</h3>
<p>Studies of projections of future climate change use a hierarchy of coupled 
  ocean/atmosphere/sea-ice/land-surface models to provide indicators of global 
  response as well as possible regional patterns of climate change. One type of 
  configuration in this climate model hierarchy is an Atmospheric General Circulation 
  Model (AGCM), with equations describing the time evolution of temperature, winds, 
  precipitation, water vapour and pressure, coupled to a simple non-dynamic "slab" 
  upper ocean, a layer of water usually around 50 m thick that calculates only 
  temperature (sometimes referred to as a "mixed-layer model"). Such 
  air-sea coupling allows those models to include a seasonal cycle of solar radiation. 
  The sea surface temperatures (SSTs) respond to increases in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), 
  but there is no ocean dynamical response to the changing climate. Since the 
  full depth of the ocean is not included, computing requirements are relatively 
  modest so these models can be run to equilibrium with a doubling of atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub>. This model design was prevalent through the 1980s, and results from such 
  equilibrium simulations were an early basis of societal concern about the consequences 
  of increasing CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>However, such equilibrium (steady-state) experiments provide no information 
  on time-dependent climate change and no information on rates of climate change. 
  In the late 1980s, more comprehensive fully coupled global ocean/atmosphere/sea-ice/land-surface 
  climate models (also referred to as Atmosphere-Ocean Global Climate Models, 
  Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models or simply AOGCMs) began to be run 
  with slowly increasing CO<sub>2</sub>, and preliminary results from two such models appeared 
  in the 1990 IPCC Assessment (IPCC, 1990). </p>
<p>In the 1992 IPCC update prior to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro (IPCC, 
  1992), there were results from four AOGCMs run with CO<sub>2</sub> increasing at 1%/yr 
  to doubling around year 70 of the simulations (these were standardised sensitivity 
  experiments, and consequently no actual dates were attached). Inclusion of the 
  full ocean meant that warming at high latitudes was not as uniform as from the 
  non-dynamic mixed-layer models. In regions of deep ocean mixing in the North 
  Atlantic and Southern Oceans, warming was less than at other high latitude locations. 
  Three of those four models used some form of flux adjustment whereby the fluxes 
  of heat, fresh water and momentum were either singly or in some combination 
  adjusted at the air-sea interface to account for incompatibilities in the component 
  models. However, the assessment of those models suggested that the main results 
  concerning the patterns and magnitudes of the climate changes in the model without 
  flux adjustment were essentially the same as in the flux-adjusted models. </p>
<p>The most recent IPCC Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) 
  included a much more extensive collection of global coupled climate model results 
  from models run with what became a standard 1%/yr CO<sub>2</sub>-increase experiment. These 
  models corroborated the results in the earlier assessment regarding the time 
  evolution of warming and the reduced warming in regions of deep ocean mixing. 
  There were additional studies of changes in variability in the models in addition 
  to changes in the mean, and there were more results concerning possible changes 
  in climate extremes. Information on possible future changes of regional climate 
  was included as well.</p>
<p>The SAR also included results from the first two global coupled models run 
  with a combination of increasing CO<sub>2</sub> and sulphate aerosols for the 
  20th and 21st centuries. Thus, for the first time, models were run with a more 
  realistic forcing history for the 20th century and allowed the direct comparison 
  of the model's response to the observations. The combination of the warming 
  effects on a global scale from increasing CO<sub>2</sub> and the regional cooling 
  from the direct effect of sulphate aerosols produced a better agreement with 
  observations of the time evolution of the globally averaged warming and the 
  patterns of 20th century climate change. Subsequent experiments have attempted 
  to quantify and include additional forcings for 20th century climate (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>), with projected outcomes for those forcings in scenario integrations 
  into the 21st century discussed below. </p>
<p>In the SAR, the two global coupled model runs with the combination of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and direct effect of sulphate aerosols both gave a warming at mid-21st century 
  relative to 1990 of around 1.5&deg;C. To investigate more fully the range of 
  forcing scenarios and uncertainty in climate sensitivity (defined as equilibrium 
  globally averaged surface air temperature increase due to a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  see discussion in <a href="344.htm">Section 9.2</a> below) a simpler climate 
  model was used. Combining low emissions with low sensitivity and high emissions 
  with high sensitivity gave an extreme range of 1 to 4.5&deg;C for the warming 
  in the simple model at the year 2100 (assuming aerosol concentrations constant 
  at 1990-levels). These projections were generally lower than corresponding projections 
  in IPCC (1990) because of the inclusion of aerosols in the pre-1990 radiative 
  forcing history. When the possible effects of future changes of anthropogenic 
  aerosol as prescribed in the IS92 scenarios were incorporated this led to lower 
  projections of temperature change of between 1&deg;C and 3.5&deg;C with the 
  simple model. </p>
<p>Spatial patterns of climate change simulated by the global coupled models in 
  the SAR corroborated the IPCC (1990) results. With increasing greenhouse gases 
  the land was projected to warm generally more than the oceans, with a maximum 
  annual mean warming in high latitudes associated with reduced snow cover and 
  increased runoff in winter, with greatest warming at high northern latitudes. 
  Including the effects of aerosols led to a somewhat reduced warming in middle 
  latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and the maximum warming in northern high 
  latitudes was less extensive since most sulphate aerosols are produced in the 
  Northern Hemisphere. All models produced an increase in global mean precipitation 
  but at that time there was little agreement among models on changes in storminess 
  in a warmer world and conclusions regarding extreme storm events were even more 
  uncertain. </p>
