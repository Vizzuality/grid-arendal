<p><a name="fig930"></a>Storms not only have obvious effects on extremes of temperature 
  and precipitation, but also have severe impacts associated with wind, ocean 
  waves, etc. Due to model limitations in previous generations of global climate 
  models, until recently there have been few studies examining changes in extra-tropical 
  cyclones in a future climate. With the improved recent generation of global 
  climate models (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>), such studies are now becoming 
  more credible. An analysis of an ensemble of four future climate change experiments 
  using a global coupled model with increased CO<sub>2</sub> and sulphate aerosols showed 
  an increase in the number of deep low pressure systems in Northern Hemisphere 
  winter, while the number of weaker storms was reduced (Carnell and Senior, 1998). 
  Studies using different models show a similar change for both hemispheres (Sinclair 
  and Watterson, 1999) or for a study region limited to the North Atlantic (Knippertz 
  et al., 2000).</p>
<p>The reasons given for this common result are still under discussion. Carnell 
  and Senior (1998) ascribe it to a decrease in the mean meridional temperature 
  gradient in the future climate, with high latitudes warming more than low latitudes 
  (producing fewer storms), and greater latent heating in the moister atmosphere 
  (resulting in deeper lows). Sinclair and Watterson (1999) point to the reduced 
  mean sea level pressure and emphasise that vorticity as a measure of cyclone 
  strength does not increase. Knippertz et al.(2000) consider the increasing upper 
  tropospheric baroclinicity to be an important indicator of the change in surface 
  cyclone activity. They also detect an increasing number of strong wind events 
  in their simulation that can be assigned to the increasing number of deep lows. 
  Upper air storm track activity (defined as the standard deviation of the band 
  pass filtered 500 hPa height and related to the surface lows) has been found 
  to increase over the East Atlantic and Western Europe with rising greenhouse 
  gas forcing (such as seen in <a href="#fig930">Figure 9.30</a> from Ulbrich 
  and Christoph, 1999).</p>
<p>They related this increase to a change in the NAO (see discussion of possible 
  NAO changes in <a href="362.htm">Section 9.3.5.3</a>). Several studies have 
  tried to look at mechanisms of changes (e.g., Lunkeit et al., 1998). For example, 
  Christoph et al. (1997) identify a mid-winter suppression of the North Pacific 
  storm track in present day climate which they attribute to very strong upper 
  level winds at that time of year. In a 3xCO<sub>2</sub> climate model experiment, they 
  note that very intense upper level winds occur more often, thus producing a 
  more pronounced mid-winter suppression of the Pacific storm track.</p>
<p>Longer time-series from models have made the statistics more robust (e.g., 
  Carnell and Senior, 1998). High-resolution models may improve the representation 
  of storms, but the present experiments are mainly too short to provide indications 
  of significant changes (e.g., Beersma et al., 1997). As can be seen, there are 
  now a growing number of studies addressing possible changes in storm activity, 
  but in spite of an emerging common signal there remains uncertainty with respect 
  to the governing mechanisms.</p>
