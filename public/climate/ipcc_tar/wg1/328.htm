<p><a name="fig820"></a>Coupled model control runs have a general tendency to 
  underestimate the variability found in both the instrumental and palaeo-proxy 
  record, especially over the oceans (the converse is true over land when compared 
  to the instrumental record). With the exception of Santer et al. (2000), none 
  of the aforementioned simulations examined the potential climatic effects of 
  stratospheric aerosols associated with volcanic emissions. On the longer time-scales, 
  none of these studies included variability in solar forcing. Crowley (2000) 
  has estimated that changes in solar irradiance and volcanism may account for 
  between 41 and 64% of pre-industrial, decadal-scale surface air temperature 
  variations.</p>
<p>Cubasch et al. (1997) demonstrated that when solar variations were included 
  in the ECHAM3/LSG model, their simulation from 1700 through the 20th century 
  showed enhanced low-frequency variability associated with variability in solar 
  irradiance (see also Lean and Rind, 1998). The implication of climate change 
  detection and attribution studies (<a href="439.htm">Chapter 12</a>; Hegerl 
  et al., 1997; Tett et al., 1999) for the reproduction of 20th century climate 
  by AOGCMs, is that changes in solar irradiance may be important to include if 
  one wants to reproduce the warming in the early part of the century. As noted 
  earlier, it is conceivable that this early warming may also be solely a result 
  of natural internal climate variability (Delworth and Knutson, 2000). Energy 
  balance/upwelling diffusion climate models and Earth system models of intermediate 
  complexity, when forced with volcanic and solar variations for the past 400 
  years, capture the cooling associated with the Little Ice Age (Betrand et al., 
  1999; Crowley and Kim, 1999; Free and Robock, 1999), although they are not capable 
  of assessing regional climatic anomalies associated with local feedbacks or 
  changes in atmospheric dynamics. These same models produce the observed warming 
  of the past century when additionally forced with anthropogenic greenhouse gases 
  and aerosols.</p>
<p>Hansen et al. (1997) conducted a systematic study of the climate system response 
  to various radiative forcings for the period 1979 to 1995 (over which period 
  Nimbus 7 satellite data were available) using the Goddard Institute for Space 
  Studies (GISS) AGCM coupled to a mixed-layer ocean model. A series of ensemble 
  simulations, with each ensemble consisting of five experiments, were conducted 
  by cumulatively adding, one-by-one, radiative forcing effects due to stratospheric 
  aerosols (associated with volcanic emissions), decreases in upper level ozone, 
  increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gases, and changes in solar irradiance 
  (<a href="#fig820">Figure 8.20</a>). While changes in tropospheric aerosols, 
  either via direct or indirect effects, were not included in their calculations, 
  over the short record a reasonable agreement with observations was obtained. 
  Internal climate variability (e.g., the warming associated with the El Ni&ntilde;o 
  of 1983 and the cooling associated with the La Ni&ntilde;a of 1989 in <a href="#fig820">Figure 
  8.20</a>b,c) is not well resolved in the model. These experiments point out 
  that while solar irradiance changes caused minimal changes over the period (consistent 
  with the analysis of Hegerl et al., 1997; Tett et al., 1999), stratospheric 
  aerosols associated with volcanic emissions and changes in upper level ozone 
  are important components which need to be included if one hopes to accurately 
  reproduce the variations in the instrumental record.</p>
<p>Changing land-use patterns affect climate in several ways (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>, <a href="244.htm">Section 6.11</a>). While the impact of land-use changes 
  on radiative forcing is small (e.g., Hansen et al., 1998) changes in roughness, 
  soil properties and other quantities may be important (see <a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>, <a href="289.htm">Section 7.4</a>). Brovkin et al. (1999) demonstrated 
  that CLIMBER (Climate Biosphere Model) was able to capture the long-term trends 
  and slow modulation of the Mann et al. (1998) reconstruction of Northern Hemisphere 
  temperatures over the past 300 years provided changes in land-use patterns (as 
  well as changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and changing solar forcing) were taken into 
  account. Some recent model results suggest that land cover changes during this 
  century may have caused regional scale warming (Chase et al., 2000; Zhao et 
  al., 2001) but this remains to be examined with a range of climate models. </p>
