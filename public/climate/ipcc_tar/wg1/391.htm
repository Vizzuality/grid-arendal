<h4>10.5.1.2 Mean climate: Simulations using GCM boundary conditions</h4>
<p>Since the SAR, evaluation of RCMs driven by GCM simulations of current climate 
  has gained much attention (<a href="404.htm">Appendix 10.2</a>), as this is 
  the context in which many RCMs are used (e.g., for climate change experiments). 
  Errors introduced by the GCM representation of large-scale circulations are 
  transmitted to the RCM as, for example, clearly shown by Noguer et al. (1998). 
  However, since the SAR, regional biases of seasonal surface air temperature 
  and precipitation have been reduced and are mostly within 2&deg;C, and 50 to 
  60% of observations (with exceptions in all seasons), respectively (Giorgi and 
  Marinucci, 1996b; Noguer et al., 1998; Jones et al., 1999 for Europe; Giorgi 
  et al., 1998 for the continental USA; McGregor et al., 1998 for Southeast Asia; 
  Kato et al., 2001 for East Asia). The reduction of biases is due to both better 
  large-scale boundary condition fields and improved aspects of internal physics 
  and dynamics in the RCMs. <br>
  The regionally averaged biases in the nested RCMs are not necessarily smaller 
  than those in the driving GCMs. However, all the experiments mentioned above, 
  along with those of Leung et al. (1999a,b), Laprise et al. (1998), Christensen 
  et al. (1998) and Machenhauer et al. (1998) clearly show that the spatial patterns 
  produced by the nested RCMs are in better agreement with observations because 
  of the better representation of high-resolution topographical forcings and improved 
  land/sea contrasts. For example, in simulations over Europe and central USA, 
  Giorgi and Marinucci (1996a) and Giorgi et al. (1998) find correlation coefficients 
  between simulated and observed seasonally averaged precipitation in the range 
  of +0.53 to +0.87 in a nested RCM and -0.69 to +0.85 in the corresponding 
  driving GCM. </p>
<p>The role of the high-resolution forcing was clearly demonstrated in the study 
  of Noguer et al. (1998), which showed that the skill in simulating the mesoscale 
  component of the climate signal (Giorgi et al., 1994; Jones et al., 1995) was 
  little sensitive to the quality of the driving data (Noguer et al., 1998). On 
  the other hand, interactions between the large-scale driving data and high resolution 
  RCM forcings can have negative effects. In simulations over the European region 
  of Machenauer et al. (1998), the increased shelter due to the better-resolved 
  mountains in the RCMs caused an intensification of the GCM-simulated excessively 
  dry and warm summer conditions over south-eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Horizontal resolution is especially important for the simulation of the hydrologic 
  cycle. Christensen et al. (1998) showed that only at a very high resolution 
  do the mountain chains in Norway and Sweden become sufficiently well resolved 
  to yield a realistic simulation of the surface hydrology (<a href="#fig1010">Figure 
  10.10</a>). An alternative strategy is to utilise a sub-grid scale scheme capable 
  of resolving complex topographical features (Leung et al., 1999a). </p>
