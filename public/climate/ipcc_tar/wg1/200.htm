<p> The forcing calculations estimated from the models described by Boucher and 
  Lohmann (1995), Jones and Slingo (1996), Feichter et al. (1997), Kiehl et al. 
  (2000) and Rotstayn (1999) were performed as the difference between two simulations 
  with fixed sea surface temperatures. These calculations, therefore, allow some 
  feedback of the perturbation in the cloud albedo to both the dynamic fields 
  and to water vapour and cloud amount. By definition, these GCM forcing estimates 
  are therefore not strict radiative forcings, however, Rotstayn and Penner (2001) 
  have shown that for the first indirect effect the inclusion of the feedback 
  changes their forcing estimate by only about 10%. The other results are from 
  chemical transport models/GCMs that do not include any feedbacks.<br>
</p>
<p> All models in <a href="199.htm#tab511a">Table 5.11a</a> explicitly consider 
  only sulphate, except those of Chuang et al. (1997, 2000) and Iversen et al. 
  (2000). Five of the models in <a href="199.htm#tab511a">5.11a</a> use an empirical 
  method to relate N<sup>d</sup> to sulphate mass concentration, which implicitly 
  includes some effect of other industrial aerosol components (e.g., OC), and 
  their forcing estimates range from -0.4 to -1.8 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with a median 
  of -0.9 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. Chuang et al. (2000) and Iversen et al. (2000) use 
  mechanistic parametrizations to calculate N<sub>d</sub>. Chuang et al. (2000) 
  consider organic carbon, black carbon, sea salt and dust as well as sulphate. 
  The estimate of indirect forcing from Chuang et al. (1997) is for sulphate only 
  and that from Iversen et al. (2000) is for sulphate and BC. The range of the 
  forcing estimates for industrial aerosols from the models using the mechanistic 
  approaches for N<sub>d</sub> (-0.82 to -1.36 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) is similar to 
  that of the empirical methods. The inclusion of forcing by biomass aerosols 
  increases the total forcing to -1.85 Wm<sup>-2</sup> in the model of Chuang 
  et al. (2000).<br>
</p>
<p> The estimates of indirect forcing that include feedback to the liquid-water 
  path and cloud amount from changes in cloud microphysics and precipitation efficiency 
  range from -1.1 Wm<sup>-2 </sup>to -4.8 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (<a href="199.htm#tab511b">Table 
  5.11b</a>). Due to the nature of the calculation, these are not strict estimates 
  of radiative forcing, but as noted above, Rotstayn and Penner (2001) have shown 
  that the feedback effects are probably not significant so that these may be 
  viewed as estimates of forcing. The largest absolute value, that obtained by 
  Lohmann and Feichter (1997) using the Xu and Randall and the Beheng parametrization 
  schemes, is considered less realistic because the comparison of the short- and 
  long-wave cloud radiative fluxes with those from the Earth Radiation Budget 
  Experiment (ERBE) was relatively poor. The next highest value (-3.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  from Ghan et al., 2001b) was obtained with a model using a very simple cloud 
  cover para-metrization (full coverage if saturated and no coverage if unsaturated). 
  Thus, based on the present modelling, a more likely range for the combination 
  of the first and second indirect effects is -1.1 to -2.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. However, 
  this range only includes one model estimate for the effects of aerosols from 
  biomass burning as well as industrial aerosols (i.e. -1.1 to -1.9 from Lohmann 
  et al., 2000) and the assessment of carbon aerosol forcing from this model (-0.9 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup>) is less than that for carbon aerosols from the first indirect 
  effect from the Chuang et al. (2000a) model in <a href="199.htm#tab511a">Table 
  5.11a</a> (i.e. -1.51 Wm<sup>-2</sup>). In view of this, the range of forcing 
  estimates for the combination of first and second indirect effects is -1.1 to 
  -3.7 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. Clearly, the uncertainty is relatively large, and considerable 
  effort will be required to improve indirect forcing estimates. <br>
</p>
<p>A few of the factors that may contribute to this uncertainty are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The pre-industrial sulphate used in these studies varies by a factor of 
    just over two, and the anthropogenic indirect forcing is calculated from the 
    difference between the pre-industrial and industrial scenarios. Considering 
    the non-linearities in the parametrizations of N<sub>d</sub>. the pre-industrial 
    sulphate concentration can be a significant factor.</li>
  <li> The variance in the industrial sulphate concentrations is about 50%.</li>
  <li>The parametrizations or methods of relating droplet number concentrations 
    to aerosol concentrations have been discussed in <a href="184.htm">Section 
    5.3.4</a>. Using <a href="184.htm#fig57">Figure 5.7</a>, we can estimate the 
    range of uncertainty attached to simply the differences in the parametrizations 
    shown in the figure. For stratiform cloud, assuming a mean sulphate concentration 
    of 0.5 mg m<sup>-3</sup> over the oceans and 2.0 mg m<sup>-3</sup> over the 
    land, the differences among the parametrizations in <a href="184.htm#fig57">Figure 
    5.7</a> amount to about 30%. Neglecting that there is a serious question about 
    the ability of the empirical methods to represent the global aerosol, this 
    is a reasonable approximation based on current knowledge. As a couple of footnotes, 
    Rotstayn (1999) compared the forcings using the Boucher and Lohmann (1995) 
    parametrization with a similar parametrization from Roelofs et al. (1998), 
    and found the result with the Roelofs et al. method was 25% higher. And the 
    relatively close agreement of the Boucher and Lohmann (1995) method with the 
    prognostic method (<a href="184.htm#fig57">Figure 5.7</a>) has also been seen 
    in the simulated results from MIRAGE model (Ghan et al., 2001a).</li>
  <li>Changes in the vertical distribution of the aerosol will affect the indirect 
    forcing because of changes in its spatial relationship to cloud. Rotstayn 
    (1999) found a 24% change in the radiative forcing depending on whether the 
    aerosol concentration decreased exponentially or was uniform with height through 
    the lower 10 km. Jones and Slingo (1996) distributed the aerosol mass uniformly, 
    half in the lower 2 km, and half above, compared with Jones et al. (1994b) 
    who confined half the aerosol mass to the lower 1.5 km. Jones and Slingo (1996) 
    obtained an indirect forcing 15% higher than Jones et al. (1994b).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to draw attention to some other factors concerning the comparison 
  of the forcing estimates from the various models.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Boucher and Lohmann (1995) found very little difference between the LMD 
    (French) and ECHAM (German) models. Jones and Slingo (1996) found that the 
    Hadley (UK Met Office) model produced a lower forcing in the Northern Hemisphere 
    relative to the Boucher and Lohmann results, however, this may have been due 
    to differences in the distribution of sulphate mass as well as the GCM. </li>
  <li>The effect of horizontal resolution of the GCM was considered by Ghan et 
    al. (2001b). They found an increase in the indirect forcing of about 40% when 
    the horizontal resolution was degraded from 2.8&deg;x2.8&deg; to 4.5&deg;x7.5&deg;.</li>
  <li>There have been no studies that have explicitly considered the effect of 
    the cloud cover parametrization on the first indirect effect alone. Lohmann 
    and Feichter (1997) examined the effect of two different cloud cover parametrizations 
    (Sundquist et al., 1989 and Xu and Randall, 1996) on the combined first and 
    second indirect effects, which gave a difference of more than a factor of 
    3 in the indirect forcing. Indeed, the effect of uncertainties in the GCM 
    predictions of cloud cover (which are known to be inaccurate) is not known. 
  </li>
  <li>The autoconversion parametrization is a critical step in the simulation 
    of the second indirect effect. Lohmann and Feichter (1997) compared two such 
    parametrizations and found a difference in the total indirect forcing of a 
    factor of two. Ghan et al. (2001b) compared two other methods for autoconversion 
    and found a difference of about 30%. Rotstayn (1999) performed a sensitivity 
    experiment in which the droplet size threshold for autoconversion was increased. 
    This resulted in a reduction of the second indirect effect, but there was 
    a slightly compensating increase in the first indirect effect. This is an 
    area of high sensitivity and uncertainty.</li>
