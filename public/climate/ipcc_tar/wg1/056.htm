<p><a href="#fig26">Figure 2.6</a> summarises the relative 
  changes of UKMO SST, UKMO NMAT and CRU land-surface air temperature. The greater 
  warming of the land in recent years is clear, but otherwise all three curves 
  have a generally similar shape except that modest cooling of NMAT in the late 
  19th century is not seen in the SST data as noted for <a href="055.htm#fig25">Figure 
  2.5</a>. The relative coldness of the land around 1885 to 1895 comes from the 
  Northern Hemisphere continental interiors, particularly in winter, as global 
  coastal land air temperature and adjacent SST anomalies agree well at this time 
  (Parker et al., 1995), confirmed by the Jones et al. (2001) data. Note that 
  there are some systematic compensating differences between the land and SST 
  in the late 19th century in both hemispheres (not shown). The CRU land data 
  are generally about 0.1 to 0.2&deg;C colder in the Northern Hemisphere except 
  at the beginning of the record (early 1860s), when they agree, and rather colder 
  than this in 1885 to 1890. The opposite is seen in the Southern Hemisphere before 
  1885 when SST is generally 0.1 to 0.2&deg;C colder and 0.3&deg;C colder around 
  1875. Overall the SST data are less variable in each hemisphere in these rather 
  poorly observed periods. The Southern Hemisphere land temperature at this time 
  can actually represent a very small observed area of the hemisphere while the 
  SST data, though sparse, are generally considerably more widespread. The sharp 
  cooling in SST around 1903/4 in <a href="055.htm#fig25">Figures 2.5</a> and 
  <a href="#fig26">2.6</a>, seen in the land as well as the two ocean surface 
  data sets, was discussed for the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans by Helland-Hansen 
  and Nansen (1920) not long after the event. The reduced warming of the NMAT 
  in the last decade reflects differences in the Southern Hemisphere discussed 
  above. Slightly greater warming of the global ocean than the global land in 
  1910 to 1945 (seen in <a href="053.htm#tab21">Table 2.1</a>) is within the uncertainties 
  of either data set, as a slightly slower warming of the ocean might be expected 
  on physical grounds. <br>
  <br>
  <a href="056.htm#fig27">Figures 2.7a</a> to c show annual time-series of anomalies 
  of combined land-surface air temperature and SST for the hemispheres and globe 
  since 1861, based on the latest CRU land air temperature data and the UKMO SST 
  data. Jones et al. (2001) temperature data have been averaged by both a standard 
  weighting method, used in the SAR, as shown by the dashed smoothed curves, and 
  by an optimum averaging method (Shen et al., 1998; Folland et al., 2001) as 
  shown by the bars and solid smoothed curves. The latter method uses the variance-covariance 
  matrix instead of correlation functions (Kagan, 1997). The calculated 
  uncertainties (twice the standard error) in the annual values are also shown 
  (including the independent urbanisation and SST bias correction uncertainties). 
  Optimum averaging gives less weight to areas of high data uncertainty than do 
  ordinary averaging methods, and it takes much better account of data gaps. It 
  also gives more weight to Antarctica, the great bulk of which (away from the 
  Antarctic Peninsula) has warmed little in the last two decades (Comiso, 2000). 
  Optimum averages can affect individual years markedly when data are sparse. 
  Thus extra warmth of the warm year 1878 (strongly affected by the 1877/78 El 
  Ni&ntilde;o) in the Northern relative to the Southern Hemisphere in the area 
  weighted average (not shown) disappears when optimum averages are used. In the 
  Northern Hemisphere, the optimum averages are little different from area weighted 
  averages, but they are consistently warmer in the sparsely sampled Southern 
  Hemisphere before 1940, often by more than one tenth of a degree. The overall 
  effect on global temperature is small, however (<a href="#fig27">Figure 
  2.7c</a>)<br>
  <br>
  The five warmest global optimally averaged years since the beginning of the 
  record in 1861 all occurred in the 1990s with 1998 having the warmest anomaly 
  (0.55&deg;C). This year was significantly warmer than the second warmest year, 
  1995 (0.38&deg;C), while 1999 was fourth warmest year, despite the strong La 
  Ni&ntilde;a event. The remarkably consistent monthly global warmth of 1998 is 
  discussed in Karl et al. (2000).<br>
  <br>
  <a href="053.htm#tab22">Table 2.2</a> shows linear trends of the annual optimum 
  averages, and twice their standard errors, for the globe and hemispheres using 
  the restricted maximum likelihood method as in <a href="053.htm#tab21">Table 
  2.1</a> and allowing for the annual uncertainties due to data gaps, urbanisation 
  over land, and bias corrections to SST. Since 1861 the hemispheres have warmed 
  by approximately the same amount. However both the earlier period of warming 
  (1910 to 1945) and the more recent one (1976 to 1999) saw rates of warming about 
  twice as great in the Northern Hemisphere. There was continued (non-significant) 
  warming in the Southern Hemisphere, though at a reduced rate, in 1946 to 1975, 
  which partially offset (non-significant) cooling in the Northern Hemisphere 
  over the same period to give a (non-significant) 0.03&deg;C cooling globally. 
  The global trend from 1861 to 2000 can be cautiously interpreted as an equivalent 
  linear warming of 0.61&deg;C over the 140-year period, with a 95% confidence 
  level uncertainty of &plusmn; 0.16&deg;C. From 1901 an equivalent warming of 
  0.57&deg;C has occurred, with an uncertainty of &plusmn; 0.17&deg;C. </p>
<p><a href="#fig28">Figure 2.8</a> shows a smoothed optimally averaged 
  annual global time-series with estimates of uncertainty at &plusmn; twice the 
  standard error of the smoothed (near decadal) estimate. Note that the optimum 
  average uncertainties increase in earlier years mainly because of the much larger 
  data gaps. Also shown are uncertainties estimated by Jones et al. (1997b) using 
  a different method centred on the Jones et al. (2001) land and sea surface temperature 
  series. This series uses the average of anomalies from all available grid boxes, 
  weighted according to grid box area. Therefore, in contrast to the Jones et 
  al. (2001) global land-surface air temperature data, the global land and sea 
  surface temperature data are not a simple average of the hemispheres. The optimally 
  averaged uncertainties vary from about 15 to 65% less than those given by Jones 
  et al. (1997b). This is reasonable as optimum averages have minimum variance 
  amongst the range of unbiased estimates of the average. Not surprisingly, there 
  is relatively little difference in the decadal averages themselves. However 
  unlike the Jones et al. estimates of uncertainty, the optimum average also includes 
  uncertainties in bias corrections to SST up to 1941 (Folland and Parker, 1995) 
  and the uncertainties (as included in <a href="052.htm#fig21">Figure 2.1</a>) 
  in the land data component that are due to urbanisation. Cessation of the SST 
  component of uncertainty after 1941 is the reason for a lack of increase in 
  uncertainties in the fairly poorly observed period 1942 to 1945. Uncertainties 
  due to changes in thermometer screens are poorly known but could be 0.1&deg;C 
  globally in the 19th and early 20th centuries (Parker, 1994); they are not included 
  here, but a preliminary analysis appears in Folland et al. (2001). For further 
  discussion of changes in land and ocean surface temperature, see Jones et al. 
  (1999a).<br>
  <br>
  Referring back to <a href="053.htm#tab22">Table 2.2</a> and including the second 
  decimal place, our best estimate of the equivalent linear rate of global land 
  and ocean surface warming between 1861 to 2000 is 0.044&deg;C/decade, or a warming 
  of 0.61 &plusmn; 0.16&deg;C. Over the period 1901 to 2000, the equivalent values 
  are 0.058&deg;C/decade or a warming of 0.57 &plusmn; 0.17&deg;C. These values 
  include the modifying effects of the annual uncertainties. So we calculate that 
  since the late 19th or the beginning of the 20th century, up to 2000, global 
  warming has been 0.6 &plusmn; 0.2&deg;C. This is 0.15&deg;C more warming than 
  the 0.3 to 0.6&deg;C estimated more subjectively up to 1994 by the SAR. This 
  relatively large increase is explained by the increase in temperature since 
  the SAR was completed, improved methods of analysis and the fact that the SAR 
  decided not update the value in the First Assessment Report, despite slight 
  additional warming. The latter decision was likely to have been due to a cautious 
  interpretation of overall uncertainties which had at that time to be subjectively 
  assessed.<br>
