<h3>5.4.5 Assessment of the Uncertainty in Indirect Forcing of the First Kind</h3>
<p>Estimation of the uncertainty in the complete (i.e. the first and second indirect 
  effects) radiative forcing is not currently feasible due to a lack of analytical 
  relationships to treat the indirect forcing of the second kind. However, the 
  indirect forcing of the first kind can be treated if we adopt a simple box-model 
  approach such as those used in early assessments of indirect forcing (e.g., 
  Charlson et al., 1992; Schwartz and Slingo, 1996).This evaluation of uncertainty 
  is only illustrative both because of the box-model nature of the estimate and 
  because our assessment of the uncertainty in the parameters is only first order. 
  Nevertheless, it is useful to make such calculations since they can yield valuable 
  information both on our current state of knowledge with regard to the indirect 
  forcing and can help guide efforts to reduce uncertainty. Moreover they illustrate 
  a rigorous method that could allow a more quantitative estimate of uncertainty 
  than the methods followed in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>.<br>
</p>
<p> We adopt a functional relationship between sulphate concentrations and cloud 
  droplet number concentration based on empirical relationships in order to render 
  the calculations more tractable. Therefore, this analysis is only applicable 
  to the Northern Hemisphere, since data from this region were used to derive 
  the empirical relationship. The analysis is further restricted to the marine 
  atmosphere and excludes any consideration of indirect forcing by biomass aerosols.<br>
</p>
<p> The indirect forcing of the first kind ( hereafter called simply the indirect 
  forcing) can be expressed as:</p>
<p align="center"><a name="eq1"></a><img src="images/equ5-3.gif" width="324" height="40"></p>
<p>where F<sub>d</sub> is the average downward flux at the top of the atmosphere, 
  T<sub>a</sub> is the atmospheric transmission above the cloud layer, f<sub>c</sub> 
  is the fractional cloud cover of those clouds susceptible to aerosol modulation 
  and <FONT FACE="Symbol">D</font>A<sub>p</sub> is the change in planetary albedo 
  (equivalent here to the above cloud albedo) associated with an increase in the 
  cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC). To take into account multiple reflections 
  between the cloud layer and the surface, the expression of Liou (1980) is used 
  with an assumption of no absorption within the cloud. This assumption is very 
  reasonable for the bulk of the incoming radiation which will be scattered by 
  cloud drops, i.e., subject to the indirect effect, but does restrict the radiation 
  band to a range from 0.3 to 0.7 mm. Thus:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><a name="eq2"></a><img src="images/equ5-4.gif" width="400" height="38"><br>
</p>
<p>where A<sub>c</sub> is the cloud albedo and R<sub>s</sub> is the albedo of 
  the underlying surface. <font face="Symbol">D</font>A<sub>p</sub> is then calculated 
  as the difference between this function evaluated for A<sub>c</sub>, the background 
  cloud albedo, and A<sub>c</sub>', the anthropogenically perturbed albedo (note 
  that "primed" quantities will always refer to anthropogenically perturbed 
  values of the quantity). Cloud albedo is, in turn, evaluated using the relationship: 
</p>
<div align="center"><a name="eq3"></a><img src="images/equ5-5.gif" width="315" height="32"> 
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>which is an approximation of the two stream evaluation of cloud albedo for 
  conservative scattering assuming an asymmetry parameter of 0.85 (Lacis and Hansen, 
  1974). Here, <font face="Symbol">t</font><sub>c</sub> is the cloud optical depth, 
  given by the expression of Twomey (1977):<br>
</p>
<div align="center"><a name="eq4"></a><img src="images/equ5-6.gif" width="366" height="37"> 
</div>
<div align="center"></div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>where h is the cloud layer thickness, LWC is the layer mean liquid-water content, 
  N<sub>d</sub> is the CDNC, and <font face="Symbol">r</font> is the density of 
  water. To relate the CDNC to anthropogenic emissions, we use the empirical expression 
  of Boucher and Lohmann (1995) which has the form:<br>
</p>
<div align="center"><a name="eq5"></a><img src="images/equ5-7.gif" width="301" height="35"> 
</div>
<div align="center"></div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>where SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is the mean concentration of sulphate aerosol 
  at cloud base in &micro;g m<sup>-3</sup>, and A and B are empirical constants. 
  We adopt the values of A=115 and B=0.48 which are appropriate for marine air 
  (Boucher and Lohmann, 1995).<br>
  <br>
  Using the same procedures as with the assessment of uncertainties in the direct 
  forcing (e.g. <a href="197.htm#542">Section 5.4.2</a>), we first determine the 
  uncertainties in the most fundamental parameters. We then use Taylor expansions 
  of the various equations given above to determine the uncertainty in the forcing 
  associated with the central values of the parameters used in the calculations. 
  Thus the uncertainty involves the uncertainties in the concentration of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> 
  and in the empirical coefficients used to relate the concentration of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> 
  to N<sup>d</sup>. Moreover, the calculation of uncertainty necessarily involves 
  an evaluation of A<sub>c</sub> for both the background and anthropogenically 
  perturbed values. These quantities, together with corresponding values for LWC 
  and h, which are based on available observations, are then used to generate 
  uncertainties in the cloud optical depth. This hierarchical evaluation proceeds 
  "upward" from the uncertainty in the primary variables until the uncertainty 
  in the forcing itself, together with the associated central value can be assessed. 
  Such an uncertainty estimate is different in philosophy from that used in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a> which only assesses the range of estimates in the literature. </p>
