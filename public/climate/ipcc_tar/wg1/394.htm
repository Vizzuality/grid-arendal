<h3>10.5.3 Summary and Recommendations </h3>
<p>Since the SAR, significant improvements have been achieved in the areas of 
  development and understanding of the nested regional climate modelling technique. 
  These include many new RCM systems, multiple nesting, coupling with different 
  components of the climate system and research into the effects of domain size, 
  resolution, boundary forcing and internal model variability. As a result, a 
  number of RCM systems are currently available with the capability of high-resolution, 
  multi-decadal simulations in a variety of regional settings. Nested RCMs have 
  shown marked improvements in their ability to reproduce present day average 
  climate, with some of this improvement due to better quality driving fields 
  provided by GCMs. Seasonal temperature and precipitation biases in state-of-the-art 
  RCMs are generally less than 1 to 2&deg;C and a few percent to 50 to 60 % of 
  observed precipitation, respectively, over regions of size 10<sup>5</sup> to 
  10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup>. However, it is imperative for the effective use 
  of RCMs in climate change work that the quality of GCM large-scale driving fields 
  continues to improve. Research aiming at reducing systematic errors in both 
  GCMs and RCMs should be carried out. With significantly improved model systems 
  the evidence, so far, indicates that improved regional climate change simulations 
  can be produced in the near future.</p>
<p>The analysis of RCM simulations has extended beyond simple averages to include 
  higher-order climate statistics, and has indicated that RCMs can effectively 
  reproduce interannual variability when driven by good quality forcing fields. 
  However, more anlysis and improvements are needed of the model performance in 
  simulating climate variability at short time-scales (daily to sub-daily).</p>
<p>A serious problem concerning RCM evaluation is a general lack of good quality 
  high-resolution observed data. In many areas, observations are extremely sparse 
  due to complex geography or remoteness of settings. In addition, only a little 
  work has been carried out on how to use point measurements to evaluate the grid-box 
  mean values from a climate model, especially when using sparse station networks. 
  This limits the ability to assess model skill in complex terrain and remote 
  regions. It is essential for the advancement of regional climate understanding 
  and modelling, that more research aiming at improving the quality of data for 
  model evaluation is performed.</p>
<p>Overall, the evidence is strong that regional models consistently improve the 
  spatial detail of simulated climate compared to GCMs because of their better 
  representation of sub-GCM grid scale forcings, especially in regard to the surface 
  hydrologic budget. This is not necessarily the case for region-averaged climate. 
  The increased resolution of RCMs also allows the simulation of a broader spectrum 
  of weather events, in particular concerning higher order climate statistics 
  such as daily precipitation intensity distributions. Analysis of some RCM experiments 
  indicate that this is in the direction of increased agreement with observations.</p>
<p>Several RCM studies have been important for understanding climate change processes, 
  such as the elevation signature of the climate change signal or the effect of 
  climate change at the river catchment level. However, a consistent set of RCM 
  simulations of climate change for different regions which can be used as climate 
  change scenarios for impact work is still not available. Most RCM climate change 
  simulations have been sensitivity and process studies aimed at specific goals. 
  The need is there to co-ordinate RCM simulation efforts and to extend studies 
  to more regions so that ensemble simulations with different models and scenarios 
  can be developed to provide useful information for impact assessments. This 
  will need to be achieved under the auspices of international or large national 
  programmes. Within this context, an important issue is to provide RCM simulations 
  of increasing length to minimise limitations due to sampling problems.</p>
