<h3>5.3.6 Ice Formation and Indirect Forcing<br>
</h3>
<p>Formation of ice in the atmosphere has long been recognised to be a topic of 
  great importance due to its key role in the precipitation process. However, 
  progress in elucidating this role has been plagued by a host of complex issues 
  such as the precise mode of action of ice nuclei (IN) (e.g., Cooper, 1980), 
  in situ modification of IN activity by various substrate coatings, including 
  residual ice (Borys, 1989; Curry et al., 1990; Rosinski and Morgan, 1991; Beard, 
  1992; Vali, 1992), secondary ice production (e.g., Beard, 1992) and a lack of 
  consistency in measurement techniques (cf., Bigg, 1990; Vali, 1991; Rogers, 
  1993; Pruppacher and Klett, 1997).</p>
<p> Because of these issues, it is premature to quantitatively assess the impact 
  of ice formation on indirect forcing. Instead, the potential importance of such 
  formation is given a preliminary assessment by addressing a set of four fundamental 
  and serial questions whose answers would, in principle, yield the desired assessment. 
  A summary of what is known with respect to these questions is given below.</p>
<p><i>Does ice formation have an impact on radiative forcing?</i><br>
  In principle the phase partitioning of water in clouds should have a substantial 
  impact on cloud radiative forcing, first because the ice hydrometeors will tend 
  to be much larger than cloud drops and thus increase precipitation, and second 
  because the size of hydrometeors (determined by both ice/vapour and ice/liquid 
  partitioning) can have a significant impact on radiative balances. Several GCM 
  sensitivity studies have supported these expectations (e.g., Senior and Mitchell, 
  1993; Fowler and Randall, 1996) by demonstrating that the fraction of supercooled 
  water in the models which is converted to ice has a significant impact on the 
  global radiative balance. A simple sensitivity study with the ECHAM model (cf., 
  Lohmann and Feichter, 1997) conducted for this assessment revealed a very large 
  difference in globally averaged cloud forcing of +16.9 Wm<sup>-2</sup> induced 
  by allowing only ice in clouds with temperatures below 0&deg;C as compared with 
  allowing only water in clouds with temperatures above -35&deg;C. The liquid-water 
  path change in these experiments (160 gm<sup>-2</sup> to 54.9 gm<sup>-2</sup>) 
  was larger than the 60% uncertainty in this quantity from measurements (Greenwald 
  et al., 1993; Weng and Grody, 1994). However, this certainly demonstrates that 
  even small changes in ice formation could have a significant impact on the indirect 
  climate forcing due to aerosols. </p>
<p><i>Is formation of the ice phase modulated by aerosols?</i><br>
  The relative roles of different types of ice nucleation in cirrus clouds is 
  very complex (e.g., Sassen and Dodd, 1988; Heymsfield and Miloshevich, 1993, 
  1995; DeMott et al., 1997, 1998; Strom et al., 1997; Xu et al., 1998; Martin, 
  1998; Koop et al., 1999). Presumably there is a temperature-dependent transition 
  from predominantly heterogeneous nucleation (i.e., initiated at a phase boundary 
  with a substrate - the heterogeneous nucleus) to homogeneous nucleation 
  (i.e., within the liquid phase alone - no substrate required) that depends 
  on the chemistry and size of the precursor haze drops of the homogeneous process 
  as well as on the chemistry and concentration of the heterogeneous nuclei. Supersaturations 
  with respect to ice in excess of 40 to 50% are necessary to freeze sulphate 
  haze drops, even at quite low temperatures. Far lower supersaturations will 
  be adequate if hetero-geneous IN are present. There is thus a large supersaturation 
  range in which heterogeneous IN could have a significant impact (Fahey et al., 
  1999). However, in both heterogeneous and homogeneous cases, aerosols play an 
  important role in glaciation.</p>
<p>For lower level, warmer (though still supercooled) clouds, in principle the 
  answer to our query is necessarily positive. In this vast, liquid-water reservoir, 
  temperatures are simply too warm for homogeneous freezing of cloud drops to 
  occur and aerosol surfaces of some sort must provide the substrate for ice initiation. 
  However, prolific secondary ice formation due to such processes as the Hallett-Mossop 
  mechanism renders the establishment of a clear relationship between measured 
  IN concentrations and ice particle concentrations quite difficult (cf., Beard, 
  1992; Rangno and Hobbs, 1994). Nevertheless, in some instances relationships 
  between IN concentrations and ice formation in lower-tropospheric clouds have 
  been found (e.g., Stith et al., 1994; DeMott et al., 1996). This lends credibility 
  to the view that the actual ice initiation process must be modulated by aerosols.</p>
<p>For both upper and lower level clouds in the troposphere, it seems clear that 
  the ice initiation process is dependent on aerosols, though the nucleation process 
  can proceed via different pathways and from a variety of different nucleating 
  chemical species.</p>
