<h2>Executive Summary </h2>
<p>The IPCC WG1 Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) concluded, 
  "the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence 
  on global climate". It noted that the detection and attribution of anthropogenic 
  climate change signals can only be accomplished through a gradual accumulation 
  of evidence. The SAR authors also noted uncertainties in a number of factors, 
  including the magnitude and patterns of internal climate variability, external 
  forcing and climate system response, which prevented them from drawing a stronger 
  conclusion. The results of the research carried out since 1995 on these uncertainties 
  and other aspects of detection and attribution are summarised below. </p>
<p><i>A longer and more closely scrutinised observational record</i><br>
  Three of the five years (1995, 1996 and 1998) added to the instrumental record 
  since the SAR are the warmest in the instrumental record of global temperatures, 
  consistent with the expectation that increases in greenhouse gases will lead 
  to continued long-term warming. The impact of observational sampling errors 
  has been estimated for the global and hemispheric mean surface temperature record 
  and found to be small relative to the warming observed over the 20th century. 
  Some sources of error and uncertainty in both the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) 
  and radiosonde observations have been identified that largely resolve discrepancies 
  between the two data sets. However, current climate models cannot fully account 
  for the observed difference in the trend between the surface and lower-tropospheric 
  temperatures over the last twenty years even when all known external influences 
  are included. New reconstructions of the surface temperature record of the last 
  1,000 years indicate that the temperature changes over the last 100 years are 
  unlikely to be entirely natural in origin, even taking into account the large 
  uncertainties in palaeo-reconstructions. </p>
<p><i>New model estimates of internal variability</i><br>
  Since the SAR, more models have been used to estimate the magnitude of internal 
  climate variability. Several of the models used for detection show similar or 
  larger variability than observed on interannual to decadal time-scales, even 
  in the absence of external forcing. The warming over the past 100 years is very 
  unlikely to be due to internal variability alone as estimated by current models. 
  Estimates of variability on the longer time-scales relevant to detection and 
  attribution studies are uncertain. Nonetheless, conclusions on the detection 
  of an anthropogenic signal are insensitive to the model used to estimate internal 
  variability and recent changes cannot be accounted for as pure internal variability 
  even if the amplitude of simulated internal variations is increased by a factor 
  of two or more. In most recent studies, the residual variability that remains 
  in the observations after removal of the estimated anthropogenic signals is 
  consistent with model-simulated variability on the space- and time-scales used 
  for detection and attribution. Note, however, that the power of the consistency 
  test is limited. Detection studies to date have shown that the observed large-scale 
  changes in surface temperature in recent decades are unlikely (bordering on 
  very unlikely) to be entirely the result of internal variability. </p>
<p><i>New estimates of responses to natural forcing</i><br>
  Fully coupled ocean-atmosphere models have used reconstructions of solar and 
  volcanic forcings over the last one to three centuries to estimate the contribution 
  of natural forcing to climate variability and change. Including their effects 
  produces an increase in variance on all time-scales and brings the low-frequency 
  variability simulated by models closer to that deduced from palaeo-reconstructions. 
  Assessments based on physical principles and model simulations indicate that 
  natural forcing alone is unlikely to explain the increased rate of global warming 
  since the middle of the 20th century or changes in vertical temperature structure. 
  The reasons are that the trend in natural forcing has likely been negative over 
  the last two decades and natural forcing alone is unlikely to account for the 
  observed cooling of the stratosphere. However, there is evidence for a detectable 
  volcanic influence on climate. The available evidence also suggests a solar 
  influence in proxy records of the last few hundred years and also in the instrumental 
  record of the early 20th century. Statistical assessments confirm that natural 
  variability (the combination of internal and naturally forced) is unlikely to 
  explain the warming in the latter half of the 20th century. </p>
