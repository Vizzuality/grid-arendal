<h2>Executive Summary </h2>
<p><i>CO<sub>2</sub> concentration trends and budgets</i></p>
<p>Before the Industrial Era, circa 1750, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) 
  concentration was 280 &plusmn; 10 ppm for several thousand years. It has risen 
  continuously since then, reaching 367 ppm in 1999. <br>
  <br>
  The present atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has not been exceeded during 
  the past 420,000 years, and likely not during the past 20 million years. The 
  rate of increase over the past century is unprecedented, at least during the 
  past 20,000 years. <br>
  <br>
  The present atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increase is caused by anthropogenic emissions 
  of CO<sub>2</sub>. About three-quarters of these emissions are due to fossil 
  fuel burning. Fossil fuel burning (plus a small contribution from cement production) 
  released on average 5.4 &plusmn; 0.3 PgC/yr during 1980 to 1989, and 6.3 &plusmn; 
  0.4 PgC/yr during 1990 to 1999. Land use change is responsible for the rest 
  of the emissions.<br>
  <br>
  The rate of increase of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> content was 3.3 &plusmn; 
  0.1 PgC/yr during 1980 to 1989 and 3.2 &plusmn; 0.1 PgC/yr during 1990 to 1999. 
  These rates are less than the emissions, because some of the emitted CO<sub>2</sub> 
  dissolves in the oceans, and some is taken up by terrestrial ecosystems. Individual 
  years show different rates of increase. For example, 1992 was low (1.9 PgC/yr), 
  and 1998 was the highest (6.0 PgC/yr) since direct measurements began in 1957. 
  This variability is mainly caused by variations in land and ocean uptake.<br>
  <br>
  Statistically, high rates of increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> have occurred 
  in most El Ni&ntilde;o years, although low rates occurred during the extended 
  El Ni&ntilde;o of 1991 to 1994. Surface water CO<sub>2</sub> measurements from 
  the equatorial Pacific show that the natural source of CO<sub>2</sub> from this 
  region is reduced by between 0.2 and 1.0 PgC/yr during El Ni&ntilde;o events, 
  counter to the atmospheric increase. It is likely that the high rates of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  increase during most El Ni&ntilde;o events are explained by reductions in land 
  uptake, caused in part by the effects of high temperatures, drought and fire 
  on terrestrial ecosystems in the tropics. <br>
  <br>
  Land and ocean uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> can now be separated using atmospheric 
  measurements (CO<sub>2</sub>, oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and 13CO<sub>2</sub>). 
  For 1980 to 1989, the ocean-atmosphere flux is estimated as -1.9 &plusmn; 0.6 
  PgC/yr and the land-atmosphere flux as -0.2 &plusmn; 0.7 PgC/yr based on CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and O<sub>2</sub> measurements (negative signs denote net uptake). For 1990 
  to 1999, the ocean-atmosphere flux is estimated as -1.7 &plusmn; 0.5 PgC/yr 
  and the land-atmosphere flux as -1.4 &plusmn; 0.7 PgC/yr. These figures are 
  consistent with alternative budgets based on CO<sub>2</sub> and 13CO<sub>2</sub> 
  measurements, and with independent estimates based on measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and 13CO<sub>2</sub> in sea water. The new 1980s estimates are also consistent 
  with the ocean-model based carbon budget of the IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report 
  (IPCC, 1996a) (hereafter SAR). The new 1990s estimates update the budget derived 
  using SAR methodologies for the IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land Use Change 
  and Forestry (IPCC, 2000a).<br>
  <br>
  The net CO<sub>2</sub> release due to land-use change during the 1980s has been 
  estimated as 0.6 to 2.5 PgC/yr (central estimate 1.7 PgC/yr). This net CO<sub>2</sub> 
  release is mainly due to deforestation in the tropics. Uncertainties about land-use 
  changes limit the accuracy of these estimates. Comparable data for the 1990s 
  are not yet available. <br>
  <br>
  The land-atmosphere flux estimated from atmospheric observations comprises the 
  balance of net CO<sub>2</sub> release due to land-use changes and CO<sub>2</sub> 
  uptake by terrestrial systems (the "residual terrestrial sink"). The residual 
  terrestrial sink is estimated as -1.9 PgC/yr (range -3.8 to +0.3 PgC/yr) during 
  the 1980s. It has several likely causes, including changes in land management 
  practices and fertilisation effects of increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and nitrogen (N) deposition, leading to increased vegetation and soil carbon.<br>
  <br>
  Modelling based on atmospheric observations (inverse modelling) enables the 
  land-atmosphere and ocean-atmosphere fluxes to be partitioned between broad 
  latitudinal bands. The sites of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake in the ocean 
  are not resolved by inverse modelling because of the large, natural background 
  air-sea fluxes (outgassing in the tropics and uptake in high latitudes). Estimates 
  of the land-atmosphere flux north of 30&deg;N during 1980 to 1989 range from 
  -2.3 to -0.6 PgC/yr; for the tropics, -1.0 to +1.5 PgC/yr. These results imply 
  substantial terrestrial sinks for anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> in the northern 
  extra-tropics, and in the tropics (to balance deforestation). The pattern for 
  the 1980s persisted into the 1990s. <br>
  <br>
  Terrestrial carbon inventory data indicate carbon sinks in northern and tropical 
  forests, consistent with the results of inverse modelling.<br>
  <br>
  East-west gradients of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration are an order 
  of magnitude smaller than north-south gradients. Estimates of continental-scale 
  CO<sub>2</sub> balance are possible in principle but are poorly constrained 
  because there are too few well-calibrated CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring sites, especially 
  in the interior of continents, and insufficient data on air-sea fluxes and vertical 
  transport in the atmosphere.</p>
<p><i>The global carbon cycle and anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub></i></p>
<p>The global carbon cycle operates through a variety of response and feedback 
  mechanisms. The most relevant for decade to century time-scales are listed here.</p>
<p>Responses of the carbon cycle to changing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> by the ocean is primarily governed 
    by ocean circulation and carbonate chemistry. So long as atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
    concentration is increasing there is net uptake of carbon by the ocean, driven 
    by the atmosphere-ocean difference in partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>. 
    The fraction of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> that is taken up by the ocean 
    declines with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, due to reduced buffer 
    capacity of the carbonate system. The fraction taken up by the ocean also 
    declines with the rate of increase of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, because 
    the rate of mixing between deep water and surface water limits CO<sub>2</sub> 
    uptake. </li>
  <li>Increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has no significant fertilisation effect 
    on marine biological productivity, but it decreases pH. Over a century, changes 
    in marine biology brought about by changes in calcification at low pH could 
    increase the ocean uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> by a few percentage points.</li>
  <li>Terrestrial uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> is governed by net biome production 
    (NBP), which is the balance of net primary production (NPP) and carbon losses 
    due to heterotrophic respiration (decomposition and herbivory) and fire, including 
    the fate of harvested biomass. NPP increases when atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
    concentration is increased above present levels (the "fertilisation" effect 
    occurs directly through enhanced photo-synthesis, and indirectly through effects 
    such as increased water use efficiency). At high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
    (800 to 1,000 ppm) any further direct CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation effect 
    is likely to be small. The effectiveness of terrestrial uptake as a carbon 
    sink depends on the transfer of carbon to forms with long residence times 
    (wood or modified soil organic matter). Management practices can enhance the 
    carbon sink because of the inertia of these "slow" carbon pools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedbacks in the carbon cycle due to climate change</p>
<ul>
  <li>Warming reduces the solubility of CO<sub>2</sub> and therefore reduces uptake 
    of CO<sub>2</sub> by the ocean. </li>
  <li>Increased vertical stratification in the ocean is likely to accompany increasing 
    global temperature. The likely consequences include reduced outgassing of 
    upwelled CO<sub>2</sub>, reduced transport of excess carbon to the deep ocean, 
    and changes in biological productivity.</li>
  <li>On short time-scales, warming increases the rate of heterotrophic respiration 
    on land, but the extent to which this effect can alter land-atmosphere fluxes 
    over longer time-scales is not yet clear. Warming, and regional changes in 
    precipitation patterns and cloudiness, are also likely to bring about changes 
    in terrestrial ecosystem structure, geographic distribution and primary production. 
    The net effect of climate on NBP depends on regional patterns of climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other impacts on the carbon cycle</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changes in management practices are very likely to have significant effects 
    on the terrestrial carbon cycle. In addition to deforestation and afforestation/reforestation, 
    more subtle management effects can be important. For example, fire suppression 
    (e.g., in savannas) reduces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from burning, and encourages 
    woody plant biomass to increase. On agricultural lands, some of the soil carbon 
    lost when land was cleared and tilled can be regained through adoption of 
    low-tillage agriculture.</li>
  <li>Anthropogenic N deposition is increasing terrestrial NPP in some regions; 
    excess tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is likely to be reducing NPP.</li>
  <li>Anthropogenic inputs of nutrients to the oceans by rivers and atmospheric 
    dust may influence marine biological productivity, although such effects are 
    poorly quantified.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Modelling and projection of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration</i></p>
<p>Process-based models of oceanic and terrestrial carbon cycling have been developed, 
  compared and tested against in situ measurements and atmospheric measurements. 
  The following are consistent results based on several models.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Modelled ocean-atmosphere flux during 1980 to 1989 was in the range -1.5 
    to -2.2 PgC/yr for the 1980s, consistent with earlier model estimates and 
    consistent with the atmospheric budget. </li>
  <li>Modelled land-atmosphere flux during 1980 to 1989 was in the range -0.3 
    to -1.5 PgC/yr, consistent with or slightly more negative than the land-atmosphere 
    flux as indicated by the atmospheric budget. CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation 
    and anthropogenic N deposition effects contributed significantly: their combined 
    effect was estimated as -1.5 to -3.1 PgC/yr. Effects of climate change during 
    the 1980s were small, and of uncertain sign. </li>
  <li>In future projections with ocean models, driven by CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
    derived from the IS92a scenario (for illustration and comparison with earlier 
    work), ocean uptake becomes progressively larger towards the end of the century, 
    but represents a smaller fraction of emissions than today. When climate change 
    feedbacks are included, ocean uptake becomes less in all models, when compared 
    with the situation without climate feedbacks. </li>
  <li>In analogous projections with terrestrial models, the rate of uptake by 
    the land due to CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation increases until mid-century, 
    but the models project smaller increases, or no increase, after that time. 
    When climate change feedbacks are included, land uptake becomes less in all 
    models, when compared with the situation without climate feedbacks. Some models 
    have shown a rapid decline in carbon uptake after the mid-century. </li>
</ul>
<p>Two simplified, fast models (ISAM and Bern-CC) were used to project future 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations under IS92a and six SRES scenarios, and to project 
  future emissions under five CO<sub>2</sub> stabilisation scenarios. Both models 
  represent ocean and terrestrial climate feedbacks, in a way consistent with 
  process-based models, and allow for uncertainties in climate sensitivity and 
  in ocean and terrestrial responses to CO<sub>2</sub> and climate.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The reference case projections (which include climate feedbacks) of both 
    models under IS92a are, by coincidence, close to those made in the SAR (which 
    neglected feedbacks). </li>
  <li>The SRES scenarios lead to divergent CO<sub>2</sub> concentration trajectories. 
    Among the six emissions scenarios considered, the projected range of CO<sub>2</sub> 
    concentrations at the end of the century is 550 to 970 ppm (ISAM model) or 
    540 to 960 ppm (Bern-CC model). </li>
  <li>Variations in climate sensitivity and ocean and terrestrial model responses 
    add at least -10 to +30% uncertainty to these values, and to the emissions 
    implied by the stabilisation scenarios. </li>
  <li>The net effect of land and ocean climate feedbacks is always to increase 
    projected atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. This is equivalent to 
    reducing the allowable emissions for stabilisation at any one CO<sub>2</sub> 
    concentration. </li>
  <li>New studies with general circulation models including interactive land and 
    ocean carbon cycle components also indicate that climate feedbacks have the 
    potential to increase atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> but with large uncertainty 
    about the magnitude of the terrestrial biosphere feedback. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Implications</i></p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuel burning are virtually certain to 
  be the dominant factor determining CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations during the 
  21st century. There is scope for land-use changes to increase or decrease CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations on this time-scale. If all of the carbon so far released by land-use 
  changes could<br>
  be restored to the terrestrial biosphere, CO<sub>2</sub> at the end of the century 
  would be 40 to 70 ppm less than it would be if no such intervention had occurred. 
  By comparison, global deforestation would add two to four times more CO<sub>2</sub> 
  to the atmosphere than reforestation of all cleared areas would subtract.</p>
<p>There is sufficient uptake capacity in the ocean to incorporate 70 to 80% of 
  foreseeable anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the atmosphere, this process 
  takes centuries due to the rate of ocean mixing. As a result, even several centuries 
  after emissions occurred, about a quarter of the increase in concentration caused 
  by these emissions is still present in the atmosphere. CO<sub>2</sub> stabilisation 
  at 450, 650 or 1,000 ppm would require global anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
  to drop below 1990 levels, within a few decades, about a century, or about two 
  centuries respectively, and continue to steadily decrease thereafter. Stabilisation 
  requires that net anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions ultimately decline 
  to the level of persistent natural land and ocean<br>
  sinks, which are expected to be small (&lt;0.2 PgC/yr).</p>
