<h4>11.3.2.3 Mean sea level change from satellite altimeter observations</h4>
<p>In contrast to the sparse network of coastal and mid-ocean island tide gauges, 
  measurements of sea level from space by satellite radar altimetry provide near 
  global and homogenous coverage of the world's oceans, thereby allowing 
  the determination of regional sea level change. Satellite altimeters also measure 
  sea level with respect to the centre of the earth. While the results must be 
  corrected for isostatic adjustment (Peltier, 1998), satellite altimetry avoids 
  other vertical land movements (tectonic motions, subsidence) that affect local 
  determinations of sea level trends measured by tide gauges. However, achieving 
  the required sub-millimetre accuracy is demanding and requires satellite orbit 
  information, geophysical and environmental corrections and altimeter range measurements 
  of the highest accuracy. It also requires continuous satellite operations over 
  many years and careful control of biases. </p>
<p>To date, the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite-altimeter mission, with its (near) global 
  coverage from 66&deg;N to 66&deg;S (almost all of the ice-free oceans) from 
  late 1992 to the present, has proved to be of most value to direct estimates 
  of sea level change. The current accuracy of TOPEX/POSEIDON data allows global 
  average sea level to be estimated to a precision of several millimetres every 
  10 days, with the absolute accuracy limited by systematic errors.</p>
<p>Careful comparison of TOPEX/POSEIDON data with tide gauge data reveals a difference 
  in the rate of change of local sea level of -2.3 &plusmn; 1.2 mm/yr (Mitchum, 
  1998) or -2 &plusmn; 1.5 mm/yr (Cazenave et al., 1999). This discrepancy is 
  caused by a combination of instrumental drift, especially in the TOPEX Microwave 
  Radiometer (TMR) (Haines and Bar-Sever, 1998), and vertical land motions which 
  have not been allowed for in the tide gauge data. The most recent estimates 
  of global average sea level rise from the six years of TOPEX/POSEIDON data (using 
  corrections from tide gauge comparisons) are 2.1 &plusmn; 1.2 mm/yr (Nerem et 
  al., 1997), 1.4 &plusmn; 0.2 mm/yr (Cazenave et al., 1998; Figure 11.8), 3.1 
  &plusmn; 1.3 mm/yr (Nerem, 1999) and 2.5 &plusmn; 1.3 mm/yr (Nerem, 1999), of 
  which the last assumes that all instrumental drift can be attributed to the 
  TMR. When Cazenave et al. allow for the TMR drift, they compute a sea level 
  rise of 2.6 mm/yr. Their uncertainty of &plusmn; 0.2 mm/yr does not include 
  allowance for uncertainty in instrumental drift, but only reflects the variations 
  in measured global sea level. Such variations correlate with global average 
  sea surface temperature, perhaps indicating the importance of steric effects 
  through ocean heat storage. Cazenave et al. (1998) and Nerem et al. (1999) argue 
  that ENSO events cause a rise and a subsequent fall in global averaged sea level 
  of about 20 mm (<a href="424.htm#fig118">Figure 11.8</a>). These findings indicate 
  that the major 1997/98 El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event could 
  bias the above estimates of sea level rise and also indicate the difficulty 
  of separating long-term trends from climatic variability.</p>

        in permafrost, the effect of sediment deposition, the long-term adjustment 
        of the ice-sheets to past climate change and the terrestrial storage terms).

<p>After upgrading many of the geophysical corrections on the original European 
  Remote Sensing (ERS) data stream, Cazenave et al. (1998) find little evidence 
  of sea level rise over the period April 1992 to May 1996. However, over the 
  time span of overlap between the ERS-1 and TOPEX/POSEIDON data, similar rates 
  of sea level change (about 0.5 mm/yr) are calculated. For the period April 1992 
  to April 1995, Anzenhofer and Gruber (1998) find a sea level rise of 2.2 &plusmn; 
  1.6 mm/yr. </p>
<p>In summary, analysis of TOPEX/POSEIDON data suggest a rate of sea level rise 
  during the 1990s greater than the mean rate of rise for much of the 20th century. 
  It is not yet clear whether this is the result of a recent acceleration, of 
  systematic differences between the two measurement techniques, or of the shortness 
  of the record (6 years). </p>
