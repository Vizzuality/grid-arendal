<h4>8.5.2.2 Present climate </h4>
<h4><a name="85221"></a>8.5.2.2.1 Wind driven circulation</h4>
<p>The wind-driven dynamics of the interior of the ocean basins are largely a 
  linear response to the wind, and are generally well represented in current models, 
  although there is still some observational debate over the reality of the classical 
  Sverdrup balance (Wunsch and Roemmich, 1985). The main errors can usually be 
  traced back to errors in the driving winds from the atmospheric model. The same 
  can be said of surface Ekman transport, which makes an important contribution 
  to poleward heat transport in the tropics (Danabasoglu, 1998). However, the 
  western boundary currents and inertial recirculations which close the wind-driven 
  gyres are generally poorly resolved by current models, and this may lead to 
  an underestimate of the heat transport by this component of the system at higher 
  latitudes (Fanning and Weaver, 1997a; Bryan and Smith 1998).</p>
<h4><a name="85222"></a>8.5.2.2.2 Heat transport and thermohaline circulation</h4>
<p><a href="315.htm#842">Section 8.4.2</a> and <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>, 
  <a href="298.htm">Section 7.6</a> discuss the fundamental importance of poleward 
  heat transport in modelling the climate system. Ocean heat transport is greatly 
  improved in some more recent models, compared with the models in use at the 
  time of the SAR (see, e.g., <a href="319.htm#tab82">Table 8.2</a>; <a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>, <a href="298.htm">Section 7.6</a>). Increased horizontal resolution (Fanning 
  and Weaver, 1997a; Gordon et al., 2000) and improved parametrization of sub-grid 
  scale mixing (Danabasoglu and McWilliams, 1996; Visbeck et al., 1997; Gordon 
  et al., 2000) have been important factors in this. The fresh water transports 
  of coupled models have not been widely evaluated (see <a href="315.htm#842">Section 
  8.4.2</a> and <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="298.htm">Section 7.6</a>). 
  Bryan (1998) shows how fresh water imbalances can lead to long-term drifts in 
  deep ocean properties.</p>
<p>The thermohaline circulation (THC) plays an important role in poleward heat 
  transport, especially in the North Atlantic. <a href="319.htm#tab82">Table 8.2</a> 
  shows the strength of North Atlantic THC for various models. In contrast to 
  the SAR, some non-flux adjusted models are now able to produce a THC with a 
  realistic strength of around 20 Sv, which is stable for many centuries. A common 
  systematic error at the time of the SAR was a model thermocline that was too 
  deep and diffusive, resulting in deficient heat transport because the temperature 
  contrast between cold, southward and warm, northward flows was too weak. The 
  models with realistic North Atlantic heat transports generally maintain a realistic 
  temperature contrast (<a href="319.htm#tab82">Table 8.2</a>). Some models also 
  show improved realism in the spatial structure of the THC, with separate deep 
  water sources in the Nordic Seas and in the Labrador Sea (Wood et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Interior diapycnal mixing plays a critical role in the thermohaline circulation. 
  Recent process studies (part of WOCE) have confirmed that such mixing is highly 
  localised in the deep ocean (Polzin et al., 1997; Munk and Wunsch, 1998). This 
  mixing is very crudely represented in climate models, and it is not known whether 
  this deficiency has a significant effect on the model thermohaline circulations 
  (Marotzke, 1997).</p>
<p>Although overall heat transports are now better represented in some models, 
  the partition of the heat transport between different components of the circulation 
  may not agree so well with observational estimates (Gordon et al., 2000). How 
  important such discrepancies may be in modelling the transient climate change 
  response is not well understood.</p>
<p>The deep western boundary current, which carries much of the deep branch of 
  the North Atlantic THC, contains a number of strong recirculating gyres (e.g., 
  Hogg, 1983). These recirculations may act as a buffer, delaying the response 
  of the THC to climate anomalies. The representation of these recirculations 
  in climate models, and their importance in transient climate response, have 
  not been evaluated.</p>
<h4><a name="85223"></a>8.5.2.2.3 Antarctic circumpolar current (ACC)</h4>
<p>Many current models produce rather poor estimates of the volume transport of 
  the Antarctic circumpolar current (ACC) (<a href="319.htm#tab82">Table 8.2</a>). 
  The reason for this is not fully understood. Thermohaline as well as wind-driven 
  processes are believed to be important (Cox 1989; Bryan 1998). The problem is 
  shared by some eddy-permitting ocean models, so insufficient horizontal resolution 
  does not seem to be the only factor. The path of the ACC is largely controlled 
  by topography, and errors in the path can lead to significant local sea surface 
  temperature errors. The Atlantic and Indian sectors of the southern ocean appear 
  to be particularly susceptible (e.g., <a href="315.htm#fig81">Figure 8.1b</a>; 
  Gent et al., 1998; Gordon et al., 2000). However, it is not clear how, or whether, 
  the transport and SST errors impact on the atmospheric climate or on the climate 
  change response of the models.</p>
<h4><a name="85224"></a>8.5.2.2.4 Water mass formation</h4>
<p>At high latitudes, deep convection and subsequent spreading of dense water 
  form the deep water masses that fill most of the volume of the ocean. At mid-latitudes, 
  the processes of mode water formation and thermocline ventilation are the means 
  by which surface changes are propagated into the thermocline (<a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>, <a href="282.htm#731">Section 7.3.1</a>). These processes play an important 
  role in determining the effective rate of heat uptake by the ocean in response 
  to climate change (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="356.htm">Section 
  9.3.4.2</a>), and in the response of the THC (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>, <a href="357.htm">Section 9.3.4.3</a>). Water mass formation processes 
  can be evaluated directly from model fields (Guilyardi, 1997; Doney et al., 
  1998), or indirectly using model simulations of the ocean uptake of anthropogenic 
  tracers such as CFCs and carbon 14 (Robitaille and Weaver, 1995; Dixon et al., 
  1996; England and Rahmstorf, 1999; Goosse et al., 1999; England and Maier-Reimer, 
  2001). A conclusion from many of these studies is that, while the models clearly 
  show some skill in this area, ventilation processes are sensitive to the details 
  of the ocean mixing parametrization used. Wiebe and Weaver (1999) show that 
  the efficiency of ocean heat uptake is also sensitive to these parametrizations.
