<p><b><sup><a name="1"></a>1</sup></b> Climate change in IPCC usage refers to 
  any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a 
  result of human activity. This usage differs from that in the Framework Convention 
  on Climate Change, where climate change refers to a change of climate that is 
  attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition 
  of the global atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate variability 
  observed over comparable time periods.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="2"></a>2</sup></b> In total 122 Co-ordinating Lead Authors 
  and Lead Authors, 515 Contributing Authors, 21 Review Editors and 420 Expert 
  Reviewers.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="3"></a>3</sup></b> Delegations of 99 IPCC member countries 
  participated in the Eighth Session of Working Group I in Shanghai on 17 to 20 
  January 2001. <br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="4"></a>4</sup></b> The IPCC Second Assessment Report is referred 
  to in this Summary for Policymakers as the SAR.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="5"></a>5</sup></b> Generally temperature trends are rounded 
  to the nearest 0.05&deg;C per unit time, the periods often being limited by 
  data availability.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="6"></a>6</sup></b> In general, a 5% statistical significance 
  level is used, and a 95% confidence level.<br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="7"></a>7</sup></b> In this Summary for Policymakers and in 
  the Technical Summary, the following words have been used where appropriate 
  to indicate judgmental estimates of confidence: virtually certain (greater than 
  99% chance that a result is true); very likely (90-99% chance); likely (66-90% 
  chance); medium likelihood (33-66% chance); unlikely (10-33% chance); very unlikely 
  (1-10% chance); exceptionally unlikely (less than 1% chance). The reader is 
  referred to individual chapters for more details. <br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="8"></a>8</sup></b> Radiative forcing is a measure of the influence 
  a factor has in altering the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the 
  Earth-atmosphere system, and is an index of the importance of the factor as 
  a potential climate change mechanism. It is expressed in Watts per square metre 
  (Wm<sup>-2</sup>).<br>
  <br>
  <sup><b><a name="9"></a>9</b></sup> ppm (parts per million) or ppb (parts per 
  billion, 1 billion = 1,000 million) is the ratio of the number of greenhouse 
  gas molecules to the total number of molecules of dry air. For example: 300 
  ppm means 300 molecules of a greenhouse gas per million molecules of dry air. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="10"></a>10</sup></b> Complex physically based climate models 
  are the main tool for projecting future climate change. In order to explore 
  the full range of scenarios, these are complemented by simple climate models 
  calibrated to yield an equivalent response in temperature and sea level to complex 
  climate models. These projections are obtained using a simple climate model 
  whose climate sensitivity and ocean heat uptake are calibrated to each of seven 
  complex climate models. The climate sensitivity used in the simple model ranges 
  from 1.7 to 4.2&deg;C, which is comparable to the commonly accepted range of 
  1.5 to 4.5&deg;C. <br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="11"></a>11</sup></b> This range does not include uncertainties 
  in the modelling of radiative forcing, e.g. aerosol forcing uncertainties. A 
  small carbon-cycle climate feedback is included. <br>
  <br>
  <b><sup><a name="12"></a>12</sup></b> Heat index: A combination of temperature 
  and humidity that measures effects on human comfort. </p>
