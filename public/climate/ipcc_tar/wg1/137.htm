<h4>4.2.1.3 Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)</h4>
<p>The HFCs with the largest measured atmospheric abundances are (in order), HFC-23 
  (CHF<sub>3</sub>), HFC-134a (CF<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>F), and HFC-152a (CH<sub>3</sub>CHF<sub>2</sub>). 
  The recent rises in these HFCs are shown in <a href="#fig43">Figure 4.3</a> 
  along with some major HCFCs, the latter being controlled under the Montreal 
  Protocol and its Amendments. HFC-23 is a by-product of HCFC-22 production. It 
  has a long atmospheric lifetime of 260 years, so that most emissions, which 
  have occurred over the past two decades, will have accumulated in the atmosphere. 
  Between 1978 and 1995, HFC-23 increased from about 3 to 10 ppt; and it continues 
  to rise even more rapidly (Oram et al., 1996). HFC-134a is used primarily as 
  a refrigerant, especially in car air conditioners. It has an atmospheric lifetime 
  of 13.8 years, and its annual emissions have grown from near zero in 1990 to 
  an estimated 0.032 Tg/yr in 1996. The abundance continues to rise almost exponentially 
  as the use of this HFC increases (Montzka et al., 1996b; Oram et al., 1996; 
  Simmonds et al., 1998). HFC-152a is a short-lived gas with a mean atmospheric 
  lifetime of 1.4 years. Its rise has been steady, but its low emissions and a 
  short lifetime have kept its abundance below 1 ppt.</p>
<h4><a name="4214"></a>4.2.1.4 Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride 
  (SF<sub>6</sub>)</h4>
<p>PFCs, in particular CF<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, as well 
  as SF<sub>6</sub> have sources predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere, atmospheric 
  lifetimes longer than 1,000 years, and large absorption cross-sections for terrestrial 
  infra-red radiation. These compounds are far from a steady state between sources 
  and sinks, and even small emissions will contribute to radiative forcing over 
  the next several millennia. Current emissions of C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub> 
  and SF<sub>6</sub> are clearly anthropogenic and well quantified by the accumulating 
  atmospheric burden. Harnisch and Eisenhauer (1998) have shown that CF<sub>4</sub> 
  and SF<sub>6</sub> are naturally present in fluorites, and out-gassing from 
  these materials leads to natural background abundances of 40 ppt for CF<sub>4</sub> 
  and 0.01 ppt for SF<sub>6</sub>. However, at present the anthropogenic emissions 
  of CF<sub>4</sub> exceed the natural ones by a factor of 1,000 or more and are 
  responsible for the rapid rise in atmospheric abundance. Atmospheric burdens 
  of CF<sub>4</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub> are increasing as shown in <a href="138.htm#fig44">Figures 
  4.4</a> and <a href="138.htm#fig45">4.5</a>, respectively. Surface measurements 
  show that SF<sub>6</sub> has increased by about 7%/yr during the 1980s and 1990s 
  (Geller et al., 1997; Maiss and Brenninkmeijer, 1998). Recent relative rates 
  of increase are 1.3%/yr for CF<sub>4</sub> and 3.2%/yr for C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub> 
  (Harnisch et al., 1996). The only important sinks for PFCs and SF<sub>6</sub> 
  are photolysis or ion reactions in the mesosphere. These gases provide useful 
  tracers of atmospheric transport in both troposphere and stratosphere.</p>
<p>A new, long-lived, anthropogenic greenhouse gas has recently been found in 
  the atmosphere (Sturges et al., 2000). Trifluoromethyl sulphur pentafluoride 
  (SF<sub>5</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>) - a hybrid of PFCs and SF<sub>6</sub> not 
  specifically addressed in Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol - has the largest 
  radiative forcing, on a per molecule basis, of any gas found in the atmosphere 
  to date. Its abundance has grown from near zero in the late 1960s to about 0.12 
  ppt in 1999.<a name="fig43"></a> </p>
