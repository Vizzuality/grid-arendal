<h2>6.12 Global Warming Potentials</h2>
<h3><a name="6121"></a>6.12.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>Just as radiative forcing provides a simplified means of comparing the various 
  factors that are believed to influence the climate system to one another, Global 
  Warming Potentials (GWPs) are one type of simplified index based upon radiative 
  properties that can be used to estimate the potential future impacts of emissions 
  of different gases upon the climate system in a relative sense. The formulation 
  of GWPs, reasons for the choice of various time horizons, and the effects of 
  clouds, scenarios, and many other factors upon GWP values were discussed in 
  detail in IPCC (1994). That discussion will not be repeated here. <a href="216.htm">Section 
  6.2</a> discusses the relationship between radiative forcing and climate response 
  and describes recent studies that have supported the view that many different 
  kinds of forcing agents (e.g., various greenhouse gases, sulphate aerosols, 
  solar activity, etc.) yield similar globally averaged climate responses per 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup> of forcing (albeit with different spatial patterns in some important 
  cases). These parallels in global mean climate responses have motivated the 
  use of simplified measures to estimate in an approximate fashion the relative 
  effects of emissions of different gases on climate. The emphasis on relative 
  rather than absolute effects (such as computed temperature change) avoids dependence 
  upon any particular model of climate response.</p>
<p>The impact of greenhouse gas emissions upon the atmosphere is related not only 
  to radiative properties, but also to the time-scale characterising the removal 
  of the substance from the atmosphere. Radiative properties control the absorption 
  of radiation per kilogram of gas present at any instant, but the lifetime (or 
  adjustment time, see <a href="127.htm">Chapter 4</a>) controls how long an emitted 
  kilogram is retained in the atmosphere and hence is able to influence the thermal 
  budget. The climate system responds to changes in the thermal budget on time-scales 
  ranging from the order of months to millennia depending upon processes within 
  the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, etc.<br>
  GWPs are a measure of the relative radiative effect of a given substance compared 
  to another, integrated over a chosen time horizon. The choice of the time horizon 
  depends in part upon whether the user wishes to emphasise shorter-term processes 
  (e.g., responses of cloud cover to surface temperature changes) or longer-term 
  phenomena (such as sea level rise) that are linked to sustained alterations 
  of the thermal budget (e.g., the slow transfer of heat between, for example, 
  the atmosphere and ocean). In addition, if the speed of potential climate change 
  is of greatest interest (rather than the eventual magnitude), then a focus on 
  shorter time horizons can be useful (IPCC, l994; Skodvin and Fuglestvedt, 1997; 
  Fuglestvedt et al., 2000; Smith and Wigley, 2000a,b).</p>
<p>As in previous reports, here we present GWPs for 20, 100, and 500 year time 
  horizons. The most recent GWP evaluations are those of WMO (l999) and the SAR, 
  and the results presented here are drawn in large part from those assessments, 
  with updates for those cases where significantly different new laboratory or 
  radiative transfer results have been published. The sources used for input variables 
  for the GWP calculations are indicated in this section and in the headers and 
  footnotes to the tables, where sources of new estimates since the SAR are identified.</p>
<p>The GWP has been defined as the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing 
  from the instantaneous release of 1 kg of a trace substance relative to that 
  of 1 kg of a reference gas (IPCC, l990):</p>
<p align="center"><a name="equ62"></a><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/equ6-2.gif" width="400" height="121"></p>
<p>where TH is the time horizon over which the calculation is considered, a<sub>x</sub> 
  is the radiative efficiency due to a unit increase in atmospheric abundance 
  of the substance in question (i.e., Wm<sup>-2</sup> kg<sup>-1</sup>), [x(t)] 
  is the time-dependent decay in abundance of the instantaneous release of the 
  substance, and the corresponding quantities for the reference gas are in the 
  denominator. The GWP of any substance therefore expresses the integrated forcing 
  of a pulse (of given small mass) of that substance relative to the integrated 
  forcing of a pulse (of the same mass) of the reference gas over some time horizon. 
  The numerator of <a href="#equ62">Equation 6.2</a> is the absolute (rather than 
  relative) GWP of a given substance, referred to as the AGWP. The GWPs of various 
  greenhouse gases can then be easily compared to determine which will cause the 
  greatest integrated radiative forcing over the time horizon of interest. The 
  direct relative radiative forcings per ppbv are derived from infrared radiative 
  transfer models based on laboratory measurements of the molecular properties 
  of each substance and considering the molecular weights. Updated information 
  since the SAR is presented for many gases in <a href="218.htm">Section 6.3</a>. 
  Many important changes in these quantities were recently reviewed in WMO (l999) 
  and will be briefly summarised here. In addition, some gases can indirectly 
  affect radiative forcing, mainly through chemical processes. For example, tropospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub> provides a significant radiative forcing of the climate system, 
  but its production occurs indirectly, as a result of atmospheric chemistry following 
  emissions of precursors such as NO<sub>x</sub>, CO, and NMHCs (see <a href="228.htm#66">Section 
  6.6</a> and <a href="127.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Indirect effects will be described 
  below for a number of key gases.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the integrated relative effect of an 
  emitted kilogram of gas which is represented by a GWP and the actual radiative 
  forcings for specific gas amounts presented, for example, in <a href="218.htm">Section 
  6.3</a> and in <a href="245.htm#fig66">Figure 6.6</a>. GWPs are intended for 
  use in studying relative rather than absolute impacts of emissions, and pertain 
  to specific time horizons.</p>
<p>The radiative efficiencies ar and a<sub>x</sub> are not necessarily constant 
  over time. While the absorption of infrared radiation by many greenhouse gases 
  varies linearly with their abundance, a few important ones display non-linear 
  behaviour for current and likely future abundances (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, 
  and N<sub>2</sub>O). For those gases, the relative radiative forcing will depend 
  upon abundance and hence upon the future scenario adopted. These issues were 
  discussed in detail and some sensitivities to chosen scenarios were presented 
  in IPCC (l994).</p>
<p>A key aspect of GWP calculations is the choice of the reference gas, taken 
  here to be CO<sub>2</sub>. In IPCC (l994), it was shown, for example, that a 
  particular scenario for future growth of CO<sub>2</sub> (S650, see <a href="095.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>) would change the denominator of <a href="#equ62">Equation 6.2</a> by 
  as much as 15% compared to a calculation employing constant pre-industrial CO<sub>2</sub> 
  mixing ratios.</p>
<p>The atmospheric response time of CO<sub>2</sub> is subject to substantial scientific 
  uncertainties, due to limitations in our knowledge of key processes including 
  its uptake by the biosphere and ocean. When CO<sub>2</sub> is used as the reference, 
  the numerical values of the GWPs of all greenhouse gases can change substantially 
  as research improves the understanding of the removal processes of CO<sub>2</sub>. 
  The removal function for CO<sub>2</sub> used for the GWPs presented here is 
  based upon carbon cycle models such as those discussed in <a href="095.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>. The CO<sub>2</sub> radiative efficiency (a<sub>r</sub>) used in this 
  report has been updated since the SAR, as discussed in <a href="218.htm">Section 
  6.3</a> (see below).</p>
<p>The lifetimes of non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases are dependent largely 
  on atmospheric photochemistry, which controls photo-lysis and related removal 
  processes as discussed in <a href="127.htm">Chapter 4</a>. When the lifetime 
  of the gas in question is comparable to the response time of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  (nominally about 150 years, although it is clear that the removal of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  cannot be adequately described by a single, simple exponential lifetime; see 
  IPCC (l994) and the discussion below), the GWP is relatively insensitive to 
  choice of time horizon, i.e., for N<sub>2</sub>O. When the lifetime of the gas 
  in question differs substantially from the response time of the reference gas, 
  the GWP becomes sensitive to the choice of time horizon, which in turn implies 
  a decision regarding the climate processes and impacts of interest, as noted 
  above. For longer time horizons, those species that decay more rapidly than 
  the reference gas display decreasing GWPs, with the slope of the decay being 
  dependent mainly on the lifetime of the gas in question. Gases with lifetimes 
  much longer than that of the reference gas (e.g., C2F6) display increasing GWPs 
  over long time horizons (i.e., greater than a hundred years). We emphasise that 
  the GWP is an integral from zero to the chosen time horizon; hence the values 
  presented in the table for 25, 100, and 500 years are not additive.</p>
<p>A number of studies have suggested modified or different indices for evaluating 
  relative future climate effects. Here we provide only an indication of the kinds 
  of issues that are being considered in these alternative indices. Wuebbles and 
  Calm (l997) emphasised the fact that some halocarbon substitutes used, for example, 
  in refrigeration are less efficient than the CFCs they are replacing, so that 
  more energy is consumed through their use and hence more CO<sub>2</sub> emitted 
  per hour of operation. Evaluation of these technological factors would only 
  be possible through detailed emission inventories coupled with scenarios, and 
  are not included here. Some studies have argued for use of "discount rates" 
  to reflect increasing uncertainty and changing policies with time (e.g., to 
  account for the possibility that new technologies will emerge to solve problems; 
  see for example Lashof and Ahuja, l990; Reilly et al., l999). Economic factors 
  could be considered along with the technological ones mentioned above, adding 
  another aspect to any scenario. These are not included here. Smith and Wigley 
  (2000a,b), Fuglestvedt et al. (2000), and Reilly et al. (l999) have examined 
  the relationship between GWPs and climate response using simple energy balance 
  models. These studies emphasised the point made above regarding the links between 
  choice of time horizon, lifetime of a particular substance, and the climate 
  response of interest, noting for example that while the 100-year GWP for N<sub>2</sub>O 
  represented the model-calculated temperature responses (both instantaneous and 
  integrated over time), and the calculated sea level rise to good accuracy, that 
  for CH<sub>4</sub> (a short-lived gas with a lifetime of about 10 years) represented 
  sea level rise far better than it did the instantaneous temperature change for 
  that time horizon. For very short-lived gases, GWPs are often calculated using 
  a &#145;slab' (continuous) rather than pulse emission. This approach involves 
  the assumption of specific scenarios for the magnitudes of the slabs. For some 
  very short-lived gases such as NMHCs, models must employ &#145;slab' emissions 
  in GWP analyses since their impact depends critically on non-linear coupled 
  chemical processes. Some examples are given in <a href="249.htm#61232">Sections 
  6.12.3.2</a> and <a href="250.htm#61234">6.12.3.4</a>.</p>
