<h4>13.4.2.1 Incorporation of changes in variability: daily to interannual time-scales</h4>
<p>Changes in variability have not been regularly incorporated in climate scenarios 
  because: (1) less faith has been placed in climate model simulations of changes 
  in variability than of changes in mean climate; (2) techniques for changing 
  variability are more complex than those for incorporating mean changes; and 
  (3) there may have been a perception that changes in means are more important 
  for impacts than changes in variability (Mearns, 1995). Techniques for incorporating 
  changes in variability emerged in the early 1990s (Mearns et al., 1992; Wilks, 
  1992; Woo, 1992; Barrow and Semenov, 1995; Mearns, 1995).</p>
<p>Some relatively simple techniques have been used to incorporate changes in 
  interannual variability alone into scenarios. Such techniques are adequate in 
  cases where the impact models use monthly climate data for input. One approach 
  is to calculate present day and future year-by-year anomalies relative to the 
  modelled baseline period, and to apply these anomalies (at an annual, seasonal 
  or monthly resolution) to the long-term mean observed baseline climate. This 
  produces climate time-series having an interannual variability equivalent to 
  that modelled for the present day and future, both superimposed on the observed 
  baseline climate. The approach was followed in evaluating impacts of variability 
  change on crop yields in Finland (Carter et al., 2000a), and in the formation 
  of climate scenarios for the United States National Assessment, though in the 
  latter case the observed variability was retained for the historical period.</p>
<p>Another approach is to calculate the change in modelled interannual variability 
  between the baseline and future periods, and then to apply it as an inflator 
  or deflator to the observed baseline interannual variability. In this way, modelled 
  changes in interannual variability are carried forward into the climate scenario, 
  but the observed baseline climate still provides the initial definition of variability. 
  This approach was initially developed in Mearns et al. (1992) and has recently 
  been experimented with by Arnell (1999). However, this approach can produce 
  unrealistic features, such as negative precipitation or inaccurate autocorrelation 
  structure of temperature, when applied to climate data on a daily time-scale 
  (Mearns et al., 1996). </p>
<p>The major, most complete technique for producing scenarios with changes in 
  interannual and daily variability involves manipulation of the parameters of 
  stochastic weather generators (defined in <a href="483.htm#1332">Section 13.3.2</a>). 
  These are commonly based either on a Markov chain approach (e.g., Richardson, 
  1981) or a spell length approach (e.g., Racksko et al., 1991), and simulate 
  changes in variability on daily to interannual time-scales (Wilks, 1992). More 
  detailed information on weather generators is provided in <a href="373.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>, <a href="396.htm">Section 10.6.2</a>. </p>
<p>To bring about changes in variability, the parameters of the weather generator 
  are manipulated in ways that alter the daily variance of the variable of concern 
  (usually temperature or precipitation) (Katz, 1996). For precipitation, this 
  usually involves changes in both the frequency and intensity of daily precipitation. 
  By manipulating the parameters on a daily time-scale, changes in variability 
  are also induced on the interannual time-scale (Wilks, 1992). Some weather generators 
  operating at sub-daily time-scales have also been applied to climate scenario 
  generation (e.g., Kilsby et al., 1998).</p>
<p>A number of crop model simulations have been performed to determine the sensitivity 
  of crop yields to incremental changes in daily and interannual variability (Barrow 
  and Semenov, 1995; Mearns, 1995; Mearns et al., 1996; Riha et al., 1996; Wang 
  and Erda, 1996; Vinocur et al., 2000). In most of these studies, changes in 
  variability resulted in significant changes in crop yield. For example, Wang 
  and Erda (1996) combined systematic incremental changes in daily variance of 
  temperature and precipitation with mean climate scenarios in their study of 
  climate change and corn yields in China. They found that increases in the variance 
  of temperature and precipitation combined, further decreased crop yields compared 
  to the effect of the mean change scenarios alone taken from several GCMs. </p>
<p>Studies using the variance changes in addition to mean changes from climate 
  models to form climate scenarios also emerged in the past decade (Kaiser et 
  al., 1993; Bates et al. 1994). For example, Bates et al. (1994, 1996) adapted 
  Wilks' (1992) method and applied it to changes in daily variability from 
  doubled CO<sub>2</sub> runs of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation 
  (CSIRO) climate model (CSIRO9). They then applied the changed time-series to 
  a hydrological model. Combined changes in mean and variability are also evident 
  in a broad suite of statistical downscaling methods (e.g., Katz and Parlange, 
  1996; Wilby et al., 1998). See also <a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>, <a href="397.htm#1063">Section 
  10.6.3</a>, for further discussion of statistical downscaling and changes in 
  variability.</p>
<p>In recent years, more robust and physically meaningful changes in climatic 
  variability on daily to interannual time scales have been found in runs of GCMs 
  and RCMs for some regions (e.g., Gregory and Mitchell, 1995; Mearns et al., 
  1995a,b; Whetton et al., 1998a; Mearns, 1999; Boer et al., 2000). For example, 
  on both daily and interannual time-scales many models simulate temperature variability 
  decreases in winter and increases in summer in northern mid-latitude land areas 
  (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="349.htm">Section 9.3</a>). This 
  result is likely to encourage the further application of model-derived variability 
  changes in climate scenario construction.</p>
<p>The most useful studies, from the point of view of elucidating uncertainty 
  in climate scenarios and impacts, are those that compare applying scenarios 
  with only mean changes to those with mean and variability change. Semenov and 
  Barrow (1997) and Mearns et al. (1997) used mean and variance changes from climate 
  models, formed scenarios of climate change using weather generators and applied 
  them to crop models. In both studies important differences in the impacts of 
  climatic change on crop yields were calculated when including the effect of 
  variance change, compared to only considering mean changes. They identified 
  three key aspects of changed climate relevant to the role played by change in 
  daily to interannual variability of climate: the marginality of the current 
  climate for crop growth, the relative size of the mean and variance changes, 
  and the timing of these changes.</p>
<p>It is difficult to generalise the importance of changes in variability to climate 
  change impacts since significance of changes in variability is region, variable, 
  and resource system specific. For example, based on results of equilibrium control 
  and 2xCO<sub>2</sub> experiments of DARLAM (a regional model developed in Australia) 
  nested within the CSIRO climate model over New South Wales, Whetton et al. (1998a) 
  emphasised that most of the change in temperature extremes they calculated resulted 
  from changes in the mean, not through change in the daily variance. In contrast, 
  Mearns (1999) found large changes (e.g., decreases in winter) in daily variance 
  of temperature in control and 2xCO<sub>2</sub> experiments with a regional climate 
  model (RegCM2) over the Great Plains of the U.S. (Giorgi et al., 1998). These 
  changes were sufficient to make a significant difference in the frequency of 
  daily temperature extremes. Note, however, that these results are not contradictory 
  since they concern two very different regions. More generalised statements may 
  be made regarding the importance of change in the variability of precipitation 
  from climate change experiments for determining changes in the frequency of 
  droughts and floods (e.g., Gregory et al., 1997; Kothavala, 1999). As noted 
  in <a href="338.htm">Chapters 9</a> and <a href="373.htm">10</a>, high intensity 
  rainfall events are expected to increase in general, and precipitation variability 
  would be expected to increase where mean precipitation increases.</p>
<p>Other types of variance changes, on an interannual time-scale, based on changes 
  in major atmospheric circulation oscillations, such as ENSO and North Atlantic 
  Oscillation (NAO), are difficult to incorporate into impact assessments. The 
  importance of the variability of climate associated with ENSO phases for resources 
  systems such as agriculture and water resources have been well demonstrated 
  (e.g., Cane et al., 1994; Chiew et al., 1998; Hansen et al., 1998).</p>
<p>Where ENSO signals are strong, weather generators can be successfully conditioned 
  on ENSO phases; and therein lies the potential for creating scenarios with changes 
  in the frequency of ENSO events. By conditioning on the phases, either discretely 
  (Wang and Connor, 1996) or continuously (Woolhiser et al., 1993), a model can 
  be formed for incorporating changes in the frequency and persistence of such 
  events, which would then induce changes in the daily (and interannual) variability 
  of the local climate sites. Weather generators can also be successfully conditioned 
  using NAO signals (e.g., Wilby, 1998). However, it must be noted that there 
  remains much uncertainty in how events such as ENSO might change with climate 
  change (Knutson, et al., 1997; Timmerman et al., 1999; Walsh et al., 1999; see 
  also <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="359.htm">Section 9.3.5</a>, for 
  further discussion on possible changes in ENSO events). While there is great 
  potential for the use of conditioned stochastic models in creating scenarios 
  of changed variability, to date, no such scenario has actually been applied 
  to an impact model.</p>
