<h2>Executive Summary </h2>
<p><i>The Purpose of Climate Scenarios</i><br>
  A climate scenario is a plausible representation of future climate that has 
  been constructed for explicit use in investigating the potential impacts of 
  anthropogenic climate change. Climate scenarios often make use of climate projections 
  (descriptions of the modelled response of the climate system to scenarios of 
  greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations), by manipulating model outputs and 
  combining them with observed climate data. </p>
<p>This new chapter for the IPCC assesses the methods used to develop climate 
  scenarios. Impact assessments have a very wide range of scenario requirements, 
  ranging from global mean estimates of temperature and sea level, through continental-scale 
  descriptions of changes in mean monthly climate, to point or catchment-level 
  detail about future changes in daily or even sub-daily climate.</p>
<p>The science of climate scenario development acts as an important bridge from 
  the climate science of Working Group I to the science of impact, adaptation 
  and vulnerability assessment, considered by Working Group II. It also has a 
  close dependence on emissions scenarios, which are discussed by Working Group 
  III.</p>
<p><i>Methods for Constructing Scenarios</i><br>
  Useful information about possible future climates and their impacts has been 
  obtained using various scenario construction methods. These include climate 
  model based approaches, temporal and spatial analogues, incremental scenarios 
  for sensitivity studies, and expert judgement. This chapter identifies advantages 
  and disadvantages of these different methods (see <a href="478.htm#tab131">Table 
  13.1</a>).</p>
<p>All these methods can continue to serve a useful role in the provision of scenarios 
  for impact assessment, but it is likely that the major advances in climate scenario 
  construction will be made through the refinement and extension of climate model 
  based approaches.</p>
<p>Each new advance in climate model simulations of future climate has stimulated 
  new techniques for climate scenario construction. There are now numerous techniques 
  available for scenario construction, the majority of which ultimately depend 
  upon results obtained from general circulation model (GCM) experiments. </p>
<p><i>Representing the Cascade of Uncertainty</i><br>
  Uncertainties will remain inherent in predicting future climate change, even 
  though some uncertainties are likely to be narrowed with time. Consequently, 
  a range of climate scenarios should usually be considered in conducting impact 
  assessments.</p>
<p>There is a cascade of uncertainties in future climate predictions which includes 
  unknown future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, the conversion of 
  emissions to atmospheric concentrations and to radiative forcing of the climate, 
  modelling the response of the climate system to forcing, and methods for regionalising 
  GCM results.</p>
<p>Scenario construction techniques can be usefully contrasted according to the 
  sources of uncertainty that they address and those that they ignore. These techniques, 
  however, do not always provide consistent results. For example, simple methods 
  based on direct GCM changes often represent model-to-model differences in simulated 
  climate change, but do not address the uncertainty associated with how these 
  changes are expressed at fine spatial scales. With regionalisation approaches, 
  the reverse is often true.</p>
<p>A number of methods have emerged to assist with the quantification and communication 
  of uncertainty in climate scenarios. These include pattern-scaling techniques 
  to inter-polate/extrapolate between results of model experiments, climate scenario 
  generators, risk assessment frameworks and the use of expert judgement. The 
  development of new or refined scenario construction techniques that can account 
  for multiple uncertainties merits further investigation.</p>
<p><i>Representing High Spatial and Temporal Resolution Information</i><br>
  The incorporation of climate changes at high spatial (e.g., tens of kilometres) 
  and temporal (e.g., daily) resolution in climate scenarios currently remains 
  largely within the research domain of climate scenario development. Scenarios 
  containing such high resolution information have not yet been widely used in 
  comprehensive policy relevant impact assessments.</p>
<p>Preliminary evidence suggests that coarse spatial resolution AOGCM (Atmosphere-Ocean 
  General Circulation Model) information for impact studies needs to be used cautiously 
  in regions characterised by pronounced sub-GCM grid scale variability in forcings. 
  The use of suitable regionalisation techniques may be important to enhance the 
  AOGCM results over such regions.</p>
<p>Incorporating higher resolution information in climate scenarios can substantially 
  alter the assessment of impacts. The incorporation of such information in scenarios 
  is likely to become increasingly common and further evaluation of the relevant 
  methods and their added value in impact assessment is warranted. </p>
<p><i>Representing Extreme Events</i><br>
  Extreme climate/weather events are very important for most climate change impacts. 
  Changes in the occurrence and intensity of extremes should be included in climate 
  scenarios whenever possible.<br>
  Some extreme events are easily or implicitly incorporated in climate scenarios 
  using conventional techniques. It is more difficult to produce scenarios of 
  complex events, such as tropical cyclones and ice storms, which may require 
  specialised techniques. This constitutes an important methodological gap in 
  scenario development. The large uncertainty regarding future changes in some 
  extreme events exacerbates the difficulty in incorporating such changes in climate 
  scenarios.</p>
<p><i>Applying Climate Scenarios in Impact Assessments</i><br>
  There is no single "best" scenario construction method appropriate 
  for all applications. In each case, the appropriate method is determined by 
  the context and the application of the scenario.</p>
<p>The choice of method constrains the sources of uncertainty that can be addressed. 
  Relatively simple techniques, such as those that rely on scaled or unscaled 
  GCM changes, may well be the most appropriate for applications in integrated 
  assessment modelling or for informing policy; more sophisticated techniques, 
  such as regional climate modelling or conditioned stochastic weather generation, 
  are often necessary for applications involving detailed regional modelling of 
  climate change impacts.</p>
<p><i>Improving Information Required for Scenario Development</i><br>
  Improvements in global climate modelling will bring a variety of benefits to 
  most climate scenario development methods. A more diverse set of model experiments, 
  such as AOGCMs run under a broader range of forcings and at higher resolutions, 
  and regional climate models run either in ensemble mode or for longer time periods, 
  will allow a wider range of uncertainty to be represented in climate scenarios. 
  In addition, incorporation of some of the physical, biological and socio-economic 
  feedbacks not currently simulated in global models will improve the consistency 
  of different scenario elements.</p>
