<h3>6.7.6 Mineral Dust Aerosol</h3>
<p>Recent studies have suggested that 20% (Sokolik and Toon, 1996) and up to 30 
  to 50% (Tegen and Fung, 1995) of the total mineral dust in the atmosphere originates 
  from anthropogenic activities, the precise fraction of mineral dust of anthropogenic 
  origin being extremely difficult to determine. Only the radiative forcing from 
  this anthropogenic component is considered as there is no evidence that the 
  naturally occurring component has changed since 1750, although ice core measurements 
  suggest that atmospheric concentrations of dust have varied substantially over 
  longer time-scales (e.g., Petit, 1990). Because mineral dust particles are of 
  a relatively large size and because it becomes lofted to high altitudes in the 
  troposphere, in addition to the short-wave radiative forcing, it may exert a 
  significant long-wave radiative forcing. The global mean short-wave radiative 
  forcing will be negative due to the predominantly scattering nature in the solar 
  spectrum (although partial absorption may lead to a local positive radiative 
  forcing over high surface albedos and clouds) and the global mean long-wave 
  forcing will be positive.</p>
<p>Sokolik and Toon (1996) used a simple box model and neglected forcing in cloudy 
  regions to estimate a short-wave radiative forcing of -0.25 Wm<sup>-2</sup> over ocean 
  and -0.6 Wm<sup>-2</sup> over land, leading to a global forcing of approximately -0.46 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup>. They point out that this is offset to some extent by a positive long-wave 
  forcing. Tegen and Fung (1995) performed a more detailed three-dimensional GCM 
  modelling study of dust aerosol and estimated that approximately 30 to 50% of 
  the total dust burden is due to changes in land use associated with anthropogenic 
  activity. The radiative forcing using this data was estimated by Tegen et al. 
  (1996) to be -0.25 Wm<sup>-2</sup> in the short-wave and +0.34 Wm<sup>-2</sup> in the long-wave, resulting 
  in a net radiative forcing of +0.09 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. Updated calculations of the net radiative 
  forcing based on Miller and Tegen (1998) estimate the radiative forcing to be 
  -0.22 Wm<sup>-2</sup> in the short-wave and +0.16 Wm<sup>-2</sup> in the long-wave, resulting in a 
  net radiative forcing of -0.06 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. Hansen et al. (1998) perform similar calculations 
  and calculate a net radiative forcing of -0.12 Wm<sup>-2</sup> by assuming a different 
  vertical distribution, different optical parameters and using a different global 
  model. Jacobson (2001) used a multi-component global aerosol model to estimate 
  the direct radiative forcing to be -0.062 Wm<sup>-2</sup> in the short-wave and +0.05 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup> in the long-wave, resulting in a net radiative forcing of -0.012 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. 
  The effects of non-sphericity of the mineral dust are not accounted for in these 
  calculations. Mishchenko et al. (1997) suggest that differences in the optical 
  parameters between model spheroids and actual dust particles do not exceed 10 
  to 15%, although changes of this magnitude may have a large effect on the radiative 
  forcing (Miller and Tegen, 1998). An example of the geographical distribution 
  of the radiative forcing is shown in <a href="253.htm#fig67">Figure 6.7g</a> 
  (data from Tegen et al., 1996) which shows regions of positive and negative 
  forcing. Positive forcing tends to exist over regions of high surface reflectance 
  and negative radiative forcings tend to exist over areas of low surface reflectance. 
  This is due to the dependency of the forcing on surface reflectance and the 
  additional effects of the long-wave radiative forcing.</p>
<p>One problem that needs to be solved is uncertainty in representative refractive 
  indices (Claquin et al., 1998), and how they vary geographically due to different 
  mineral composition of different source regions (e.g., Lindberg et al., 1976). 
  Sokolik et al. (1993) summarise the imaginary part of the refractive index for 
  different geographic regions finding a range (-0.003i to approximately -0.02i) 
  at a wavelength of 0.55 &micro;m, and differences in refractive index in the 
  long-wave from different geographical sources are also reported by Sokolik et 
  al. (1998). Kaufman et al. (2001) use observations from the Landsat satellite 
  coupled with ground-based sun photometer measurements and suggest that Saharan 
  dust has a smaller imaginary refractive index (-0.001i) at 0.55 &micro;m and 
  absorbs less solar radiation than that used in the above modelling studies leading 
  to a much enhanced shortwave radiative forcing. However, the increase is much 
  less in the modelling study of Hansen et al. (1998) who find the net radiative 
  forcing changes from -0.12 Wm<sup>-2</sup> to -0.53 Wm<sup>-2</sup> when dust is treated as conservatively 
  scattering. von Hoyningen-Huene et al. (1999) determine the imaginary part of 
  the refractive index from surface based absorption and scattering measurements 
  and find that a refractive index of -0.005i best fits the observations for Saharan 
  dust, which is in agreement with the values reported by Sokolik et al. (1993). 
  The refractive indices together with the assumed size distributions determine 
  the optical parameters. The radiative forcing is particularly sensitive to the 
  single scattering albedo (Miller and Tegen, 1999). Additional uncertainties 
  lie in modelling the size distributions (Tegen and Lacis, 1996; Claquin et al., 
  1998) which, together with the refractive indices, determine the optical parameters. 
  Measurements made by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) by 
  Ackerman and Chung (1992), showed a local short-wave radiative perturbation 
  off the west coast of Africa of -40 to -90 Wm<sup>-2</sup> and a corresponding long-wave 
  perturbation of +5 to +20 Wm<sup>-2</sup> at the top of the atmosphere. Relating instantaneous 
  observational measurements that do not account for the effects of clouds, diurnal 
  averaging of the radiation, the seasonal signal associated with emissions and 
  the fraction of mineral dust that is anthropogenic to the global mean radiative 
  forcing is very difficult. Because the resultant global mean net radiative forcing 
  is a residual obtained by summing the short-wave and the long-wave radiative 
  forcings which are of roughly comparable magnitudes, the uncertainty in the 
  radiative forcing is large and even the sign is in doubt due to the competing 
  nature of the short-wave and long-wave effects. The studies above suggest, on 
  balance, that the shortwave radiative forcing is likely to be of a larger magnitude 
  than the long-wave radiative forcing, which indicates that the net radiative 
  forcing is likely to be negative, although a net positive radiative forcing 
  cannot be ruled out. Therefore a tentative range of -0.6 to +0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup> is adopted; 
  a best estimate cannot be assigned as yet.</p>
