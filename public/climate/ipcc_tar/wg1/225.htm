<h2>6.5 Radiative Forcing by Tropospheric Ozone</h2>
<h3><a name="651"></a>6.5.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>Human activities have long been known to influence tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>, 
  not only in urban areas where O<sub>3</sub> is a major component of &#145;smog', 
  but also in the remote atmosphere (e.g., IPCC, l990, l994; the SAR and references 
  therein). The current state of scientific understanding of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  chemistry and trends is reviewed in <a href="127.htm">Chapter 4</a> of this 
  report, where it is emphasised that tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> has an average 
  lifetime of the order of weeks. This relatively short lifetime implies that 
  the distribution of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>, as well as the trends in that 
  distribution (which in turn lead to radiative forcing) are highly variable in 
  space and time. Studies relating to the evaluation of radiative forcing due 
  to estimated tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> increases since pre-industrial times 
  are discussed here. While there are a number of sites where high quality surface 
  measurements of O<sub>3</sub> have been obtained for a few decades, there are 
  fewer locations where ozonesonde data allow study of the vertical distribution 
  of the trends, and fewer still with records prior to about l970. A limited number 
  of surface measurements in Europe date back to the late l9th century. These 
  suggest that O<sub>3</sub> has more than tripled in the 20th century there (Marenco 
  et al., l994). The lack of global information on pre-industrial tropospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub> distributions is, however, a major uncertainty in the evaluation 
  of the forcing of this key gas (see <a href="127.htm">Chapter 4</a>).</p>
<p>Biomass burning plays a significant role in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> production and 
  hence in tropical radiative forcing over large spatial scales, particularly 
  in the tropical Atlantic west of the coast of Africa (e.g., Fishman, l99l; Fishman 
  and Brackett, l997; Portmann et al., l997; Hudson and Thompson, l998) and in 
  Indonesia (Hauglustaine et al., l999). Export of industrial pollution to the 
  Arctic can lead to increased O<sub>3</sub> over a highly reflective snow or ice surface, 
  and correspondingly large local radiative forcings (Hauglustaine et al., 1998; 
  Mickley et al., 1999).</p>
<p><a href="127.htm">Chapter 4</a> and <a href="229.htm">Sections 6.6.2</a> and 
  <a href="230.htm">6.6.3</a> discuss the chemistry responsible for the tropospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub> forcing; here we emphasise that the tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  forcing is driven by and broadly attributable to emissions of other gases. The 
  observed regional variability of O<sub>3</sub> trends is related to the transport 
  of key precursors, particularly reactive nitrogen, CO, and NMHCs (see <a href="127.htm">Chapter 
  4</a>). However, the chemistry of O<sub>3</sub> production can be non-linear, 
  so that increased emissions of, for example, the nitric oxide precursor do not 
  necessarily lead to linear responses in O<sub>3</sub> concentrations over all 
  ranges of likely values (e.g, Kleinman, l994; Klonecki and Levy, l997). Further, 
  the relationship of precursor emissions to O<sub>3</sub> trends may also vary 
  in time. One study suggests that the O<sub>3</sub> production efficiency per 
  mole of nitrogen oxide emitted has decreased globally by a factor of two since 
  pre-industrial times (Wang and Jacob, l998). Because of these complex and poorly 
  understood interactions, the forcing due to tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> trends 
  cannot be reliably and uniquely attributed in a quantitative fashion to the 
  emissions of specific precursors.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this report, several evaluations of the global radiative 
  forcing due to tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> changes since pre-industrial times have been 
  intercompared. It will be shown that the uncertainties in radiative forcing 
  can be better understood when both the absolute radiative forcing (Wm<sup>-2</sup>) and 
  normalised forcing (Wm<sup>-2</sup> per Dobson Unit of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> change) are considered. 
  The results of this intercomparison and the availability of numerous models 
  using different approaches suggest reduced uncertainties in the radiative forcing 
  estimates compared to those of the SAR. Furthermore, recent work has shown that 
  the dependence of the forcing on the altitude where the O<sub>3</sub> changes occur within 
  the troposphere is less pronounced than previously thought, providing improved 
  scientific understanding. Finally, some estimates of the likely magnitude of 
  future tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> radiative forcing are presented and discussed.</p>
