<h3>7.3.5 Flows over Sills and through Straits</h3>
<p>The water mass structure in the deep ocean is largely dominated by the flows 
  across a few shallow sills and through straits. The role of such flows for climate 
  change arises from their influence on the THC which in turn can affect surface 
  conditions. Once water has crossed a sill, it descends the continental slope 
  as a dense gravity current and provides the water source for the downstream 
  basin. The water mass properties are determined by the entrainment of and mixing 
  with ambient water (Baringer and Price, 1997). For the NADW which is at the 
  heart of the sinking branch of the global conveyor, the overflow of cold water 
  across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland ridge is the principal source. Observations 
  show intense flow with speeds up to 1 m/s, in a layer of less than 100 m thickness 
  above the bottom and within 20 km of the continental slope. Model calculations 
  suggest that an interruption of this overflow would lead to a breakdown of the 
  Atlantic THC and the associated heat transport within less than a decade (D&ouml;scher 
  et al., 1994). In the past decades the overflow appears to have been fairly 
  steady. Another prominent feature is the Indonesian Throughflow which has substantial 
  contributions to the variability of the THC and heat transport in the Indian 
  Ocean (Godfrey, 1996).</p>
<p> In coarse and medium resolution climate models, the overflow across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland 
  ridge has been found to be highly sensitive to the precise geometry used. For 
  example, changes in topography by as little as one grid cell resulted in gross 
  changes not only to the amount of cross-ridge flux but also to its location, 
  and to the composition of the water mass actually crossing the sill. Thus, a 
  50% change in heat flux at the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland ridge latitude could 
  be achieved in a model by the addition or subtraction of a single grid box (Roberts 
  and Wood, 1997). Even eddy-permitting simulations give flows through sills which 
  are very sensitive to model details (Willebrand et al., 2001). The physical 
  processes involve hydraulic control and are not properly represented in climate 
  models, and it is unclear whether a situation with substantial overflow changes 
  can be modelled correctly. Parametrizations for the flux across a sill are only 
  available for the simplest process models (Killworth, 1994; Pratt and Chechelnitsky, 
  1997) that do not include mixing or unsteadiness, both of which are known to 
  be important at sills (Spall and Price, 1998).</p>
<p> Climate models which are based on depth co-ordinates obtain far too much mixing 
  near a sill. This is caused by both poor mixing parametrizations in such models 
  and by excessive diapycnal mixing resulting from the &#145;staircase'-like 
  representation of bottom topography. As a result, water mass structure downstream 
  of a sill is poorly represented in climate models. Isopycnic models are free 
  of this erroneous mixing, and addition of Richardson number dependent mixing 
  to such models results in realistic tongues of dense water moving downslope, 
  mixing at a rate consistent with observations (Hallberg, 2000). A promising 
  new development is the explicit description of the turbulent bottom boundary 
  layer in climate models which yields more realistic flow of dense water down 
  slopes (Beckmann and D&ouml;scher, 1997; Killworth and Edwards, 1999).</p>
<p> In summary, the uncertainties in the representation of the flows across the 
  Greenland-Iceland-Scotland ridge limit the ability of models to simulate situations 
  that involve a rapid change in the THC.</p>
