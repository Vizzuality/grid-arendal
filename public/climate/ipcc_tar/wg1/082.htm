<h3><a name="255"></a>2.5.5 Clouds</h3>
<p>Clouds are important in the Earth's climate system because of their effects 
  on solar radiation, terrestrial radiation and precipitation. Different cloud 
  types contribute to total cloud amount and are associated with a wide variety 
  of thermal and dynamic processes in the climate system (see <a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>, <a href="271.htm">Section 7.2.2</a>). Therefore knowing the variations 
  in total cloud amount and different cloud types would significantly contribute 
  to improving our understanding of the role of clouds in contemporary climate 
  change. Several analyses of cloud amounts for regions of the world have been 
  performed since the SAR. Problems with data homogeneity, particularly concerning 
  biases with changing times of observation (Sun and Groisman, 2000; Sun et al., 
  2001) have been addressed in several studies, but other issues continue to be 
  a source of uncertainty. </p>
<h4><a name="2551"></a>2.5.5.1 Land</h4>
<p>Dai et al. (1997a, 1999) and Kaiser (1998) examined cloud 
  cover changes over the former USSR and China during the last four to five decades, 
  to add to earlier analyses for Europe, the United States, Canada, and Australia 
  by Henderson-Sellers (1992) and Karl and Steurer (1990). These studies show 
  20th century increases in cloud cover over much of the United States (mostly 
  confined to the first 80 years) and the former USSR, which are significantly 
  negatively correlated with changes in the diurnal range of surface air temperature 
  (DTR) (as shown earlier in <a href="054.htm#fig23">Figure 2.3</a>). Sun and 
  Groisman (2000) showed that in the former USSR low-level cloud cover significantly 
  decreased during the period 1936 to 1990. However, this was more than offset 
  by a significant increase in cumulus and cirrus clouds during the past several 
  decades. Over much of China, however, daytime and night-time total cloud cover 
  exhibited significant decreasing trends of 1 to 2% sky cover/decade for both 
  day and night observations between 1951 and 1994 (Kaiser, 1998, 2000), which 
  the DTR failed to follow (<a href="054.htm#fig23">Figure 2.3</a>). This discrepancy 
  may result from the increasing effect of industrial aerosols on the DTR since 
  the late 1970s (Dai et al., 1999). Tuomenvirta et al. (2000) show increasing 
  trends in cloud cover during the period 1910 to 1995 for northern Europe, which 
  are consistent with decreases in the DTR. A new analysis (Neff, 1999) reveals 
  a dramatic increase (15 to 20%) of spring and summer cloud amount at the South 
  Pole during the past four decades in this region. This appears to be related 
  to the observed delay in the breakdown of the spring polar vortex and is believed 
  to be related to decreases in stratospheric temperatures.</p>
<p>There are few analyses of the amounts of various cloud types or changes over 
  the tropics and sub-tropics. Correlations with observed precipitation and clouds 
  observed by satellites suggest that much of the increase in the total cloud 
  amount is likely to have resulted from increases in thick, precipitating clouds 
  (Dai et al., 1997a). Hahn et al. (1996) show decreasing decadal scale trends 
  in cloud cover over much of China, as well as over most of South America and 
  Africa for the period 1971 to 1991. The latter two areas have little surface-based 
  information.</p>
<h4><a name="2552"></a>2.5.5.2 Ocean </h4>
<p>The SAR presented analyses of inter-decadal changes in marine cloud coverage. 
  The data have now been re-examined and doubt has been cast on some of the previous 
  findings (Bajuk and Leovy, 1998a; Norris, 1999). Additional data have also reversed 
  some of the previous trends. In the SAR a 3% increase in cumulonimbus clouds 
  was reported for the period 1952 to 1981. An update of this analysis showed 
  a gradual rise in cumulonimbus cloud amount from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s, 
  with a gradual decline thereafter (Bajuk and Leovy, 1998a). Bajuk and Leovy 
  (1998b) cast doubt on the homogeneity of the cloud amounts derived from ship 
  data. They find that inter-decadal variations of the frequency of occurrence 
  of cloud amount for a given cloud type are generally unrelated to similar time-scale 
  variations in SST and large-scale divergence of the surface winds. Nonetheless, 
  some regional changes and variations based on ship reports of low and middle 
  clouds are likely to be rather robust. Variations in these categories of cloud 
  are consistent with variations of other climate system variables. Examples include: 
  (1) a long-term upward trend in altostratus and nimbostratus across the mid-latitude 
  North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans (Parungo et al., 1994; Norris and Leovy, 
  1995); (2) ENSO related variations in the frequency of low cloud types across 
  the Pacific and Indian Oceans (Bajuk and Leovy, 1998b); and (3) interannual 
  variations in summer season stratiform clouds across the North Pacific (Norris 
  et al., 1998). Norris (1999) found an increase in total sky cover of approximately 
  2%, and an increase of approximately 4% in low cloud cover in his analyses of 
  ship reports between 1952 and 1995. He finds no evidence for changes in observation 
  practices that may have affected these trends. The trends are dominated by a 
  globally consistent mode and are as large or larger in the tropics and Southern 
  Hemisphere as in the Northern Hemisphere. This argues against attribution to 
  increased anthropogenic aerosol amounts. </p>
<h4><a name="2553"></a>2.5.5.3 Global</h4>
<p>Although satellite estimates of changes and variations in cloud amount and 
  type contain systematic biases, Rossow and Schiffer (1999) showed improved calibration 
  and cloud detection sensitivities for the International Satellite Cloud Climatology 
  Program (ISCCP) data set. Using data from 1983 to 1994, a globally increasing 
  trend in monthly mean cloudiness reversed during the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
  There now appears to be an overall trend toward reduced total cloud amounts 
  over both land and ocean during this period. An estimate for aircraft-induced 
  cirrus cover for the late 1990s ranges from 0 to 0.2% of the surface of the 
  Earth (IPCC, 1999). </p>
<h3><a name="256"></a>2.5.6 Summary</h3>
<p>Since the SAR, land surface precipitation has continued to increase in the 
  Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes; over the sub-tropics, the drying 
  trend has been ameliorated somewhat. Where data are available, changes in annual 
  streamflow relate well to changes in total precipitation. Over the Southern 
  Hemisphere land areas no pronounced changes in total precipitation are evident 
  since the SAR. The changes in precip-itation in mid- and high latitudes over 
  land have a strong correl-ation with long-term changes in total cloud amount. 
  Little can be said about changes in ocean precipitation as satellite data sets 
  have not yet been adequately tested for time-dependent biases. Changes in water 
  vapour have been analysed most for selected Northern Hemisphere regions, and 
  show an emerging pattern of surface and tropospheric water vapour increases 
  over the past few decades, although there are still untested or uncorrected 
  biases in these data. Limited data from the stratosphere also suggest increases 
  in water vapour but this result must be viewed with great caution. Over land, 
  an increase in cloud cover of a few per cent since the turn of the century is 
  observed, which is shown to closely relate to changes in the diurnal temperature 
  range. Changes in ocean cloud amount and type show systematic increases of a 
  few per cent since the 1950s, but these relate poorly to SST or surface wind 
  divergence changes, casting some doubt on the integrity of the trends. No changes 
  in observing practices can be identified, however, that might have led to time-dependent 
  biases in the ocean cloud amount and frequency statistics.</p>
