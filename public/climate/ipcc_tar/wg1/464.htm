      <b>Figure 12.13:</b> Global mean temperature in the decade 2036 to 2046 
      (relative to pre-industrial, in response to greenhouse gas and sulphate 
      aerosol forcing following the IS92a (IPCC, 1992) scenario), based on original 
      model simulations (squares) and after scaling to fit the observed signal 
      as in <a href="463.htm#fig1212">Figure 12.12(a)</a> (diamonds), with 5 to 
      95% confidence intervals. While the original projections vary (depending, 
      for example, on each model's climate sensitivity), the scale should 
      be independent of errors in both sensitivity and rate of oceanic heat uptake,

      and sulphate forcing. G shows the impact of setting the sulphate forcing 
      to zero but correcting the response to be consistent with observed 20th 
      century climate change. G&amp;S indicates greenhouse and sulphate responses 
      estimated separately (in which case the result is also approximately independent, 
      under this forcing scenario, to persistent errors in the sulphate forcing 
      and response) and G&amp;S&amp;N indicates greenhouse, sulphate and natural 
      responses estimated separately (showing the small impact of natural forcing

<p><i><a name="fig1213"></a>Estimation of uncertainty in predictions</i><br>
  The scaling factors derived from optimal detection can also be used to constrain 
  predictions of future climate change resulting from anthropogenic emissions 
  (Allen et al., 2000b). The best guess scaling and uncertainty limits for each 
  component can be applied to the model predictions, providing objective uncertainty 
  limits that are based on observations. These estimates are independent of possible 
  errors in the individual model's climate sensitivity and time-scale of 
  oceanic adjustment, provided these errors are persistent over time. An example 
  based on the IS92a (IPCC, 1992) GS scenario (whose exact forcing varies between 
  models, see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a> 
  for details) is shown in <a href="#fig1213">Figure 12.13</a> based on a limited 
  number of model simulations. Note that in each case, the original warming predicted 
  by the model lies in the range consistent with the observations. A rate of warming 
  of 0.1 to 0.2&deg;C/decade is likely over the first few decades of the 21st 
  century under this scenario. Allen et al. (2000b) quote a 5 to 95% ("very 
  likely") uncertainty range of 0.11 to 0.24&deg;C/decade for the decades 
  1996 to 2046 under the IS92a scenario, but, given the uncertainties and assumptions 
  behind their analysis, the more cautious "likely" qualifier is used 
  here. For comparison, the simple model tuned to the results of seven AOGCMs 
  used for projections in <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a> gives a range of 0.12 
  to 0.22&deg;C/decade under the IS92a scenario, although it should be noted that 
  this similarity may reflect some cancellation of errors and equally good agreement 
  between the two approaches should not be expected for all scenarios, nor for 
  time-scales longer than the few decades for which the Allen et al. (2000b) approach 
  is valid. <a href="#fig1213">Figure 12.13</a> also shows that a similar range 
  of uncertainty is obtained if the greenhouse gas and sulphate components are 
  estimated separately, in which case the estimate of future warming for this 
  particular scenario is independent of possible errors in the amplitude of the 
  sulphate forcing and response. Most of the recent emission scenarios indicate 
  that future sulphate emissions will decrease rather than increase in the near 
  future. This would lead to a larger global warming since the greenhouse gas 
  component would no longer be reduced by sulphate forcing at the same rate as 
  in the past. The level of uncertainty also increases (see Allen et al., 2000b). 
  The final error bar in <a href="#fig1213">Figure 12.13</a> shows that including 
  the model-simulated response to natural forcing over the 20th century into the 
  analysis has little impact on the estimated anthropogenic warming in the 21st 
  century.</p>
<p>It must be stressed that the approach illustrated in <a href="#fig1213">Figure 
  12.13</a> only addresses the issue of uncertainty in the large-scale climate 
  response to a particular scenario of future greenhouse gas concentrations. This 
  is only one of many interlinked uncertainties in the climate projection problem, 
  as illustrated in <a href="474.htm">Chapter 13</a>, <a href="477.htm#fig132">Figure 
  13.2</a>. Research efforts to attach probabilities to climate projections and 
  scenarios are explored in <a href="474.htm">Chapter 13</a>, <a href="496.htm">Section 
  13.5.2.3</a>.</p>
<p>Forest et al. (2000) used simulations with an intermediate complexity climate 
  model in a related approach. They used optimal detection results following the 
  procedure of Allen and Tett (1999) to rule out combinations of model parameters 
  that yield simulations that are not consistent with observations. They find 
  that low values of the climate sensitivity (&lt;1&deg;C) are consistently ruled 
  out, but the upper bound on climate sensitivity and the rate of ocean heat uptake 
  remain very uncertain. </p>
<p><i>Other space-time approaches</i><br>
  North and Stevens (1998) use a space-frequency method that is closely related 
  to the space-time approach used in the studies discussed above (see <a href="469.htm">Appendix 
  12.2</a>). They analyse 100-year surface temperature time-series of grid box 
  mean surface temperatures in a global network of thirty six large (10&deg;x10&deg;) 
  grid boxes for greenhouse gas, sulphate aerosol, volcanic and solar cycle signals 
  in the frequency band with periods between about 8 and 17 years. The signal 
  patterns were derived from simulations with an EBM (see <a href="447.htm">Section 
  12.2.3</a>). The authors found highly significant responses to greenhouse gas, 
  sulphate aerosol, and volcanic forcing in the observations. Some uncertainty 
  in their conclusions arises from model uncertainty (see discussion in <a href="447.htm">Section 
  12.2.3</a>) and from the use of control simulations from older AOGCMs, which 
  had relatively low variability, for the estimation of internal climate variability. 
</p>
<p>A number of papers extend and analyse the North and Stevens (1998) approach. 
  Kim and Wu (2000) extend the methodology to data with higher (monthly) time 
  resolution and demonstrate that this may improve the detectability of climate 
  change signals. Leroy (1998) casts the results from North and Stevens (1998) 
  in a Bayesian framework. North and Wu (2001) modified the method to perform 
  space-time (rather than space-frequency) detection in the 100-year record. Their 
  results are broadly similar to those of Tett et al., (1999), Stott et al. (2001) 
  and North and Stevens (1998). However, their best guess includes a small sulphate 
  aerosol signal countered by a relatively small, but highly significant, greenhouse 
  gas signal.</p>
<p>All of the space-time and space-frequency optimal detection studies to date 
  indicate a discernible human influence on global climate and yield better-constrained 
  estimates of the magnitude of anthropogenic signals than approaches using spatial 
  information alone. In particular, the inclusion of temporal information can 
  reduce the degeneracy that may occur when more than one climate signal is included. 
  Thus, results from time-space methods generally detect anthropogenic signals 
  even if natural forcings are estimated simultaneously and show that the combination 
  of natural signals and internal variability is inconsistent with the observed 
  surface temperature record.</p>
