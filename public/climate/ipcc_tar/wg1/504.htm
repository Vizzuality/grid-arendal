<h3>14.2.2 Predictability in a Chaotic System</h3>
<p>The climate system is particularly challenging since it is known that components 
  in the system are inherently chaotic; there are feedbacks that could potentially 
  switch sign, and there are central processes that affect the system in a complicated, 
  non-linear manner. These complex, chaotic, non-linear dynamics are an inherent 
  aspect of the climate system. As the IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 
  1996) (hereafter SAR) has previously noted, "future unexpected, large and 
  rapid climate system changes (as have occurred in the past) are, by their nature, 
  difficult to predict. This implies that future climate changes may also involve 
  &#145;surprises'. In particular, these arise from the non-linear, chaotic 
  nature of the climate system &#133; Progress can be made by investigating non-linear 
  processes and sub-components of the climatic system." These thoughts are 
  expanded upon in this report: "Reducing uncertainty in climate projections 
  also requires a better understanding of these non-linear processes which give 
  rise to thresholds that are present in the climate system. Observations, palaeoclimatic 
  data, and models suggest that such thresholds exist and that transitions have 
  occurred in the past &#133; Comprehensive climate models in conjunction with 
  sustained observational systems, both in situ and remote, are the only tool 
  to decide whether the evolving climate system is approaching such thresholds. 
  Our knowledge about the processes, and feedback mechanisms determining them, 
  must be significantly improved in order to extract early signs of such changes 
  from model simulations and observations." (See <a href="306.htm">Chapter 
  7, Section 7.7</a>).</p>
<h4>14.2.2.1 Initialisation and flux adjustments<a name="14221"></a></h4>
<p>Integrations of models over long time-spans are prone to error as small discrepancies 
  from reality compound. Models, by definition, are reduced descriptions of reality 
  and hence incomplete and with error. Missing pieces and small errors can pose 
  difficulties when models of sub-systems such as the ocean and the atmosphere 
  are coupled. As noted in <a href="315.htm#842">Chapter 8, Section 8.4.2</a>, 
  at the time of the SAR most coupled models had difficulty in reproducing a stable 
  climate with current atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, and therefore 
  non-physical "flux adjustment terms" were added. In the past few years 
  significant progress has been achieved, but difficulties posed by the problem 
  of flux adjustment, while reduced, remain problematic and continued investigations 
  are needed to reach the objective of avoiding dependence on flux adjustment 
  (see <a href="315.htm#842">Chapter 8, Section 8.4.2</a>; see also <a href="316.htm#8511">Section 
  8.5.1.1</a>).</p>
<p>Another important (and related) challenge is the initialisation of the models 
  so that the entire system is in balance, i.e., in statistical equilibrium with 
  respect to the fluxes of heat, water, and momentum between the various components 
  of the system. The problem of determining appropriate initial conditions in 
  which fluxes are dynamically and thermodynamically balanced throughout a coupled 
  stiff system, such as the ocean-atmosphere system, is particularly difficult 
  because of the wide range of adjustment times ranging from days to thousands 
  of years. This can lead to a "climate drift", making interpretation 
  of transient climate calculations difficult (see <a href="315.htm#841">Chapter 
  8, Section 8.4.1</a>).<br>
</p>
<p>The initialisation of coupled models is important because it produces the climate 
  base state or "starting point" for climate change experiments. Climate 
  model initialisation continues to be an area of active research and refinement 
  of techniques (see <a href="315.htm">Chapter 8, Section 8.4</a>). Most groups 
  use long integrations of the sub-component models to provide a dynamically and 
  thermodynamically balanced initial state for the coupled model integration. 
  However, there are at least as many different methods used to initialise coupled 
  models as there are modelling groups. See Stouffer and Dixon (1998) for a more 
  complete discussion of the various issues and methods used to initialise coupled 
  models. <br>
</p>
<p>Since the SAR, improvements in developing better initialisation techniques 
  for coupled models have been realised. For instance, starting with observed 
  oceanic conditions has yielded improved simulations with reduced climate drift 
  (Gordon et al., 1999). Earlier attempts with this technique usually resulted 
  in relatively large trends in the surface variables (Meehl and Washington, 1995; 
  Washington and Meehl, 1996). Successfully starting long coupled integrations 
  from observations is important for a number of reasons: it simplifies the initialisation 
  procedure, saves time and effort, and reduces the overhead for starting new 
  coupled model integrations.<br>
</p>
<p>Such progress is important, but again further work is needed. We simply do 
  not fully understand the causes of climate drift in coupled models (see <a href="315.htm#842">Chapter 
  8, Section 8.4.2</a>).</p>
