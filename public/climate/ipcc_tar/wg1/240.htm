<h3>6.8.3 Indirect Radiative Forcing by Other Species</h3>
<h4><a name="6831"></a>6.8.3.1 Carbonaceous aerosols</h4>
<p>In this section, carbonaceous aerosols refer to the mixture (internal or external) 
  of OC and BC aerosols. Carbonaceous aerosols (and in particular biomass burning 
  aerosols) are efficient cloud condensation nuclei (see <a href="160.htm">Chapter 
  5</a> and e.g., Novakov and Penner, 1993; Novakov and Corrigan, 1996). There 
  have been few GCM studies estimating the indirect forcing from carbonaceous 
  aerosols. Penner et al. (1996) reported a range of forcing from -2.5 to -4.5 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup> (not included in <a href="238.htm#tab66">Table 6.6</a>), which 
  is probably an overestimate because of neglect of other aerosol types such as 
  dust and sea salt and underestimated natural emissions of organic aerosols. 
  In a new set of simulations using an updated model accounting for dust and sea 
  salt aerosols, Chuang et al. (2000b) obtained a forcing of -1.51 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  for the first indirect effect from carbonaceous aerosols (-0.52 and -1.16 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup> for fossil fuel and biomass burning aerosols, respectively). 
  This estimate includes the effect of black carbon absorption in cloud droplets. 
  Lohmann et al. (2000) predicted a radiative impact for the combined effect (i.e., 
  first and second effects) of -1.3 and -0.9 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for externally and 
  internally mixed carbonaceous aerosols, respectively. These estimates do not 
  include the effects of secondary organic aerosols, nor the effects of absorption 
  of solar radiation by black carbon within the cloud.</p>
<p>Kaufman and Nakajima (1993) used AVHRR data to analyse bright warm clouds over 
  Brazil during the biomass burning season. They found a decrease in the cloud 
  reflectance when the smoke optical thickness increased. Kaufman and Fraser (1997) 
  used a similar approach to observe thinner and less reflective clouds. They 
  showed that smoke from biomass burning aerosols reduced the cloud droplet size 
  and increased the cloud reflectance for smoke optical depth up to 0.8. They 
  estimated the indirect radiative forcing by smoke to be -2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> over this region 
  for the three months when biomass burning takes place, which would suggest a 
  much smaller global average. However, using a combination of satellite observations 
  and a global chemistry model, Remer et al. (1999) estimated that 50% of the 
  cumulative biomass burning aerosol indirect forcing occurs for smoke optical 
  depth smaller than 0.1, that is well away from the source regions.</p>
<h4><a name="6832"></a>6.8.3.2 Combination of sulphate and carbonaceous aerosols</h4>
<p>Lohmann et al. (2000) found that the radiative impact of sulphate and carbonaceous 
  aerosols considered simultaneously (-1.5 and -1.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for the externally and 
  internally mixed assumptions, respectively) is comparable to the sum of the 
  radiative impacts calculated separately (see <a href="238.htm#tab66">Table 6.6</a>). 
  Chuang et al. (2000b) reached a similar conclusion in their experiments where 
  they considered only the first indirect effect, with a total radiative forcing 
  of -1.85 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. It is noteworthy, however, that in these two studies, the 
  predicted radiative forcings for sulphate aerosols are on the low side. This 
  indicates that it is not wise to add the radiative forcings due to sulphate 
  and carbonaceous aerosols obtained separately from two different models. In 
  fact, most of the GCM studies of the indirect aerosol effect used sulphate as 
  a surrogate for the total anthropogenic fraction of the aerosol (e.g., Boucher 
  and Lohmann, 1995; Feichter et al., 1997; Lohmann and Feichter, 1997). In this 
  case the computed forcings incorporate the effects of other aerosol types which 
  have a similar spatial distribution to sulphate aerosols, such as nitrate aerosols 
  or carbonaceous aerosols from fossil fuel combustion. It will not include, however, 
  the effects of biomass burning aerosols which have a different spatial distribution 
  from sulphate aerosols.</p>
<p>Another issue is the potential for light-absorbing aerosols to increase in-cloud 
  absorption of solar radiation - and correspondingly decrease the cloud 
  albedo - when incorporated inside cloud droplets. Twohy et al. (1989) concluded 
  from measurements off the coast of California and from simple radiative calculations 
  that the observed levels of soot would not lead to a significant impact on the 
  cloud albedo. Chylek et al. (1996a) estimated an upper bound for increased absorption 
  of solar radiation of 1 to 3 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (global and annual average) for 
  a black carbon concentration of 0.5 mgm-3. Considering the modelled atmospheric 
  concentrations of soot (<a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a> and <a href="233.htm">Sections 
  6.7.3</a> and <a href="235.htm">6.7.5</a>) and the fact that only a fraction 
  of the soot is incorporated in the cloud droplets, the effect is probably smaller 
  by one to two orders of magnitude. Heintzenberg and Wendisch (1996) showed that 
  the decrease in radiative forcing due to a decrease in soot concentrations with 
  increasing distances from the pollution sources could be compensated by a concurrent 
  increase in the fraction of soot which is incorporated in the cloud droplets. 
  Only one GCM study to date has considered the in-cloud absorption of soot. Chuang 
  et al. (2000b) estimated a radiative forcing for in-cloud BC of +0.07 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  for the soot concentrations predicted by their model and using an effective 
  medium approximation. More studies are needed to confirm these results.</p>
