<p><a name="fig132"></a>The specific climate scenario needs of the impacts community 
  vary, depending on the geographic region considered, the type of impact, and 
  the purpose of the study. For example, distinctions can be made between scenario 
  needs for research in climate scenario development and in the methods of conducting 
  impact assessment (e.g., Woo, 1992; Mearns et al., 1997) and scenario needs 
  for direct application in policy relevant impact and integrated assessments 
  (e.g., Carter et al., 1996a; Smith et al., 1996; Hulme and Jenkins, 1998).</p>
<p>The types of climate variables needed for quantitative impacts studies vary 
  widely (e.g., White, 1985). However, six "cardinal" variables can 
  be identified as the most commonly requested: maximum and minimum temperature, 
  precipitation, incident solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed. 
  Nevertheless, this list is far from exhaustive. Other climate or climate-related 
  variables of importance may include CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, sea-ice extent, mean 
  sea level pressure, sea level, and storm surge frequencies. A central issue 
  regarding any climate variable of importance for impact assessment is determining 
  at what spatial and temporal scales the variable in question can sensibly be 
  provided, in comparison to the scales most desired by the impacts community. 
  From an impacts perspective, it is usually desirable to have a fair amount of 
  regional detail of future climate and to have a sense of how climate variability 
  (from short to long time-scales) may change. But the need for this sort of detail 
  is very much a function of the scale and purpose of the particular impact assessment. 
  Moreover, the availability of the output from climate models and the advisability 
  of using climate model results at particular scales, from the point of view 
  of the climate modellers, ultimately determines what scales can and should be 
  used.</p>
<p>Scenarios should also provide adequate quantitative measures of uncertainty. 
  The sources of uncertainty are many, including the trajectory of greenhouse 
  gas emissions in the future, their conversion into atmospheric concentrations, 
  the range of responses of various climate models to a given radiative forcing 
  and the method of constructing high resolution information from global climate 
  model outputs (Pittock, 1995; see <a href="#fig132">Figure 13.2</a>). For many 
  purposes, simply defining a single climate future is insufficient and unsatisfactory. 
  Multiple climate scenarios that address at least one, or preferably several 
  sources of uncertainty allow these uncertainties to be quantified and explicitly 
  accounted for in impact assessments. Moreover, a further important requirement 
  for impact assessments is to ensure consistency is achieved among various scenario 
  components, such as between climate change, sea level rise and the concentration 
  of actual (as opposed to equivalent) CO<sub>2</sub> implied by a particular emissions scenario. 
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, climate scenarios that are developed for impacts applications 
  usually require that some estimate of climate change be combined with baseline 
  observational climate data, and the demand for more complete and sophisticated 
  observational data sets of climate has grown in recent years. The important 
  considerations for the baseline include the time period adopted as well as the 
  spatial and temporal resolution of the baseline data. </p>
<p>Much of this chapter is devoted to assessing how and how successfully these 
  needs and requirements are currently met.</p>
