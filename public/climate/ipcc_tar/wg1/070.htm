<h3><a name="233"></a>2.3.3 Was there a "Little Ice Age" and a "Medieval 
  Warm <br>
  Period"? </h3>
<p>The terms "Little Ice Age" and "Medieval Warm Period" have 
  been used to describe two past climate epochs in Europe and neighbouring regions 
  during roughly the 17th to 19th and 11th to 14th centuries, respectively. The 
  timing, however, of these cold and warm periods has recently been demonstrated 
  to vary geographically over the globe in a considerable way (Bradley and Jones, 
  1993; Hughes and Diaz, 1994; Crowley and Lowery, 2000). Evidence from mountain 
  glaciers does suggest increased glaciation in a number of widely spread regions 
  outside Europe prior to the 20th century, including Alaska, New Zealand and 
  Patagonia (Grove and Switsur, 1994). However, the timing of maximum glacial 
  advances in these regions differs considerably, suggesting that they may represent 
  largely independent regional climate changes, not a globally-synchronous increased 
  glaciation (see Bradley, 1999). Thus current evidence does not support globally 
  synchronous periods of anomalous cold or warmth over this timeframe, and the 
  conventional terms of "Little Ice Age" and "Medieval Warm Period" 
  appear to have limited utility in describing trends in hemispheric or global 
  mean temperature changes in past centuries. With the more widespread proxy data 
  and multi-proxy reconstructions of temperature change now available, the spatial 
  and temporal character of these putative climate epochs can be reassessed. </p>
<p>Mann et al. (1998) and Jones et al. (1998) support the idea that the 15th to 
  19th centuries were the coldest of the millennium over the Northern Hemisphere 
  overall. However, viewed hemispherically, the "Little Ice Age" can 
  only be considered as a modest cooling of the Northern Hemisphere during this 
  period of less than 1&deg;C relative to late 20th century levels (Bradley and Jones, 
  1993; Jones et al., 1998; Mann et al., 1998; 1999; Crowley and Lowery, 2000). 
  Cold conditions appear, however, to have been considerably more pronounced in 
  particular regions. Such regional variability can be understood in part as reflecting 
  accompanying changes in atmospheric circulation. The "Little Ice Age" 
  appears to have been most clearly expressed in the North Atlantic region as 
  altered patterns of atmospheric circulation (O'Brien et al., 1995). Unusually 
  cold, dry winters in central Europe (e.g., 1 to 2&deg;C below normal during 
  the late 17th century) were very likely to have been associated with more frequent 
  flows of continental air from the north-east (Wanner et al., 1995; Pfister, 
  1999). Such conditions are consistent (Luterbacher et al., 1999) with the negative 
  or enhanced easterly wind phase of the NAO (<a href="056.htm#2223">Sections 
  2.2.2.3</a> and <a href="086.htm#265">2.6.5</a>), which implies both warm and 
  cold anomalies over different regions in the North Atlantic sector. Such strong 
  influences on European temperature demonstrate the difficulty in extrapolating 
  the sparse early information about European climate change to the hemispheric, 
  let alone global, scale. While past changes in the NAO have likely had an influence 
  in eastern North America, changes in the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon (see also 
  <a href="083.htm#26">Section 2.6</a>), are likely to have had a particularly 
  significant influence on regional temperature patterns over North America.</p>
<p>The hemispherically averaged coldness of the 17th century largely reflected 
  cold conditions in Eurasia, while cold hemispheric conditions in the 19th century 
  were more associated with cold conditions in North America (Jones et al., 1998; 
  Mann et al., 2000b). So, while the coldest decades of the 19th century appear 
  to have been approximately 0.6 to 0.7&deg;C colder than the latter decades of 
  the 20th century in the hemispheric mean (Mann et al., 1998), the coldest decades 
  for the North American continent were closer to 1.5&deg;C colder (Mann et al., 
  2000b). In addition, the timing of peak coldness was often specific to particular 
  seasons. In Switzerland, for example, the first particularly cold winters appear 
  to have been in the 1560s, with cold springs beginning around 1568, and with 
  1573 the first unusually cold summer (Pfister, 1995). </p>
<p>The evidence for temperature changes in past centuries in the Southern Hemisphere 
  is quite sparse. What evidence is available at the hemispheric scale for summer 
  (Jones et al., 1998) and annual mean conditions (Mann et al., 2000b) suggests 
  markedly different behaviour from the Northern Hemisphere. The only obvious 
  similarity is the unprecedented warmth of the late 20th century. Speleothem 
  evidence (isotopic evidence from calcite deposition in stalagmites and stalactites) 
  from South Africa indicates anomalously cold conditions only prior to the 19th 
  century, while speleothem (records derived from analysing stalagmites and stalagtites) 
  and glacier evidence from the Southern Alps of New Zealand suggests cold conditions 
  during the mid-17th and mid-19th centuries (Salinger, 1995). Dendroclimatic 
  evidence from nearby Tasmania (Cook et al., 2000) shows no evidence of unusual 
  coldness at these times. Differences in the seasons most represented by this 
  proxy information prevent a more direct comparison.</p>
<p>As with the "Little Ice Age", the posited "Medieval Warm Period" 
  appears to have been less distinct, more moderate in amplitude, and somewhat 
  different in timing at the hemispheric scale than is typically inferred for 
  the conventionally-defined European epoch. The Northern Hemisphere mean temperature 
  estimates of Jones et al. (1998), Mann et al. (1999), and Crowley and Lowery 
  (2000) show temperatures from the 11th to 14th centuries to be about 0.2&deg;C 
  warmer than those from the 15th to 19th centuries, but rather below mid-20th 
  century temperatures. The long-term hemispheric trend is best described as a 
  modest and irregular cooling from AD 1000 to around 1850 to 1900, followed by 
  an abrupt 20th century warming. Regional evidence is, however, quite variable. 
  Crowley and Lowery (2000) show that western Greenland exhibited anomalous warmth 
  locally only around AD 1000 (and to a lesser extent, around AD 1400), with quite 
  cold conditions during the latter part of the 11th century, while Scandinavian 
  summer temperatures appeared relatively warm only during the 11th and early 
  12th centuries. Crowley and Lowery (2000) find no evidence for warmth in the 
  tropics. Regional evidence for medieval warmth elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere 
  is so variable that eastern, yet not western, China appears to have been warm 
  by 20th century standards from the 9th to 13th centuries. The 12th and 14th 
  centuries appear to have been mainly cold in China (Wang et al., 1998a,b; Wang 
  and Gong, 2000). The restricted evidence from the Southern Hemisphere, e.g., 
  the Tasmanian tree-ring temperature reconstruction of Cook et al. (1999), shows 
  no evidence for a distinct Medieval Warm Period.</p>
<p>Medieval warmth appears, in large part, to have been restricted to areas in 
  and neighbouring the North Atlantic. This may implicate the role of ocean circulation-related 
  climate variability. The Bermuda rise sediment record of Keigwin (1996) suggests 
  warm medieval conditions and cold 17th to 19th century conditions in the Sargasso 
  Sea of the tropical North Atlantic. A sediment record just south of Newfoundland 
  (Keigwin and Pickart, 1999), in contrast, indicates cold medieval and warm 16th 
  to 19th century upper ocean temperatures. Keigwin and Pickart (1999) suggest 
  that these temperature contrasts were associated with changes in ocean currents 
  in the North Atlantic. They argue that the "Little Ice Age" and "Medieval 
  Warm Period" in the Atlantic region may in large measure reflect century-scale 
  changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (see <a href="083.htm#26">Section 
  2.6</a>). Such regional changes in oceanic and atmospheric processes, which 
  are also relevant to the natural variability of the climate on millennial and 
  longer time-scales (see <a href="073.htm#242">Section 2.4.2</a>), are greatly 
  diminished or absent in their influence on hemispheric or global mean temperatures.</p>
