<h2>10.2 Deriving Regional Information: Principles, Objectives and Assumptions 
</h2>
<p>For some applications, the regional information provided by AOGCMs might suffice 
  (<a href="#1021">Section 10.2.1</a>), while in other cases regionalisation techniques 
  are needed in order to enhance the regional information provided by coupled 
  AOGCMs. The "added value" expected of a regionalisation technique 
  essentially depends on the specific problem of interest. Examples in which regionalisation 
  tools can enhance the AOGCM information include the simulation of the spatial 
  structure of temperature and precipitation in areas of complex topography and 
  land-use distribution, the description of regional and local atmospheric circulations 
  (e.g., narrow jet cores, mesoscale convective systems, sea-breeze type circulations, 
  tropical storms) and the representation of processes at high frequency temporal 
  scales (e.g., precipitation frequency and intensity distributions, surface wind 
  variability, monsoon front onset and transition times).</p>
<p>The basic principles behind the regionalisation methods identified here are 
  discussed in <a href="379.htm">Section 10.2.2</a>, high resolution and variable 
  resolution AGCM experiments; <a href="380.htm">Section 10.2.3</a>, RCMs; and 
  <a href="380.htm#1024">Section 10.2.4</a>, empirical/statistical and statistical/dynamical 
  models. The general philosophy behind regionalisation techniques is to use input 
  data from AOGCMs to produce more detailed regional information. By design, many 
  of these techniques are not intended to strongly modify the planetary scale 
  circulations produced by the forcing AOGCM. This ensures consistency with the 
  AOGCM simulation and facilitates the interpretation of the additional detail 
  as due to the increase in resolution. However, high and variable resolution 
  AGCMs, as well as RCMs with sufficiently large domains, can yield significant 
  modification of the large-scale circulations, often leading to an improved simulation 
  of them. This would tend to increase confidence in the simulations, but the 
  implications of inconsistencies with the AOGCM forcing fields would need to 
  be considered carefully in the interpretation of the climate change information.</p>
<p>Note that RCMs and statistical models are often referred to as "downscaling" 
  tools of AOGCM information. The concept of "downscaling" implies that 
  the regional climate is conditioned but not completely determined by the larger 
  scale state. In fact, regional states associated with similar larger scale states 
  may vary substantially (e.g., Starr, 1942; Roebber and Bosart, 1998).</p>
<h3><a name="1021"></a>10.2.1 Coupled AOGCMs</h3>
<p>The majority of climate change impact studies have made use of climate change 
  information provided by transient runs with coupled AOGCMs without any further 
  regionalisation processing. The primary reason for this is the ready availability 
  of this information, which is global in nature and is routinely stored by major 
  laboratories. Data can easily be drawn from the full range of currently available 
  AOGCM experiments of the various modelling centres for any region of the world 
  and uncertainty due to inter-model (or inter-run) differences can thus be evaluated 
  (e.g., Hulme and Brown, 1998). In addition, data can be obtained for a large 
  range of variables down to short (sub-daily) time-scales.</p>
<p>From the theoretical viewpoint, the main advantage of obtaining regional climate 
  information directly from AOGCMs is the knowledge that internal physical consistency 
  is maintained. The feedback resulting from climate change in a particular region 
  on planetary scale climate and the climate of other regions is allowed for through 
  physical and dynamical processes in the model. This may be an important consideration 
  when the simulation of regional climate or climate change is compared across 
  regions.</p>
<p>The limitations of AOGCM regional information are, however, well known. By 
  definition, coupled AOGCMs cannot provide direct information at scales smaller 
  than their resolution (order of several hundred kilometres), neither can AOGCMs 
  capture the detailed effects of forcings acting at sub-grid scales (unless parametrized). 
  Biases in the climate simulation at the AOGCM resolution can thus be introduced 
  by the absence of sub-grid scale variations in forcing. As an example, a narrow 
  (sub-grid scale) mountain range can be responsible for rain shadow effects at 
  the broader scale. Many important aspects of the climate of a region (e.g., 
  climatic means in areas of complex topography or extreme weather systems such 
  as tropical cyclones) can only be directly simulated at much finer resolution 
  than that of current AOGCMs. Analysis relevant to these aspects is undertaken 
  with AOGCM output, but various qualifications need to be considered in the interpretation 
  of the results. Past analyses have indicated that even at their smallest resolvable 
  scales, which still fall under our definition of regional, AOGCMs have substantial 
  problems in reproducing present day climate characteristics. The minimum skilful 
  scale of a model is of several grid lengths, since these are necessary to describe 
  the smallest wavelengths in the model and since numerical truncation errors 
  are most severe for the smallest resolved spatial scales. Furthermore, non-linear 
  interactions are poorly represented for those scales closest to the truncation 
  of a model because of the damping by dissipation terms and because only the 
  contribution of larger scale (and not smaller scale) eddies is accounted for 
  (e.g., von Storch, 1995). </p>
<p>Advantages and disadvantages of using AOGCM information in impact studies can 
  weigh-up differently depending on the region and variables of interest. For 
  example, in instances for which sub-grid scale variation is weak (e.g., for 
  mean sea level pressure) the practical advantages of using direct AOGCM data 
  may predominate (see also <a href="474.htm">Chapter 13</a>). However, even if 
  resolution factors limit the feasibility of using regional information from 
  coupled AOGCMs for impact work, AOGCMs are the starting point of any regionalisation 
  technique presently used. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that AOGCMs 
  show good performance in simulating circulation and climatic features affecting 
  regional climates, such as jet streams and storm tracks. Indeed, most indications 
  are that, in this regard, the AOGCM performance is generally improving, because 
  of both increased resolution and improvements in the representation of physical 
  processes (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>).</p>
