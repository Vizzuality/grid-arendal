<h3><a name="122"></a>1.2.2 Natural Variability of Climate </h3>
<p><i>Internally and externally induced climate variability</i><br>
  Climate variations, both in the mean state and in other statistics such as, 
  for example, the occurrence of extreme events, may result from radiative forcing, 
  but also from internal interactions between components of the climate system. 
  A distinction can therefore be made between externally and internally induced 
  natural climate variability and change.</p>
<p>When variations in the external forcing occur, the response time of the various 
  components of the climate system is very different. With regard to the atmosphere, 
  the response time of the troposphere is relatively short, from days to weeks, 
  whereas the stratosphere comes into equilibrium on a time-scale of typically 
  a few months. Due to their large heat capacity, the oceans have a much longer 
  response time, typically decades but up to centuries or millennia. The response 
  time of the strongly coupled surface-troposphere system is therefore slow compared 
  with that of the stratosphere, and is mainly determined by the oceans. The biosphere 
  may respond fast, e.g. to droughts, but also very slowly to imposed changes. 
  Therefore the system may respond to variations in external forcing on a wide 
  range of space- and time-scales. The impact of solar variations on the climate 
  provides an example of such externally induced climate variations.</p>
<p>But even without changes in external forcing, the climate may vary naturally, 
  because, in a system of components with very different response times and non-linear 
  interactions, the components are never in equilibrium and are constantly varying. 
  An example of such internal climate variation is the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern 
  Oscillation (ENSO), resulting from the interaction between atmosphere and ocean 
  in the tropical Pacific.<br>
  <i><br>
  Feedbacks and non-linearities</i><br>
  The response of the climate to the internal variability of the climate system 
  and to external forcings is further complicated by feedbacks and non-linear 
  responses of the components. A process is called a feedback when the result 
  of the process affects its origin thereby intensifying (positive feedback) or 
  reducing (negative feedback) the original effect. An important example of a 
  positive feedback is the water vapour feedback in which the amount of water 
  vapour in the atmosphere increases as the Earth warms. This increase in turn 
  may amplify the warming because water vapour is a strong greenhouse gas. A strong 
  and very basic negative feedback is radiative damping: an increase in temperature 
  strongly increases the amount of emitted infrared radiation. This limits and 
  controls the original temperature increase.</p>
<p>A distinction is made between physical feedbacks involving physical climate 
  processes, and biogeochemical feedbacks often involving coupled biological, 
  geological and chemical processes. An example of a physical feedback is the 
  complicated interaction between clouds and the radiative balance. <a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a> provides an overview and assessment of the present knowledge of such feedbacks. 
  An important example of a biogeochemical feedback is the interaction between 
  the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and the carbon uptake by the land 
  surface and the oceans. Understanding this feedback is essential for an understanding 
  of the carbon cycle. This is discussed and assessed in detail in <a href="095.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>.</p>
<p>Many processes and interactions in the climate system are non-linear. That 
  means that there is no simple proportional relation between cause and effect. 
  A complex, non-linear system may display what is technically called chaotic 
  behaviour. This means that the behaviour of the system is critically dependent 
  on very small changes of the initial conditions. This does not imply, however, 
  that the behaviour of non-linear chaotic systems is entirely unpredictable, 
  contrary to what is meant by "chaotic" in colloquial language. It 
  has, however, consequences for the nature of its variability and the predictability 
  of its variations. The daily weather is a good example. The evolution of weather 
  systems responsible for the daily weather is governed by such non-linear chaotic 
  dynamics. This does not preclude successful weather prediction, but its predictability 
  is limited to a period of at most two weeks. Similarly, although the climate 
  system is highly non-linear, the quasi-linear response of many models to present 
  and predicted levels of external radiative forcing suggests that the large-scale 
  aspects of human-induced climate change may be predictable, although as discussed 
  in <a href="045.htm#132">Section 1.3.2</a> below, unpredictable behaviour of 
  non-linear systems can never be ruled out. The predictability of the climate 
  system is discussed in <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>.</p>
<p><i>Global and hemispheric variability</i><br>
  Climate varies naturally on all time-scales. During the last million years or 
  so, glacial periods and interglacials have alternated as a result of variations 
  in the Earth's orbital parameters. Based on Antarctic ice cores, more detailed 
  information is available now about the four full glacial cycles during the last 
  500,000 years. In recent years it was discovered that during the last glacial 
  period large and very rapid temperature variations took place over large parts 
  of the globe, in particular in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. 
  These abrupt events saw temperature changes of many degrees within a human lifetime. 
  In contrast, the last 10,000 years appear to have been relatively more stable, 
  though locally quite large changes have occurred. </p>
<p>Recent analyses suggest that the Northern Hemisphere climate of the past 1,000 
  years was characterised by an irregular but steady cooling, followed by a strong 
  warming during the 20th century. Temperatures were relatively warm during the 
  11th to 13th centuries and relatively cool during the 16th to 19th centuries. 
  These periods coincide with what are traditionally known as the medieval Climate 
  Optimum and the Little Ice Age, although these anomalies appear to have been 
  most distinct only in and around the North Atlantic region. Based on these analyses, 
  the warmth of the late 20th century appears to have been unprecedented during 
  the millennium. A comprehensive review and assessment of observed global and 
  hemispheric variability may be found in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
<p>The scarce data from the Southern Hemisphere suggest temperature changes in 
  past centuries markedly different from those in the Northern Hemisphere, the 
  only obvious similarity being the strong warming during the 20th century.</p>
<p><i>Regional patterns of climate variability</i><br>
  Regional or local climate is generally much more variable than climate on a 
  hemispheric or global scale because regional or local variations in one region 
  are compensated for by opposite variations elsewhere. Indeed a closer inspection 
  of the spatial structure of climate variability, in particular on seasonal and 
  longer time-scales, shows that it occurs predominantly in preferred large-scale 
  and geographically anchored spatial patterns. Such patterns result from interactions 
  between the atmospheric circulation and the land and ocean surfaces. Though 
  geographically anchored, their amplitude can change in time as, for example, 
  the heat exchange with the underlying ocean changes.</p>
<p>A well-known example is the quasi-periodically varying ENSO phenomenon, caused 
  by atmosphere-ocean interaction in the tropical Pacific. The resulting El Ni&ntilde;o 
  and La Ni&ntilde;a events have a worldwide impact on weather and climate.</p>
<p>Another example is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which has a strong 
  influence on the climate of Europe and part of Asia. This pattern consists of 
  opposing variations of barometric pressure near Iceland and near the Azores. 
  On average, a westerly current, between the Icelandic low pressure area and 
  the Azores high-pressure area, carries cyclones with their associated frontal 
  systems towards Europe. However the pressure difference between Iceland and 
  the Azores fluctuates on time-scales of days to decades, and can be reversed 
  at times. The variability of NAO has considerable influence on the regional 
  climate variability in Europe, in particular in wintertime. <a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a> discusses the internal processes involved in NAO variability.</p>
<p>Similarly, although data are scarcer, leading modes of variability have been 
  identified over the Southern Hemisphere. Examples are a North-South dipole structure 
  over the Southern Pacific, whose variability is strongly related to ENSO variability, 
  and the Antarctic Oscillation, a zonal pressure fluctuation between middle and 
  high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. A detailed account of regional climate 
  variability may be found in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
