<h3>9.3.6 Changes of Extreme Events </h3>
<p>In this section, possible future changes in extreme weather and climate phenomena 
  or events (discussed in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>) will be assessed from 
  global models. Regional information derived from global models concerning extremes 
  will be discussed in <a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>. </p>
<p>Although the global models have improved over time (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>), they still have limitations that affect the simulation of extreme events 
  in terms of spatial resolution, simulation errors, and parametrizations that 
  must represent processes that cannot yet be included explicitly in the models, 
  particularly dealing with clouds and precipitation (Meehl et al., 2000d). Yet 
  we have confidence in many of the qualitative aspects of the model simulations 
  since they are able to reproduce reasonably well many of the features of the 
  observed climate system not only in terms of means but also of variability associated 
  with extremes (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>). Simulations of 20th century 
  climate have shown that including known climate forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases, 
  aerosols, solar) leads to improved simulations of the climate conditions we 
  have already observed. Ensembles of climate change experiments are now being 
  performed to enable us to better quantify changes of extremes.</p>

<p><a name="fig929"></a>Models described in the IPCC First Assessment Report (Mitchell 
  et al., 1990) showed that a warmer mean temperature increases the probability 
  of extreme warm days and decreases the probability of extreme cold days. This 
  result has appeared consistently in a number of more recent different climate 
  model configurations (Dai et al., 2001; Yonetani and Gordon, 2001). There is 
  also a decrease in diurnal temperature range (DTR) since the night-time temperature 
  minima warm faster than the daytime maxima in many locations (e.g., Dai et al., 
  2001). Although there is some regional variation as noted in <a href="373.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>, some of these changes in DTR have also been seen over a number of areas 
  of the world in observations (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>). In general, 
  the pattern of change in return values for 20-year extreme temperature events 
  from an equilibrium simulation for doubled CO<sub>2</sub> with a global atmospheric 
  model coupled to a non-dynamic slab ocean shows moderate increases over oceans 
  and larger increases over land masses (Zwiers and Kharin, 1998; <a href="#fig929">Figure 
  9.29</a>). This result from a slab ocean configuration without ocean currents 
  is illustrative and could vary from model to model, though it is similar to 
  results from the fully coupled version in a subsequent study (Kharin and Zwiers, 
  2000).</p>
<p>The greatest increase in the 20-year return values of daily maximum temperature 
  (<a href="#fig929">Figure 9.29</a>, top) is found in central and southeast North 
  America, central and south-east Asia and tropical Africa, where there is a decrease 
  in soil moisture content. Large extreme temperature increases are also seen 
  over the dry surface of North Africa. In contrast, the west coast of North America 
  is affected by increased precipitation resulting in moister soil and more moderate 
  increases in extreme temperature. There are small areas of decrease in the Labrador 
  Sea and Southern Ocean that are associated with changes in ocean temperature. 
  The changes in the return values of daily minimum temperature (<a href="#fig929">Figure 
  9.29</a>, bottom) are larger than those of daily maximum temperature over land 
  areas and high latitude oceans where snow and ice retreat. Somewhat larger changes 
  are found over land masses and the Arctic while smaller increases in extreme 
  minimum temperatures occur at the margins of the polar oceans. Thus, there is 
  some asymmetry between the change in the extremes of minimum and maximum temperature 
  (with a bigger increase for minima than maxima). This has to do with the change 
  in the nature of the contact between atmosphere and the surface (e.g., minima 
  increase sharply where ice and snow cover have retreated exposing either ocean 
  or land, maxima increase more where the land surface has dried). Consequently 
  there is a seasonal dependence related to changes in underlying surface conditions, 
  which indroduces uncertainties in some regions in some models (<a href="373.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>). </p>
<p>Simulations suggest that both the mean and standard deviation of temperature 
  are likely to change with a changed climate, and the relative contribution of 
  the mean and standard deviation changes depends on how much each moment changes. 
  Increased temperature variance adds to the probability of extreme high temperature 
  events over and above what could be expected simply from increases in the mean 
  alone. The increased variance of daily temperature in summer in northern mid-continental 
  areas noted above has also been seen in other global models (Gregory and Mitchell, 
  1995). However, as noted in <a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>, such changes can 
  vary from region to region and model to model (e.g., Buishand and Beersma (1996), 
  who showed some small decreases over an area of Europe). The change in the mean 
  is usually larger than the change in variance for most climate change simulations. 
  Climate models have also projected decreased variability of daily temperature 
  in winter over mid-continental Europe (Gregory and Mitchell, 1995). Such a decrease 
  is partly related to a reduction of cold extremes, which are primarily associated 
  with the increased mean of the daily minimum temperature. The detrimental effect 
  of extreme summer heat is likely to be further exacerbated by increased atmospheric 
  moisture. One model scenario shows an increase of about 5&deg;C in July mean 
  "heat index" (a measure which includes both the effects of temperature 
  and moisture, leading to changes in the heat index which are larger than changes 
  in temperature alone; it measures effects on human comfort; see further discussion 
  in <a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>) over the southeastern USA by the year 2050 
  (Delworth et al., 2000). Changes in the heating and cooling degree days are 
  another likely extreme temperature-related effect of future greenhouse warming. 
  For example, analysis of these measures shows a decrease in heating degree days 
  for Canada and an increase in cooling degree days in the southwest USA in model 
  simulations of future climate with increased greenhouse gases (Zwiers and Kharin, 
  1998; Kharin and Zwiers, 2000), though this can be considered a general feature 
  associated with an increase in temperature.</p>
