<h4>14.2.2.4 Organised variability</h4>
<p>An overriding challenge to modelling and to the IPCC is prediction. This challenge 
  is particularly acute when predictive capability is sought for a system that 
  is chaotic, that has significant non-linearities, and that is inherently stiff 
  (i.e., widely varying time constants). And within prognostic investigations 
  of such a complex system, the issue of predicting extreme events presents a 
  particularly vexing yet important problem. However, there appear to be coherent 
  modes of behaviour that not only support a sense of optimism in attacking the 
  prediction problem, but also these modes may offer measurable prediction targets 
  that can be used as benchmarks for evaluating our understanding of the climate 
  system. In addition, predictions of these modes represent valuable contributions 
  in themselves.<br>
</p>
<p>Evaluating the prognostic skill of a model and understanding the characteristics 
  of this skill are clearly important objectives. In the case of weather prediction, 
  one can estimate the range of predictability by evaluating the change of the 
  system from groups of initial states that are close to each other. The differences 
  in these time-evolving states give a measure of the predictive utility of the 
  model. In addition, one has the near-term reality of the evolving weather as 
  a constant source of performance metrics. For the climate issue, the question 
  of predictability is wrapped up with understanding the physics behind the low-frequency 
  variability of climate and distinguishing the signal of climate change (see 
  <a href="346.htm#9221">Chapter 9, Section 9.2.2.1</a>). In other words, there 
  are the paired challenges of capturing (predicting) "natural" variability 
  of climate as well as the emerging anthropogenically forced climate signal. 
  This dual challenge is distinctively climatic in nature, and whereas the longer-term 
  character of climate projections is unavoidable and problematic, the intra-seasonal 
  to inter-decadal modes of climate variability (e.g., ENSO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
  (PDO), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) - see also <a href="303.htm#box72">Chapter 
  7, Box 7.2</a>) offer opportunities to test prognostic climate skill. Here, 
  some predictive skill for the climate system appears to exist on longer time-scales. 
  One example is the ocean-atmosphere phenomenon of ENSO. This skill has been 
  advanced and more clearly demonstrated since the SAR, and this progress and 
  demonstration are important (see <a href="298.htm">Chapter 7, Section 7.6</a>; 
  <a href="330.htm">Chapter 8, Section 8.7</a> and <a href="359.htm">Chapter 9, 
  Section 9.3.5</a>). Such demonstrations and the insights gained in developing 
  and making prognostic statements on climate modes frame an important area for 
  further work.<br>
</p>
<p>This opportunity is well summarised in <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a> (in 
  particular, <a href="330.htm">Section 8.7</a>), "The atmosphere-ocean coupled 
  system shows various modes of variability that range widely from intra-seasonal 
  to inter-decadal time-scales (see <a href="048.htm">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="260.htm">7</a>). 
  Since the SAR, considerable progress has been achieved in characterising the 
  decadal to inter-decadal variability of the ocean-atmosphere system. Successful 
  evaluation of models over a wide range of phenomena increases our confidence."

<h3><a name="1423"></a>14.2.3 Key Sub-systems and Phenomena in the Physical-Climate 
  System</h3>
<p>Central to the climate system are the coupled dynamics of the atmosphere-ocean-terrestrial 
  system, the physical processes associated with the energy and water cycles and 
  the associated biological and chemical processes controlling the biogeochemical 
  cycles, particularly carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, iron, and silicon. 
  The atmosphere plays a unique role in the climate system since on a zeroth order 
  basis it sets the radiative forcing. Specific sub-systems that are important 
  and yet still poorly understood are clouds and sea ice; the thermohaline ocean 
  circulation is a fundamentally important phenomenon that needs to be known better, 
  and underlying these sub-systems and phenomena are the still ill-understood 
  non-linear processes of advection (large-scale) and convection (small-scale) 
  of dynamical and thermodynamical oceanic and atmospheric quantities. These sub-systems, 
  phenomena, and processes are important and merit increased attention to improve 
  prognostic capabilities generally.</p>
