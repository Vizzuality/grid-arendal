<h2>14.3 The Human System</h2>
<h3><a name="1431"></a>14.3.1 Overview</h3>
<p>Human processes are critically linked to the climate system as contributing 
  causes of global change, as determinants of impacts, and through responses. 
  Representing these linkages poses perhaps the greatest challenge to modelling 
  the total Earth system. But understanding them is essential to understanding 
  the behaviour of the whole system and to providing useful advice to inform policy 
  and response. Significant progress has been made, but formidable challenges 
  remain. <br>
</p>
<p>Human activities have altered the Earth system, and many such influences are 
  accelerating with population growth and technological development. The use of 
  fossil fuels and chemical fertilisers are major influences, as is the human 
  transformation of much of the Earth's surface in the past 300 years.<br>
</p>
<p>Land-use change illustrates the potential complexity of linkages between human 
  activity and major non-human components of the Earth system. The terrestrial 
  biosphere is fundamentally modified by land clearing for agriculture, industrialisation, 
  urbanisation, and by forest and rangeland management practices. These changes 
  affect the atmosphere through an altered energy balance over the more intensively 
  managed parts of the land surface, as well as through changed fluxes of water 
  vapour, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and other trace gases between soils, vegetation, and the atmosphere. 
  Changed land use also greatly alters the fluxes of carbon, nutrients, and inorganic 
  sediments into river systems, and consequently into oceanic coastal zones.<br>
</p>
<p>The response of the total Earth system to these changes in anthropogenic forcing 
  is currently not known. Sensitivity studies with altered land cover distributions 
  in general circulation models have shown that drastic changes, such as total 
  deforestation of all tropical or boreal forests, may lead to feedbacks in atmospheric 
  circulation and a changed climate that would not support the original vegetation 
  (e.g., Claussen, 1996). Regional climate simulations, on the other hand, have 
  shown that at the continental scale, important teleconnections may exist through 
  which more modest tropical forest clearing may cause a change in climate in 
  undisturbed areas. Coupling the global to the local is a key challenge; regional 
  studies may prove to be uniquely valuable.<br>
</p>
<p>Human land-use change will continue and probably accelerate due to increasing 
  demands for food and fibre, changes in forest and water management practices, 
  and possibly large-scale projects to sequester carbon in forests or to produce 
  biomass fuels. In addition, anthropogenic changes in material and energy fluxes, 
  resulting from such activities as fossil fuel combustion and chemical fertiliser 
  use, are expected to increase in the coming decades. Predictions of changes 
  in the carbon and nitrogen cycles are sensitive to estimates of human activity 
  and predictions of the impacts of these global changes must take into account 
  human vulnerability, adaptation, and response. Predicting the future response 
  of the Earth system to changes in climate and in parallel to changes in land 
  use and land cover will require projections of trends in the human contributions 
  to these global changes; this sort of modelling presents difficult challenges 
  because of the multiple factors operating at local, regional, continental, and 
  global levels to influence local land-use decisions.<br>
</p>
<p>In sum, the human element probably represents the most important aspect both 
  of the causes and effects of climate change and environmental impacts. Any policy 
  intervention will have human activities as its immediate target. </p>
