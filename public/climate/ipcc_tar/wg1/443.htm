<h2>12.1 Introduction </h2>
<h3><a name="1211"></a>12.1.1 The Meaning of Detection and Attribution</h3>
<p>The response to anthropogenic changes in climate forcing occurs against a backdrop 
  of natural internal and externally forced climate variability that can occur 
  on similar temporal and spatial scales. Internal climate variability, by which 
  we mean climate variability not forced by external agents, occurs on all time-scales 
  from weeks to centuries and millennia. Slow climate components, such as the 
  ocean, have particularly important roles on decadal and century time-scales 
  because they integrate high-frequency weather variability (Hasselmann, 1976) 
  and interact with faster components. Thus the climate is capable of producing 
  long time-scale internal variations of considerable magnitude without any external 
  influences. Externally forced climate variations may be due to changes in natural 
  forcing factors, such as solar radiation or volcanic aerosols, or to changes 
  in anthropogenic forcing factors, such as increasing concentrations of greenhouse 
  gases or sulphate aerosols. </p>
<p><i>Definitions</i><br>
  The presence of this natural climate variability means that the detection and 
  attribution of anthropogenic climate change is a statistical "signal-in-noise" 
  problem. Detection is the process of demonstrating that an observed change is 
  significantly different (in a statistical sense) than can be explained by natural 
  internal variability. However, the detection of a change in climate does not 
  necessarily imply that its causes are understood. As noted in the SAR, the unequivocal 
  attribution of climate change to anthropogenic causes (i.e., the isolation of 
  cause and effect) would require controlled experimentation with the climate 
  system in which the hypothesised agents of change are systematically varied 
  in order to determine the climate's sensitivity to these agents. Such an 
  approach to attribution is clearly not possible. Thus, from a practical perspective, 
  attribution of observed climate change to a given combination of human activity 
  and natural influences requires another approach. This involves statistical 
  analysis and the careful assessment of multiple lines of evidence to demonstrate, 
  within a pre-specified margin of error, that the observed changes are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>unlikely to be due entirely to internal variability;</li>
  <li>consistent with the estimated responses to the given combination of anthropogenic 
    and natural forcing; and </li>
  <li>not consistent with alternative, physically plausible explanations of recent 
    climate change that exclude important elements of the given combination of 
    forcings.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Limitations</i><br>
  It is impossible, even in principle, to distinguish formally between all conceivable 
  explanations with a finite amount of data. Nevertheless, studies have now been 
  performed that include all the main natural and anthropogenic forcing agents 
  that are generally accepted (on physical grounds) to have had a substantial 
  impact on near-surface temperature changes over the 20th century. Any statement 
  that a model simulation is consistent with observed changes can only apply to 
  a subset of model-simulated variables, such as large-scale near-surface temperature 
  trends: no numerical model will ever be perfect in every respect. To attribute 
  all or part of recent climate change to human activity, therefore, we need to 
  demonstrate that alternative explanations, such as pure internal variability 
  or purely naturally forced climate change, are unlikely to account for a set 
  of observed changes that can be accounted for by human influence. Detection 
  (ruling out that observed changes are only an instance of internal variability) 
  is thus one component of the more complex and demanding process of attribution. 
  In addition to this general usage of the term detection (that some climate change 
  has taken place), we shall also discuss the detection of the influence of individual 
  forcings (see <a href="456.htm">Section 12.4</a>). </p>
<p><i>Detection and estimation</i><br>
  The basic elements of this approach to detection and attribution were recognised 
  in the SAR. However, detection and attribution studies have advanced beyond 
  addressing the simple question "have we detected a human influence on climate?" 
  to such questions as "how large is the anthropogenic change?" and 
  "is the magnitude of the response to greenhouse gas forcing as estimated 
  in the observed record consistent with the response simulated by climate models?" 
  The task of detection and attribution can thus be rephrased as an estimation 
  problem, with the quantities to be estimated being the factor(s) by which we 
  have to scale the model-simulated response(s) to external forcing to be consistent 
  with the observed change. The estimation approach uses essentially the same 
  tools as earlier studies that considered the problem as one of hypothesis testing, 
  but is potentially more informative in that it allows us to quantify, with associated 
  estimates of uncertainty, how much different factors have contributed to recent 
  observed climate changes. This interpretation only makes sense, however, if 
  it can be assumed that important sources of model error, such as missing or 
  incorrectly represented atmospheric feedbacks, affect primarily the amplitude 
  and not the structure of the response to external forcing. The majority of relevant 
  studies suggest that this is the case for the relatively small-amplitude changes 
  observed to date, but the possibility of model errors changing both the amplitude 
  and structure of the response remains an important caveat. Sampling error in 
  model-derived signals that originates from the model's own internal variability 
  also becomes an issue if detection and attribution is considered as an estimation 
  problem - some investigations have begun to allow for this, and one study 
  has estimated the contribution to uncertainty from observational sampling and 
  instrumental error. The robustness of detection and attribution findings obtained 
  with different climate models has been assessed. </p>
<p><i>Extensions</i><br>
  It is important to stress that the attribution process is inherently open-ended, 
  since we have no way of predicting what alternative explanations for observed 
  climate change may be proposed, and be accepted as plausible, in the future. 
  This problem is not unique to the climate change issue, but applies to any problem 
  of establishing cause and effect given a limited sample of observations. The 
  possibility of a confounding explanation can never be ruled out completely, 
  but as successive alternatives are tested and found to be inadequate, it can 
  be seen to become progressively more unlikely. There is growing interest in 
  the use of Bayesian methods (Dempster, 1998; Hasselmann, 1998; Leroy, 1998; 
  Tol and de Vos, 1998; Barnett et al., 1999; Levine and Berliner, 1999; Berliner 
  et al., 2000). These provide a means of formalising the process of incorporating 
  additional information and evaluating a range of alternative explanations in 
  detection and attribution studies. Existing studies can be rephrased in a Bayesian 
  formalism without any change in their conclusions, as demonstrated by Leroy 
  (1998). However, a number of statisticians (e.g., Berliner et al., 2000) argue 
  that a more explicitly Bayesian approach would allow greater flexibility and 
  rigour in the treatment of different sources of uncertainty.</p>
