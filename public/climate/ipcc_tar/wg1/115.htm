<h3>3.6.2 Evaluation of Terrestrial Models </h3>
<p>Evaluation of terrestrial carbon cycle models requires different types of data 
  to test processes operating on a range of time-scales from hours to centuries 
  (see <a href="099.htm">Section 3.2.2</a>), including short-term environmental 
  responses of CO<sub>2</sub> and water fluxes between vegetation canopies and 
  the atmosphere (e.g., Cienciala et al., 1998), responses of ecosystem carbon 
  balance to interannual climate variability (e.g. Kindermann et al., 1996; Heimann 
  et al., 1997; G&eacute;rard et al., 1999; Knorr, 2000; Prentice et al., 2000), 
  and longer-term consequences of historical land-use change (McGuire et al., 
  2001). Differences and uncertainties in model behaviour have been evaluated 
  through model intercomparison (Cramer et al., 1999, 2001) and sensitivity analyses 
  (Knorr, 2000; Knorr and Heimann, 2001a).</p>
<h4><a name="3621"></a>3.6.2.1 Natural carbon cycling on land</h4>
<p>Terrestrial model evaluation has traditionally been carried out as comparisons 
  with in situ field observations of ecosystem variables (e.g., Raich et al., 
  1991; Foley, 1994; Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996). The largest data sets of relevant 
  field measurements are for NPP and soil carbon content. Other "target" 
  variables include soil moisture, nitrogen mineralisation rate, and the amounts 
  of carbon and nitrogen in different compartments of the ecosystem. Such comparisons 
  have generally shown reasonable agreement between observed and modelled geographic 
  patterns of these variables, but they do not test the time-dependent response 
  of models to environmental variability.</p>
<p>Time-dependent data sets for in situ comparisons are now becoming available, 
  thanks to eddy-covariance measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes (<a href="099.htm#3221">Section 
  3.2.2.1</a>; <a href="098.htm#box31">Box 3.1</a>). Daily and seasonal cycles 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> and water fluxes provide a test of the coupling between the 
  carbon and hydrological cycles as simulated by terrestrial models (Cienciala 
  et al., 1998). Flux measurements are now being carried out on a multi-annual 
  basis at an increasing number of stations, although global coverage remains 
  uneven, with the greatest concentration in Europe and North America and few 
  measurements from the tropics (see <a href="098.htm#box31">Box 3.1</a>). Field 
  campaigns have started to retrieve flux data from more remote regions (e.g., 
  Schulze et al., 1999). The Large-scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia, 
  LBA, will yield more comprehensive data on the carbon, water and energy exchanges 
  of tropical terrestrial ecosystems and will allow a more rigorous evaluation 
  of the performance of models in the tropics than has been possible up until 
  now (e.g., Tian et al., 1998). As current models show conflicting responses 
  of global NPP to climate (Cramer et al., 1999), systematic comparisons with 
  seasonal and interannual flux measurements are a priority to reduce uncertainties 
  in terrestrial carbon modelling.</p>
<p>Terrestrial models have also been evaluated at a global scale by comparing 
  simulated ecosystem water balance with river runoff (e.g., Neilson and Marks, 
  1994; Foley et al., 1996; Kucharik et al., 2000), and simulated seasonal leaf 
  area with satellite observations of "greenness", often based on the 
  normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Field et al., 1995b; de Fries 
  et al., 1995). NDVI data can be translated into estimates of the plant-absorbed 
  fraction of incoming photo-synthetically active radiation (FPAR) (Asrar et al, 
  1992), which is related to leaf area index (LAI). The first terrestrial model 
  intercomparison showed differences among model simulations of LAI and its seasonality 
  (Bondeau et al., 1999). More recently, it has been shown that constraining a 
  terrestrial model with remotely sensed spatial patterns of FPAR can lead to 
  a reduction of uncertainty in NPP simulations by about one third (Knorr and 
  Heimann, 2001b). Agreement with patterns of remotely sensed FPAR has thus become 
  a standard benchmark for terrestrial models (Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996; Kucharik 
  et al., 2000) and attention has been focused on improving the simulation of 
  LAI and its seasonal variations. </p>
<p>A more direct test of the simulated net exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> between 
  the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere is provided by comparison with 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> measurements at remote monitoring sites. The comparison 
  requires the use of an atmospheric transport model to simulate CO<sub>2</sub> 
  as a passive tracer (Kaminski et al., 1996). The seasonal cycle of atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> shows a strong latitudinal pattern in amplitude and phase, and 
  is dominated by the terrestrial biosphere (Heimann et al., 1998). The ability 
  to simulate this seasonal cycle thus constitutes a benchmark for terrestrial 
  models' response to climate (Denning et al., 1996; Hunt et al., 1996; Heimann 
  et al., 1998; Nemry et al., 1999). Generally, the observed seasonal cycles of 
  CO<sub>2</sub> in northern and tropical latitudes can be well simulated, with 
  terrestrial models using NDVI data as input (Knorr and Heimann, 1995), or by 
  fully prognostic models, including DGVMs (Prentice et al., 2000). </p>
<p>Major features of interannual variability of the CO<sub>2</sub> increase are 
  also simulated by terrestrial models (Kindermann et al., 1996; Heimann et al., 
  1997; G&eacute;rard et al., 1999; Ito and Oikawa, 2000; Knorr, 2000; Prentice 
  et al., 2000). This finding supports the hypothesis (<a href="111.htm">Section 
  3.5.2</a>) that terrestrial effects are important in determining the interannual 
  variability of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. During typical El Ni&ntilde;o events, 
  terrestrial model results consistently show strongly reduced CO<sub>2</sub> 
  uptake or CO<sub>2</sub> release by the land. This result has been obtained 
  with a range of models, even when the models differ substantially in the relative 
  sensitivitivities of NPP and heterotrophic respiration to temperature (Heimann 
  et al., 1997; Knorr, 2000). The low CO<sub>2</sub> growth rate during the early 
  1990s has been simulated by some terrestrial models (Prentice et al., 2000; 
  Knorr, 2000).</p>
<p>At the longest time-scales of interest, spanning the industrial period, models 
  of the natural terrestrial carbon cycle show a pronounced response to rising 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels as a result of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation, 
  generally larger than the NPP response to the climate change over this period 
  (Kicklighter et al., 1999). According to CCMLP results, the CO<sub>2</sub> increase 
  maintains a lead of NPP over Rh and an increase of the amplitude of the seasonal 
  CO<sub>2</sub> cycle (McGuire et al., 2001), consistent with long-term observations 
  (Keeling et al., 1996a), which indicate an increase in amplitude of about 20% 
  since accurate atmospheric measurements began. However, the magnitude of this 
  effect was greatly over- or under estimated by some models, reflecting unresolved 
  differences in the parametrization of the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation response.</p>
