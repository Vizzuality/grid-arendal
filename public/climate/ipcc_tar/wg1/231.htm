<h3>6.6.4 Stratospheric Water Vapour</h3>
<p>The oxidation of CH<sub>4</sub> produces water vapour that can contribute significantly 
  to the levels of H<sub>2</sub>O in the stratosphere. Water vapour is also directly emitted 
  by aircraft in the lower stratosphere. Lelieveld and Crutzen (1992), Lelieveld 
  et al. (1993, 1998), Hauglustaine et al. (1994) and Fuglestvedt et al. (1996) 
  have estimated a contribution of stratospheric water vapour of 2 to 5% of the 
  total CH<sub>4</sub> forcing. Oltmans and Hofmann (1995) have reported an increase in lower 
  stratospheric H<sub>2</sub>O (18 to 20 km) measured at Boulder of 0.8% per year for the 
  period 1981 to 1994. Measurements of stratospheric H<sub>2</sub>O from the HALOE instrument 
  on board the UARS satellite also show an increase in stratospheric H<sub>2</sub>O between 
  30 and 60 km of 40 to 100 ppbv/year for the period 1992 to 1997 (Evans et al., 
  1998; Nedoluha et al., 1998). A similar trend has also been reported by Randel 
  et al. (1999) based on HALOE data for the period 1993 to 1997. In this study, 
  a time variation and a flattening of the trend has been determined after 1996. 
  This stratospheric H<sub>2</sub>O increase is well above that expected from the rising 
  CH<sub>4</sub> levels in the atmosphere. Based on these observed stratospheric H<sub>2</sub>O trends, 
  Forster and Shine (1999) have estimated a radiative forcing of 0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> since 
  1980. Note that, just as for stratospheric O<sub>3</sub>, there exists considerable uncertainty 
  concerning the trend near the tropopause region globally. It should also be 
  noted that if the changes in water vapour were a result of CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation, the 
  changes in H<sub>2</sub>O would be a forcing. However, if they result from changes in tropical 
  tropopause temperature change or in dynamics, then they should be viewed as 
  a feedback (as defined in <a href="216.htm">Section 6.2</a>). Additional measurements 
  and analyses are clearly needed to explain the observed trends.</p>
<h2><a name="67"></a>6.7 The Direct Radiative Forcing of Tropospheric Aerosols</h2>
<p>Anthropogenic aerosols scatter and absorb short-wave and long-wave radiation, 
  thereby perturbing the energy budget of the Earth/atmosphere system and exerting 
  a direct radiative forcing. This section concentrates on estimates of the global 
  mean direct effect of anthropogenic tropospheric aerosols and is necessarily 
  dependent upon global models. Field campaigns which provide essential input 
  parameters for the models, and satellite observational studies of the direct 
  effect of tropospheric aerosols, which provide useful validation data for the 
  models, are considered in detail in <a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="671"></a>6.7.1 Summary of the IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report and 
  Areas of Development</h3>
<p>The SAR considered three anthropogenic aerosol species; sulphate, biomass burning 
  aerosols, and fossil fuel black carbon (or soot). The SAR suggested a radiative 
  forcing of -0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with a factor of two uncertainty for sulphate 
  aerosols, -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with a factor of three uncertainty for biomass 
  burning, and +0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with a factor of three uncertainty for fossil 
  fuel black carbon aerosols. The level of scientific understanding (referred 
  to as a confidence level in the SAR, see <a href="251.htm">Section 6.13</a>) 
  was classified as "low" for sulphate aerosol and "very low" 
  for both fossil fuel black carbon and biomass burning aerosols. Since the SAR, 
  there have been advances in both modelling and observational studies of the 
  direct effect of tropospheric aerosols (see reviews by Shine and Forster (1999) 
  and Haywood and Boucher (2000)). Global chemical transport modelling studies 
  encompass a greater number of aerosol species and continue to improve the representation 
  of the physical and chemical processes (see <a href="127.htm">Chapters 4</a> 
  and <a href="160.htm">5</a>). Global models are more numerous and include more 
  accurate radiative transfer codes, more sophisticated treatments of the effects 
  of relative humidity for hygroscopic aerosols, better treatment of clouds, and 
  better spatial and temporal resolution than some earlier studies. The present 
  day direct radiative forcing due to aircraft emissions of sulphate and black 
  carbon aerosol have been calculated to be insignificant (IPCC, 1999) and are 
  not considered further. Spatial patterns of the calculated radiative forcings 
  are not discussed in detail here but are presented in <a href="253.htm">Section 
  6.14</a>.</p>
