<p><a name="fig123"></a>The global mean change in radiative forcing (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>) since the pre-industrial period may give an indication of the relative 
  importance of the different external factors influencing climate over the last 
  century. The temporal and spatial variation of the forcing from different sources 
  may help to identify the effects of individual factors that have contributed 
  to recent climate change. </p>
<p><i>The need for climate models</i><br>
  To detect the response to anthropogenic or natural climate forcing in observations, 
  we require estimates of the expected space-time pattern of the response. The 
  influences of natural and anthropogenic forcing on the observed climate can 
  be separated only if the spatial and temporal variation of each component is 
  known. These patterns cannot be determined from the observed instrumental record 
  because variations due to different external forcings are superimposed on each 
  other and on internal climate variations. Hence climate models are usually used 
  to estimate the contribution from each factor. The models range from simpler 
  energy balance models to the most complex coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation 
  models that simulate the spatial and temporal variations of many climatic parameters 
  (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>). </p>
<p><i>The models used</i><br>
  Energy balance models (EBMs) simulate the effect of radiative climate forcing 
  on surface temperature. Climate sensitivity is included as an adjustable parameter. 
  These models are computationally inexpensive and produce noise-free estimates 
  of the climate signal. However, EBMs cannot represent dynamical components of 
  the climate signal, generally cannot simulate variables other than surface temperature, 
  and may omit some of the important feedback processes that are accounted for 
  in more complex models. Most detection and attribution approaches therefore 
  apply signals estimated from coupled Atmosphere Ocean General Circulation Models 
  (AOGCMs) or atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCMs) coupled to mixed-layer 
  ocean models. Forced simulations with such models contain both the climate response 
  to external forcing and superimposed internal climate variability. Estimates 
  of the climate response computed from model output will necessarily contain 
  at least some noise from this source, although this can be reduced by the use 
  of ensemble simulations. Note that different models can produce quite different 
  patterns of response to a given forcing due to differences in the representation 
  of feedbacks arising from changes in cloud (in particular), sea ice and land 
  surface processes.</p>
<p><i>The relationship between patterns of forcing and response</i><br>
  There are several reasons why one should not expect a simple relationship between 
  the patterns of radiative forcing and temperature response. First, strong feedbacks 
  such as those due to water vapour and sea ice tend to reduce the difference 
  in the temperature response due to different forcings. This is illustrated graphically 
  by the response to the simplified aerosol forcing used in early studies. The 
  magnitude of the model response is largest over the Arctic in winter even though 
  the forcing is small, largely due to ice-albedo feedback. The large-scale patterns 
  of change and their temporal variations are similar, but of opposite sign, to 
  that obtained in greenhouse gas experiments (<a href="#fig123">Figure 12.3</a>, 
  see also Mitchell et al., 1995a). Second, atmospheric circulation tends to smooth 
  out temperature gradients and reduce the differences in response patterns. Similarly, 
  the thermal inertia of the climate system tends to reduce the amplitude of short-term 
  fluctuations in forcing. Third, changes in radiative forcing are more effective 
  if they act near the surface, where cooling to space is restricted, than at 
  upper levels, and in high latitudes, where there are stronger positive feedbacks 
  than at low latitudes (Hansen et al., 1997a). </p>
<p>In practice, the response of a given model to different forcing patterns can 
  be quite similar (Hegerl et al., 1997; North and Stevens, 1998; Tett et al., 
  1999). Similar signal patterns (a condition often referred to as "degeneracy") 
  can be difficult to distinguish from one another. Tett et al. (1999) find substantial 
  degeneracy between greenhouse gas, sulphate, volcanic and solar patterns they 
  used in their detection study using HadCM2. On the other hand, the greenhouse 
  gas and aerosol patterns generated by ECHAM3 LSG (Hegerl et al., 2000) are more 
  clearly separable, in part because the patterns are more distinct, and in part 
  because the aerosol response pattern correlates less well with ECHAM3 LSG's 
  patterns of internal variability. The vertical patterns of temperature change 
  due to greenhouse gas and stratospheric ozone forcing are less degenerate than 
  the horizontal patterns.</p>
<p><i>Summary</i><br>
  Different models may give quite different patterns of response for the same 
  forcing, but an individual model may give a surprisingly similar response for 
  different forcings. The first point means that attribution studies may give 
  different results when using signals generated from different models. The second 
  point means that it may be more difficult to distinguish between the response 
  to different factors than one might expect, given the differences in radiative 
  forcing.</p>
