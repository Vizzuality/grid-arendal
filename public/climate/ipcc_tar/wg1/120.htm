<h3>3.7.2 Ocean Carbon Model Responses to Scenarios of Change in CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and Climate </h3>
<p>Analogous simulations have been performed with several ocean carbon models 
  (<a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 3.10</a>c,d). To compute the impact of increasing 
  CO<sub>2</sub> alone (no climate change), OCMIP models were forced to follow 
  the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration derived from the IS92a scenario 
  as in the DGVM experiment (<a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 3.10</a>a,b) (Orr 
  and Dutay, 1999). All models agreed in projecting that the annual ocean-atmosphere 
  flux of CO<sub>2</sub> continues to become larger, reaching -6.7 to -4.5 PgC/yr 
  by 2100 (<a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 3.10c</a>). Since surface conditions 
  (temperature, wind speed, alkalinity) were prescribed, the range in model estimates 
  stems only from different representations of physical transport processes. <br>
  Several atmosphere-ocean models were used to project the effect of climate change 
  (Maier-Reimer et al., 1996; Sarmiento et al., 1998; Matear and Hirst, 1999; 
  Joos et al., 1999b; Bopp et al., 2001). These models include most processes 
  previously discussed, including all processes associated with carbonate chemistry 
  and gas exchange, physical and biological transport of CO<sub>2</sub>, and changes 
  in temperature, salinity, wind speed, and ice cover. They account for simple 
  changes in biological productivity, but not for changes in external nutrient 
  supply, species composition, pH, or Redfield ratios, all of which could be involved 
  in more complex biological feedbacks. Coupled models estimate the impact of 
  climate change as a departure, reported in per cent, from a "control" 
  experiment modelling the effect of increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> alone. 
</p>
<p>In climate change simulations, warming of surface waters and increased stratification 
  of the upper ocean produced an overall positive feedback that reduced the accumulated 
  ocean uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> by 6 to 25% between 1990 and the middle of the 
  21st century, as compared with the CO<sub>2</sub>-only case. In the first part 
  of the simulation, the climate-mediated feedback is mainly due to the temperature 
  effect on CO<sub>2</sub> solubility (Sarmiento and Le Qu&eacute;r&eacute;, 1996; 
  Matear and Hirst, 1999). Towards the mid-century, the impact of circulation 
  changes becomes significant in most models, with the net effect of further reducing 
  ocean CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. To investigate the effect of climate change on 
  the IS92a scenario, the average of the OCMIP CO<sub>2</sub>-only projections 
  (mean of results in <a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 3.10c</a>) was used as a 
  baseline and the reduction in atmosphere-ocean CO<sub>2</sub> flux caused by 
  climate change (in per cent since the beginning of the simulation) was applied 
  to this curve (<a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 3.10d</a>). The range in model 
  results (<a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 3.10d</a>) must be attributed to uncertainties 
  related to climate change feedback, and not to uncertainties in the modelling 
  of physical transport as shown in <a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 3.10c</a>. 
</p>
<p>The range of model estimates of the climate change impact is dependent on the 
  choice of scenario for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and on assumptions concerning 
  marine biology (Joos et al., 1999b). At high CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, 
  marine biology can have a greater impact on atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> than 
  at low concentrations because the buffering capacity of the ocean is reduced 
  (see <a href="104.htm#box33">Box 3.3</a>) (Sarmiento and Le Qu&eacute;r&eacute;, 
  1996). Although the impact of changes in marine biology is highly uncertain 
  and many key processes discussed in <a href="104.htm#3231">Section 3.2.3.1</a> 
  are not included in current models, sensitivity studies can provide approximate 
  upper and lower bounds for the potential impact of marine biology on future 
  ocean CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. A sensitivity study of two extreme scenarios for 
  nutrient supply to marine biology gave a range of 8 to 25% for the reduction 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by mid-century (Sarmiento et al., 1998). This range 
  is comparable to other uncertainties, including those stemming from physical 
  transport (<a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 3.10c</a>). </p>
