<h3><a name="266"></a>2.6.6 The Southern Hemisphere </h3>
<p>Since the SAR there has been more emphasis on analysis of decadal variability 
  over the Southern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere gridded SLP data for the 
  period 1950 to 1994 show two dominant modes in annual average values, similar 
  to those identified by Karoly et al. (1996) using station data. The first mode 
  unambiguously represents the Southern Oscillation and reflects the tendency 
  towards more frequent and intense negative phases over the past several decades. 
  The second mode represents anomalies throughout the mid-latitude regions across 
  the Indian Ocean and western Pacific, which contrast with anomalies elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Trans-Polar Index (TPI) is the only large-scale station pressure-based 
  extra-tropical Southern Hemisphere circulation index in regular use. It is based 
  on the normalised pressure difference between New Zealand and South America 
  and has been recalculated and extended by Jones et al. (1999b). On decadal and 
  longer time-scales the TPI reflects movement in the phase of wave number one 
  around the Southern Hemisphere. Troughing (low pressure) was more frequent in 
  the New Zealand region in the 1920s, and at a maximum in the 1940s. Anticyclonicity 
  was favoured from the late 1950s to 1976, with troughing in the South American 
  sector. Troughing was again apparent in the New Zealand sector in the 1990s 
  (Salinger et al., 1996). </p>
<p>A leading mode of variability in the extra-tropical Southern Hemisphere circulation 
  on interannual to multi-decadal time-scales is a zonally elongated north-south 
  dipole structure over the Pacific, stretching from the sub-tropics to the Antarctic 
  coast (Mo and Higgins, 1998; Kidson, 1999; Kiladis and Mo, 1999). It is strongly 
  related to ENSO variability. The lower-frequency dipole structure contributes 
  to variability in blocking frequency across the far south Pacific (Renwick, 
  1998; Renwick and Revell, 1999).</p>
<p>ENSO variability is also implicated in the modulation of a "High Latitude 
  Mode" (HLM) (Kidson, 1988; Karoly, 1990), especially over the austral summer. 
  The HLM is now also called the "Antarctic Oscillation" (AAO); they 
  appear to be the same phenomenon with the same structure (Thompson and Wallace, 
  2000). The AAO is a zonal pressure fluctuation between mid- and high latitudes 
  of the Southern Hemisphere, centred on 55 to 60&deg;S. It has recently been 
  further studied (Gong and Wang, 1999c; Kidson, 1999; Thompson and Wallace, 2001; 
  <a href="#fig231">Figure 2.31</a>) and shown to extend into the lower 
  stratosphere between the Antarctic and the sub-tropical latitudes of the Southern 
  Hemisphere. The AAO appears to persist all year but may be most active from 
  mid-October to mid-December when it extends into the stratosphere (Thompson 
  and Wallace, 2001). In its high index phase, it consists of low pressure or 
  heights above the Antarctic and the near Southern Ocean with high heights north 
  of about 50oS. Although the data are sparse, there is evidence that, like the 
  NAO, the AAO has tended to move more towards a positive index phase, despite 
  lower pressures being observed over the New Zealand region during the 1990s. 
  This change is also associated with with increasing westerly winds in mid-latitudes. 
  Thompson and Wallace (2001) show that most of Antarctica is rather cold in this 
  phase, except for the Antarctic Peninsula which is warm due to additional advection 
  of relatively warm air from seas to the west. This may explain some of the behaviour 
  of Antarctic temperatures in the last two decades (<a href="057.htm#fig210">Figure 
  2.10</a>; Comiso, 2000). </p>
<p>Other work has identified the likely existence of an Antarctic Circumpolar 
  Wave (ACW) (Jacobs and Mitchell, 1996; White and Peterson, 1996), a multi-annual 
  climate signal in the Southern Ocean, with co-varying and perhaps coupled SST 
  and SLP anomalies that move around the Southern Ocean. Its long-term variability 
  is not yet known. </p>
<h3><a name="267"></a>2.6.7 Summary</h3>
<p>The interannual variability of ENSO has fluctuated substantially over the last 
  century, with notably reduced variability during the period 1920 to 1960, compared 
  with adjacent periods. It remains unclear whether global warming has influenced 
  the shift towards less frequent La Ni&ntilde;a episodes from 1976 to 1998, including 
  the abnormally protracted ENSO 1990 to 1995 event and the exceptionally strong 
  1982/83 and 1997/98 events. Analysis of SST patterns indicates that a global 
  warming pattern may have increased the background temperature in the region 
  most affected by ENSO, but there is some ambiguity in the details of this pattern. 
</p>
<p>Since the SAR, &#145;ENSO-like' features operating on decadal to multi-decadal 
  time-scales have been identified, such as the PDO and IPO. They appear to be 
  part of a continuous spectrum of ENSO variability that has subtly changing SST 
  patterns as time-scales increase and which may have distinctive effects on regional 
  climate around the Pacific basin. For the period since 1900, El Ni&ntilde;o 
  (La Ni&ntilde;a) events are more prevalent during positive (negative) phases 
  of the IPO. </p>
<p>In the Northern Hemisphere, pronounced changes in winter atmospheric and oceanic 
  circulations over the North Pacific in the 1970s (the North Pacific Oscillation) 
  have been paralleled by wintertime circulation changes over the North Atlantic, 
  recorded by the NAO. In the North Pacific, spatially coherent changes have occurred 
  in surface temperature across the North Pacific and western North America, while 
  the enhanced westerly phase of the NAO has caused considerable winter half-year 
  temperature and precipitation changes over a vast area of extra-tropical Eurasia. 
  In the Southern Hemisphere, a feature quite like the NAO, the HLM or the AAO, 
  also appears to have moved into an enhanced westerly phase in middle latitudes.</p>
