<h3>12.1.2 Summary of the First and Second Assessment Reports </h3>
<p>The first IPCC Scientific Assessment in 1990 (IPCC, 1990) concluded that the 
  global mean surface temperature had increased by 0.3 to 0.6&deg;C over the previous 
  100 years and that the magnitude of this warming was broadly consistent with 
  the predictions of climate models forced by increasing concentrations of greenhouse 
  gases. However, it remained to be established that the observed warming (or 
  part of it) could be attributed to the enhanced greenhouse effect. Some of the 
  reasons for this were that there was only limited agreement between model predictions 
  and observations, because climate models were still in the early stages of development; 
  there was inadequate knowledge of natural variability and other possible anthropogenic 
  effects on climate and there was a scarcity of suitable observational data, 
  particularly long, reliable time-series. </p>
<p>By the time of the SAR in 1995, considerable progress had been made in attempts 
  to identify an anthropogenic effect on climate. The first area of significant 
  advance was that climate models were beginning to incorporate the possible climatic 
  effects of human-induced changes in sulphate aerosols and stratospheric ozone. 
  The second area of progress was in better defining the background variability 
  of the climate system through multi-century model experiments that assumed no 
  changes in forcing. These provided important information about the possible 
  characteristics of the internal component of natural climate variability. The 
  third area of progress was in the application of pattern-based methods that 
  attempted to attribute some part of the observed changes in climate to human 
  activities, although these studies were still in their infancy at that time. 
</p>
<p>The SAR judged that the observed trend in global climate over the previous 
  100 years was unlikely to be entirely natural in origin. This led to the following, 
  now well-known, conclusion: "Our ability to quantify the human influence 
  on global climate is currently limited because the expected signal is still 
  emerging from the noise of natural variability, and because there are uncertainties 
  in key factors. Nevertheless, the balance of evidence suggests that there is 
  a discernible human influence on global climate". It also noted that the 
  magnitude of the influence was uncertain.</p>
<h3><a name="1213"></a>12.1.3 Developments since the Second Assessment Report</h3>
<p>In the following sections, we assess research developments since the SAR in 
  areas crucial to the detection of climate change and the attribution of its 
  causes. First, in <a href="445.htm">Section 12.2</a>, we review advances in 
  the different elements that are needed in any detection and attribution study, 
  including observational data, estimates of internal climate variability, natural 
  and anthropogenic climate forcings and their simulated responses, and statistical 
  methods for comparing observed and modelled climate change. We draw heavily 
  on the assessments in earlier chapters of this report, particularly <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2 - Observed Climate Variability and Change</a>, <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6 
  - Radiative Forcing of Climate Change</a>, <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8 - Model 
  Evaluation</a>, and <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9 - Projections of Future Climate 
  Change</a>. </p>
<p>In <a href="454.htm">Section 12.3</a>, a qualitative assessment is made of 
  observed and modelled climate change, identifying general areas of agreement 
  and difference. This is based on the observed climate changes identified with 
  most confidence in Chapter 2 and the model projections of climate change from 
  <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>. </p>
<p>Next, in <a href="456.htm">Section 12.4</a>, advances obtained with quantitative 
  methods for climate change detection and attribution are assessed. These include 
  results obtained with time-series methods, pattern correlation methods, and 
  optimal fingerprint methods. The interpretation of optimal fingerprinting as 
  an estimation problem, finding the scaling factors required to bring the amplitude 
  of model-simulated changes into agreement with observed changes, is discussed. 
  Some remaining uncertainties are discussed in <a href="466.htm">Section 12.5</a> 
  and the key findings are drawn together in <a href="467.htm">Section 12.6</a>.</p>
