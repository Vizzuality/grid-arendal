<h3>10.2.3 Regional Climate Models (RCMs) </h3>
<p>The nested regional climate modelling technique consists of using initial conditions, 
  time-dependent lateral meteorological conditions and surface boundary conditions 
  to drive high-resolution RCMs. The driving data is derived from GCMs (or analyses 
  of observations) and can include GHG and aerosol forcing. A variation of this 
  technique is to also force the large-scale component of the RCM solution throughout 
  the entire domain (e.g., Kida et al., 1991; Cocke and LaRow, 2000; von Storch 
  et al., 2000)</p>
<p>To date, this technique has been used only in one-way mode, i.e., with no feedback 
  from the RCM simulation to the driving GCM. The basic strategy is, thus, to 
  use the global model to simulate the response of the global circulation to large-scale 
  forcings and the RCM to (a) account for sub-GCM grid scale forcings (e.g., complex 
  topographical features and land cover inhomogeneity) in a physically-based way; 
  and (b) enhance the simulation of atmospheric circulations and climatic variables 
  at fine spatial scales.</p>
<p>The nested regional modelling technique essentially originated from numerical 
  weather prediction, and the use of RCMs for climate application was pioneered 
  by Dickinson et al. (1989) and Giorgi (1990). RCMs are now used in a wide range 
  of climate applications, from palaeoclimate (Hostetler et al., 1994, 2000) to 
  anthropogenic climate change studies (<a href="389.htm">Section 10.5</a>). They 
  can provide high resolution (up to 10 to 20 km or less) and multi-decadal simulations 
  and are capable of describing climate feedback mechanisms acting at the regional 
  scale. A number of widely used limited area modelling systems have been adapted 
  to, or developed for, climate application. More recently, RCMs have begun to 
  couple atmospheric models with other climate process models, such as hydrology, 
  ocean, sea-ice, chemistry/aerosol and land-biosphere models. </p>
<p>Two main theoretical limitations of this technique are the effects of systematic 
  errors in the driving fields provided by global models; and lack of two-way 
  interactions between regional and global climate (with the caveats discussed 
  in <a href="379.htm">Section 10.2.2</a> for variable resolution models). Practically, 
  for a given application, consideration needs to be given to the choice of physics 
  parametrizations, model domain size and resolution, technique for assimilation 
  of large-scale meteorological conditions, and internal variability due to non-linear 
  dynamics not associated with the boundary forcing (e.g., Giorgi and Mearns, 
  1991, 1999; Ji and Vernekar 1997). Depending on the domain size and resolution, 
  RCM simulations can be computationally demanding, which has limited the length 
  of many experiments to date. Finally, GCM fields are not routinely stored at 
  high temporal frequency (6-hourly or higher), as required for RCM boundary conditions, 
  and thus careful co-ordination between global and regional modellers is needed 
  in order to perform RCM experiments.</p>
<h3><a name="1024"></a>10.2.4 Empirical/Statistical and Statistical/Dynamical 
  Downscaling </h3>
<p>Statistical downscaling is based on the view that regional climate may be thought 
  of as being conditioned by two factors: the large-scale climatic state, and 
  regional/local physiographic features (e.g., topography, land-sea distribution 
  and land use; von Storch, 1995, 1999a). From this viewpoint, regional or local 
  climate information is derived by first determining a statistical model which 
  relates large-scale climate variables (or "predictors") to regional 
  and local variables (or "predictands"). Then the predictors from an 
  AOGCM simulation are fed into this statistical model to estimate the corresponding 
  local and regional climate characteristics.</p>
<p>A range of statistical downscaling models, from regressions to neural networks 
  and analogues, has been developed for regions where sufficiently good data sets 
  are available for model calibration. In a particular type of statistical downscaling 
  method, called statistical-dynamical downscaling (see <a href="397.htm">Section 
  10.6.2.3</a>), output of atmospheric mesoscale models is used in statistical 
  relationships. Statistical downscaling techniques have their roots in synoptic 
  climatology (Growetterlagen; e.g., Baur et al., 1944; Lamb, 1972) and numerical 
  weather prediction (Klein and Glahn, 1974), but they are also currently used 
  for a wide range of climate applications, from historical reconstruction (e.g., 
  Appenzeller et al., 1998; Luterbacher et al., 1999), to regional climate change 
  problems (see <a href="395.htm">Section 10.6</a>). A number of review papers 
  have dealt with downscaling concepts, prospects and limitations: von Storch 
  (1995); Hewitson and Crane (1996); Wilby and Wigley (1997); Zorita and von Storch 
  (1997); Gyalistras et al. (1998); Murphy (1999,2000).</p>
<p>One of the primary advantages of these techniques is that they are computationally 
  inexpensive, and thus can easily be applied to output from different GCM experiments. 
  Another advantage is that they can be used to provide local information, which 
  can be most needed in many climate change impact applications. The applications 
  of downscaling techniques vary widely with respect to regions, spatial and temporal 
  scales, type of predictors and predictands, and climate statistics (see <a href="395.htm">Section 
  10.6</a>). In addition, empirical downscaling methods often offer a framework 
  for testing the ability of physical models to simulate the empirically found 
  links between large-scale and small-scale climate (Busuioc et al., 1999; Murphy, 
  1999; Osborn et al., 1999; von Storch et al., 1993; Noguer, 1994).</p>
<p>The major theoretical weakness of statistical downscaling methods is that their 
  basic assumption is not verifiable, i.e., that the statistical relationships 
  developed for present day climate also hold under the different forcing conditions 
  of possible future climates. In addition, data with which to develop relationships 
  may not be readily available in remote regions or regions with complex topography. 
  Another caveat is that these empirically-based techniques cannot account for 
  possible systematic changes in regional forcing conditions or feedback processes. 
  The possibility of tailoring the statistical model to the requested regional 
  or local information is a distinct advantage. However, it has the drawback that 
  a systematic assessment of the uncertainty of this type of technique, as well 
  as a comparison with other techniques, is difficult and may need to be carried 
  out on a case-by-case basis. </p>
