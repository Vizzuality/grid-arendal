<h4>7.2.4.2 Radiative processes in the stratosphere</h4>
<p>The stratosphere lies immediately above the troposphere, with the height of 
  the bounding tropopause varying from about 15 km in the tropics to about 7 km 
  at high latitudes. The mass of the stratosphere represents only about 10 to 
  20% of the total atmospheric mass, but changes in stratospheric climate are 
  important because of their effect on stratospheric chemistry, and because they 
  enter into the climate change detection problem (Randel and Wu, 1999; Shine 
  and Forster, 1999). In addition there is a growing realisation that stratospheric 
  effects can have a detectable and perhaps significant influence on tropospheric 
  climate.</p>
<p> Solar radiative heating of the stratosphere is mainly from absorption of ultraviolet 
  (UV) and visible radiation by ozone, along with contributions due to the near-infrared 
  absorption by carbon dioxide and water vapour. Depletion of the direct and diffuse 
  solar beams arises from scattering by molecules, aerosols, clouds and surface 
  (Lacis and Hansen, 1974).</p>
<p> The long-wave process consists of absorption and emission of infrared radiation, 
  principally by carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, water vapour and 
  halocarbons (CFCs, HFCs, HCFCs, PFCs etc.). The time-scales for the radiative 
  adjustment of stratospheric temperatures is less than about 50 to 100 days.</p>
<p> For CO<sub>2</sub>, part of the main 15 micron band is saturated over quite short vertical 
  distances, so that some of the upwelling radiation reaching the lower stratosphere 
  originates from the cold upper troposphere. When the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is increased, 
  the increase in absorbed radiation is quite small and increased emission leads 
  to a cooling at all heights in the stratosphere. But for gases such as the CFCs, 
  whose absorption bands are generally in the 8 to 13 micron "atmospheric 
  window", much of the upwelling radiation originates from the warm lower 
  troposphere, and a warming of the lower stratosphere results, although there 
  are exceptions (see Pinnock et al., 1995). Methane and nitrous oxide are in 
  between. In the upper stratosphere, increases in all well-mixed gases lead to 
  a cooling as the increased emission becomes greater than the increased absorption. 
  Equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> is the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> used in a model calculation that results 
  in the same radiative forcing of the surface-troposphere system as a mixture 
  of greenhouse gases (see e.g., IPCC, 1996) but does not work well for stratospheric 
  temperature changes (Wang et al., 1991; Shine, 1993; WMO, 1999).</p>
<p> An ozone loss leads to a reduction in the solar heating, while the major long-wave 
  radiative effects from the 9.6 and 14 micron bands (Shine et al., 1995) produce 
  a cooling tendency in the lower stratosphere and a positive radiative change 
  above (Ramaswamy et al., 1996; Forster et al., 1997). Large transient loadings 
  of aerosols in the stratosphere follow volcanic eruptions (IPCC, 1996) which 
  leads to an increase of the heating in the long-wave. For the solar beam, aerosols 
  enhance the planetary albedo while the interactions in the near-infrared spectrum 
  yield a heating which is about one third of the total solar plus long-wave heating 
  (IPCC, 1996; WMO, 1999). In addition, ozone losses can result from heterogeneous 
  chemistry occurring on or within sulphate aerosols, and those changes produce 
  a radiative cooling (Solomon et al., 1996).</p>
<p> The Antarctic ozone hole is a stratospheric phenomenon with a documented impact 
  on temperature and, during the period 1979 to 1994, ozone decreases very likely 
  contributed a negative radiative forcing of the troposphere-surface that offset 
  perhaps as much as one half of the positive radiative forcing attributable to 
  the increases in CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases (Hansen et al., 1997; Shine 
  and Forster, 1999). It appears that most of the observed decreases in upper-tropospheric 
  and lower-stratospheric temperatures were due to ozone decreases rather than 
  increased CO<sub>2</sub> (Ramaswamy et al., 1996; Tett et al., 1996; Bengtsson et al., 
  1999).</p>
<p> The subject of solar effects on climate and weather (see <a href="243.htm#610">Section 
  6.10</a>) has enjoyed a recent resurgence, in part because of observational 
  studies (Labitzke and van Loon, 1997), but more so because of modelling studies 
  that suggest viable mechanisms involving the stratosphere. As solar irradiance 
  changes, proportionally much greater changes are found in the ultraviolet which 
  leads to photochemically induced ozone changes, and the altered UV radiation 
  changes the stratospheric heating rates per amount of ozone present (Haigh, 
  1996; Shindell et al., 1999a). Including the altered ozone concentrations gave 
  an enhanced tropospheric response provided the stratosphere was adequately resolved.</p>
