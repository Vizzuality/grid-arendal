<h2>7.7 Rapid Changes in the Climate System </h2>
<p>Small changes in the climate system can be sufficiently understood by assuming 
  linear relationships between variables. However, many climate processes are 
  non-linear by nature, and conclusions based on linear models and processes may 
  in these cases no longer be valid. Non-linearity is a prerequisite for the existence 
  of thresholds in the climate system: small perturbations or changes in the forcing 
  can trigger large reorganisations if thresholds are passed. The result is that 
  atmospheric and oceanic circulations may change from one regime to another. 
  This could possibly be manifested as rapid climate change.</p>
<p> There is no clear definition of "rapid climate change". In general, 
  this notion is used to describe climate changes that are of significant magnitude 
  (relative to the natural variability) and occur as a shift in the mean or variability 
  from one level to another. In order to distinguish such changes from "extreme 
  events", a certain persistence of the change is required. Among the classical 
  cases are spontaneous transitions from one preferred mode to another or transitions 
  triggered by slowly varying forcing. This occurs in non-linear systems which 
  have multiple equilibria (Lorenz, 1993). Evidence for the possibility of such 
  transitions can be found in palaeoclimatic records (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>, <a href="072.htm">Section 2.4</a>; and Stocker, 2000), in observations 
  of changes in large-scale circulation patterns from the instrumental record 
  (see <a href="303.htm#7651">Section 7.6.5.1</a>), and contemporary observations 
  of regional weather patterns (e.g., Corti et al., 1999).</p>
<p> Here, we briefly summarise non-linear changes that have captured attention 
  in the recent literature and that have been assessed in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Northern Hemispheric atmospheric circulation exhibits different regimes 
    that are associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation. Recent analyses of 
    observations suggest that relatively rapid regime changes are possible (see 
    <a href="280.htm">Section 7.2.6</a>) and that they may have happened frequently 
    in the past (Appenzeller et al., 1998). Several studies suggest that the recent 
    changes may be a response to anthropogenic forcing, but our understanding 
    of the processes generating NAO is not sufficient to have confidence in whether 
    this is the case. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Observed variability of ENSO suggests that a transition to more frequent 
    El Ni&ntilde;o occurred around 1976 (see <a href="303.htm#7651">Section 7.6.5.1</a>). 
    Current understanding of ENSO processes does not yet permit a distinction 
    as to the extent this is a response to anthropogenic forcing versus part of 
    the long-term natural variability of the tropical atmosphere-ocean system, 
    or both (see also <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="083.htm#262">Section 
    2.6.2</a>).</li>
  <li>Results from most climate models suggest that the Atlantic thermohaline 
    circulation slows down in response to global warming; some models simulate 
    a complete shut-down if certain thresholds are passed (see <a href="287.htm">Section 
    7.3.6</a> and <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="357.htm">Section 9.3.4.3</a>). 
    Such a shut-down is in general not abrupt but evolves on a time-scale which 
    is determined by the warming, i.e., a few decades to centuries. Processes 
    for such an evolution are increasingly understood. As model resolution increases 
    and high latitude processes are better represented in these models (sea ice, 
    topography), additional feedbacks influencing the Atlantic THC will be investigated 
    and their relative importance must be explored. This will lead to a better 
    quantification of the overall stability of the THC.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Large polar ice masses, ice shelves or even complete ice sheets may be 
    destabilised by sea level rise (see <a href="293.htm">Section 7.5</a> and 
    <a href="408.htm">Chapter 11</a>, <a href="427.htm">Section 11.3.3</a>), thereby 
    contributing to further sea level rise.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Warming in the high latitudes may lead to significant reductions in sea 
    ice and associated feedbacks may accelerate this development (see <a href="293.htm#box71">Box 
    7.1</a>).</li>
  <li>Large-scale and possibly irreversible changes in the terrestrial biosphere 
    and vegetation cover are thought to have occurred in the past when anthropogenic 
    perturbation was negligible (e.g., the development of the Saharan desert, 
    Claussen et al., 1999). These changes may be interpreted as non-linear changes 
    triggered by slow changes in external forcing and thus cannot be excluded 
    to occur in the future. Knowledge on these phenomena, however, is not advanced 
    yet.</li>
</ul>
<p> Reducing uncertainty in climate projections also requires a better understanding 
  of these non-linear processes which give rise to thresholds that are present 
  in the climate system. Observations, palaeoclimatic data, and models suggest 
  that such thresholds exist and that transitions have occurred in the past. The 
  occurrence of such transitions can clearly not be excluded in a climate that 
  is changing. On the contrary, model simulations indicate that such transitions 
  lie within the range of changes that are projected for the next few centuries 
  if greenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase. A particular concern 
  is the fact that some of these changes may even be irreversible due to the existence 
  of multiple equilibrium states in the climate system.</p>
<p> Comprehensive climate models in conjunction with sustained observational systems, 
  both in situ and remote, are the only tool to decide whether the evolving climate 
  system is approaching such thresholds. Our knowledge about the processes, and 
  feedback mechanisms determining them, must be significantly improved in order 
  to extract early signs of such changes from model simulations and observations.</p>
