<h3>5.3.5 Aerosol Impact on Liquid-Water Content and Cloud Amount</h3>
<p>The indirect effect of aerosols on clouds is determined not only by the instantaneous 
  mean droplet concentration change (i.e., the first indirect or Twomey effect; 
  Twomey, 1977) but is also strongly associated with the development of precipitation 
  and thus the cloud liquid-water path, lifetime of individual clouds and the 
  consequent geographic extent of cloudiness (second indirect effect). These processes 
  are well illustrated by marine stratiform clouds.</p>
<p>The longevity of marine stratiform clouds, a key cloud type for climate forcing 
  in the lower troposphere, is dictated by a delicate balance between a number 
  of source and sink terms for condensed water, including turbulent latent and 
  sensible heat fluxes from the ocean surface, radiative cooling and heating rates, 
  entrainment of dry air from above the cloud top inversion, and the precipitation 
  flux out of the cloud. Unfortunately, changes to cloud extent induced by plausible 
  changes in cloud droplet number concentration due to aerosol modulation can 
  be slight and difficult to characterise (cf., Hignett, 1991). For example, Pincus 
  and Baker (1994) point out that changes in short-wave absorption induced by 
  changes in drop number act primarily to change cloud thickness - and cloud 
  thickness is also strongly modulated by non-radiative processes. Depending on 
  the cloud type, feedbacks involving cloud thickness can substantially reduce 
  or enhance changes in cloud albedo due to change in droplet concentration (Boers 
  and Mitchell 1994; Pincus and Baker, 1994). Feingold et al. (1997) have more 
  recently examined the impact of drizzle modulation by aerosol on cloud optical 
  depth.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, precipitation processes are extremely important to marine cloud 
  fraction, with varying precipitation efficiency leading to varying fractional 
  cloudiness and liquid water content (Albrecht, 1989). The postulated mechanism 
  is as follows. The activation of a larger number of aerosol particles limits 
  the size to which drops can grow for an available cooling rate. Hence, the number 
  of drops which grow large enough to initiate the collision-coalescence process 
  (the dominant precipitation process in warm clouds) is decreased and precipitation 
  rates are attenuated. With precipitation attenuated, a major sink for cloud 
  drops is removed and cloud lifetime is enhanced. Liou and Cheng (1989) first 
  estimated the potential global significance of this process. Further studies 
  with more sophisticated models have supported the significance of the modulation 
  of precipitation by aerosols and led to the consideration of several different 
  processes that contribute to the effects of aerosols on clouds. <br>
</p>
<p>One such process is the modulation of cloud optical depth by precipitation. 
  Pincus and Baker (1994) showed, using a simple mixed-layer model, that the cloud 
  optical depth in marine stratiform clouds was a strong function of the initial 
  aerosol concentration upon which the cloud formed, the dependence being close 
  to exponential. Boers (1995) subsequently demonstrated, through modelling calculations 
  coupled with field observations, that a substantial part of the seasonal cycle 
  in cloud albedo at Cape Grim could be due to the modulation of cloud optical 
  depth by aerosols and their effects on the efficiency of precipitation. </p>
<p>A second important process which may be affected by onset of precipitation 
  is that of decoupling of the cloud layer from the surface. Precipitation may 
  sometimes produce a sub-cloud stable layer that cuts off the moisture flux to 
  the cloud. However, decoupling is not an inevitable consequence of precipitation 
  formation and, under some circumstances, a balance between the moisture flux 
  from the surface and precipitation sinks determine the cloud extent. Pincus 
  et al. (1997) observed no difference between precipitating and non-precipitating 
  stratocumulus with respect to cloud fraction and both Austin et al. (1995) and 
  Stevens et al. (1998) found that observed stratocumulus seemed able to maintain 
  themselves despite a considerable precipitation rate.</p>
<p>While the effect of precipitation modulation on cloud amount is supported by 
  a number of studies, several others have argued that external thermodynamic 
  factors such as sea surface temperature (SST) are the main factors determining 
  the formation and dissipation of marine stratocumulus (cf., Wyant et al., 1997). 
  Such an analysis is also supported by the relationship of satellite-derived 
  aerosol number concentration with cloud droplet number concentration and with 
  liquid-water path. The former shows a positive correlation while the latter 
  shows no particular relationship (Nakajima et al., 2001). Thus, the climatological 
  significance of this aspect of the indirect effect needs a great deal more investigation.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that the impact of anthropogenic aerosols 
  on precipitation modulation will be dependent on both the natural and anthropogenic 
  aerosol size distributions. For example, a number of studies have suggested 
  that both natural (e.g., Feingold et al., 1999a) and anthropogenic (Eagen et 
  al., 1974) giant CCN have a great impact on precipitation and will influence 
  the effect of smaller, anthropogenic CCN on precipitation.</p>
