<h3>7.3.4 Mesoscale Eddies</h3>
<p>Mesoscale eddies in the ocean have a scale of 50 to 100 km, and correspond 
  dynamically to high and low pressure systems in the atmosphere. The role of 
  eddies for climate change arises from their influence on the circulation by 
  (i) transporting and mixing temperature and salinity, (ii) exchanging (usually 
  extracting) potential energy from the mean flow, and (iii) exchanging momentum 
  with the mean flow (in both directions). Eddy processes are of primary importance 
  for the dynamics of intense western boundary currents, through the exchange 
  of momentum and energy via instability and/or rectification processes, and also 
  influence the dynamics of the Southern Ocean. The eddy contribution to the meridional 
  transport of heat and fresh water is small in many regions but cannot be ignored 
  on the global scale. Long lived, propagating eddies such as Agulhas rings determine 
  a major part of the inter-basin exchange between Indian and South Atlantic Oceans. 
  The decaying rings provide a source of warm salty water important for the global 
  thermohaline circulation (de Ruijter et al., 1999), and variations in that exchange 
  may generate THC variations.</p>
<p> Considerable progress has been made in recent years with the parametrization 
  of eddies in climate models of coarse and medium resolution (cf., <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>, <a href="316.htm#tab81">Table 8.1</a>) which do not explicitly represent 
  eddies. New schemes are based on eddy dynamics and the physics of baroclinic 
  instability. Lateral eddy mixing of tracers such as potential temperature and 
  salinity is mainly directed along isopycnals, and has a small effect on the 
  dynamics but is important for water mass properties. The traditional mixing 
  along horizontal surfaces which is still used in several climate models leads 
  to unrealistic upwelling in the western boundary current (Boening et al., 1995) 
  and strongly resolution-dependent simulations of meridional overturning and 
  heat transport (Roberts and Marshall, 1998). Isopycnal mixing is natural in 
  models with an isopycnal vertical co-ordinate, for other models a stable and 
  conservative algorithm for isopycnal rotation of the diffusion tensors is now 
  available (Griffies et al., 1998).</p>
<p> The dynamical effects of baroclinic instability are now frequently parametrized 
  as an additional eddy advection of tracers (Gent et al., 1995). With this parametrization, 
  the northward heat transport in the North Atlantic Ocean is less dependent on 
  resolution, and matches the observational estimates much better. Aspects of 
  the Southern Hemisphere circulation are also improved by this parametrization. 
  Theoretical studies (e.g., Killworth, 1997) suggest somewhat different formulations 
  based on down-gradient mixing of potential vorticity. The strengths of isopycnal 
  mixing and eddy-induced advection are usually described empirically through 
  coefficients which are constant or dependent on grid size. For modelling climate 
  change, it is, however, imperative to relate these coefficients to properties 
  of the mean flow (Visbeck et al., 1997).</p>
<p> The parametrization of exchange of eddy momentum with the mean flow remains 
  a challenge. Some studies suggest a substantial eddy influence on the mean barotropic 
  flow based on the interaction of a statistical eddy field with bottom topography 
  (Eby and Holloway, 1994; Merryfield and Holloway, 1997). However, due to the 
  near-geostrophy of ocean currents, it is possible that these processes are not 
  as critical as the sub-grid scale effects on tracers for the overall quality 
  of ocean model solutions.</p>
<p> In summary, while the effects of ocean eddies for climate change are likely 
  to be moderately small, a quantitative assessment will require coupled simulations 
  with eddy-permitting ocean models. </p>
