<h2>6.9 Stratospheric Aerosols</h2>
<p>IPCC (1992, 1994) and the SAR have dealt with the climatic effects of episodic, 
  explosive volcanic events which result in significant enhancements of aerosol 
  concentrations in the stratosphere. The most dramatic of these in recent times 
  has been the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. The radiative, chemical, dynamical 
  and climatic consequences accompanying the transient duration of sulphuric acid 
  aerosols in the stratosphere have been discussed in previous IPCC assessments. 
  The eruption of Mt. Pinatubo reached a peak forcing of about -3 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  (uncertainty of 20%) in 1991 (Hansen et al., 1998; Stenchikov et al., 1998), 
  and was plausibly the largest volcanic aerosol forcing of this century, perturbing 
  the stratospheric and surface climate significantly (SAR). However, aerosol 
  levels in the stratosphere have now fallen to well below the peak values seen 
  in 1991 to 1993, and are comparable to the very low value seen in about 1979, 
  which was a quiescent time as far as volcanic activity was concerned (WMO, 1999). 
  It is likely that even the heterogeneous chemical effects initiated by aerosols 
  upon the O<sub>3</sub> chemistry and its destruction (Solomon et al., 1996) 
  have diminished. One consequence of the aerosol-induced ozone depletion may 
  have been a prolonged cooling of the lower stratosphere to abnormally low values 
  through the mid-1990s, as estimated from satellite and radiosonde observations 
  (WMO, 1999, <a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a>). Although episodic in nature and 
  transient in duration, volcanic events can exert a significant influence on 
  the time history of the radiative forcing evolution and thereby on the long-term 
  (interannual to decadal scale) temperature record (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>).</p>
<p>As noted in previous IPCC Assessments, there are difficulties in compiling 
  a good quantitative record of the episodic volcanic events (see also Rowntree, 
  1998), in particular the intensity of their forcings prior to the 1960s. Efforts 
  have been made to compile the optical depths of the past volcanoes (SAR; Robock 
  and Free, 1995, 1996; Andronova et al., 1999); however, the estimated global 
  forcings probably have an uncertainty of a factor of two or more. Several major 
  volcanic eruptions occurred between 1880 and 1920, and between 1960 and 1991.</p>
<h2><a name="610"></a>6.10 Land-use Change (Surface Albedo Effect)</h2>
<p>Changes in land surface albedo can result from land-use changes (Henderson-Sellers, 
  1995) and thus be tied to an anthropogenic cause. Hansen et al. (1997b) estimate 
  that a forcing of -0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup> has resulted, about half of which is estimated to 
  have occurred in the Industrial Era. The largest effect is estimated to be at 
  the high latitudes where snow-covered forests that have a lower albedo have 
  been replaced by snow-covered deforested areas. Hansen et al. (1998) point out 
  that the albedo of a cultivated field is affected more by a given snowfall than 
  the albedo of an evergreen forest. They performed a simulation with pre-industrial 
  vegetation replaced by current land-use patterns and found the global mean forcing 
  to be -0.21 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, with the largest contributions coming from deforested areas 
  in Eurasia and North America. In a similar study, Betts (2001) estimates an 
  instantaneous radiative forcing of -0.20 Wm<sup>-2</sup> by surface albedo change 
  due to present day land use relative to natural vegetation. In agreement with 
  Hansen et al. (1997b), the greatest effect is seen in the high latitude agricultural 
  regions. If, as above, half of the land clearance is assumed to have taken place 
  since the industrial revolution, this suggests a forcing of -0.10 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  by land use over this period. In a parallel simulation with the climate free 
  to respond to the change in albedo and other vegetation characteristics, lower 
  temperatures are simulated in the northern mid-latitudes. These are mainly attributed 
  to the increased surface albedo, although increases in cloud cover cause further 
  localised reductions in the net surface short-wave radiation in some regions. 
  However, some areas exhibit higher temperatures in their dry season, consistent 
  with a decrease in evapotranspiration due to reduced access of soil moisture 
  by the shallower roots of the crops compared with forest.</p>
<p>Following Hansen et al. (1997b), Shine and Forster (1999) recommended in their 
  review a value of -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with at least a 0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> uncertainty. We adopt those 
  values here for the best estimate and range, respectively; however, in view 
  of the small number of investigations and uncertainty in historical land cover 
  changes, there is very low confidence in these values at present.</p>
<p>Changes in land use can also exert other kinds of climatic impacts, e.g., changes 
  in roughness length, turbulent fluxes, and soil moisture and heat budgets (see 
  also <a href="260.htm">Chapters 7</a> and <a href="308.htm">8</a>). Further, 
  there are a host of factors that are potentially affected by land-use change 
  and that could have an impact on the atmospheric concentrations of radiatively 
  active trace gases and aerosols. For instance, the dry deposition rates of species 
  could be affected owing to the surface roughness change. Precipitation changes 
  induced by deforestation etc. could affect the wet deposition of species and 
  thereby bring about biogeochemical changes, leading to changes in lifetimes. 
  The impacts due to such changes have not been comprehensively investigated.</p>
