<h3><a name="226"></a>2.2.6 Are the Retreat of Glaciers, Sea Ice, and Snow Cover 
  Consistent with the Surface Temperature Trends?</h3>
<p>A significant relationship has been found between interannual variations (correlation 
  = -0.60) of the Northern Hemisphere snow-cover extent and land-surface air temperature 
  in spring since the 1960s. However, the observed increase in temperature during 
  the winter is not reflected in a reduced snow-cover extent. Reduced ice cover 
  on the Northern Hemisphere lakes and rivers, primarily due to earlier onset 
  in spring of ice-free conditions during the 20th century, is consistent with 
  reduced snow cover extent in that season. Sea-ice retreat in the Arctic spring 
  and summer is also consistent with an increase in spring, and to a lesser extent, 
  summer temperatures in the high northern latitudes. Summer temperature increases 
  have been less than in spring in nearby land areas, but Arctic sea-ice extent 
  and especially thickness have markedly decreased. Nevertheless, there is only 
  a small indication of reduced Arctic sea ice during winter when temperatures 
  have also increased. Antarctic sea-ice extent has not decreased since the late 
  1970s, possibly related to recent indications of little change in Antarctic 
  temperatures over much of the continent in that period . There is now ample 
  evidence to support a major retreat of most mountain glaciers during the last 
  100 years in response to widespread increases in temperature. There has been 
  especially fast glacial recession in the tropics in recent decades, although 
  tropical temperatures in the free atmosphere near glacier levels have increased 
  little since 1980 according to radiosonde and MSU data. </p>
<h3><a name="227"></a>2.2.7 Summary </h3>
<p>Global surface temperatures have increased between 0.4 
  and 0.8&deg;C since the late 19th century, but most of this increase has occurred 
  in two distinct periods, 1910 to 1945 and since 1976. The rate of temperature 
  increase since 1976 has been over 0.15&deg;C/decade. Our confidence in the rate 
  of warming has increased since the SAR due to new analyses including: model 
  simulations using observed SSTs with and without corrections for time-dependent 
  biases, new studies of the effect of urbanisation on global land temperature 
  trends, new evidence for mass ablation of glaciers, continued reductions in 
  snow-cover extent, and a significant reduction in Arctic sea-ice extent in spring 
  and summer, and in thickness. However, there is some disagreement between warming 
  rates in the various land and ocean-based data sets in the 1990s, though all 
  agree on appreciable warming.</p>
<p>New analyses of mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures continue to support 
  a reduction in the diurnal temperature range with minimum temperatures increasing 
  at about twice the rate of maximum temperatures over the second half of the 
  20th century. Seasonally, the greatest warming since 1976 over land has occurred 
  during the Northern Hemisphere winter and spring, but significant warming has 
  also occurred in the Northern Hemisphere summer. Southern Hemisphere warming 
  has also been strongest during the winter over land, but little difference between 
  the seasons is apparent when both land and oceans are considered. The largest 
  rates of warming continue to be found in the mid- and high latitude continental 
  regions of the Northern Hemisphere. </p>
<p>Analyses of overall temperature trends in the low to mid-troposphere and near 
  the surface since 1958 are in good agreement, with a warming of about 0.1&deg;C 
  per decade. Since the beginning of the satellite record (1979), however, low 
  to mid-troposphere temperatures have warmed in both satellite and weather balloon 
  records at a global rate of only 0.04 and 0.03&deg;C/decade respectively. This 
  is about 0.12&deg;C/decade less than the rate of temperature increase near the 
  surface since 1979. About half of this difference in warming rate is very likely 
  to be due to the combination of differences in spatial coverage and the real 
  physical affects of volcanoes and ENSO (Santer et al., 2000), see also <a href="439.htm">Chapter 
  12</a>. The remaining difference remains unexplained, but is likely to be real. 
  In the stratosphere, both satellites and weather balloons continue to show substantial 
  cooling. The faster rate of recession of tropical mountain glaciers in the last 
  twenty years than might have been expected from the MSU and radiosonde records 
  remains unexplained, though some glaciers may still be responding to the warming 
  indicated by radiosondes that occurred around 1976 to 1981.</p>
