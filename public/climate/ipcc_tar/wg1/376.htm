<h3>10.1.1 Summary of SAR </h3>
<p>The analysis of regional climate information in the SAR (<a href="228.htm#66">Section 
  6.6</a> of Kattenberg et al., 1996) consisted of two primary segments. In the 
  first, results were analysed from an intercomparison of AOGCM experiments over 
  seven large (sub-continental) regions of the world. The intercomparison included 
  AOGCMs with and without ocean flux correction and focused on summer and winter 
  precipitation and surface air temperature. Biases in the simulation of present 
  day climate with respect to observations and sensitivities at time of greenhouse 
  gas (GHG) doubling were analysed. A broad inter-model range of regionally averaged 
  biases and sensitivities was found, with marked inter-regional variability. 
  Temperature biases were mostly in the range of &plusmn;5&ordm;C, with several 
  instances of larger biases (even in excess of 10&deg;C). Precipitation biases 
  were mostly in the range of &plusmn;50%, but with a few instances of biases 
  exceeding 100%. The range of sensitivities was lower for both variables.</p>
<p>The second segment of the analysis focused on results from nested RCMs and 
  statistical downscaling experiments. Both these techniques were still at the 
  early stages of their development and application, so that only a limited set 
  of studies was available. The primary conclusions from these studies were that 
  (a) both RCMs and downscaling techniques showed a promising performance in reproducing 
  the regional detail in surface climate characteristics as forced by topography, 
  lake, coastlines and land use distribution; and (b) high resolution surface 
  forcings can modify the surface climate change signal at the sub-AOGCM grid 
  scale. </p>
<p>Overall, the SAR placed low confidence in the simulation of regional climate 
  change produced by available modelling tools, primarily because of three factors: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>errors in the reproduction of present day regional climate characteristics; 
  </li>
  <li>wide range in the simulated regional climatic changes by different models; 
  </li>
  <li>need to more comprehensively use regionalisation techniques to study the 
    sub-AOGCM grid scale structure of the climate change signal. </li>
</ul>
<p> Other points raised in the SAR were the need for better observational data 
  sets for model validation at the regional scale and the need to examine higher 
  order climate statistics. </p>
