<p><a name="fig87"></a>In this and the following two sub-sections we discuss simulations 
  by AGCMs that are provided observed sea surface temperatures and sea-ice distributions 
  as input boundary conditions. AOGCM control runs have not yet been thoroughly 
  examined in studies of surface boundary fluxes or mid-tropospheric and stratospheric 
  quantities.</p>
<p>Satellite observations over the past quarter of a century have provided estimates 
  of top of atmosphere (TOA) flux that are considered reliable. Any discrepancies 
  between models and observations are usually attributed to the inadequate modelling 
  of clouds, since they are difficult to specify and accurately model, and account 
  for most of the variability.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no global estimates of surface flux that do not rely 
  heavily on models. The best model-independent estimates come from the Global 
  Energy Balance Archive (GEBA), a compilation of observations from more than 
  1,000 stations (Gilgen et al., 1998). Compared with GEBA observations, surface 
  solar insolation is overestimated in most AGCMs (Betts et al., 1993; Garratt, 
  1994; Wild et al., 1997, 1998; Garratt et al., 1998). Downwelling long wave 
  radiation, on the other hand, is underestimated (Garratt and Prata, 1996; Wild 
  et al., 1997). The shortwave discrepancy is of more concern: it is more than 
  a factor of two larger than the long-wave discrepancy, and could be due to missing 
  absorption processes in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The observations indicate that about 25% of the incident solar flux at the 
  TOA is absorbed in the atmosphere, but most models underestimate this quantity 
  by 5 to 8% of the of the incident solar flux (Arking, 1996, 1999; Li et al., 
  1997). The extent and the source (or sources) of this discrepancy have been 
  intensely debated over the past five years, with investigations yielding contradictory 
  results on whether the discrepancy is associated with clouds, aerosols, water 
  vapour, or is an artefact of the instrumentation and/or the methods by which 
  sensors are calibrated and deployed.</p>
<p>This discrepancy is important for climate modelling because it affects the 
  partitioning of solar energy between the atmosphere and the surface. If the 
  observations are correct, then improving the models will reduce the energy available 
  for surface evaporation by 10 to 20% with a corresponding reduction in precipitation 
  (Kiehl et al., 1995) and a general weakening of the hydrological cycle. </p>
<h4><a name="85123"></a>8.5.1.2.3 Mid-tropospheric variables</h4>
<p>The SAR concluded that although atmospheric models adequately simulate the 
  three-dimensional temperature distribution and wind patterns, "current 
  models portray the large-scale latitudinal structure and seasonal change of 
  the observed total cloud cover with only fair accuracy". Subsequent studies 
  have confirmed both the good and bad aspects of model simulations. Throughout 
  most of the troposphere, errors in AMIP1 ensemble simulations of temperature 
  and zonal wind are small compared with either inter-model scatter or the observed 
  spatial standard deviation (Gates et al., 1999). (See <a href="333.htm">Section 
  8.8</a> for brief discussion of storm tracks.) On the other hand, discrepancies 
  between models and observations that substantially exceed the observational 
  uncertainty are evident for both clouds (Mokhov and Love, 1995; Weare et al., 
  1995, 1996; Weare, 2000a, 2000b) and upper tropospheric humidity (see <a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>).</p>
<p>Although solutions to these problems have proved elusive, incremental improvements 
  have been noted since publication of the SAR. For total cloudiness, a revised 
  subset of AMIP models exhibits noticeably less inter-model variation and significantly 
  less average r.m.s error (Gates et al., 1999; <a href="#fig87">Figure 8.7</a>), 
  compared with the original versions of the models. Several models adequately 
  simulate seasonal changes in cloud radiative forcing (Cess et al., 1997). Model 
  intercomparisons organised under the Global Energy and Water cycle Experiment 
  (GEWEX) Cloud System Study (Stewart et al., 1998) will provide further information 
  for improving cloud simulation. For tropospheric humidity, improved agreement 
  with observations may result from improved numerical techniques (<a href="335.htm">Section 
  8.9</a>). Furthermore, even though the seasonal mean amounts of clouds and upper 
  tropospheric water vapour are not well simulated in current climate models, 
  variations of these quantities may be more important than absolute amounts for 
  predicting climate changes. For example, Del Genio et al. (1994) noted that, 
  in mid-latitudes, the seasonal cycle of upper tropospheric humidity can be simulated 
  reasonably well by climate models. They argued that this variation provides 
  a surrogate for decadal climate change in mid-latitudes because both are characterised 
  by combined temperature increase and latitudinal temperature-gradient decrease, 
  and thus both have similar effects on storms.</p>
<p>Examination of monsoons in climate models provides another measure of their 
  ability to simulate hydrologic variations. Developments since publication of 
  the SAR have been encouraging. Sperber and Palmer (1996) found that about half 
  the original AMIP models obtained a realistic dependence of monsoon circulation 
  on location and season. A follow-up study reveals that nearly all the revised 
  AMIP models do so (Sperber et al., 1999; see <a href="331.htm">Section 8.7.3</a>).</p>
