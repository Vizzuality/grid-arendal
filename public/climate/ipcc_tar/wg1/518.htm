<h1>Appendix I - Glossary</h1>
<p><b>Editor: A.P.M. Baede</b></p>
<p>A <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">indicates that the following 
  term is also contained in this Glossary.</p>
<p><b>Adjustment time</b><br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Lifetime; see also: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Response 
  time.</p>
<p><b>Aerosols</b><br>
  A collection of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical size between 
  0.01 and 10 &micro;m and residing in the atmosphere for at least several hours. 
  Aerosols may be of either natural or anthropogenic origin. Aerosols may influence 
  climate in two ways: directly through scattering and absorbing radiation, and 
  indirectly through acting as condensation nuclei for cloud formation or modifying 
  the optical properties and lifetime of clouds. See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Indirect 
  aerosol effect.<br>
  The term has also come to be associated, erroneously, with the propellant used 
  in "aerosol sprays".</p>
<p><b>Afforestation</b><br>
  Planting of new forests on lands that historically have not contained forests. 
  For a discussion of the term <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">forest 
  and related terms such as afforestation, <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">reforestation, 
  and <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">deforestation: see the 
  IPCC Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000).</p>
<p><b>Albedo</b><br>
  The fraction of solar radiation reflected by a surface or object, often expressed 
  as a percentage. Snow covered surfaces have a high albedo; the albedo of soils 
  ranges from high to low; vegetation covered surfaces and oceans have a low albedo. 
  The Earth's albedo varies mainly through varying cloudiness, snow, ice, leaf 
  area and land cover changes.</p>
<p><b>Altimetry</b><br>
  A technique for the measurement of the elevation of the sea, land or ice surface. 
  For example, the height of the sea surface (with respect to the centre of the 
  Earth or, more conventionally, with respect to a standard "ellipsoid of revolution") 
  can be measured from space by current state-of-the-art radar altimetry with 
  centrimetric precision. Altimetry has the advantage of being a measurement relative 
  to a geocentric reference frame, rather than relative to land level as for a 
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">tide gauge, and of affording 
  quasi-global coverage.</p>
<p><b>Anthropogenic</b><br>
  Resulting from or produced by human beings.</p>
<p><b>Atmosphere</b><br>
  The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth. The dry atmosphere consists almost 
  entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume mixing ratio) and oxygen (20.9% volume mixing 
  ratio), together with a number of trace gases, such as argon (0.93% volume mixing 
  ratio), helium, and radiatively active <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">greenhouse 
  gases such as <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">carbon dioxide 
  (0.035% volume mixing ratio), and ozone. In addition the atmosphere contains 
  water vapour, whose amount is highly variable but typically 1% volume mixing 
  ratio. The atmosphere also contains clouds and <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">aerosols.</p>
<p><b>Attribution</b><br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Detection and attribution.</p>
<p><b>Autotrophic respiration</b><br>
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Respiration by photosynthetic 
  organisms (plants).</p>
<p><b>Biomass</b><br>
  The total mass of living organisms in a given area or volume; recently dead 
  plant material is often included as dead biomass.</p>
<p><b>Biosphere (terrestrial and marine)</b><br>
  The part of the Earth system comprising all <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">ecosystems 
  and living organisms, in the atmosphere, on land (terrestrial biosphere) or 
  in the oceans (marine biosphere), including derived dead organic matter, such 
  as litter, soil organic matter and oceanic detritus.</p>
<p><b>Black carbon</b><br>
  Operationally defined species based on measurement of light absorption and chemical 
  reactivity and/or thermal stability; consists of soot, charcoal, and/or possible 
  light-absorbing refractory organic matter. (Source: Charlson and Heintzenberg, 
  1995, p. 401.)</p>
<p><b>Burden</b><br>
  The total mass of a gaseous substance of concern in the atmosphere.</p>
<p><b>Carbonaceous aerosol</b><br>
  Aerosol consisting predominantly of organic substances and various forms of 
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">black carbon. (Source: Charlson 
  and Heintzenberg, 1995, p. 401.)</p>
<p><b>Carbon cycle</b><br>
  The term used to describe the flow of carbon (in various forms, e.g. as carbon 
  dioxide) through the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">biosphere 
  and lithosphere.</p>
<p><b>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</b><br>
  A naturally occurring gas, also a by-product of burning fossil fuels and <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">biomass, 
  as well as <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">land-use changes 
  and other industrial processes. It is the principal anthropogenic <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">greenhouse 
  gas that affects the earth's radiative balance. It is the reference gas against 
  which other greenhouse gases are measured and therefore has a <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Global 
  Warming Potential of 1.</p>
<p><b>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fertilisation</b><br>
  The enhancement of the growth of plants as a result of increased atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Depending on their mechanism of <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">photosynthesis, 
  certain types of plants are more sensitive to changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentratioin. In particular, <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">C<sub>3</sub> 
  plants generally show a larger response to CO<sub>2</sub> than <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">C<sub>4</sub> 
  plants.</p>
<p><b>Charcoal</b><br>
  Material resulting from charring of biomass, usually retaining some of the microscopic 
  texture typical of plant tissues; chemically it consists mainly of carbon with 
  a disturbed graphitic structure, with lesser amounts of oxygen and hydrogen. 
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Black carbon; Soot particles. 
  (Source: Charlson and Heintzenberg, 1995, p. 402.)</p>
<p><b>Climate</b><br>
  Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the "average weather", or more 
  rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability 
  of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands 
  or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World 
  Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables 
  such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the 
  state, including a statistical description, of the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  system.</p>
<p><b>Climate change</b><br>
  Climate change refers to a statistically significant variation in either the 
  mean state of the climate or in its variability, persisting for an extended 
  period (typically decades or longer). Climate change may be due to natural internal 
  processes or external forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the 
  composition of the atmosphere or in land use.<br>
  Note that the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Framework Convention 
  on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines "climate change" as: "a 
  change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity 
  that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition 
  to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods". The UNFCCC 
  thus makes a distinction between "climate change" attributable to human activities 
  altering the atmospheric composition, and "climate variability" attributable 
  to natural causes.<br>
  See also: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate variability.</p>
<p><b>Climate feedback</b><br>
  An interaction mechanism between processes in the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  system is called a climate feedback, when the result of an initial process triggers 
  changes in a second process that in turn influences the initial one. A positive 
  feedback intensifies the original process, and a negative feedback reduces it.</p>
<p><b>Climate model (hierarchy)</b><br>
  A numerical representation of the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  system based on the physical, chemical and biological properties of its components, 
  their interactions and feedback processes, and accounting for all or some of 
  its known properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying 
  complexity, i.e. for any one component or combination of components a hierarchy 
  of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial 
  dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical or biological processes are 
  explicitly represented, or the level at which empirical <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">parametrizations 
  are involved. Coupled atmosphere/ocean/sea-ice General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) 
  provide a comprehensive representation of the climate system. There is an evolution 
  towards more complex models with active chemistry and biology.<br>
  Climate models are applied, as a research tool, to study and simulate the climate, 
  but also for operational purposes, including monthly, seasonal and interannual 
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate predictions.</p>
<p><b>Climate prediction</b><br>
  A climate prediction or climate forecast is the result of an attempt to produce 
  a most likely description or estimate of the actual evolution of the climate 
  in the future, e.g. at seasonal, interannual or long-term time scales. See also: 
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate projection and <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate 
  (change) scenario.</p>
<p><b>Climate projection</b><br>
  A <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">projection of the response 
  of the climate system to <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">emission 
  or concentration scenarios of greenhouse gases and aerosols, or <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">radiative 
  forcing scenarios, often based upon simulations by <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  models. Climate projections are distinguished from <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  predictions in order to emphasise that climate projections depend upon the emission/concentration/ 
  radiative forcing scenario used, which are based on assumptions, concerning, 
  e.g., future socio-economic and technological developments, that may or may 
  not be realised, and are therefore subject to substantial uncertainty.</p>
<p><b>Climate scenario</b><br>
  A plausible and often simplified representation of the future climate, based 
  on an internally consistent set of climatological relationships, that has been 
  constructed for explicit use in investigating the potential consequences of 
  anthropogenic <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate change, 
  often serving as input to impact models. <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate 
  projections often serve as the raw material for constructing climate scenarios, 
  but climate scenarios usually require additional information such as about the 
  observed current climate. A climate change scenario is the difference between 
  a climate scenario and the current climate.</p>
<p><b>Climate sensitivity</b><br>
  In IPCC Reports, equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the equilibrium change 
  in global mean surface temperature following a doubling of the atmospheric (<img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">equivalent) 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. More generally, equilibrium climate sensitivity 
  refers to the equilibrium change in surface air temperature following a unit 
  change in <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">radiative forcing 
  (&deg;C/Wm<sup>-2</sup>). In practice, the evaluation of the equilibrium climate 
  sensitivity requires very long simulations with Coupled General Circulation 
  Models (<img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate model). <br>
  The effective climate sensitivity is a related measure that circumvents this 
  requirement. It is evaluated from model output for evolving non-equilibrium 
  conditions. It is a measure of the strengths of the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">feedbacks 
  at a particular time and may vary with forcing history and climate state. Details 
  are discussed in <a href="344.htm#921">Section 9.2.1</a> of <a href="338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a> in this Report.</p>
<p><b>Climate system</b><br>
  The climate system is the highly complex system consisting of five major components: 
  the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">atmosphere, the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">hydrosphere, 
  the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">cryosphere, the land surface 
  and the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">biosphere, and the 
  interactions between them. The climate system evolves in time under the influence 
  of its own internal dynamics and because of external forcings such as volcanic 
  eruptions, solar variations and human-induced forcings such as the changing 
  composition of the atmosphere and <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">land-use 
  change.</p>
<p><b>Climate variability</b><br>
  Climate variability refers to variations in the mean state and other statistics 
  (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the climate 
  on all temporal and spatial scales beyond that of individual weather events. 
  Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate system 
  (internal variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external 
  forcing (external variability). See also: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate 
  change.</p>
<p><b>Cloud condensation nuclei</b><br>
  Airborne particles that serve as an initial site for the condensation of liquid 
  water and which can lead to the formation of cloud droplets. See also: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Aerosols.<br>
  CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation<br>
  See <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) 
  fertilisation</p>
<p><b>Cooling degree days</b><br>
  The integral over a day of the temperature above 18&deg;C (e.g. a day with an 
  average temperature of 20&deg;C counts as 2 cooling degree days). See also: 
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Heating degree days.</p>
<p><b>Cryosphere</b><br>
  The component of the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  system consisting of all snow, ice and permafrost on and beneath the surface 
  of the earth and ocean. See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Glacier; 
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Ice sheet.</p>
<p><b>C<sub>3</sub> plants </b><br>
  Plants that produce a three-carbon compound during photo-synthesis; including 
  most trees and agricultural crops such as rice, wheat, soyabeans, potatoes and 
  vegetables.</p>
<p><b>C<sub>4</sub> plants </b><br>
  Plants that produce a four-carbon compound during photo-synthesis; mainly of 
  tropical origin, including grasses and the agriculturally important crops maize, 
  sugar cane, millet and sorghum.</p>
<p><b>Deforestation</b><br>
  Conversion of forest to non-forest. For a discussion of the term <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">forest 
  and related terms such as <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">afforestation, 
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">reforestation, and deforestation: 
  see the IPCC Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000).</p>
<p><b>Desertification</b><br>
  Land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas resulting from 
  various factors, including climatic variations and human activities. Further, 
  the UNCCD (The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification) defines 
  land degradation as a reduction or loss, in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid 
  areas, of the biological or economic productivity and complexity of rain-fed 
  cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest, and woodlands resulting 
  from land uses or from a process or combination of processes, including processes 
  arising from human activities and habitation patterns, such as: (i) soil erosion 
  caused by wind and/or water; (ii) deterioration of the physical, chemical and 
  biological or economic properties of soil; and (iii) long-term loss of natural 
  vegetation.</p>
<p><b>Detection and attribution</b><br>
  Climate varies continually on all time scales. Detection of <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  change is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed in some defined 
  statistical sense, without providing a reason for that change. Attribution of 
  causes of climate change is the process of establishing the most likely causes 
  for the detected change with some defined level of confidence.</p>
<p><b>Diurnal temperature range</b><br>
  The difference between the maximum and minimum temperature during a day.</p>
<p><b>Dobson Unit (DU)</b><br>
  A unit to measure the total amount of ozone in a vertical column above the Earth's 
  surface. The number of Dobson Units is the thickness in units of 10<sup>-5</sup> 
  m, that the ozone column would occupy if compressed into a layer of uniform 
  density at a pressure of 10<sup>13</sup> hPa, and a temperature of 0&deg;C. 
  One DU corresponds to a column of ozone containing 2.69 x10<sup>20</sup> molecules 
  per square meter. A typical value for the amount of ozone in a column of the 
  Earth's atmosphere, although very variable, is 300 DU.</p>
<p><b>Ecosystem</b><br>
  A system of interacting living organisms together with their physical environment. 
  The boundaries of what could be called an ecosystem are somewhat arbitrary, 
  depending on the focus of interest or study. Thus the extent of an ecosystem 
  may range from very small spatial scales to, ultimately, the entire Earth.</p>
<p><b>El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</b><br>
  El Ni&ntilde;o, in its original sense, is a warm water current which periodically 
  flows along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. This 
  oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of the intertropical surface 
  pressure pattern and circulation in the Indian and Pacific oceans, called the 
  Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere-ocean phenomenon is collectively 
  known as El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. During an El Ni&ntilde;o 
  event, the prevailing trade winds weaken and the equatorial countercurrent strengthens, 
  causing warm surface waters in the Indonesian area to flow eastward to overlie 
  the cold waters of the Peru current. This event has great impact on the wind, 
  sea surface temperature and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. 
  It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts 
  of the world. The opposite of an El Ni&ntilde;o event is called La Ni&ntilde;a.</p>
<p><b>Emission scenario</b><br>
  A plausible representation of the future development of emissions of substances 
  that are potentially radiatively active (e.g. <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">greenhouse 
  gases, <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">aerosols), based on 
  a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about driving forces 
  (such as demographic and socio-economic development, technological change) and 
  their key relationships.<br>
  Concentration scenarios, derived from emission scenarios, are used as input 
  into a climate model to compute <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  projections.<br>
  In IPCC (1992) a set of emission scenarios was presented which were used as 
  a basis for the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate projections 
  in IPCC (1996). These emission scenarios are referred to as the IS92 scenarios. 
  In the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; 
  et al., 2000) new emission scenarios, the so called <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">SRES 
  scenarios, were published some of which were used, among others, as a basis 
  for the climate projections presented in <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a> of 
  this Report. For the meaning of some terms related to these scenarios, see <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">SRES 
  scenarios.</p>
<p><b>Energy balance</b><br>
  Averaged over the globe and over longer time periods, the energy budget of the 
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate system must be in 
  balance. Because the climate system derives all its energy from the Sun, this 
  balance implies that, globally, the amount of incoming <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">solar 
  radiation must on average be equal to the sum of the outgoing reflected solar 
  radiation and the outgoing <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">infrared 
  radiation emitted by the climate system. A perturbation of this global radiation 
  balance, be it human induced or natural, is called <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">radiative 
  forcing.</p>
<p><b>Equilibrium and transient climate experiment</b><br>
  An equilibrium climate experiment is an experiment in which a <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  model is allowed to fully adjust to a change in <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">radiative 
  forcing. Such experiments provide information on the difference between the 
  initial and final states of the model, but not on the time-dependent response. 
  If the forcing is allowed to evolve gradually according to a prescribed <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">emission 
  scenario, the time dependent response of a climate model may be analysed. Such 
  experiment is called a transient climate experiment. See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate 
  projection.</p>
<p><b>Equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide)</b><br>
  The concentration of <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">CO<sub>2</sub> 
  that would cause the same amount of <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">radiative 
  forcing as a given mixture of CO<sub>2</sub> and other <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">greenhouse 
  gases.</p>
<p><b>Eustatic sea-level change</b><br>
  A change in global average sea level brought about by an alteration to the volume 
  of the world ocean. This may be caused by changes in water density or in the 
  total mass of water. In discussions of changes on geological time-scales, this 
  term sometimes also includes changes in global average sea level caused by an 
  alteration to the shape of the ocean basins. In this Report the term is not 
  used with that sense.</p>
<p><b>Evapotranspiration</b><br>
  The combined process of evaporation from the Earth's surface and transpiration 
  from vegetation.</p>
<p><b>External forcing</b><br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate system.</p>
<p><b>Extreme weather event</b><br>
  An extreme weather event is an event that is rare within its statistical reference 
  distribution at a particular place. Definitions of "rare" vary, but an extreme 
  weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile. 
  By definition, the characteristics of what is called extreme weather may vary 
  from place to place.<br>
  An extreme climate event is an average of a number of weather events over a 
  certain period of time, an average which is itself extreme (e.g. rainfall over 
  a season).</p>
<p><b>Faculae</b><br>
  Bright patches on the Sun. The area covered by faculae is greater during periods 
  of high <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">solar activity.</p>
<p><b>Feedback</b><br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate feedback.</p>
<p><b>Flux adjustment</b><br>
  To avoid the problem of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models 
  drifting into some unrealistic climate state, adjustment terms can be applied 
  to the atmosphere-ocean fluxes of heat and moisture (and sometimes the surface 
  stresses resulting from the effect of the wind on the ocean surface) before 
  these fluxes are imposed on the model ocean and atmosphere. Because these adjustments 
  are precomputed and therefore independent of the coupled model integration, 
  they are uncorrelated to the anomalies which develop during the integration.

  models have a reduced need for flux adjustment.</p>
<p><b>Forest</b><br>
  A vegetation type dominated by trees. Many definitions of the term forest are 
  in use throughout the world, reflecting wide differences in bio-geophysical 
  conditions, social structure, and economics. For a discussion of the term forest

  Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> resulting from the combustion of fuels from fossil 
  carbon deposits such as oil, gas and coal. </p>
<p><b>Framework Convention on Climate Change<br>
  </b>See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">United Nations Framework 
  Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>
<p><b>General Circulation </b><br>
  The large scale motions of the atmosphere and the ocean as a consequence of 
  differential heating on a rotating Earth, aiming to restore the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">energy 
  balance of the system through transport of heat and momentum.</p>
<p><b>General Circulation Model (GCM)</b><br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate model.</p>
<p><b>Geoid</b><br>
  The surface which an ocean of uniform density would assume if it were in steady 
  state and at rest (i.e. no ocean circulation and no applied forces other than 
  the gravity of the Earth). This implies that the geoid will be a surface of 
  constant gravitational potential, which can serve as a reference surface to 
  which all surfaces (e.g., the Mean Sea Surface) can be referred. The geoid (and 
  surfaces parallel to the geoid) are what we refer to in common experience as 
  "level surfaces".</p>
<p><b>Glacier</b><br>
  A mass of land ice flowing downhill (by internal deformation and sliding at 
  the base) and constrained by the surrounding topography e.g. the sides of a 
  valley or surrounding peaks; the bedrock topography is the major influence on 
  the dynamics and surface slope of a glacier. A glacier is maintained by accumulation 
  of snow at high altitudes, balanced by melting at low altitudes or discharge 
  into the sea.</p>
<p><b>Global surface temperature</b><br>
  The global surface temperature is the area-weighted global average of (i) the 
  sea-surface temperature over the oceans (i.e. the subsurface bulk temperature 
  in the first few meters of the ocean), and (ii) the surface-air temperature 
  over land at 1.5 m above the ground.</p>
<p><b>Global Warming Potential (GWP)</b><br>
  An index, describing the radiative characteristics of well mixed <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">greenhouse 
  gases, that represents the combined effect of the differing times these gases 
  remain in the atmosphere and their relative effectiveness in absorbing outgoing 
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">infrared radiation. This index 
  approximates the time-integrated warming effect of a unit mass of a given greenhouse 
  gas in today's atmosphere, relative to that of <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">carbon 
  dioxide.</p>
<p><b>Greenhouse effect </b><br>
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Greenhouse gases effectively 
  absorb <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">infrared radiation, 
  emitted by the Earth's surface, by the atmosphere itself due to the same gases, 
  and by clouds. Atmospheric radiation is emitted to all sides, including downward 
  to the Earth's surface. Thus greenhouse gases trap heat within the surface-troposphere 
  system. This is called the <i>natural greenhouse effect</i>.<br>
  Atmospheric radiation is strongly coupled to the temperature of the level at 
  which it is emitted. In the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">troposphere 
  the temperature generally decreases with height. Effectively, infrared radiation 
  emitted to space originates from an altitude with a temperature of, on average, 
  -19&deg;C, in balance with the net incoming solar radiation, whereas the Earth's 
  surface is kept at a much higher temperature of, on average, +14&deg;C.<br>
  An increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases leads to an increased infrared 
  opacity of the atmosphere, and therefore to an effective radiation into space 
  from a higher altitude at a lower temperature. This causes a <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">radiative 
  forcing, an imbalance that can only be compensated for by an increase of the 
  temperature of the surface-troposphere system. This is the enhanced greenhouse 
  effect.</p>
<p><b>Greenhouse gas</b><br>
  Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural 
  and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within 
  the spectrum of infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, the atmosphere 
  and clouds. This property causes the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">greenhouse 
  effect. Water vapour (H<sub>2</sub>O), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrous 
  oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) are 
  the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Moreover there are a 
  number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as the 
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">halocarbons and other chlorine 
  and bromine containing substances, dealt with under the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Montreal 
  Protocol. Beside CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub>, the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Kyoto 
  Protocol deals with the greenhouse gases sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>), 
  hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).</p>
<p><b>Gross Primary Production (GPP)</b><br>
  The amount of carbon fixed from the atmosphere through <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">photosynthesis.</p>
<p><b>Grounding line/zone</b><br>
  The junction between <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">ice sheet 
  and <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">ice shelf or the place 
  where the ice starts to float. </p>
<p><b>Halocarbons</b><br>
  Compounds containing either chlorine, bromine or fluorine and carbon. Such compounds 
  can act as powerful <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">greenhouse 
  gases in the atmosphere. The chlorine and bromine containing halocarbons are 
  also involved in the depletion of the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">ozone 
  layer.</p>
<p><b>Heating degree days</b><br>
  The integral over a day of the temperature below 18&deg;C (e.g. a day with an 
  average temperature of 16&deg;C counts as 2 heating degree days). See also: 
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Cooling degree days.</p>
<p><b>Heterotrophic respiration</b><br>
  The conversion of organic matter to CO<sub>2</sub> by organisms other than plants.</p>
<p><b>Hydrosphere</b><br>
  The component of the climate system comprising liquid surface and subterranean 
  water, such as: oceans, seas, rivers, fresh water lakes, underground water etc. 
</p>
<p><b>Ice cap</b><br>
  A dome shaped ice mass covering a highland area that is considerably smaller 
  in extent than an<img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">ice sheet.</p>
<p><b>Ice sheet</b><br>
  A mass of land ice which is sufficiently deep to cover most of the underlying 
  bedrock topography, so that its shape is mainly determined by its internal dynamics 
  (the flow of the ice as it deforms internally and slides at its base). An ice 
  sheet flows outwards from a high central plateau with a small average surface 
  slope. The margins slope steeply, and the ice is discharged through fast-flowing 
  ice streams or outlet glaciers, in some cases into the sea or into ice-shelves 
  floating on the sea. There are only two large ice sheets in the modern world, 
  on Greenland and Antarctica, the Antarctic ice sheet being divided into East 
  and West by the Transantarctic Mountains; during glacial periods there were 
  others. </p>
<p><b>Ice shelf</b><br>
  A floating <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">ice sheet of considerable 
  thickness attached to a coast (usually of great horizontal extent with a level 
  or gently undulating surface); often a seaward extension of ice sheets.</p>
<p><b>Indirect aerosol effect</b><br>
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Aerosols may lead to an indirect 
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">radiative forcing of the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  system through acting as condensation nuclei or modifying the optical properties 
  and lifetime of clouds. Two indirect effects are distinguished:<br>
  First indirect effect<br>
  A radiative forcing induced by an increase in anthropogenic aerosols which cause 
  an initial increase in droplet concentration and a decrease in droplet size 
  for fixed liquid water content, leading to an increase of cloud <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">albedo. 
  This effect is also known as the Twomey effect. This is sometimes referred to 
  as the cloud albedo effect. However this is highly misleading since the second 
  indirect effect also alters cloud albedo.<br>
  Second indirect effect<br>
  A radiative forcing induced by an increase in anthropogenic aerosols which cause 
  a decrease in droplet size, reducing the precipitation efficiency, thereby modifying 
  the liquid water content, cloud thickness, and cloud life time. This effect 
  is also known as the cloud life time effect or Albrecht effect.</p>
<p><b>Industrial revolution</b><br>
  A period of rapid industrial growth with far-reaching social and economic consequences, 
  beginning in England during the second half of the eighteenth century and spreading 
  to Europe and later to other countries including the United States. The invention 
  of the steam engine was an important trigger of this development. The industrial 
  revolution marks the beginning of a strong increase in the use of fossil fuels 
  and emission of, in particular, fossil carbon dioxide. In this Report the terms 
  pre-industrial and industrial refer, somewhat arbitrarily, to the periods before 
  and after 1750, respectively.</p>
<p><b>Infrared radiation</b><br>
  Radiation emitted by the earth's surface, the atmosphere and the clouds. It 
  is also known as terrestrial or long-wave radiation. Infrared radiation has 
  a distinctive range of wavelengths ("spectrum") longer than the wavelength of 
  the red colour in the visible part of the spectrum. The spectrum of infrared 
  radiation is practically distinct from that of <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">solar 
  or short-wave radiation because of the difference in temperature between the 
  Sun and the Earth-atmosphere system.</p>
<p><b>Integrated assessment</b><br>
  A method of analysis that combines results and models from the physical, biological, 
  economic and social sciences, and the interactions between these components, 
  in a consistent framework, to evaluate the status and the consequences of environmental 
  change and the policy responses to it.</p>
<p><b>Internal variability</b><br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate variability.</p>
<p><b>Inverse modelling</b><br>
  A mathematical procedure by which the input to a model is estimated from the 
  observed outcome, rather than vice versa. It is, for instance, used to estimate 
  the location and strength of sources and sinks of CO<sub>2</sub> from measurements 
  of the distribution of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere, given 
  models of the global <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">carbon 
  cycle and for computing atmospheric transport.</p>
<p><b>Isostatic land movements</b><br>
  Isostasy refers to the way in which the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">lithosphere 
  and mantle respond to changes in surface loads. When the loading of the lithosphere 
  is changed by alterations in land ice mass, ocean mass, sedimentation, erosion 
  or mountain building, vertical isostatic adjustment results, in order to balance 
  the new load.</p>
<p><b>Kyoto Protocol</b><br>
  The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Framework 
  Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted at the Third Session of the 
  Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Framework 
  Convention on Climate Change, in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan. It contains legally binding 
  commitments, in addition to those included in the UNFCCC. Countries included 
  in Annex B of the Protocol (most OECD countries and countries with economies 
  in transition) agreed to reduce their anthropogenic <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">greenhouse 
  gas emissions (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, HFCs, PFCs, and 
  SF<sub>6</sub>) by at least 5% below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 
  to 2012. The Kyoto Protocol has not yet entered into force (April 2001).</p>
<p><b>Land use</b><br>
  The total of arrangements, activities and inputs undertaken in a certain land 
  cover type (a set of human actions). The social and economic purposes for which 
  land is managed (e.g., grazing, timber extraction, and conservation).</p>
<p><b>Land-use change</b><br>
  A change in the use or management of land by humans, which may lead to a change 
  in land cover. Land cover and land-use change may have an impact on the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">albedo,

  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern 
  Oscillation.</p>
<p><b>Lifetime </b><br>
  Lifetime is a general term used for various time-scales characterising the rate 
  of processes affecting the concentration of trace gases. The following lifetimes 
  may be distinguished:<br>
  Turnover time (T) is the ratio of the mass M of a reservoir (e.g., a gaseous 
  compound in the atmosphere) and the total rate of removal S from the reservoir: 
  T = M/S. For each removal process separate turnover times can be defined. In 
  soil carbon biology this is referred to as Mean Residence Time (MRT).<br>
  Adjustment time or response time (Ta) is the time-scale characterising the decay 
  of an instantaneous pulse input into the reservoir. The term adjustment time 
  is also used to characterise the adjustment of the mass of a reservoir following 
  a step change in the source strength. Half-life or decay constant is used to 
  quantify a first-order exponential decay process. See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Response 
  time, for a different definition pertinent to climate variations. The term lifetime 
  is sometimes used, for simplicity, as a surrogate for adjustment time.<br>
  In simple cases, where the global removal of the compound is directly proportional 
  to the total mass of the reservoir, the adjustment time equals the turnover 
  time: T = Ta. An example is CFC-11 which is removed from the atmosphere only 
  by photochemical processes in the stratosphere. In more complicated cases, where 
  several reservoirs are involved or where the removal is not proportional to 
  the total mass, the equality T = Ta no longer holds. <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Carbon 
  dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is an extreme example. Its turnover time is only about 
  4 years because of the rapid exchange between atmosphere and the ocean and terrestrial 
  biota. However, a large part of that CO<sub>2</sub> is returned to the atmosphere 
  within a few years. Thus, the adjustment time of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere 
  is actually determined by the rate of removal of carbon from the surface layer 
  of the oceans into its deeper layers. Although an approximate value of 100 years 
  may be given for the adjustment time of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere, the 
  actual adjustment is faster initially and slower later on. In the case of methane 
  (CH<sub>4</sub>) the adjustment time is different from the turnover time, because 
  the removal is mainly through a chemical reaction with the hydroxyl radical 
  OH, the concentration of which itself depends on the CH<sub>4</sub> concentration. 
  Therefore the CH<sub>4</sub> removal S is not proportional to its total mass 
  M. </p>
<p><b>Lithosphere</b><br>
  The upper layer of the solid Earth, both continental and oceanic, which comprises 
  all crustal rocks and the cold, mainly elastic, part of the uppermost mantle. 
  Volcanic activity, although part of the lithosphere, is not considered as part 
  of the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate system, but 
  acts as an external forcing factor. See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Isostatic 
  land movements.</p>
<p><b>LOSU (Level of Scientific Understanding)</b><br>
  This is an index on a 4-step scale (High, Medium, Low and Very Low) designed 
  to characterise the degree of scientific understanding of the radiative forcing 
  agents that affect climate change. For each agent, the index represents a subjective 
  judgement about the reliability of the estimate of its forcing, involving such 
  factors as the assumptions necessary to evaluate<br>
  the forcing, the degree of knowledge of the physical/ chemical mechanisms determining 
  the forcing and the uncertainties surrounding the quantitative estimate.</p>
<p><b>Mean Sea Level</b><br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Relative Sea Level.</p>
<p><b>Mitigation</b><br>
  A human intervention to reduce the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">sources 
  or enhance the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">sinks of <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">greenhouse

<p><b>Model hierarchy</b><br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate model.</p>
<p><b>Mole fraction</b><br>
  Mole fraction, or mixing ratio, is the ratio of the number of moles of a constituent 
  in a given volume to the total number of moles of all constituents in that volume. 
  It is usually reported for dry air. Typical values for long-lived <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">greenhouse 
  gases are in the order of mmol/mol (parts per million: ppm), nmol/mol (parts 
  per billion: ppb), and fmol/mol (parts per trillion: ppt). Mole fraction differs 
  from volume mixing ratio, often expressed in ppmv etc., by the corrections for 
  non-ideality of gases. This correction is significant relative to measurement 
  precision for many greenhouse gases. (Source: Schwartz and Warneck, 1995).</p>
<p><b>Montreal Protocol</b><br>
  The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was adopted 
  in Montreal in 1987, and subsequently adjusted and amended in London (1990), 
  Copenhagen (1992), Vienna (1995), Montreal (1997) and Beijing (1999). It controls 
  the consumption and production of chlorine- and bromine-containing chemicals 
  that destroy stratospheric ozone, such as CFCs, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 
  and many others.</p>
<p><b>Net Biome Production (NBP)</b><br>
  Net gain or loss of carbon from a region. NBP is equal to the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Net 
  Ecosystem Production minus the carbon lost due to a disturbance, e.g. a forest 
  fire or a forest harvest.</p>
<p><b>Net Ecosystem Production (NEP)</b><br>
  Net gain or loss of carbon from an <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">ecosystem. 
  NEP is equal to the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Net Primary 
  Production minus the carbon lost through <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">heterotrophic 
  respiration.</p>
<p><b>Net Primary Production (NPP)</b><br>
  The increase in plant <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">biomass 
  or carbon of a unit of a landscape. NPP is equal to the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Gross 
  Primary Production minus carbon lost through <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">autotrophic 
  respiration.</p>
<p><b>Nitrogen fertilisation</b><br>
  Enhancement of plant growth through the addition of nitrogen compounds. In IPCC 
  Reports, this typically refers to fertilisation from anthropogenic sources of 
  nitrogen such as human-made fertilisers and nitrogen oxides released from burning 
  fossil fuels.</p>
<p><b>Non-linearity</b><br>
  A process is called "non-linear" when there is no simple proportional relation 
  between cause and effect. The <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  system contains many such non-linear processes, resulting in a system with a 
  potentially very complex behaviour. Such complexity may lead to <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">rapid 
  climate change.</p>
<p><b>North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)</b><br>
  The North Atlantic Oscillation consists of opposing variations of barometric 
  pressure near Iceland and near the Azores. On average, a westerly current, between 
  the Icelandic low pressure area and the Azores high pressure area, carries cyclones 
  with their associated frontal systems towards Europe. However, the pressure 
  difference between Iceland and the Azores fluctuates on time-scales of days 
  to decades, and can be reversed at times.</p>
<p><b>Organic aerosol</b><br>
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Aerosol particles consisting 
  predominantly of organic compounds, mainly C, H, O, and lesser amounts of other 
  elements. (Source: Charlson and Heintzenberg, 1995, p. 405.) See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Carbonaceous 
  aerosol.</p>
<p><b>Ozone</b><br>
  Ozone, the triatomic form of oxygen (O<sub>3</sub>), is a gaseous atmospheric 
  constituent. In the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">troposphere 
  it is created both naturally and by photochemical reactions involving gases 
  resulting from human activities ("smog"). Tropospheric ozone acts as a <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">greenhouse 
  gas. In the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">stratosphere it 
  is created by the interaction between solar ultraviolet radiation and molecular 
  oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). Stratospheric ozone plays a decisive role in the stratospheric 
  radiative balance. Its concentration is highest in the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">ozone 
  layer. </p>
<p><b>Ozone hole</b><br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Ozone layer.</p>
<p><b>Ozone layer</b><br>
  The <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">stratosphere contains 
  a layer in which the concentration of ozone is greatest, the so called ozone 
  layer. The layer extends from about 12 to 40 km. The ozone concentration reaches 
  a maximum between about 20 and 25 km. This layer is being depleted by human 
  emissions of chlorine and bromine compounds. Every year, during the Southern 
  Hemisphere spring, a very strong depletion of the ozone layer takes place over 
  the Antarctic region, also caused by human-made chlorine and bromine compounds 
  in combination with the specific meteorological conditions of that region. This 
  phenomenon is called the ozone hole.</p>
<p><b>Parametrization</b><br>
  In <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate models, this term 
  refers to the technique of representing processes, that cannot be explicitly 
  resolved at the spatial or temporal resolution of the model (sub-grid scale 
  processes), by relationships between the area or time averaged effect of such 
  sub-grid scale processes and the larger scale flow.</p>
<p><b>Patterns of climate variability</b><br>
  Natural variability of the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  system, in particular on seasonal and longer time-scales, predominantly occurs 
  in preferred spatial patterns, through the dynamical non-linear characteristics 
  of the atmospheric circulation and through interactions with the land and ocean 
  surfaces. Such spatial patterns are also called "regimes" or "modes". Examples 
  are the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">North Atlantic Oscillation 
  (NAO), the Pacific-North American pattern (PNA), the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">El 
  Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Antarctic Oscillation (AO).</p>
<p><b>Photosynthesis</b><br>
  The process by which plants take CO<sub>2</sub> from the air (or bicarbonate 
  in water) to build carbohydrates, releasing O<sub>2</sub> in the process. There 
  are several pathways of photosynthesis with different responses to atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Carbon

<p><b>Projection (generic)</b><br>
  A projection is a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, 
  often computed with the aid of a model. Projections are distinguished from predictions 
  in order to emphasise that projections involve assumptions concerning, e.g., 
  future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be 
  realised, and are therefore subject to substantial uncertainty. See also <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate 
  projection; <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate prediction.</p>
<p><b>Proxy</b><br>
  A proxy climate indicator is a local record that is interpreted, using physical 
  and biophysical principles, to represent some combination of climate-related 
  variations back in time. Climate related data derived in this way are referred 
  to as proxy data. Examples of proxies are: tree ring records, characteristics 
  of corals, and various data derived from ice cores.</p>
<p><b>Radiative forcing</b><br>
  Radiative forcing is the change in the net vertical irradiance (expressed in 
  Watts per square metre: Wm<sup>-2</sup>) at the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">tropopause 
  due to an internal change or a change in the external forcing of the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  system, such as, for example, a change in the concentration of <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">carbon 
  dioxide or the output of the Sun. Usually radiative forcing is computed after 
  allowing for stratospheric temperatures to readjust to radiative equilibrium, 
  but with all tropospheric properties held fixed at their unperturbed values. 
  Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if no change in stratospheric temperature 
  is accounted for. Practical problems with this definition, in particular with 
  respect to radiative forcing associated with changes, by aerosols, of the precipitation 
  formation by clouds, are discussed in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a> of this 
  Report.</p>
<p><b>Radiative forcing scenario</b><br>
  A plausible representation of the future development of <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">radiative 
  forcing associated, for example, with changes in atmospheric composition or 
  land-use change, or with external factors such as variations in <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">solar 
  activity. Radiative forcing scenarios can be used as input into simplified <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  models to compute <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  projections.</p>
<p><b>Radio-echosounding</b><br>
  The surface and bedrock, and hence the thickness, of a glacier can be mapped 
  by radar; signals penetrating the ice are reflected at the lower boundary with 
  rock (or water, for a floating glacier tongue).</p>
<p><b>Rapid climate change</b><br>
  The <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">non-linearity of the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  system may lead to rapid climate change, sometimes called abrupt events or even 
  surprises. Some such abrupt events may be imaginable, such as a dramatic reorganisation 
  of the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">thermohaline circulation, 
  rapid deglaciation, or massive melting of permafrost leading to fast changes 
  in the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">carbon cycle. Others 
  may be truly unexpected, as a consequence of a strong, rapidly changing, forcing 
  of a non-linear system.</p>
<p><b>Reforestation</b><br>
  Planting of forests on lands that have previously contained forests but that 
  have been converted to some other use. For a discussion of the term <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">forest 
  and related terms such as <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">afforestation, 
  reforestation, and <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">deforestation: 
  see the IPCC Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000).</p>
<p><b>Regimes</b><br>
  Preferred <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">patterns of climate 
  variability.</p>
<p><b>Relative Sea Level</b><br>
  Sea level measured by a <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">tide 
  gauge with respect to the land upon which it is situated. Mean Sea Level (MSL) 
  is normally defined as the average Relative Sea Level over a period, such as 
  a month or a year, long enough to average out transients such as waves.</p>
<p><b>(Relative) Sea Level Secular Change</b><br>
  Long term changes in relative sea level caused by either <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">eustatic 
  changes, e.g. brought about by <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">thermal 
  expansion, or changes in vertical land movements.</p>
<p><b>Reservoir</b><br>
  A component of the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  system, other than the atmosphere, which has the capacity to store, accumulate 
  or release a substance of concern, e.g. carbon, a <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">greenhouse 
  gas or a <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">precursor. Oceans, 
  soils, and <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">forests are examples 
  of reservoirs of carbon. Pool is an equivalent term (note that the definition 
  of pool often includes the atmosphere). The absolute quantity of substance of 
  concerns, held within a reservoir at a specified time, is called the stock.</p>
<p><b>Respiration</b><br>
  The process whereby living organisms convert organic matter to CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  releasing energy and consuming O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p><b>Response time</b><br>
  The response time or adjustment time is the time needed for the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate 
  system or its components to re-equilibrate to a new state, following a forcing 
  resultinsg from external and internal processes or <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">feedbacks. 
  It is very different for various components of the climate system. The response 
  time of the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">troposphere is 
  relatively short, from days to weeks, whereas the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">stratosphere 
  comes into equilibrium on a time-scale of typically a few months. Due to their 
  large heat capacity, the oceans have a much longer response time, typically 
  decades, but up to centuries or millennia. The response time of the strongly 
  coupled surface-troposphere system is, therefore, slow compared to that of the 
  stratosphere, and mainly determined by the oceans. The <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">biosphere 
  may respond fast, e.g. to droughts, but also very slowly to imposed changes.<br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Lifetime, for a different 
  definition of response time pertinent to the rate of processes affecting the 
  concentration of trace gases.</p>
<p><b>Scenario (generic)</b><br>
  A plausible and often simplified description of how the future may develop, 
  based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about driving 
  forces and key relationships. Scenarios may be derived from <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">projections, 
  but are often based on additional information from other sources, sometimes 
  combined with a "narrative storyline". See also: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">SRES 
  scenarios; <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Climate scenario;

<p><b>Sequestration</b><br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Uptake.</p>
<p><b>Significant wave height</b><br>
  The average height of the highest one-third of all sea waves occurring in a 
  particular time period. This serves as an indicator of the characteristic size 
  of the highest waves.</p>
<p><b>Sink</b><br>
  Any process, activity or mechanism which removes a <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">greenhouse

  of a greenhouse gas or aerosol from the atmosphere.</p>
<p><b>Soil moisture</b><br>
  Water stored in or at the land surface and available for evaporation.</p>
<p><b>Solar activity</b><br>
  The Sun exhibits periods of high activity observed in numbers of <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">sunspots, 
  as well as radiative output, magnetic activity, and emission of high energy 
  particles. These variations take place on a range of time-scales from millions 
  of years to minutes. See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Solar 
  cycle.</p>
<p><b>Solar ("11 year") cycle</b><br>
  A quasi-regular modulation of <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">solar 
  activity with varying amplitude and a period of between 9 and 13 years.</p>
<p><b>Solar radiation</b><br>
  Radiation emitted by the Sun. It is also referred to as short-wave radiation. 
  Solar radiation has a distinctive range of wavelengths (spectrum) determined 
  by the temperature of the Sun. See also: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Infrared 
  radiation.</p>
<p><b>Soot particles</b><br>
  Particles formed during the quenching of gases at the outer edge of flames of 
  organic vapours, consisting predominantly of carbon, with lesser amounts of 
  oxygen and hydrogen present as carboxyl and phenolic groups and exhibiting an 
  imperfect graphitic structure. See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Black 
  carbon; Charcoal. (Source: Charlson and Heintzenberg, 1995, p. 406.)</p>
<p><b>Source</b><br>
  Any process, activity or mechanism which releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol 
  or a precursor of a greenhouse gas or aerosol into the atmosphere. </p>
<p><b>Spatial and temporal scales</b><br>
  Climate may vary on a large range of spatial and temporal scales. Spatial scales 
  may range from local (less than 100,000 km<sup>2</sup>), through regional (100,000 
  to 10 million km<sup>2</sup>) to continental (10 to 100 million km<sup>2</sup>). 
  Temporal scales may range from seasonal to geological (up to hundreds of millions 
  of years).</p>
<p><b>SRES scenarios</b><br>
  SRES scenarios are <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">emission 
  scenarios developed by Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al. (2000) and used, among 
  others, as a basis for the climate projections in <a href="338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a> of this Report. The following terms are relevant for a better understanding 
  of the structure and use of the set of SRES scenarios:<br>
  <b><i>(Scenario) Family</i></b><br>
  Scenarios that have a similar demographic, societal, economic and technical-change 
  storyline. Four scenario families comprise the SRES scenario set: A1, A2, B1 
  and B2.<br>
  <b><i>(Scenario) Group</i></b><br>
  Scenarios within a family that reflect a consistent variation of the storyline. 
  The A1 scenario family includes four groups designated as A1T, A1C, A1G and 
  A1B that explore alternative structures of future energy systems. In the Summary 
  for Policymakers of Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al. (2000), the A1C and A1G 
  groups have been combined into one &#145;Fossil Intensive' A1FI scenario group. 
  The other three scenario families consist of one group each. The SRES scenario 
  set reflected in the Summary for Policymakers of Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et 
  al. (2000) thus consist of six distinct scenario groups, all of which are equally 
  sound and together capture the range of uncertainties associated with driving 
  forces and emissions.<br>
  <b><i>Illustrative Scenario</i></b><br>
  A scenario that is illustrative for each of the six scenario groups reflected 
  in the Summary for Policymakers of Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al. (2000). 
  They include four revised &#145;scenario markers' for the scenario groups A1B, 
  A2, B1, B2, and two additional scenarios for the A1FI and A1T groups. All scenario 
  groups are equally sound. <br>
  <b><i>(Scenario) Marker</i></b><br>
  A scenario that was originally posted in draft form on the SRES website to represent 
  a given scenario family. The choice of markers was based on which of the initial 
  quantifications best reflected the storyline, and the features of specific models. 
  Markers are no more likely than other scenarios, but are considered by the SRES 
  writing team as illustrative of a particular storyline. They are included in 
  revised form in Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al. (2000). These scenarios have 
  received the closest scrutiny of the entire writing team and via the SRES open 
  process. Scenarios have also been selected to illustrate the other two scenario 
  groups (see also &#145;Scenario Group' and &#145;Illustrative Scenario').<br>
  <b><i>(Scenario) Storyline</i></b><br>
  A narrative description of a scenario (or family of scenarios) highlighting 
  the main scenario characteristics, relationships between key driving forces 
  and the dynamics of their evolution.</p>
<p><b>Stock</b><br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Reservoir.</p>
<p><b>Storm surge</b><br>
  The temporary increase, at a particular locality, in the height of the sea due 
  to extreme meteorological conditions (low atmospheric pressure and/or strong 
  winds). The storm surge is defined as being the excess above the level expected 
  from the tidal variation alone at that time and place.</p>
<p><b>Stratosphere</b><br>
  The highly stratified region of the atmosphere above the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">troposphere 
  extending from about 10 km (ranging from 9 km in high latitudes to 16 km in 
  the tropics on average) to about 50 km. </p>
<p><b>Sunspots</b><br>
  Small dark areas on the Sun. The number of sunspots is higher during periods 
  of high <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">solar activity, and 
  varies in particular with the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">solar 
  cycle.</p>
<p><b>Thermal expansion</b><br>
  In connection with sea level, this refers to the increase in volume (and decrease 
  in density) that results from warming water. A warming of the ocean leads to 
  an expansion of the ocean volume and hence an increase in sea level.</p>
<p><b>Thermohaline circulation</b><br>
  Large-scale density-driven circulation in the ocean, caused by differences in 
  temperature and salinity. In the North Atlantic the thermohaline circulation 
  consists of warm surface water flowing northward and cold deep water flowing 
  southward, resulting in a net poleward transport of heat. The surface water 
  sinks in highly restricted sinking regions located in high latitudes.</p>
<p><b>Tide gauge</b><br>
  A device at a coastal location (and some deep sea locations) which continuously 
  measures the level of the sea with respect to the adjacent land. Time-averaging 
  of the sea level so recorded gives the observed <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Relative 
  Sea Level Secular Changes.</p>
<p><b>Transient climate response</b><br>
  The globally averaged surface air temperature increase, averaged over a 20 year 
  period, centred at the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling, i.e., at year 70 in 
  a 1% per year compound CO<sub>2</sub> increase experiment with a global coupled 
  <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">climate model.</p>
<p><b>Tropopause</b><br>
  The boundary between the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">troposphere 
  and the <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">stratosphere.</p>
<p><b>Troposphere</b><br>
  The lowest part of the atmosphere from the surface to about 10 km in altitude 
  in mid-latitudes (ranging from 9 km in high latitudes to 16 km in the tropics 
  on average) where clouds and "weather" phenomena occur. In the troposphere temperatures 
  generally decrease with height.</p>
<p><b>Turnover time</b><br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Lifetime.</p>
<p><b>Uncertainty</b><br>
  An expression of the degree to which a value (e.g. the future state of the climate 
  system) is unknown. Uncertainty can result from lack of information or from 
  disagreement about what is known or even knowable. It may have many types of 
  sources, from quantifiable errors in the data to ambiguously defined concepts 
  or terminology, or uncertain projections of human behaviour. Uncertainty can 
  therefore be represented by quantitative measures (e.g. a range of values calculated 
  by various models) or by qualitative statements (e.g., reflecting the judgement 
  of a team of experts). See Moss and Schneider (2000).</p>
<p><b>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC)</b><br>
  The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992 in New York and signed at the 1992 
  Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro by more than 150 countries and the European Community. 
  Its ultimate objective is the "stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations 
  in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference 
  with the climate system". It contains commitments for all Parties. Under the 
  Convention, Parties included in Annex I aim to return greenhouse gas emissions 
  not controlled by the Montreal Protocol to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The 
  convention entered into force in March 1994. See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Kyoto 
  Protocol.</p>
<p><b>Uptake</b><br>
  The addition of a substance of concern to a <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">reservoir. 
  The uptake of carbon containing substances, in particular carbon dioxide, is 
  often called (carbon) sequestration.</p>
<p><b>Volume mixing ratio</b><br>
  See: <img src="images/r_arr.gif" width="16" height="7">Mole fraction.</p>
