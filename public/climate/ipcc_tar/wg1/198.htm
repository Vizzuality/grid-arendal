<p> The resulting overall uncertainty in the forcing by aerosols associated with 
  fossil fuels and other industrial emissions is &plusmn; 0.42 Wm<sup>-2</sup>; 
  that is, if the global mean forcing is evaluated as -0.6 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (the 
  row value calculated by using the central values in the forcing equation), then 
  the range of estimated global mean forcing is -0.1 to -1.0 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. 
  This range encompasses values for recent evaluations of the forcing for the 
  individual components comprising the industrial aerosols (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>). The main uncertainties are those for the upscatter fraction, the burden 
  (which includes the propagated uncertainties in emissions), and the mass scattering 
  efficiency, in that order. If the mode of mixing of black carbon were assumed 
  to be external, instead of internal as used here, then the uncertainty range 
  would be similar, but the central value for fossil fuel aerosols might be -0.7 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup> instead of -0.6 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. </p>
<p> The overall uncertainty in the forcing by biomass aerosols is &plusmn; 0.24 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup>; thus, if the global mean forcing is -0.3 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, then 
  the 2/3 uncertainty range of estimated global mean forcing is -0.1 to -0.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. 
  The main uncertainties are the single scattering albedo, the upscatter fraction, 
  and the burden.<br>
</p>
<p> Several assumptions are implicit in the above approach. First, there is a 
  specific assumption concerning the determination of the single scattering albedo 
  at 80% RH since most measurements of this parameter are for low (dry) RH. Second, 
  it was assumed that the specific aerosol absorption did not change with humidification 
  while that of light scattering followed f(RH). While reasonable at this time, 
  this issue needs further investigation. Another assumption implicit in the formula 
  for planetary albedo change is that both absorption and scattering by aerosols 
  are not significant compared to cloud effects when clouds are present. As Haywood 
  and Ramaswamy (1998) have pointed out, this assumption is reasonable for scattering 
  aerosols but not for strongly absorbing aerosols. The overall effect of including 
  the effects of absorbing aerosols in the presence of clouds would be to reduce 
  the net forcing relative to that calculated here. Turning to other issues, only 
  second order terms were used in the Taylor expansion. While certainly valid 
  for cases in which the uncertainties in the independent parameters do not exceed 
  20% of the central values, this neglect becomes somewhat problematic for larger 
  uncertainties. Since there are several variables whose uncertainties are of 
  the order of 50%, an assessment was made of possible underestimation of error 
  by full functional evaluation, i.e., a population of values for the forcing 
  function was generated from the population of the most uncertain variables (all 
  other variables held constant) and the variance in the forcing function generated 
  in this way compared with that derived from Taylor expansion. It was found that 
  the error in variance propagation was second order (&lt;10%) and has therefore 
  been neglected here. Finally, there is an implicit assumption that all of the 
  variables are normally distributed.<br>
</p>
<p> There are, of course, several sources of uncertainty that can not be evaluated 
  using this approach. For example, uncertainties associated with the vertical 
  distribution of the aerosol and with potential correlations between clouds and 
  aerosol abundances are not evaluated. Furthermore, uncertainties associated 
  with the radiative transfer treatment (which might be of order 20% (Boucher 
  et al., 1998)) are neglected. A further caveat is that the uncertainty estimates 
  of <a href="192.htm#tab59a">Table 5.9</a> depend on the assumption that the 
  data chosen for the size distribution are representative throughout those areas 
  where these aerosol types contribute to forcing. Because we used observations 
  from continental polluted regions for fossil fuel aerosols and from regional 
  measurements for biomass aerosols, they may not encompass the full set of size 
  distributions that may occur in regions outside of those where these measurements 
  are valid.</p>
