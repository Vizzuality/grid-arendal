<p>It is very important to compare trends in the various indicators to see if 
  a physically consistent picture emerges, as this will critically affect the 
  final assessment of our confidence in any such changes. A number of qualitative 
  consistencies among the various indicators of climate change have increased 
  our confidence in our analyses of the historical climate record: <a href="#fig239a">Figure 
  2.39a</a> and <a href="#fig239b">b</a> summarises the changes in various 
  temperature and hydrological indicators, respectively, and provides a measure 
  of confidence about each change. Of particular relevance are the changes identified 
  below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Temperature over the global land and oceans, with two estimates for the 
    latter, are measured and adjusted independently, yet all three show quite 
    consistent increasing trends (0.52 to 0.61&deg;C/century) over the 20th century. 
  </li>
  <li>The nearly worldwide decrease in mountain glacier extent and mass is consistent 
    with 20th century global temperature increases. A few recent exceptions in 
    maritime areas have been affected by atmospheric circulation variations and 
    related precipitation increases.</li>
  <li>Though less certain, substantial proxy evidence points to the exceptional 
    warmth of the late 20th century relative to the last 1,000 years. The 1990s 
    are likely to have been the warmest decade of the past 1,000 years over the 
    Northern Hemisphere as a whole.</li>
  <li>Satellite and balloon measurements agree that lower-tropo-spheric temperatures 
    have increased only slightly since 1979, though there has been a faster rate 
    of global surface temp-erature increase. Balloon measurements indicate a larger 
    lower-tropospheric temperature increase since 1958, similar to that shown 
    by global surface temperature measurements over the same period. Balloon and 
    satellite measurements agree that lower-stratospheric temperatures have declined 
    significantly since 1979. </li>
  <li>Since 1979, trends in worldwide land-surface air temperature derived from 
    weather stations in the Northern Hemisphere, in regions where urbanisation 
    is likely to have been strong, agree closely with satellite derived temperature 
    trends in the lower troposphere above the same regions. This suggests that 
    urban heat island biases have not significantly affected surface temperature 
    over the period.</li>
  <li>The decrease in the continental diurnal temperature range since around 1950 
    coincides with increases in cloud amount and, at least since the mid-1970s 
    in the Northern Hemisphere, increases in water vapour. </li>
  <li>Decreases in spring snow cover extent since the 1960s, and in the duration 
    of lake and river ice over at least the last century, relate well to increases 
    in Northern Hemispheric surface air temperatures. </li>
  <li>The systematic decrease in spring and summer Arctic sea-ice extent in recent 
    decades is broadly consistent with increases of temperature over most of the 
    adjacent land and ocean. The large reduction in the thickness of summer and 
    early autumn Arctic sea ice over the last thirty to forty years is consistent 
    with this decrease in spatial extent, but we are unsure to what extent poor 
    temporal sampling and multi-decadal variability are affecting the conclusions.</li>
  <li>The increases in lower-tropospheric water vapour and temperature since the 
    mid-1970s are qualitatively consistent with an enhanced hydrological cycle. 
    This is in turn consistent with a greater fraction of precipitation being 
    delivered from extreme and heavy precipitation events, primarily in areas 
    with increasing precipitation, e.g., mid- and high latitudes of the Northern 
    Hemisphere. </li>
  <li>Where data are available, changes in precipitation generally correspond 
    with consistent changes in streamflow and soil moisture.</li>
</ul>
<p>We conclude that the variations and trends of the examined indicators consistently 
  and very strongly support an increasing global surface temperature over at least 
  the last century, although substantial shorter-term global and regional deviations 
  from this warming trend are very likely to have occurred.</p>
