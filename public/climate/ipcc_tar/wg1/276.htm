<h3>7.2.3 Precipitation </h3>
<p>Precipitation drives the continental hydrology, and influences the salinity 
  of the ocean. The distribution of the precipitation in space and time, is therefore 
  of key importance. The amount of precipitation also constitutes a measure of 
  the latent heat release within the atmosphere. The long-term global mean precipitation 
  of 984 mm/yr implies a vertically integrated mean heating rate of 78 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (Arkin 
  and Xie, 1994; Kiehl and Trenberth, 1997). The local precipitation rate on horizontal 
  spatial scales of 1 to 10 km are 10 to 1,000 times the global number so that 
  the associated heating rates often dominate all other effects and strongly influence 
  local and global circulations. Precipitation also acts to remove and transport 
  aerosols and soluble gases both within and below clouds, and thus strongly affects 
  the chemical composition and aerosol distribution. The suspended and precipitating 
  condensates provide sites for aqueous and surface chemical reactions. </p>
<p> The highly variable rain rates and enormous spatial variability makes determination 
  of mean precipitation difficult, let alone how it will change as the climate 
  changes. For instance, a detailed examination of spatial structure of daily 
  precipitation amounts by Osborn and Hulme (1997) shows that in Europe the average 
  separation distance between climate stations where the correlation falls to 
  0.5 is about 150 km in summer and 200 km in winter. This complexity makes it 
  difficult to model precipitation reliably, as many of the processes of importance 
  cannot be resolved by the model grid (typically 200 km) and so sub-grid scale 
  processes have to be parametrized. </p>
<h4><a name="7231"></a>7.2.3.1 Precipitation processes </h4>
<p>Precipitation is usually considered to be of stratiform or convective nature, 
  or a mixture of the two. In stratiform precipitation the vertical velocity of 
  air, usually forced by developing low pressure systems, monsoonal circulations, 
  or underlying orography, is comparable to or smaller than the fall speed of 
  snow and ice crystals. Stratiform precipitation dominates in the extra-tropics 
  except over continents in summer, and there is substantial spatial coherency 
  on scales up to and beyond about 100 km. In contrast, convective precipitation 
  systems are associated with vigorous latent-heat-driven vertical circulations 
  on horizontal scales of a few kilometres. Convection is responsible for most 
  of the precipitation in the tropics and middle latitude continents in summer. 
  In many cases, convective and stratiform precipitation interact or occur together, 
  for instance as convective cells are embedded within areas of stratiform precipitation.</p>
<h4><a name="7232"></a>7.2.3.2 Precipitation modelling</h4>
<p>There is increasing evidence that the use of one or more prognostic cloud water 
  variables for the modelling of stratiform precipitation is fairly successful 
  in simulating continental and sub-continental scale precipitation distributions, 
  including orographic precipitation, provided the synoptic-scale circulation 
  is properly accounted for. This is the case for numerical weather predictions 
  in the short-term range of 1 to 2 days (Petroliagis et al., 1996), and regional 
  climate models driven by observed lateral boundary conditions (e.g., Jones et 
  al., 1995; L&uuml;thi et al., 1996; Christensen et al., 1998; Giorgi et al., 
  1998). Cloud schemes that include an explicit cloud water variable and some 
  parametrization of the ice phase (either by carrying an explicit cloud ice variable 
  or by including a temperature-dependent formulation of microphysical conversion 
  rates) appear able to credibly reproduce some of the major features of the observed 
  intensity-frequency relations (Frei et al., 1998; Murphy, 1999). </p>
<p> In contrast, the simulation of convective precipitation, which is fully parametrized, 
  is of substantially poorer quality over continental regions. In a recent intercomparison 
  study that attempted to simulate dry and wet summers over the continental US, 
  large inter-model and model-observation differences were found (Takle et al., 
  1999), although the larger-scale atmospheric circulation was prescribed. One 
  specific difficulty is the strong diurnal cycle of convective precipitation 
  over land, which is accompanied by the build-up of a well-mixed boundary layer 
  in response to solar heating prior to the onset of convection. Recent studies 
  (Yang and Slingo, 1998; Dai et al., 1999) find that moist convection schemes 
  tend to initiate convection prematurely as compared with the real world, and 
  instability does not build up adequately. Premature cloud formation prevents 
  the correct solar heating from occurring, impacting the development of the well-mixed 
  boundary layer and continental-scale convergence at the surface, which in turn 
  affects the triggering of convection. Scale interactions between convection 
  that is organised by somewhat larger scales also seem to underlie the difficulties 
  all GCMs have in simulating the Madden-Julian Oscillation of intra-seasonal 
  variations in the deep tropics (Slingo et al., 1996).</p>
<h4><a name="7233"></a>7.2.3.3 The temperature-moisture feedback and implications 
  for precipitation and extremes</h4>
<p>With increasing temperature, the surface energy budget tends to become increasingly 
  dominated by evaporation, owing to the increase in the water holding capacity 
  of the boundary layer. The increase of evaporation is not strictly inevitable 
  (Pierrehumbert, 1999), but it occurs in all general circulation models, though 
  with varying strength. Simulated evapotranspiration and net atmospheric moisture 
  content is also found to increase (Del Genio et al., 1991; Trenberth, 1998), 
  as is observed to be happening in many places (Hense et al., 1988; Gaffen et 
  al., 1992; Ross and Elliot, 1996; Zhai and Eskridge, 1997). Globally there must 
  be an increase in precipitation to balance the enhanced evaporation but the 
  processes by which precipitation is altered locally are not well understood. 
  Over land, enhanced evaporation can occur only to the extent that there is sufficient 
  soil moisture in the unperturbed state. Naturally occurring droughts are likely 
  to be exacerbated by enhanced potential evapotranspiration, which quickly robs 
  soil of its moisture. </p>
<p> Because moisture convergence is likely to be proportionately enhanced as the 
  moisture content increases, it should lead to similarly enhanced precipitation 
  rates. Moreover, the latent heat released feeds back on the intensity of the 
  storms. These factors suggest that, while global precipitation exhibits a small 
  increase with modest surface warming, it becomes increasingly concentrated in 
  intense events, as is observed to be happening in many parts of the world (Karl 
  et al., 1995), including the USA (Karl and Knight, 1998), Japan (Iwashima and 
  Yamamoto, 1993) and Australia (Suppiah and Hennessy, 1998), thus increasing 
  risk of flooding. However, the overall changes in precipitation must equal evaporation 
  changes, and this is smaller percentage-wise than the typical change in moisture 
  content in most model simulations (e.g., Mitchell et al., 1987; Roads et al., 
  1996). Thus there are implications for the frequency of storms or other factors 
  (duration, efficiency, etc.) that must come into play to restrict the total 
  precipitation. One possibility is that individual storms could be more intense 
  from the latent heat enhancement, but are fewer and farther between (Trenberth, 
  1998, 1999). </p>
<p> These aspects have been explored only to a limited extent in climate models. 
  No studies deal with true intensity of rainfall, which requires hourly (or higher 
  resolution) data, and the analysis is typically of daily rainfall amounts. Increases 
  in rain intensity and dry periods are simulated along with a general decrease 
  in the probability of moderate precipitation events (Whetton et al., 1993; Cubasch 
  et al., 1995; Gregory and Mitchell, 1995; Mearns et al., 1995; Jones et al., 
  1997; Zwiers and Kharin, 1998; McGuffie et al., 1999). For a given precipitation 
  intensity of 20 to 40 mm/day, the return periods become shorter by a factor 
  of 2 to 5 (Hennessy et al., 1997). This effect increases with the strength of 
  the event (Fowler and Hennessy, 1995; Frei et al., 1998). However, estimates 
  of precipitation and surface long-wave radiation suggest that the sensitivity 
  of the hydrological cycle in climate models to changes in SST may be systematically 
  too weak (Soden, 2000). Accordingly, it is important that much more attention 
  should be devoted to precipitation rates and frequency, and the physical processes 
  which govern these quantities. </p>
