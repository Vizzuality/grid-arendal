<h2>8.10 Sources of Uncertainty and Levels of Confidence in Coupled Models </h2>
<h3><a name="8101"></a>8.10.1 Uncertainties in Evaluating Coupled Models</h3>
<p>Our attempts to evaluate coupled models have been limited by the lack of a 
  more comprehensive and systematic approach to the collection and analysis of 
  model output from well co-ordinated and well designed experiments. Important 
  gaps still remain in our ability to evaluate the natural variability of models 
  over the last several centuries. There are gaps in the specification of the 
  radiative forcing (especially the vertical profile) as well as gaps in proxy 
  palaeo-data necessary for the production of long time series of important variables 
  such as surface air temperature and precipitation.</p>
<p>In order to assist future coupled model evaluation exercises, we would strongly 
  encourage substantially expanded international programmes of systematic evaluation 
  and intercomparison of coupled models under standardised experimental conditions. 
  Such programmes should include a much more comprehensive and systematic system 
  of model analysis and diagnosis, and a Monte Carlo approach to model uncertainties 
  associated with parametrizations and initial conditions. The computing power 
  now available to most major modelling centres is such that an ambitious programme 
  that explores the differing direct responses of parametrizations (as well as 
  some indirect effects) is now quite feasible.</p>
<p>Further systematic and co-ordinated intercomparison of the impact of physical 
  parametrizations both on the ability to simulate the present climate (and its 
  variability) and on the transient climate response (and its variability) is 
  urgently needed. </p>
<p>The systematic analysis of extremes in coupled models remains considerably 
  underdeveloped. Use of systematic analysis techniques would greatly assist future 
  assessments.</p>
<p>It is important that in future model intercomparison projects the experimental 
  design and data management takes heed of the detailed requirements of diagnosticians 
  and the impacts community to ensure the widest possible participation in analysing 
  the performance of coupled models.</p>
<h3><a name="8102"></a>8.10.2 Levels of Confidence</h3>
<p>We have chosen to use the following process in assigning confidence to our 
  assessment statements; the level of confidence we place in a particular finding 
  reflects both the degree of consensus amongst modellers and the quantity of 
  evidence that is available to support the finding. We prefer to use a qualitative 
  three-level classification system following a proposal by Moss and Schneider 
  (1999), where a finding can be considered:</p>
<p><i>"well established"</i> - nearly all models behave the same way; 
  observations are consistent with nearly all models; systematic experiments conducted 
  with many models support the finding;<br>
  <i>"evolving"</i> - some models support the finding; different models 
  account for different aspects of the observations; different aspects of key 
  processes can be invoked to support the finding; limited experiments with some 
  models support the finding; parametrizations supporting the finding are incompletely 
  tested;<br>
  <i>"speculative"</i> - conceptually plausible idea that has only been 
  tried in one model or has very large uncertainties associated with it.</p>
<h3><a name="8103"></a>8.10.3 Assessment</h3>
<p>In this chapter, we have evaluated a number of climate models of the types 
  used in <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>. The information we have collected 
  gives an indication of the capability of coupled models in general and some 
  details of how individual coupled models have performed. </p>
<p><i>We regard the following as "well established":</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Incremental improvements in the performance of coupled models have occurred 
    since the SAR, resulting from advances in the modelling of the oceans, atmosphere 
    and land surface, as well as improvements in the coupling of these components.</li>
  <li>Coupled models can provide credible simulations of both the annual mean 
    climate and the climatological seasonal cycle over broad continental scales 
    for most variables of interest for climate change. Clouds and humidity remain 
    sources of significant uncertainty but there have been incremental improvements 
    in simulations of these quantities.</li>
  <li>Some non-flux adjusted models are now able to maintain stable climatologies 
    of comparable quality to flux adjusted models. </li>
  <li>There is no systematic difference between flux adjusted and non-flux adjusted 
    models in the simulation of internal climate variability. This supports the 
    use of both types of model in detection and attribution of climate change.</li>
  <li>Several coupled models are able to reproduce the major trend in surface 
    air temperature, when driven by radiative forcing scenarios corresponding 
    to the 20th century. However, in these studies only idealised scenarios of 
    only sulphate radiative forcing have been used.</li>
  <li>Many atmospheric models are able to simulate an increase of the African 
    summer monsoon in response to insolation forcing for the Holocene but they 
    all underestimate this increase if vegetation feedbacks are ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>We regard the following as "evolving":</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Coupled model simulation of phenomena such as monsoons and the NAO has improved 
    since the SAR. </li>
  <li>Analysis of, and confidence in, extreme events simulated within climate 
    models is emerging, particularly for storm tracks and storm frequency.</li>
  <li>The performance of coupled models in simulating ENSO has improved; however, 
    the region of maximum SST variability is displaced westward and its strength 
    is generally underestimated. When suitably initialised, some coupled models 
    have had a degree of success in predicting ENSO events. </li>
  <li>Models tend to underestimate natural climate variability derived from proxy 
    data over the last few centuries. This may be due to missing forcings, but 
    this needs to be explored more systematically, with a wider range of more 
    recent models.</li>
  <li>A reasonable simulation of a limited set of past climate states (over the 
    past 20,000 years) has been achieved using a range of climate models, enhancing 
    our confidence in using models to simulate climates different from the present 
    day.</li>
  <li>Our ability to increase confidence in the simulation of land surface quantities 
    in coupled models is limited by the need for significant advances in the simulation 
    of snow, liquid and frozen soil moisture (and their associated water and energy 
    fluxes).</li>
  <li>Coupled model simulations of the palaeo-monsoons produce better agreement 
    with proxy palaeo-data when vegetation feedbacks are taken into account; this 
    suggests that vegetation changes, both natural and anthropogenic, may need 
    to be incorporated into coupled models used for climate projections.</li>
  <li>Models have some skill in simulating ocean ventilation rates, which are 
    important in transient ocean heat uptake. However these processes are sensitive 
    to choice of ocean mixing parametrizations. </li>
  <li>Some coupled models now include improved sea-ice components, but they do 
    not yield systematic improvements in the sea-ice distributions. This may reflect 
    the impact of errors in the simulated near surface wind fields, which offsets 
    any improvement due to including sea-ice motion.</li>
  <li>Some coupled models produce good simulations of the large-scale heat transport 
    in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. This appears to be an important factor 
    in achieving good model climatology without flux adjustment.</li>
  <li>The relative importance of increased resolution in coupled models remains 
    to be evaluated systematically but many models show benefits from increased 
    resolution. </li>
  <li>Our ability to make firmer statements regarding the minimum resolution (both 
    horizontal and vertical) required in the components of coupled models is limited 
    by the lack of systematic modelling studies.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>We regard the following as "speculative":</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Tropical vortices with some of the characteristics of "tropical cyclones" 
    may be simulated in high resolution atmospheric models but not yet in coupled 
    climate models. Considerable debate remains over their detailed interpretation 
    and behaviour.</li>
  <li>Some modelling studies suggest that adding forcings such as solar variability 
    and volcanic aerosols to greenhouse gases and the direct sulphate aerosol 
    effect improves the simulation of climate variability of the 20th century.</li>
  <li>Emerging modelling studies that add the indirect effect of aerosols and 
    of ozone changes to greenhouse gases and the direct sulphate aerosol effect 
    suggest that the direct aerosol effect may previously have been overestimated.</li>
  <li>Lack of knowledge of the vertical distribution of radiative forcing (especially 
    aerosol and ozone) is contributing to the discrepancies between models and 
    observations of the surface-troposphere temperature record. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Our overall assessment</i><br>
  Coupled models have evolved and improved significantly since the SAR. In general, 
  they provide credible simulations of climate, at least down to sub-continental 
  scales and over temporal scales from seasonal to decadal. The varying sets of 
  strengths and weaknesses that models display lead us to conclude that no single 
  model can be considered "best" and it is important to utilise results 
  from a range of coupled models. We consider coupled models, as a class, to be 
  suitable tools to provide useful projections of future climates.</p>
