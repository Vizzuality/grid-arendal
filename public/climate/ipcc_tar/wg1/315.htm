<p><a name="fig81"></a>In this chapter, we assess climate models on the basis 
  of their ability to simulate present and past climates. What it means to simulate 
  a particular climate state is linked to the question of model initialisation. 
  Ideally, given a "perfect model", and "perfect knowledge" 
  of the present climate state, one could simply initialise a climate model with 
  the present state. Then, given perpetual present day forcing (from trace substances 
  and solar radiation), one might expect the model to remain close to the present 
  state, perhaps with some level of variability. However, in practice, this ideal 
  is not achieved and a model initialised in this way adjusts from the initial 
  state. This adjustment has been characterised by two time-scales (Bryan, 1998): 
  in the initial "fast" adjustment, the atmosphere, land surface, ocean 
  mixed layer and sea ice reach a state of near equilibrium, typically taking 
  5 to 50 years. Surface temperature error patterns (e.g., <a href="#fig81">Figure 
  8.1a</a>) are generally established on this time-scale, and persist over many 
  centuries of integration, but there typically remain slight imbalances in the 
  surface heat and fresh water fluxes. These imbalances drive a second, slower, 
  adjustment phase (often called "climate drift") which takes place 
  over centuries to millennia and involves adjustment of the deep ocean to the 
  surface imbalances. This "climate drift" can make interpretation of 
  transient climate change simulations difficult, so models are generally allowed 
  to adjust to a state where such drifts have become acceptably slow, before starting 
  climate change simulations. A number of techniques have been used to achieve 
  this (see Stouffer and Dixon, 1998), but it is not possible, in general, to 
  say which of these procedures gives "better" initial conditions for 
  a climate change projection run.</p>
<p>A number of model runs have now been made which are forced by the historical 
  record of natural and anthropogenic forcing from the mid-19th century to the 
  present. As well as avoiding the "cold start" problem in climate projections 
  (SAR Chapter 6, Section 6.2.4 and <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>), these runs 
  can be compared against historical observations and form a valuable model evaluation 
  tool (<a href="326.htm#861">Section 8.6.1</a>).</p>
<h3><a name="842"></a>8.4.2 Flux Adjustment and Energy Transports</h3>
<p>Given present day greenhouse gas concentrations, most coupled models at the 
  time of the SAR had difficulty in obtaining a stable climate near to the present 
  day state. Therefore "flux adjustment" terms were often added to the 
  surface fluxes of heat, water and (sometimes) momentum which were passed from 
  the atmosphere to the ocean model. Flux adjustments are non-physical in that 
  they cannot be related to any physical process in the climate system and do 
  not a priori conserve heat and water across the atmosphere-ocean interface. 
  The flux adjustments were specifically chosen to give a stable and realistic 
  simulation of present surface climate (especially the sea surface temperature 
  and sea-ice cover), and were often as large as the annual mean model fluxes 
  themselves. The need to use such adjustments was clearly a source of uncertainty: 
  the approach inherently disguises sources of systematic error in the models, 
  and may distort their sensitivity to changed radiative forcing. Models which 
  did not use flux adjustment produced unrealistic simulations of fundamental 
  aspects of the climate system such as the strength of the North Atlantic thermohaline 
  circulation (SAR Chapter 5, Table 5.5).</p>
<p>Recently a number of coupled models have emerged with greatly improved surface 
  climatologies without using flux adjustments. <a href="#fig81">Figure 8.1a</a> 
  shows SST errors from one such model, about 100 years after initialisation. 
  Errors are generally less than 2&deg;C, and the error pattern shown is stable 
  over several centuries of integration. However some larger errors are seen, 
  in particular a cooling in the North Pacific, a warming in the eastern tropical 
  ocean basins (probably due to a lack of stratocumulus cloud there), and a warming 
  in the southern ocean. These errors appear to be common to a number of more 
  recent non-flux adjusted models (Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grand Echelle/Oc&eacute;an 
  Parall&eacute;lis&eacute; (ARPEGE/OPA1), Guilyardi and Madec 1997; Climate System 
  Model (CSM 1.0), Boville and Gent 1998; Hadley Centre Coupled Model (HadCM3), 
  Gordon et al., 2000), but other models show different error patterns (ARPEGE/OPA2, 
  Institut Pierre Simon Laplace/Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean-Vegetation Model (IPSL-CM2), 
  Barthelet et al., 1998a,b). The surface climatologies in several non-flux adjusted 
  models are now considered good enough and stable enough to use those models 
  for climate change projections. Typical flux adjusted models do show smaller 
  SST errors, because the flux adjustments are chosen specifically to minimise 
  those errors (<a href="#fig81">Figure 8.1b</a>). For comparison, <a href="#fig81">Figure 
  8.1c</a> shows the SST errors when the older, flux adjusted model was run in 
  non-flux adjusted mode.</p>
<p>It appears that the success of the recent models which do not require heat 
  flux adjustments is related to an improved ability to simulate the large-scale 
  heat balances described in <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a> (Weaver and Hughes, 
  1996; Guilyardi and Madec, 1997; Johns et al., 1997; Bryan, 1998; Gordon et 
  al., 2000). Improvements to both atmospheric (Section <a href="318.htm">8.5.1.2.2</a>) 
  and oceanic (<a href="320.htm">Section 8.5.2.2</a>) components of the models 
  have played a part in this advance. Such models have the advantage over flux-adjusted 
  models that, provided the large-scale balances are obtained using a physically 
  justifiable choice of model parameters, these models are physically self-consistent 
  representations of the climate system. However, in some cases only very loose 
  physical constraints can be placed on the model parameters.</p>
<p>The fresh water budget is more complex than the heat budget because of the 
  effects of land surface processes, rivers and sea ice. Water budget errors are 
  potentially far reaching because there is no direct feedback between surface 
  salinity errors and the surface fresh water flux, for example, persistent freshening 
  at high latitudes could lead to a collapse of the ocean thermohaline circulation 
  (Manabe and Stouffer, 1997; see also <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="300.htm">Section 
  7.6.2</a>). Some aspects of the large-scale hydrological cycle are subject to 
  large observational uncertainty (Wijffels et al., 1992), and this has inhibited 
  evaluation and improvements in the water budget. Nonetheless, some models are 
  now able to produce stable multi-century runs without water flux adjustments.</p>
<h4><a name="8421"></a>8.4.2.1 Does the use of flux adjustments in a model have 
  a significant impact on climate change projections? </h4>
<p>Marotzke and Stone (1995) show that using flux adjustment to correct surface 
  errors in the control climate does not necessarily correct errors in processes 
  which control the climate change response. Flux adjustments can also result 
  in spurious multiple equilibrium states of the tropical (Neelin and Dijkstra, 
  1995) and thermohaline (Dijkstra and Neelin, 1999) ocean circulation. On the 
  other hand, a good representation of, say, sea-ice extent may be important to 
  produce the correct magnitude of ice-albedo feedback under climate change, and 
  it may be preferable to use flux adjustments to give a good sea-ice distribution 
  than to omit the flux adjustments but to have a poorer sea-ice extent. Overall, 
  differences have been seen in the climate change response of flux adjusted and 
  equivalent non-flux adjusted models (Fanning and Weaver, 1997b; Gregory and 
  Mitchell, 1997), but it is not clear whether the differences are due to the 
  flux adjustment itself, or to the systematic errors in the non-flux adjusted 
  model. The only practical way to resolve this issue may be to continue the progress 
  which has been made towards models which achieve good surface climatology without 
  flux adjustment, whereupon the effect of flux adjustments will cease to be of 
  concern. </p>
