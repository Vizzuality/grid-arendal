<h3>3.7.4 Conclusions </h3>
<p>The differences among the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations projected with the various SRES 
  scenarios considered are larger than the differences caused by inclusion or 
  omission of climate-mediated feedbacks. The range of uptake rates projected 
  by process-based models for any one scenario is, however, considerable, due 
  to uncertainties about (especially) terrestrial ecosystem responses to high 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, which have not yet been resolved experimentally, and uncertainties 
  about the response of global NPP to changes in climate (Cramer et al., 1999). 
  A smaller feedback would be implied if, as some models indicate, global NPP 
  increases with warming throughout the relevant range of climates and no forest 
  die back occurs. Larger positive feedbacks would be implied if regional drying 
  caused partial die back of tropical forests, as some of the DGVMs in Cramer 
  et al. (2001), and one coupled climate-carbon model study of Cox et al. (2000), 
  suggest; however, another coupled climate-carbon model study (Friedlingstein 
  et al., 2001) suggests a smaller feedback. Uncertainty also arises due to differences 
  in the climate responses of ocean models, especially as regards the extent and 
  effects (biological as well as physical) of increased stratification in a warmer 
  climate (Joos et al., 1999b).</p>
<p>In conclusion, anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are virtually certain to be the 
  dominant factor determining CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations throughout the 21st century. 
  The importance of anthropogenic emissions is underlined by the expectation that 
  the proportion of emissions taken up by both ocean and land will decline at 
  high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (even if absolute uptake by the ocean continues 
  to rise). There is considerable uncertainty in projections of future CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, 
  because of uncertainty about the effects of climate change on the processes 
  determining ocean and land uptake of CO<sub>2</sub>. These uncertainties do not negate 
  the main finding that anthropogenic emissions will be the main control.</p>
<p>Large-scale manipulations of terrestrial ecosystems have been proposed as a 
  means of slowing the increase of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during the 21st 
  century in support of the aims of the Kyoto Protocol (Tans and Wallace, 1999; 
  IPCC, 2000a). Based on current understanding of land use in the carbon cycle, 
  the impacts of future land use on terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere exchanges 
  have the potential to modify atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on this 
  time-scale. Direct effects of land-use changes are thought to represent about 
  10 to 30% of total anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (<a href="097.htm#tab31">Table 
  3.1</a>), so there is scope for either intended or unintended changes in land 
  use to reduce or increase total anthropogenic emissions. But the possibilities 
  for enhancing natural sinks have to be placed in perspective: a rough upper 
  bound for the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration that could be achieved 
  by enhancing terrestrial carbon uptake through land-use change over the coming 
  century is 40 to 70 ppm (<a href="100.htm">Section 3.2.2.2</a>), to be considered 
  against a two to four times larger potential for increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentraion 
  by deforestation, and a &gt;400 ppm range among the SRES scenarios (<a href="123.htm#fig312">Figure 
  3.12</a>).</p>
