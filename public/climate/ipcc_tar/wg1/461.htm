<h4>12.4.3.2 Optimal detection studies that use multiple fixed signal patterns</h4>
<p><i>Surface temperature patterns</i><br>
  Hegerl et al. (1997) applied a two-fingerprint approach, using a greenhouse 
  gas fingerprint and an additional sulphate aerosol fingerprint that is made 
  spatially independent (orthogonalised) of the greenhouse fingerprint. They analysed 
  50-year trends in observed northern summer temperatures. The influence of greenhouse 
  gas and sulphate aerosol signals were both detected simultaneously in the observed 
  pattern of 50-year temperature trends, and the amplitudes of both signals were 
  found to be consistent between model and observations. Simulations forced with 
  greenhouse gases alone and solar irradiance changes alone were not consistent 
  with observations. </p>
<p>Hegerl et al. (2000) repeated this analysis using parallel simulations from 
  a different climate model. The combined effect of greenhouse gases and aerosols 
  was still detectable and consistent with observations, but the separate influence 
  of sulphate aerosol forcing, as simulated by this second model, was not detectable. 
  This was because the sulphate response was weaker in the second model, and closely 
  resembled one of the main modes of natural variability. Hence, the detection 
  of the net anthropogenic signal is robust, but the detection of the sulphate 
  aerosol component is very sensitive to differences in model-simulated responses. 
</p>
<p>As in the single-pattern case, this study has been extended to include seven 
  model GS simulations and to take into account observational sampling error (<a href="460.htm#fig1210">Figure 
  12.10b,c</a>, see also Barnett et al., 1999; Hegerl et al. 2001). A simple linear 
  transformation allows results to be displayed in terms of individual greenhouse 
  and sulphate signal amplitudes, which assists comparison with other results 
  (see <a href="460.htm#fig1210">Figure 12.10</a>; Hegerl and Allen, 2000). The 
  amplitudes of the greenhouse gas and sulphate components are simultaneously 
  consistent with the observed amplitudes in 10 of the fourteen GS cases (seven 
  models for two sets of fingerprints) displayed. This contrasts with eleven out 
  of fourteen in the combined amplitude test described in <a href="460.htm#12431">Section 
  12.4.3.1</a>. If the trends to 1995 are used (<a href="460.htm#fig1210">Figure 
  12.10c</a>), the results are similar, though in this case, the ellipse just 
  includes the origin and six out of the fourteen GS cases are consistent with 
  observations. The inconsistency can be seen to be mainly due to large variations 
  in the amplitudes of the model-simulated responses to sulphate aerosols (indicated 
  by the vertical spread of results). Model-simulated responses to greenhouse 
  gases are generally more consistent both with each other and with observations. 
  Two of the cases of disagreement are based on a single simulation rather than 
  an ensemble mean and should therefore be viewed with caution (see Barnett et 
  al., 2000). Barnett et al. (1999) found that the degree of agreement between 
  the five models and observations they considered was similar, whether or not 
  the global mean response was removed from the patterns. Signal amplitudes from 
  simulations with greenhouse gas forcing only are generally inconsistent with 
  those estimated from observations (<a href="460.htm#fig1210">Figure 12.10b,c</a>).</p>
<p>In most of the cases presented here, the response to natural forcings was neglected. 
  In a similar analysis to that just described, Hegerl et al. (2000); see also 
  Barnett et al., 1999) also assessed simulations of the response to volcanic 
  and solar forcing. They find, in agreement with Tett et al. (1999), that there 
  is better agreement between observations and simulations when these natural 
  forcings are included, particularly in the early 20th century, but that natural 
  forcings alone cannot account for the late-century warming. </p>
<p>In summary, the estimation of the contribution of individual factors to recent 
  climate change is highly model dependent, primarily due to uncertainties in 
  the forcing and response due to sulphate aerosols. However, although the estimated 
  amplitude varies from study to study, all studies indicate a substantial contribution 
  from anthropogenic greenhouse gases to the changes observed over the latter 
  half of the 20th century. </p>
<p><i>Vertical patterns of temperature</i><br>
  Allen and Tett (1999) also used spatial fingerprints in the vertical derived 
  from simulations with greenhouse gas forcing alone and simulations with greenhouse 
  gas, sulphate aerosol and strato-spheric ozone forcing. These authors show that, 
  even if both greenhouse and other anthropogenic signals are estimated simultaneously 
  in the observed record, a significant response to greenhouse gases remains detectable. 
  Hill et al. (2001) extended this analysis to include model-simulated responses 
  to both solar and volcanic forcing, and again found that the response to greenhouse 
  gases remains detectable. Results with non-optimised fingerprints are consistent 
  with the optimised case, but the uncertainty range is larger. </p>
<p>In summary, the fixed pattern studies indicate that the recent warming is unlikely 
  (bordering on very unlikely) to be due to internal climate variability. A substantial 
  response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases appears to be necessary to account 
  for recent temperature trends but the majority of studies indicate that greenhouse 
  gases alone do not appear to be able to provide a full explanation. Inclusion 
  of the response to the direct effect of sulphate aerosols usually leads to a 
  more satisfactory explanation of the observed changes, although the amplitude 
  of the sulphate signal depends on the model used. These studies also provide 
  some evidence that solar variations may have contributed to the early century 
  warming.</p>
