<h2><a name="32"></a>3.2 Terrestrial and Ocean Biogeochemistry: Update on Processes 
</h2>
<h3><a name="321"></a>3.2.1 Overview of the Carbon Cycle</h3>
<p>The first panel of <a href="097.htm#fig31">Figure 3.1</a> shows the major components 
  of the carbon cycle, estimates of the current storage in the active compartments, 
  and estimates of the gross fluxes between compartments. The second panel shows 
  best estimates of the additional flux (release to the atmosphere - positive; 
  uptake - negative) associated with the human perturbation of the carbon 
  cycle during the 1980s. Note that the gross amounts of carbon annually exchanged 
  between the ocean and atmosphere, and between the land and atmosphere, represent 
  a sizeable fraction of the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> content - and are 
  many times larger than the total anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> input. In consequence, 
  an imbalance in these exchanges could easily lead to an anomaly of comparable 
  magnitude to the direct anthropogenic perturbation. This implies that it is 
  important to consider how these fluxes may be changing in response to human 
  activities.<br>
  <br>
  To understand how the changing global environment may alter the carbon cycle, 
  it is necessary to further analyse the fluxes and examine the physicochemical 
  and biological processes that determine them. The remaining two panels of Figure 
  3.1 indicate the main constituent fluxes in the terrestrial and marine systems, 
  with current estimates of their magnitude. The following sections explain the 
  controls on these fluxes, with special reference to processes by which anthropogenic 
  changes may influence the overall carbon balance of the land and oceans on time-scales 
  from years to centuries.</p>

        fluxes. </b> </div>
      <p>Estimating the carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems and accounting 
        for changes in these stocks requires adequate information on land cover, 
        carbon density in vegetation and soils, and the fate of carbon (burning, 
        removals, decomposition). Accounting for changes in all carbon stocks 
        in all areas would yield the net carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems 
        and the atmosphere (NBP).<br>
        <br>
        Global land cover maps show poor agreement due to different definitions 
        of cover types and inconsistent sources of data (de Fries and Townshend, 
        1994). Land cover changes are difficult to document, uncertainties are 
        large, and historical data are sparse. Satellite imagery is a valuable 
        tool for estimating land cover, despite problems with cloud cover, changes 
        at fine spatial scales, and interpretation (for example, difficulties 
        in distinguishing primary and secondary forest). Aerial photography and 
        ground measurements can be used to validate satellite-based observations.<br>
        <br>
        The carbon density of vegetation and soils has been measured in numerous 
        ecological field studies that have been aggregated to a global scale to 
        assess carbon stocks and NPP (e.g., Atjay et al., 1979; Olson et al., 
        1983; Saugier and Roy, 2001; Table 3.2), although high spatial and temporal 
        heterogeneity and methodological differences introduce large uncertainties. 
        Land inventory studies tend to measure the carbon stocks in vegetation 
        and soils over larger areas and/or longer time periods. For example, the 
        United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) has been compiling 
        forest inventories since 1946 providing detailed data on carbon stocks, 
        often based on commercial wood production data. Inventory studies include 
        managed forests with mixed age stands, thus average carbon stock values 
        are often lower than those based on ecological site studies, which have 
        generally been carried out in relatively undisturbed, mature ecosystems. 
        Fluxes of carbon can be estimated from changes in inventoried carbon stocks 
        (e.g., UN-ECE/FAO, 2000), or from combining data on land-use change with 
        methods to calculate changes in carbon stock (e.g., Houghton, 1999). The 
        greatest uncertainty in both methods is in estimating the fate of the 
        carbon: the fraction which is burned, rates of decomposition, the effect 
        of burning and harvesting on soil carbon, and subsequent land management.<br>
        <br>
        Ecosystem-atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub> exchange on short time-scales can 
        be measured using micrometeorological techniques such as eddy covariance, 
        which relies on rapidly responding sensors mounted on towers to resolve 
        the net flux of CO<sub>2</sub> between a patch of land and the atmosphere 
        (Baldocchi et al., 1988). The annual integral of the measured CO<sub>2</sub> 
        exchange is approximately equivalent to NEP (Wofsy et al., 1993; Goulden 
        et. al, 1996; Aubinet et al., 2000). This innovation has led to the establishment 
        of a rapidly expanding network of long-term monitoring sites (FLUXNET) 
        with many sites now operating for several years, improving the understanding 
        of the physiological and ecological processes that control NEP (e.g., 
        Valentini et al., 2000). The distribution of sites is currently biased 
        toward regrowing forests in the Northern Hemisphere, and there are still 
        technical problems and uncertainties, although these are being tackled. 
        Current flux measurement techniques typically integrate processes at a 
        scale less than 1 km<sup>2</sup>.</p>
