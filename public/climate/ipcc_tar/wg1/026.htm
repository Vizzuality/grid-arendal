<h2>E.4 New Estimates of Responses to Natural Forcing</h2>
<p><i>Assessments based on physical principles and model simulations indicate 
  that natural forcing alone is unlikely to explain the recent observed global 
  warming or the observed changes in vertical temperature structure of the atmosphere.</i> 
  Fully coupled ocean-atmosphere models have used reconstructions of solar and 
  volcanic forcings over the last one to three centuries to estimate the contribution 
  of natural forcing to climate variability and change. Although the reconstruction 
  of natural forcings is uncertain, including their effects produces an increase 
  in variance at longer (multi-decadal) time-scales. This brings the low-frequency 
  variability closer to that deduced from palaeo-reconstructions. It is likely 
  that the net natural forcing (i.e., solar plus volcanic) has been negative over 
  the past two decades, and possibly even the past four decades. Statistical assessments 
  confirm that simulated natural variability, both internal and naturally forced, 
  is unlikely to explain the warming in the latter half of the 20th century (see 
  <a href="#figTechSum15">Figure 15</a>). However, there is evidence for a detectable 
  volcanic influence on climate and evidence that suggests a detectable solar 
  influence, especially in the early part of the 20th century. Even if the models 
  underestimate the magnitude of the response to solar or volcanic forcing, the 
  spatial and temporal patterns are such that these effects alone cannot explain 
  the observed temperature changes over the 20th century.</p>

      <p><b>Figure 15:</b> Global mean surface temperature anomalies relative 
        to the 1880 to 1920 mean from the instrumental record compared with ensembles 
        of four simulations with a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model forced 
        <b>(a)</b> with solar and volcanic forcing only, <b>(b)</b> with anthropogenic 
        forcing including well mixed greenhouse gases, changes in stratospheric 
        and tropospheric ozone and the direct and indirect effects of sulphate 
        aerosols, and <b>(c)</b> with all forcings, both natural and anthropogenic. 
        The thick line shows the instrumental data while the thin lines show the 
        individual model simulations in the ensemble of four members. Note that 
        the data are annual mean values. The model data are only sampled at the 
        locations where there are observations. The changes in sulphate aerosol 
        are calculated interactively, and changes in tropospheric ozone were calculated 
        offline using a chemical transport model. Changes in cloud brightness 
        (the first indirect effect of sulphate aerosols) were calculated by an 
        off line simulation and included in the model. The changes in stratospheric 
        ozone were based on observations. The volcanic and solar forcing were 
        based on published combinations of measured and proxy data. The net anthropogenic 
        forcing at 1990 was 1.0 Wm<sup>-2</sup> including a net cooling of 1.0 
        Wm<sup>-2</sup> due to sulphate aerosols. The net natural forcing for 
        1990 relative to 1860 was 0.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, and for 1992 was a net 
        cooling of 2.0 Wm<sup>-2</sup> due to Mount Pinatubo. Other models forced 
        with anthropogenic forcing give similar results to those shown in (b).

<h2>E.5 Sensitivity to Estimates of Climate Change Signals</h2>
<i>There is a wide range of evidence of qualitative consistencies between observed 
climate changes and model responses to anthropogenic forcing. </i>Models and observations 
show increasing global temperature, increasing land-ocean temperature contrast, 
diminishing sea-ice extent, glacial retreat, and increases in precipitation at 
high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Some qualitative inconsistencies remain, 
including the fact that models predict a faster rate of warming in the mid- to 
upper troposphere than is observed in either satellite or radiosonde tropospheric 
temperature records. <br>
<p><i>All simulations with greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols that have been 
  used in detection studies have found that a significant anthropogenic contribution 
  is required to account for surface and tropospheric trends over at least the 
  last 30 years.</i> Since the SAR, more simulations with increases in greenhouse 
  gases and some representation of aerosol effects have become available. Several 
  studies have included an explicit representation of greenhouse gases (as opposed 
  to an equivalent increase in CO<sub>2</sub>). Some have also included tropospheric 
  ozone changes, an interactive sulphur cycle, an explicit radiative treatment 
  of the scattering of sulphate aerosols, and improved estimates of the changes 
  in stratospheric ozone. Overall, while detection of the climate response to 
  these other anthropogenic factors is often ambiguous, detection of the influence 
  of greenhouse gases on the surface temperature changes over the past 50 years 
  is robust. In some cases, ensembles of simulations have been run to reduce noise 
  in the estimates of the time-dependent response. Some studies have evaluated 
  seasonal variation of the response. Uncertainties in the estimated climate change 
  signals have made it difficult to attribute the observed climate change to one 
  specific combination of anthropogenic and natural influences, but all studies 
  have found a significant anthropogenic contribution is required to account for 
  surface and tropospheric trends over at least the last thirty years.</p>
