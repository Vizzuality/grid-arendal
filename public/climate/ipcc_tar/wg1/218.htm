<h2>6.3 Well-mixed Greenhouse Gases</h2>
<p>The well-mixed greenhouse gases have lifetimes long enough to be relatively 
  homogeneously mixed in the troposphere. In contrast, O<sub>3</sub> (<a href="225.htm">Section 
  6.5</a>) and the NMHCs (<a href="228.htm#66">Section 6.6</a>) are gases with 
  relatively short lifetimes and are therefore not homo-geneously distributed 
  in the troposphere.</p>
<p>Spectroscopic data on the gaseous species have been improved with successive 
  versions of the HITRAN (Rothman et al., 1992, 1998) and GEISA databases (Jacquinet-Husson 
  et al., 1999). Pinnock and Shine (1998) investigated the effect of the additional 
  hundred thousands of new lines in the 1996 edition of the HITRAN database (relative 
  to the 1986 and the 1992 editions) on the infrared radiative forcing due to 
  CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>3</sub>. They found 
  a rather small effect due to the additional lines, less than a 5% effect for 
  the radiative forcing of the cited gases and less than 1.5% for a doubling of 
  CO<sub>2</sub>. For the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and their replacements, the 
  uncertainties in the spectroscopic data are much larger than for CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>3</sub>, and differ more among the 
  various laboratory studies. Christidis et al. (1997) found a range of 20% between 
  ten different spectroscopic studies of CFC-11. Ballard et al. (2000) performed 
  an intercomparison of laboratory data from five groups and found the range in 
  the measured absorption cross-section of HCFC-22 to be about 10%.</p>
<p>Several previous studies of radiative forcing due to well-mixed greenhouse 
  gases have been performed using single, mostly global mean, vertical profiles. 
  Myhre and Stordal (1997) investigated the effects of spatial and temporal averaging 
  on the globally and annually averaged radiative forcing due to the well-mixed 
  greenhouse gases. The use of a single global mean vertical profile to represent 
  the global domain, instead of the more rigorous latitudinally varying profiles, 
  can lead to errors of about 5 to 10%; errors arising due to the temporal averaging 
  process are much less (~1%). Freckleton et al. (1998) found similar effects 
  and suggested three vertical profiles which could represent global atmospheric 
  conditions satisfactorily in radiative transfer calculations. In the above two 
  studies as well as in Forster et al. (1997), it is the dependence of the radiative 
  forcing on the tropopause height and thereby also the vertical temperature profile, 
  that constitutes the main reason for the need of a latitudinal resolution in 
  radiative forcing calculations. The radiative forcing due to halocarbons depends 
  on the tropopause height more than is the case for CO<sub>2</sub> (Forster et 
  al., 1997; Myhre and Stordal, 1997).</p>
<p>Not all greenhouse gases are well mixed vertically and horizontally in the 
  troposphere. Freckleton et al. (1998) have investigated the effects of inhomogeneities 
  in the concentrations of the greenhouse gases on the radiative forcing. For 
  CH<sub>4</sub> (a well-mixed greenhouse gas), the assumption that it is well-mixed 
  horizontally in the troposphere introduces an error much less than 1% relative 
  to a calculation in which a chemistry-transport model predicted distribution 
  of CH<sub>4</sub> was used. For most halocarbons, and to a lesser extent for 
  CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, the mixing ratio decays with altitude in 
  the stratosphere. For CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, this implies a reduction 
  in the radiative forcing of up to about 3% (Freckleton et al., 1998; Myhre et 
  al., 1998b). For most halocarbons, this implies a reduction in the radiative 
  forcing up to about 10% (Christidis et al., 1997; Hansen et al., 1997a; Minschwaner 
  et al., 1998; Myhre et al., 1998b) while it is found to be up to 40% for a short-lived 
  component found in Jain et al. (2000).</p>
<p>Trapping of the long-wave radiation due to the presence of clouds reduces the 
  radiative forcing of the greenhouse gases compared to the clear-sky forcing. 
  However, the magnitude of the effect due to clouds varies for different greenhouse 
  gases. Relative to clear skies, clouds reduce the global mean radiative forcing 
  due to CO<sub>2</sub> by about 15% (Pinnock et al., 1995; Myhre and Stordal, 
  1997), that due to CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O is reduced by about 20% 
  (derived from Myhre et al., 1998b), and that due to the halocarbons is reduced 
  by up to 30% (Pinnock et al., 1995; Christidis et al., 1997; Myhre et al., 1998b).</p>
<p>The effect of stratospheric temperature adjustment also differs between the 
  various well-mixed greenhouse gases, owing to different gas optical depths, 
  spectral overlap with other gases, and the vertical profiles in the stratosphere. 
  The stratospheric temperature adjustment reduces the radiative forcing due to 
  CO<sub>2</sub> by about 15% (Hansen et al., 1997a). CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O 
  estimates are slightly modified by the stratospheric temperature adjustment, 
  whereas the radiative forcing due to halocarbons can increase by up to 10% depending 
  on the spectral overlap with O<sub>3</sub> (IPCC, 1994).</p>
<p>Radiative transfer calculations are performed with different types of radiative 
  transfer schemes ranging from line-by-line models to band models (IPCC, 1994). 
  Evans and Puckrin (1999) have performed surface measurements of downward spectral 
  radiances which reveal the optical characteristics of individual greenhouse 
  gases. These measurements are compared with line-by-line calculations. The agreement 
  between the surface measurements and the line-by-line model is within 10% for 
  the most important of the greenhouse gases: CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, 
  N<sub>2</sub>O, CFC-11 and CFC-12. This is not a direct test of the irradiance 
  change at the tropopause and thus of the radiative forcing, but the good agreement 
  does offer verification of fundamental radiative transfer knowledge as represented 
  by the line-by-line (LBL) model. This aspect concerning the LBL calculation 
  is reassuring as several radiative forcing determinations which employ coarser 
  spectral resolution models use the LBL as a benchmark tool (Freckleton et al., 
  1996; Christidis et al., 1997; Minschwaner et al., 1998; Myhre et al., 1998b; 
  Shira et al., 2001). Satellite observations can also be useful in estimates 
  of radiative forcing and in the intercomparison of radiative transfer codes 
  (Chazette et al., 1998).</p>
