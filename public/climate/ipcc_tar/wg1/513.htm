<h3>14.2.6 Trace Gases, Aerosols, and the Climate System</h3>
<p>The goal is a completely interactive simulation of the dynamical, radiative, 
  and chemical processes in the atmosphere-ocean-land system with a central theme 
  of characterising adequately the radiative forcing in the past, in the present, 
  and into the future (See <a href="214.htm">Chapter 6, Sections 6.1</a> and <a href="216.htm">6.2</a>; 
  see also <a href="341.htm">Chapter 9, Section 9.1</a>). Such a model will be 
  essential in future studies of the broad question on the role of the oceans, 
  terrestrial ecosystems, and human activities in the regulation of atmospheric 
  concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and other radiatively active atmospheric constituents. 
  It will be required for understanding tropospheric trace constituents such as 
  nitrogen oxides, ozone, and sulphate aerosols. Nitrogen oxides are believed 
  to control the production and destruction of tropospheric ozone, which controls 
  the chemical reactivity of the lower atmosphere and is itself a significant 
  greenhouse gas. Tropospheric sulphate aerosols, carbonaceous aerosols from both 
  natural and anthropogenic processes, dust, and sea salt, on the other hand, 
  are believed to affect the Earth's radiation budget significantly, by scattering 
  solar radiation and through their effects on clouds. Systematic observations 
  of different terrestrial ecosystems and surface marine systems under variable 
  meteorological conditions are needed along with the development of ecosystem 
  and surface models that will provide parametrizations of these exchanges.<br>
</p>
<p>Models that incorporate atmospheric chemical processes provide the basis for 
  much of our current understanding in such critical problem areas as acid rain, 
  photochemical smog production in the troposphere, and depletion of the ozone 
  layer in the stratosphere. These formidable problems require models that include 
  chemical, dynamical, and radiative processes, which through their mutual interactions 
  determine the circulation, thermal structure, and distribution of constituents 
  in the atmosphere. That is, the problems require a coupling of the physics and 
  chemistry of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the models must be applicable on a 
  variety of spatial (regional-to-global) and temporal (days-to-decades) scales 
  (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>). A particularly important and challenging 
  issue is the need to reduce the uncertainty on the size and spatial pattern 
  of the indirect aerosol effects (see <a href="238.htm">Chapter 6, Section 6.8</a>).<br>
</p>
<p>Most of the effort in three-dimensional atmospheric chemistry models over the 
  last decade has been in the use of transport models in the analysis of certain 
  chemically active species, e.g., long-lived gases such as nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) 
  or the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). In part, the purpose of these studies was 
  not to improve our understanding of the chemistry of the atmosphere, but rather 
  to improve the transport formulation associated with general circulation models 
  and, in association with this improvement, to understand sources and sinks of 
  CO<sub>2</sub>. The additional burden imposed by incorporating detailed chemistry into 
  a comprehensive general circulation model has made long-term simulations and 
  transient experiments with existing computing resources challenging. Current 
  three-dimensional atmospheric chemistry models which focus on the stratosphere 
  seek a compromise solution by employing coarse resolution (both vertical and 
  horizontal dimensions); incorporating constituents by families (similar to the 
  practice used in most two-dimensional models); omitting or simplifying parametrizations 
  for tropospheric physical processes; or conducting "off line" transport 
  simulations in which previously calculated wind and temperature fields are used 
  as known input to continuity equations including chemical source/sink terms. 
  This last approach renders the problem tractable and has produced much progress 
  towards understanding the transport of chemically reacting species in the atmosphere. 
  The corresponding disadvantage is the lack of the interactive feedback between 
  the evolving species distributions and the atmospheric circulation. Better descriptions 
  of the complex relationship between hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen species as 
  well as hydrocarbons and other organic species are needed in order to establish 
  simplified chemical schemes that will be implemented in chemical/transport models. 
  In parallel, better descriptions of how advection, turbulence, and convection 
  affect the chemical composition of the atmosphere are needed. (See <a href="157.htm">Chapter 
  4, Section 4.5.2</a>.)<br>
</p>
<p>We also need improved understanding of the processes involving clouds, surface 
  exchanges, and their interactions with radiation. The coupling of aerosols with 
  both the energy and water cycles as well as with the chemistry components of 
  the system is of increasing importance. Determining feedbacks between the land 
  surface and other elements of the climate system will require careful attention 
  to the treatments of evapotranspiration, soil moisture storage and runoff. All 
  of these occur on spatial scales that are small compared with the model meshes, 
  so the question of scaling must be addressed. These improvements must be paralleled 
  by the acquisition of global data sets for validation of these treatments. Validation 
  of models against global and regional requirements for conservation of energy 
  is especially important in this regard. (See <a href="154.htm#451">Chapter 4, 
  Section 4.5.1</a>.)<br>
</p>
<p>The problems associated with how to treat clouds within the climate system 
  are linked to problems associated with aerosols. Current model treatments of 
  climate forcing from aerosols predict effects that are not easily consistent 
  with the past climate record. A major challenge is to develop and validate the 
  treatments of the microphysics of clouds and their interactions with aerosols 
  on the scale of a general circulation model grid. A second major challenge is 
  to develop an understanding of the carbon components of the aerosol system. 
  Meeting this challenge requires that we develop data for a mechanistic understanding 
  of carbonaceous aerosol effects on clouds as well as developing an understanding 
  of the magnitude of the anthropogenic and natural components of the carbonaceous 
  aerosol system. (See <a href="231.htm#67">Chapter 6, Sections 6.7</a> and <a href="238.htm">6.8</a>; 
  see also <a href="190.htm">Chapter 4, Section 4.5.1.2</a>.)<br>
</p>
<p>As attention is turned toward the troposphere, the experimental strategy simply 
  cannot adopt the stratospheric simplifications. The uneven distribution of emission 
  sources at the surface of the Earth and the role of meteorological processes 
  at various scales must be addressed directly. Fine-scaled, three-dimensional 
  models of chemically active trace gases in the troposphere are needed to resolve 
  transport processes at the highest possible resolution. These models should 
  be designed to simulate the chemistry and transport of atmospheric tracers on 
  global and regional scales, with accurate parametrizations of sub-scale processes 
  that affect the chemical composition of the troposphere. It is therefore necessary 
  to pursue an ambitious long-term programme to develop comprehensive models of 
  the troposphere system, including chemical, dynamical, radiative, and eventually 
  biological components. (See <a href="148.htm#44">Chapter 4, Sections 4.4</a> 
  to<a href="158.htm"> 4.6</a>.)<br>
</p>
<p>The short-lived radiatively important species pose an observational challenge. 
  The fact that they are short-lived implies that observations of the concentrations 
  are needed over wide spatial regions and over long periods of time. This is 
  particularly important for aerosols. The current uncertainties are non-trivial 
  (see again <a href="253.htm#fig67">Chapter 6, Figure 6.7</a>) and need to be 
  reduced.<br>
</p>
<p>In sum, there needs to be an expanded attack on the key contributors to uncertainty 
  about the behaviour of the climate system today and in the future. As stated 
  in <a href="477.htm">Chapter 13, Section 13.1.2</a>, "Scenarios should also 
  provide adequate quantitative measures of uncertainty. The sources of uncertainty 
  are many, including the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions in the future, 
  their conversion into atmospheric concentrations, the range of responses of 
  various climate models to a given radiative forcing and the method of constructing 
  high resolution information from global climate model outputs (see <a href="477.htm#fig132">Chapter 
  13, Figure 13.2</a>). For many purposes, simply defining a single climate future 
  is insufficient and unsatisfactory. Multiple climate scenarios that address 
  at least one, or preferably several, sources of uncertainty allow these uncertainties 
  to be quantified and explicitly accounted for in impact assessments." <br>
</p>
<p>In addition to this needed expansion in the attack on uncertainties in the 
  climate system, there is an important new challenge that should now be addressed 
  more aggressively. It is time to link more formally physical climate-biogeochemical 
  models with models of the human system. At present, human influences generally 
  are treated only through emission scenarios that provide external forcings to 
  the climate system. In future comprehensive models, human activities will interact 
  with the dynamics of physical, chemical, and biological sub-systems through 
  a diverse set of contributing activities, feedbacks, and responses. This does 
  not mean that it is necessary or even logical to attempt to develop prognostic 
  models of human actions since much will remain inherently unpredictable; however, 
  the scenarios analysis could and should be more fully coupled to the coupled 
  physical climate-biogeochemical system. <br>
</p>
<p>As part of the foundation-building to meet this challenge, we turn attention 
  now to the human system.</p>
