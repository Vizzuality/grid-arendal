<h2>7.3 Oceanic Processes and Feedbacks</h2>
<p>The ocean influences climate and climate change in various ways. Ocean currents 
  transport a significant amount of heat, usually directed poleward and thus contributing 
  to a reduction of the pole-to-equator temperature gradient; a remarkable exception 
  exists however in the South Atlantic where heat is transported equatorward, 
  i.e. up-gradient, into the North Atlantic. Because of its large heat capacity, 
  ocean heat storage largely controls the time-scales of variability to changes 
  in the ocean-atmosphere system, including the time-scales of adjustment to anthropogenic 
  radiative forcing. The ocean is coupled to the atmosphere primarily through 
  the fluxes of heat and fresh water which are strongly tied to the sea surface 
  temperature (see <a href="298.htm#761">Section 7.6.1</a>), and also through 
  the fluxes of radiatively active trace gases such as CO<sub>2</sub> (see <a href="095.htm">Chapter 
  3</a>) which can directly affect the atmospheric radiation balance. All ocean 
  processes which ultimately can influence these fluxes are relevant for climate 
  change. Processes in the ocean surface layer which are associated with seasonal 
  time-scales hence are of obvious relevance. As the budgets in the surface layer 
  depend on the exchange with deeper layers in the ocean, it is also necessary 
  to consider the processes which affect the circulation and water mass distribution 
  in the deep ocean, in particular when the response of the climate system at 
  decadal and longer time-scales is considered. Moreover, processes governing 
  vertical mixing are important in determining the time-scales on which changes 
  of, for example, deep ocean temperature and sea level evolve. </p>
<p> Since the SAR, the assessment of the status of ocean processes in climate 
  models has changed in two ways. On the one hand, advances in model resolution 
  and in the representation of sub-grid scale processes have led to a somewhat 
  improved realism in many model simulations. On the other hand, however, growing 
  evidence for a very high sensitivity of model results to the representation 
  of certain small-scale processes, in particular those associated with the THC, 
  has been found. As a consequence, considerable uncertainties still exist concerning 
  the extent to which present climate models correctly describe the oceanic response 
  to changes in the forcing.</p>
<h3><a name="731"></a>7.3.1 Surface Mixed Layer</h3>
<p>The surface mixed layer is directly influenced by the atmospheric fluxes which 
  are connected to the ocean interior by vigorous three-dimensional turbulence. 
  That turbulence is driven primarily by the surface wind stress and convective 
  buoyancy flux, and includes the wave driven Langmuir circulation (e.g., Weller 
  and Price, 1988; McWilliams et al., 1997). As a result, the upper ocean often 
  becomes well mixed.</p>
<p> The heat budget of the mixed layer is determined by horizontal advection, 
  surface heating, entrainment and the vertical heat flux at the mixed-layer base. 
  Entrainment occurs when there is sufficient turbulent energy to deepen the mixed 
  layer and can result in rapid cooling when accompanied by upwelling from Ekman 
  pumping. This pumping velocity at the mixed-layer base results from divergent 
  mixed-layer flow driven by the wind stress. The shallowing of the mixed layer 
  leads to a transfer of water from the mixed layer to the interior of the ocean. 
  The water that passes the deepest mixed-layer depth will not be re-entrained 
  within a seasonal cycle and is subducted. Large subduction rates are found where 
  horizontal gradients in mixed layer depth are large. Thus variations in mixed-layer 
  depth are of primary importance in setting the structure of the interior of 
  the ocean. This process can temporarily shield heat anomalies generated in the 
  mixed layer from the atmosphere. The subduction process itself is relatively 
  well understood (Spall et al., 2000), although the role of sub-grid processes 
  in modifying the subduction process needs further clarification (Hazeleger and 
  Drijfhout, 2000).</p>
<p> The surface buoyancy flux (combined net heat and fresh water flux) effectively 
  drives a cross-isopycnal mass flux by converting mixed-layer water from one 
  density class to another. Waters of intermediate density are transformed into 
  both lighter waters and heavier waters. In general, but especially in the Indian 
  and Pacific Oceans, the thermal and haline contributions are additive in forming 
  light tropical waters, but opposed in forming heavy polar waters. Despite this 
  cancellation about 15 Sv (1 Sverdrup = 1 Sv = 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) 
  of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is formed thermally. With more cancellation, 
  less than a few Sverdrups of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is formed in the 
  Southern Ocean. However, nearly 30 Sv of Antarctic Intermediate Water is formed 
  mostly by the haline effect.</p>
<p> In summary, proper parametrization of turbulence in the surface mixed layer 
  is crucial to correctly simulate air-sea exchange, SST and sea ice (e.g., Large 
  et al., 1997; Goosse et al., 1999), and thereby reduce the need for flux adjustments 
  in coupled models. While several schemes are in use (Large and Gent, 1999), 
  a systematic intercomparison of the properties, behaviour and accuracy of these 
  parametrizations is still lacking.</p>
