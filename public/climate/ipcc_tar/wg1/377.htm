<h3>10.1.2 The Regional Climate Problem </h3>
<p>A definition of regional scale is difficult, as different definitions are often 
  implied in different contexts. For example, definitions can be based on geographical, 
  political or physiographic considerations, considerations of climate homogeneity, 
  or considerations of model resolution. Because of this difficulty, an operational 
  definition is adopted in this chapter based on the range of "regional scale" 
  found in the available literature. From this perspective, regional scale is 
  here defined as describing the range of 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> km<sup>2</sup>. 
  The upper end of the range (10<sup>7</sup> km<sup>2</sup>) is also often referred 
  to as sub-continental scale, and marked climatic inhomogeneity can occur within 
  sub-continental scale regions in many areas of the globe. Circulations occurring 
  at scales greater than 10<sup>7</sup> km<sup>2</sup> (here referred to as "planetary 
  scales") are clearly dominated by general circulation processes and interactions. 
  The lower end of the range (10<sup>4</sup> km<sup>2</sup>) is representative 
  of the smallest scales resolved by current regional climate models. Scales smaller 
  than 10<sup>4</sup> km<sup>2</sup> are referred to as "local scale". 
</p>
<p>Given these definitions, the climate of a given region is determined by the 
  interaction of forcings and circulations that occur at the planetary, regional 
  and local spatial scales, and at a wide range of temporal scales, from sub-daily 
  to multi-decadal. Planetary scale forcings regulate the general circulation 
  of the global atmosphere. This in turn determines the sequence and characteristics 
  of weather events and weather regimes that characterise the climate of a region. 
  Embedded within the planetary scale circulation regimes, regional and local 
  forcings and mesoscale circulations modulate the spatial and temporal structure 
  of the regional climate signal, with an effect that can in turn influence planetary 
  scale circulation features. Examples of regional and local scale forcings are 
  those due to complex topography, land-use characteristics, inland bodies of 
  water, land-ocean contrasts, atmospheric aerosols, radiatively active gases, 
  snow, sea ice, and ocean current distribution. Moreover, climatic variability 
  of a region can be strongly influenced through teleconnection patterns originated 
  by forcing anomalies in distant regions, such as in the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern 
  Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phenomena.</p>
<p>The difficulty of simulating regional climate change is therefore evident. 
  The effects of forcings and circulations at the planetary, regional and local 
  scale need to be properly represented, along with the teleconnection effects 
  of regional forcing anomalies. These processes are characterised by a range 
  of temporal variability scales, and can be highly non-linear. In addition, similarly 
  to what happens for the global Earth system, regional climate is also modulated 
  by interactions among different components of the climate system, such as the 
  atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere and chemo-sphere, which may require 
  coupling of these components at the regional scale. <br>
  Therefore, a cross-disciplinary and multi-scale approach is necessary for a 
  full understanding of regional climate change processes. This is based on the 
  use of AOGCMs to simulate the global climate system response to planetary scale 
  forcings and the variability patterns associated with broad regional forcing 
  anomalies (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>). The information provided 
  by the AOGCMs can then be enhanced to account for regional and local processes 
  via a suitable use of the regionalisation techniques discussed in this chapter.</p>
