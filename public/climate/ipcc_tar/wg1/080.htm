<h4><a name="2533"></a>2.5.3.3 Upper-tropospheric and lower-stratospheric water 
  vapour </h4>
<p>Recently assessed increases in lower stratospheric water vapour mixing ratio 
  over the last few decades are likely to have caused a decrease in stratospheric 
  temperatures by an amount comparable to that produced by ozone decreases (Forster 
  and Shine, 1999; Smith et al., 2001) (see lower-stratospheric temperature trends 
  in <a href="059.htm#223">Section 2.2.3</a>). These changes also impact on ozone 
  chemistry (<a href="127.htm">Chapter 4</a>) and on radiative forcing of the 
  atmosphere (<a href="212.htm">Chapters 6</a> and <a href="260.htm">7</a>). Data 
  from over twenty-five instruments that measure water vapour concentration and 
  relative humidity in the upper troposphere and stratosphere were recently compared 
  and assessed in the international SPARC study (Kley et al., 2000). The purpose 
  of the study, which included measurements made by both in situ and remote sensing 
  techniques utilising balloons, aircraft and satellites, was to determine the 
  data quality and to estimate the magnitude of any trends. The study showed that 
  some stratospheric instruments have sampled over a long enough period that several 
  overlapping time-series of intermediate length (8 to 15 years) can be used to 
  help evaluate stratospheric changes. A reasonable degree of consistency was 
  found among strato-spheric measurements made from near the tropopause up to 
  as high as 50 km (about 1 hPa). Most observations were within &plusmn;10% of 
  the grand mean of all measurements to which they were compared. </p>
<p>Accurate balloon observations of lower-stratospheric water vapour are available 
  from 1964 to 1976 over Washington, D.C. and from 1980 to present over Boulder, 
  Colorado, USA (e.g., Mastenbrook, 1968; Harries, 1976; Mastenbrook and Oltmans, 
  1983; Oltmans and Hofmann, 1995). The SPARC study shows that these point measurements 
  are nevertheless representative of global stratospheric conditions above about 
  18 to 20 km, but not of the lowest stratosphere where there can be significant 
  regional and seasonal changes. A positive lower stratosphere trend of about 
  1 to 1.5%/year in specific humidity (about 0.04 ppm/year) since the mid-1960s 
  is indicated by the balloon data (Oltmans et al., 2000). The increase was not 
  monotonic but showed several rapid rises with plateaux in between. Even though 
  the recent satellite record is relatively short, these measurements have revealed 
  changes of the same character. The satellite results show a spatial pattern 
  of trends in the lower stratosphere, and suggest a slowing in the positive trend 
  after 1996 (Smith et al., 2000). Although not definitive, these observations 
  are consistent in suggesting that lower-stratospheric water vapour has increased 
  globally on average at about 1%/year over at least the past forty years, but 
  at a variable rate.</p>
<p>Although radiosondes have made observations of water vapour in the upper troposphere 
  (i.e., above 500 hPa) since the 1950s, these observations have suffered from 
  instrumental errors (Elliott and Gaffen, 1991). Peixoto and Oort (1996) have 
  re-examined these observations for the period 1974 to 1988 and found large trends 
  in upper-tropospheric humidity at the 300 hPa level. They concluded that these 
  trends were unrealistically large and were likely to be due to instrument changes. 
  Satellite observations of upper-tropospheric humidity (UTH) measurements made 
  by TOVS (Television infrared observation satellite Operational Vertical Sounder) 
  since 1979, and representative of a deep layer between 500 to 200 hPa, show 
  very large interannual variability (Bates et al., 1996). The SPARC assessment 
  of these observations (Kley et al., 2000) indicated that they were of sufficient 
  quality for trend analyses. The SPARC study and an analysis by Bates and Jackson 
  (2001) show large regional trends that are attributed to circulation changes 
  associated with ENSO, decadal variability over equatorial Africa, and decadal 
  variability of the Arctic Oscillation (see <a href="083.htm#26">Section 2.6</a>). 
  Statistically significant positive trends of 0.1%/year are found for 10&deg;N 
  to 10&deg;S, and a non-significant trend of 0.04%/year for 60&deg;N to 60&deg;S, 
  but this includes a component negative trend of -0.1%/year for 30oS to 
  60oS. The trends in large zonal bands tend to be residuals from cancellations 
  in sign and magnitude of much larger regional trends. These UTH trends should 
  be treated with caution especially in the deep tropics because of significant 
  interannual variability and persistence, both of which hamper trend detection. 
</p>
<p>In summary, in situ and radiosonde measurements tend to show increasing water 
  vapour in the lower troposphere and near the surface, though this is not seen 
  everywhere, and data quality is still an issue. The longer, more reliable data 
  sets suggest multi-decadal increases in atmospheric water vapour of several 
  per cent per decade over regions of the Northern Hemisphere. New analyses of 
  balloon and satellite records indicate that strato-spheric water vapour above 
  18 km shows an increase of about 1%/year for the period 1981 to 2000 but with 
  a slowing of the positive trend after 1996. Satellite observations of upper-tropo-spheric 
  humidity from 1980 to 1997 show statistically significant positive trends of 
  0.1%/year for the zone 10&deg;N to 10&deg;S.</p>
