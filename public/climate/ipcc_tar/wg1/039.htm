<h1><a name="11"></a>1.1 Introduction to the Climate System</h1>
<h3><a name="111"></a>1.1.1 Climate</h3>
<p><i>Weather and climate</i><br>
  Weather and climate have a profound influence on life on Earth. They are part 
  of the daily experience of human beings and are essential for health, food production 
  and well-being. Many consider the prospect of human-induced climate change as 
  a matter of concern. The IPCC Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter 
  SAR) presented scientific evidence that human activities may already be influencing 
  the climate. If one wishes to understand, detect and eventually predict the 
  human influence on climate, one needs to understand the system that determines 
  the climate of the Earth and of the processes that lead to climate change.</p>
<p>In common parlance the notions "weather" and "climate" 
  are loosely defined<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn1.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a>. The "weather", as we experience it, is the fluctuating 
  state of the atmosphere around us, characterised by the temperature, wind, precipitation, 
  clouds and other weather elements. This weather is the result of rapidly developing 
  and decaying weather systems such as mid-latitude low and high pressure systems 
  with their associated frontal zones, showers and tropical cyclones. Weather 
  has only limited predictability. Mesoscale convective systems are predictable 
  over a period of hours only; synoptic scale cyclones may be predictable over 
  a period of several days to a week. Beyond a week or two individual weather 
  systems are unpredictable. "Climate" refers to the average weather 
  in terms of the mean and its variability over a certain time-span and a certain 
  area. Classical climatology provides a classification and description of the 
  various climate regimes found on Earth. Climate varies from place to place, 
  depending on latitude, distance to the sea, vegetation, presence or absence 
  of mountains or other geographical factors. Climate varies also in time; from 
  season to season, year to year, decade to decade or on much longer time-scales, 
  such as the Ice Ages. Statistically significant variations of the mean state 
  of the climate or of its variability, typically persisting for decades or longer, 
  are referred to as "climate change". The <a href="518.htm">Glossary</a> gives definitions 
  of these important and central notions of "climate variability" and 
  "climate change".</p>
<p>Climate variations and change, caused by external forcings, may be partly predictable, 
  particularly on the larger, continental and global, spatial scales. Because 
  human activities, such as the emission of greenhouse gases or land-use change, 
  do result in external forcing, it is believed that the large-scale aspects of 
  human-induced climate change are also partly predictable. However the ability 
  to actually do so is limited because we cannot accurately predict population 
  change, economic change, technological development, and other relevant characteristics 
  of future human activity. In practice, therefore, one has to rely on carefully 
  constructed scenarios of human behaviour and determine climate projections on 
  the basis of such scenarios.</p>
<p><i>Climate variables</i><br>
  The traditional knowledge of weather and climate focuses on those variables 
  that affect daily life most directly: average, maximum and minimum temperature, 
  wind near the surface of the Earth, precipitation in its various forms, humidity, 
  cloud type and amount, and solar radiation. These are the variables observed 
  hourly by a large number of weather stations around the globe.</p>
<p>However this is only part of the reality that determines weather and climate. 
  The growth, movement and decay of weather systems depend also on the vertical 
  structure of the atmosphere, the influence of the underlying land and sea and 
  many other factors not directly experienced by human beings. Climate is determined 
  by the atmospheric circulation and by its interactions with the large-scale 
  ocean currents and the land with its features such as albedo, vegetation and 
  soil moisture. The climate of the Earth as a whole depends on factors that influence 
  the radiative balance, such as for example, the atmospheric composition, solar 
  radiation or volcanic eruptions. To understand the climate of our planet Earth 
  and its variations and to understand and possibly predict the changes of the 
  climate brought about by human activities, one cannot ignore any of these many 
  factors and components that determine the climate. We must understand the climate 
  system, the complicated system consisting of various components, including the 
  dynamics and composition of the atmosphere, the ocean, the ice and snow cover, 
  the land surface and its features, the many mutual interactions between them, 
  and the large variety of physical, chemical and biological processes taking 
  place in and among these components. "Climate" in a wider sense refers 
  to the state of the climate system as a whole, including a statistical description 
  of its variations. This chapter provides the reader with an overview of the 
  climate system and the climate in this wider sense, and acts as an introduction 
  to the Report.</p>
