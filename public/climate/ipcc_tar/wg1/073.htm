<h3><a name="242"></a>2.4.2 How Stable was the Holocene Climate? </h3>
<p>Ice core, marine and terrestrial records show that the Holocene was marked 
  by a millennial-scale mode of variability (Meese et al., 1994; O'Brien 
  et al., 1995; Bond et al., 1997; Yiou et al., 1997a,b). These variations affect 
  both atmospheric (Mayewski et al., 1997) and oceanic (Bianchi and McCave, 1999) 
  indicators. The occurrence of very large floods in the south-western United 
  States also reflects substantial low-frequency variability (Ely et al., 1993). 
  SSTs reconstructed from analyses of a sub-tropical, high sedimentation rate 
  site off West Africa might indicate a remarkably high amplitude Holocene variability 
  of 5 to 8&deg;C on a time-scale about 1,500 years (deMenocal, 1998). During 
  the later Holocene, New Zealand speleothems indicate a lowering of temperature 
  after about 7 ky BP, with small advances of the mountain glaciers in the Southern 
  Alps near about 4 and 2.5 ky BP (Salinger and McGlone, 1989). Speleothem records 
  also indicate a temperature decrease of about 1.5&deg;C some 2 to 3 ky ago (Williams 
  et al., 1999). These indications are consistent with cooler periods at these 
  times shown by South African speleothems (Partridge, 1997). By contrast, temperature 
  peaks appeared in China at about 7 ky BP and at 5.5 to 6 ky BP (Wang and Gong, 
  2000).</p>

<p>Central Greenland ice cores and European lake isotopic records show correlated 
  temperature variations within the Holocene, with a roughly 50% higher amplitude 
  at Summit Greenland, compared to Europe (<a href="#fig224">Figure 2.24</a>). 
  The most prominent event in both records occurred about 8,200 years BP (Alley 
  et al., 1997; von Grafenstein et al., 1998; Barber et al., 1999) when annual 
  mean temperatures dropped by as much as 2&deg;C in mid-Europe and the European 
  alpine timberline fell by about 200 m (Wick and Tinner, 1999). The event may 
  be related to a significant decrease of SST in the Norwegian Sea (Klitgaard-Kristensen 
  et al., 1998). Lake records from the southern border of the Sahara indicate 
  extremely dry conditions during this time, and probably also during other cool 
  but less dramatic events of this kind (Street-Perrot and Perrot, 1990 ; Gasse 
  and Van Campo, 1994). The about 8,200 year cooling may also have been worldwide 
  (Stager and Mayewski, 1997), although abrupt early Holocene climate changes 
  recorded in a North American lake are thought to reflect a different event (Hu 
  et al., 1999). Thus cooling is indicated in the New Zealand Southern Alps, with 
  small advances of the mountain glaciers at about 8,000 years BP (Salinger and 
  McGlone, 1989). </p>
<p>Further abrupt climatic changes and reversals on millennial time-scales during 
  the Holocene are documented from pollen and lake level records e.g., in Europe 
  (Magny, 1995; Pazdur et al., 1995; Combourieu-Nebout et al., 1998), North Africa 
  (Gasse et al., 1990; Lamb et al., 1995), North America (Jacobson et al., 1987; 
  Overpeck et al., 1991) and Australia (Kershaw et al., 1991). Holocene lake level 
  changes in Europe have been shown to correlate (Magny, 1995; Yu and Harrisson, 
  1996) with millennial-scale changes in North Atlantic SST and salinity records 
  (Duplessy et al., 1992; Gasse and van Campo, 1994), suggesting a possible link 
  between millennial thermohaline circulation variability and atmospheric circulation 
  over Europe.</p>
<p>The early Holocene was generally warmer than the 20th century but the period 
  of maximum warmth depends on the region considered. It is seen at the beginning 
  of the Holocene (about 11 to 10 ky BP) in most ice cores from high latitude 
  regions e.g., north-west Canada (Ritchie et al., 1989), central Antarctica (Ciais 
  et al., 1992; Masson et al., 2000) and in some tropical ice cores such as Huascaran 
  in Peru (Thompson et al., 1995). It is also seen during the early Holocene in 
  the Guliya ice core in China (Thompson et al., 1998) but not in two other Chinese 
  cores (Dunde, Thompson et al., 1989; and Dasuopu, to be published). North Africa 
  experienced a greatly expanded monsoon in the early and mid-Holocene, starting 
  at 11 ky BP (Petit-Maire and Guo, 1996), and declining thereafter. In New Zealand 
  the warmest conditions occurred between about 10 to 8 ky BP, when there was 
  a more complete forest cover than at any other time. Glacial activity was at 
  a minimal level in the Southern Alps and speleothem analyses indicate temperatures 
  were about 2&deg;C warmer than present (Salinger and McGlone, 1989; Williams 
  et al., 1999). </p>
<p>By contrast, central Greenland (Dahl-Jensen et al., 1998), and regions downstream 
  of the Laurentide ice sheet, did not warm up until after 8 ky BP (including 
  Europe: COHMAP Members, 1988; eastern North America: Webb et al., 1993). The 
  East Asian monsoon did not commence its expanded phase until after 8 ky BP (Sun 
  and Chen, 1991; Harrison et al., 1996; Yu and Qin, 1997; Ren and Zhang, 1998). 
  A more detailed description of the climate at 6 ky BP as well as of the mechanisms 
  involved is given in <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>. Long-term climate changes 
  during the Holocene are consistent with the effects of orbital forcing, modified 
  by the persistence of the Laurentide ice sheet (which finally disappeared around 
  6 ky BP). </p>
<p>Seasonal to interannual climate variability may also have varied its character 
  during the Holocene. This is a period for which a variety of palaeo-proxies 
  and archaeological investigations (e.g., Sandweiss et al., 1996; Rodbell et 
  al., 1999) provide evidence for past variations in the strength and frequency 
  of ENSO extremes. A 16-year long time-series of temperature and hydrological 
  balance from a coral dated at 5,370 years BP from the Great Barrier Reef (Gagan 
  et al., 1998) implies that ENSO, or its teleconnections to Australia, were substantially 
  different in the mid-Holocene than today. Mid-Holocene changes in the spectrum 
  of ENSO variability have also been implicated by sedimentary palaeoclimatic 
  records in Australasia (McGlone et al., 1992; Shulmeister and Lees, 1995) and 
  South America (Sandweiss et al., 1996; Rodbell et al., 1999). </p>
<p>To sum up, the Holocene shows both long-term trends (including changes in the 
  nature of ENSO) and millennial time-scale variability although the amplitude 
  of the variability is small compared with that characteristic of Ice Ages. As 
  more detailed information becomes available, the timing of the Holocene maximum 
  warmth is seen to differ across the globe. There appears to be a south to north 
  pattern, with southern latitudes displaying maximum warming a few millennia 
  before the Northern Hemisphere regions. Interestingly, the Holocene appears 
  by far the longest warm "stable" period (as far as seen from the Antarctic 
  climate record) over the last 400 ky, with profound implications for the development 
  of civilisation (Petit et al., 1999).</p>
