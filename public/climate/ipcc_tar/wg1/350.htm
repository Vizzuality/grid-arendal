<p><a name="fig95"></a>Please note that the use of projections for forming climate 
  scenarios to study the impacts of climate change is discussed in <a href="474.htm">Chapter 
  13</a>.</p>
<p>These experiments include changes in greenhouse gases plus the direct effect 
  of sulphate aerosol using IS92a type forcing (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a> for a complete discussion of direct and indirect effect forcing from sulphate 
  aerosols). The temperature change (<a href="#fig95">Figures 9.5a</a> and <a href="#fig97">9.7a</a>, 
  top) for the 30-year average 2021 to 2050 compared with 1961 to 1990 is +1.3&deg;C 
  with a range of +0.8 to +1.7&deg;C as opposed to +1.6&deg;C with a range of 
  +1.0 to +2.1&deg;C for greenhouse gases only (Cubasch and Fischer-Bruns, 2000). 
  The experiments including sulphate aerosols show a smaller temp-erature rise 
  compared to experiments without sulphate aerosols due to the negative radiative 
  forcing of these aerosols. Additionally, in these simulations CO<sub>2</sub> 
  would double around year 2060. Thus for the averaging period being considered, 
  years 2021 to 2050, the models are still short of the CO<sub>2</sub> doubling 
  point seen in the idealised 1%/yr CO<sub>2</sub> increase simulations. These 
  sensitivity ranges could be somewhat higher (about 30%) if the positive feedback 
  effects from the carbon cycle are included interactively but the magnitude of 
  these feedbacks is uncertain (Cox et al., 2000; Friedlingstein, 2001). The globally 
  averaged precipitation response for 2021 to 2050 for greenhouse gases plus sulphates 
  is +1.5% with a range of +0.5 to +3.3% as opposed to +2.3% with a range of +0.9 
  to +4.4% for greenhouse gases only (<a href="#fig95">Figures 9.5</a>b and <a href="#fig97">9.7a</a>, 
  bottom). </p>
<h4><a name="9313"></a>9.3.1.3 Marker scenario experiments (SRES)</h4>
<p>As discussed in <a href="342.htm">Section 9.1.2</a>, only the draft marker 
  SRES scenarios A2 and B2 have been integrated with more than one AOGCM, because 
  the scenarios were defined too late to have experiments ready from all the modelling 
  groups in time for this report. Additionally, some new versions of models have 
  been used to run the A2 and B2 scenarios that have not had time to be evaluated 
  by <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>. Therefore, we present results from all the 
  model simulations and consider them all as possible realisations of future climate 
  change, but their ranges are not directly comparable to the simple model results 
  in <a href="353.htm#933">Section 9.3.3</a> (range: 1.4 to 5.8&deg;C), because 
  in the simple model analysis seven somewhat different versions of the nine models 
  have been considered. Additionally, for the AOGCMs the temperature changes are 
  evaluated for an average of years 2071 to 2100 compared with 1961 to 1990, while 
  the simple model results are differences of the year 2100 minus 1990.</p>
<p>The average temperature response from nine AOGCMs using the SRES A2 forcing 
  (<a href="#fig96">Figures 9.6a</a> and <a href="#fig97">9.7b</a>, top) for the 
  30-year average 2071 to 2100 relative to 1961 to 1990 is +3.0&deg;C with a range 
  of +1.3 to +4.5&deg;C, while using the SRES B2 scenarios it amounts to +2.2&deg;C 
  with a range of +0.9 to +3.4&deg;C. The B2 scenario produces a smaller warming 
  which is consistent with its lower positive radiative forcing at the end of 
  the 21st century. For the 30-year average 2021 to 2050 using the A2 scenario, 
  the globally averaged surface air temperature increase compared with 1961 to 
  1990 is +1.1&deg;C with a range of +0.5 to +1.4&deg;C, while using the SRES 
  B2 scenarios it amounts to +1.2&deg;C with a range of +0.5 to +1.7&deg;C. The 
  values for the SRES scenarios for the mid-21st century are lower than for the 
  IS92a scenarios for the corresponding period due to differences in the forcing.</p>
<p>The average precipitation response using the SRES A2 forcing (<a href="#fig96">Figures 
  9.6b</a> and <a href="#fig97">9.7b</a>, bottom) for the 30-year average 2071 
  to 2100 compared with 1961 to 1990 is an increase of 3.9% with a range of 1.3 
  to 6.8% , while using the SRES B2 scenarios it amounts to an increase of 3.3% 
  with a range of 1.2 to 6.1%. The lower precipitation increase values for the 
  B2 scenario are consistent with less globally averaged warming for that scenario 
  at the end of the 21st century compared with A2. For the 30-year average 2021 
  to 2050 the globally averaged precipitation increases 1.2% for the A2 scenario, 
  and 1.6% for B2 which is again consistent with the slightly greater global warming 
  in B2 for mid-21st century compared with A2. Globally averaged changes of temperature 
  and precipitation are summarised in <a href="#fig97">Figure 9.7b</a>. A more 
  extensive analysis of globally averaged temperature changes for a wider range 
  of SRES forcing scenarios using a simple climate model is given in <a href="353.htm#933">Section 
  9.3.3</a>.</p>
