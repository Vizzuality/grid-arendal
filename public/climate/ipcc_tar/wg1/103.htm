<h4>3.2.2.5 Effects of anthropogenic nitrogen deposition </h4>
<p>Nitrogen availability is an important constraint on NPP (Vitousek et al., 1997), 
  although phosphorus and calcium may be more important limiting nutrients in 
  many tropical and sub-tropical regions (Matson, 1999). Reactive nitrogen is 
  released into the atmosphere in the form of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) 
  during fossil fuel and biomass combustion and ammonia emitted by industrial 
  regions, animal husbandry and fertiliser use (<a href="127.htm">Chapter 4</a>). 
  This nitrogen is then deposited fairly near to the source, and can act as a 
  fertiliser for terrestrial plants. There has been a rapid increase in reactive 
  nitrogen deposition over the last 150 years (Vitousek et al., 1997; Holland 
  et al., 1999). Much field evidence on nitrogen fertilisation effects on plants 
  (e.g., Chapin, 1980; Vitousek and Howarth, 1991; Bergh et al., 1999) supports 
  the hypothesis that additional nitrogen deposition will result in increased 
  NPP, including the growth of trees in Europe (Spiecker et al., 1996). There 
  is also evidence (Fog, 1988; Bryant et al., 1998) that N fertilisation enhances 
  the formation of modified soil organic matter and thus increases the residence 
  time of carbon in soils.<br>
  <br>
  Tracer experiments with addition of the stable isotope 15N provide insight into 
  the short-term fate of deposited reactive nitrogen (Gundersen et al., 1998). 
  It is clear from these experiments that most of the added N added to the soil 
  surface is retained in the ecosystem rather than being leached out via water 
  transport or returned to the atmosphere in gaseous form (as N<sub>2</sub>, NO, 
  N<sub>2</sub>O or NH<sub>3</sub>). Studies have also shown that the tracer is 
  found initially in the soil (Nadelhoffer et al., 1999), but that it enters the 
  vegetation after a few years (Clark 1977; Schimel and Chapin, 1996; Delgado 
  et al., 1996; Schulze, 2000).<br>
  <br>
  There is an upper limit to the amount of added N that can fertilise plant growth. 
  This limit is thought to have been reached in highly polluted regions of Europe. 
  With nitrogen saturation, ecosystems are no longer able to process the incoming 
  nitrogen deposition, and may also suffer from deleterious effects of associated 
  pollutants such as ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nutrient imbalance, and aluminium 
  toxicity (Schulze et al., 1989; Aber et al., 1998). </p>
<h4><a name="3226"></a>3.2.2.6 Additional impacts of changing atmospheric chemistry</h4>
<p>Current tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in Europe and North America 
  cause visible leaf injury on a range of crop and tree species and have been 
  shown to reduce the growth and yield of crops and young trees in experimental 
  studies. The longer-term effects of O<sub>3</sub> on forest productivity are 
  less certain, although significant negative associations between ozone exposure 
  and forest growth have been reported in North America (Mclaughlin and Percy, 
  2000) and in central Europe (Braun et al., 2000). O3 is taken up through stomata, 
  so decreased stomatal conductance at elevated CO<sub>2</sub> may reduce the 
  effects of O<sub>3</sub> (Semenov et al., 1998, 1999). There is also evidence 
  of significant interactions between O<sub>3</sub> and soil water availability 
  in effects on stem growth or NPP from field studies (e.g., Mclaughlin and Downing, 
  1995) and from modelling studies (e.g., Ollinger et al., 1997). The regional 
  impacts of O<sub>3</sub> on NPP elsewhere in the world are uncertain, although 
  significant impacts on forests have been reported close to major cities. Fowler 
  et al. (2000) estimate that the proportion of global forests exposed to potentially 
  damaging ozone concentrations will increase from about 25% in 1990 to about 
  50% in 2100. </p>
<p>Other possible negative effects of industrially generated pollution on plant 
  growth include effects of soil acidification due to deposition of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> 
  and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Severe forest decline has been observed in 
  regions with high sulphate deposition, for instance in parts of eastern Europe 
  and southern China. The wider effects are less certain and depend on soil sensitivity. 
  Fowler et al. (2000) estimate that 8% of global forest cover received an annual 
  sulphate deposition above an estimated threshold for effects on acid sensitive 
  soils, and that this will increase to 17% in 2050. The most significant long-term 
  effect of continued acid deposition for forest productivity may be through depletion 
  of base cations, with evidence of both increased leaching rates and decreased 
  foliar concentrations (Mclaughlin and Percy, 2000), although the link between 
  these changes in nutrient cycles and NPP needs to be quantified.</p>
<h4><a name="3227"></a>3.2.2.7 Additional constraints on terrestrial CO<sub>2</sub> 
  uptake</h4>
<p>It is very likely that there are upper limits to carbon storage in ecosystems 
  due to mechanical and resource constraints on the amount of above ground biomass 
  and physical limits to the amount of organic carbon that can be held in soils 
  (Scholes et al., 1999). It is also generally expected that increased above-ground 
  NPP (production of leaves and stem) will to some extent be counterbalanced by 
  an increased rate of turnover of the biomass as upper limits are approached.</p>
