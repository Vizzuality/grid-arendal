<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly established 
  by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment 
  Programme (UNEP) in 1988. Its terms of reference include (i) to assess available 
  scientific and socio-economic information on climate change and its impacts 
  and on the options for mitigating climate change and adapting to it and (ii) 
  to provide, on request, scientific/technical/socio-economic advice to the Conference 
  of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
  (UNFCCC). From 1990, the IPCC has produced a series of Assessment Reports, Special 
  Reports, Technical Papers, methodologies and other products that have become 
  standard works of reference, widely used by policymakers, scientists and other 
  experts.<br>
</p>
<p>This volume, which forms part of the Third Assessment Report (TAR), has been 
  produced by Working Group I (WGI) of the IPCC and focuses on the science of 
  climate change. It consists of 14 chapters covering the physical climate system, 
  the factors that drive climate change, analyses of past climate and projections 
  of future climate change, and detection and attribution of human influences 
  on recent climate. <br>
</p>
<p>As is usual in the IPCC, success in producing this report has depended first 
  and foremost on the knowledge, enthusiasm and co-operation of many hundreds 
  of experts worldwide, in many related but different disciplines. We would like 
  to express our gratitude to all the Co-ordinating Lead Authors, Lead Authors, 
  Contributing Authors, Review Editors and Reviewers. These individuals have devoted 
  enormous time and effort to produce this report and we are extremely grateful 
  for their commitment to the IPCC process. We would like to thank the staff of 
  the WGI Technical Support Unit and the IPCC Secretariat for their dedication 
  in co-ordinating the production of another successful IPCC report. We are also 
  grateful to the governments, who have supported their scientists' participation 
  in the IPCC process and who have contributed to the IPCC Trust Fund to provide 
  for the essential participation of experts from developing countries and countries 
  with economies in transition. We would like to express our appreciation to the 
  governments of France, Tanzania, New Zealand and Canada who hosted drafting 
  sessions in their countries, to the government of China, who hosted the final 
  session of Working Group I in Shanghai, and to the government of the United 
  Kingdom, who funded the WGI Technical Support Unit.<br>
</p>
<p>We would particularly like to thank Dr Robert Watson, Chairman of the IPCC, 
  for his sound direction and tireless and able guidance of the IPCC, and Sir 
  John Houghton and Prof. Ding Yihui, the Co-Chairmen of Working Group I, for 
  their skillful leadership of Working Group I through the production of this 
  report.</p>
