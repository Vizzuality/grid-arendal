<h4>10.3.1.2 Climate variability and extreme events </h4>
<p>Analysis of global climate model performance in reproducing observed regional 
  climate variability has given widely varying results depending on model and 
  region. Interannual variability in temperature was assessed regionally, as well 
  as globally, in a long control simulation with the HadCM2 model (Tett et al., 
  1997). Many aspects of model variability compared well against observations, 
  although there was a tendency for temperature variability to be too high over 
  land. In the multi-regional study of Giorgi and Francisco (2000a), both regional 
  temperature and precipitation interannual variability of HadCM2 were found to 
  be generally overestimated. Similar results were obtained in the European study 
  of Machenhauer et al. (1998) using the ECHAM/OPYC3 model. However, in a 200-year 
  control simulation with the CGCM1 model (see <a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a>), 
  Flato et al. (2000) noted that simulated interannual variability in seasonal 
  temperature and precipitation compared well with observations both globally 
  and in five selected study regions (Sahel, North America, Australia, southern 
  Europe and Southeast Asia).</p>
<p>Comparison against observations of daily precipitation variability as simulated 
  at grid boxes in GCMs is problematic because the corresponding variability in 
  the real world operates at much finer spatial scale (see Hennessy et al., 1997). 
  A significant development in this area has been the work of Osborn and Hulme 
  (1997) who devised a method of calculating grid box average observed daily precipitation 
  that corrects for biases commonly introduced by insufficient station density. 
  Using this correction, agreement between observations and the results of the 
  CSIRO GCM were significantly improved. In an analysis of different AGCMs over 
  Europe, Osborn and Hulme (1998) found that the models commonly simulated precipitation 
  in winter to be more frequent and less intense than observed. Daily temperature 
  variability over Europe was found to be too high in winter in the Hadley Centre 
  model (Gregory and Mitchell, 1995) and in winter and spring in the ECHAM3/LSG 
  model (Buishand and Beersma, 1996).</p>
<p>Synoptic circulation variability at daily and longer time-scales operates at 
  a spatial scale which GCMs can simulate directly and work has focused on GCM 
  performance in this area (e.g., Katzfey and McInnes, 1996; Huth, 1997; Schubert, 
  1998; Wilby et al., 1998a; Osborn et al., 1999; Fyfe, 1999). Regions studied 
  include North America, Europe, southern Africa, Australia and East Asia. Although 
  in many respects model performance is good, some studies have noted synoptic 
  variability to be less than in the observations and the more extreme deviations 
  from the mean flow to be less intense or less frequent than observed (e.g., 
  Osborn et al., 1999). </p>
<p>Simulated climatic variability has also been examined as part of assessing 
  model representation of the link between atmospheric circulation and local climate. 
  Results have shown considerable regional differences. Osborn et al. (1999) examined 
  the relationship between the circulation anomalies and grid-box average temperature 
  and precipitation anomalies and found this to be well represented by the HadCM2 
  model. However, Wilby and Wigley (2000) found HadCM2 less satisfactory in reproducing 
  the observed correlations between daily precipitation over six regions in the 
  United States and a variety of different atmospheric predictor variables. In 
  a similar investigation over Europe, Busuioc et al. (1999) found the performance 
  of the ECHAM3 AGCM to be good in some seasons.</p>
<p>Widmann and Bretherton (2000) examined precipitation variability from atmospheric 
  reanalyses as an alternative method of validating GCMs under historic flow conditions. 
  By virtue of this approach, the atmospheric circulation is constrained to be 
  unbiased, but the precipitation is calculated according to model physics and 
  parametrizations. Results based on the GCM used in the reanalysis were found 
  to be in good agreement with observations over Oregon and Washington. </p>
