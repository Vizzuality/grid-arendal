<h4>5.4.1.1 Comparison of large-scale sulphate models (COSAM)</h4>
<p>One measure of our knowledge comes from the convergence in predictions made 
  by a variety of models. Difficulties in the analysis and evaluation of such 
  comparisons can result from models employing different emissions, meteorological 
  fields etc. A set of standardised input was provided for the Comparison of Large 
  Scale Sulphate Aerosol Models (COSAM) workshop which took place in 1998 and 
  1999 (see Barrie et al., 2001). Ten models participated in this comparison. 
  As noted above in Section <a href="172.htm#5226">5.2.2.6</a>, the simulation 
  of the processes determining the sulphate concentration differed considerably 
  between models. The fraction of sulphur removed by precipitation ranged from 
  50 to 80% of the total source of sulphur. The fraction of total chemical production 
  of sulphate from SO<sub>2</sub> that took place in clear air (in contrast to 
  in-cloud) ranged from 10 to 50%. This latter variability points to important 
  uncertainties in current model capability to predict the indirect forcing by 
  anthropogenic sulphate, because the mechanism of sulphate production determines 
  the number of CCN produced (<a href="183.htm">Section 5.3.3</a>). <br>
</p>
<p> The ability of the models to predict the vertical distributions of aerosols 
  was examined by comparing model predictions of the vertical distribution of 
  SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, SO<sub>2</sub> and related parameters such as ozone, 
  hydrogen peroxide and cloud liquid-water content to mean profiles taken during 
  aircraft campaigns at North Bay, a remote forested location (in southern Nova 
  Scotia) 500 km north of the city of Toronto (Lohmann et al., 2001). For SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, 
  the models were within a factor of 2 of the observed mean profiles (which were 
  averages of 64 and 46 profiles for North Bay and Novia Scotia, respectively) 
  but there was a tendency for the models to be higher than observations. The 
  sulphur dioxide concentration was generally within a factor of two of the observations. 
  Those models that overpredicted SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> also underpredicted 
  SO<sub>2</sub>, demonstrating that the model treatment for the chemical transformation 
  of SO<sub>2</sub> to SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is a source of uncertainty 
  in the prediction of the vertical distribution of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>.</p>
<p>A comparison of modelled and observed ground level sulphate at 25 remote sites 
  showed that on average, most models predict surface level seasonal mean SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> 
  aerosol mixing ratios to within 20%, but that surface SO<sub>2</sub> was overestimated 
  by 100% or more. A high resolution limited area model performed best by matching 
  both parameters within 20%. This was consistent with the large variation in 
  the ability of models to transport and disperse sulphur in the vertical.</p>
<p> Both regional source budget analyses (Roelofs et al., 2001) as well as long-range 
  transport model tests (Barrie et al., 2001) suggest that the dominant cause 
  of model-to-model differences is the representation of cloud processes (e.g. 
  aqueous-phase sulphate production rates, wet deposition efficiency and vertical 
  transport efficiencies) and horizontal advection to remote regions.<br>
</p>
<p> In summary, the COSAM model comparison showed that both convective transport 
  and oxidation of sulphur dioxide to sulphate are processes that are not well 
  simulated in large-scale models. In addition, the treatment of dry and wet deposition 
  of aerosols and aerosol precursors continues to lead to important variations 
  among the models. These variations lead to uncertainties in atmospheric sulphate 
  concentrations of up to a factor of 2. The uncertainties in SO<sub>2</sub> are 
  larger than those for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>.</p>
