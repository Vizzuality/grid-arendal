<h2>9.2 Climate and Climate Change </h2>
<p><a href="038.htm">Chapter 1</a> discusses the nature of the climate system 
  and the climate variability and change it may undergo, both naturally and as 
  a consequence of human activity. The projections of future climate change discussed 
  in this chapter are obtained using climate models in which changes in atmospheric 
  composition are specified. The models "translate" these changes in 
  composition into changes in climate based on the physical processes governing 
  the climate system as represented in the models. The simulated climate change 
  depends, therefore, on projected changes in emissions, the changes in atmospheric 
  greenhouse gas and particulate (aerosol) concentrations that result, and the 
  manner in which the models respond to these changes. The response of the climate 
  system to a given change in forcing is broadly characterised by its "climate 
  sensitivity". Since the climate system requires many years to come into 
  equilibrium with a change in forcing, there remains a "commitment" 
  to further climate change even if the forcing itself ceases to change. </p>
<p>Observations of the climate system and the output of models are a combination 
  of a forced climate change "signal" and internally generated natural 
  variability which, because it is random and unpredictable on long climate time-scales, 
  is characterised as climate "noise". The availability of multiple 
  simulations from a given model with the same forcing, and of simulations from 
  many models with similar forcing, allows ensemble methods to be used to better 
  characterise projected climate change and the agreement or disagreement (a measure 
  of reliability) of model results.</p>
<h3><a name="921"></a>9.2.1 Climate Forcing and Climate Response</h3>
<p><i>The heat balance</i><br>
  Broad aspects of global mean temperature change may be illustrated using a simple 
  representation of the heat budget of the climate system expressed as: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> dH/dt = F - <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/alfa-s.gif" width="8" height="8">T.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here F is the radiative forcing change as discussed in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>; aT represents the net effect of processes acting to counteract changes 
  in mean surface temperature, and dH/dt is the rate of heat storage in the system. 
  All terms are differences from unperturbed equilibrium climate values. A positive 
  forcing will act to increase the surface temperature and the magnitude of the 
  resulting increase will depend on the strength of the feedbacks measured by 
  <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/alfa-s.gif" width="8" height="8">T. If <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/alfa-s.gif" width="8" height="8"> 
  is large, the temperature change needed to balance a given change in forcing 
  is small and vice versa. The result will also depend on the rate of heat storage 
  which is dominated by the ocean so that dH/dt = dH<sub>o</sub>/dt = F<sub>o</sub> 
  where H<sub>o</sub> is the ocean heat content and F<sub>o</sub> is the flux 
  of heat into the ocean. With this approximation the heat budget becomes F = 
  <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/alfa-s.gif" width="8" height="8">T + F<sub>o</sub>, indicating 
  that both the feedback term and the flux into the ocean act to balance the radiative 
  forcing for non-equilibrium conditions. </p>
<p><i>Radiative forcing in climate models</i><br>
  A radiative forcing change, symbolised by F above, can result from changes in 
  greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosol loading in the atmosphere. The calculation 
  of F is discussed in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a> where a new estimate of 
  CO<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing is given which is smaller than the value in 
  the SAR. According to <a href="219.htm">Section 6.3.1</a>, the lower value is 
  due mainly to the fact that stratospheric temperature adjustment was not included 
  in the (previous) estimates given for the forcing change. It is important to 
  note that this new radiative forcing estimate does not affect the climate change 
  and equilibrium climate sensitivity calculations made with general circulation 
  models. The effect of a change in greenhouse gas concentration and/or aerosol 
  loading in a general circulation model (GCM) is calculated internally and interactively 
  based on, and in turn affecting, the three dimensional state of the atmosphere. 
  In particular, the stratospheric temperature responds to changes in radiative 
  fluxes due to changes in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and the GCM calculation 
  includes this effect.</p>
<p><i>Equivalent CO<sub>2</sub></i><br>
  The radiative effects of the major greenhouse gases which are well-mixed throughout 
  the atmosphere are often represented in GCMs by an "equivalent" CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration, namely the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration that gives a radiative 
  forcing equal to the sum of the forcings for the individual greenhouse gases. 
  When used in simulations of forced climate change, the increase in "equivalent 
  CO<sub>2</sub>" will be larger than that of CO<sub>2</sub> by itself, since 
  it also accounts for the radiative effects of other gases.</p>
<p><i>1%/yr increasing CO<sub>2</sub> </i><br>
  A common standardised forcing scenario specifies atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  to increase at a rate of 1%/year compound until the concentration doubles (or 
  quadruples) and is then held constant. The CO<sub>2</sub> content of the atmosphere 
  has not, and likely will not, increase at this rate (let alone suddenly remain 
  constant at twice or four times an initial value). If regarded as a proxy for 
  all greenhouse gases, however, an "equivalent CO<sub>2</sub>" increase 
  of 1%/yr does give a forcing within the range of the SRES scenarios.</p>
<p>This forcing prescription is used to illustrate and to quantify aspects of 
  AOGCM behaviour and provides the basis for the analysis and intercomparison 
  of modelled responses to a specified forcing change (e.g., in the SAR and the 
  CMIP2 intercomparison). The resulting information is also used to calibrate 
  simpler models which may then be employed to investigate a broad range of forcing 
  scenarios as is done in <a href="353.htm#933">Section 9.3.3</a>. <a href="345.htm#fig91">Figure 
  9.1</a> illustrates the global mean temperature evolution for this standardised 
  forcing in a simple illustrative example with no exchange with the deep ocean 
  (the green curves) and for a full coupled AOGCM (the red curves). The diagram 
  also illustrates the transient climate response, climate sensitivity and warming 
  commitment. </p>
