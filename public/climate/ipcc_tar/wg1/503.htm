<h2>14.2 The Climate System</h2>
<h3>14.2.1 Overview<a name="1421"></a></h3>
<p>Models of physical processes in the ocean and atmosphere provide much of our 
  current understanding of future climate change. They incorporate the contributions 
  of atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics through the methods of computational 
  fluid dynamics. This approach was initially developed in the 1950s to provide 
  an objective numerical approach to weather prediction. It is sometimes forgotten 
  that the early development of "supercomputers" at that time was motivated 
  in large part by the need to solve this problem. In the 1960s, versions of these 
  weather prediction models were developed to study the "general circulation" 
  of the atmosphere, i.e., the physical statistics of weather systems satisfying 
  requirements of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. To obtain realistic 
  simulations, it was found necessary to include additional energy sources and 
  sinks: in particular, energy exchanges with the surface and moist atmospheric 
  processes with the attendant latent heat release and radiative heat inputs. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Development of models for the general circulation of the ocean started later, 
  but has proceeded in a similar manner. Models that deal with the physics of 
  the oceans have been developed and linked to models of the atmospheric system. 
  Within ocean models, the inclusion of geochemical and biological interactions 
  has begun, with a focus upon the carbon cycle. Since the late 1960s, the geochemical 
  aspects of the carbon cycle have been included in low-dimensional box models. 
  More recently, including the carbon chemistry system in general circulation 
  models has simply been a question of allocation of computing resources. Modelling 
  of the biological system, however, has been more challenging, and it has only 
  been recently that primitive ecosystem models have been incorporated in global 
  general circulation ocean models. Even though progress has been significant, 
  much remains to be done. Eddy-resolving ocean models with chemistry and biology 
  need to be tested and validated in a transient mode, and the prognostic aspects 
  of marine ecosystems including nutrient dynamics need greater attention at basin 
  and global scales.<br>
</p>
<p>Model development for the ocean and atmosphere has had a fundamental theoretical 
  advantage: it is based on firmly established hydrodynamic equations. At present 
  there is less theoretical basis for a "first principles" development 
  of the dynamical behaviour of the terrestrial system. There is a need to develop 
  a fundamental methodology to describe this very heterogeneous and complex system. 
  For the moment, it is necessary to rely heavily upon parametrizations and empirical 
  relationships. Such reliance is data intensive and hence independent validation 
  of terrestrial system models is problematical. In spite of these difficulties, 
  a co-ordinated strategy has been developed to improve estimates of terrestrial 
  primary productivity and respiration by means of measurement and modelling. 
  The strategy has begun to yield dividends. Techniques from statistical mechanics 
  have been wedded to biogeochemistry and population ecology, yielding new vegetation 
  dynamic models. Global terrestrial models at meso-spatial scales (roughly 50 
  km grids) now exist which capture complex ecophysiological processes and ecosystem 
  dynamics. <br>
</p>
<p>Expanded efforts are needed in these domain-specific models. In the ocean, 
  we need to consider better the controls on thermohaline circulation, on potential 
  changes in biological productivity, and on the overall stability of the ocean 
  circulation system. Within terrestrial systems the question of the carbon sink-source 
  pattern is central: what is it and how might it change? Connected to this question 
  is the continued development of dynamic vegetation models, which treat competitive 
  processes within terrestrial ecosystems and their response to multiple stresses. 
  And for the atmosphere, a central question has been, is, and likely will be 
  the role of clouds. Also, there is a corresponding non-linearity associated 
  with change in the distribution and extent of sea ice. Further increased efforts 
  will be needed in linking terrestrial ecosystems with the atmosphere, the land 
  with the ocean, the ocean (and its ecosystems) with the atmosphere, the chemistry 
  of the atmosphere with the physics of the atmosphere, and finally linking the 
  human system to them all. Such models will also need to be able to highlight 
  different regions with increased spatial and temporal detail.<br>
</p>
<p>Models, however, depend upon high quality data. Data allow hypotheses about 
  processes and their linkages to be rejected or to be given increased consideration. 
  Giving formal (e.g., quantitative) expression to processes is at the heart of 
  the scientific enterprise. Such expressions reflect our knowledge and form the 
  basis for models. Models are simply formal expressions of processes and how 
  they fit together. And all rest upon data. Models are of limited use without 
  observations; the value of observations increases by interaction with models. 
  Systematic global observations are an essential underpinning of research to 
  improve understanding of the climate system. For numerous applications in climate-impact 
  research, information about the complex nature of the system is needed. Unfortunately, 
  there continue to be justifiable concerns about the loss of some monitoring 
  of climate parameters and deterioration of coverage. There is a basic need for 
  more observations with better coverage, higher accuracy, and with increased 
  availability. This overriding importance of data has been recognised repeatedly 
  in the past and in this volume (e.g., <a href="093.htm">Chapter 2, Section 2.8</a>; 
  <a href="110.htm">Chapter 3, Section 3.5</a>; <a href="134.htm">Chapter 4, Section 
  4.2</a>; <a href="253.htm">Chapter 6, Section 6.14</a>; <a href="436.htm#1161">Chapter 
  11, Section 11.6.1</a> and <a href="456.htm">Chapter 12, Section 12.4</a>), 
  and there are reasons for guarded optimism on the issue of data even though 
  there are also significant reasons for concern. One such reason for tempered 
  optimism is the plan for and beginning implementation of global observing systems 
  such as the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), Global Ocean Observing System 
  (GOOS), and Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS). However plans in themselves 
  do not produce data, and data that are not accessible are of limited value. 
  The issue of data remains central for progress.</p>
