<p> Several issues arise that deserve some discussion. The first such issue is 
  the concatenation of uncertainties in the empirical relationship between the 
  concentration of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> andN<sub>d</sub>. The uncertainty 
  in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is straightforward and is based on the assessment 
  of uncertainty in burden and the uncertainty in emissions as used in <a href="197.htm#542">Section 
  5.4.2</a>. The uncertainty in the relationship between SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> 
  andN<sub>d</sub>, equation <a href="203.htm#eq3">(3)</a>, requires an evaluation 
  of the uncertainties in the coefficients A and B. Based on a comparison of the 
  parametrization of Boucher and Lohmann (1995) with that of Jones et al. (1994b) 
  (<a href="184.htm#fig57">Figure 5.7</a>), we assign an ad hoc contribution of 
  the functional relationship to the uncertainty inN<sub>d</sub>of 40% of the 
  central value. We then further assume that the uncertainties in A and B contribute 
  equally to the total uncertainty (i.e., 40%) and, with these constraints, derived 
  the uncertainties in A and B. This allows us to use Taylor expansions for both 
  the perturbed and unperturbed atmosphere. Due largely to the form of the functional 
  relationship, this procedure yields uncertainties whose major components in 
  both the perturbed and unperturbed cases are attributable to the uncertainty 
  in the parametrization (61% for the unperturbed case and 64% for the perturbed 
  case) rather than the uncertainty in burden or emissions.<br>
</p>
<p> In order to assess the overall uncertainty in forcing, the covariance between 
  the base parametersN<sub>d</sub>, LWC and h must be evaluated. But both LWC 
  and h are assumed to be constant in the first indirect effect, and therefore 
  the covariance is assumed to be zero. Certainly, the limited observations available 
  (cf., Hegg et al., 1996b) do not show any covariance. Nevertheless, it is important 
  to note this potential effect and the possible impact of the second indirect 
  effect (precipitation modulation effects by aerosols) on the uncertainty in 
  the first.<br>
</p>
<p> Another covariance which cannot be neglected arises in the evaluation of the 
  uncertainty in DAp from the possible covariance between A<sub>c</sub> and A<sub>c</sub>'. 
  This covariance arises because of the dependence of the perturbation in cloud 
  albedo on both the unperturbed aerosol concentration and the unperturbed albedo. 
  We assessed this covariance by using equations <a href="203.htm#eq4">(4)</a> 
  and <a href="203.htm#eq3">(3)</a> to generate a set of corresponding values 
  of the perturbed and unperturbed albedos for different values ofN<sub>d</sub>. 
  Then a linear fit to the parameters <font face="Symbol">D</font>N<sub>d</sub> 
  and A<sub>c</sub>' was used to derive the correlation coefficient and then the 
  covariance. Various sample sizes and incremental values of the aerosol perturbation 
  were generated to test the stability of the correlation. This procedure resulted 
  in a stable correlation coefficient between A<sub>c</sub> and A<sub>c</sub>' 
  of 0.74. </p>
<p> A final issue arises as to the choice of susceptible cloud fraction (f<sub>c</sub>) 
  in the basic forcing equation. Here, we follow the analysis of Charlson et al. 
  (1987) and use the estimates in the cloud atlas of Warren et al. (1988). The 
  total fractional cover of low and mid level clouds is not used since mid-level 
  clouds can be mixed phase and the relationship of these clouds to anthropogenic 
  aerosol is still unclear (<a href="186.htm">Section 5.3.6</a>). Instead, we 
  use the estimates of Charlson et al. (1987) for non-overlapped low marine cloud 
  as a lower bound (2/3 bound) for the susceptible cloud fraction and the sum 
  (correcting for overlap) of the low and middle marine stratiform cloud as an 
  upper limit for fc. The central value is taken as midway between these extremes.

<p>The above assumptions, together with the parameter values given in <a href="#tab513">Table 
  5.13</a>, yield a central value for the indirect forcing over marine areas of 
  -1.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup> together with an uncertainty of &plusmn;1.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. 
  Hence, the forcing lies in the range between zero and -2.8 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. 
  This range is in reasonable agreement with that given in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>, based on GCM assessments. Nearly all of the uncertainty in the forcing 
  is associated with that in the planetary albedo which, in turn, is dominated 
  by the uncertainties in the perturbed and unperturbed cloud albedos, and thus 
  in the cloud optical depths. However, it is interesting to note that most of 
  the uncertainty in the optical depths for both perturbed and unperturbed clouds 
  arises from the uncertainties in the cloud LWC and cloud thickness, and not 
  from the uncertainties in the CDNC. This is not actually particularly surprising 
  and is simply due to the stronger functional dependence of the optical depth 
  on the LWC and thickness, h. This allocation of uncertainty may be slightly 
  misleading because the 1st indirect effect depends on an assumption of fixed 
  h and LWC. Yet here we are concerned with evaluating both the central estimate 
  as well as its uncertainty. Hence, knowledge of h and LWC are needed. Indeed, 
  consideration of these parameters and the accuracy of their representation in 
  GCMs must certainly contribute to any uncertainty in the estimates of forcing 
  from GCMs. Thus, it seems clear that progress in reducing the uncertainty in 
  the indirect forcing of the first kind will be at least as dependent on acquiring 
  better data on cloud LWC and thickness as on better quantifying anthropogenic 
  aerosol concentrations and their effects on N<sub>d</sub>. At a somewhat lower 
  priority, it is clearly quite important to better understand the relationship 
  between cloud drop number concentration and sulphate concentration. The total 
  uncertainty is clearly dependent on this relationship. If it were significantly 
  different in form, a somewhat different order of contribution to total uncertainty 
  might have arisen. On the other hand, the uncertainty in the magnitude of the 
  emissions of sulphur gases as well as the uncertainty in the burden of sulphate 
  played only a minor role in the determination of the overall uncertainty.</p>
