<h4>3.7.3.4 Stabilisation scenarios and their implications for futureCO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions</h4>
<p>Stabilisation scenarios illustrate implied rates of CO<sub>2</sub> emission 
  that would arrive at various stable CO<sub>2</sub> concentration levels. These 
  have been projected using a similar methodology to that applied in the analysis 
  of emissions scenarios. The WRE trajectories follow CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  consistent with the IS92a scenario beginning in 1990 and branch off to reach 
  constant CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of 450, 550, 650, 750 and 1,000 ppm (Wigley 
  et al., 1996). The rationale for various alternative time trajectories and stabilisation 
  levels is discussed in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a> of the IPCC WGIII Third 
  Assessment Report (Morita et al., 2001). Differences in emissions pathways for 
  different time trajectories leading to a certain stabilisation target (e.g., 
  S versus WRE profiles) are discussed in Schimel et al., (1997). Here, we have 
  calculated emissions for one set of emission profiles to illustrate differences 
  in implied emissions that arise from updating models since the SAR. </p>
<p>As in <a href="122.htm">Section 3.7.3.2</a>, the models were initialised up 
  to present. Then anthropogenic emissions for the prescribed CO<sub>2</sub> stabilization 
  profiles were calculated; deduced emissions equal the change in modeled ocean 
  and terrestrial carbon inventories plus the prescribed change in atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> content. To estimate the strength of carbon cycle-climate feedbacks, 
  global temperature (ISAM) and changes in the fields of temperature, precipitation 
  and cloud cover (Bern-CC) were projected from CO<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing 
  only, neglecting effects of other greenhouse gases and aerosols which are not 
  specified in the WRE profiles. The results for the reference cases are not substantially 
  different from those presented in the SAR (<a href="#fig313">Figure 3.13</a>). 
  However, the range based on alternative model parametrizations is larger than 
  presented in the SAR, mainly due to the range of simulated terrestrial CO<sub>2</sub> 
  uptake. CO<sub>2</sub> stabilisation at 450, 650 or 1,000ppm would require global 
  anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to drop below 1990 levels, within a few 
  decades, about a century, or about two centuries, respectively.</p>
<p>In all cases, once CO<sub>2</sub> concentration becomes constant, the implied 
  anthropogenic emission declines steadily. This result was expected. It highlights 
  the fact that to maintain a constant future CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, anthropogenic 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would ultimately have to be reduced to the level of 
  persistent natural sinks. Persistent terrestrial sinks are not well quantified; 
  peatlands may be a candidate, but the gradual rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration during the present interglacial (<a href="105.htm#fig32">Figure 
  3.2</a>) argues against any such sink. Estimates of current uptake by peatlands 
  are &lt;0.1 PgC/yr (Clymo et al., 1998). Mixing of ocean DIC between surface 
  and deep waters should continue to produce ocean uptake for several centuries 
  after an input of anthropogenic atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (Siegenthaler and 
  Oeschger, 1978; Maier-Reimer and Hasselmann, 1987; Sarmiento et al., 1992). 
  This mixing is the main reason for continued uptake (and therefore positive 
  calculated emissions) after stabilisation. However, the main, known natural 
  sink expected to persist longer than a few centuries is that due to dissolution 
  of CaCO<sub>3</sub> in ocean sediments, which increases ocean alkalinity and 
  thereby allows additional CO<sub>2</sub> to dissolve in the ocean. For CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations about 1,000 ppm, this sink is estimated to be smaller than about 
  -0.1 PgC/yr (Archer et al., 1998). Thus, for any significant CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions to persist over centuries without continuing to increase atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> would require some method of producing an artificial carbon sink.</p>
