<h2>10.8 Summary Assessment</h2>
<p>Today different modelling tools are available to provide climate change information 
  at the regional scale. Coupled AOGCMs are the fundamental models used to simulate 
  the climatic response to anthropogenic forcings and, to date, results from AOGCM 
  simulations have provided the climate information for the vast majority of impact 
  studies. On the other hand, resolution limitations pose severe constraints on 
  the usefulness of AOGCM information, especially in regions characterised by 
  complex physiographic settings. Three classes of regionalisation techniques 
  have been developed to enhance the regional information of coupled AOGCMs: high 
  resolution and variable resolution time-slice AGCM experiments, regional climate 
  modelling, and empirical/statistical and statistical/dynamical approaches. </p>
<p>Since the SAR, substantial progress has been achieved in all regionalisation 
  methods, including better understanding of the techniques, development of a 
  wide variety of modelling systems and methods, application of the techniques 
  to a wide range of studies and regional settings, and reduction of model biases. 
  Modelling work has indicated that regionalisation techniques enhance some aspects 
  of AOGCM regional information, such as the high resolution spatial detail of 
  precipitation and temperature, and the statistics of daily precipitation events. 
  It is important to stress that AOGCM information is the starting point for the 
  application of all regionalisation techniques, so that a foremost requirement 
  in the simulation of regional climate change is that the AOGCMs simulate well 
  the circulation features that affect regional climates. In this respect, indications 
  are that the performance of current AOGCMs is generally improving.</p>
<p>Analysis of AOGCM simulations for broad (sub-continental scale) regions indicates 
  that biases in the simulation of present day regionally and seasonally averaged 
  surface climate variables, although highly variable across regions and models, 
  are generally improved compared with the previous generation models. This implies 
  increased confidence in simulated climatic changes. The performance of models 
  in reproducing observed interannual variability varies across regions and models.</p>
<p>Regional analysis of AOGCM transient simulations extending to 2100, for different 
  scenarios of GHG increase and sulphate aerosol effects, and with a number of 
  modelling systems (some simulations include ensembles of realisations) indicate 
  that the average climatic changes for the late decades of the 21st century compared 
  to present day climate vary substantially across regions and models. The primary 
  source of uncertainty in the simulated changes is associated with inter-model 
  range of changes, with inter-scenario and intra-ensemble range of simulated 
  changes being less pronounced. Despite the range of inter-model results, some 
  common patterns of sub-continental scale climatic changes are emerging, and 
  thus providing increased confidence in the simulation of these changes. </p>
<p>Work performed with all regionalisation techniques indicates that sub-GCM grid 
  scale structure in the regional climate change signal can occur in response 
  to regional and local forcings, although more work is needed to assess the statistical 
  significance of the sub-GCM grid scale signal. In particular, modelling evidence 
  clearly indicates that topography, land use and the surface hydrologic cycle 
  strongly affect the surface climate change signal at the regional to local scale. 
  This implies that the use of AOGCM information for impact studies needs to be 
  taken cautiously, especially in regions characterised by pronounced sub-GCM 
  grid scale variability in forcings, and that suitable regionalisation techniques 
  should be used to enhance the AOGCM results over these regions.</p>
<p>Considerations of various types may enter the choice of the regionalisation 
  technique, as different techniques may be most suitable for different applications 
  and different working environments. High resolution AGCMs offer the primary 
  advantage of global coverage and two-way interactions between regional and global 
  climate. However, due to their computational cost, the resolution increase that 
  can be expected from these models is limited. Variable resolution and RCMs yield 
  a greater increase in resolution, with current RCMs reaching resolutions as 
  fine as a few tens of kilometres or less. RCMs can capture physical processes 
  and feedbacks occurring at the regional scale, but they are affected by the 
  errors of the AOGCM driving fields, and they do not represent regional-to-global 
  climate feedbacks. The effects of regional-to-global feedback processes depend 
  on the specific problem and in many cases may not be important. Two-way GCM-RCM 
  nesting would allow the description of such effects, and some research efforts 
  in that direction are currently under way. Statistical downscaling techniques 
  offer the advantages of being computationally inexpensive, of providing local 
  information which is needed in many impact applications, and of offering the 
  possibility of being tailored to specific applications. However, these techniques 
  have limitations inherent in their empirical nature.</p>
<p>The combined use of different techniques may provide the most suitable approach 
  in many instances. For example, a high-resolution AGCM simulation could represent 
  an important intermediate step between AOGCM information and RCM or statistical 
  downscaling models. The convergence of results from different approaches applied 
  to the same problem can increase the confidence in the results and differences 
  between approaches can help to understand the behaviour of the models.</p>
<p>Despite recent improvements and developments, regionalisation research is still 
  a maturing process and the related uncertainties are still rather poorly known. 
  One of the reasons for this is that most regionalisation research activities 
  have been carried out independently of each other and aimed at specific objectives. 
  Therefore a coherent picture of regional climate change via available regionalisation 
  techniques cannot yet be drawn. More co-ordinated efforts are thus necessary 
  to improve the integrated hierarchy of models, evaluate the different methodologies, 
  intercompare methods and models and apply these methods to climate change research 
  in a comprehensive strategy.</p>
