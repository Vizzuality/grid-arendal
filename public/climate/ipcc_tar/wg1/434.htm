<h3>11.5.4 Longer Term Changes </h3>
<p>Anthropogenic emissions beyond 2100 are very uncertain, and we can only indicate 
  a range of possibilities for sea level change. On the time-scale of centuries, 
  thermal expansion and ice sheet changes are likely to be the most important 
  processes.</p>
<h4><a name="11541"></a>11.5.4.1 Thermal expansion</h4>
<p>The most important conclusion for thermal expansion is that it would continue 
  to raise sea level for many centuries after stabilisation of greenhouse gas 
  concentrations, so that its eventual contribution would be much larger than 
  at the time of stabilisation. A number of investigations have aimed to quantify 
  this delayed but inevitable consequence of the enhanced greenhouse effect, using 
  a simple scenario in which carbon dioxide concentration increases rapidly (at 
  1%/yr, not intended as a realistic historical scenario) up to double or four 
  times its initial value (referred to as 2xCO<sub>2</sub> and 4xCO<sub>2</sub>), 
  and thereafter remains constant. (2xCO<sub>2</sub> is about 540 ppm by volume, 
  and 4xCO<sub>2</sub> about 1080 ppm.) Long experiments of this kind have been 
  run with three AOGCMs (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>, <a href="316.htm#tab81">Table 
  8.1</a>): GFDL (Manabe and Stouffer, 1994; Stouffer and Manabe, 1999), ECHAM3/LSG 
  (Voss and Mikolajewicz, 2001) and HadCM2 (Senior and Mitchell, 2000), but owing 
  to the computational requirement, only one of these (GFDL) has been continued 
  until a steady state is reached. Models of intermediate complexity (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>, <a href="316.htm#tab81">Table 8.1</a>) have also been employed: CLIMBER, 
  BERN2D and UVic. These models have a less detailed representation of some important 
  processes, but are less expensive to run for millennia. </p>
<p>Thermal expansion could be greater in one model than another either because 
  the surface warming is larger, or because the warming penetrates more deeply 
  (<a href="431.htm#fig1115">Figure 11.15</a>, <a href="431.htm#tab1116">Table 
  11.16</a>; the suffixes to the BERN2D and UVic model names indicate versions 
  of the models with different parametrizations of heat transport processes). 
  For instance, UVic H and UVic GM show markedly different expansion, although 
  they have similar surface warming (Weaver and Wiebe, 1999). The 4xCO<sub>2</sub> 
  experiment with each model generally has around twice the expansion of the 2xCO<sub>2</sub> 
  experiment, but the BERN2D HOR 4xCO<sub>2</sub> experiment has more than 
  three times, because the Atlantic thermohaline circulation collapses, permitting 
  greater warming and adding about 0.5 m to thermal expansion (Knutti and Stocker, 
  2000). (See also <a href="358.htm">Section 9.3.4.4.</a>) In all the models reported 
  here, a vertical temperature gradient is maintained, although in some cases 
  weakened. If the whole depth of the ocean warmed to match the surface temperature, 
  thermal expansion would be considerably larger.</p>
<p>The long time-scale (of the order of 1,000 years) on which thermal expansion 
  approaches its eventual level is characteristic of the weak diffusion and slow 
  circulation processes that transport heat to the deep ocean. On account of the 
  time-scale, the thermal expansion in the 2xCO<sub>2</sub> experiments after 
  500 years of constant CO<sub>2</sub> is 4 to 9 times greater than at the time 
  when the concentration stabilises. Even by this time, it may only have reached 
  half of its eventual level, which models suggest may lie within a range of 0.5 
  to 2.0 m for 2xCO<sub>2</sub> and 1 to 4 m for 4xCO<sub>2</sub>. For 
  the first 1,000 years, the 4xCO<sub>2</sub> models give 1 to 3 m.</p>
<h4><a name="11542"></a>11.5.4.2 Glaciers and ice caps</h4>
<p>Melting of all existing glaciers and ice caps would raise sea level by 0.5 
  m (<a href="412.htm#tab113">Table 11.3</a>). For 1990 to 2100 in IS92a, the 
  projected loss from land-ice outside Greenland and Antarctica is 0.05 to 0.11 
  m (<a href="427.htm#tab1112">Table 11.12</a>). Further contraction of glacier 
  area and retreat to high altitude will restrict ablation, so we cannot use the 
  21st century rates to deduce that there is a time by which all glacier mass 
  will have disappeared. However, the loss of a substantial fraction of the total 
  glacier mass is likely. The viability of any particular glacier or ice cap will 
  depend on whether there remains any part of it, at high altitude, where ablation 
  does not exceed accumulation over the annual cycle. Areas which are currently 
  marginally glaciated are most likely to become ice-free.</p>
