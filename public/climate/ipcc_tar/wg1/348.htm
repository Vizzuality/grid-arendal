<p><a name="fig93"></a>Projections of climate change are affected by a range of 
  uncertainties (see also <a href="500.htm">Chapter 14</a>) and there is a need 
  to discuss and to quantify uncertainty in so far as is possible. Uncertainty 
  in projected climate change arises from three main sources; uncertainty in forcing 
  scenarios, uncertainty in modelled responses to given forcing scenarios, and 
  uncertainty due to missing or misrepresented physical processes in models. These 
  are discussed in turn below. </p>
<p>Forcing scenarios: The use of a range of forcing scenarios reflects uncertainties 
  in future emissions and in the resulting greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosol 
  loadings in the atmosphere. The complexity and cost of full AOGCM simulations 
  has restricted these calculations to a subset of scenarios; these are listed 
  in <a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a> and discussed in <a href="349.htm#931">Section 
  9.3.1</a>. Climate projections for the remaining scenarios are made with less 
  general models and this introduces a further level of uncertainty. <a href="351.htm">Section 
  9.3.2</a> discusses global mean warming for a broad range of scenarios obtained 
  with simple models calibrated with AOGCMs. <a href="474.htm">Chapter 13</a> 
  discusses a number of techniques for scaling AOGCM results from a particular 
  forcing scenario to apply to other scenarios. </p>
<p>Model response: The ensemble standard deviation and the range are used as available 
  indications of uncertainty in model results for a given forcing, although they 
  are by no means a complete characterisation of the uncertainty. There are a 
  number of caveats associated with the ensemble approach. Common or systematic 
  errors in the simulation of current climate (e.g., Gates et al., 1999; Lambert 
  and Boer, 2001; <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>) survive ensemble averaging 
  and contribute error to the ensemble mean while not contributing to the standard 
  deviation. A tendency for models to under-simulate the level of natural variability 
  would result in an underestimate of ensemble variance. There is also the possibility 
  of seriously flawed outliers in the ensemble corrupting the results. The ensemble 
  approach nevertheless represents one of the few methods currently available 
  for deriving information from the array of model results and it is used in this 
  chapter to characterise projections of future climate. </p>
<p>Missing or misrepresented physics: No attempt has been made to quantify the 
  uncertainty in model projections of climate change due to missing or misrepresented 
  physics. Current models attempt to include the dominant physical processes that 
  govern the behaviour and the response of the climate system to specified forcing 
  scenarios. Studies of "missing" processes are often carried out, for 
  instance of the effect of aerosols on cloud lifetimes, but until the results 
  are well-founded, of appreciable magnitude, and robust in a range of models, 
  they are considered to be studies of sensitivity rather than projections of 
  climate change. Physical processes which are misrepresented in one or more, 
  but not all, models will give rise to differences which will be reflected in 
  the ensemble standard deviation. </p>
<p>The impact of uncertainty due to missing or misrepresented processes can, however, 
  be limited by requiring model simulations to reproduce recent observed climate 
  change. To the extent that errors are linear (i.e., they have proportionally 
  the same impact on the past and future changes), it is argued in <a href="439.htm">Chapter 
  12</a>, <a href="462.htm">Section 12.4.3.3</a> that the observed record provides 
  a constraint on forecast anthropogenic warming rates over the coming decades 
  that does not depend on any specific model's climate sensitivity, rate 
  of ocean heat uptake and (under some scenarios) magnitude of sulphate forcing 
  and response.</p>
