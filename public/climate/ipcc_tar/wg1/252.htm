<h3>6.13.2 Limitations </h3>
<p>It is important that the global mean forcing estimates be interpreted in a 
  proper manner. Recall that the utility of the forcing concept is to afford a 
  first-order perspective into the relative climatic impacts (viz., global-mean 
  surface temperature change) of the different forcings. As stated in <a href="216.htm">Section 
  6.2</a>, for many of the relevant forcings (e.g., well-mixed greenhouse gases, 
  solar, certain aerosol and O<sub>3</sub> profile cases), model studies suggest a reasonable 
  similarity of the climate sensitivity factor (<a href="216.htm#equ61">Equation 
  6.1</a>), such that a comparison of these forcings is meaningful for assessing 
  their relative effects on the global mean surface temperature. However, as mentioned 
  earlier, the climate sensitivity factor for some of the spatially inhomogeneous 
  forcings has yet to be fully explored. For some of the forcings (e.g., involving 
  some absorbing aerosol and O<sub>3</sub> profile cases; see Hansen et al., 1997a), the 
  climate sensitivity is markedly different than for, say, the well-mixed greenhouse 
  gases, while, for other forcings (e.g., indirect aerosol effect), more comprehensive 
  studies are needed before a generalisation can become possible.</p>
<p>It is also cautioned that it may be inappropriate to perform a sum of the forcings 
  to derive a best estimate "total" radiative forcing. Such an operation 
  has the limitation that there are differing degrees of reliability of the global 
  mean estimates of the various forcings, which do not necessarily lend themselves 
  to a well-justified quantitative manipulation. For some forcings, there is not 
  even a central or best estimate given at present (e.g., indirect aerosol forcing), 
  essentially due to the substantial uncertainties.</p>
<p>The ranges given for the various forcings in <a href="245.htm#fig66">Figure 
  6.6</a>, as already pointed out, do not have a statistical basis and are guided 
  mostly by the estimates from published model studies. Performing mathematical 
  manipulations using these ranges to obtain a "net uncertainty range" 
  for the total forcing, therefore, lacks a rigorous basis. Adding to the complexity 
  is the fact that each forcing has associated with it an assessment of the level 
  of knowledge that is subjective in nature viz., LOSU (<a href="#tab612">Table 
  6.12</a>). The LOSU index is not a quantitative indicator and, at best, yields 
  a qualitative sense about the reliability of the estimates, with the well-mixed 
  greenhouse gases having the highest reliability, those with "medium" 
  rank having lesser reliability, and with even less reliability for the "low" 
  and "very low" rankings. To some extent, the relatively lower ranking 
  of the non-well-mixed greenhouse gases (e.g., aerosols, O<sub>3</sub>) is associated with 
  the fact that the forcing estimates for these agents depend on model simulations 
  of species' concentrations, in contrast to the well-mixed greenhouse gases 
  whose global concentrations are well quantified.</p>
<p>In a general sense, the strategy and usefulness of combining global mean estimates 
  of forcings that have different signs, spatial patterns, vertical structures, 
  uncertainties, and LOSUs, and the resulting significance in the context of the 
  global climate response are yet to be fully explored. For some combinations 
  of forcing agents (e.g., well-mixed greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosol; see 
  <a href="216.htm">Section 6.2</a>), it is apparent from model tests that the 
  global mean responses to the individual forcings can be added to yield the total 
  global mean response. Because linear additivity tests have yet to be performed 
  for the complete set of agents shown in <a href="245.htm#fig66">Figure 6.6</a>, 
  it is not possible to state with absolute certainty that the additivity concept 
  will necessarily hold for the entire set of forcings.</p>
<p><a href="245.htm#fig66">Figure 6.6</a> depicts the uncertainties and LOSUs 
  only for the global mean estimates. No attempt is made here to extend these 
  subjective characterisations to the spatial domains associated with each of 
  the forcings (see <a href="253.htm#fig67">Figure 6.7</a>, and <a href="251.htm#tab611">Table 
  6.11</a> for the Northern to Southern Hemisphere ratios). As in the SAR, we 
  reiterate that, in view of the spatial character of several of the forcing agents, 
  the global mean estimates do not necessarily describe the complete spatial (horizontal 
  and vertical dimensions) and seasonal climate responses to a particular radiative 
  perturbation. Nor do they yield quantitative information about changes in parameters 
  other than the global mean surface temperature response.</p>
<p>One diagnostic constraint on the total global mean forcing since pre-industrial 
  times is likely to be provided by comparisons of model-simulated (driven by 
  the combination of forcings) and observed climate changes, including spatially-based 
  detection-attribution analyses (<a href="439.htm">Chapter 12</a>). However, 
  the a posteriori inference involves a number of crucial assumptions, including 
  the uncertainties associated with the forcings, the representativeness of the 
  climate models' sensitivity to the forcings, and the model's representation 
  of the real world's "natural" variations.</p>
<p>Overall, the net forcing comprises of a large positive value due to well-mixed 
  greenhouse gases, followed by a number of other agents that have smaller positive 
  or negative values. Thus, relative to IPCC (1990) and over this past decade, 
  there are now more forcing agents to be accounted for, each with a sizeable 
  uncertainty that can affect the estimated climate response. In this regard, 
  consideration of the "newer" forcing agents brings on an additional 
  element of uncertainty in climate change analyses, over and above those concerning 
  climate feedbacks and natural variability (IPCC, 1990). Both the spatial character 
  of the forcing and doubts about the magnitudes (and, in some cases, even the 
  sign) add to the complexity of the climate change problem. However, this does 
  not necessarily imply that the uncertainty associated with the forcings is now 
  of much greater importance than the issue of climate sensitivity of models.</p>
