<h3>12.4.3 Optimal Fingerprint Methods </h3>
<p>The use of "optimal" techniques can increase the detectability of 
  forced climate changes. These techniques increase the signal-to-noise ratio 
  by looking at the component of the response away from the direction of highest 
  internal variability (see, e.g., Hasselmann, 1979, 1997, 1993; North et al., 
  1995; see also <a href="456.htm#box121">Box 12.1</a> on optimal detection and 
  <a href="468.htm">Appendix 12.1</a>). Several new approaches to the optimal 
  detection of anthropogenic climate change have been undertaken since the SAR. 
  We focus on optimal detection studies that use a single pattern of climate change 
  in the following section. Attribution (see <a href="443.htm#1211">Section 12.1.1</a>), 
  which requires us to consider several signals simultaneously, will be considered 
  in <a href="461.htm">Sections 12.4.3.2</a> and <a href="462.htm">12.4.3.3</a>. 
</p>
<h4><a name="12431"></a>12.4.3.1 Single pattern studies</h4>
<p>Since the SAR, optimal detection studies of surface temperature have been extended 
  (Hegerl et al., 1997, 2000; Barnett et al., 1999) and new studies of data other 
  than surface air temperature have been conducted (Allen and Tett, 1999; Paeth 
  and Hense, 2001; Tett et al., 2000).</p>
<p><i>Surface temperature patterns</i><br>
  The Hegerl et al. (1996) optimal detection study was extended to include more 
  recent estimates of internal variability and simulations with a representation 
  of sulphate aerosols (Hegerl et al., 1997). As in the previous study, different 
  control simulations were used to determine the optimal fingerprint and the significance 
  level of recent temperature change. The authors find significant evidence for 
  a "greenhouse gas plus sulphate aerosol" (GS) fingerprint in the most 
  recent observed 30-year temperature trends regardless of whether internal variability 
  is estimated from models or observations. The 30-year trend ending in the 1940s 
  was found to be significantly larger than expected from internal variability, 
  but less so than the more recent trends. This work has been extended to include 
  other models (<a href="#fig1210">Figure 12.10a</a>; see also Barnett et al., 
  1999: Hegerl et al., 2000), examining whether the amplitude of the 50-year summer 
  surface temperature trends in the GS simulations is consistent with that estimated 
  in the observations. In eleven out of fourteen cases (seven models each evaluated 
  using the fingerprints from the two original models), the model trends are consistent 
  with observations. The greenhouse gas only simulations are generally not consistent 
  with observations, as their warming trends are too large. Berliner et al. (2000) 
  detect a combined greenhouse gas and sulphate signal in a fixed pattern detection 
  study of temperature changes using Bayesian techniques.</p>

      <p><b>Figure 12.10:</b> Comparison between the amplitude of anthropogenic 
        signals from observed and modelled JJA trend patterns using fingerprints 
        from two different climate models (ECHAM3/LSG and HadCM2) and data from 
        five climate models. (a) Comparison of the amplitude of a single greenhouse 
        gas + sulphate aerosol (GS) signal (expressed as change in global mean 
        temperature [&deg;C] over 50 years). Results show that a significant GS 
        signal can be detected in observed trend patterns 1949 to 1998 at a 5% 
        significance level (one-sided test), independent of which pair of fingerprints 
        was used. The observed signal amplitude is consistent with contemporaneous 
        GS amplitudes for most models' GS simulations. 90% confidence intervals 
        are shown by solid lines for estimates using ECHAM3/LSG fingerprints and 
        by dashed lines for estimates based on HadCM2 fingerprints. Cases where 
        a model's and the observed amplitude disagree are marked by a cross 
        on the axis. (b) and (c) show an estimate of the observed amplitude of 
        a greenhouse gas signal (horizontal axis) and a sulphate aerosol signal 
        (vertical axis) estimated simultaneously. Both signal amplitudes can be 
        estimated as positive from observations based on ECHAM3/LSG fingerprints 
        shown in (b) while only the greenhouse gas signal is detected based on 
        HadCM2 fingerprints shown in panel (c). The amplitudes of both signals 
        from the observations are compared with those from model simulations forced 
        with various forcing histories and using different climate models (1: 
        HadCM2; 2: ECHAM3/LSG; 3: GFDL; 4: ECHAM4/OPYC; 5: CCCma1; 6: CCCma2). 
        Simulations with symbols shown in black are consistent with observations 
        relative to the uncertainty in observations (grey ellipse) and that of 
        the model simulations (not shown). Simulations which are inconsistent 
        are shown in grey. Model simulations where only a single ensemble member 
        is available are illustrated by thin symbols, those based on ensembles 
        of simulations by fat symbols.<br>
        Results from consistency tests indicate that most greenhouse gas only 
        simulations (G, shown by &quot;x&quot;) are inconsistent with observations. 
        Ten of the GS simulations in both panels are in agreement with observed 
        trend patterns, discrepancies arise mostly from the magnitude of a sulphate 
        signal (vertical axis). The failure to detect a sulphate signal as well 
        as a greenhouse gas signal in panel (c) is due to the two signals being 
        very highly correlated if only spatial patterns are used- this makes separation 
        of the signals difficult. These results show that estimates of a sulphate 
        aerosol signal from observations are model dependent and quite uncertain, 
        while a single anthropogenic signal can be estimated with more confidence.<br>
        All units are in &deg;C/50 year, values in the upper right quadrant refer 
        to a physically meaningful greenhouse warming and sulphate aerosol cooling 
        signal. The consistency test establishes whether the difference between 
        a model's and the observed amplitude estimate is significantly larger 
        than the combined uncertainty in the observations (internal variability 
        + observational uncertainty) and the model simulation (internal variability). 
        The figure is derived by updating the data used by Barnett et al. (1999) 
        (for details of the analysis see Hegerl et al., 2000) and then applying 
        a simple linear transformation of the multi-regression results (Hegerl 
        and Allen, 2000).<br>
        Results for 1946 to 1995 period used by Barnett et al. (1999) are similar, 
        except fewer of the models in b and c agree with observations and the 
        case of both signals being zero in c is not rejected. Simulations of natural 
        forcing only ending before 1998 are also rejected in that case. </p>

<p><i>Vertical patterns of temperature</i><br>
  Allen and Tett (1999) use optimal detection methods to study the change in the 
  vertical profile of zonal mean temperature between 1961 to 1980 and 1986 to 
  1995. Estimated signals from ensemble AOGCM simulations with greenhouse gas 
  alone (G), greenhouse gas plus direct sulphate (GS), and also including stratospheric 
  ozone forcing (GSO; Tett et al., 1996) are considered. The G and GSO signals 
  are detected separately. The amplitude of the GSO fingerprint estimated from 
  observations is found to be consistent with that simulated by the model, while 
  the model-simulated response to greenhouse gases alone was found to be unrealistically 
  strong. The variance of the residuals that remain after the estimated signal 
  is removed from the observations is consistent with internal variability estimated 
  from a control run. </p>
<p><i>Other climatic variables</i><br>
  Schnur (2001) applied the optimal detection technique to trends in a variety 
  of climate diagnostics. Changes in the annual mean surface temperature were 
  found to be highly significant (in agreement with previous results from Hegerl 
  et al., 1996, 1997). The predicted change in the annual cycle of temperature 
  as well as winter means of diurnal temperature range can also be detected in 
  most recent observations. The changes are most consistent with those expected 
  from increasing greenhouse gases and aerosols. However, changes in the annual 
  mean and annual cycle of precipitation were small and not significant. </p>
<p>Paeth and Hense (2001) applied a correlation method related to the optimal 
  fingerprint method to 20-year trends of lower tropospheric mean temperature 
  (between 500 and 1,000 hPa) in the summer half of the year in the Northern Hemisphere 
  north of 55&deg;N. Greenhouse gas fingerprints from two models were detected. 
  The combined greenhouse gas plus (direct) sulphate (GS) fingerprints from the 
  two models were not detected. </p>
<p><i>Summary</i><br>
  All new single-pattern studies published since the SAR detect anthropogenic 
  fingerprints in the global temperature observations, both at the surface and 
  aloft. The signal amplitudes estimated from observations and modelled amplitudes 
  are consistent at the surface if greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol forcing 
  are taken into account, and in the free atmosphere if ozone forcing is also 
  included. Fingerprints based on smaller areas or on other variables yield more 
  ambiguous results at present.</p>
