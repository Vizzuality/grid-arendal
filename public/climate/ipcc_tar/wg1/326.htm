<p><a name="fig815"></a>Since the pioneer experiments conducted at the Hadley 
  Centre for Climate Prediction and Research (Mitchell et al. 1995) and at the 
  Deutsche Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ) (Hasselmann et al. 1995), reported in the 
  SAR, a number of other groups internationally have reproduced the trend in the 
  surface air temperature instrumental record over the 20th century. These include 
  the Canadian Center for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) (Boer et al. 
  2000), Centre for Climate System Research/National Institute for Environmental 
  Studies (CCSR/NIES) (Emori et al. 1999), Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial 
  Research Organization (CSIRO), Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) 
  (Haywood et al. 1997) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) 
  (Meehl et al. 2000b). Many of these new contributions, including recent experiments 
  at the Hadley Centre and DKRZ, include an ensemble of projections over the 20th 
  century (e.g., <a href="#fig815">Figure 8.15</a>). Such an ensemble allows for 
  an estimate of intra-model variability, which in the case of the CCCma model 
  (<a href="#fig815">Figure 8.15</a>), is larger than the possible anthropogenic 
  signal through the early part of the 20th century (cf., inter-model variability 
  shown in <a href="348.htm#fig93">Figure 9.3</a>).</p>
<p>Coupled models that have been used to simulate changes over the 20th century 
  have all started with "control model" levels of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (typically 
  330 ppm). This initial condition is then referred to as the "pre-industrial" 
  initial condition. Changes in radiative forcing are then calculated by taking 
  the observed atmospheric equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> level over the 20th century as a difference 
  relative to the actual pre-industrial level (280 ppm), and adding this as a 
  perturbation to the control model levels. Implicit in this approach is the assumption 
  that the climate system responds linearly to small perturbations away from the 
  present climate. Haywood et al. (1997) demonstrated the near linear response 
  of the GFDL-coupled model to changes in radiative forcing associated with increases 
  in atmospheric greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols. When added together, 
  experiments which included aerosol and greenhouse gas increases separately over 
  the 20th century yielded a similar transient response (in terms of globally 
  averaged and geographical distribution of surface air temperature and precipitation) 
  to an experiment which included both aerosol and greenhouse gas increases. This 
  analysis is particularly important as it validates the methodological approach 
  used in coupled model simulations of the 20th century climate.</p>
<p>As noted in the SAR, the inclusion of the direct effect of sulphate aerosols 
  is important since the radiative forcing associated with 20th century greenhouse 
  gas increase alone tends to overestimate the 20th century warming in most models. 
  Groups that have included a representation of the direct effects of sulphate 
  aerosols have found that their model generally reproduces the observed trend 
  in the instrumental surface air temperature warming, thereby suggesting that 
  their combination of model climate sensitivity and oceanic heat uptake is not 
  unrealistic (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="344.htm#921">Section 
  9.2.1</a> and <a href="350.htm#fig97">Figure 9.7</a>). These same models have 
  more difficulty representing variability observed within the 20th century instrumental 
  record (<a href="327.htm">Sections 8.6.2</a>, <a href="328.htm">8.6.3</a>). 
  As mentioned in <a href="328.htm">Section 8.6.3</a>, some modelling studies 
  suggest that the inclusion of additional forcings from solar variability and 
  volcanic aerosols may improve aspects of this simulated variability. Delworth 
  and Knutson (2000), on the other hand, note that one of their six 20th century 
  integrations (using GFDL_R30_c) bears a striking resemblance to the observed 
  20th century warming which occurs primarily in two distinct periods (from 1925 
  to 1944 and from 1978 to the present), without the need for additional external 
  forcing. In addition, all coupled models have shown a trend towards increasing 
  global precipitation, with an intensification of the signal at the high northern 
  latitudes, consistent with the observational record (<a href="#fig816">Figure 
  8.16</a>). Nevertheless, AOGCM simulations have yet to be systematically analysed 
  for the occurrence of other key observed trends, such as the reduction in diurnal 
  temperature range over the 20th century and the associated increase in cloud 
  coverage.</p>
<p>The aforementioned studies all prescribed the temporal and geographical distribution 
  of sulphate aerosols and included their radiative effects by perturbing the 
  surface albedo according to the amount of sulphate loading in the atmospheric 
  column above the surface (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>, <a href="231.htm#67">Sections 
  6.7</a>, <a href="238.htm">6.8</a> and <a href="253.htm">6.14</a>). This approach 
  both ignores the indirect effect of these aerosols (i.e., their effects on cloud 
  formation) as well as weather affects on aerosol redistribution and removal. 
  Roeckner et al. (1999) made a major step forward by incorporating a sulphur 
  cycle model into the ECHAM4(ECMWF/MPI AGCM)/OPYC3(Ocean isoPYCnal GCM) AOGCM 
  to eliminate these shortcomings. In addition, they included the radiative forcing 
  due to anthropogenic changes in tropospheric ozone by prescribing ozone levels 
  obtained from an offline tropospheric chemistry model coupled to ECHAM4. The 
  simulation of the 20th century climate obtained from this model (Bengtsson et 
  al. 1999), which includes the indirect effect of aerosols, shows a good agreement 
  with the general 20th century trend in warming (see <a href="439.htm">Chapter 
  12</a>, <a href="462.htm">Section 12.4.3.3</a>). The results of this study also 
  suggest that the agreement between model and observed 20th century warming trends, 
  achieved without the inclusion of the indirect aerosol effect, was probably 
  accomplished with an overestimated direct effect or an overestimated transient 
  oceanic heat uptake. Alternatively, since these studies include only idealised 
  scenarios of sulphate radiative forcing alone (direct and/or indirect) that 
  do not include the apparent effects of other aerosol types (<a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>), one might view the sulphate treatment as a surrogate, albeit with large 
  uncertainty, for the radiative forcing associated with all anthropogenic aerosols.</p>
<p>As noted in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="052.htm#222">Sections 
  2.2.2</a> and <a href="059.htm">2.2.3</a>, land surface temperatures show a 
  greater rate of warming than do lower tropospheric air temperatures over the 
  last 20 years (see also discussion in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="060.htm">Section 
  2.2.4</a>). While noting uncertainties in the observational records (<a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>, <a href="052.htm#222">Sections 2.2.2</a> and <a href="059.htm">2.2.3</a>), 
  the National Research Council (NRC) (2000) pointed out that models, which tend 
  not to show such a differential trend, need to better capture the vertical and 
  temporal profiles of the radiative forcing especially associated with water 
  vapour and tropospheric and stratospheric ozone and aerosols, and the effects 
  of the latter on clouds. Santer et al. (2000) provide further evidence to support 
  this notion from integrations conducted with the ECHAM4/OPYC3 AOGCM (Bengtsson 
  et al. 1999; Roeckner et al., 1999) that includes a representation of the direct 
  and indirect effects of sulphate aerosols, as well as changes in tropospheric 
  ozone. They showed that the further inclusion of stratospheric ozone depletion 
  and stratospheric aerosols associated with the Pinatubo eruption lead to a better 
  agreement with observed tropospheric temperature changes since 1979, although 
  discrepancies still remain (see <a href="439.htm">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="454.htm#1232">Section 
  12.3.2</a> and <a href="449.htm#fig124">Figure 12.4</a>).</p>
