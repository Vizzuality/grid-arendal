<h3><a name="323"></a>3.2.3 Ocean Carbon Processes </h3>
<h4><a name="3231"></a>3.2.3.1 Background</h4>
<p>The total amount of carbon in the ocean is about 50 times greater than the 
  amount in the atmosphere, and is exchanged with the atmosphere on a time-scale 
  of several hundred years. Dissolution in the oceans provides a large sink for 
  anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>, due in part to its high solubility, but above 
  all because of its dissociation into ions and interactions with sea water constituents 
  (see <a href="#box33">Box 3.3</a>).</p>
<p><a name="box33"></a> </p>
<table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td class="box"> 
      <div align="center"><b>Box 3.3: The varying CO<sub>2</sub> uptake capacity 
        of the ocean.</b> </div>
      <p>Because of its solubility and chemical reactivity, CO<sub>2</sub> is 
        taken up by the ocean much more effectively than other anthropogenic gases 
        (e.g., chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and CH<sub>4</sub>). CO<sub>2</sub> 
        that dissolves in seawater is found in three main forms. The sum of these 
        forms constitutes dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The three forms are: 
        (1) dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> (non-ionic, about 1% of the total) which 
        can be exchanged with the atmosphere until the partial pressure in surface 
        water and air are equal, (2) bicarbonate ion (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, 
        about 91%); and (3) carbonate ion (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, 
        about 8%). As atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increases, the dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> 
        content of surface seawater increases at a similar rate, but most of the 
        added CO<sub>2</sub> ends up as HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Meanwhile, 
        the CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> content decreases, since the net effect 
        of adding CO<sub>2</sub> is a reaction with CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> 
        to form HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (<a href="097.htm#fig31">Figure 3.1</a>). 
        There is therefore less available CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> to react 
        with further CO<sub>2</sub> additions, causing an increasing proportion 
        of the added CO<sub>2</sub> to remain in its dissolved form. This restricts 
        further uptake, so that the overall ability of surface sea water to take 
        up CO<sub>2</sub> decreases at higher atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. 
        The effect is large. For a 100 ppm increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
        above today's level (i.e., from 370 to 470 ppm) the DIC concentration 
        increase of surface sea water is already about 40% smaller than would 
        have been caused by a similar 100 ppm increase relative to pre-industrial 
        levels (i.e., from 280 to 380 ppm). The contemporary DIC increase is about 
        60% greater than would result if atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> were to increase 
        from 750 to 850 ppm. </p>
      <p>The uptake capacity for CO<sub>2</sub> also varies significantly due 
        to additional factors, most importantly seawater temperature, salinity 
        and alkalinity (the latter being a measurable quantity approximately equal 
        to [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] + 2 x[CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>]). 
        Alkalinity is influenced primarily by the cycle of CaCO<sub>3</sub> formation 
        (in shells and corals) and dissolution (see <a href="097.htm#fig31">Figure 
        3.1c</a>).</p>

<p>The annual two-way gross exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> between the atmosphere 
  and surface ocean is about 90 PgC/yr, mediated by molecular diffusion across 
  the air-sea interface. Net CO<sub>2</sub> transfer can occur whenever there 
  is a partial pressure difference of CO<sub>2</sub> across this interface. The 
  flux can be estimated as the product of a gas transfer coefficient, the solubility 
  of CO<sub>2</sub>, and the partial pressure difference of CO<sub>2</sub> between 
  air and water. The gas transfer coefficient incorporates effects of many physical 
  factors but is usually expressed as a non-linear function of wind speed alone. 
  There is considerable uncertainty about this function (Liss and Merlivat, 1986; 
  Wanninkhof, 1992; Watson et al., 1995). Improvements in the ability to measure 
  CO<sub>2</sub> transfer directly e.g., Wanninkhof and McGillis, 1999) may lead 
  to a better knowledge of gas transfer coefficients.</p>
<p>Despite extensive global measurements conducted during the 1990s, measurements 
  of surface water <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> remain sparse, and extensive spatial 
  and temporal interpolation is required in order to produce global fields. Takahashi 
  et al. (1999) interpolated data collected over three decades in order to derive 
  monthly values of surface water <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> over the globe for a 
  single "virtual" calendar year (1995). A wind speed dependent gas 
  transfer coefficient was used to calculate monthly net CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes. 
  The resulting estimates, although subject to large uncertainty, revealed clear 
  regional and seasonal patterns in net fluxes.</p>
<p>Regional net CO<sub>2</sub> transfers estimated from contemporary surface water 
  <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> data should not be confused with the uptake of anthropogenic 
  CO<sub>2</sub>. The uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> is the increase in 
  net transfer over the pre-industrial net transfer, and is therefore superimposed 
  on a globally varying pattern of relatively large natural transfers. The natural 
  transfers result from heating and cooling, and biological production and respiration. 
  Carbon is transferred within the ocean from natural sink regions to natural 
  source regions via ocean circulation and the sinking of carbon rich particles. 
  This spatial separation of natural sources and sinks dominates the regional 
  distribution of net annual air-sea fluxes.</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> solubility is temperature dependent, hence air-sea heat transfer 
  contributes to seasonal and regional patterns of air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> transfer 
  (Watson et al., 1995). Net cooling of surface waters tends to drive CO<sub>2</sub> 
  uptake; net warming drives outgassing. Regions of cooling and heating are linked 
  via circulation, producing vertical gradients and north-south transports of 
  carbon within the ocean (e.g., of the order 0.5 to 1 PgC/yr southward transport 
  in the Atlantic Basin; Broecker and Peng, 1992; Keeling and Peng, 1995; Watson 
  et al., 1995; Holfort et al., 1998). </p>
<p>Biological processes also drive seasonal and regional distributions of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  fluxes (<a href="097.htm#fig31">Figure 1c</a>). The gross primary production 
  by ocean phytoplankton has been estimated by Bender et al. (1994) to be 103 
  PgC/yr. Part of this is returned to DIC through autotrophic respiration, with 
  the remainder being net primary production, estimated on the basis of global 
  remote sensing data to be about 45 PgC/yr (Longhurst et al., 1995; Antoine et 
  al., 1996; Falkowski et al., 1998; Field et al., 1998; Balkanski et al., 1999). 
  About 14 to 30% of the total NPP occurs in coastal areas (Gattuso et al., 1998). 
  The resulting organic carbon is consumed by zooplankton (a quantitatively more 
  important process than herbivory on land) or becomes detritus. Some organic 
  carbon is released in dissolved form (DOC) and oxidised by bacteria (Ducklow, 
  1999) with a fraction entering the ocean reservoir as net DOC production (Hansell 
  and Carlson, 1998). Sinking of particulate organic carbon (POC) composed of 
  dead organisms and detritus together with vertical transfer of DOC create a 
  downward flux of organic carbon from the upper ocean known as "export production". 
  Recent estimates for global export production range from roughly 10 to 20 PgC/yr 
  (Falkowski et al., 1998; Laws et al., 2000). An alternative estimate for global 
  export production of 11 PgC/yr has been derived using an inverse model of physical 
  and chemical data from the world's oceans (Schlitzer, 2000). Only a small 
  fraction (about 0.1 PgC) of the export production sinks in sediments, mostly 
  in the coastal ocean (Gattuso et al., 1998). Heterotrophic respiration at depth 
  converts the remaining organic carbon back to DIC. Eventually, and usually at 
  another location, this DIC is upwelled into the ocean's surface layer again 
  and may re-equilibrate with the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. These mechanisms, 
  often referred to as the biological pump, maintain higher DIC concentrations 
  at depth and cause atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations to be about 200 
  ppm lower than would be the case in the absence of such mechanisms (Sarmiento 
  and Toggweiler, 1984; Maier-Reimer et al., 1996).</p>
<p>Marine organisms also form shells of solid calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) 
  that sink vertically or accumulate in sediments, coral reefs and sands. This 
  process depletes surface CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, reduces alkalinity, 
  and tends to increase <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and drive more outgassing of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  (see <a href="#box33">Box 3.3</a> and <a href="097.htm#fig31">Figure 3.1</a>). 
  The effect of CaCO<sub>3</sub> formation on surface water <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and air-sea fluxes is therefore counter to the effect of organic carbon production. 
  For the surface ocean globally, the ratio between the export of organic carbon 
  and the export of calcium carbonate (the "rain ratio") is a critical 
  factor controlling the overall effect of biological activity on surface ocean 
  <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href="097.htm#fig31">Figure 3.1</a>; Archer and Maier-Reimer, 
  1994). Milliman (1993) estimated a global production of CaCO<sub>3</sub> of 
  0.7 PgC/yr, with roughly equivalent amounts produced in shallow water and surface 
  waters of the deep ocean. Of this total, approximately 60% accumulates in sediments. 
  The rest re-dissolves either in the water column or within the sediment. An 
  estimate of CaCO<sub>3</sub> flux analogous to the export production of organic 
  carbon, however, should include sinking out of the upper layers of the open 
  ocean, net accumulation in shallow sediments and reefs, and export of material 
  from shallow systems into deep sea environments. Based on Milliman's (1993) 
  budget, this quantity is about 0.6 PgC/yr (&plusmn; 25 to 50 % at least). The 
  global average rain ratio has been variously estimated from models of varying 
  complexity to be 4 (Broecker and Peng, 1982), 3.5 to 7.5 (Shaffer, 1993), and 
  11 (Yamanaka and Tajika, 1996). (It should be noted that rain ratios are highly 
  depth dependent due to rapid oxidation of organic carbon at shallow depth compared 
  to the depths at which sinking CaCO<sub>3</sub> starts to dissolve.) If one 
  accepts an organic carbon export production value of 11 PgC/yr (Schlitzer, 2000), 
  then only Yamanaka and Tajika's (1996) value for the rain ratio approaches 
  consistency with the observation-based estimates of the export of CaCO<sub>3</sub> 
  and organic carbon from the ocean surface layer.</p>
<p>The overall productivity of the ocean is determined largely by nutrient supply 
  from deep water. There are multiple potentially limiting nutrients: in practice 
  nitrate and/or phosphate are commonly limiting (Falkowski et al., 1998; Tyrell, 
  1999). Silicate plays a role in limiting specific types of phytoplankton and 
  hence in determining the qualitative nature of primary production, and potentially 
  the depth to which organic carbon sinks. A role for iron in limiting primary 
  productivity in regions with detectable phosphate and nitrate but low productivity 
  (HNLC or "high nutrient, low chlorophyll regions") has been experimentally 
  demonstrated in the equatorial Pacific (Coale et al., 1996) and the Southern 
  Ocean (Boyd et al., 2000). In both regions artificial addition of iron stimulated 
  phytoplankton growth, resulting in decreased surface-water <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>. 
  In HLNC regions, the supply of iron from deep water, while an important source, 
  is generally insufficient to meet the requirements of phytoplankton. An important 
  additional supply of iron to surface waters far removed from sediment and riverine 
  sources is aeolian transport and deposition (Duce and Tindale, 1991; Fung et 
  al., 2000; Martin, 1990). This aeolian supply of iron may limit primary production 
  in HNLC regions, although the effect is ultimately constrained by the availability 
  of nitrate and phosphate. Iron has been hypothesised to play an indirect role 
  over longer time-scales (e.g., glacial-interglacial) through limitation of oceanic 
  nitrogen fixation and, consequently, the oceanic content of nitrate (Falkowski 
  et al., 1998; Broecker and Henderson, 1998; <a href="106.htm#box34">Box 3.4</a>). 
  The regional variability of oceanic nitrogen fixation (Gruber and Sarmiento, 
  1997) and its temporal variability and potential climate-sensitivity have recently 
  become apparent based on results from long time-series and global surveys (Karl 
  et al., 1997; Hansell and Feely, 2000).</p>
<p>Carbon (organic and inorganic) derived from land also enters the ocean via 
  rivers as well as to some extent via groundwater. This transport comprises a 
  natural carbon transport together with a significant anthropogenic perturbation. 
  The global natural transport from rivers to the ocean is about 0.8 PgC/yr, half 
  of which is organic and half inorganic (Meybeck 1982, 1993; Sarmiento and Sundquist 
  1992; <a href="097.htm#fig31">Figure 3.1</a>). Additional fluxes due to human 
  activity have been estimated (Meybeck, 1993) to be about 0.1 PgC/yr (mainly 
  organic carbon). Much of the organic carbon is deposited and/or respired and 
  outgassed close to land, mostly within estuaries (Smith and Hollibaugh, 1993).The 
  outgassing of anthropogenic carbon from estuaries can be a significant term 
  in comparison with regional CO<sub>2</sub> emissions estimates (e.g., 5 to 10% 
  for Western Europe; Frankignoulle et al., 1998). The natural DIC transport via 
  rivers, however, is part of a large-scale cycling of carbon between the open 
  ocean and land associated with dissolution and precipitation of carbonate minerals. 
  This natural cycle drives net outgassing from the ocean of the order 0.6 PgC/yr 
  globally, which should be included in any assessment of net air-sea and atmosphere-terrestrial 
  biosphere transfers (Sarmiento and Sundquist, 1992) and ocean transports (e.g., 
  Holfort et al., 1998).</p>
