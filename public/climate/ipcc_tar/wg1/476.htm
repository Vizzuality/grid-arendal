<h2>13.1 Introduction </h2>
<h3><a name="1311"></a>13.1.1 Definition and Nature of Scenarios</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this report, a climate scenario refers to a plausible future 
  climate that has been constructed for explicit use in investigating the potential 
  consequences of anthropogenic climate change. Such climate scenarios should 
  represent future conditions that account for both human-induced climate change 
  and natural climate variability. We distinguish a climate scenario from a climate 
  projection (discussed in <a href="338.htm">Chapters 9</a> and <a href="373.htm">10</a>), 
  which refers to a description of the response of the climate system to a scenario 
  of greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions, as simulated by a climate model. Climate 
  projections alone rarely provide sufficient information to estimate future impacts 
  of climate change; model outputs commonly have to be manipulated and combined 
  with observed climate data to be usable, for example, as inputs to impact models.</p>
<p>To further illustrate this point, <a href="#box131">Box 13.1</a> presents a 
  simple example of climate scenario construction based on climate projections. 
  The example also illustrates some other common considerations in performing 
  an impact assessment that touch on issues discussed later in this chapter.</p>

      <p>Example of basic scenario construction for an impact study: the case 
        of climate change and world food supply (Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994).</p>
      <p><b>Aim of the study</b><br>
        The objective of this study was to estimate how global food supply might 
        be affected by greenhouse gas induced climate change up to the year 2060. 
        The method adopted involved estimating the change in yield of major crop 
        staples under various scenarios using crop models at 112 representative 
        sites distributed across the major agricultural regions of the world. 
        Yield change estimates were assumed to be applicable to large regions 
        to produce estimates of changes in total production which were then input 
        to a global trade model. Using assumptions about future population, economic 
        growth, trading conditions and technological progress, the trade model 
        estimated plausible prices of food commodities on the international market 
        given supply as defined by the production estimates. This information 
        was then used to define the number of people at risk from hunger in developing 
        countries.</p>
      <p><b>Scenario information</b><br>
        Each of the stages of analysis required scenario information to be provided, 
        including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>scenarios of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration, affecting crop growth 
          and water use, as an input to the crop models;</li>
        <li>climate observations and scenarios of future climate, for the crop 
          model simulations;</li>
        <li>adaptation scenarios (e.g., new crop varieties, adjusted farm management) 
          as inputs to the crop models;</li>
        <li>scenarios of regional population and global trading policy as an input 
          to the trade model.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To the extent possible, the scenarios were mutually consistent, such 
        that scenarios of population (United Nations medium range estimate) and 
        Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (moderate growth) were broadly in line with 
        the transient scenario of greenhouse gas emissions (based on the Goddard 
        Institute for Space Studies (GISS) scenario A, see Hansen et al., 1988), 
        and hence CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Similarly, the climate scenarios were based 
        on 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium GCM projections from three models, where the 
        radiative forcing of climate was interpreted as the combined concentrations 
        of CO<sub>2</sub> (555 ppm) and other greenhouse gases (contributing about 15% of 
        the change in forcing) equivalent to a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>, assumed to occur 
        in about 2060.</p>
      <p><b>Construction of the climate scenario</b><br>
        Since projections of current (and hence future) regional climate from 
        the GCM simulations were not accurate enough to be used directly as an 
        input to the crop model, modelled changes in climate were applied as adjustments 
        to the observed climate at a location. Climate change by 2060 was computed 
        as the difference (air temperature) or ratio (precipitation and solar 
        radiation) of monthly mean climate between the GCM (unforced) control 
        and 2xCO<sub>2</sub> simulations at GCM grid boxes coinciding with the crop 
        modelling sites (<a href="#fig131">Figure 13.1b</a>). These estimates 
        were used to adjust observed time-series of daily climate for the baseline 
        period (usually 1961 to 1990) at each site (<a href="#fig131">Figure 13.1b,c</a>). 
        Crop model simulations were conducted for the baseline climate and for 
        each of the three climate scenarios, with and without CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (to 
        estimate the relative contributions of CO<sub>2</sub> and climate to crop yield changes), 
        and assuming different levels of adaptation capacity.</p>

<p><a name="fig131"></a>We also distinguish between a climate scenario and a climate 
  change scenario. The latter term is sometimes used in the scientific literature 
  to denote a plausible future climate. However, this term should strictly refer 
  to a representation of the difference between some plausible future climate 
  and the current or control climate (usually as represented in a climate model) 
  (see <a href="#box131">Box 13.1</a>, <a href="#fig131">Figure 13.1a</a>). A 
  climate change scenario can be viewed as an interim step toward constructing 
  a climate scenario. Usually a climate scenario requires combining the climate 
  change scenario with a description of the current climate as represented by 
  climate observations (<a href="#fig131">Figure 13.1b</a>). In a climate impacts 
  context, it is the contrasting effects of these two climates - one current 
  (the observed "baseline" climate), one future (the climate scenario) on the exposure unit<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn13.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a> that determines the impact of the climate change 
  (<a href="#fig131">Figure 13.1c</a>).</p>
<p>A treatment of climate scenario development, in this specific sense, has been 
  largely absent in the earlier IPCC Assessment Reports. The subject has been 
  presented in independent IPCC Technical Guidelines documents (IPCC, 1992, 1994), 
  which were briefly summarised in the Second Assessment Report of Working Group 
  II (Carter et al., 1996b). These documents, while serving a useful purpose in 
  providing guidelines for scenario use, did not fully address the science of 
  climate scenario development. This may be, in part, because the field has been 
  slow to develop and because only recently has a critical mass of important research 
  issues coalesced and matured such that a full chapter is now warranted. </p>
<p>The chapter also serves as a bridge between this Report of Working Group I 
  and the IPCC <a href="../wg2/index.htm">Third Assessment Report of Working Group II</a> 
  (IPCC, 2001) (hereafter <a href="../wg2/index.htm">TAR WG II</a>) of climate change impacts, 
  adaptation and vulnerability. As such it also embodies the maturation in the 
  IPCC assessment process - that is, a recognition of the interconnections 
  among the different segments of the assessment process and a desire to further 
  integrate these segments. <a href="095.htm">Chapter 3</a> performs a similar 
  role in the <a href="../wg2/index.htm">TAR WG II</a> (Carter and La Rovere, 2001) also 
  discussing climate scenarios, but treating, in addition, all other scenarios 
  (socio-economic, land use, environmental, etc.) needed for undertaking policy-relevant 
  impact assessment. <a href="095.htm">Chapter 3</a> serves in part as the other 
  half of the bridge between the two Working Group Reports.</p>
<p>Scenarios are neither predictions nor forecasts of future conditions. Rather 
  they describe alternative plausible futures that conform to sets of circumstances 
  or constraints within which they occur (Hammond, 1996). The true purpose of 
  scenarios is to illuminate uncertainty, as they help in determining the possible 
  ramifications of an issue (in this case, climate change) along one or more plausible 
  (but indeterminate) paths (Fisher, 1996). </p>
<p>Not all possibly imaginable futures can be considered viable scenarios of future 
  climate. For example, most climate scenarios include the characteristic of increased 
  lower tropospheric temperature (except in some isolated regions and physical 
  circumstances), since most climatologists have very high confidence in that 
  characteristic (Schneider et al., 1990; Mahlman, 1997). Given our present state 
  of knowledge, a scenario that portrayed global tropospheric cooling for the 
  21st century would not be viable. We shall see in this chapter that what constitutes 
  a viable scenario of future climate has evolved along with our understanding 
  of the climate system and how this understanding might develop in the future.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the development of climate scenarios predates the issue 
  of global warming. In the mid-1970s, for example, when a concern emerged regarding 
  global cooling due to the possible effect of aircraft on the stratosphere, simple 
  incremental scenarios of climate change were formulated to evaluate what the 
  possible effects might be worldwide (CIAP, 1975).</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to assess the current state of climate scenario 
  development. It discusses research issues that are addressed by researchers 
  who develop climate scenarios and that must be considered by impacts researchers 
  when they select scenarios for use in impact assessments. This chapter is not 
  concerned, however, with presenting a comprehensive set of climate scenarios 
  for the IPCC Third Assessment Report.</p>
