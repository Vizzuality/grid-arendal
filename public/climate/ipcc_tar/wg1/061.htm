<h3><a name="225"></a>2.2.5 Changes in the Cryosphere </h3>
<p>This chapter does not describe changes in the major ice sheets as this is dealt 
  with in detail in <a href="408.htm">Chapter 11</a>. </p>
<h4><a name="2251"></a>2.2.5.1 Snow cover, including snowfall</h4>
<p>Satellite records indicate that the Northern Hemisphere annual snow-cover extent 
  (SCE) has decreased by about 10% since 1966 largely due to decreases in spring 
  and summer since the mid-1980s over both the Eurasian and American continents 
  (<a href="#fig213">Figure 2.13a</a>; Robinson, 1997, 1999). Winter and 
  autumn SCE show no statistically significant change. Reduction in snow cover 
  during the mid- to late 1980s was strongly related to temperature increases 
  in snow covered areas (<a href="#fig213">Figure 2.13b</a>). There is 
  a highly significant interannual (+0.6) and multi-decadal correlation between 
  increases in the Northern Hemisphere spring land temperature and a reduction 
  in the Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover since data have been available 
  (1966). Snow cover extent has decreased about 10% since 1966. The improvements 
  in the quantity and quality of the visible satellite imagery used to produce 
  the operational snow-cover product cannot account for the observed changes in 
  snow cover.</p>
<p>Longer regional time-series based on station records and reconstructions suggest 
  that Northern Hemisphere spring and summer SCEs in the past decade have been 
  at their lowest values in the past 100 years. In the other seasons, it is likely 
  that extents in the latter portion of the 20th century exceeded those of earlier 
  years (Brown, 2000).</p>
<p>Reconstructions for North America suggest that while there has been a general 
  decrease in spring SCE since 1915, it is likely that winter SCE has increased 
  (Brown and Goodison, 1996; Frei et al., 1999; Hughes and Robinson, 1996; Hughes 
  et al., 1996). Similar to the results in North America, in Eurasia April SCE 
  has significantly decreased; but lack of data has prevented an analysis of winter 
  trends (Brown, 2000). Over Canada, there has been a general decrease in snow 
  depth since 1946, especially during spring, in agreement with decreases in SCE 
  (Brown and Braaten, 1998). Winter depths have declined over European Russia 
  since 1900 (Meshcherskaya et al., 1995), but have increased elsewhere over Russia 
  in the past few decades (Fallot et al., 1997). The common thread between studies 
  that have examined seasonality is an overall reduction in spring snow cover 
  in the latter half of the 20th century.</p>
<p>There have been relatively few studies of snowfall trends across the globe. 
  Statistically significant increases in seasonal snowfall have been observed 
  over the central USA in the 20th century (Hughes and Robinson, 1996). In recent 
  decades, snowfall has also been heavier to the lee of the North American Great 
  Lakes than earlier in the century (Leathers and Ellis, 1996). These findings 
  are in line with observations from Canada and the former Soviet Union, reflecting 
  a trend towards increased precipitation over the mid-latitude lands in the Northern 
  Hemisphere (Groisman and Easterling, 1994; Brown and Goodison, 1996; Ye et al., 
  1998).</p>

      <p><b>Figure 2.13:</b> (a) Anomalies of monthly snow cover over the Northern 
        Hemisphere lands (including Greenland) between November 1966 and May 2000. 
        Also shown are twelve-month running anomalies of hemispheric snow extent, 
        plotted on the seventh month of a given interval. Anomalies are calculated 
        from NOAA/NESDIS snow maps. Mean hemispheric snow extent is 25.2 million 
        km<sup>2</sup> for the full period of record. the curve of running means 
        is extrapolated by using period of record monthly means for 12 months 
        in the late 1960s in order to create a continuous curve of running means. 
        Missing months fell between May and October, and no winter months are 
        missing. June 1999 to May 2000 values are based on preliminary analyses. 
        (b) Seasonal snowcover anomalies (in million km<sup>2</sup>) versus temperature 
        anomalies (in &deg;C). Both snow and temperature anomalies are area averages 
        over the region for which climatological values of seasonal snow-cover 
        frequency (based on the 1973 to 1998 period) are between 10 and 90%. Season 
        is indicated at the top of each panel. Axis for snow anomaly on the left-hand-side 
        y axis, axis for temperature anomaly is on the right-hand-side y axis. 
        Bar plot indicates time-series of snow cover anomalies. Continuous colour 
        curve indicates nine-point weighted average of snow-cover anomaly. Dashed 
        black curve indicates time-series of nine-point weighted average of area 
        average temperature anomaly. Snow-cover calculations are based on the 
        NOAA/NESDIS snow cover data for the period 1973 to 1998 (updated from 
        Robinson et al., 1993). Temperature calculations are based on the Jones 
        data set, hence anomalies are with respect to the time period 1961 to 
        1990. Snow anomalies are with respect to the time period 1973 to 1998. 
        Correlation coefficient (r) between seasonal snow cover anomalies and 
        temperature anomalies is indicated in parentheses. (Figure contributed 
        by David A. Robinson and Anjuli Bamzai, Rutgers University.) </p>
