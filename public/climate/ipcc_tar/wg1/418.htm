<h4>11.2.3.4 Sensitivity to climatic change</h4>
<p>The sensitivity of the ice sheet's surface mass balance has been studied 
  with multiple regression analyses, simple meteorological models, and GCMs (<a href="#tab117">Table 
  11.7</a>). Most progress since the SAR has been made with several coupled AOGCMs, 
  especially in the "time-slice" mode in which a high-resolution AGCM 
  (Atmospheric General Circulation Model) is driven by output from a low-resolution 
  transient AOGCM experiment for a limited duration of time. Model resolution 
  of typically 100 km allows for a more realistic topography crucial to better 
  resolving temperature gradients and orographic forcing of precipitation along 
  the steep margins of the polar ice sheets. Even then, GCMs do not yet perform 
  well in reproducing melting directly from the surface energy fluxes. The ablation 
  zone around the Greenland ice sheet is mostly narrower than 100 km, and the 
  important role played by topography therefore requires the use of downscaling 
  techniques to transfer information to local and even finer grids (Glover, 1999). 
  An additional complication is that not all melt water runs off to the ocean 
  and can be partly retained on or in the ice sheet (Pfeffer et al., 1991; Janssens 
  and Huybrechts, 2000). </p>

  uniform in the studies of Van de Wal (1996) and Janssens and Huybrechts (2000). 
  Another difference amongst the GCM results concerns the time window over which 
  the sensitivities are assessed. The CSIRO9/T63 sensivities are estimated from 
  high-resolution runs forced with observed SSTs for the recent past (Smith et 
  al., 1998; Smith, 1999), whereas the ECHAM data are given as specific mass balance 
  changes for doubled minus present atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Thompson and Pollard 
  (1997) report similar results to the ECHAM studies but the corresponding sensitivity 
  value could not be calculated because the associated temperature information 
  is not provided. Some palaeoclimatic data from central Greenland ice cores indicate 
  that variations in precipitation during the Holocene are related to changes 
  in atmospheric circulation rather than directly to local temperature (Kapsner 
  et al., 1995; Cuffey and Clow, 1997), such that precipitation might not increase 
  with temperature (in contrast with Clausen et al., 1988). For glacial-interglacial 
  transitions, the ice cores do exhibit a strong positive correlation between 
  temperature and precipitation (Dansgaard et al., 1993; Dahl-Jensen et al., 1993; 
  Kapsner et al., 1995; Cuffey and Marshall, 2000), as simulated by AOGCMs for 
  anthropogenic warming. Although other changes took place at the glacial-interglacial 
  transition, this large climate shift could be argued to be a better analogue 
  for anthropogenic climate change than the smaller fluctuations of the Holocene. 
  To allow for changes in circulation patterns and associated temperature and 
  precipitation patterns, we have used time-dependent AOGCM experiments to calculate 
  the Greenland contribution (<a href="429.htm#1151">Section 11.5.1</a>).</p>
<p>For Antarctica, mass-balance sensitivities for a 1&deg;C local warming are 
  close to -0.4 mm/yr (with one outlier of -0.8 mm/yr) of global sea 
  level equivalent. A common feature of all methods is the insignificant role 
  of melting, even for summer temperature increases of a few degrees, so that 
  only accumulation changes need to be considered. The sensitivity for the case 
  that the change in accumulation is set proportional to the relative change in 
  saturation vapour pressure is at the lower end of the sensitivity range, suggesting 
  that in a warmer climate changes in atmospheric circulation and increased moisture 
  advection can become equally important, in particular close to the ice sheet 
  margin (Bromwich, 1995; Steig, 1997). Both ECHAM3 and ECHAM4/OPYC3 give a similar 
  specific balance change over the ice sheet for doubled versus present atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> to that found by Thompson and Pollard (1997). </p>
<p>In summary, the static sensitivity values suggest a larger role for Antarctica 
  than for Greenland for an identical local temperature increase, meaning that 
  the polar ice sheets combined would produce a sea level lowering, but the spread 
  of the individual estimates includes the possibility that both ice sheets may 
  also balance one another for doubled atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (Ohmura 
  et al., 1996; Thompson and Pollard, 1997). For CO<sub>2</sub> increasing according 
  to the IS92a scenario (without aerosol), studies by Van de Wal and Oerlemans 
  (1997) and Huybrechts and De Wolde (1999) calculated sea level contributions 
  for 1990 to 2100 of +80 to +100 mm from the Greenland ice sheet and about -80 
  mm from the Antarctic ice sheet. On this hundred year time-scale, ice-dynamics 
  on the Greenland ice sheet was found to counteract the mass-balance-only effect 
  by between 10 and 20%. Changes in both the area-elevation distribution and iceberg 
  discharge played a role, although the physics controlling the latter are poorly 
  known and therefore not well represented in the models. Because of its longer 
  response time-scales, the Antarctic ice sheet hardly exhibits any dynamic response 
  on a century time-scale, except when melting rates below the ice shelves were 
  prescribed to rise by in excess of 1 m/yr (O'Farrell et al., 1997; Warner 
  and Budd, 1998; Huybrechts and De Wolde, 1999; see also <a href="435.htm">Section 
  11.5.4.3</a>). </p>
