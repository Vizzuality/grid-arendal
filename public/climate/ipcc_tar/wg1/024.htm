<h2>D.4 Overall Assessment of Abilities</h2>
  
<i>Coupled models have evolved and improved significantly since the SAR. In general, 
they provide credible simulations of climate, at least down to sub-continental 
scales and over temporal scales from seasonal to decadal. Coupled models, as a 
class, are considered to be suitable tools to provide useful projections of future 
climates.</i> These models cannot yet simulate all aspects of climate (e.g., they 
still cannot account fully for the observed trend in the surface-troposphere temperature 
differences since 1979). Clouds and humidity also remain sources of significant 
uncertainty, but there have been incremental improvements in simulations of these 
quantities. No single model can be considered "best", and it is important 
to utilise results from a range of carefully evaluated coupled models to explore 
effects of different formulations. The rationale for increased confidence in models 
arises from model performance in the following areas.<br>
<a name="flux"></a>
<h3>Flux adjustment</h3>
  
<i>The overall confidence in model projections is increased by the improved performance 
of several models that do not use flux adjustment. These models now maintain stable, 
multi-century simulations of surface climate that are considered to be of sufficient 
quality to allow their use for climate change projections.</i> The changes whereby 
many models can now run without flux adjustment have come from improvements in 
both the atmospheric and oceanic components. In the model atmosphere, improvements 
in convection, the boundary layer, clouds, and surface latent heat fluxes are 
most notable. In the model ocean, the improvements are in resolution, boundary 
layer mixing, and in the representation of eddies. The results from climate change 
studies with flux adjusted and non-flux adjusted models are broadly in agreement; 
nonetheless, the development of stable non-flux adjusted models increases confidence 
in their ability to simulate future climates.<br>

<i>Confidence in the ability of models to project future climates is increased 
by the ability of several models to reproduce warming trends in the 20th century 
surface air temperature when driven by increased greenhouse gases and sulphate 
aerosols.</i> This is illustrated in <a href="#figTechSum13">Figure 13</a>. However, 
only idealized scenarios of sulphate aerosols have been used and contributions 
from some additional processes and forcings may not have been included in the 
models. Some modelling studies suggest that inclusion of additional forcings like 
solar variability and volcanic aerosols may improve some aspects of the simulated 
climate variability of the 20th century.<br>
<a name="extreme"></a>
<h3>Extreme events</h3>
  
<i>Analysis of and confidence in extreme events simulated within climate models 
are still emerging, particularly for storm tracks and storm frequency.</i> "Tropical-cyclone-like" 
vortices are being simulated in climate models, although enough uncertainty remains 
over their interpretation to warrant caution in projections of tropical cyclone 
changes. However, in general, the analysis of extreme events in both observations 
(see <a href="014.htm#b6">Section B.6</a>) and coupled models is underdeveloped.<br>
<a name="interannual"></a>
<h3>Interannual variability</h3>
  
<i>The performance of coupled models in simulating ENSO has improved; however, 
its variability is displaced westward and its strength is generally underestimated. 
</i> When suitably initialised with surface wind and sub-surface ocean data, some 
coupled models have had a degree of success in predicting ENSO events.<br>
<a name="intercomparisons"></a>
<h3>Model intercomparisons</h3>
<i>The growth in systematic intercomparisons of models provides the core evidence 
for the growing capabilities of climate models. </i>For example, the Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) is enabling a more comprehensive and systematic 
evaluation and intercomparison of coupled models run in a standardised configuration 
and responding to standardised forcing. Some degree of quantification of improvements 
in coupled model performance has now been demonstrated. The Palaeoclimate Model 
Intercomparison Project (PMIP) provides intercomparisons of models for the mid-Holocene 
(6,000 years before present) and for the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years before 
present). The ability of these models to simulate some aspects of palaeoclimates, 
compared to a range of palaeoclimate proxy data, gives confidence in models (at 
least the atmospheric component) over a range of difference forcings.<br clear="all">
