<h3><a name="265"></a>2.6.5 The Northern Hemisphere excluding the North Pacific 
  <br>
  Ocean </h3>
<p>The atmospheric circulation over the Northern Hemisphere has exhibited anomalous 
  behaviour over the past several decades. In particular, the dominant patterns 
  of atmospheric variability in the winter half-year have tended to be strongly 
  biased to one phase. Thus SLP has been lower than average over the mid- and 
  high latitudes of the North Atlantic Ocean, as well as over much of the Arctic, 
  while it has been higher than average over the sub-tropical oceans, especially 
  the Atlantic. Moreover, in the past thirty years, changes in these leading patterns 
  of natural atmospheric variability appear to be unusual in the context of the 
  observational record. </p>

<p>The dominant pattern of atmospheric circulation variability over the North 
  Atlantic is known as the NAO, and its wintertime index is shown in <a href="#fig230">Figure 
  2.30</a> (updated from Hurrell, 1995). As discussed in the SAR, positive values 
  of the NAO give stronger than average westerlies over the mid-latitudes of the 
  Atlantic with low SLP anomalies in the Icelandic region and over much of the 
  Arctic and high SLP anomalies across the sub-tropical Atlantic and into southern 
  Europe. The positive, enhanced westerly, phase of the NAO is associated with 
  cold winters over the north-west Atlantic and warm winters over Europe, Siberia 
  and eastern Asia (Thompson and Wallace, 2001) as well as wet conditions from 
  Iceland to Scandinavia and dry winters over southern Europe. A sharp reversal 
  is evident in the NAO index starting around 1970 from a negative towards a positive 
  phase. Since about 1985, the NAO has tended to remain in a strong positive phase, 
  though with substantial interannual variability. Hurrell (1996) and Thompson 
  et al. (2000a) showed that the recent upward trend in the NAO accounts for much 
  of the regional surface winter half-year warming over northern Europe and Asia 
  north of about 40&deg;N over the past thirty years, as well as the cooling over 
  the north-west Atlantic (see <a href="056.htm#2223">Section 2.2.2.3</a>). Moreover, 
  when circulation changes over the North Pacific are also considered, much of 
  the pattern of the Northern Hemisphere winter half-year surface temperature 
  changes since the mid-1970s can be explained. This can be associated with changes 
  in the NAO, and in the PNA atmospheric pattern related to ENSO or the PDO (Graf 
  et al., 1995; Wallace et al., 1995; Shabbar et al., 1997; Thompson and Wallace, 
  1998, 2000).</p>
<p>The changes in atmospheric circulation over the Atlantic are also connected 
  with much of the observed pressure fall over the Arctic in recent years (Walsh 
  et al., 1996). Other features related to the circulation changes include the 
  strengthening of sub-polar westerlies from the surface of the North Atlantic 
  up, in winter as high as the lower stratosphere (Thompson et al., 2000a) and 
  pronounced regional changes in precipitation patterns (Hurrell, 1995; Dai et 
  al., 1997b; Hurrell and van Loon 1997; <a href="077.htm#2521">Section 2.5.2.1</a>). 
  Associated precipitation increases have resulted in the notable advance of some 
  Scandinavian glaciers (Hagen et al., 1995), while decreases to the south of 
  about 50oN have contributed to the further retreat of Alpine glaciers (Frank, 
  1997; see also <a href="063.htm#2253">Section 2.2.5.3</a>)</p>
<p>The NAO is regarded (largely) by some as the regional expression of a zonally 
  symmetrical hemispheric mode of variability characterised by a seesaw of atmospheric 
  mass between the polar cap and the mid-latitudes in both the Atlantic and Pacific 
  Ocean basins (Thompson and Wallace, 1998, 2001). This mode has been named the 
  AO (<a href="#fig230">Figure 2.30</a>). The time-series of the NAO and 
  AO are quite similar: the correlation of monthly anomalies of station data SLP 
  series of NAO and AO is about 0.7 (depending on their exact definitions and 
  epochs) while seasonal variations shown in <a href="#fig230">Figure 2.30</a> 
  have even higher correlations. The NAO and AO can be viewed as manifestations 
  of the same basic phenomenon (Wallace, 2000). </p>
<p>Changes and decadal fluctuations in sea-ice cover in the Labrador and Greenland 
  Seas, as well as over the Arctic, appear well correlated with the NAO (Chapman 
  and Walsh, 1993; Maslanik et al., 1996; McPhee et al., 1998; Mysak and Venegas, 
  1998; Parkinson et al., 1999; Deser et al., 2000). The relationship between 
  the SLP and ice anomaly fields is consistent with the idea that atmospheric 
  circulation anomalies force the sea-ice variations (Prisenberg et al., 1997). 
  Feedbacks or other influences of winter ice anomalies on the atmosphere have 
  been more difficult to detect, although Deser et al. (2000) suggest that a local 
  response of the atmospheric circulation to the reduced sea-ice cover east of 
  Greenland in recent years is also apparent (see also <a href="062.htm#2252">Section 
  2.2.5.2</a>).</p>
<p>A number of studies have placed the recent positive values of the NAO into 
  a longer-term perspective (Jones et al., 1997a; Appenzeller et al., 1998; Cook 
  et al., 1998; Luterbacher et al., 1999; Osborn et al., 1999) back to the 1700s. 
  The recent strength of the positive phase of the NAO seems unusual from these 
  reconstructions but, as in <a href="083.htm#fig228">Figure 2.28</a>, these proxy 
  data reconstructions may underestimate variability. An extended positive phase 
  occurred in the early 20th century (<a href="#fig230">Figure 2.30</a>), 
  particularly pronounced in January (Parker and Folland, 1988), comparable in 
  length to the recent positive phase. Higher-frequency variability of the NAO 
  also appears to have varied. Hurrell and van Loon (1997) showed that quasi-decadal 
  (6 to 10 year) variability has become more pronounced over the latter half of 
  the 20th century, while quasi-biennial variability dominated in the early instrumental 
  record.</p>
