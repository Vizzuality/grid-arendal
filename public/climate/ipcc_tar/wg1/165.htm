      <p><b>Figure 5.1: </b>Extinction efficiency (per unit total aerosol mass) 
        and single scattering albedo of aerosols. The calculations are integrated 
        over a typical solar pectrum rather than using a single wavelength. Aerosols 
        with diameters between about 0.1 and 2 &micro;m scatter the most light 
        per unit mass. Coarse mode aerosols (i.e., those larger than accumulation 
        mode) have a smaller single scattering albedo even if they are made of 
        the same material (i.e., refractive index) as accumula-tion mode aerosols. 
        If the refractive index 1.37 0.001<i>i</i> is viewed as that of a hydrated

<h3><a name="fig51"></a>5.1.2 Aerosol Properties Relevant to Radiative Forcing</h3>
<p>The radiatively important properties of atmospheric aerosols (both direct and 
  indirect) are determined at the most fundamental level by the aerosol composition 
  and size distribution. However, for purposes of the direct radiative forcing 
  calculation and for assessment of uncertainties, these properties can be subsumed 
  into a small set of parameters. Knowledge of a set of four quantities as a function 
  of wavelength is necessary to translate aerosol burdens into first aerosol optical 
  depths, and then a radiative perturbation: the mass light-scattering efficiency 
  a<sub>sp</sub>, the functional dependence of light-scattering on relative humidity 
  f(RH), the single-scattering albedo w<sub>o</sub>, and the asymmetry parameter 
  g (cf., Charlson et al., 1992; Penner et al., 1994a).</p>
<p>Light scattering by aerosols is measurable as well as calculable from measured 
  aerosol size and composition. This permits comparisons, called closure studies, 
  of the different measurements for consistency. An example is the comparison 
  of the derived optical depth with directly measured or inferred optical depths 
  from sunphotometers or satellite radiometers. Indeed, various sorts of closure 
  studies have been successfully conducted and lend added credibility to the measurements 
  of the individual quantities (e.g., McMurry et al., 1996; Clarke et al., 1996; 
  Hegg et al., 1997; Quinn and Coffman, 1998; Wenny et al., 1998; Raes et al., 
  2000). Closure studies can also provide objective estimates of the uncertainty 
  in calculating radiative quantities such as optical depth.<br>
</p>
<p>Aerosols in the accumulation mode, i.e., those with dry diameters between 0.1 
  and 1 mm (Schwartz, 1996) are of most importance. These aerosols can hydrate 
  to diameters between 0.1 and 2 mm where their mass extinction efficiency is 
  largest (see <a href="#fig51">Figure 5.1</a>). Accumulation mode aerosols not 
  only have high scattering efficiency, they also have the longest atmospheric 
  lifetime: smaller particles coagulate more quickly while nucleation to cloud 
  drops or impaction onto the surface removes larger particles efficiently. Accumulation 
  mode aerosols form the majority of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Hence, anthropogenic 
  aerosol perturbations such as sulphur emissions have the greatest climate impact 
  when, as is often the case, they produce or affect accumulation mode aerosols 
  (Jones et al., 1994).<br>
</p>
<p>The direct radiative effect of aerosols is also very sensitive to the single 
  scattering albedo <FONT FACE="Symbol">w</font><sub>o</sub>. For example, a change 
  in <FONT FACE="Symbol">w</font><sub>o</sub> from 0.9 to 0.8 can often change 
  the sign of the direct effect, depending on the albedo of the underlying surface 
  and the altitude of the aerosols (Hansen et al., 1997). Unfortunately, it is 
  difficult to measure <FONT FACE="Symbol">w</font><sub>o</sub> accurately. The 
  mass of black carbon on a filter can be converted to light absorption, but the 
  conversion depends on the size and mixing state of the black carbon with the 
  rest of the aerosols. The mass measurements are themselves difficult, as discussed 
  in <a href="170.htm">Section 5.2.2.4</a>. Aerosol light absorption can also 
  be measured as the difference in light extinction and scattering. Very careful 
  calibrations are required because the absorption is often a difference between 
  two large numbers. As discussed in <a href="178.htm">Section 5.2.4</a>, it is 
  difficult to retrieve <FONT FACE="Symbol">w</font><sub>o</sub> from satellite 
  data. Well-calibrated sunphotometers can derive <FONT FACE="Symbol">w</font><sub>o</sub> 
  by comparing light scattering measured away from the Sun with direct Sun extinction 
  measurements (Dubovik et al., 1998).</p>
<p>Some encouraging comparisons have been made between different techniques for 
  measurements of <FONT FACE="Symbol">w</font><sub>o</sub> and related quantities. 
  Direct measurements of light absorption near Denver, Colorado using photo-acoustic 
  spectroscopy were highly correlated with a filter technique (Moosm&uuml;ller 
  et al., 1998). However, these results also pointed to a possible strong wavelength 
  dependence in the light absorption. An airborne comparison of six techniques 
  (extinction cell, three filter techniques, irradiance measurements, and black 
  carbon mass by thermal evolution) in biomass burning plumes and hazes was reported 
  by Reid et al. (1998a). Regional averages of wo derived from all techniques 
  except thermal evolution agreed within about 0.02 (<FONT FACE="Symbol">w</font><sub>o</sub> 
  is dimensionless), but individual data points were only moderately correlated 
  (regression coefficient values of about 0.6).</p>
