<h2>13.3 Defining the Baseline </h2>
<p>A baseline period is needed to define the observed climate with which climate 
  change information is usually combined to create a climate scenario. When using 
  climate model results for scenario construction, the baseline also serves as 
  the reference period from which the modelled future change in climate is calculated. 
</p>
<h3><a name="1331"></a>13.3.1 The Choice of Baseline Period</h3>
<p>The choice of baseline period has often been governed by availability of the 
  required climate data. Examples of adopted baseline periods include 1931 to 
  1960 (Leemans and Solomon, 1993), 1951 to 1980 (Smith and Pitts, 1997), or 1961 
  to 1990 (Kittel et al., 1995; Hulme et al., 1999b).</p>
<p>There may be climatological reasons to favour earlier baseline periods over 
  later ones (IPCC, 1994). For example, later periods such as 1961 to 1990 are 
  likely to have larger anthropogenic trends embedded in the climate data, especially 
  the effects of sulphate aerosols over regions such as Europe and eastern USA 
  (Karl et al., 1996). In this regard, the "ideal" baseline period would 
  be in the 19th century when anthropogenic effects on global climate were negligible. 
  Most impact assessments, however, seek to determine the effect of climate change 
  with respect to "the present", and therefore recent baseline periods 
  such as 1961 to 1990 are usually favoured. A further attraction of using 1961 
  to 1990 is that observational climate data coverage and availability are generally 
  better for this period compared to earlier ones.</p>
<p>Whatever baseline period is adopted, it is important to acknowledge that there 
  are differences between climatological averages based on century-long data (e.g., 
  Legates and Wilmott, 1990) and those based on sub-periods. Moreover, different 
  30-year periods have been shown to exhibit differences in regional annual mean 
  baseline temperature and precipitation of up to &plusmn;0.5&ordm;C and &plusmn;15% 
  respectively (Hulme and New, 1997; Visser et al., 2000; see also <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>).</p>
<h3><a name="1332"></a>13.3.2 The Adequacy of Baseline Climatological Data</h3>
<p>The adequacy of observed baseline climate data sets can only be evaluated in 
  the context of particular climate scenario construction methods, since different 
  methods have differing demands for baseline climate data. </p>
<p>There are an increasing number of gridded global (e.g., Leemans and Cramer, 
  1991; New et al., 1999) and national (e.g., Kittel et al., 1995, 1997; Frei 
  and Sch&auml;r, 1998) climate data sets describing mean surface climate, although 
  few describe inter-annual climate variability (see Kittel et al., 1997; Xie 
  and Arkin, 1997; New et al., 2000). Differences between alternative gridded 
  regional or global baseline climate data sets may be large, and these may induce 
  non-trivial differences in climate change impacts that use climate scenarios 
  incorporating different baseline climate data (e.g., Arnell, 1999). These differences 
  may be as much a function of different interpolation methods and station densities 
  as they are of errors in observations or the result of sampling different time 
  periods (Hulme and New, 1997; New, 1999). A common problem that some methods 
  endeavour to correct is systematic biases in station locations (e.g., towards 
  low elevation sites). The adequacy of different techniques (e.g., Daly et al., 
  1994; Hutchinson, 1995; New et al., 1999) to interpolate station records under 
  conditions of varying station density and/or different topography has not been 
  systematically evaluated. </p>
<p>A growing number of climate scenarios require gridded daily baseline climatological 
  data sets at continental or global scales yet, to date, the only observed data 
  products that meet this criterion are experimental (e.g., Piper and Stewart, 
  1996; Widmann and Bretherton, 2000). For this and other reasons, attempts have 
  been made to combine monthly observed climatologies with stochastic weather 
  generators to allow "synthetic" daily observed baseline data to be 
  generated for national (e.g., Carter et al., 1996a; Semenov and Brooks, 1999), 
  continental (e.g., Voet et al., 1996; Kittel et al., 1997), or even global (e.g., 
  Friend, 1998) scales. Weather generators are statistical models of observed 
  sequences of weather variables, whose outputs resemble weather data at individual 
  or multi-site locations (Wilks and Wilby, 1999). Access to long observed daily 
  weather series for many parts of the world (e.g., oceans, polar regions and 
  some developing countries) is a problem for climate scenario developers who 
  wish to calibrate and use weather generators.</p>
<p>A number of statistical downscaling techniques (see <a href="485.htm">Section 
  13.4</a> and<a href="373.htm"> Chapter 10</a>, <a href="395.htm">Section 10.6</a>, 
  for definition) used in scenario development employ Numerical Weather Prediction 
  (NWP) reanalysis data products as a source of upper air climate data (Kalnay 
  et al., 1996). These reanalysis data sets extend over periods up to 40 years 
  and provide spatial and temporal resolution sometimes lacking in observed climate 
  data sets. Relatively little detailed work has compared such reanalysis data 
  with independent observed data sets (see Santer et al., 1999, and Widmann and 
  Bretherton, 2000, for two exceptions), but it is known that certain reanalysis 
  variables - such as precipitation and some other hydrological variables - are 
  unreliable.</p>
