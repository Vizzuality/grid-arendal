<h3>7.1.3 Predictability of the Climate System</h3>
<p>The Earth's atmosphere-ocean dynamics is chaotic: its evolution is sensitive 
  to small perturbations in initial conditions. This sensitivity limits our ability 
  to predict the detailed evolution of weather; inevitable errors and uncertainties 
  in the starting conditions of a weather forecast amplify through the forecast 
  (Palmer, 2000). As well as uncertainty in initial conditions, such predictions 
  are also degraded by errors and uncertainties in our ability to represent accurately 
  the significant climate processes. In practice, detailed weather prediction 
  is limited to about two weeks.</p>
<p>However, because of the more slowly varying components of the climate system, 
  predictability of climate is not limited to the two week time-scale. Perhaps 
  the most well-known and clear cut example of longer-term predictability is El 
  Ni&ntilde;o (see <a href="303.htm">Section 7.6.5</a>) which is predictable at 
  least six months in advance. There is some evidence that aspects of the physical 
  climate system are predictable on even longer time-scales (see <a href="298.htm">Section 
  7.6</a>). In practice, if natural decadal variability is partially sensitive 
  to initial conditions, then projections of climate change for the 21st century 
  will exhibit a similar sensitivity.</p>
<p>In order to be able to make reliable forecasts in the presence of both initial 
  condition and model uncertainty, it is now becoming common to repeat the prediction 
  many times from different perturbed initial states, and using different global 
  models (from the stock of global models that exist in the world weather and 
  climate modelling community). These so-called multi-model, multi-initial-condition 
  ensembles are the optimal basis of probability forecasts (e.g., of a weather 
  event, El Ni&ntilde;o, or the state of the THC).</p>
<p>Estimating anthropogenic climate change on times much longer than the predictability 
  time-scale of natural climate fluctuations does not, by definition, depend on 
  the initial state. On these time-scales, the problem of predicting climate change 
  is one of estimating changes in the probability distribution of climatic states 
  (e.g., cyclonic/anticyclonic weather, El Ni&ntilde;o, the THC, global mean temperature) 
  as atmospheric composition is altered in some prescribed manner. Like the initial 
  value problems mentioned above, estimates of such changes to the probability 
  distribution of climate states must be evaluated using ensemble prediction techniques.</p>
<p>The number of ensemble members required to estimate reliably changes to the 
  probability distribution of a given climatic phenomenon depends on the phenomenon 
  in question. Estimating changes in the probability distribution of localised 
  extreme weather events, which by their nature occur infrequently, may require 
  very large ensembles with hundreds of members. Estimating changes in the probability 
  distribution of large scale frequent events (e.g., the probability of above-average 
  hemispheric mean temperature) requires much smaller ensembles.</p>
<p>An important question is whether a multi-model ensemble made by pooling the 
  world climate community's stock of global models adequately spans the uncertainty 
  in our ability to represent faithfully the evolution of climate. Since the members 
  of this stock of models were not developed independently of one another, such 
  an ensemble does not constitute an independent unbiased sampling of possible 
  model formulations.</p>
