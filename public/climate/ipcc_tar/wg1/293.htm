<h2>7.5 Cryosphere Processes and Feedbacks</h2>
<p>The cryosphere, comprising snow and ice within the Earth system, introduces 
  forcings that can affect oceanic deep water formation and feedbacks that can 
  amplify climate variability and change. Important feedbacks involve: (i) the 
  dependence of surface albedo on the temperature, depth and age of ice and snow; 
  (ii) the influence of melt/freeze processes on sea surface salinity and deep-water 
  formation. Palaeoclimatic evidence (<a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="072.htm">Section 
  2.4</a>), indicating that extreme climate excursions have been induced by cryospheric 
  processes, as well as recent observations that Arctic sea ice has decreased 
  significantly in both extent and thickness (see <a href="#box71">Box 7.1</a>), 
  motivates the addition of this new section to the TAR.<br>

      <p><b>Box 7.1:</b> Sea ice and climate change.</p>
      <p><i>Sea-ice processes:</i><br>
        Sea ice in the Arctic and around Antarctica responds directly to climate 
        change and may, if properly monitored, become increas-ingly important 
        for detecting climate change. Although sea ice covers only about 5% of 
        the Earth's surface, its extent and thickness have important influences 
        in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. Increasing the understanding of 
        these processes and representing them more realistically in climate models 
        is important for making more reliable climate change projections.<br>
        Several processes associated with sea ice are climatically relevant. The 
        sea-ice albedo effect is an important contributor to the amplification 
        of projected warming at high latitudes. Albedo decreases if the extent 
        of sea ice is reduced and more ocean surface is exposed, resulting in 
        increased heat absorption and hence warming. Melting of snow and the formation 
        of melt-water ponds also reduces albedo and alters the radiation balance. 
        Changes in sea-ice thickness and lead (open water) fraction modify the 
        heat transfer from the ocean: thinner sea ice and more leads result in 
        enhanced heat loss from the exposed ocean thus further warming the atmosphere. 
        Changes in cloud cover may influence how large this effect really is. 
        A principal mechanism for dense water formation in the ocean around Antarctica 
        and in shelf regions of the Arctic is the rejection of brine as sea water 
        freezes.<br>
        Changes in sea-ice formation alter the properties and formation rates 
        of ocean deep water and therefore have an influence on the water mass 
        structure that reaches far beyond the area of sea ice. Finally, ice export 
        from the Arctic represents an important southward flux of fresh water 
        which influences the density structure of the upper ocean in the Nordic, 
        Labrador and Irminger Seas.</p>

              for 1901 to 1998 are denoted by open circles (Chapman and Walsh, 
              1993, revised and updated) and for 1978 to 1998 by open triangles 
              (Parkinson et al., 1999, updated). The modelled sea-ice extents 
              are from the GFDL and Hadley Centre climate model runs forced by 
              observed CO<sub>2</sub> and aerosols. Modelled data are smoothed 
              by a polynomial fit. Sea-ice extent in these models was determined 
              as the area which had a thickness exceeding 2 cm. This criterion 
              was determined to yield the best agreement with the observed mean 
              during 1953 to 1998; this choice also reproduces the seasonal cycle

      <p><i><a name="box71fig1"></a></i><i>Observations of sea ice:</i><br>
        Observations of sea-ice extent and concentration (the fraction of local 
        area covered by ice) are based primarily on satellite data available since 
        the late 1970s. Sea-ice thickness is also important in assessing possible 
        changes in the amount of sea ice; however, thickness observations are 
        more difficult to make. For the Arctic, thickness data come primarily 
        from sonar measure-ments from submarines and a few oceanographic moorings. 
        Although limited, the observations indicate statistically significant 
        decreases in ice extent and thickness over the past few decades, with 
        Arctic sea-ice extent declining at a rate of about 3% per decade since 
        the late 1970s. Sea-ice retreat in the Arctic spring and summer over the 
        last few decades is consistent with an increase in spring temperature, 
        and to a lesser extent, summer temperatures at high latitudes. Thickness 
        data show a near 40% decrease in the summer minimum thickness of Arctic 
        sea ice over approximately the last 30 years. Estimates using independent 
        methods for the winter, but over a much shorter period, also suggest thickness 
        reductions, but at a markedly slower rate.<br>
        However, due to limited sampling, uncertainties are difficult to estimate, 
        and the influence of decadal to multi-decadal variability cannot yet be 
        assessed. </p>
      <p>While Arctic sea-ice extent and thickness have clearly decreased in the 
        last 20 years, changes in Antarctic sea-ice extent have been insignificant. 
        The earlier part of the data set indicates somewhat greater ice extents 
        in the early 1970s, and indirect evidence from historical records also 
        points to more northerly sea-ice margins in the 1930s and 1940s. Warming 
        over much of<br>
        Antarctica has only been about 0.5&deg;C over the last 50 years with the 
        notable exception of the Antarctic Peninsula where temper-atures have 
        increased by about 2&deg;C for reasons that remain unclear.</p>
      <p><i>Sea-ice modelling and projection:</i><br>
        Sea ice is particularly difficult to simulate in climate models because 
        it is influenced directly by both the atmosphere (temper-ature, radiation, 
        wind) and the ocean (heat transport and mixing, and surface currents), 
        and because many of the relevant processes require high grid resolution 
        or must be parametrized. Recent coupled climate models include a sea-ice 
        component that incorporates openings in the ice, often in conjunction 
        with ice dynamics (motion and deformation). Furthermore, updated parametrizations 
        of snow ageing and associated albedo changes and multi-layer formulations 
        of heat conduction through the ice and overlying snow cover are being 
        implemented in some models. Although many thermodynamic processes are 
        crudely approximated, it is unclear how these approximations contribute 
        to errors in climate model simulations. Sea-ice dynamics is important 
        in determining local ice thickness and export of sea ice from the formation 
        areas, but despite the rather mature status of physically based sea-ice 
        dynamics models, only a few of the current coupled climate models include 
        such a component. Coupled model simulations of the seasonal cycle of sea-ice 
        coverage in both hemispheres exhibit large deviations from the limited 
        observational data base, as illustrated in Chapter 8, and current research 
        is aimed at improving model performance.</p>
      <p>Coupled model projections of the future distribution of sea ice differ 
        quantitatively from one to another as shown in <a href="338.htm">Chapter
        9</a>. However, they agree that sea-ice extent and thickness will decline 
        over the 21st century as the climate warms. <a href="#box71fig1">Box 7.1, 
        Figure 1</a> illustrates this with annual mean Arctic ice extent results 
        from two coupled models. The simulations of ice extent decline over the 
        past 30 years are in good agreement with the observations, lending confidence 
        to the subsequent projections which show a substantial decrease of Arctic 
        sea-ice cover leading to roughly 20% reduction in annual mean Arctic sea-ice 
        extent by the year 2050.</p>
