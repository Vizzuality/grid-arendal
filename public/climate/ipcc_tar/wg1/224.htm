<h3>6.4.2 Forcing Estimates</h3>
<p>Earlier IPCC reports had quoted a value of about -0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup>/ decade 
  with a factor of two uncertainty. There have been revisions in this estimate 
  based on new data available on the O<sub>3</sub> trends (Harris et al., 1998; 
  WMO, 1999), and an extension of the period over which the forcing is computed. 
  Models using observed O<sub>3</sub> changes but with varied methods to derive 
  the temperature changes in the stratosphere have obtained -0.05 to -0.19 Wm<sup>-2</sup>/decade 
  (WMO, 1999).</p>
<p>Hansen et al. (1997a) have extended the calculations to include the O<sub>3</sub> 
  loss up to the mid-1990s and performed a variety of O<sub>3</sub> loss experiments 
  to investigate the forcing and response. In particular, they obtained forcings 
  of -0.2 and -0.28 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for the period 1979 to 1994 using SAGE/TOMS 
  and SAGE/SBUV satellite data, respectively. Hansen et al. (1998) updated their 
  forcing to -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with an uncertainty of 0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for 
  the period 1970 to present. Forster and Shine (1997) obtained forcings of -0.17 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup> and -0.22 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for the period 1979 to 1996 using 
  SAGE and SBUV observations, respectively. The WMO (1999) assessment gave a value 
  of -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with an uncertainty of &plusmn; 0.15 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  for the period from late 1970s to mid-1990s. Forster and Shine (1997) have also 
  extended the computations back to 1964 using O<sub>3</sub> changes deduced from 
  surface-based observations; combining these with an assumption that the decadal 
  rate of change of forcing from 1979 to 1991 was sustained to the mid-1990s yielded 
  a total stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> forcing of about -0.23 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. 
  Shine and Forster (1999) have revised this value to -0.15 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for 
  the period 1979 to 1997, choosing not to include the values prior to 1979 in 
  view of the lack of knowledge on the vertical profile which makes the sign of 
  the change also uncertain. They also revised the uncertainty to &plusmn; 0.12 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup> around the central estimate. A more recent estimate by Forster 
  (1999) yields -0.10 &plusmn; 0.02 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for the 1979 to 1997 period 
  using the SPARC O<sub>3</sub> profile (Harris et al., 1998). </p>
<p>There have been attempts to use satellite-observed O<sub>3</sub> and temperature 
  changes to gauge the forcing. Thus, Zhong et al. (1996, 1998) obtained a small 
  value of -0.02 Wm<sup>-2</sup>/decade; and with inclusion of the 14 micron band, 
  a value of -0.05 Wm<sup>-2</sup>/ decade. It has been noted that the poor vertical 
  resolution of the satellite temperature retrievals makes it difficult to estimate 
  the forcing; in fact, a similar calculation using radiosonde-based temperatures 
  yields a value of -0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup>/decade (Shine et al., 1998). The main 
  difficulty is that the temperature change in the vicinity of the lower stratosphere 
  critically affects the emission from the stratosphere into the troposphere. 
  Thus any uncertainty in the MSU satellite retrieval induced by the broad altitude 
  weighting function (see WMO, 1999) becomes an important factor in the estimation 
  of the forcing. Further, the degree of response of the climate system, embedded 
  in the observed temperature change (i.e., feedbacks), is not resolved in an 
  easy manner. This makes it difficult to distinguish quantitatively the part 
  of temperature change that is a consequence of the strato-spheric adjustment 
  process (which would be, by definition, a legitimate component of the forcing 
  estimate) and that which is due to mechanisms other than O<sub>3</sub> loss. 
  Thus, using observed temperatures to estimate the forcing may be more uncertain 
  than the model-based estimates. It must be noted though that both methods share 
  the difficulty of quantifying the vertical and geographical distributions of 
  the O<sub>3</sub> changes near the tropopause, and the rigorous association 
  of this to the observed temperature changes. In an overall sense, it is a difficult 
  task to verify the radiative forcing in cases where the stratospheric adjustment 
  yields a dramatically different result than the instantaneous forcing i.e., 
  where the species changes affect stratospheric temperatures and alter substantially 
  the long-wave radiative effects at the tropopause. A related point is the possible 
  upward movement of the tropopause which could explain in part the observed negative 
  trends in O<sub>3</sub> and temperature (Fortuin and Kelder, 1996).</p>
<p>Kiehl et al. (1999) obtained a radiative forcing of -0.187 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  using the O<sub>3</sub> profile data set describing changes since the late 1970s 
  due to stratospheric depletion alone, consistent with the range of other models 
  (see Shine et al., 1995). Kiehl et al. (1999) also present results using a very 
  different set of O<sub>3</sub> change profiles deduced from satellite-derived 
  total column O<sub>3</sub> and satellite-inferred tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  measurements to arrive at an implied O<sub>3</sub> forcing, considering changes 
  at and above the tropopause, of -0.01 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. The reason for the 
  considerably weaker estimate reflects the increased O<sub>3</sub> in the tropopause 
  region that is believed to have occurred since pre-industrial times (largely 
  before 1970) in many polluted areas. How the changes in O<sub>3</sub> at the 
  tropopause are prescribed is hence an important factor for the difference between 
  this calculation and those from the other estimates.</p>
<p>Clearly, since WMO (1992), this forcing has been investigated in an intensive 
  manner using different approaches, and the observational evidence of the O<sub>3</sub> 
  losses, including the spatial and seasonal characteristics, are now on a firmer 
  footing. In arriving at a best estimate for the forcing, we rely essentially 
  on the studies that have made use of stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> observations 
  directly. Based on this consideration, we adopt here a forcing of -0.15 &plusmn; 
  0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for the 1979 to 1997 period. However, it is cautioned that 
  the small values obtained by the two specific studies mentioned above inhibit 
  the placement of a high confidence in the estimate quoted.</p>
<p>In general, the reliability of the estimates above is affected by the fact 
  that the O<sub>3</sub> changes in the lower stratosphere, tropopause, and upper 
  troposphere are all poorly quantified, around the globe in general, such that 
  the entire global domain from 200 to 50 hPa becomes crucial for the temperature 
  change and the adjusted forcing. Forster and Shine (1997) note that the sensitivity 
  of forcing to percentage of O<sub>3</sub> loss near the tropopause is more than 
  when the changes occur lower in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Myhre et al. (1998a) derived O<sub>3</sub> changes using a chemical model in 
  contrast to observations. As the loss of O<sub>3</sub> in the upper stratosphere 
  in the simulations was large, a positive forcing of 0.02 Wm<sup>-2</sup>/decade 
  was obtained (see Ramanathan and Dickinson (1979) for an explanation of the 
  change of sign for a O<sub>3</sub> loss in the lower stratosphere versus the 
  upper stratosphere). While there are difficulties in modelling the O<sub>3</sub> 
  depletion in the global stratosphere (WMO, 1999), this study reiterates the 
  need to be cognisant of the role played by the vertical profile of O<sub>3</sub> 
  loss amounts in the entire stratosphere, i.e., middle and upper stratosphere 
  as well, besides the lower stratosphere.<br>
  An important issue is whether the actual surface temperature responses to the 
  forcing by stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> has the same relationship with forcing 
  as obtained for, say, CO<sub>2</sub> or solar constant changes. Hansen et al. 
  (1997a) and Christiansen (1999) have performed a host of GCM experiments to 
  test this concept. The forcing by lower stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> is an unusual 
  one in that it has a positive short-wave and a negative long-wave radiative 
  forcing. Moreover, it has a unique vertical structure owing to the fact that 
  the short-wave effects are felt at the surface while the long-wave is felt only 
  initially at the upper troposphere (Ramanathan and Dickinson, 1979; WMO, 1992). 
  Compared to, say, CO<sub>2</sub> change, the stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> forcing 
  is not global in extent, being very small in the tropics and increasing from 
  mid- to high latitudes; the O<sub>3</sub> forcing also differs in its vertical 
  structure, since the radiative forcings for CO<sub>2</sub> change in both the 
  troposphere and surface are of the same sign (WMO, 1986). The relationship between 
  the global mean forcing and response differs by less than 20% for O<sub>3</sub> 
  profiles, resembling somewhat the actual losses (Hansen et al., 1997a). However, 
  serious departures occur if the O<sub>3</sub> changes are introduced near surface 
  layers when the lapse rate change, together with cloud feedbacks, make the climate 
  sensitivity quite different from the nominal values. There also occur substantial 
  differences in the climate sensitivity parameter for O<sub>3</sub> losses in 
  the upper stratosphere. This is further substantiated by Christiansen (1999) 
  who shows that the higher climate sensitivity for upper stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  losses relative to lower stratospheric depletion is related to the vertical 
  partitioning of the forcing, in particular the relative roles of short-wave 
  and long-wave radiation in the surface-troposphere system. It is encouraging 
  that the global mean climate sensitivity parameter for cases involving lower 
  stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> changes and that for CO<sub>2</sub> changes (viz., 
  doubling) are reasonably similar in Christiansen (1999) while being within about 
  25% of a central value in Hansen et al. (1997a). An energy balance model study 
  (Bintanja et al., 1997) suggests a stronger albedo feedback for O<sub>3</sub> 
  changes than for CO<sub>2</sub> perturbations (see also WMO, 1999).</p>
<p>The evolution of the forcing due to stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> loss hinges 
  on the rate of recovery of the ozone layer, with special regards to the spatial 
  structure of such a recovery in the mid- to high latitudes. If the O<sub>3</sub> 
  losses are at their maximum or will reach a maximum within the next decade, 
  then the forcing may not become much more negative (i.e., it was -0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  for just the 1980s; inclusion of the 1990s increases the magnitude by about 
  50%). And, as the O<sub>3</sub> layer recovers, the forcing may remain static, 
  eventually tending to become less negative. At this time, there will be a lesser 
  offset of the positive greenhouse effects of the halocarbons and the other well-mixed 
  greenhouse gases (WMO, 1999). Solomon and Daniel (1996) point out that the global 
  mean stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> forcing can be expected to scale down substantially 
  in importance relative to the well-mixed greenhouse gases, in view of the former's 
  decline and the latter's sustained increase in concentrations. Note, however, 
  that the evolution of the negativity of the stratospheric O<sub>3 </sub>forcing 
  may vary considerably with latitude and season i.e., the recovery may not occur 
  at all locations and seasons at the same rate. Thus, the spatial and seasonal 
  evolution of forcing in the future requires as much scrutiny as the global mean 
  estimate.</p>
