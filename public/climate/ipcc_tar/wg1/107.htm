<h2>3.3 Palaeo CO<sub>2</sub> and Natural Changes in the Carbon Cycle </h2>
<h3><a name="331"></a>3.3.1 Geological History of Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
<p>Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has varied on all time-scales during 
  the Earth's history (<a href="105.htm#fig32">Figure 3.2</a>). There is 
  evidence for very high CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (&gt;3,000 ppm) between 
  600 and 400 Myr BP and between 200 and 150 Myr BP (<a href="105.htm#fig32">Figure 
  3.2f</a>). On long time-scales, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> content is determined 
  by the balance among geochemical processes including organic carbon burial in 
  sediments, silicate rock weathering, and vulcanism (Berner, 1993, 1997). In 
  particular, terrestrial vegetation has enhanced the rate of silicate weathering, 
  which consumes CO<sub>2</sub> while releasing base cations that end up in the 
  ocean. Subsequent deep-sea burial of Ca and Mg (as carbonates, for example CaCO<sub>3</sub>) 
  in the shells of marine organisms removes CO<sub>2</sub>. The net effect of 
  slight imbalances in the carbon cycle over tens to hundreds of millions of years 
  has been to reduce atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. The rates of these processes 
  are extremely slow, hence they are of limited relevance to the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  response to emissions over the next hundred years.</p>

<p><a name="fig33"></a>It is pertinent, however, that photosynthesis evolved at 
  a time when O<sub>2</sub> concentrations were far less than at present. O<sub>2</sub> 
  has accumulated in the atmosphere over geological time because photosynthesis 
  results in the burial of reduced chemical species: pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) 
  derived from sulphur-reducing bacteria, and organic carbon. This accumulation 
  has consequences for terrestrial and marine ecosystems today. Primary production 
  is carbon limited in terrestrial ecosystems in part because of (geologically 
  speaking) low CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, and in part because Rubisco (the 
  enzyme that fixes CO<sub>2</sub> in all plants) also has an affinity for O<sub>2</sub> 
  that reduces its efficiency in photosynthesis (see <a href="102.htm">Section 
  3.2.2.4</a>). Primary production is iron limited in some marine ecosystems mainly 
  because of the extreme insolubility of Fe(III), the predominant form of iron 
  in the present, O<sub>2</sub>-rich environment. These difficulties faced by 
  contemporary organisms represent a legacy of earlier evolution under very different 
  biogeochemical conditions.</p>
<p>In more recent times, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration continued to 
  fall after about 60 Myr BP and there is geochemical evidence that concentrations 
  were &lt;300 ppm by about 20 Myr BP (Pagani et al., 1999a; Pearson and Palmer, 
  1999, 2000; Figure 3.2e). Low CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations may have been the 
  stimulus that favoured the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> plants, which increased 
  greatly in abundance between 7 and 5 Myr BP (Cerling et al., 1993, 1997; Pagani 
  et al., 1999b). Although contemporary CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were exceeded 
  during earlier geological epochs, they are likely higher now than at any time 
  during the past 20 million years.</p>
<h3><a name="332"></a>3.3.2 Variations in Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during Glacial/inter-glacial 
  Cycles</h3>
<p>The purity of Antarctic ice allows the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in trapped 
  air bubbles to be accurately measured (Tschumi and Stauffer, 2000). The CO<sub>2</sub> 
  record from the Vostok ice core is the best available for the glacial/inter-glacial 
  time-scale and covers the past four glacial/inter-glacial cycles (420 kyr) with 
  a resolution of 1 to 2 kyr (Petit et al., 1999; Fischer et al., 1999). The general 
  pattern is clear (<a href="105.htm#fig32">Figure 3.2d</a>): atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  has been low (but <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/gtoe.gif" width="8" height="12">180 ppm) 
  during glacial periods, and higher (but <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/ltoe.gif" width="8" height="12">300 
  ppm) during interglacials. Natural processes during the glacial-interglacial 
  cycles have maintained CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations within these bounds, despite 
  considerable variability on multi-millenial time-scales. The present CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration is higher than at any time during the 420 kyr period covered by 
  the Vostok record.</p>
<p>The terrestrial biosphere stores 300 to 700 Pg more carbon during interglacial 
  periods than during glacial periods, based on a widely accepted interpretation 
  of the <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-s.gif" width="8" height="10"><sup>13</sup>C record 
  in deep-sea sediments (Shackleton, 1977; Bird et al., 1994; Crowley, 1995). 
  Terrestrial modelling studies (e.g., Friedlingstein et al., 1995b; Peng et al., 
  1998) have reached the same conclusion. Thus, the terrestrial biosphere does 
  not cause the difference in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> between glacial and interglacial 
  periods. The cause must lie in the ocean, and indeed the amount of atmospheric 
  change to be accounted for must be augmented to account for a fraction of the 
  carbon transferred between the land and ocean. The mechanism remains controversial 
  (see <a href="106.htm#box34">Box 3.4</a>). In part this is because a variety 
  of processes that could be effective in altering CO<sub>2</sub> levels on a 
  century time-scale can be largely cancelled on multi-millenial time-scales by 
  changes in CaCO<sub>3</sub> sedimentation or dissolution, as discussed in <a href="104.htm#3231">Section 
  3.2.3.1</a>.</p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 3.5: The use of O<sub>2</sub> measurements to 
        assess the fate of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub>. </b> </div>
      <p>The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that remains in the atmosphere each year 
        has been consistently less than the amount emitted by fossil fuel burning. 
        This is because some CO<sub>2</sub> dissolves and mixes in the ocean, 
        and some is taken up by the land. These two modes of uptake have different 
        effects on the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. Fossil 
        fuel burning consumes O<sub>2</sub> and causes a decline in atmospheric 
        O<sub>2</sub> concentration (<a href="108.htm#fig34">Figure 3.4</a>). 
        Dissolution of CO<sub>2</sub> in the ocean has no effect on atmospheric 
        O<sub>2</sub>. Terrestrial uptake of CO<sub>2</sub>, by contrast, implies 
        that photosynthesis (which releases O<sub>2</sub>) is exceeding respiration 
        and other oxidation processes, including fire (which consume O<sub>2</sub>). 
        Thus, net terrestrial uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> implies a net release of 
        O<sub>2</sub>, in a known stochiometric ratio. This difference can be 
        used to partition the total CO<sub>2</sub> uptake into land and ocean 
        components, as shown graphically in <a href="108.htm#fig34">Figure 3.4</a>. 
        Strictly speaking, the atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> - CO<sub>2</sub> 
        budget method can only distinguish between net non-biological ocean uptake 
        and net biospheric uptake, which in principle includes both the terrestrial 
        and the marine biosphere. However, since biological oxygen uptake is not 
        expected to have changed significantly during recent decades because of 
        nutrient limitations in most parts of the ocean (see <a href="105.htm">Section 
        3.2.3.2</a>), this inferred biospheric uptake is attributed to the land.</p>
      <p>Measurement of changes in O<sub>2</sub> presents a technical challenge 
        because changes of a few ppm caused by fossil fuel burning have to be 
        determined against a background concentration of 209,000 ppm (about 21%). 
        For technical reasons, O<sub>2</sub> is measured relative to N<sub>2</sub>, 
        the main constituent of the atmosphere, as a reference gas. For simplicity 
        this chapter refers to O<sub>2</sub> concentrations, although strictly 
        it is O<sub>2</sub> : N<sub>2</sub> ratios that are measured. The impact 
        of nitrification-denitrification changes on atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> 
        content are assumed not to be problematic because they are small and the 
        inventory of N<sub>2</sub> is very large. Increases in ocean temperatures 
        (Levitus et al., 2000), because of their effect on the temperature dependent 
        solubility, induce small outgassing fluxes of O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> 
        (Keeling et al., 1993) that have to be taken into account (see <a href="108.htm#fig34">Figure 
        3.4</a>) although their magnitude is only approximately known. Impacts 
        on atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> caused by changes in the ventilation of deeper, 
        oxygen depleted waters have been observed on interannual time-scales (Keeling 
        et al., 1993, Bender et al., 1996). They could also occur on longer time-scales, 
        e.g., through increased ocean stratification induced by ocean warming.</p>

<p>Orbital variations (Berger, 1978) are the pacemaker of climate change on multi-millenial 
  time-scales (Hays et al., 1976). Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is one of many Earth 
  system variables that show the characteristic "Milankovitch" periodicities, 
  and has been implicated as a key factor in locking natural climate changes to 
  the 100 kyr eccentricity cycle (Shackleton, 2000). Whatever the mechanisms involved, 
  lags of up to 2,000 to 4,000 years in the drawdown of CO<sub>2</sub> at the 
  start of glacial periods suggests that the low CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  during glacial periods amplify the climate change but do not initiate glaciations 
  (Lorius and Oeschger, 1994; Fischer et al., 1999). Once established, the low 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is likely to have enhanced global cooling (Hewitt 
  and Mitchell, 1997). During the last deglaciation, rising CO<sub>2</sub> paralleled 
  Southern Hemisphere warming and was ahead of Northern Hemisphere warming (<a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>). </p>
<p>During glacial periods, the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration does not 
  track the "fast" changes in climate (e.g., decade to century scale 
  warming events) associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger events, although there are 
  CO<sub>2</sub> fluctuations of up to 20 ppm associated with the longer-lived 
  events (Stauffer et al., 1998; Inderm&uuml;hle et al., 2000) (see Chapter 2 
  for explanations of these terms). During the last deglaciation, atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration continued to increase, by about 12 ppm, through 
  the Younger Dryas cold reversal (12.7 to 11.6 kyr BP) seen in Northern Hemisphere 
  palaeoclimate records (Fischer et al., 1999; Smith et al., 1999). Palaeo-oceanographic 
  evidence shows that the Younger Dryas event was marked by a prolonged shut-down 
  of the thermohaline circulation, which is likely to have been triggered by the 
  release of melt water into the North Atlantic. Similar behaviour, with a slight 
  rise in CO<sub>2</sub> accompanying a major Northern Hemisphere cooling and 
  shutdown of North Atlantic Deep Water production, has been produced in a coupled 
  atmosphere-ocean model (Marchal et al., 1998). The observed CO<sub>2</sub> rise 
  during the Younger Dryas period was modest, suggesting that atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  has, under natural conditions, been well buffered against abrupt changes in 
  climate, including thermohaline collapse. This buffering is a direct consequence 
  of the large reservoir of DIC in the ocean.</p>
