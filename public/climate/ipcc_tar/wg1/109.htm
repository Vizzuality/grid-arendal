<h2>3.4 Anthropogenic Sources of CO<sub>2</sub></h2>
<h3><a name="341"></a>3.4.1 Emissions from Fossil Fuel Burning and Cement Production</h3>
<p>Current anthropogenic emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> are primarily the result 
  of the consumption of energy from fossil fuels. Estimates of annual global emissions 
  from fossil fuel burning and cement production have been made for the period 
  from 1751 through 1999. <a href="107.htm#fig33">Figure 3.3</a> summarises emissions 
  over the period from 1959 to 1999 (Keeling and Whorf, 2000).</p>
<p>Estimates of annual global emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement production 
  by Marland et al. (2000) span the period from 1751 through to 1997, reaching 
  a maximum in 1997 of 6.6 PgC/yr (0.2 PgC/yr of this was from cement production). 
  The primary data for these estimates are annual energy statistics compiled by 
  the United Nations (2000). Emissions for 1998 and 1999 have been estimated based 
  on energy statistics compiled by British Petroleum (2000). Emission factors 
  (IPCC, 1997) were applied to consumption statistics (British Petroleum, 2000) 
  to calculate emissions over the period 1990 to 1999. Emissions were then scaled 
  to match the estimates for emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement production 
  from Marland et al. (2000) over the overlap period from 1990 to 1997. The scaled 
  emission estimates, therefore, implicitly include emissions from cement production. 
</p>
<p>The average value of emissions for the 1980s given by Marland et al. (2000) 
  is 5.44 &plusmn; 0.3 PgC/yr, revised from the earlier estimate (Marland et al. 
  1994; Andres et al. 2000) of 5.46 &plusmn; 0.3 PgC/yr used in the SAR and in 
  the Special Report on Radiative Forcing (IPCC, 1994) (hereafter SRRF). Estimated 
  emissions rose from 6.1 PgC/yr in 1990 to 6.5 PgC/yr in 1999. The average value 
  of emissions in the 1990s was 6.3 &plusmn; 0.4 PgC/yr.</p>
<h3><a name="342"></a>3.4.2 Consequences of Land-use Change</h3>
<p>About 10 to 30% of the current total anthropogenic emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  are estimated to be caused by land-use conversion. Such estimates rely on land 
  cover data sets which are highly variable, and estimates of average carbon density 
  of vegetation types, which are also highly variable with stand age and local 
  conditions (see <a href="098.htm#box31">Box 3.1</a>). Hence they cannot be specified 
  as accurately as is possible for fossil fuel emissions. Historical emissions 
  are treated in <a href="100.htm">Section 3.2.2.2</a>; this section focuses on 
  the contemporary situation.</p>
<p>Net land-use flux, comprising the balance of positive terms due to deforestation 
  and negative terms due to regrowth on abandoned agricultural land, has been 
  estimated based on land-use statistics and simple models of rates of decomposition 
  and regrowth, excluding possible climate, CO<sub>2</sub> and N fertilisation 
  effects (Houghton, 1999). Not all land-use emissions are included, for example 
  mining of peatlands. The analysis of Houghton (1999) indicated that the net 
  flux due to land-use change was 2.0 &plusmn; 0.8 PgC/yr during the 1980s, almost 
  entirely due to deforestation of tropical regions. Temperate forests were found 
  to show an approximate balance between carbon uptake in regrowing forests and 
  carbon lost in oxidation of wood products, except in Europe, which showed a 
  small net accumulation. The estimate of 2.0 PgC/yr is somewhat higher than Houghton 
  and Hackler's (1995) earlier estimate of 1.6 PgC/yr for the same period, 
  which was used in the SAR, because of a reanalysis of data from tropical Asia 
  (Houghton and Hackler, 1999). However, other recent analyses by the same authors 
  reduce the estimated emissions from the Brazilian Amazon by half (Houghton et 
  al., 2000), and point to other previously unaccounted for sinks of carbon in 
  the USA such as fire suppression and woody encroachment, and changes in the 
  management of agricultural soils (Houghton et al., 1999). Consideration of these 
  additional studies brings the overall total back down to 1.7 &plusmn; 0.8 PgC/yr 
  (Houghton, 2000), as given in the SRLULUCF.</p>
<p>An independent analysis (see <a href="116.htm">Section 3.6.2.2</a>) by the 
  Carbon Cycle Model Linkage Project (CCMLP) also calculated the marginal effects 
  of land-use changes on the global terrestrial carbon budget (McGuire et al., 
  2001). Land-use change data (conversions between native vegetation and crops) 
  were derived from Ramankutty and Foley (2000). The estimates obtained for net 
  land-use flux during the 1980s were between 0.6 and 1.0 PgC/yr, i.e., substantially 
  smaller than the fluxes calculated by Houghton (1999). The reasons for this 
  discrepancy are unclear. The CCMLP estimates may be too low because they neglected 
  conversions to pasture. However, data presented in Houghton (1999) indicate 
  that the main changes during recent decades were due to land conversion for 
  crops. A more important difference may lie in the timing of deforestation in 
  different regions in the tropics, where Ramankutty and Foley (2000) show higher 
  overall rates in the 1970s and lower rates in the 1980s than Houghton does (1999). 
</p>
<p>Another analysis calculated a substantially higher net source due to land-use 
  change in the tropics of 2.4 &plusmn; 1.0 PgC/yr during the 1980s (Fearnside, 
  2000). This analysis did not deal with temperate regions, and is not used in 
  the global budget estimates. <br>
  No complete global assessment of deforestation effects covering the 1990s is 
  available. Rates of deforestation appear to be declining. The FAO (1997) tropical 
  forest assessment reported annual losses of 15.5x10<sup>6</sup> ha in the 1980s, 
  and 13.7x10<sup>6</sup> ha in 1990 to 1995. Independent studies show a significant 
  decline in deforestation rates in the Amazon region (Skole and Tucker, 1993; 
  Fearnside, 2000). The annual flux of carbon from land-use change for the period 
  from 1990 to 1995 has been estimated to be 1.6 PgC/yr from 1990 to 1995, consisting 
  of a source of 1.7 PgC/yr in the tropics and a small sink in temperate and boreal 
  areas (Houghton, 2000).</p>
