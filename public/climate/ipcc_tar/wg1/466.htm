<h2>12.5 Remaining Uncertainties </h2>
<p>The SAR identified a number of factors that limited the degree to which any 
  human influence on climate could be quantified. It was noted that detection 
  and attribution of anthropogenic climate change signals would be accomplished 
  through a gradual accumulation of evidence, and that there were appreciable 
  uncertainties in the magnitude and patterns of natural variability, and in the 
  radiative forcing and climate response resulting from human activity.</p>
<p>The SAR predicted an increase in the anthropogenic contribution to global mean 
  temperature of slightly over 0.1&deg;C in the five years following the SAR, 
  which is consistent with the observed change since the SAR (Chapter 2). The 
  predicted increase in the anthropogenic signal (and the observed change) are 
  small compared to natural variability, so it is not possible to distinguish 
  an anthropogenic signal from natural variability on five year time-scales.</p>
<p><i>Differences in surface and free atmosphere temperature trends</i><br>
  There are unresolved differences between the observed and modelled temperature 
  variations in the free atmosphere. These include apparent changes in the temperature 
  difference between the surface and the lower atmosphere, and differences in 
  the tropical upper troposphere. While model simulations of large-scale changes 
  in free atmospheric and surface temperatures are generally consistent with the 
  observed changes, simulated and observed trends in troposphere minus surface 
  temperature differences are not consistent. It is not clear whether this is 
  due to model or observational error, or neglected forcings in the models.</p>
<p><i>Internal climate variability</i><br>
  The precise magnitude of natural internal climate variability remains uncertain. 
  The amplitude of internal variability in the models most often used in detection 
  studies differs by up to a factor of two from that seen in the instrumental 
  temperature record on annual to decadal time-scales, with some models showing 
  similar or larger variability than observed (<a href="445.htm">Section 12.2</a>; 
  <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>). However, the instrumental record is only marginally 
  useful for validating model estimates of variability on the multi-decadal time-scales 
  that are relevant for detection. Some palaeoclimatic reconstructions of temperature 
  suggest that multi-decadal variability in the pre-industrial era was higher 
  than that generated internally by models (<a href="445.htm">Section 12.2</a>; 
  <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>). However, apart from the difficulties inherent 
  in reconstructing temperature accurately from proxy data, the palaeoclimatic 
  record also includes the climatic response to natural forcings arising, for 
  example, from variations in solar output and volcanic activity. Including the 
  estimated forcing due to natural factors increases the longer-term variability 
  simulated by models, while eliminating the response to external forcing from 
  the palaeo-record brings palaeo-variability estimates closer to model-based 
  estimates (Crowley, 2000). </p>
<p><i>Natural forcing</i><br>
  Estimates of natural forcing have now been included in simulations over the 
  period of the instrumental temperature record. Natural climate variability (forced 
  and/or internally generated) on its own is generally insufficient to explain 
  the observed changes in temperature over the last few decades. However, for 
  all but the most recent two decades, the accuracy of the estimates of forcing 
  may be limited, being based entirely on proxy data for solar irradiance and 
  on limited surface data for volcanoes. There are some indications that solar 
  irradiance fluctuations have indirect effects in addition to direct radiative 
  heating, for example due to the substantially stronger variation in the UV band 
  and its effect on ozone, or hypothesised changes in cloud cover (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>). These mechanisms remain particularly uncertain and currently are not 
  incorporated in most efforts to simulate the climate effect of solar irradiance 
  variations, as no quantitative estimates of their magnitude are currently available.</p>
<p><i>Anthropogenic forcing</i><br>
  The representation of greenhouse gases and the effect of sulphate aerosols has 
  been improved in models. However, some of the smaller forcings, including those 
  due to biomass burning and changes in land use, have not been taken into account 
  in formal detection studies. The major uncertainty in anthropogenic forcing 
  arises from the indirect effects of aerosols. The global mean forcing is highly 
  uncertain (<a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>, <a href="254.htm#fig68">Figure 6.8</a>). 
  The estimated forcing patterns vary from a predominantly Northern Hemisphere 
  forcing similar to that due to direct aerosol effects (Tett et al., 2000) to 
  a more globally uniform distribution, similar but opposite in sign to that associated 
  with changes in greenhouse gases (Roeckner et al., 1999). If the response to 
  indirect forcing has a component which can be represented as a linear combination 
  of the response to greenhouse gases and to the direct forcing by aerosols, it 
  will influence amplitudes of the responses to these two factors estimated through 
  optimal detection. </p>
<p><i>Estimates of response patterns</i><br>
  Finally, there remains considerable uncertainty in the amplitude and pattern 
  of the climate response to changes in radiative forcing. The large uncertainty 
  in climate sensitivity, 1.5 to 4.5&deg;C for a doubling of atmospheric carbon 
  dioxide, has not been reduced since the SAR, nor is it likely to be reduced 
  in the near future by the evidence provided by the surface temperature signal 
  alone. In contrast, the emerging signal provides a relatively strong constraint 
  on forecast transient climate change under some emission scenarios. Some techniques 
  can allow for errors in the magnitude of the simulated global mean response 
  in attribution studies. As noted in <a href="445.htm">Section 12.2</a>, there 
  is greater pattern similarity between simulations of greenhouse gases alone, 
  and of greenhouse gases and aerosols using the same model, than between simulations 
  of the response to the same change in greenhouse gases using different models. 
  This leads to some inconsistency in the estimation of the separate greenhouse 
  gas and aerosol components using different models (see<a href="460.htm"> Section 
  12.4.3</a>).</p>
<p>In summary, some progress has been made in reducing uncertainty, particularly 
  with respect to distinguishing the responses to different external influences 
  using multi-pattern techniques and in quantifying the magnitude of the modelled 
  and observed responses. Nevertheless, many of the sources of uncertainty identified 
  in the SAR still remain. </p>
