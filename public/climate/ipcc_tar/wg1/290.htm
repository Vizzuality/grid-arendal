<p> The third generation LSPs combine biology and atmospheric physics in an economical 
  and plausible way and require fewer parameters than their empirical predecessors 
  (Bonan, 1995; Sellers et al., 1996c; Dickinson et al., 1998). Equally important, 
  these models provide more opportunities for parameter calibration, constraint, 
  process sub-model validation and "upscaling" algorithm verification 
  through comparison with observations. This is because a powerful range of carbon-related 
  and physiological fluxes and variables may be added to the physical climate 
  system parameters conventionally used for LSP validation (Colello et al., 1998; 
  Delire and Foley, 1999). It has also been found that the leaf-level physiological 
  photosynthesis-conductance models developed and tested under laboratory and 
  field conditions can be spatially integrated to describe processes over large 
  areas using routine satellite observations. Over the last few years, satellite 
  measurements have been used to construct global data sets of vegetation type 
  and other surface parameters at monthly time resolution and one degree spatial 
  resolution or better (Sellers et al., 1996b). Most importantly, these data sets 
  are globally consistent in that they are primarily based on one type of satellite 
  sensor and one set of interpretative algorithms. Satellite observations also 
  provide a powerful diagnostic capability for tracking climatic impacts on surface 
  conditions; e.g., droughts and the recently observed lengthening of the boreal 
  growing season; and direct anthropogenic impacts, e.g., deforestation. Validation 
  of the process models, upscaling methodologies and the satellite algorithms 
  used to define global parameter fields, has been achieved through a series of 
  large-scale field experiments (Andre et al., 1986; Sellers et al., 1992b; Bolle 
  et al., 1993; Goutorbe, 1994; Sellers et al., 1995). In every environment studied 
  so far (mid-latitude grassland and forest, boreal forest, arid zones) these 
  methods have been used to calculate regional land-atmosphere flux fields that 
  concur with satellite observations and fluxes measured by surface rigs and low 
  flying aircraft (Cihlar et al., 1992; Desjardins et al., 1992; Sellers et al., 
  1992c).</p>
<p> The field experiments have provided other significant benefits to the modelling 
  community: LSPs in NWP models have been enhanced, leading to direct improvements 
  in precipitation and cloudiness prediction over the continents (Beljaars et 
  al., 1996; Betts et al., 1996), and large biases in some NWP surface parameter 
  fields, for example winter albedo in the boreal forest, have been corrected 
  (Betts et al., 1998). Climate modellers have similarly used the results from 
  field experiments to improve process sub-models (Shao and Henderson-Sellers, 
  1996), global parameter sets (Sellers et al., 1996b), and to develop better 
  methods for dealing with land-surface spatial heterogeneity (Avissar, 1998; 
  Avissar et al., 1998). Model validation and intercomparison tests have used 
  field experiment data sets to baseline the performance of LSPs within a rigorous 
  intercomparison framework (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>, <a href="322.htm">Section 
  8.5.4</a>). </p>
<p> While there has been considerable success in upscaling process sub-models 
  and parameter sets to describe continental-scale fluxes and states, there remain 
  some difficult areas, notably the treatment of heterogeneous landscapes, soil 
  water transport and catchment hydrology (see <a href="292.htm">Section 7.4.3</a>); 
  the treatment of snow (see <a href="294.htm">Section 7.5.1</a>); and the coupling 
  of LSPs with atmospheric boundary-layer models (see <a href="266.htm">Section 
  7.2</a>). Sophisticated scaling methodologies are needed to deal with the many 
  non-linear components in these systems and accurate, realistic modelling of 
  these processes on a large scale is likely to remain a challenge for some time 
  to come.</p>
<p> Global biogeochemical models have been developed independently of LSPs to 
  investigate carbon cycling by the terrestrial biosphere (e.g., Field et al., 
  1995; Foley et al., 1996, 1998; Cao and Woodward, 1998; Kicklighter et al., 
  1998; see also <a href="095.htm">Chapter 3</a>). Biogeochemical models are now 
  being coupled with LSPs so that a complete, internally consistent carbon balance 
  can be performed along with conventional surface energy balance calculations 
  (see also <a href="291.htm">Section 7.4.2</a>). Changes in the isotopic fractions 
  of key gases as a result of interactions with the veg-etation physiology can 
  also be calculated (Ciais et al., 1997; Fung et al., 1997; Randerson and Thompson, 
  1999) and preliminary work is under way to calculate dry deposition rates and 
  thus refine calculations of the global tropospheric budget of O<sub>3</sub> 
  and reactive N-species within LSPs.</p>
<p> The eventual result should be powerful, internally consistent, model combinations 
  that will be capable of simulating the influence of the physical climate system 
  on the terrestrial carbon cycle, and vice versa. This kind of model will be 
  important for realistic simulation of the global climate out beyond a few decades, 
  during which carbon cycle-climate interactions could significantly influence 
  the rate of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increase, the nature and extent of the physical 
  climate system response, and ultimately, the response of the biosphere itself 
  to global change. Furthermore, the performance of such models can be checked, 
  or constrained, by a combination of conventional physical climate system observations, 
  atmospheric gas and isotope fraction concentrations, and satellite data.</p>
<p> Many scientific and technical problems must be solved to achieve these goals. 
  <a href="291.htm">Sections 7.4.2</a>, <a href="292.htm">7.4.3</a> and <a href="294.htm">7.5.1</a> 
  cover some particular issues that will be important for the construction of 
  realistic, accurate LSPs in the future.</p>
