<h4>13.2.2.2 Temporal analogues</h4>
<p>Temporal analogues make use of climatic information from the past as an analogue 
  for possible future climate (Webb and Wigley, 1985; Pittock, 1993). They are 
  of two types: palaeo-climatic analogues and instrumentally based analogues.</p>
<p>Palaeoclimatic analogues are based on reconstructions of past climate from 
  fossil evidence, such as plant or animal remains and sedimentary deposits. Two 
  periods have received particular attention (Budyko, 1989; Shabalova and K&ouml;nnen, 
  1995): the mid-Holocene (about 5 to 6 ky BP<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn13.htm#2","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>2</sup></small></a>) and the Last (Eemian) Interglacial 
  (about 120 to 130 ky BP). During these periods, mean global temperatures were 
  as warm as or warmer than today (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="075.htm">Section 
  2.4.4</a>), perhaps resembling temperatures anticipated during the 21st century. 
  Palaeoclimatic analogues have been adopted extensively in the former Soviet 
  Union (e.g., Frenzel et al., 1992; Velichko et al., 1995a,b; Anisimov and Nelson, 
  1996), as well as elsewhere (e.g., Kellogg and Schware, 1981; Pittock and Salinger, 
  1982). The major disadvantage of using palaeoclimatic analogues for climate 
  scenarios is that the causes of past changes in climate (e.g., variations in 
  the Earth's orbit about the Sun; continental configuration) are different 
  from those posited for the enhanced greenhouse effect, and the resulting regional 
  and seasonal patterns of climate change may be quite different (Crowley, 1990; 
  Mitchell, 1990). There are also large uncertainties about the quality of many 
  palaeoclimatic reconstructions (Covey, 1995). However, these scenarios remain 
  useful for providing insights about the vulnerability of systems to abrupt climate 
  change (e.g., Severinghaus et al., 1998) and to past El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern 
  Oscillation (ENSO) extremes (e.g., Fagan, 1999; Rodbell et al., 1999). They 
  also can provide valuable information for testing the ability of climate models 
  to reproduce past climate fluctuations (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>).</p>
<p>Periods of observed global scale warmth during the historical period have also 
  been used as analogues of a greenhouse gas induced warmer world (Wigley et al., 
  1980). Such scenarios are usually constructed by estimating the difference between 
  the regional climate during the warm period and that of the long-term average 
  or a similarly selected cold period (e.g., Lough et al., 1983). An alternative 
  approach is to select the past period on the basis not only of the observed 
  climatic conditions but also of the recorded impacts (e.g., Warrick, 1984; Williams 
  et al., 1988; Rosenberg et al., 1993; Lapin et al., 1995). A further method 
  employs observed atmospheric circulation patterns as analogues (e.g., Wilby 
  et al., 1994). The advantage of the analogue approach is that the changes in 
  climate were actually observed and so, by definition, are internally consistent 
  and physically plausible. Moreover, the approach can yield useful insights into 
  past sensitivity and adaptation to climatic variations (Magalh&atilde;es and 
  Glantz, 1992). The major objection to these analogues is that climate anomalies 
  during the past century have been fairly minor compared to anticipated future 
  changes, and in many cases the anomalies were probably associated with naturally 
  occurring changes in atmospheric circulation rather than changes in greenhouse 
  gas concentrations (e.g., Glantz, 1988; Pittock, 1989).</p>
