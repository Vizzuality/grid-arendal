<h4>10.5.1.3 Climate variability and extreme events</h4>
<p>A number of studies have investigated the interannual variability in RCM simulations 
  driven by analyses of observations over different regions (e.g., L&uuml;thi 
  et al., 1996 for Europe; Giorgi et al., 1996 and Giorgi and Shields 1999 for 
  the continental USA; Sun et al., 1999 for East Africa; Small et al., 1999a for 
  central Asia; Rinke et al., 1999 for the Arctic; van Lipzig, 1999 for Antarctica). 
  These show that RCMs can reproduce well interannual anomalies of precipitation 
  and surface air temperature, both in sign and magnitude, over sub-regions varying 
  in size from a few hundred kilometres to about 1,000 km (<a href="#fig1011">Figure 
  10.11</a>).</p>
<p>At the intra-seasonal scale, the timing and positioning of regional climatological 
  features such as the East Asia rain belt and the Baiu front can be reproduced 
  with a high degree of realism with an RCM (Fu et al., 1998). A good simulation 
  of the intra-seasonal evolution of precipitation during the short rain season 
  of East Africa has also been documented (Sun et al., 1999). However, at shorter 
  time-scales, Dai et al. (1999) found that, despite a good simulation of average 
  precipitation, significant problems were exhibited by an RCM simulation of the 
  observed diurnal cycle of precipitation over different regions of the USA.<br>
  Only a few examples are available of analysis of variability in RCMs driven 
  by GCMs. At the intra-seasonal scale, Bhaskaran et al. (1998) showed that the 
  leading mode of sub-seasonal variability of the South Asia monsoon, a 30 to 
  50 day oscillation of circulation and precipitation anomalies, was more realistically 
  captured by an RCM than the driving GCM. Hassell and Jones (1999) then showed 
  that a nested RCM captured observed precipitation anomalies in the active break 
  phases of the South Asia monsoon (5 to 10 periods of anomalous circulations 
  and precipitation) that were absent from the driving GCM (<a href="#fig1012">Figure 
  10.12</a>).</p>
<p>At the daily time-scale, some studies have shown that nested RCMs tend to simulate 
  too many light precipitation events compared with station data (Christensen 
  et al. 1998; Kato et al., 2001). However, RCMs produce more realistic statistics 
  of heavy precipitation events than the driving GCMs, sometimes capturing extreme 
  events entirely absent in the GCMs (Christensen et al., 1998; Jones, 1999). 
  Part of this is due to the inherent disaggregation of grid-box mean values resulting 
  from the RCM's higher horizontal resolution. However, in one study, even 
  when aggregated to the GCM grid scale, the RCM was closer to observations than 
  the driving GCM (Durman et al., 2001). </p>

            simulated with RCMs driven by analyses of observations over different

            for the seasonal value for the entire simulation. (a) (top) Northwestern 
            USA (NW), and (bottom) Upper Mississippi Basin (UMB) for a three year 
            simulation (1993 to 1996) over the continental USA. The three pairs 
            of observed (hollow bars) and simulated (solid bars) anomalies for 
            each season are grouped in sequential order from 1993 to 1996. Units 
            are percentage of the three-year seasonal average (from Giorgi and 
            Shields, 1999, Figure 9). (b) Precipitation anomalies for twelve short-rains 
            periods over Tanzania for the October-December season: (top) model
