<h4><b><i>Changes in temperature during the pre-instrumental period </i></b> </h4>
<p><i>The past millennium</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>New analyses indicate that the magnitude of Northern Hemisphere warming 
    over the 20th century is likely to have been the largest of any century in 
    the last 1,000 years. </li>
  <li>The 1990s are likely to have been the warmest decade of the millennium in 
    the Northern Hemisphere and 1998 is likely to have been the warmest year. 
    Because less data are available, less is known about annual averages prior 
    to 1,000 years before the present and for conditions prevailing in most of 
    the Southern Hemisphere prior to 1861.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Evidence does not support the existence of globally synchronous periods 
    of cooling or warming associated with the &#145;Little Ice Age' and &#145;Medieval 
    Warm Period'. However, reconstructed Northern Hemisphere temperatures do show 
    a cooling during the 15th to 19th centuries and a relatively warm period during 
    the 11th to 14th centuries, though the latter period is still cooler than 
    the late 20th century. </li>
  <li>Analyses of borehole temperatures indicate a non-linear increase in global 
    average ground surface temperature over land of 1.0 &plusmn; 0.3&deg;C over 
    the last 500 years, with most of the increase occurring since the late 19th 
    century. There may be additional uncertainties due to the assumptions used 
    in this technique, and decreasing resolution back in time limits confidence 
    in the exact timing of the warming.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Changes across the last 500,000 years</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>It is very likely that large and rapid decadal temperature changes occurred 
    during the last glacial and its deglaciation (between about 100,000 and 10,000 
    years ago), particularly in higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. During 
    the last deglaciation, local increases in temperature are likely to have been 
    as large as 5 to 10&deg;C over a few decades. Over the same period there is 
    evidence of less pronounced but nearly synchronous changes worldwide, except 
    in high southern latitudes. </li>
  <li>Antarctic ice cores have provided new evidence of almost in-phase changes 
    of temperature, carbon dioxide and methane through the ice age cycles over 
    the past 420,000 years. <br>
  </li>
  <li>There is emerging evidence for significant, rapid (time-scales of several 
    decades or more), regional temperature changes during the last 10,000 years. 
    However, the evidence does not indicate that any such events were global in 
    scale. </li>
</ul>
<h4><i>Changes in Precipitation and Related Variables</i></h4>
<p><i>Precipitation</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Instrumental records of land-surface precipitation continue to show an increase 
    of 0.5 to 1%/decade in much of the Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes. 
    A notable exception includes parts of eastern Russia. In contrast, over much 
    of the sub-tropical land areas rainfall has decreased during the 20th century 
    (by -0.3%/decade), but this trend has weakened in recent decades. Other precipitation 
    indicators suggest that large parts of the tropical oceans have had more precipitation 
    in recent decades, and that precipitation has significantly increased over 
    tropical land areas during the 20th century (2.4%/century). The increase in 
    precipitation over the tropics is not evident during the past few decades.</li>
  <li>In the Southern Hemisphere, the pattern of island rainfall in parts of the 
    South Pacific has changed since the mid-1970s, associated with the more frequent 
    occurrence of the warm phase of the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).</li>
  <li>Where data are available, changes in annual streamflow usually relate well 
    to changes in total precipitation. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Water vapour</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Changes in water vapour mixing ratio have been analysed for selected regions 
    using in situ surface observations as well as lower-tropospheric measurements 
    based on satellites and weather balloons. A pattern of overall surface and 
    lower-tropospheric water vapour mixing ratio increases over the past few decades 
    is emerging, although there are likely to be some time-dependent biases in 
    these data and regional variations in trends. The more reliable data sets 
    show that it is likely that total atmospheric water vapour has increased several 
    per cent per decade over many regions of the Northern Hemisphere since the 
    early 1970s. Changes over the Southern Hemisphere cannot yet be assessed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Satellite observations of upper-tropospheric humidity from 1980 to 1997 
    show statistically significant positive trends of 0.1%/year for the zone 10&deg;N 
    to 10&deg;S. Other trends are not statistically significant, but include a 
    0.04%/year positive trend for the zone 60&deg;N to 60&deg;S but a negative 
    trend of -0.1%/year over the region 30&deg;S to 60&deg;S.</li>
  <li>Balloon observations of stratospheric water vapour above 18 km show an increase 
    of about 1%/year for the period from 1981 to 2000. Shorter satellite records 
    show a similar positive trend, suggesting that the change is global in character, 
    but they also indicate a slowing of the positive trend after 1996. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Clouds</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>It is likely that there has been an increase in total cloud cover of about 
    2% over many mid- to high latitude land areas since the beginning of the 20th 
    century. The increases in total cloud amount are positively correlated with 
    decreases in the diurnal temperature range. Changes in total cloud amount 
    are uncertain both over sub-tropical and tropical land areas as well as over 
    the oceans.</li>
</ul>
<h4><i><b>Changes in Atmospheric/Oceanic Circulation</b></i></h4>
<p><i>El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>The frequency and intensity of ENSO has been unusual since the mid-1970s 
    compared with the previous 100 years. Warm phase ENSO episodes have been relatively 
    more frequent, persistent, or intense than the opposite cold phase during 
    this period. </li>
  <li>This recent behaviour of ENSO is related to variations in precipitation 
    and temperature over much of the global tropics and sub-tropics and some mid-latitude 
    areas. The overall effect is likely to have made a small contribution to the 
    increase in global surface temperature during the last few decades. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Other Oscillations</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation is likely to be a Pacific-wide manifestation 
    of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Both are associated with decadal climate 
    variability over the Pacific basin. It is likely that these related phenomena 
    modulate ENSO-related climate variability.</li>
  <li>The winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the associated Arctic Oscillation 
    (AO), which appear to be largely the same phenomenon, show decadal to multi-decadal 
    variability. Since the 1970s these oscillations have been in a phase that 
    gives stronger westerly winds over much of extra-tropical Eurasia in the winter 
    half year. This is associated with cold season warming over extra-tropical 
    Eurasia, but cooling in some regions further south. </li>
  <li>The High Latitude Mode (HLM) or Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) in the Southern 
    Hemisphere has been in an enhanced positive phase in the last fifteen years, 
    with stronger westerly winds over the Southern Ocean. </li>
  <li>It is likely that rapid (time-scales of several decades or more) changes 
    of atmospheric and ocean circulation occurred during inter-glacial periods, 
    affecting regional climate, without human interference.</li>
</ul>
<h4><i><b>Changes in Extreme (within the upper or lower ten percentiles) Weather 
  and Climate Events</b></i></h4>
<p><i>Precipitation</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>New analyses show that in regions where total precipitation has increased 
    it is very likely that there have been even more pronounced increases in heavy 
    and extreme precipitation events. The converse is also true. <br>
  </li>
  <li>In some regions, heavy and extreme precipitation events have increased despite 
    the fact that total precipitation has decreased or remained constant. This 
    is attributed to a decrease in the frequency of precipitation events. Changes 
    in the frequency of heavy precipitation events can arise from several causes, 
    e.g., changes in atmospheric moisture or circulation.</li>
  <li>Over the latter half of the 20th century it is likely that there has been 
    a 2 to 4% increase in the frequency of heavy precipitation events reported 
    by the available observing stations in the mid- and high latitudes of the 
    Northern Hemisphere.</li>
  <li>Trends for severe drought and wet area statistics for 1900 to 1995 are relatively 
    small over global land areas. However, during the last two or three decades 
    there have been some increases in the globally combined severe dry and wet 
    areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Temperature</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>In many regions inter-daily temperature variability has decreased. Increases 
    in the daily minimum temperatures are lengthening the freeze-free season in 
    most mid- and high latitude regions. </li>
  <li>A significant reduction in the frequency of extreme low monthly and seasonal 
    average temperatures across much of the globe has occurred since the late 
    19th century. However, a relatively smaller increase in the frequency of extreme 
    high monthly and seasonal average temperatures has been observed.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Storms</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Changes in tropical and extra-tropical storm intensity and frequency are 
    dominated by inter-decadal to multi-decadal variations, with no significant 
    trends over the 20th century evident. Conflicting analyses make it difficult 
    to draw definitive conclusions about changes in storm activity, especially 
    in the extra-tropics.</li>
  <li> No systematic changes in the frequency of tornadoes, thunder days, or hail 
    events are evident in the limited areas analysed.</li>
