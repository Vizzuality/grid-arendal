<h4>6.8.3.3 Mineral dust aerosols</h4>
<p>Levin et al. (1996) observed desert dust particles coated with sulphate. Such 
  particles may originate from in-cloud scavenging of interstitial dust particles 
  followed by evaporation of the cloud droplets, condensation of SO<sub>2</sub> onto dust 
  followed by oxidation, or even coagulation of dust and sulphate particles. The 
  presence of soluble material (which may be of anthropogenic origin) on the desert 
  dust particles converts them into large and effective CCN which may affect the 
  cloud microphysics. Whether this effect results in a significant climate forcing 
  has not been investigated and cannot presently be quantified.</p>
<h4><a name="6834"></a>6.8.3.4 Effect of gas-phase nitric acid</h4>
<p>Kulmala et al. (1993, 1995, 1998) argued that enhanced concentrations of condensable 
  vapours (such as HNO<sub>3</sub> and HCl) in the atmosphere could affect cloud properties 
  by facilitating the activation of cloud condensation nuclei. The impact of such 
  an effect on the planetary cloud albedo has not been assessed.</p>
<h3><a name="684"></a>6.8.4 Indirect Methods for Estimating the Indirect Aerosol 
  Effect</h3>
<h4><a name="6841"></a>6.8.4.1 The "missing" climate forcing</h4>
<p>Hansen and colleagues have used two alternative approaches to characterise 
  and quantify any "missing" climate forcing besides that due to greenhouse 
  gases, solar constant, O<sub>3</sub>, and aerosol direct effect. Hansen et al. (1995) used 
  a simplified GCM to investigate the impacts of various climate forcings on the 
  diurnal cycle of surface air temperature and compared them with observations. 
  They found that, although the aerosol direct effect or an increase in continental 
  cloud albedo could contribute to damp the surface temperature diurnal cycle, 
  only an increase in continental cloud cover would be consistent with observations 
  (Karl et al., 1993). The required cloud increase depends on cloud height and 
  would be of the order of 1% global coverage for low clouds (i.e., 2 to 5% over 
  land). We cannot rule out that such a change is an unidentified cloud feedback 
  rather than a forcing. Hansen et al. (1997b) also argued that agreement between 
  observed and computed temperature trends requires the presence of another forcing 
  of at least -1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> which is inferred as being due to the indirect effect. In 
  their calculations, the direct tropo-spheric aerosol effect does not play a 
  large net role, because the moderately absorbing aerosol assumption leads to 
  an offset between its sunlight reflecting and absorbing properties insofar as 
  the top of the atmosphere irradiance change is concerned. However, this method 
  assumes that the observed change in temperature since pre-industrial times is 
  primarily a response to anthropogenic forcings, that all the other anthropogenic 
  forcings are well quantified, and that the climate sensitivity parameter (Section 
  6.1) predicted by the GCM is correct (Rodhe et al., 2000). Therefore it may 
  simply be a coincidence that the estimate of Hansen et al. (1997b) is consistent 
  with the GCM estimates discussed above.</p>
<h4><a name="6842"></a>6.8.4.2 Remote sensing of the indirect effect of aerosols</h4>
<p>Han et al. (1994) analysed AVHRR satellite radiances to retrieve the cloud 
  droplet size of low-level clouds. They reported significant inter-hemispheric 
  differences for both maritime and continental clouds. Boucher (1995) showed 
  that, if this difference is to be attributed to anthropogenic aerosols, it implies 
  a differential forcing of about -1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> between the two hemispheres. Assuming 
  a Northern Hemisphere to Southern Hemisphere ratio of 2:1 for the aerosol indirect 
  effect, this would imply a globally-averaged forcing of -1.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. It is not 
  clear, however, to what extent changes in cloud droplet size are related to 
  change in aerosol concentrations. For instance, Han et al. (1998) showed that 
  cloud albedo decreases with decreasing droplet size for the optically thinner 
  clouds over the oceans. While this does not invalidate the aerosol indirect 
  effect at all, it underlines the limitations in using satellite observed changes 
  in droplet size to compute the aerosol indirect forcing. Therefore it seems 
  difficult at present to use satellite observations to estimate the first aerosol 
  indirect forcing unless some changes in cloud albedo could be tied to changes 
  in aerosol concentrations under the assumption of constant liquid water content. 
  Satellite observations do play, however, a key role for evaluating models of 
  the indirect aerosol radiative effect (Ghan et al., 2001b).</p>
