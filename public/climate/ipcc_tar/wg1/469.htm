<h2>Appendix 12.2: Three Approaches to Optimal Detection </h2>
<p>Optimal detection studies come in several variants depending upon how the time 
  evolution of signal amplitude and structure is treated. </p>
<p><i>Fixed pattern </i>studies (Hegerl et al., 1996, 1997, 2000a; Berliner et 
  al., 2000; Schnur, 2001) assume that the spatial structure of the signals does 
  not change during the epoch covered by the instrumental record. This type of 
  study searches for evidence that the amplitudes of fixed anthropogenic signals 
  are increasing with time. The observed field <b>y</b>=<b>y</b>(<i>t</i>) that 
  appears on the left hand side of equation (<a href="468.htm#equ121">A12.1.1</a>) 
  is typically a field of 30 to 50-year moving window trends computed from annual 
  mean observations. The regression equation (<a href="468.htm#equ121">A12.1.1</a>) 
  is solved repeatedly with a fixed signal matrix <b>G</b> as the moving 30 to 
  50-year window is stepped through the available record. </p>
<p>Studies with <i>time-varying patterns</i> allow the shape of the signals, as 
  well as their amplitudes, to evolve with time. Such studies come in two flavours. 
</p>
<p>The <i>space-time</i> approach uses enlarged signal vectors that consist of 
  a sequence of spatial patterns representing the evolution of the signal through 
  a short epoch. For example, Tett et al. (1999) use signal vectors composed of 
  five spatial patterns representing a sequence of decadal means. The enlarged 
  signal matrix <b>G</b>=<b>G</b>(<i>t</i>) evolves with time as the 5-decade 
  window is moved one decade at a time. The observations are defined similarly 
  as extended vectors containing a sequence of observed decadal mean temperature 
  patterns. As with the fixed pattern approach, a separate model is fitted for 
  each 5-decade window so that the evolution of the signal amplitudes can be studied.</p>
<p>The <i>space-frequency</i> approach (North et al., 1995) uses annual mean signal 
  patterns that evolve throughout the analysis period. A Fourier transform is 
  used to map the temporal variation of each signal into the frequency domain. 
  Only the low-frequency Fourier coefficients representing decadal-scale variability 
  are retained and gathered into a signal vector. The observations are similarly 
  transformed. The selection of time-scales that is effected by retaining only 
  certain Fourier coefficients is a form of dimension reduction (see Dimension 
  Reduction, <a href="471.htm">Appendix 12.4</a>) in the time domain. This is 
  coupled with spatial dimension reduction that must also be performed. The result 
  approximates the dimension reduction that is obtained by projecting observations 
  in space and time on low order space-time EOFs (North et al., 1995). A further 
  variation on this theme is obtained by increasing the time resolution of the 
  signals and the data by using monthly rather than annual means. Climate statistics, 
  including means, variances and covariances, have annual cycles at this time 
  resolution, and thus dimension reduction must be performed with cyclo-stationary 
  space-time EOFs (Kim and Wu, 2000).</p>
<p>Given the same amount of data to estimate covariance matrices, the space-time 
  and space-frequency approaches will sacrifice spatial resolution for temporal 
  resolution.</p>
