<h3><a name="243"></a>2.4.3 How Fast did Climate Change during the Glacial Period?</h3>
<p>The most extreme manifestation of climate change in the geological record is 
  the transition from full glacial to full inter-glacial conditions. During the 
  most recent glacial cycle, peak glacial conditions prevailed from about 25 to 
  18 ky BP. Temperatures close to those of today were restored by approximately 
  10 ky BP. However, warming was not continuous. The deglaciation was accomplished 
  in two main stages, with a return to colder conditions (Younger Dryas/Antarctic 
  Cold Reversal) or, at the least, a pause in the deglaciation.</p>
<p>The central Greenland ice core record (GRIP and GISP2) 
  has a near annual resolution across the entire glacial to Holocene transition, 
  and reveals episodes of very rapid change. The return to the cold conditions 
  of the Younger Dryas from the incipient inter-glacial warming 13,000 years ago 
  took place within a few decades or less (Alley et al., 1993). The warming phase, 
  that took place about 11,500 years ago, at the end of the Younger Dryas was 
  also very abrupt and central Greenland temperatures increased by 7&deg;C or 
  more in a few decades (Johnsen et al., 1992; Grootes et al., 1993; Severinghaus 
  et al., 1998). Most of the changes in wind-blown materials and some other climate 
  indicators were accomplished in a few years (Alley et al., 1993; Taylor et al., 
  1993; Hammer et al., 1997). Broad regions of the Earth experienced almost synchronous 
  changes over periods of 0 to 30 years (Severinghaus et al., 1998), and changes 
  were very abrupt in at least some regions (Bard et al., 1987), e.g. requiring 
  as little as 10 years off Venezuela (Hughen et al., 1996). Fluctuations in ice 
  conductivity indicate that atmospheric circulation was reorganised extremely 
  rapidly (Taylor et al., 1993). A similar, correlated sequence of abrupt deglacial 
  events also occurred in the tropical and temperate North Atlantic (Bard et al., 
  1987; Hughen et al., 1996) and in Western Europe (von Grafenstein et al., 1999). 
</p>
<p>A Younger-Dryas type event is also recorded in a Bolivian ice core (Thompson 
  et al., 1998; Sajama, South America in <a href="073.htm#fig224">Figure 2.24</a>) 
  and in a major advance of a mountain glacier in the Southern Alps of New Zealand 
  (Denton and Hendy, 1994). However there is recent evidence against a significant 
  Younger Dryas cooling here (Singer et al., 1998) and at other sites of the Southern 
  Hemisphere (reviewed by Alley and Clarke, 1999). Instead, the Antarctic (and 
  Southern Ocean) climate was characterised by a less pronounced cooling (the 
  Antarctic Cold Reversal: Jouzel et al., 1987) which preceded the Younger Dryas 
  by more than 1 ky (Jouzel et al., 1995; Sowers and Bender, 1995; Blunier et 
  al., 1997). Curiously, one coastal site in Antarctica, Taylor Dome (Steig et 
  al., 1998) exhibited cooling in phase with the North Atlantic. Recent series 
  obtained at Law Dome, another coastal site of East Antarctica, show instead 
  a cold reversal preceding the Younger Dryas as in other Antarctic records. This 
  suggests that the Taylor Dome record is of limited geographical significance 
  but it also suggests that there is more to be discovered about this cooling 
  event in the Southern </p>
<p><i>Hemisphere.</i><br>
  The inception of deglacial warming about 14.5 ky BP was also very rapid, leading 
  to the B&ouml;lling-Aller&ouml;d warm period in less than twenty years (Severinghaus 
  and Brook, 1999). Almost synchronously, major vegetation changes occurred in 
  Europe and North America with a rise in African lake levels (Gasse and van Campo, 
  1994). There was also a pronounced warming of the North Atlantic and North Pacific 
  (Ko&ccedil; and Janssen, 1994; Sarnthein et al., 1994; Kotilainen and Shackleton, 
  1995; Thunnell and Mortyn, 1995; Wansaard, 1996; Watts et al., 1996; Webb et 
  al., 1998).</p>
<p>The rate of temperature change during the recovery phase from the last glacial 
  maximum provides a benchmark against which to assess warming rates in the late 
  20th century. Available data indicate an average warming rate of about 2&deg;C/millennium 
  between about 20 and 10 ky BP in Greenland, with lower rates for other regions. 
  Speleothem data from New Zealand, and positions of mountain glacier moraine 
  termini suggest warming rates of 2&deg;C/millennium from 15 to 13 ky BP (Salinger 
  and McGlone, 1989). Speleothem data for South Africa suggest a warming rate 
  of 1.5&deg;C/millennium (Partridge, 1997) over the same time period. On the 
  other hand, very rapid warming at the start of the B&ouml;lling-Aller&ouml;d 
  period, or at the end of the Younger Dryas may have occurred at rates as large 
  as 10&deg;C/50 years for a significant part of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Oxygen isotope measurements in Greenland ice cores demonstrate that a series 
  of rapid warm and cold oscillations called Dansgaard-Oeschger events punctuated 
  the last glaciation (<a href="072.htm#fig223">Figure 2.23,</a> see North Atlantic 
  SST panel, and Dansgaard et al., 1993). Associated temperature changes may be 
  as high as 16&deg;C (Lang et al., 1999). These oscillations are correlated with 
  SST variations in several North Atlantic deep-sea cores (Bond et al., 1993). 
  There was clearly a close relation between these ice core temperature cycles 
  and another prominent feature of North Atlantic deep-sea core records, the Heinrich 
  events. Heinrich events occurred every 7,000 to 10,000 years during times of 
  sea surface cooling in the form of brief, exceptionally large, discharges of 
  icebergs from the Laurentide and European ice sheets which left conspicuous 
  layers of detrital rocks in deep-sea sediments. Accompanying the Heinrich events 
  were large decreases in the oxygen isotope ratio of planktonic foraminifera, 
  providing evidence of lowered surface salinity probably caused by melting of 
  drifting ice (Bond et al., 1993). Heinrich events appear at the end of a series 
  of saw-toothed shaped, near millennial temperature cycles. Each set of millennial 
  cycles is known as a Bond cycle. Each cycle was characterised by a succession 
  of progressively cooler relatively warm periods (interstadials) during the Ice 
  Age period. Each cooling trend ended with a very rapid, high amplitude, warming 
  and a massive discharge of icebergs. The impact of these Heinrich events on 
  the climate system extended far beyond the northern North Atlantic. At the time 
  of major iceberg discharges, strong vegetation changes have been detected in 
  Florida (Grimm et al., 1993; Watts et al., 1996), oceanic changes occurred in 
  the Santa Barbara Basin off California (Behl and Kennet, 1996) and changes in 
  loess grain-size, associated with atmospheric circulation changes, have been 
  detected in China (Porter and An, 1995; Ding et al., 1998). </p>
<p><a name="fig225ii"></a>Deep-sea cores also show the presence of ice rafting 
  cycles in the intervals between Heinrich events (Bond and Lotti, 1995). Their 
  duration varies between 2,000 and 3,000 years and they closely coincide with 
  the Dansgaard-Oeschger events of the last glaciation. A study of the ice-rafted 
  material suggests that, coincident with the Dansgaard-Oeschger cooling, ice 
  within the Icelandic ice cap and within or near the Gulf of Saint Lawrence underwent 
  nearly synchronous increases in rates of calving. The Heinrich events reflect 
  a slower rhythm of iceberg discharges, probably from the Hudson Strait. </p>
<p>Air temperature, SST and salinity variations in the North Atlantic are associated 
  with major changes in the thermohaline circulation. A core from the margin of 
  the Faeroe-Shetland channel covering the last glacial period reveals numerous 
  oscillations in benthic and planktonic foraminifera, oxygen isotopes and ice-rafted 
  detritus (Rasmussen et al., 1996a). These oscillations correlate with the Dansgaard-Oeschger 
  cycles, showing a close relationship between the deep ocean circulation and 
  the abrupt climatic changes of the last glaciation. Warm episodes were associated 
  with higher SST and the presence of oceanic convection in the Norwegian Greenland 
  Sea. Cold episodes were associated with low SST and salinity and no convection 
  in the Norwegian Greenland Sea (Rasmussen et al., 1996b). Cores from the mid-latitudes 
  of the North Atlantic show that the iceberg discharges in Heinrich events resulted 
  in both low salinity and a reduced thermohaline circulation (Cortijo et al., 
  1997; Vidal et al., 1997).</p>
<p>These rapid climatic events of the last glacial period, best documented in 
  Greenland and the North Atlantic, have smoothed counterparts in Antarctica (Bender 
  et al., 1994; Jouzel et al., 1994). A peak in the concentration of the isotope 
  beryllium-10 in ice cores (Yiou et al., 1997a), changes in the concentration 
  of atmospheric methane (Blunier et al., 1998) and in the isotopic content of 
  oxygen in ice cores (Bender et al., 1999) indicate links between the Northern 
  and Southern Hemisphere climates over this period. Large Greenland warming events 
  around 36 and 45 ky BP lag their Antarctic counterparts by more than 1,000 years. 
  This argues against coupling between northern and southern polar regions via 
  the atmosphere but favours a connection via the ocean (Blunier et al., 1998).</p>
<p>New evidence suggests that the North Atlantic has three modes of operation. 
  These are: deep-water sinking in the GIN (Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian) Seas 
  and the Labrador Sea, deep-water sinking in the North Atlantic or in the Labrador 
  Sea but not the GIN Seas (Duplessy et al., 1991; Labeyrie et al., 1992) in the 
  cold phase of Dansgaard-Oeschger events and at glacial maximum, and little deep-water 
  sinking in the GIN or Labrador Seas (Heinrich events) (Sarnthein et al., 1994; 
  Vidal et al., 1997, 1998; Alley and Clark, 1999; Stocker, 2000). The first type 
  corresponds to modern, warm conditions. Shut-down of convection in the GIN Seas 
  has a strong effect on the high latitude Atlantic atmosphere and on areas that 
  respond to it such as the monsoon regions of north Africa (Street-Perrott and 
  Perrott, 1990). However, cross-equatorial Atlantic ocean surface transport that 
  supplies the water for the formation of the Labrador Sea deep-water continues 
  to remove heat from the South Atlantic under these conditions. The additional 
  "Heinrich shut-down" of the North Atlantic and Labrador Sea deep-water 
  formation allows this heat to remain in the South Atlantic (Crowley, 1992), 
  and may increase deep-water formation either south of the area affected by melt-water 
  injection (Vidal et al., 1997, 1998) or in the Southern Ocean (Broecker, 1998). 
  This reorganisation could cause warming of regions of the South Atlantic and 
  downwind of it (Charles et al., 1996; Blunier et al., 1998) through a seesaw 
  relationship with the North Atlantic. However, the behaviour of Taylor Dome 
  in the Antarctic and several other southern sites (see above) which exhibit 
  cooling in phase with the North Atlantic argue for an additional atmospheric 
  link to some southern regions.</p>
