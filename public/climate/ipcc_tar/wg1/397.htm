<h4>10.6.2.3 Weather typing</h4>
<p>This synoptic downscaling approach relates "weather classes" to local 
  and regional climate variations. The weather classes may be defined synoptically 
  or fitted specifically for downscaling purposes by constructing indices of airflow 
  (Conway et al., 1996). The frequency distributions of local or regional climate 
  are then derived by weighting the local climate states with the relative frequencies 
  of the weather classes. Climate change is then estimated by determining the 
  change of the frequency of weather classes. However, typing procedures contain 
  a potentially critical weakness in assuming that the characteristics of the 
  weather classes do not change.</p>
<p>In many cases, the local and regional climate states are derived by sampling 
  the observational record. For example, Wanner et al. (1997) and Widmann and 
  Sch&auml;r (1997) used changing global to continental scale synoptic structures 
  to understand and reconstruct Alpine climate variations. The technique was applied 
  similarly for New Zealand (Kidson and Watterson, 1995) and to a study of changing 
  air pollution mechanisms (Jones and Davies, 2000). </p>
<p>An extreme form of weather typing is the analogue method (Zorita et al., 1995). 
  A similar concept, although mathematically more demanding, is Classification 
  And Tree Analysis (CART) which uses a randomised design for picking regional 
  distributions (Hughes et al., 1993; Lettenmaier, 1995). Both analogue and CART 
  approaches returnapproximately the right level of variance and correct spatial 
  correlation structures. </p>
<p>Weather typing is also used in statistical-dynamical downscaling (SDD), a hybrid 
  approach with dynamical elements (Frey-Buness et al., 1995 and see references 
  in <a href="406.htm">Appendix 10.4</a>). GCM results of a multi-year climate 
  period are disaggregated into non-overlapping multi-day episodes of quasi-stationary 
  large-scale flow patterns. Similar episodes are then grouped in classes of different 
  weather types, and, members of these classes are simulated with an RCM. The 
  RCM results are statistically evaluated, and the frequency of occurrence of 
  the respective classes determines their statistical weight. An advantage of 
  the SDD technique over other empirical downscaling techniques is that it specifies 
  a complete three-dimensional climate state. The advantage over continuous RCM 
  simulations is the reduction in computing time, as demonstrated in <a href="#fig1017">Figure 
  10.17</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="1063"></a>10.6.3 Issues in Statistical Downscaling </h3>
<h4><a name="10631"></a>10.6.3.1 Temporal variance</h4>
<p>Transfer function approaches and some weather typing methods suffer from an 
  under prediction of temporal variability, as this is related only in part to 
  the large-scale climate variations (see Katz and Parlange, 1996). Two approaches 
  have been used to restore the level of variability: inflation and randomisation. 
  In the inflation approach the variation is increased by the multiplication of 
  a suitable factor (Karl et al., 1990). A more sophisticated version is "expanded 
  downscaling", a variant of Canonical Correlation Analysis that ensures 
  the right level of variability (B&uuml;rger, 1996; Huth, 1999; Dehn et al., 
  2000). In the randomisation approachs, the unrepresented variability is added 
  as noise, possibly conditioned on synoptic state (Buma and Dehn, 1998; Dehn 
  and Buma 1999; Hewitson, 1999; von Storch, 1999b).</p>
<p>Often weather generators have difficulty in representing low frequency variance, 
  and conditioning the generator parameters on the large-scale state may alleviate 
  this problem (see Katz and Parlange, 1996; Wilby, 1998; Charles et al., 1999a). 
  For example, Katz and Parlange (1993, 1996) modelled daily time-series of precipitation 
  as a chain-dependent process, conditioned on a discrete circulation index. The 
  results demonstrated that the mean and standard deviation of intensity and the 
  probability of precipitation varied significantly with the circulation, and 
  reproduced the precipitation variance statistics of the observations better 
  than the unconditioned model. The method describes the mean precipitation as 
  a linear function of the circulation state, and the standard deviation as a 
  non-linear function (<a href="#fig1017">Figure 10.18</a>).</p>
