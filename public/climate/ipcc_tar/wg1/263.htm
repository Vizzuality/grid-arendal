<h2>7.1 Introduction<br>
</h2>
<p>The key problem to be addressed is the response of the climate system to changes 
  in forcing. In many cases there is a fairly direct and linear response and many 
  of the simulated changes fall into that class (<a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>). 
  These concern the large-scale general circulations of the atmosphere and ocean, 
  and they are in principle represented in current comprehensive coupled climate 
  models. Such possible large-scale dynamical feedbacks are also influenced by 
  small-scale processes within the climate system. The various feedbacks in the 
  climate system may amplify (positive feedbacks), or diminish (negative feedbacks) 
  the original response. We often approximate the response of a particular variable 
  to a small forcing by a scaling number. A prominent example of such a quantification 
  is the equilibrium global mean temperature increase per Wm<sup>-2</sup> change 
  in the global mean atmospheric radiative forcing (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>, <a href="344.htm#921">Section 9.2.1</a>). <br>
</p>
<p> While many aspects of the response of the climate system to greenhouse gas 
  forcing appear to be linear, regime or mode transitions cannot be quantified 
  by a simple number because responses do not scale with the amplitude of the 
  forcing: small perturbations can induce large changes in certain variables of 
  the climate system. This implies the existence of thresholds in the climate 
  system which can be crossed for a sufficiently large perturbation. While such 
  behaviour has long been known and studied in the context of simple models of 
  the climate system, such thresholds are now also found in the comprehensive 
  coupled climate models currently available. Within this framework, the possibility 
  for irreversible changes in the climate system exists. This insight, backed 
  by the palaeo-climatic record (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="072.htm">Section 
  2.4</a>), is a new challenge for global change science because now thresholds 
  have to be identified and their values need to be estimated using the entire 
  hierarchy of climate models.<br>
</p>
<p> To estimate the response properly, we must represent faithfully the physical 
  processes in models. Not only must the whole system model perform reasonably 
  well in comparison with observation (both spatial and temporal), but so too 
  must the component models and the processes that are involved in the models. 
  It is possible to tune a model so that some variable appears consistent with 
  that observed, but we must also ask whether it comes out that way for the right 
  reason and with the right variability. By examining how well individual processes 
  are known and can be modelled, we can comment on the capabilities and usefulness 
  of the models, and whether they are likely to be able to properly represent 
  possible non-linear responses of the climate system.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="711"></a>7.1.1 Issues of Continuing Interest<br>
</h3>
<p>Examples of some processes in the climate system and its components that have 
  been dealt with in the Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) 
  and still are important topics of progress:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>The hydrological cycle.</i> Progress has been made in all aspects of 
    the hydrological cycle in the atmosphere, involving evaporation, atmospheric 
    moisture, clouds, convection, and precipitation. Because many facets of these 
    phenomena are sub-grid scale, they must be parametrized. While models reasonably 
    simulate gross aspects of the observed behaviour on several time-scales, it 
    is easy to point out shortcomings, although it is unclear as to how much these 
    affect the sensitivity of simulated climate to changes in climate forcing.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Water vapour feedback.</i> An increase in the temperature of the atmosphere 
    increases its water-holding capacity; however, since most of the atmosphere 
    is undersaturated, this does not automatically mean that water vapour, itself, 
    must increase. Within the boundary layer (roughly the lowest 1 to 2 km of 
    the atmosphere), relative humidity tends to remain fixed, and water vapour 
    does increase with increasing temperature. In the free troposphere above the 
    boundary layer, where the water vapour greenhouse effect is most important, 
    the behaviour of water vapour cannot be inferred from simple thermodynamic 
    arguments. Free tropospheric water vapour is governed by a variety of dynamical 
    and microphysical influences which are represented with varying degrees of 
    fidelity in general circulation models. Since water vapour is a powerful greenhouse 
    gas, increasing water vapour in the free troposphere would lead to a further 
    enhancement of the greenhouse effect and act as a positive feedback; within 
    current models, this is the most important reason for large responses to increased 
    anthropogenic greenhouse gases.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Cloud radiation feedback.</i> Clouds can both absorb and reflect solar 
    radiation (thereby cooling the surface) and absorb and emit long-wave radiation 
    (thereby warming the surface). The compensation between those effects depends 
    on cloud height, thickness and cloud radiative properties. The radiative properties 
    of clouds depend on the evolution of atmospheric water vapour, water drops, 
    ice particles and atmospheric aerosols. These cloud processes are most important 
    for determining radiative, and hence temperature, changes in models. Although 
    their representation is greatly improved in models, the added complexity may 
    explain why considerable uncertainty remains; this represents a significant 
    source of potential error in climate simulations. The range in estimated climate 
    sensitivity of 1.5 to 4.5&deg;C for a CO<sub>2</sub> doubling is largely dictated by 
    the interaction of model water vapour feedbacks with the variations in cloud 
    behaviour among existing models. </li>
  <li><i>Sub-grid scale processes in ocean models.</i> Although improved parametrizations 
    in coarse resolution models are available to represent mixing processes, they 
    do not, in their present form, induce sufficient variability on the broad 
    range of time-scales exhibited by eddy-resolving ocean models. Thus present 
    generations of coarse resolution ocean models may not be able to decide questions 
    about those types of natural variability that are associated with sub-grid 
    scale processes, and increased resolution is highly desirable.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
