<h3><a name="234"></a>2.3.4 Volcanic and Solar Effects in the Recent Record </h3>
<p>Recent studies comparing reconstructions of surface temperature and natural 
  (solar and volcanic) radiative forcing (e.g., Lean et al., 1995; Crowley and 
  Kim, 1996, 1999; Overpeck et al., 1997; Mann et al., 1998; Damon and Peristykh, 
  1999; Free and Robock, 1999; Waple et al., 2001) suggest that a combination 
  of solar and volcanic influences have affected large-scale temperature in past 
  centuries. The primary features of the Northern Hemisphere mean annual temperature 
  histories of Mann et al. (1999a) and Crowley and Lowery (2000) from AD 1000 
  to 1900 have been largely reproduced based on experiments using an Energy Balance 
  Model forced by estimates of these natural radiative forcings (Crowley, 2000; 
  Mann, 2000) making the argument that the "Little Ice Age" and "Medieval 
  Warm Period", at the hemispheric mean scale, are consistent with estimates 
  of naturally-forced climate variability. Several studies indicate that the combined 
  effect of these influences has contributed a small component to the warming 
  of the 20th century. Most of these studies isolate greenhouse radiative forcing 
  as being dominant during late 20th century warming (see Crowley, 2000). This 
  argues against a close empirical relationship between certain sun-climate parameters 
  and large-scale temperature that has been claimed for the 20th century (Hoyt 
  and Schatten, 1997). The reader is referred to <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a> 
  for a detailed discussion of these radiative forcings, and to <a href="439.htm">Chapter 
  12</a> for comparisons of observed and model simulations of recent climate change.</p>
<h3><a name="235"></a>2.3.5 Summary</h3>
<p>Since the SAR there have been considerable advances in our knowledge of temperature 
  change over the last millennium. It is likely that temperatures were relatively 
  warm in the Northern Hemisphere as a whole during the earlier centuries of the 
  millennium, but it is much less likely that a globally-synchronous, well defined 
  interval of "Medieval warmth" existed, comparable to the near global 
  warmth of the late 20th century. Marked warmth seems to have been confined to 
  Europe and regions neighbouring the North Atlantic. Relatively colder hemispheric 
  or global-scale conditions did appear to set in after about AD 1400 and persist 
  through the 19th century, but peak coldness is observed during substantially 
  different epochs in different regions. By contrast, the warming of the 20th 
  century has had a much more convincing global signature (see <a href="057.htm#fig29">Figure 
  2.9</a>). This is consistent with the palaeoclimate evidence that the rate and 
  magnitude of global or hemispheric surface 20th century warming is likely to 
  have been the largest of the millennium, with the 1990s and 1998 likely to have 
  been the warmest decade and year, respectively, in the Northern Hemisphere. 
  Independent estimates of hemispheric and global ground temperature trends over 
  the past five centuries from sub-surface information contained in borehole data 
  confirm the conclusion that late 20th century warmth is anomalous in a long-term 
  context. Decreasing temporal resolution back in time of these estimates and 
  potential complications in inferring surface air temperature trends from sub-surface 
  ground temperature measurements precludes, however, a meaningful direct comparison 
  of the borehole estimates with high-resolution temperature estimates based on 
  other proxy climate data. Because less data are available, less is known about 
  annual averages prior to 1,000 years before the present and for conditions prevailing 
  in most of the Southern Hemisphere prior to 1861.</p>
