<h3>4.6 Overall Impact of Global Atmospheric Chemistry Change</h3>
<p>The projected growth in emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants 
  in the IPCC SRES scenarios for the 21st century is expected to increase the 
  atmospheric burden of non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases substantially and 
  contribute a sizable fraction to the overall increase in radiative forcing of 
  the climate. These changes in atmospheric composition may, however, degrade 
  the global environment in ways beyond climate change.</p>
<p>The impact of metropolitan pollution, specifically O<sub>3</sub> and CO, on 
  the background air of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans has been highlighted by 
  many studies over the past decade. These have ranged from observations of anthropogenic 
  pollution reaching across the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Parrish et al., 1993; 
  Jaffe et al., 1999) to analyses of rapidly increasing emissions of pollutants 
  (NO<sub>x</sub>, CO, VOC) in, for example, East Asia (Kato and Akimoto 1992; 
  Elliott et al., 1997). CTM studies have tried to quantify some of these projections 
  for the near term: Berntsen et al. (1999) predict notable increases in CO and 
  O<sub>3</sub> coming into the north-west USA from a doubling of current Asian 
  emissions; Jacob et al. (1999) calculate that monthly mean O<sub>3</sub> abundances 
  over the USA will increase by 1 to 6 ppb from a tripling of these emissions 
  between 1985 and 2010; and Collins et al. (2000) project a 3 ppb increase from 
  1990 to 2015 in monthly mean O<sub>3</sub> over north-west Europe due to rising 
  North American emissions. The impact of metropolitan pollution will expand over 
  the coming decades as urban areas grow and use of resources intensifies.</p>
<p>What is new in this IPCC assessment is the extension of these projections to 
  the year 2100, whereupon the cumulative impact of all Northern Hemisphere emissions, 
  not just those immediately upwind, may for some scenarios double O<sub>3</sub> 
  abundances over the northern mid-latitudes. Surface O<sub>3</sub> abundances 
  during July over the industrialised continents of the Northern Hemisphere are 
  about 40 ppb with 2000 emissions; and under SRES scenarios A2 and A1FI they 
  would reach 45 to 50 ppb with 2030 emissions, 60 ppb with 2060 emissions, and 
  &gt;70 ppb with 2100 emissions. Since regional ozone episodes start with these 
  background levels and build upon them with local smog production, it may be 
  impossible under these circumstances to achieve a clean-air standard of &lt;80 
  ppb over most populated regions. This problem reaches across continental boundaries 
  and couples emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> on a hemispheric scale. In the 21st 
  century a global perspective will be needed to meet regional air quality objectives. 
  The impact of this threatened degradation of air quality upon societal behaviour 
  and policy decisions will possibly change the balance of future emissions impacting 
  climate change (e.g., more fuel burn (CO<sub>2</sub>) to achieve lower NO<sub>x</sub> 
  as in aviation; Penner et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Under some emission scenarios, the large increases in tropo-spheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  combined with the decreases in OH may alter the oxidation rate and the degradation 
  paths for hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances. The damage caused by 
  higher O<sub>3</sub> levels to both crops and natural systems needs to be assessed, 
  and societal responses to this threat would likely change the emissions scenarios 
  evaluated here (e.g., the current SRES scenarios anticipate the societal demand 
  to control urban aerosols and acid rain by substantially cutting sulphur emissions).</p>
<p>Coupling between atmospheric chemistry, the biosphere, and the climate are 
  not at the stage that these feedbacks can be included in this assessment. There 
  are indications, however, that the evolution of natural emissions and physical 
  climate projected over the next century will change the baseline atmospheric 
  chemistry and lead to altered biosphere-atmosphere exchanges and continued atmospheric 
  change independent of anthropogenic emissions.</p>
