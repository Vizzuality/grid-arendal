<h2><a name="26"></a>2.6 Are the Atmospheric/Oceanic Circulations Changing? </h2>
<h3><a name="261"></a>2.6.1 Background</h3>
<p>Changes or fluctuations in atmospheric and oceanic circulation 
  are important elements of climate. Such circulation changes are the main cause 
  of variations in climate elements on a regional scale, sometimes mediated by 
  parallel changes in the land surface (IPCC, 1990, 1996). ENSO and NAO are such 
  examples. On decadal time-scales, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and 
  the related Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) may account for approximately 
  half the global mean variation in surface temperatures. They are also prominently 
  linked to regional variations in temperature and precipitation (Higgins et al., 
  2000). This section documents regional changes and slow fluctuations in atmospheric 
  circulation over past decades, and demonstrates that these are consistent with 
  large-scale changes in other variables, especially temperature and precipitation. 
  Note that there is much evidence that many of the atmospheric circulation changes 
  we observe, particularly in the extra-tropics, are the net result of irregular 
  fluctuations between preferred states of the atmosphere (Palmer, 1993, 1999) 
  that last for much shorter times. Thus changes in circulation on decadal time-scales 
  involve changes in the frequency of such states. <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a> 
  discusses this in more detail. The focus of this section is on long-term variation 
  and change, rather than on shorter-term variability.</p>
<h3><a name="262"></a>2.6.2 El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation and Tropical/Extra-tropical 
  Interaction</h3>
<p>ENSO is the primary global mode of climate variability in the 2 to 7 year time 
  band. El Ni&ntilde;o is defined by SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific 
  while the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is a measure of the atmospheric circulation 
  response in the Pacific-Indian Ocean region. This sub-section assesses the variability 
  of ENSO over the past few centuries.</p>

      with the NINO 3 series. An instrumental NINO 3 index from 1871 to 2000 is

<p>Multiproxy-based reconstructions of the behaviour of ENSO have recently been 
  attempted for the past few centuries, including a boreal winter season SOI reconstruction 
  based on highly ENSO-sensitive tree-ring indicators (Stahle et al., 1998). A 
  multiproxy-based reconstruction of the boreal cold-season (Oct-Mar) NINO 3 (SST 
  anomalies in the tropical Pacific from 5&deg;N to 5&deg;S, 150&deg;W to 90&deg;W) 
  index (Mann et al., 2000b) has also been made. <a href="#fig228">Figure 
  2.28</a> compares the behaviour of these two series with recent ENSO behaviour. 
  The SOI reconstruction has been rescaled to have the sign and variance of the 
  NINO 3 reconstruction; the two reconstructions, based on independent methods 
  and partially independent data, have a linear correlation (r=0.64) during the 
  pre-calibration interval. While the estimated uncertainties in these reconstructed 
  series are substantial, they suggest that the very large 1982/83 and 1997/98 
  warm events might be outside the range of variability of the past few centuries. 
  However, the reconstructions tend to underestimate the amplitude of ENSO events, 
  as is clearly evident for the large 1877/78 event. Only a richer network of 
  ENSO-sensitive proxy indicators can improve this situation, such as the new 
  long tropical coral series becoming available (see Dunbar and Cole, 1999).</p>
<p>Instrumental records have been examined to search for possible changes in ENSO 
  over the past 120 years. Three new reconstructions of SST in the eastern Equatorial 
  Pacific (<a href="#fig229">Figure 2.29</a>) that use optimum interpolation 
  methods exhibit strong similarities. The dominant 2 to 6 year time-scale in 
  ENSO is apparent. Both the activity and periodicity of ENSO have varied considerably 
  since 1871 with considerable irregularity in time. There was an apparent "shift" 
  in the temperature of the tropical Pacific around 1976 to warmer conditions, 
  discussed in the SAR, which appeared to continue until at least 1998. During 
  this period ENSO events were more frequent, intense or persistent. It is unclear 
  whether this warm state continues, with the persistance of the long La Ni&ntilde;a 
  from late 1998 until early 2001. ENSO has been related to variations of precipitation 
  and temperature over much of the tropics and sub-tropics, and some mid-latitude 
  areas.</p>
<p>A number of recent studies have found changes in the interannual variability 
  of ENSO over the last century, related in part to an observed reduction in ENSO 
  variability between about 1920 and 1960. Various studies (Wang and Wang, 1996; 
  Torrence and Compo, 1998; Torrence and Webster, 1998; Kestin et al., 1999) show 
  more robust signals in the quasi-biennial and &#145;classical' 3 to 4 year 
  ENSO bands (3.4 and 7 years) during the first and last 40 to 50 years of the 
  instrumental record. A period of very weak signal strength (with a near 5-year 
  periodicity) occurs in much of the intervening epoch. </p>
<p>The 1990s have received considerable attention, as the recent behaviour of 
  ENSO seems unusual relative to that of previous decades. A protracted period 
  of low SOI from 1990 to 1995, during which several weak to moderate El Ni&ntilde;o 
  events occurred with no intervening La Ni&ntilde;a events (Goddard and Graham, 
  1997) was found by some studies (e.g., Trenberth and Hoar, 1996) to be statistically 
  very rare. Whether global warming is influencing El Ni&ntilde;o, especially 
  given the remarkable El Ni&ntilde;o of 1997/98, is a key question (Trenberth, 
  1998b), especially as El Ni&ntilde;o affects global temperature itself (<a href="052.htm#22">Section 
  2.2</a> and <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>). </p>
