<h4>9.3.3.1 Implications for temperature of stabilisation of greenhouse gases</h4>

<p><a name="fig916"></a>The objective of Article 2 of the United Nations Framework 
  Convention on Climate Change (United Nations, 1992) is "to achieve stabilisation 
  of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent 
  dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system." This section 
  gives an example of the possible effect on future temperature change of the 
  stabilisation of greenhouse gases at different levels using carbon dioxide stabilisation 
  as a specific example. The carbon dioxide concentration stabilisation profiles 
  developed by Wigley et al. (1996) (see also Wigley, 2000) commonly referred 
  to as the WRE profiles, are used. These profiles indirectly incorporate economic 
  considerations. They are also in good agreement with observed carbon dioxide 
  concentrations up to 1999. Corresponding stabilisation profiles for the other 
  greenhouses gases have not yet been produced. To illustrate the effect on temperature 
  of earlier reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, results are also presented 
  for the original stabilisation profiles referred to as the S profiles (Enting 
  et al., 1994). The S profiles are, however, unrealistic because, for example, 
  they require emissions and concentration values during the 1990s below those 
  actually observed.</p>
<p>In order to define future radiative forcings fully, it is necessary to make 
  assumptions about how the emissions or concentrations of the other gases may 
  change in the future. In addition, it is necessary to have a base scenario against 
  which the effect of the different stabilisation pathways may be assessed. The 
  state of the science at present is such that it is only possible to give illustrative 
  examples of possible outcomes (Wigley et al., 1996; Schimel et al., 1997; Mitchell 
  et al., 2000).</p>
<p>To produce these examples, the SRES scenario A1B is used as the base scenario. 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for this scenario are close to the WRE CO<sub>2</sub> 
  profiles in terms of their implied past and near-future values, so our choice 
  satisfies the underlying WRE assumption that emissions should initially follow 
  a baseline trajectory. This is not the case for the S profiles, however, because 
  as pointed out above, present day CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations already exceed 
  the values assumed for the S profiles. Note that the baseline scenario (A1B) 
  is specified only out to 2100. For stabilisation cases, emissions of non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  gases are assumed to follow the A1B scenario out to 2100 and are thereafter 
  held constant at their year 2100 level. For scenario A1B, this assumption of 
  constant emissions from 2100 leads to stabilisation of the other gas concentrations 
  at values close to their 2100 values. For gases with long lifetimes (such as 
  N<sub>2</sub>O) it takes centuries to reach stabilisation. In all cases, however, 
  the net radiative forcing changes for the non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases are small 
  after 2100 and negligible after about 2200. Note that, in comparing the baseline 
  case with the various stabilisation cases, the only gas that changes is CO<sub>2</sub>. 
</p>
<p>The models used to calculate the other gas concentrations and to convert concentrations 
  and sulphur dioxide emissions to radiative forcing are the same as those used 
  in <a href="353.htm#933">Section 9.3.3</a>. The simple climate model used is 
  again that based on Wigley and Raper (1992) and Raper et al. (1996), tuned to 
  the different AOGCMs using the CMIP2 data set (see <a href="371.htm">Appendix 
  9.1</a>).</p>
<p>The temperature consequences of the five WRE stabilisation profiles used, based 
  on the assumptions described above and using the simple model ensemble (the 
  average results from tuning the simple model to several AOGCMs), are shown in 
  <a href="#fig916">Figure 9.16</a>. The temperature results for the S profiles 
  are also included for comparison. The simple climate model can be expected to 
  give results in good agreement to those that would be produced by the AOGCMs 
  up to 2100. Thereafter the agreement becomes increasingly less certain and this 
  increasing uncertainty is indicated on the graph by the graduated broken lines. 
  Indeed it has been shown in a comparison of results from the simple model and 
  HadCM2 that the simple model under-estimates the temperature change compared 
  to HadCM2 on longer time-scales (Raper et al., 2001a). This is at least in part 
  due to the fact that the HadCM2 effective climate sensitivity increases with 
  time (see <a href="355.htm#9341">Section 9.3.4.1</a>). The results in <a href="#fig916">Figure 
  9.16</a> are consistent with the assumption of time-constant climate sensitivities, 
  the average value being 2.8&deg;C.</p>

<p><a name="fig917"></a>Since sulphur dioxide emissions stabilise at 2100, the 
  forcing from sulphate aerosols is constant thereafter. CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations 
  stabilise before 2200, and the forcing change from N<sub>2</sub>O concentration 
  changes after 2200 is less than 0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. The continued increase 
  in temperature after the time of CO<sub>2</sub> stabilisation (<a href="#fig916">Figure 
  9.16</a>) is in part due to the later stabilisation of the other gases but is 
  primarily due to the inertia in the climate system which requires several centuries 
  to come into equilibrium with a particular forcing.</p>
<p>Temperature changes from 1990 to 2100 and from 1990 to 2350, for the simple 
  climate model tuned to seven AOGCMs, are shown in <a href="#fig917">Figure 9.17</a>. 
  These Figures give some indication of the range of uncertainty in the results 
  due to differences in AOGCM response. <a href="#fig917">Figure 9.17a</a> also 
  shows the temperature change for the baseline scenario, A1B. The percentage 
  reductions in temperature change relative to the baseline scenario that the 
  WRE profiles achieve by 2100 are given in <a href="#tab93">Table 9.3</a>. These 
  range from 4 to 6% for the WRE1000 profile to 39 to 41% for the WRE450 profile. 
  Note that these reductions are for stabilisation of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  alone.</p>
<p>Although only CO<sub>2</sub> stabilisation is explicitly considered here, it 
  is important to note that the other gases also eventually stabilise in these 
  illustrations. The potential for further reductions in warming, both up to 2100 
  and beyond, through non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases, depends on whether, in more comprehensive 
  scenarios (when such become available), their stabilisation levels are less 
  than the levels assumed here.</p>
<p>Only one AOGCM study has considered the regional effects of stabilising CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations (Mitchell et al., 2000). HadCM2, which has an effective climate 
  sensitivity in the middle of the IPCC range (<a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a>), 
  was run with the S550 ppm and S750 ppm stabilisation profiles ("S profiles"; 
  Enting et al., 1994; Schimel et al., 1997). Simulations with a simple climate 
  model (Schimel et al., 1997) indicate that the global mean temperature response 
  in these profiles is likely to differ by no more than about 0.2&deg;C from the 
  equivalent WRE profiles (Wigley et al., 1996; see <a href="#fig916">Figure 9.16</a>), 
  though the maximum rate of temperature change is likely to be lower with the 
  S profiles. Global mean changes in the AOGCM experiments are similar to those 
  in Schimel et al. (1994). Note that the AOGCM experiments consider stabilisation 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations only, and do not take into account changes 
  in other gases, effectively assuming that concentrations of other gases are 
  stabilised immediately. To allow for ongoing increases in other greenhouse gases, 
  one would have in practice to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> to even lower levels to 
  obtain the same level of climate change. For example, in the IS92a scenario, 
  other trace gases contribute 1.3 Wm<sup>-2</sup> to the radiative forcing by 
  2100. If the emissions of these gases were to continue to increase as in the 
  IS92a scenario, then CO<sub>2</sub> levels would have to be reduced by about 
  95 ppm to maintain the same level of climate change in these experiments.</p>
<p>Changes in temperature and precipitation averaged over five sub-continental 
  regions at 2100 were compared to those in a baseline scenario based on 1%/yr 
  increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from 1990. With both stabilisation 
  profiles, there were significant reductions in the regional temperature changes 
  but the significance of the regional precipitation changes depended on location 
  and season. The response of AOGCMs to idealised stabilisation profiles is discussed 
  in <a href="358.htm">Section 9.3.4.4</a>.</p>
