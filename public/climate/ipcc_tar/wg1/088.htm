<p>Changes in climate variability and extremes of weather 
  and climate events have received increased attention in the last few years. 
  Understanding changes in climate variability and climate extremes is made difficult 
  by interactions between the changes in the mean and variability (Meehl et al., 
  2000). Such interactions vary from variable to variable depending on their statistical 
  distribution. For example, the distribution of temperatures often resembles 
  a normal distribution where non-stationarity of the distribution implies changes 
  in the mean or variance. In such a distribution, an increase in the mean leads 
  to new record high temperatures (<a href="#fig232">Figure 2.32a</a>), 
  but a change in the mean does not imply any change in variability. For example, 
  in <a href="#fig232">Figure 2.32a</a>, the range between the hottest 
  and coldest temperatures does not change. An increase in variability without 
  a change in the mean implies an increase in the probability of both hot and 
  cold extremes as well as the absolute value of the extremes (<a href="#fig232">Figure 
  2.32b</a>). Increases in both the mean and the variability are also possible 
  <a href="#fig232">(Figure 2.32c</a>), which affects (in this example) 
  the probability of hot and cold extremes, with more frequent hot events with 
  more extreme high temperatures and fewer cold events. Other combinations of 
  changes in both mean and variability would lead to different results.</p>
<p>Consequently, even when changes in extremes can be documented, unless a specific 
  analysis has been completed, it is often uncertain whether the changes are caused 
  by a change in the mean, variance, or both. In addition, uncertainties in the 
  rate of change of the mean confound interpretation of changes in variance since 
  all variance statistics are dependent on a reference level, i.e., the mean.</p>
<p>For variables that are not well approximated by normal distributions, like 
  precipitation, the situation is even more complex, especially for dry climates. 
  For precipitation, for example, changes in the mean total precipitation can 
  be accompanied by other changes like the frequency of precipitation or the shape 
  of the distribution including its variability. All these changes can affect 
  the various aspects of precipitation extremes including the intensity of precipitation 
  (amount per unit time).</p>
  This section considers the changes in variability and extremes simultaneously 
  for two variables, temperature and precipitation. We include new analyses and 
  additional data compiled since the SAR which provide new insights. We also assess 
  new information related to changes in extreme weather and climate phenomena, 
  e.g., tropical cyclones, tornadoes, etc. In these analyses, the primary focus 
  is on assessing the stationarity (e.g., the null hypothesis of no change) of 
  these events, given numerous inhomogeneities in monitoring.<br>
