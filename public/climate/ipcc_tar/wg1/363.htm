<h4>9.3.5.4 Summary</h4>
<p>There are now a greater number of global coupled atmosphere-ocean models and 
  a number of them have been run for multi-century time-scales. This has substantially 
  improved the basis for estimating long time-scale natural unforced variability. 
  There are still severe limitations in the ability of such models to represent 
  the full complexity of observed variability and the conclusions drawn here about 
  changes in variability must be viewed in the light of these shortcomings (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>).<br>
  Some new studies have reinforced results reported in the SAR. These are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The future mean Pacific climate base state could more resemble an El Ni&ntilde;o-like 
    state (i.e., a slackened west to east SST gradient with associated eastward 
    shifts of precipitation). Whilst this is shown in several studies, it is not 
    true of all. </li>
  <li>Enhanced interannual variability of daily precipitation in the Asian summer 
    monsoon. The changes in monsoon strength depend on the details of the forcing 
    scenario and model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some new results have challenged the conclusions drawn in earlier reports, 
  such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Little change or a decrease in ENSO variability. More recently, increases 
    in ENSO variability have been found in some models where it has been attributed 
    to increases in the strength of the thermocline. Decadal and longer time-scale 
    variability complicates assessment of future changes in individual ENSO event 
    amplitude and frequency. Assessment of such possible changes remains quite 
    difficult. The changes in both the mean and variability of ENSO are still 
    model dependent. </li>
</ul>
<p>Finally there are areas where there is no clear indication of possible changes 
  or no consensus on model predictions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Although many models show an El Ni&ntilde;o-like change in the mean state 
    of tropical Pacific SSTs, the cause is uncertain. In some models it has been 
    related to changes in cloud forcing and/or changes in the evaporative damping 
    of the east-west SST gradient, but the result remains model-dependent. For 
    such an El Ni&ntilde;o-like climate change, future seasonal precipitation 
    extremes associated with a given ENSO would be more intense due to the warmer 
    mean base state. </li>
  <li>There is still a lack of consistency in the analysis techniques used for 
    studying circulation statistics (such as the AO, NAO and AAO) and it is likely 
    that this is part of the reason for the lack of consensus from the models 
    in predictions of changes in such events.</li>
  <li>The possibility that climate change may be expressed as a change in the 
    frequency or structure of naturally occuring modes of low-frequency variability 
    has been raised. If true, this implies that GCMs must be able to simulate 
    such regime transitions to accurately predict the response of the system to 
    climate forcing. This capability has not yet been widely tested in climate 
    models. A few studies have shown increasingly positive trends in the indices 
    of the NAO/AO or the AAO in simulations with increased greenhouse gases, although 
    this is not true in all models, and the magnitude and character of the changes 
    varies across models.</li>
</ul>
