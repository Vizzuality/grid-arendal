<h3>7.3.2 Convection</h3>
<p>Open ocean convection occurs every winter at high latitudes when buoyancy loss 
  at the sea surface causes the surface layer to become denser than the water 
  below, and results in highly variable mixing depth as a function of space and 
  time (see recent review by Marshall and Schott, 1999). Convection directly affects 
  the SST locally, and on larger scales indirectly through its effect on water 
  mass properties and circulation. The maximum depth of convection occurs at the 
  end of the cooling season, and depends on the balance between the cumulative 
  air-sea fluxes, including ice-melt and precipitation, and the oceanic advection 
  of buoyancy. During the summer, shallow warm surface mixed layers isolate the 
  newly formed deep water from the atmosphere and mean currents and mesoscale 
  eddies steadily transfer the newly formed deep water into the abyssal ocean.</p>
<p> Deep convective mixing is an essential ingredient of the THC, in particular 
  in the North Atlantic, and is thus important for climate problems. It constitutes 
  a very efficient vertical transfer process, and only a few small regions are 
  needed to offset the slow diffusive buoyancy gain due to vertical (diapycnal) 
  mixing (see also <a href="284.htm">Section 7.3.3</a>; e.g., Winton, 1995). Major 
  sites of known open ocean deep convection are the centre of the Greenland Sea 
  (Schott et al., 1993; Visbeck et al., 1995), Labrador Sea (LabSea Group, 1998) 
  and a small region in the north-western Mediterranean Sea (Schott et al., 1996). 
  However, only the Labrador Sea is in direct contact with the NADW which replenishes 
  the deep waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. In the Greenland 
  Sea deep and bottom waters remain local to the Arctic Ocean and deep basins 
  north of Iceland and have no direct influence on the Denmark Strait Overflow 
  (Mauritzen, 1996). Deep water formed in the Mediterranean Sea also never directly 
  outflows through the Strait of Gibraltar. Dense water also forms on the shelf 
  where convection can reach to the sea floor producing a well-mixed layer of 
  dense water. Several mechanisms, such as eddies, flow over canyons and time-varying 
  shelf break fronts, allow the dense water to enter into the deep ocean via descending 
  plumes. This &#145;shelf convection' is believed to be fairly widespread 
  around the Antarctic continent and is probably the primary mechanism by which 
  AABW is formed (Orsi et al., 1999). AABW is the densest bottom water and penetrates 
  into all of the three major oceans.</p>
<p> The overall effect of open ocean convection is usually parametrized through 
  simple convective-adjustment schemes (Marotzke, 1991) which have been found 
  to work well (Klinger et al., 1996). More advanced schemes have a somewhat increased 
  performance (Paluszkiewicz and Romea, 1997). Lateral exchange between the deep 
  convective centres and the surrounding boundary currents can significantly alter 
  the convective process (Maxworthy, 1997). Within those small regions, deep mixing 
  is affected by mesoscale eddies in two ways: cyclonic eddies provide an additional 
  preconditioning (Legg et al., 1998), and collectively exchange fluid with the 
  periphery of the deep mixed region. Coarse and medium resolution ocean models 
  have shown significantly improved simulations of the deep convective regions 
  when more sophisticated parametrizations of mesoscale eddies were employed (Danabasoglu 
  and McWilliams, 1995; Visbeck et al., 1997). In particular the unrealistic widespread 
  convective mixing (&gt;500 m) over much of the Southern Ocean was significantly 
  reduced.</p>
<p> Shelf plume convection is more difficult to represent in coarse resolution 
  climate models. The problem is challenging because shelf convection is heavily 
  influenced by the details of the bathymetry, coastal fronts and mesoscale eddies 
  (Gwarkiewicz and Chapman, 1995), as well as entrainment of the ambient water 
  (Baringer and Price, 1997). Several different attempts have been made to parametrize 
  its overall effect (e.g., Beckmann and D&ouml;scher, 1997; Killworth and Edwards, 
  1999). Most ocean models have, however, not yet implemented such schemes and 
  ventilate, e.g., the Southern Ocean by means of extensive open ocean (polynya) 
  convection. The effect on the sensitivity of the current coupled climate models 
  to forcings which involve changes in the convective processes is not known.</p>
<p> The convective activity in the Greenland and Labrador Seas varies inversely 
  on decadal time-scales (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="058.htm">Section 
  2.2.2.5</a>). The switch of the convective activity from the Greenland Sea to 
  the Labrador Sea has been attributed to changes in the index of the North Atlantic 
  Oscillation (Dickson et al., 1996). The magnitude of the corresponding change 
  in THC intensity is, however, controversial. While model results suggest moderate 
  fluctuations (10 to 15%), it has been claimed from analysis of hydrographic 
  observations that these changes might be much larger, with heat transport changes 
  of more than 0.3 PW at 48&deg;N, and in excess of 0.5 PW at 36&deg;N (Koltermann 
  et al., 1999).</p>
<p> In summary, the representation of oceanic convection in current climate models 
  is satisfactory to simulate the convection changes observed over the last decades. 
  It is, however, not certain that current schemes will work equally well in situations 
  that involve substantial changes in the THC. </p>
