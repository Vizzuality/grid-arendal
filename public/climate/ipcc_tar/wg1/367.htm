<h4>9.3.6.4 Tropical cyclones</h4>
<p>Here we assess only AOGCM-related results pertaining to tropical cyclones. 
  For further discussion of results from embedded and mesoscale models regarding 
  possible future changes in tropical cyclone activity, see <a href="373.htm">Chapter 
  10</a> (also refer to <a href="388.htm#box102">Box 10.2</a> for a summary). 
  The ability of global models to accurately represent tropical cyclone phenomena, 
  and their present limitations in this regard, is important for understanding 
  their projection of possible future changes. These capabilities are discussed 
  in detail in <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the global climate models suggest an increase in tropical storm intensities 
  with CO<sub>2</sub>-induced warming (Krishnamurti et al., 1998), though a limitation 
  of that study is the short two year model run. However, the highest resolution 
  global climate model experiment reported to date (Bengtsson et al., 1996; see 
  <a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>) still has a resolution too coarse (about 1&deg;) 
  to simulate the most intense storms or realistically simulate structures such 
  as the hurricane eye.</p>
<p>Indices of tropical cyclone activity (Gray, 1979) summarise the necessary large-scale 
  conditions for tropical cyclone activity from coarse resolution GCMs (Evans 
  and Kempisty, 1998; Royer et al., 1998). The latter study examined large-scale 
  atmospheric and oceanic conditions (vertical shear, vorticity and thermo-dynamic 
  stability), and suggested that only small changes in the tropical cyclone frequencies 
  would occur (up to a 10% increase in the Northern Hemisphere primarily in the 
  north-west Pacific, and up to a 5% decrease in the Southern Hemisphere). Climate 
  change studies to date show a great sensitivity to the measure of convective 
  activity chosen, and depend less on the model produced fields. Additionally, 
  the broad geographic regions of cyclogenesis, and therefore also the regions 
  affected by tropical cyclones, are not expected to change significantly (Henderson-Sellers 
  et al., 1998). This is because results from Holland's (1997) Maximum Potential 
  Intensity model show that even with substantial (1 to 2&deg;C) SST increases 
  in the tropics from global warming, one would also get a correspondingly much 
  bigger warming in the upper troposphere leading to very little change in the 
  moist static stability (Holland, 1997). Another study shows areas of deep convection 
  that can be associated with tropical cyclone formation would not expand with 
  increases in CO<sub>2</sub> due to an increase of the SST threshold for occurrence of deep 
  convection (Dutton et al., 2000). Additionally, since tropical storm activity 
  in most basins is modulated by El Ni&ntilde;o/La Ni&ntilde;a conditions in the 
  tropical Pacific, projections of future regional changes in tropical storm frequencies 
  may depend on accurate projections of future El Ni&ntilde;o conditions, an area 
  of considerable uncertainty for climate models (as noted in <a href="361.htm">Section 
  9.3.5.2</a>). </p>
