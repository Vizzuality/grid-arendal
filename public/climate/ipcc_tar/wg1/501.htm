<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Further work is required to improve the ability to detect, attribute, and understand 
  climate change, to reduce uncertainties, and to project future climate changes. 
  In particular, there is a need for additional systematic observations, modelling 
  and process studies. A serious concern is the decline of observational networks. 
  Further work is needed in eight broad areas:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reverse the decline of observational networks in many parts of the world. 
    Unless networks are significantly improved, it may be difficult or impossible 
    to detect climate change over large parts of the globe.</li>
  <li>Sustain and expand the observational foundation for climate studies by providing 
    accurate, long-term, consistent data including implementation of a strategy 
    for integrated global observations. Given the complexity of the climate system 
    and the inherent multi-decadal time-scale, there is a need for long-term consistent 
    data to support climate and environmental change investigations and projections. 
    Data from the present and recent past, climate-relevant data for the last 
    few centuries, and for the last several millennia are all needed. There is 
    a particular shortage of data in polar regions and data for the quantitative 
    assessment of extremes on the global scale.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Understand better the mechanisms and factors leading to changes in radiative 
    forcing; in particular, improve the observations of the spatial distribution 
    of greenhouse gases and aerosols. It is particularly important that improvements 
    are realised in deriving concentrations from emissions of gases and particularly 
    aerosols, and in addressing biogeochemical sequestration and cycling, and 
    specifically, in determining the spatial-temporal distribution of carbon dioxide 
    (CO<sub>2</sub>) sources and sinks, currently and in the future. Observations are needed 
    that would decisively improve our ability to model the carbon cycle; in addition, 
    a dense and well-calibrated network of stations for monitoring CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen 
    (O<sub>2</sub>) concentrations will also be required for international verification of 
    carbon sinks. Improvements in deriving concentrations from emissions of gases 
    and in the prediction and assessment of direct and indirect aerosol forcing 
    will require an integrated effort involving in situ observations, satellite 
    remote sensing, field campaigns and modelling.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Understand and characterise the important unresolved processes and feedbacks, 
    both physical and biogeochemical, in the climate system. Increased understanding 
    is needed to improve prognostic capabilities generally. The interplay of observation 
    and models will be the key for progress. The rapid forcing of a non-linear 
    system has a high prospect of producing surprises.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Address more completely patterns of long-term climate variability including 
    the occurrence of extreme events. This topic arises both in model calculations 
    and in the climate system. In simulations, the issue of climate drift within 
    model calculations needs to be clarified better in part because it compounds 
    the difficulty of distinguishing signal and noise. With respect to the long-term 
    natural variability in the climate system per se, it is important to understand 
    this variability and to expand the emerging capability of predicting patterns 
    of organised variability such as El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). 
    This predictive capability is both a valuable test of model performance and 
    a useful contribution in natural resource and economic management.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Improve methods to quantify uncertainties of climate projections and scenarios, 
    including development and exploration of long-term ensemble simulations using 
    complex models. The climate system is a coupled non-linear chaotic system, 
    and therefore the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible. 
    Rather the focus must be upon the prediction of the probability distribution 
    of the system's future possible states by the generation of ensembles 
    of model solutions. Addressing adequately the statistical nature of climate 
    is computationally intensive and requires the application of new methods of 
    model diagnosis, but such statistical information is essential. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Improve the integrated hierarchy of global and regional climate models with 
    a focus on the simulation of climate variability, regional climate changes, 
    and extreme events. There is the potential for increased understanding of 
    extremes events by employing regional climate models; however, there are also 
    challenges in realising this potential. It will require improvements in the 
    understanding of the coupling between the major atmospheric, oceanic, and 
    terrestrial systems, and extensive diagnostic modelling and observational 
    studies that evaluate and improve simulation performance. A particularly important 
    issue is the adequacy of data needed to attack the question of changes in 
    extreme events.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Link models of the physical climate and the biogeochemical system more effectively, 
    and in turn improve coupling with descriptions of human activities. At present, 
    human influences generally are treated only through emission scenarios that 
    provide external forcings to the climate system. In future more comprehensive 
    models, human activities need to begin to interact with the dynamics of physical, 
    chemical, and biological sub-systems through a diverse set of contributing 
    activities, feedbacks, and responses.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Cutting across these foci are crucial needs associated with strengthening international 
  co-operation and co-ordination in order to utilise better scientific, computational, 
  and observational resources. This should also promote the free exchange of data 
  among scientists. A special need is to increase the observational and research 
  capacities in many regions, particularly in developing countries. Finally, as 
  is the goal of this assessment, there is a continuing imperative to communicate 
  research advances in terms that are relevant to decision making.<br>
</p>
<p>The challenges to understanding the Earth system, including the human component, 
  are daunting, but these challenges simply must be met.</p>
