<h2>4.5 Open Questions</h2>
<p>Many processes involving atmospheric chemistry, and the coupling of atmospheric 
  chemistry with other elements of global change, have been proposed in the scientific 
  literature. These are generally based on sound physical and chemical principles, 
  but unfortunately, there is no consensus on their quantitative role in atmospheric 
  chemistry on a global scale (e.g., the effects of clouds on tropospheric ozone: 
  Lelieveld and Crutzen (1990) vs. Liang and Jacob (1997)), on the magnitude of 
  possible compensating effects (e.g., net settling of HNO<sub>3</sub> on cloud 
  particles: Lawrence and Crutzen (1999) vs. full cloud-scale dynamics), or even 
  on how to implement them or whether these are already effectively included in 
  many of the model calculations. While many of these processes may be important, 
  there is inadequate information or consensus to make a quantitative evaluation 
  in this assessment. This assessment is not a review, and so this section presents 
  only a few examples of recent publications studying feedbacks or chemical processes, 
  which are not included, but which are potentially important in this assessment. 
</p>
<h3><a name="451"></a>4.5.1 Chemical Processes Important on the Global Scale</h3>
<h4><a name="4511"></a>4.5.1.1 Missing chemistry, representation of small scales, 
  and changing emission patterns</h4>
<p>Analyses and observations (see <a href="143.htm#426">Section 4.2.6</a>) continue 
  to test and improve the chemistry and transport used in the global CTMs. In 
  terms of the chemistry, recent studies have looked, for example, at the representation 
  of NMHC chemistry (Houweling et al. 1998; Wang et al. 1998b), the role of halogens 
  in the O<sub>3</sub> budget of the remote marine troposphere, and the acetone 
  source of upper tropospheric OH (see <a href="142.htm">Sections 4.2.4</a> and 
  <a href="143.htm#426">4.2.6</a>). Most of these improvements in understanding 
  will eventually become adopted as standard in the global CTMs, but at this stage, 
  for example, the role of tropospheric halogen chemistry on the Y2100 predictions 
  has not been evaluated in the CTMs.</p>
<p>Convection, as well as urban pollution and biomass burning plumes, occur on 
  horizontal scales not resolved in global CTMs. These sub-grid features appear 
  to be important in calculating OH abundances and O<sub>3</sub> production for 
  biomass burning emissions (Pickering et al., 1996; Folkins et al., 1997), for 
  the remote upper troposphere (Jaegl&eacute; et al., 1997; Prather and Jacob, 
  1997; Wennberg et al., 1998), and in urban plumes (e.g., Sillman et al., 1990). 
  Convection is represented in all CTMs here (e.g., Collins et al., 1999; M&uuml;ller 
  and Brasseur, 1999) but in quite different ways, and it still involves parametrization 
  of processes occurring on a sub-grid scale. A substantial element of the differences 
  in CTM simulations appears to lie with the different representations of convection 
  and boundary layer transport, particularly for the short-lived gases such as 
  NO<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p>A change in the geographic emission pattern of the pollutants (NO<sub>x</sub>, 
  CO and VOC) can by itself alter tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> and OH abundances 
  and in turn the abundances of CH<sub>4</sub> and HFCs. In one study of regional 
  NO<sub>x</sub> emissions and control strategy, Fuglestvedt et al. (1999) find 
  that upper tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> is most sensitive to NO<sub>x</sub> reductions 
  in Southeast Asia and Australia and least to those in Scandinavia. Understanding 
  trends in CO requires knowledge not only of the in situ chemistry of CO (e.g., 
  Granier et al., 1996; Kanakidou and Crutzen, 1999), but also of how local pollution 
  control has altered the global pattern of emissions (e.g., Hallock-Waters et 
  al., 1999). These shifts have been included to some extent in the SRES emissions 
  for year 2100 used here; however, the projected change in emission patterns 
  have not been formally evaluated within the atmospheric chemistry community 
  in terms of uncertainty in the Y2100 global atmosphere.</p>
