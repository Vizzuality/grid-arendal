<h3><a name="fig414"></a>4.4.5 Atmospheric Composition for the IPCC Scenarios 
  to 2100</h3>
<p>Mean tropospheric abundances of greenhouse gases and other chemical changes 
  in the atmosphere are calculated by this chapter for years 2000 to 2100 from 
  the SRES scenarios for anthropogenic emissions of CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, 
  HFCs, PFCs, SF<sub>6</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, CO, and VOC (corresponding emissions 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> and aerosol precursors are not used). The emissions from the 
  six SRES marker/illustrative scenarios (A1B, A1T, A1FI, A2, B1, B2) are tabulated 
  in <a href="519.htm">Appendix II</a>, as are the resulting greenhouse gas abundances, 
  including CO<sub>2</sub> and aerosol burdens. Chlorine- and bromine-containing 
  greenhouse gases are not calculated here, and we adopt the single baseline scenario 
  from the WMO assessment (Montreal Protocol Scenario A1 of Madronich and Velders, 
  1999), which is reproduced in <a href="519.htm">Appendix II</a>. Also given 
  in <a href="519.htm">Appendix II</a> are the parallel data for the SRES preliminary 
  marker scenarios (A1p, A2p, B1p, B2p) and, in many cases, the SAR scenario IS92a 
  as a comparison with the previous assessment.<br>
</p>
<p>Greenhouse gas abundances are calculated using a methodology similar to the 
  SAR: (1) The troposphere is treated as a single box with a fill-factor for each 
  gas that relates the burden to the tropospheric mean abundance (e.g., Tg/ppb). 
  (2) The atmospheric lifetime for each gas is recalculated each year based on 
  conditions at the beginning of the year and the formulae in <a href="151.htm#tab411">Table 
  4.11</a>. (Changes in tropospheric OH are used to scale the lifetimes of CH<sub>4</sub> 
  and HFCs, and the abundance of N<sub>2</sub>O is used to calculate its new lifetime.) 
  (3) The abundance of a gas is integrated exactly over the year assuming that 
  emissions remain constant for 12 months. (4) Abundances are annual means, reported 
  at the beginning of each year (e.g., year 2100 = 1 January 2100).</p>
<p>In the SAR, the only OH feedback considered was that of CH<sub>4</sub> on its 
  own lifetime. For this report, we calculate the change in tropospheric OH due 
  to CH<sub>4</sub> abundance as well as the immediate emissions of NO<sub>x</sub>, 
  CO and VOC. Likewise, the increase in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> projected in 
  the SAR considered only increases in CH<sub>4</sub>; whereas now it includes 
  the emissions of NO<sub>x</sub>, CO and VOC. Thus the difference between IS92a 
  in the SAR and in this report is similar to that noted by Kheshgi et al. (1999). 
  Also, the feedback of N<sub>2</sub>O on its lifetime is included here for the 
  first time and shows up as reduction of 14 ppb by year 2100 in this report's 
  IS92a scenario as compared to the SAR.</p>
<p>The 21st century abundances of CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, tropospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub>, HFC-134a, CF<sub>4</sub>, and SF<sub>6</sub> for the SRES scenarios 
  are shown in <a href="#fig414">Figure 4.14</a>. Historical data are plotted 
  before year 2000; and the SRES projections, thereafter to year 2100. CH<sub>4</sub> 
  continues to rise in B2, A1FI, and A2 (like IS92a), with abundances reaching 
  2,970 to 3,730 ppb, in order. For A1B and A1T, CH<sub>4</sub> peaks in mid-century 
  at about 2,500 ppb and then falls. For B1, CH<sub>4</sub> levels off and eventually 
  falls to 1980-levels by year 2100. N<sub>2</sub>O continues to rise in all scenarios, 
  reflecting in part its long lifetime, and abundances by the end of the century 
  range from 350 to 460 ppb. Most scenarios lead to increases in tropospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub>, with scenarios A1FI and A2 projecting the maximum tropospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub> burdens of 55 DU by year 2100. This increase of about 60% from 
  today is more than twice the change from pre-industrial to present. Scenario 
  B1 is alone in projecting an overall decline in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> over 
  most of the century: the drop to 30 DU is about halfway back to pre-industrial 
  values. HFC-134a, the HFC with the largest projected abundance, is expected 
  to reach about 900 ppt by year 2100 for all scenarios except B1. Likewise by 
  2100, the abundance of CF<sub>4</sub> rises to 340 to 400 ppt in all scenarios 
  except B1. The projected increase in SF<sub>6</sub> is much smaller in absolute 
  abundance, reaching about 60 ppt in scenarios A1 and A2. For the major non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  greenhouse gases, the SRES A2 and A1FI increases are similar to, but slightly 
  larger than, those of IS92a. The SRES mix of lesser greenhouse gases (HFCs, 
  PFCs, SF<sub>6</sub>) and their abundances are increased substantially relative 
  to IS92a. The summed radiative forcings from these gases plus CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and aerosols are given in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<p>The chemistry of the troposphere is changing notably in these scenarios, and 
  this is illustrated in <a href="#fig414">Figure 4.14</a> with the lifetime (LT) 
  of CH<sub>4</sub> and the change in mean tropospheric OH relative to year 2000. 
  In all scenarios except B1, OH decreases 10% or more by the end of the century, 
  pushing the lifetime of CH<sub>4</sub> up from 8.4 years, to 9.2 to 10.0 years. 
  While increasing emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> in most of these scenarios increases 
  O<sub>3</sub> and would tend to increase OH (see notes to <a href="151.htm#tab411">Table 
  4.11</a>), the increase in CH<sub>4</sub> abundance and the greater CO emissions 
  appear to dominate, driving OH down. In such an atmosphere, emissions of CH<sub>4</sub> 
  and HFCs persist longer with greater greenhouse impact. In contrast the B1 atmosphere 
  is more readily able to oxidise these compounds and reduce their impact.</p>
