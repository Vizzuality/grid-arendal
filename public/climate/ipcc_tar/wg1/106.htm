<h4>3.2.3.3 Future changes in ocean CO<sub>2</sub> uptake</h4>
<p>This section lists processes that may be important for the future uptake of 
  anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>. These changes can represent changes in anthropogenic 
  CO<sub>2</sub> uptake itself (mainly physical and chemical processes), or changes 
  in the natural biologically-linked cycling of carbon between the atmosphere 
  and ocean. </p>
<p><i>Physical and chemical processes</i><br>
  <b>Buffering changes.</b> The capacity of surface waters to take up anthropogenic 
  CO<sub>2</sub> is decreasing as CO<sub>2</sub> levels increase (see <a href="104.htm#box33">Box 
  3.3</a>). The magnitude of this effect is substantial. This decrease in uptake 
  capacity of the ocean makes atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> more sensitive to anthropogenic 
  emissions and other changes in the natural cycling of carbon.<br>
  <b>Emissions rate.</b> Even assuming no other changes to the carbon cycle, the 
  proportion of emitted CO<sub>2</sub> that can be taken up by the ocean decreases 
  as the rate of emission increases. This is due to the finite rate of exposure 
  of &#145;older', deeper waters to the anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> contained 
  in the atmosphere. <br>
  <b>Warming.</b> CO<sub>2</sub> is less soluble in warmer water, and the equilibrium 
  <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in seawater increases by about 10 to 20 ppm per &deg;C 
  temperature increase. Warming of surface water would therefore tend to increase 
  surface water <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>, driving CO<sub>2</sub> from the surface 
  ocean to the atmosphere. The expected effect of such warming on atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> may be smaller, depending on the rate of exchange between ocean 
  surface waters and the deep ocean at high latitudes (e.g., Bacastow, 1993). 
  <br>
  <b>Vertical mixing and stratification.</b> Several coupled atmosphere-ocean 
  models have shown global warming to be accompanied by an increase in vertical 
  stratification (see <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>). Such a change would reduce 
  the rate of mixing between surface and deep waters, and therefore reduce the 
  effective volume of the ocean that is exposed to high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. 
  On its own, this effect would tend to reduce the ocean CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. 
  However, changes in stratification may also drive changes in the natural carbon 
  cycle. The magnitude and even the sign of changes in the natural cycle are much 
  more difficult to predict because of the complexity of ocean biological processes 
  (Sarmiento et al., 1998; Matear and Hirst, 1999).</p>
<p><i>Biologically-linked processes</i><br>
  Qualitative and quantitative changes in carbon uptake arising from changes in 
  marine ecosystems are more speculative (Denman et al., 1996; Falkowski et al., 
  1998; Watson and Liss, 1998), but are likely to have occurred over glacial-interglacial 
  time-scales (<a href="107.htm">Section 3.3</a>). Falkowski et al. (1998) listed 
  three major classes of biologically linked factors that can in principal alter 
  the air-sea partitioning of CO<sub>2</sub>: (1) changes in surface nutrient 
  utilisation (e.g., in HNLC areas); (2) changes in total ocean content of major 
  nutrients; (3) changes in the elemental composition of biogenic material (including 
  the rain ratio). Our incomplete understanding of present day nutrient controls 
  on productivity limits our ability to predict future changes in ocean biology 
  and their effect on CO<sub>2</sub> levels. For example, the possible identification 
  of changes in deep ocean C:N:P ratios (Pahlow and Riebesell, 2000) leaves open 
  the question of the extent to which ocean biological carbon cycling is in steady 
  state, or is likely to remain so in the future. </p>
<p><b>Changes in surface nutrient utilisation.</b> Changes in the utilisation 
  of surface nutrients in HNLC regions have the potential to alter export production 
  and carbon storage in the ocean interior. Most attention focuses on the role 
  of inadvertent or deliberate changes in the external supply of iron to such 
  regions. The sign of possible future responses of ocean biota due to iron supply 
  changes is difficult to assess. Future iron supply may increase due to erosion 
  (enhanced by agriculture and urbanisation) which tends to increase dust export 
  and aeolian iron deposition (Tegen and Fung, 1995). Conversely, a globally enhanced 
  hydrological cycle and increased water-use efficiency of terrestrial plants 
  may tend to reduce future dust export (Harrison et al., 2001). The delivery 
  of dust to the HNLC regions will be sensitive to regional changes in erosion 
  and the hydrological cycle, affecting the important regions of dust export, 
  rather than to global scale changes (Dai et al., 1998).<br>
  Surface nutrient supply could be reduced if ocean stratification reduces the 
  supply of major nutrients carried to the surface waters from the deep ocean 
  (Sarmiento et al., 1998). The impact of stratification on marine productivity 
  depends on the limiting factor. In regions limited by deep ocean nutrients, 
  stratification would reduce marine productivity and the strength of the export 
  of carbon by biological processes. Conversely, stratification also increases 
  the light exposure of marine organisms, which would increase productivity in 
  regions where light is limiting. </p>
<p><b>Changes in total ocean content of major nutrients.</b> Changes in the delivery 
  of the major biologically limiting nutrients (N, P, Fe, Si) from riverine, atmospheric 
  or sedimentary sources, or changes in removal rates (e.g., denitrification), 
  could alter oceanic nutrient inventories and hence export production and ocean 
  carbon storage. On the global scale, the upward fluxes of major nutrients are 
  slightly depleted in N relative to P with respect to the nutrient requirements 
  of phytoplankton (Fanning, 1992). This relative supply of N versus P may be 
  sensitive to climate and circulation related changes in the rate of fixed-nitrogen 
  removal by denitrification (Ganeshram et al., 1995) or via changes in the rate 
  of nitrogen fixation. Changes in river flow and composition are also affecting 
  the supply of nutrients (Frankignoulle et al., 1998). The hypothesised link 
  between nitrogen fixation in certain ocean regions and the external iron supply 
  (Falkowski, 1997; Wu et al., 2000) could play a role in future nutrient and 
  carbon budgets. Nitrogen fixation rates may also be affected by changes in stratification 
  and mixing. For example, Karl et al. (1997) have identified interannual variability 
  in nitrogen fixation rates in the sub-tropical Pacific which are apparently 
  linked to ENSO variability in upper ocean dynamics.</p>
<p><b>Changes in the elemental composition of biogenic material.</b> The structure 
  and biogeochemistry of marine ecosystems can be affected by numerous climate-related 
  factors including temperature, cloudiness, nutrient availability, mixed-layer 
  physics and sea-ice extent. In turn the structure of marine ecosystems, and 
  particularly the species composition of phytoplankton, exert a control on the 
  partitioning of carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere. For example, a 
  change in distribution of calcareous versus siliceous planktonic organisms could 
  affect CO<sub>2</sub> uptake in the future, as it may have done in the past 
  (Archer and Maier-Reimer, 1994). Precipitation of CaCO<sub>3</sub> by marine 
  organisms (calcification) removes dissolved CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, thus 
  decreasing surface water alkalinity and reducing the capacity of sea water to 
  dissolve atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (see <a href="104.htm#box33">Box 3.3</a>). 
  Recent experimental evidence suggests that as a direct result of increasing 
  atmospheric and surface water <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> levels, oceanic calcification 
  will decrease significantly over the next 100 years. Model-based calculations 
  suggest that decreases in coral reef calcification rates of the order 17 to 
  35% relative to pre-industrial rates are possible (Kleypas et al., 1999). Experimental 
  studies with corals have confirmed such effects (Langdon et al., 2000). Field 
  and laboratory studies have shown that planktonic calcification is also highly 
  sensitive to <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The calcification rate of coccolithophorids 
  decreases by 16 to 83% at <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> levels of 750 ppm (Riebesell 
  et al., 2000). Such an effect would tend to favour CO<sub>2</sub> storage in 
  the upper ocean and act as a negative feedback on atmospheric growth rates of 
  CO<sub>2</sub>. However, long-term predictions of such biological responses 
  are hampered by a lack of understanding concerning physiological acclimation 
  and genetic adaptations of species to increasing pCO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 3.4: Causes of glacial/inter-glacial changes 
        in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. </b> </div>
      <p>One family of hypotheses to explain glacial/inter-glacial variations 
        of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> relies on physical mechanisms that could 
        change the dissolution and outgassing of CO<sub>2</sub> in the ocean. 
        The solubility of CO<sub>2</sub> is increased at low temperature, but 
        reduced at high salinity. These effects nearly cancel out over the glacial/inter-glacial 
        cycle, so simple solubility changes are not the answer. Stephens and Keeling 
        (2000) have proposed that extended winter sea ice prevented outgassing 
        of upwelled, CO<sub>2</sub>-rich water around the Antarctic continent 
        during glacial times. A melt-water "cap" may have further restricted 
        outgassing of CO<sub>2</sub> during summer (Fran&ccedil;ois et al., 1997). 
        These mechanisms could explain the parallel increases of Antarctic temperature 
        and CO<sub>2</sub> during deglaciation. However, they require less vertical 
        mixing to occur at low latitudes than is normally assumed. The relative 
        importance of high and low latitudes for the transport of CO<sub>2</sub> 
        by physical processes is not well known, and may be poorly represented 
        in most ocean carbon models (Toggweiler, 1999; Broecker et al., 1999).</p>
      <p>Several authors have hypothesised increased utilisation of surface nutrients 
        by marine ecosystems in high latitudes, leading to stronger vertical gradients 
        of DIC and thus reduced atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during glacial times 
        (Sarmiento and Toggweiler, 1984; Siegenthaler and Wenk, 1984; Knox and 
        McElroy, 1984). Other hypotheses call for an increased external supply 
        of nutrients to the ocean (McElroy, 1983; Martin et al., 1990; Broecker 
        and Henderson, 1998). The supply of iron-rich dust to the Southern Ocean 
        is increased during glacial periods, due to expanded deserts in the Patagonian 
        source region (Andersen et al., 1998; Mahowald et al., 1999; Petit et 
        al., 1999); dust-borne iron concentration in Antarctic ice is also increased 
        (Edwards et al., 1998). Fertilisation of marine productivity by iron from 
        this source could have influenced atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Most of 
        these mechanisms, however, can only account for about 30 ppm, or less, 
        of the change (Lef&egrave;vre and Watson, 1999; Archer and Johnson, 2000). 
        Palaeo-nutrient proxies have also been used to argue against large changes 
        in total high latitude productivity (Boyle, 1988; Rickaby and Elderfield, 
        1999; Elderfield and Rickaby, 2000), even if the region of high productivity 
        in the Southern Ocean may have been shifted to the north (Kumar et al., 
        1995; Fran&ccedil;ois et al., 1997). Increased productivity over larger 
        regions might have been caused by decreased denitrification (Altabet et 
        al., 1995; Ganeshram et al., 1995) or iron stimulated N<sub>2</sub> fixation 
        (Broecker and Henderson, 1998) leading to an increase in the total ocean 
        content of reactive nitrogen.</p>
      <p>Another family of hypotheses invokes ocean alkalinity changes by a variety 
        of mechanisms (Opdyke and Walker, 1992; Archer and Maier-Reimer, 1994; 
        Kleypas, 1997), including increased silica supply through dust, promoting 
        export production by siliceous rather than calcareous phytoplankton (Harrison, 
        2000). Although there is geochemical evidence for higher ocean pH during 
        glacial times (Sanyal et al., 1995), a large increase in alkalinity would 
        result in a much deeper lysocline, implying an increase in CaCO<sub>3</sub> 
        preservation that is not observed in deep-sea sediments (Catubig et al., 
        1998; Sigman et al., 1998; Archer et al., 2000).</p>
      <p>Given the complex timing of changes between climate changes and atmospheric 
        CO<sub>2</sub> on glacial-interglacial time-scales, it is plausible that 
        more than one mechanism has been in operation; and indeed most or all 
        of the hypotheses encounter difficulties if called upon individually to 
        explain the full magnitude of the change.</p>
