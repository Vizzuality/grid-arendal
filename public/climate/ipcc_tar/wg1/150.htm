<h3>4.4.3 Testing CTM Simulation of the Current (Y2000) Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The OxComp workshop defined a series of atmospheres and emission scenarios. 
  These included Y2000, a new reference atmosphere meant to represent year 2000 
  that provides a baseline from which all changes in greenhouse gases were calculated. 
  For Y2000, abundances of long-lived gases were prescribed by 1998 measurements 
  (<a href="130.htm#tab41a">Table 4.1a</a>), and emissions of short-lived pollutants, 
  NO<sub>x</sub>, CO and VOC, were based primarily on projections to the year 
  2000 of GEIA/EDGAR emissions for 1990 (Olivier et al., 1998, 1999), see <a href="147.htm">Section 
  4.3.1</a>. Stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> was calculated in some models and prescribed 
  by current observation in others. The predicted atmospheric quantities in all 
  these simulations are therefore short-lived tropospheric gases: O<sub>3</sub>, 
  CO, NO<sub>x</sub>, VOC, OH and other radicals. Following the GIM model study 
  (Kanakidou et al., 1999), we use atmospheric measurement of O<sub>3</sub> and 
  CO to test the model simulations of the current atmosphere. The Y2000 atmosphere 
  was chosen because of the need for an IPCC baseline, and it does not try to 
  match conditions over the l980s and 1990s from which the measurements come. 
  Although the observed trends in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> and CO are not particularly 
  large over this period and thus justify the present approach, a more thorough 
  comparison of model results and measurements would need to use the regional 
  distribution of the pollutant emissions for the observation period.</p>
<p>The seasonal cycle of O<sub>3</sub> in the free troposphere (700, 500, and 
  300 hPa) has been observed over the past decade from more than thirty ozone 
  sonde stations (Logan, 1999). These measurements are compared with the OxComp 
  Y2000 simulations for Resolute (75&deg;N), Hohenpeissenberg (48&deg;N), Boulder 
  (40&deg;N), Tateno (36&deg;N), and Hilo (20&deg;N) in <a href="#fig410">Figure 
  4.10</a>. Surface measurements from Cape Grim (40&deg;S), representative of 
  the marine boundary layer in southern mid-latitudes, are also compared with 
  the models in <a href="#fig410">Figure 4.10</a>. With the exception of a few 
  outliers, the model simulations are within &plusmn;30% of observed tropospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub> abundance, and they generally show a maximum in spring to early 
  summer as observed, although they often miss the month of maximum O<sub>3</sub>. 
  At 300 hPa the large springtime variation at many stations is due to the influence 
  of stratospheric air that is approximately simulated at Resolute, but, usually 
  overestimated at the other stations. The CTM simulations in the tropics (Hilo) 
  at 700 to 500 hPa show much greater spread and hence generally worse agreement 
  with observations. The mean concentration of surface O<sub>3</sub> observed 
  at Cape Grim is well matched by most models, but the seasonality is underestimated. 
</p>
<p>Observed CO abundances are compared with the Y2000 model simulations in <a href="#fig411">Figure 
  4.11</a> for surface sites at various altitudes and latitudes: Cape Grim (CGA, 
  94 m), Tae Ahn (KOR, 20 m), Mauna Loa (MLH, 3397 m), Alert (ALT, 210 m), and 
  Niwot Ridge (NWR, 3475 m). The Alert abundances are well matched by most but 
  not all models. Niwot Ridge and Mauna Loa are reasonably well modelled except 
  for the February to March maximum. At Tae Ahn, the models miss the deep minimum 
  in late summer, but do predict the much larger abundances downwind of Asian 
  sources. At Cape Grim the seasonal cycle is matched, but the CO abundance is 
  uniformly overestimated (30 to 50%) by all the models, probably indicating an 
  error in Southern Hemisphere emissions of CO.</p>
<p>Overall, this comparison with CO and O<sub>3</sub> observations shows good 
  simulations by the OxComp models of the global scale chemical features of the 
  current troposphere as evidenced by CO and O<sub>3</sub>; however, the critical 
  NO<sub>x</sub> chemistry emphasises variability on much smaller scales, such 
  as biomass burning plumes and lightning storms, that are not well represented 
  by the global models. With this large variability and small scales, the database 
  of NO<sub>x</sub> measurements needed to provide a test for the global models, 
  equivalent to CO and O<sub>3</sub>, would need to be much larger.<br>
  The current NO<sub>x</sub> database (e.g., Emmons et al., 1997; Thakur et al., 
  1999) does not provide critical tests of CTM treatment of these sub-grid scales.</p>
