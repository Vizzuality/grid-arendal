<p>Only during the 1980s was the possibility of rapid climatic changes occurring 
  at the time-scale of human life more or less fully recognised, largely due to 
  the Greenland ice core drilled at Dye 3 in Southern Greenland (Dansgaard et 
  al., 1982, 1989). A possible link between such events and the mode of operation 
  of the ocean was then subsequently suggested (Oeschger et al., 1984; Broecker 
  et al., 1985; see Broecker, 1997, for a recent review). The SAR reviewed the 
  evidence of such changes since the peak of the last inter-glacial period about 
  120 ky BP (thousands of years Before Present). It concluded that: (1) large 
  and rapid climatic changes occurred during the last Ice Age and during the transition 
  towards the present Holocene; (2) temperatures were far less variable during 
  this latter period; and (3) suggestions that rapid changes may have also occurred 
  during the last inter-glacial required confirmation.</p>
<p>These changes are now best documented from ice core, deep-sea sediment and 
  continental records. Complementary and generally discontinuous information comes 
  from coral and lake level data. The time-scale for the Pleistocene deep-sea 
  core record is based on the orbitally tuned oxygen isotope record from marine 
  sediments (Martinson et al., 1987), constrained by two radiometrically dated 
  horizons, the peak of the last inter-glacial (about 124 ky BP) and the Brunhes/Matuyama 
  reversal of the Earth's magnetic field at about 780 ky BP. <sup>14</sup>C-dating 
  is also used in the upper 50 ky BP; the result is a deep-sea core chronology 
  believed to be accurate to within a few per cent for the last million years. 
  <sup>14</sup>C-dating is also used for dating continental records as well as 
  the counting of annual layers in tree rings and varved lake records, whereas 
  ice-core chron-ologies are obtained by combining layer counting, glaciological 
  models and comparison with other dated records. The use of globally representative 
  records, such as changes in continental ice volume recorded in the isotopic 
  composition of deep-sea sediments, or changes in atmospheric composition recorded 
  in air bubbles trapped in ice cores, now allow such local records to be put 
  into a global perspective. Studies still largely focus on the more recent glacial-interglacial 
  cycle (the last 120 to 130 ky). <a href="#tab24">Table 2.4</a> is a guide to 
  terminology.</p>

<p>Before reviewing important recent information about rapid changes, we briefly 
  mention progress made on two aspects of the palaeoclimate record of relevance 
  for future climate. The first deals with the relationship between modern and 
  past terrestrial data and SSTs around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (about 
  20 ky BP); this is important because of the use of glacial data to validate 
  climate models. New results obtained since the SAR both from marine and terrestrial 
  sources (reviewed in <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>), agree on a tropical cooling 
  of about 3&deg;C. The second concerns the greenhouse gas record (CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and CH<sub>4</sub>) which has now been considerably extended due to the recent 
  completion of drilling of the Vostok ice core in central East Antarctica. The 
  strong relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> and Antarctic 
  climate documented over the last climatic cycle has been remarkably confirmed 
  over four climatic cycles, spanning about 420 ky (<a href="#fig222">Figure 2.22</a>). 
  Present day levels of these two important greenhouse gases appear unprecedented 
  during this entire interval (Petit et al., 1999; and <a href="#fig222">Figure 
  2.22</a>). From a detailed study of the last three glacial terminations in the 
  Vostok ice core, Fischer et al. (1999) conclude that CO<sub>2</sub> increases 
  started 600 &plusmn; 400 years after the Antarctic warming. However, considering 
  the large uncertainty in the ages of the CO<sub>2</sub> and ice (1,000 years 
  or more if we consider the ice accumulation rate uncertainty), Petit et al. 
  (1999) felt it premature to ascertain the sign of the phase relationship between 
  CO<sub>2</sub> and Antarctic temperature at the initiation of the terminations. 
  In any event, CO<sub>2</sub> changes parallel Antarctic temperature changes 
  during deglaciations (Sowers and Bender, 1995; Blunier et al., 1997; Petit et 
  al., 1999). This is consistent with a significant contribution of these greenhouse 
  gases to the glacial-interglacial changes by amplifying the initial orbital 
  forcing (Petit et al., 1999). </p>
We also now have a better knowledge of climate variability over the last few climatic 
cycles as illustrated by selected palaeo-temperature records back to about 400 
ky (<a href="#fig223">Figure 2.23</a>). The amplitude of the glacial-interglacial 
temperature change was lower in tropical and equatorial regions (e.g., curve c) 
than in mid- and high latitudes (other curves). During glacial periods, the climate 
of the North Atlantic and adjacent regions (curves a and b) was more variable 
than in the Southern Hemisphere (curve d). Also (not shown), full glacial periods 
were characterised by very high fluxes of dust (seen in ice-core records and in 
continental and marine records). A combination of increased dust source area, 
stronger atmospheric transport and a weaker hydrological cycle (Yung et al., 1996; 
Mahowald et al., 1999; Petit et al., 1999) probably generated these changes.<br>
