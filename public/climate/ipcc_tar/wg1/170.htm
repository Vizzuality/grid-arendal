<h4>5.2.2.4 Carbonaceous aerosols (organic and black carbon)</h4>
<p>Carbonaceous compounds make up a large but highly variable fraction of the 
  atmospheric aerosol (for definitions see Glossary). Organics are the largest 
  single component of biomass burning aerosols (Andreae et al., 1988; Cachier 
  et al., 1995; Artaxo et al., 1998a). Measurements over the Atlantic in the haze 
  plume from the United States indicated that aerosol organics scattered at least 
  as much light as sulphate (Hegg et al., 1997; Novakov et al., 1997). Organics 
  are also important constituents, perhaps even a majority, of upper-tropospheric 
  aerosols (Murphy et al., 1998b). The presence of polar functional groups, particularly 
  carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids, makes many of the organic compounds in aerosols 
  water-soluble and allows them to participate in cloud droplet nucleation (Saxena 
  et al., 1995; Saxena and Hildemann, 1996; Semp&eacute;r&eacute; and Kawamura, 
  1996). Recent field measurements have confirmed that organic aerosols may be 
  efficient cloud nuclei and consequently play an important role for the indirect 
  climate effect as well (Rivera-Carpio et al., 1996).<br>
</p>
<p> There are significant analytical difficulties in making valid measurements 
  of the various organic carbon species in aerosols. Large artefacts can be produced 
  by both adsorption of organics from the gas phase onto aerosol collection media, 
  as well as evaporation of volatile organics from aerosol samples (Appel et al., 
  1983; Turpin et al., 1994; McMurry et al., 1996). The magnitude of these artefacts 
  can be comparable to the amount of organic aerosol in unpolluted locations. 
  Progress has been made on minimising and correcting for these artefacts through 
  several techniques: diffusion denuders to remove gas phase organics (Eatough 
  et al., 1996), impactors with relatively inert surfaces and low pressure drops 
  (Saxena et al., 1995), and thermal desorption analysis to improve the accuracy 
  of corrections from back-up filters (Novakov et al., 1997). No rigorous comparisons 
  of different techniques are available to constrain measurement errors.<br>
</p>
<p> Of particular importance for the direct effect is the light-absorbing character 
  of some carbonaceous species, such as soot and tarry substances. Modelling studies 
  suggest that the abundance of "black carbon" relative to non-absorbing 
  constituents has a strong influence on the magnitude of the direct effect (e.g., 
  Hansen et al., 1997; Schult et al., 1997; Haywood and Ramaswamy, 1998; Myhre 
  et al., 1998; Penner et al., 1998b). <br>
</p>
<p> Given their importance, measurements of black carbon, and the differentiation 
  between black and organic carbon, still require improvement (Heintzenberg et 
  al., 1997). Thermal methods measure the amount of carbon evolved from a filter 
  sample as a function of temperature. Care must be taken to avoid errors due 
  to pyrolysis of organics and interference from other species in the aerosol 
  (Reid et al., 1998a; Martins et al., 1998). Other black carbon measurements 
  use the light absorption of aerosol on a filter measured either in transmission 
  or reflection. However, calibrations for converting the change in absorption 
  to black carbon are not universally applicable (Liousse et al., 1993). In part 
  because of these issues, considerable uncertainties persist regarding the source 
  strengths of light-absorbing aerosols (Bond et al., 1998).<br>
</p>
<p>Carbonaceous aerosols from fossil fuel and biomass combustion<br>
  The main sources for carbonaceous aerosols are biomass and fossil fuel burning, 
  and the atmospheric oxidation of biogenic and anthropogenic volatile organic 
  compounds (VOC). In this section, we discuss that fraction of the carbonaceous 
  aerosol which originates from biomass or fossil fuel combustion and is present 
  predominantly in the sub-micron size fraction (Echalar et al., 1998; Cooke, 
  et al., 1999). The global emission of organic aerosol from biomass and fossil 
  fuel burning has been estimated at 45 to 80 and 10 to 30 Tg/yr, respectively 
  (Liousse, et al., 1996; Cooke, et al., 1999; Scholes and Andreae, 2000). Combustion 
  processes are the dominant source for black carbon; recent estimates place the 
  global emissions from biomass burning at 6 to 9 Tg/yr and from fossil fuel burning 
  at 6 to 8 Tg/yr (Penner et al., 1993; Cooke and Wilson, 1996; Liousse et al., 
  1996; Cooke et al., 1999, Scholes and Andreae, 2000; see <a href="168.htm#tab53">Table 
  5.3</a>). A recent study by Bond et al. (1998), in which a different technique 
  for the determination of black carbon emissions was used, suggests significantly 
  lower emissions. Not enough measurements are available at the present time, 
  however, to provide an independent estimate based on this technique. The source 
  distributions are shown in <a href="168.htm#fig52">Figures 5.2(c)</a> and<a href="168.htm#fig52"> 
  5.2(e)</a> for organic and black carbon, respectively. </p>
