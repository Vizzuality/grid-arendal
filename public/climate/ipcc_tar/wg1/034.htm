<h2>F.9 Projections of Future Changes in Sea Level</h2>

      <b>Figure 24:</b> Global average sea level rise 1990 to 2100 for the SRES 
      scenarios. Thermal expansion and land ice changes were calculated using 
      a simple climate model calibrated separately for each of seven AOGCMs, and 
      contributions from changes in permafrost, the effect of sediment deposition 
      and the long-term adjustment of the ice sheets to past climate change were 
      added. Each of the six lines appearing in the key is the average of AOGCMs 
      for one of the six illustrative scenarios. The region in dark shading shows 
      the range of the average of AOGCMs for all thirty five SRES scenarios. The 
      region in light shading shows the range of all AOGCMs for all thirty five 
      scenarios. The region delimited by the outermost lines shows the range of 
      all AOGCMs and scenarios including uncertainty in land-ice changes, permafrost 
      changes and sediment deposition. Note that this range does not allow for 
      uncertainty relating to ice-dynamic changes in the West Antarctic ice sheet.

<i>Projections of global average sea level rise from 1990 to 2100, using a range 
of AOGCMs following the IS92a scenario (including the direct effect of sulphate 
aerosol emissions), lie in the range 0.11 to 0.77 m.</i> This range reflects the systematic 
uncertainty of modelling. The main contributions to this sea level rise are: 
<ul>
  <li>a thermal expansion of 0.11 to 0.43 m, accelerating through the 21st century;<br>
  <li>a glacier contribution of 0.01 to 0.23 m; <br>
  <li>a Greenland contribution of -0.02 to 0.09 m; and<br>
  <li>an Antarctic contribution of -0.17 to +0.02 m.<br>
</ul>
<p>Also included in the computation of the total change are smaller contributions 
  from thawing of permafrost, deposition of sediment, and the ongoing contributions 
  from ice sheets as a result of climate change since the Last Glacial Maximum. 
  To establish the range of sea level rise resulting from the choice of different 
  SRES scenarios, results for thermal expansion and land-ice change from simple 
  models tuned to several AOGCMs are used (as in <a href="031.htm#f3">Section F.3</a> for temperature).</p>
<p><i>For the full set of SRES scenarios, a sea level rise of 0.09 to 0.88 m is 
  projected for 1990 to 2100 (see <a href="#figTechSum24">Figure 24</a>), primarily 
  from thermal expansion and loss of mass from glaciers and ice caps.</i> The 
  central value is 0.48 m, which corresponds to an average rate of about two to 
  four times the rate over the 20th century. The range of sea level rise presented 
  in the SAR was 0.13 to 0.94 m based on the IS92 scenarios. Despite higher temperature 
  change projections in this assessment, the sea level projections are slightly 
  lower, primarily due to the use of improved models which give a smaller contribution 
  from glaciers and ice sheets. If terrestrial storage continues at its current 
  rates, the projections could be changed by -0.21 to 0.11 m. For an average 
  of the AOGCMs, the SRES scenarios give results that differ by 0.02 m or less 
  for the first half of the 21st century. By 2100, they vary over a range amounting 
  to about 50% of the central value. Beyond the 21st century, sea level rise depends 
  strongly on the emissions scenario.</p>
<p>Models agree on the qualitative conclusion that the range of regional variation 
  in sea level change is substantial compared to global average sea level rise. 
  However, confidence in the regional distribution of sea level change from AOGCMs 
  is low because there is little similarity between models, although nearly all 
  models project greater than average rise in the Arctic Ocean and less than average 
  rise in the Southern Ocean. Further, land movements, both isostatic and tectonic, 
  will continue through the 21st century at rates that are unaffected by climate 
  change. It can be expected that by 2100, many regions currently experiencing 
  relative sea level fall will instead have a rising relative sea level. Lastly, 
  extreme high water levels will occur with increasing frequency as a result of 
  mean sea level rise. Their frequency may be further increased if storms become 
  more frequent or severe as a result of climate change.</p>
