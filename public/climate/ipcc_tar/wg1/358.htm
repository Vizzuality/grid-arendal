</table>
<p><a name="fig923"></a>As mentioned earlier, the basis of the experiments discussed 
  in the SAR is a transient increase of greenhouse gases throughout the integration. 
  In the model integrations presented in this section, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  increases up to a certain value (e.g., a doubling of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration) 
  and then remains constant for the remainder of the integration. Since this type 
  of integration involves integrating the model for very long time periods (at 
  least several centuries) only a few integrations have been performed using AOGCMs. 
  Furthermore, no standard emission scenarios have been used for forcing these 
  model runs and most have used idealised stabilisation values (2xCO<sub>2</sub> 
  or 3xCO<sub>2</sub> or 4xCO<sub>2</sub> for example). Again, in these integrations, 
  the CO<sub>2</sub> changes represent the radiative forcing changes of all the 
  greenhouse gases. Results from the models of intermediate complexity are used 
  to help understand the coupled model results, or in some cases, to explore areas 
  where AOGCM integrations do not exist. Experiments where the coupled system 
  is allowed time to reach equilibrium with the radiative forcing clearly show 
  the response times of its various components.</p>
<p>Even after the radiative forcing becomes constant, the surface air temperature 
  continues to increase for many centuries (<a href="355.htm#fig919">Figure 9.19</a>) 
  as noted in <a href="355.htm#9341">Section 9.3.4.1</a>. The rate of warming 
  after stabilisation is relatively small (&lt;0.3&deg;C per century, <a href="355.htm#fig919">Figure 
  9.19b</a>); however, the total warming after the radiative forcing stabilises 
  can be significant (more than 1&deg;C) because the warming continues for a long 
  time period (<a href="355.htm#fig919">Figure 9.19b</a>). From <a href="355.htm#fig919">Figure 
  9.19</a>, one notes that the rate of warming after stabilisation varies from 
  model to model. </p>
<p>The slow rate of surface air temperature increase occurs as the heat anomaly 
  slowly penetrates to depth in the ocean (<a href="#fig923">Figure 9.23</a>). 
  The rate of penetration is dependent on the model's vertical mixing both 
  resolved by the model's grid and by the sub-grid scale parametrizations. 
  The effect of the oceanic mixing parametrizations on the coupled model response 
  has been investigated using climate models of intermediate complexity (<a href="#fig924">Figure 
  9.24</a>): CLIMBER - Ganopolski et al. (2001); Bern 2.5_gm, Bern 2.5_hor - Stocker 
  et al. (1992); Uvic - Fanning and Weaver (1996), Weaver et al. (1998), Wiebe 
  and Weaver (2000); Bern_25, Bern_37 - Siegenthaler and Joos (1992), Joos et 
  al. (1996). The effect on the response of the global mean surface air temperature, 
  thermal expansion (see <a href="408.htm">Chapter 11</a>, <a href="434.htm#11541">Section 
  11.5.4.1</a> for a more complete discussion) and THC can be seen by comparing 
  the results obtained from Stocker's (Bern 2.5) models and the Uvic models 
  (Weaver and Wiebe, 1999). The sub-grid scale mixing para-metrizations vary in 
  the AOGCMs, accounting for much of the difference in the rate of surface warming 
  (as seen in <a href="355.htm#fig919">Figure 9.19b</a>). </p>
<p>The thermohaline circulation (THC) response is more complex than that of the 
  surface air temperature in the stablisation integrations (compare <a href="355.htm#fig919">Figure 
  9.19a</a> with <a href="#fig925">Figure 9.25</a>, for example). Typically the 
  THC weakens as the radiative forcing increases (<a href="357.htm">Section 9.3.4.3</a>). 
  After the radiative forcing stabilises, the THC recovers to its control integration 
  value. The initial weakening is caused by the warming of the mixed layer in 
  the ocean and the increase in the freshwater flux in high latitudes. As the 
  radiative forcing stablises, the tendency for the surface fluxes to weaken the 
  THC is balanced by the changes in the ocean heat and water transports and vertical 
  structure. It is found that the time-scale for this recovery varies from model 
  to model (about a century to multi-centuries). Again it is likely that differences 
  in the oceanic mixing are the cause for the differences in the recovery time. 
</p>
<p>The time rate of change in the radiative forcing also affects both the weakening 
  and recovery of the THC (<a href="#fig925">Figure 9.25</a>). In the GFDL_R15_a 
  model when the CO<sub>2</sub> increased at a rate of 1%/yr to doubling, the 
  THC continued to weaken for 70 years after the point at which the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  was held constant at the doubled value (year 70). In a second integration, the 
  CO<sub>2</sub> increased at a rate of 0.25%/yr to doubling. In this integration, 
  the THC does not weaken after the doubling point (Manabe and Stouffer, 1994), 
  indicating that the behaviour of the THC response is highly dependent on the 
  rate that the radiative forcing changes (<a href="#fig925">Figure 9.25</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that the transient THC response (i.e., the 
  weakening) is quite different from the equilibrium response of the THC (i.e., 
  little change). This fact makes the interpretation of comparisons between palaeo-proxy 
  data and coupled model results presented here difficult, since one needs to 
  know the details of the changes in the radiative forcing and resolve relatively 
  small time-scales in the proxy record.</p>
