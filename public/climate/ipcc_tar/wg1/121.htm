<h3>3.7.3 Coupled Model Responses and Implications for Future CO<sub>2</sub> Concentrations 
</h3>
<p>Carbon cycle models have indicated the potential for climate change to influence 
  the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by both land (<a href="119.htm#371">Section 
  3.7.1</a>) and oceans (<a href="120.htm">Section 3.7.2</a>) and thereby influence 
  the time course of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration for any given emissions 
  scenario. Coupled models are required to quantify these effects.</p>
<p>Two general circulation model simulations have included interactive land and 
  ocean carbon cycle components (Cox et al., 2000; Friedlingstein et al., 2001). 
  The Cox et al. (2000) model was driven by CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the 
  IS92a scenario (Legget et al., 1992) and the Friedlingstein et al. (2001) model 
  was driven by CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the SRES A2 scenario (IPCC, 2000b). 
  Both simulations indicate a positive feedback, i.e., both CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  and climate change at the end of the 21st century are increased due to the coupling. 
  The simulated magnitudes of the effect differ (+70 ppm, Friedlingstein et al., 
  2001; +270 ppm, Cox et al., 2000). In the Cox et al. (2000) simulation, which 
  included a DGVM, the increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is caused mainly by 
  loss of soil carbon and in part by tropical forest die back. The magnitude of 
  the climate-carbon cycle feedback still has large uncertainties associated with 
  the response of the terrestrial biosphere to climate change, especially the 
  response of heterotrophic respiration and tropical forest NPP to temperature 
  (Cox et al., 2000; see Sections <a href="101.htm">3.2.2.3</a> and <a href="119.htm#371">3.7.1</a>). 
  In the following section, simplified models are used to assess these uncertainties.</p>
<h4><a name="3731"></a>3.7.3.1 Methods for assessing the response of atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> to different emissions pathways and model sensitivities</h4>
<p>This section follows the approach of previous IPCC reports in using simplified, 
  fast models (sometimes known as reduced-form models) to assess the relationship 
  between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and concentrations, under various assumptions 
  about their future time course. Results are shown from two models, whose salient 
  features are summarised in <a href="122.htm#box37">Box 3.7</a>. The models lend 
  themselves to somewhat different approaches to estimating uncertainties. In 
  the ISAM model, "high-CO<sub>2</sub>" and "low-CO<sub>2</sub>" 
  alternatives are calculated for every emissions scenario, based on tuning the 
  model to match the range of responses included in the model intercomparisons 
  shown in <a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 3.10</a>. Uncertainties cited from 
  the ISAM model can be regarded as providing a lower bound on uncertainty since 
  they do not admit possible behaviours outside the range considered in recent 
  modelling studies. In the Bern-CC model, "high-CO<sub>2</sub>" and 
  "low-CO<sub>2</sub>" alternatives are calculated by making bounding 
  assumptions about carbon cycle processes (for example, in the high-CO<sub>2</sub> 
  parametrization CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation is capped at year 2000; in the 
  low-CO<sub>2</sub> parametrization Rh does not increase with warming). This 
  approach yields generally larger ranges of projected CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  than the ISAM approach. The ranges cited from the Bern-CC model can be regarded 
  as approaching an upper bound on uncertainty, since the true system response 
  is likely to be less extreme than the bounding assumptions, and because the 
  combination of "best" and "worst" case assumptions for every 
  process is intrinsically unlikely.</p>
