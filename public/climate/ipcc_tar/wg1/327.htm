<p><a name="fig817"></a>Barnett (1999) concatenated the annual mean near-surface 
  temperature anomaly fields from the first 100 years of integration of eleven 
  CMIP control experiments to produce common empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) 
  for the eleven AOGCMs. By projecting the Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature 
  (GISST) annual mean temperature anomaly data set (Rayner et al. 1996) onto these 
  common EOFs, he was able to estimate to what extent model variability represented 
  the observed variability. An analysis of the partial eigenvalue spectrum for 
  the different models (<a href="#fig817">Figure 8.17a</a>) suggests that there 
  is considerable disparity between the estimates of variability within the coupled 
  models. Some of this disparity arises from model drift and other low-frequency 
  variability. Intra-model disparity was much lower than inter-model disparity 
  as demonstrated by a similar common EOF analysis obtained from ten 100 year 
  segments in the 1,000 year GFDL_R15_a control run (<a href="#fig817">Figure 
  8.17b</a>). While the highest two modes were substantially underestimated in 
  the GFDL_R15_a model, the higher modes agreed better with observations. Error 
  bars on the observational data are large and when this is taken into account, 
  model disagreement with observations may not be significant. As Barnett (1999) 
  did not remove the trend over the 20th century in the GISST data set, the observations 
  also contain responses to both natural and anthropogenic forcing. One would 
  therefore expect control integrations from coupled climate models to underestimate 
  the observed spectrum at low frequencies (e.g., Folland et al., 1999).</p>
<p>An analogous study by Stouffer et al. (2000) compared the surface air temperature 
  variability from three long 1,000-year CMIP integrations (GFDL_R15_a, HadCM2, 
  ECHAM3/LSG (Large-Scale Geostrophic ocean model)) to the variability found in 
  the same observational data set (Jones and Briffa, 1992; Jones 1994). They argued 
  that, over the instrumental period, the simulated variability on annual to decadal 
  time-scales was fairly realistic both in terms of the geographical distribution 
  and the global mean values with a notable exception of the poor simulation of 
  observed tropical Pacific variability (<a href="#fig818">Figure 8.18</a>). The 
  HadCM2 model substantially overestimated tropical Pacific variability, whereas 
  it was underestimated in the GFDL_R15_a and ECHAM3/LSG models. They also noticed 
  that on the inter-decadal time-scale, the greatest variance in the models was 
  generally located near sea-ice margins close to regions of deep oceanic convection 
  and associated with low-frequency variations of the thermohaline circulation. 
  While the three models generally agreed on the dominant modes of variability, 
  there was substantial inter-model disparity in the magnitude of each mode. The 
  analysis of Stouffer et al. (2000) can easily be reconciled with Barnett (1999) 
  by realising that Stouffer et al. (2000) examined a subset (GFDL_R15_a, HadCM2, 
  ECHAM3/LSG models) of those CMIP models considered by Barnett (1999) that did 
  not experience climate drift, and that less emphasis was placed on the poor 
  resolution of tropical Pacific variability.</p>
<p>As an extension to the above analysis, Bell et al. (2000) compared annual mean 
  surface air temperature variability in sixteen CMIP control simulations to the 
  thermometer record, on time-scales of 1 year to 40 years (<a href="#fig819">Figure 
  8.19</a>). The authors found that: (1) thirteen of the sixteen CMIP models underestimate 
  variability in surface air temperatures over the global oceans; (2) twelve of 
  the sixteen models overestimate variability over land; (3) all the models overestimate 
  the ratio of air temperature variability over land to variability over oceans. 
  These results likely reflect problems in both the ocean and land-surface components 
  of climate models. In particular, underestimation of variability over oceans 
  may be due, at least in part, to weak or absent representations of El Ni&ntilde;o 
  in the models; overestimation of variability over land may be due to poor land 
  surface parametrizations including insufficient soil moisture.</p>
<p>Duffy et al. (2000) also partitioned the CMIP models into those that are flux 
  adjusted and those that are not. They defined two measures of temperature variability 
  and applied them to the CMIP control simulations. The simulations differed substantially 
  in the amount of temperature variability they showed. However, on time-scales 
  of 1 year to 20 years, the flux adjusted simulations did not have significantly 
  less variability than the non-flux adjusted simulations; there is some suggestion 
  that they may have more variability. Thus it cannot be argued, for example, 
  that the use of flux adjusted models in studies of detection of anthropogenic 
  climate change tends to make observed temperature changes seem more significant 
  than they should be, compared to natural internal climate variability. Nevertheless, 
  it is still an open question as to how coupled model variability depends on 
  internal model parameters and resolution.</p>

<h4><a name="8622"></a>8.6.2.2 Comparison with palaeo-data</h4>
<p>There have been relatively few studies which have undertaken a systematic comparison 
  of AOGCM variability with variability found in the Holocene proxy temperature 
  record. However, three studies (from the MPI (Max Planck Institute), Hadley 
  Centre and GFDL) that focus on the analysis of long control integrations are 
  available. Barnett et al. (1996) demonstrated that the GFDL_R15_a (Stouffer 
  et al., 1994) and ECHAM1/LSG (Cubasch et al., 1994) models underestimate the 
  levels of decadal-scale variability in summer palaeo-temperature proxies from 
  1600 to 1950 (expanded version of Bradley and Jones, 1993), with increasing 
  disparity with observations at lower frequencies.</p>
<p>Using annual and decadal mean near-surface palaeo-temperature reconstructions 
  at seventeen locations Jones et al. (1998) demonstrated, through a principal 
  component analysis, that the standard deviation of the GFDL_R15_a model (Stouffer 
  et al., 1994) and the HadCM2 model (Johns et al., 1997; Tett et al., 1997) principal 
  component time-series compared favourably with both proxy and observed data. 
  Time-series of the top seven principal components did, however, show much less 
  century time-scale variability than in the proxy time-series. This was especially 
  true in the HadCM2 model that was dominated by tropic-wide decadal variability. 
  Through cross-spectral analysis they concluded that the "GFDL control integration 
  bears a remarkable similarity in its statistical properties to that obtained 
  from the proxy data. In view of this similarity it appears the spatial structures 
  from the control integration can be used to represent the spatial structures 
  of naturally occurring variations in near-surface air temperature". This 
  conclusion was also highlighted by Delworth and Mann (2000) who noted that both 
  palaeo-temperature reconstructions (Mann et al., 1998) and the GFDL_R15_a coupled 
  model suggest a distinct oscillatory mode of climate variability (with an approximate 
  time-scale of about 70 years) of hemispheric scale and centred around the North 
  Atlantic.</p>
