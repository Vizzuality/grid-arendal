<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p><i>Remaining uncertainties</i><br>
  A number of important uncertainties remain. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Discrepancies between the vertical profile of temperature change in the 
    troposphere seen in observations and models. These have been reduced as more 
    realistic forcing histories have been used in models, although not fully resolved. 
    Also, the difference between observed surface and lower-tropospheric trends 
    over the last two decades cannot be fully reproduced by model simulations.</li>
  <li>Large uncertainties in estimates of internal climate variability from models 
    and observations, though as noted above, these are unlikely (bordering on 
    very unlikely) to be large enough to nullify the claim that a detectable climate 
    change has taken place. </li>
  <li>Considerable uncertainty in the reconstructions of solar and volcanic forcing 
    which are based on proxy or limited observational data for all but the last 
    two decades. Detection of the influence of greenhouse gases on climate appears 
    to be robust to possible amplification of the solar forcing by ozone/solar 
    or solar/cloud interactions, provided these do not alter the pattern or time 
    dependence of the response to solar forcing. Amplification of the solar signal 
    by these processes, which are not yet included in models, remains speculative. 
  </li>
  <li>Large uncertainties in anthropogenic forcing are associated with the effects 
    of aerosols. The effects of some anthropogenic factors, including organic 
    carbon, black carbon, biomass aerosols, and changes in land use, have not 
    been included in detection and attribution studies. Estimates of the size 
    and geographic pattern of the effects of these forcings vary considerably, 
    although individually their global effects are estimated to be relatively 
    small.</li>
  <li>Large differences in the response of different models to the same forcing. 
    These differences, which are often greater than the difference in response 
    in the same model with and without aerosol effects, highlight the large uncertainties 
    in climate change prediction and the need to quantify uncertainty and reduce 
    it through better observational data sets and model improvement. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Synopsis</i><br>
  The SAR concluded: "The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human 
  influence on global climate". That report also noted that the anthropogenic 
  signal was still emerging from the background of natural climate variability. 
  Since the SAR, progress has been made in reducing uncertainty, particularly 
  with respect to distinguishing and quantifying the magnitude of responses to 
  different external influences. Although many of the sources of uncertainty identified 
  in the SAR still remain to some degree, new evidence and improved understanding 
  support an updated conclusion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a longer and more closely scrutinised temperature record and new 
    model estimates of variability. The warming over the past 100 years is very 
    unlikely to be due to internal variability alone, as estimated by current 
    models. Reconstructions of climate data for the past 1,000 years also indicate 
    that this warming was unusual and is unlikely to be entirely natural in origin. 
  </li>
  <li>There are new estimates of the climate response to natural and anthropogenic 
    forcing, and new detection techniques have been applied. Detection and attribution 
    studies consistently find evidence for an anthropogenic signal in the climate 
    record of the last 35 to 50 years. </li>
  <li>Simulations of the response to natural forcings alone (i.e., the response 
    to variability in solar irradiance and volcanic eruptions) do not explain 
    the warming in the second half of the 20th century. However, they indicate 
    that natural forcings may have contributed to the observed warming in the 
    first half of the 20th century. </li>
  <li>The warming over the last 50 years due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases 
    can be identified despite uncertainties in forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate 
    aerosol and natural factors (volcanoes and solar irradiance). The anthropogenic 
    sulphate aerosol forcing, while uncertain, is negative over this period and 
    therefore cannot explain the warming. Changes in natural forcing during most 
    of this period are also estimated to be negative and are unlikely to explain 
    the warming.</li>
  <li>Detection and attribution studies comparing model simulated changes with 
    the observed record can now take into account uncertainty in the magnitude 
    of modelled response to external forcing, in particular that due to uncertainty 
    in climate sensitivity.</li>
  <li>Most of these studies find that, over the last 50 years, the estimated rate 
    and magnitude of warming due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases 
    alone are comparable with, or larger than, the observed warming. Furthermore, 
    most model estimates that take into account both greenhouse gases and sulphate 
    aerosols are consistent with observations over this period.</li>
  <li>The best agreement between model simulations and observations over the last 
    140 years has been found when all the above anthropogenic and natural forcing 
    factors are combined. These results show that the forcings included are sufficient 
    to explain the observed changes, but do not exclude the possibility that other 
    forcings may also have contributed.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the light of new evidence and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, 
  most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due 
  to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is very likely that the 20th century warming has contributed 
  significantly to the observed sea level rise, through thermal expansion of sea 
  water and widespread loss of land ice. Within present uncertainties, observations 
  and models are both consistent with a lack of significant acceleration of sea 
  level rise during the 20th century.</p>
