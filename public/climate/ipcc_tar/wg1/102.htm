<h4>3.2.2.4 Effects of increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub></h4>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> compete for the reaction sites on the photosynthetic carbon-fixing 
  enzyme, Rubisco. Increasing the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere has two 
  effects on the Rubisco reactions: increasing the rate of reaction with CO<sub>2</sub> (carboxylation) 
  and decreasing the rate of oxygenation. Both effects increase the rate of photosynthesis, 
  since oxygenation is followed by photorespiration which releases CO<sub>2</sub> (Farquhar 
  et al., 1980). With increased photsynthesis, plants can develop faster, attaining 
  the same final size in less time, or can increase their final mass. In the first 
  case, the overall rate of litter production increases and so the soil carbon 
  stock increases; in the second case, both the below-ground and above-ground 
  carbon stocks increase. Both types of growth response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> have been 
  observed (Masle, 2000). </p>
<p>The strength of the response of photosynthesis to an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  depends on the photosynthetic pathway used by the plant. Plants with a photosynthetic 
  pathway known as C<sub>3</sub> (all trees, nearly all plants of cold climates, and most 
  agricultural crops including wheat and rice) generally show an increased rate 
  of photosynthesis in response to increases in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration above the present 
  level (Koch and Mooney, 1996; Curtis, 1996; Mooney et al., 1999). Plants with 
  the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway (tropical and many temperate grasses, some desert 
  shrubs, and some crops including maize and sugar cane) already have a mechanism 
  to concentrate CO<sub>2</sub> and therefore show either no direct photo-synthetic response, 
  or less response than C<sub>3</sub> plants (Wand et al., 1999). Increased CO<sub>2</sub> has also 
  been reported to reduce plant respiration under some conditions (Drake et al., 
  1999), although this effect has been questioned.</p>
<p>Increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration allows the partial closure of stomata, restricting 
  water loss during transpiration and producing an increase in the ratio of carbon 
  gain to water loss ("water-use efficiency", WUE) (Field et al., 1995a; 
  Drake et al., 1997; Farquhar, 1997; K&ouml;rner, 2000). This effect can lengthen 
  the duration of the growing season in seasonally dry ecosystems and can increase 
  NPP in both C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants.<br>
  <br>
  Nitrogen-use efficiency also generally improves as carbon input increases, because 
  plants can vary the ratio between carbon and nitrogen in tissues and require 
  lower concentrations of photosynthetic enzymes in order to carry out photosynthesis 
  at a given rate; for this reason, low nitrogen availability does not consistently 
  limit plant responses to increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (McGuire et al., 1995; Lloyd 
  and Farquhar, 1996; Curtis and Wang, 1998; Norby et al., 1999; K&ouml;rner, 
  2000). Increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration may also stimulate nitrogen fixation (Hungate 
  et al., 1999; Vitousek and Field, 1999). Changes in tissue nutrient concentration 
  may affect herbivory and decomposition, although long-term decomposition studies 
  have shown that the effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in this respect is likely to be small 
  (Norby and Cortufo, 1998) because changes in the C:N ratio of leaves are not 
  consistently reflected in the C:N ratio of leaf litter due to nitrogen retranslocation 
  (Norby et al., 1999). <br>
  <br>
  The process of CO<sub>2</sub> "fertilisation" thus involves direct effects on 
  carbon assimilation and indirect effects such as those via water saving and 
  interactions between the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Increasing CO<sub>2</sub> can therefore 
  lead to structural and physiological changes in plants (Pritchard et al., 1999) 
  and can further affect plant competition and distribution patterns due to responses 
  of different species. Field studies show that the relative stimulation of NPP 
  tends to be greater in low-productivity years, suggesting that improvements 
  in water- and nutrient-use efficiency can be more important than direct NPP 
  stimulation (Luo et al., 1999).<br>
  <br>
  Although NPP stimulation is not automatically reflected in increased plant biomass, 
  additional carbon is expected to enter the soil, via accelerated ontogeny, which 
  reduces lifespan and results in more rapid shoot death, or by enhanced root 
  turnover or exudation (Koch and Mooney, 1996; Allen et al., 2000). Because the 
  soil microbial community is generally limited by the availability of organic 
  substrates, enhanced addition of labile carbon to the soil tends to increase 
  heterotrophic respiration unless inhibited by other factors such as low temperature 
  (Hungate et al., 1997; Schlesinger and Andrews, 2000). Field studies have indicated 
  increases in soil organic matter, and increases in soil respiration of about 
  30%, under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (Schlesinger and Andrews, 2000). The potential role 
  of the soil as a carbon sink under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> is crucial to understanding 
  NEP and long-term carbon dynamics, but remains insufficiently well understood 
  (Trumbore, 2000). <br>
  <br>
  C<sub>3</sub> crops show an average increase in NPP of around 33% for a doubling of atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> (Koch and Mooney, 1996). Grassland and crop studies combined show an average 
  biomass increase of 14%, with a wide range of responses among individual studies 
  (Mooney et al., 1999). In cold climates, low temperatures restrict the photosynthetic 
  response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. In tropical grasslands and savannas, C<sub>4</sub> grasses are 
  dominant, so it has been assumed that trees and C<sub>3</sub> grasses would gain a competitive 
  advantage at high CO<sub>2</sub> (Gifford, 1992; Collatz et al., 1998). This is supported 
  by carbon isotope evidence from the last glacial maximum, which suggests that 
  low CO<sub>2</sub> favours C<sub>4</sub> plants (Street-Perrott et al., 1998). However, field experiments 
  suggest a more complex picture with C<sub>4</sub> plants sometimes doing better than C<sub>3</sub> 
  under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> due to improved WUE at the ecosystem level (Owensby et al., 
  1993; Polley et al., 1996). Highly productive forest ecosystems have the greatest 
  potential for absolute increases in productivity due to CO<sub>2</sub> effects. Long-term 
  field studies on young trees have typically shown a stimulation of photosynthesis 
  of about 60% for a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> (Saxe et al., 1998; Norby et al., 1999). 
  A FACE experiment in a fast growing young pine forest showed an increase of 
  25% in NPP for an increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> to 560 ppm (DeLucia et al., 1999). 
  Some of this additional NPP is allocated to root metabolism and associated microbes; 
  soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux increases, returning a part (but not all) of the extra NPP to 
  the atmosphere (Allen et al., 2000). The response of mature forests to increases 
  in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has not been shown experimentally; it may be 
  different from that of young forests for various reasons, including changes 
  in leaf C:N ratios and stomatal responses to water vapour deficits as trees 
  mature (Curtis and Wang, 1998; Norby et al., 1999). <br>
  <br>
  At high CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations there can be no further increase in photosynthesis 
  with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> (Farquhar et al., 1980), except through further stomatal 
  closure, which may produce continued increases in WUE in water-limited environments. 
  The shape of the response curve of global NPP at higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations than 
  present is uncertain because the response at the level of gas exchange is modified 
  by incompletely understood plant- and ecosystem-level processes (Luo et al., 
  1999). Based on photosynthetic physiology, it is likely that the additional 
  carbon that could be taken up globally by enhanced photosynthsis as a direct 
  consequence of rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is small at atmospheric 
  concentrations above 800 to 1,000 ppm. Experimental studies indicate that some 
  ecosystems show greatly reduced CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation at lower concentrations than 
  this (K&ouml;rner, 2000). </p>
