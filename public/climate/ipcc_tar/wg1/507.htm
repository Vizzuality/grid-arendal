<h4>14.2.3.1 Clouds</h4>
<p>The role of clouds in the climate system continues to challenge the modelling 
  of climate (e.g., <a href="271.htm">Chapter 7, Section 7.2.2</a>). It is generally 
  accepted that the net effect of clouds on the radiative balance of the planet 
  is negative and has an average magnitude of about 10 to 20 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. This balance 
  consists of a short-wave cooling (the albedo effect) of about 40 to 50 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  and a long-wave warming of about 30 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. Unfortunately, the size of the uncertainties 
  in this budget is large when compared to the expected anthropogenic greenhouse 
  forcing. Although we know that the overall net effect of clouds on the radiative 
  balance is slightly negative, we do not know the sign of cloud feedback with 
  respect to the increase of greenhouse gases, and it may vary with the region. 
  In fact, the basic issue of the nature of the future cloud feedback is not clear. 
  Will it remain negative? If the planet warms, then it is plausible that evaporation 
  will increase, which probably implies that liquid water content will increase 
  but the volume of clouds may not. What will be the effect and how will the effects 
  be distributed in time and space? Finally, the issue of cloud feedbacks is also 
  coupled to the very difficult issue of indirect aerosol forcing (see <a href="181.htm">Chapter 
  5, Section 5.3</a>).<br>
</p>
<p>The importance of clouds was summarised in the SAR: "The single largest uncertainty 
  in determining the climate sensitivity to either natural or anthropogenic changes 
  are clouds and their effects on radiation and their role in the hydrological 
  cycle" (Kattenberg et al., 1996, p.345). And yet, the single greatest source 
  of uncertainty in the estimates of the climate sensitivity continues to be clouds 
  (see also <a href="266.htm">Chapter 7, Section 7.2</a>). Since the SAR, there 
  have been a number of improvements in the simulation of both the cloud distribution 
  and in the radiative properties of clouds (<a href="271.htm">Chapter 7, Section 
  7.2.2</a>). The simulation of cloud distribution has improved as the overall 
  simulation of the atmospheric models has improved. In addition, the cloud sub-component 
  models used in the coupled models have become more realistic. Also, our understanding 
  of the radiative properties of clouds and their effects on climate sensitivity 
  have improved. And yet in <a href="271.htm">Chapter 7, Section 7.2.2</a> we 
  find that, "In spite of these improvements, there has been no apparent narrowing 
  of the uncertainty range associated with cloud feedbacks in current climate 
  change simulations."<br>
</p>
<p>Handling the physics and/or the parametrization of clouds in climate models 
  remains a central difficulty. There is a need for increased observations. J. 
  Mitchell highlighted the challenge in a recent paper at the World Climate Research 
  Programme (WCRP) Workshop on Cloud Properties and Cloud Feedbacks in Large-scale 
  Models where he stated that "Reducing the uncertainty in cloud-climate 
  feedbacks is one of the toughest challenges facing atmospheric physicists" 
  (Mitchell, 2000).<br>
</p>
<p>Cloud modelling is a particularly challenging scientific problem because it 
  involves processes covering a very wide range of space- and time-scales. For 
  example, cloud systems extending over thousands of kilometres to cloud droplets 
  and aerosols of microscopic size are all important components of the climate 
  system. The time-scales of interest can range from hundreds of years (e.g., 
  future equilibrium climates) to fractions of a second (e.g., droplet collisions). 
  This is not to say that all cloud micro-physics must be included in modelling 
  cloud formation and cloud properties, but the demarcation between what must 
  be included and what can be parametrized remains unclear. Clarifying this demarcation 
  and improving both the resulting phenomenological characterisations and parametrizations 
  will depend critically on improved global observations of clouds (see <a href="082.htm">Chapter 
  2, Section 2.5.5</a>; see also Senior, 1999). Of particular importance are observations 
  of cloud structure and distribution against natural patterns of climate variability 
  (e.g., ENSO). Complementing the broad climatologies will be important observations 
  of cloud ice-water and liquid-water content, radiative heating and optical depth 
  profiles, and precipitation occurrence and cloud geometry.<br>
</p>
<p>The recently approved CloudSat and PICASSO missions, which will fly in formation 
  with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (USA) (NASA) Earth Observing 
  System (EOS) PM (the Aqua Mission), will provide valuable profiles of cloud 
  ice and liquid content, optical depth, cloud type, and aerosol properties. These 
  observations, combined with wider swath radiometric data from EOS PM sensors, 
  will provide a rich new source of information about the properties of clouds 
  (Stephens et al., 2000).<br>
</p>
<p>And yet, this question of cloud feedback remains open, and it is not clear 
  how it will be answered. Given that the current generation of global climate 
  models represents the Earth in terms of grid-points spaced roughly 200 km apart, 
  many features observed on smaller scales, such as individual cloud systems and 
  cloud geometry, are not explicitly resolved. Without question, the strategy 
  for attacking the feedback question will involve comparison of model simulations 
  with appropriate observations on global or local scales. The interplay of observation 
  and models, again, will be the key for progress. Mitchell (Mitchell, 2000) states 
  this clearly, "Unless there are stronger links between those making observations 
  and those using climate models, then there is little chance of a reduction in 
  the uncertainty in cloud feedback in the next twenty years." This is echoed 
  in this report (see <a href="271.htm">Chapter 7, Section 7.2.2</a>), "A straightforward 
  approach of model validation is not sufficient to constrain efficiently the 
  models and a more dedicated approach is needed. It should be favoured by a larger 
  availability of satellite measurements."</p>
