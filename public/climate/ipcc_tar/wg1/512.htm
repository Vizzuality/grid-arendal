<h3>14.2.5 Precipitation, Soil Moisture, and River Flow: Elements of the Hydrological 
  Cycle</h3>
<p>Changes in precipitation could have significant impacts on society. Precipitation 
  is an essential element in determining the availability of drinking water and 
  the level of soil moisture. Improved treatment of precipitation (see <a href="276.htm">Chapter 
  7, Section 7.2.3</a>) is an essential step.<br>
  <br>
  Soil moisture is a key component in the land surface schemes in climate models, 
  since it is closely related to evapotranspiration and thus to the apportioning 
  of sensible and latent heat fluxes. It is primary in the formation of runoff 
  and hence river-flow. Further, soil moisture is an important determinant of 
  ecosystem structure and therein a primary means by which climate regulates (and 
  is partially regulated by) ecosystem distribution. Soil moisture is an important 
  regulator of plant productivity and sustainability of natural ecosystems. In 
  turn terrestrial ecosystems recycle water vapour at the land-surface/atmosphere 
  boundary, exchange numerous important trace gases with the atmosphere, and transfer 
  water and biogeochemical compounds to river systems (see also the discussion 
  in <a href="292.htm">Chapter 7, Section 7.4.3</a> and <a href="322.htm">Chapter 
  8, Section 8.5.4</a>). New efforts are needed in the development of models, 
  which successfully represent the space-time dynamics interaction between soil, 
  climate and vegetation. If water is a central controlling aspect, then the interaction 
  necessarily passes all the way through the space-time dynamics of soil moisture. 
  Finally, adequate soil moisture is an essential resource for human activity. 
  Consequently, accurate prediction of soil moisture is crucial for simulation 
  of the hydrological cycle, of soil and vegetation biochemistry, including the 
  cycling of carbon and nutrients, and of ecosystem structure and distribution 
  as well as climate. <br>
</p>
<p>River systems are linked to regional and continental-scale hydrology through 
  interactions among precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil water, and runoff 
  in terrestrial ecosystems. River systems, and more generally the entire global 
  water cycle, control the movement of constituents over vast distances, from 
  the continental land-masses to the world's oceans and to the atmosphere. 
  Rivers are also central features of human settlement and development. <br>
</p>
<p>It appears, however, that a significant level of variance exists among land 
  models, associated with unresolved differences among parametrization details 
  (particularly difficulties in the modelling of soil hydrology) and parameter 
  sets. In fact, many of the changes in land-surface models since the SAR fall 
  within this range of model diversity. It is not known to what extent these differences 
  in land-surface response translate into differences in global climate sensitivity 
  (see <a href="323.htm">Chapter 8, Section 8.5.4.3</a>) although the uncertainty 
  associated with the land-surface response must be smaller than the uncertainty 
  associated with clouds (Lofgren, 1995). There is model-based evidence indicating 
  that these differences in the land-surface response may be significant for the 
  simulation of the local land-surface climate and regional atmospheric climate 
  changes (see <a href="289.htm">Chapter 7, Section 7.4</a>). </p>
<p>Much attention in the land-surface modelling community has been directed toward 
  the diversity of parametrizations of water and energy fluxes (see <a href="289.htm">Chapter 
  7, Sections 7.4</a>, <a href="293.htm">7.5</a>, and <a href="316.htm">Chapter 
  8, Section 8.5</a>). Intercomparison experiments (see <a href="322.htm">Chapter 
  8, Section 8.5.4</a>) have quantified the inter-model differences in response 
  to prescribed atmospheric forcing, and have demonstrated that the most significant 
  outliers can be understood in terms of unrealistic physical approximations in 
  their formulation, particularly the neglect of stomatal resistance. Some coupled 
  models now employ some form of stomatal resistance to evaporation. <br>
</p>
<p>Climate-induced changes in vegetation have potentially large climatic implications, 
  but are still generally neglected in the coupled-model experiments used to estimate 
  future changes in climate (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>).<br>
</p>
<p>There is, obviously, a direct coupling between predicted soil moisture and 
  predicted river flows and the availability of water for human use. Complex patterns 
  of locally generated runoff are transformed into horizontal transport as rivers 
  through the drainage basin. Moreover, any global perspective on surface hydrology 
  must explicitly recognise the impact of human intervention in the water cycle, 
  not only through climate and land-use change, but also through the operation 
  of impoundments, inter-basin transfers, and consumptive use. <br>
</p>
<p>Recognition of the importance of land hydrology for the salinity distribution 
  of the oceans is one reason for seeking improvements in models for routing runoff 
  to the oceans (see more precise cites here and in <a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>). Most coupled models now return land runoff to the ocean as fresh water 
  (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>). Runoff is collected over geographically 
  realistic river basins and mixed into the ocean at the appropriate river mouths. 
  Although this routing is performed instantaneously in some models, the trend 
  is toward model representation of the significant time-lag (order of a month) 
  in runoff production to river-ocean discharge. What is needed for a variety 
  of reasons, however, is for river flow itself to be treated in models of the 
  climate system. (See <a href="292.htm">Chapter 7, Section 7.4.3</a>.)<br>
</p>
<p>On land, surface processes have until very recently been treated summarily 
  in Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs). The focus of evaluating AGCMs 
  has been on large-scale dynamics and certain meteorological variables; far less 
  so on the partitioning of sensible and latent heat flux, or the moisture content 
  of the planetary boundary layer. When the goals of climate modelling are expanded 
  to include terrestrial biosphere function, such aspects become of central importance 
  as regulators of the interaction between the carbon and water cycles. Terrestrial 
  flux and boundary-layer measurements represent a new, expanding and potentially 
  hugely important resource for improving our understanding of these processes 
  and their representation in models of the climate system. (See <a href="289.htm#741">Chapter 
  7, Section 7.4.1</a>.)<br>
</p>
<p>The spatial resolution of current global climate models, roughly 200 km, is 
  too coarse to simulate the impact of global change on most individual river 
  basins. To verify the transport models will require budgets of water and other 
  biogeochemical constituents for large basins of the world. This requires ground-based 
  meteorology in tandem with remotely sensed data for a series of variables, including 
  information on precipitation, soils, land cover, surface radiation, status of 
  the vegetative canopy, topography, floodplain extent, and inundation. Model 
  results can be constrained by using a database of observed discharge and constituent 
  fluxes at key locations within the drainage basins analysed. Climate time-series 
  and monthly discharge data for the past several decades at selected locations 
  provide the opportunity for important tests of models, including appraisal of 
  the impact of episodic events, such as El Ni&ntilde;o, on surface water balance 
  and river discharge. It will be necessary to inventory, document, and make available 
  such data sets to identify gaps in our knowledge, and where it is necessary 
  to collect additional data. Even in the best-represented regions of the globe 
  coherent time-series are available for only the last 30 years or less. This 
  lack of data constrains our ability to construct and test riverine flux models. 
  Standardised protocols, in terms of sampling frequency, spatial distribution 
  of sampling networks, and chemical analyses are needed to ensure the production 
  of comparable data sets in disparate parts of the globe. Upgrades of the basic 
  monitoring system for discharge and riverborne constituents at the large scale 
  are therefore required.<br>
</p>
<p>In sum, hydrological processes and energy exchange, especially those involving 
  clouds, surface exchanges, and interactions of these with radiation are crucial 
  for further progress in modelling the atmosphere. Feedbacks with land require 
  careful attention to the treatments of evapotranspiration, soil moisture storage, 
  and runoff. All of these occur on spatial scales which are fine compared with 
  the model meshes, so the question of scaling must be addressed. These improvements 
  must be paralleled by the acquisition of global data sets for validation of 
  these treatments. Validation of models against global and regional requirements 
  for conservation of energy is especially important in this regard. As noted 
  in <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a> (<a href="323.htm">Section 8.5.4.3</a>), 
  "Uncertainty in land surface processes, coupled with uncertainty in parameter 
  data combines, at this time, to limit the confidence we have in the simulated 
  regional impacts of increasing CO<sub>2</sub>."</p>
