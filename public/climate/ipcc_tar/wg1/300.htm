<h3>7.6.2 Ocean-atmosphere Interactions</h3>
<p>There is no clear separation between the wind-driven circulation and the THC 
  (see <a href="287.htm">Section 7.3.6</a>) because they interact with each other 
  on several time-scales. While there is a great deal of empirical evidence that 
  the ocean and sea surface temperatures co-vary with the atmosphere, this may 
  only indicate that the atmosphere forces the ocean, and it does not necessarily 
  signify a feedback or a truly coupled process that contributes to the variability. 
  Moreover, it is very difficult to establish such coupling from observational 
  studies. This topic was not dealt with thoroughly by the SAR. In the tropics 
  there is clear evidence of the ocean forcing the atmosphere, such as in El Ni&ntilde;o 
  (see <a href="303.htm">Section 7.6.5</a>). In the extra-tropics much of what 
  can be seen is accountable through fairly random wind variations; essentially 
  stochastic forcing of the ocean is converted into low frequency ocean variability 
  and gives a red spectrum in oceanic temperatures and currents up to the decadal 
  time-scale (Hasselmann, 1976; Hall and Manabe, 1997). Feedback to the atmosphere 
  is not involved. In the spatial resonance concept (Frankignoul and Reynolds, 
  1983) there is still no feedback from the ocean to the atmosphere, but oceanic 
  quantities may exhibit a spectral peak through an advective time-scale (Saravanan 
  and McWilliams, 1998) or Rossby wave dynamics time-scale (Weng and Neelin, 1998). 
  In coupled air-sea modes, such as those proposed by Latif and Barnett (1996) 
  for the North Pacific and by Groetzner et al. (1998) for the North Atlantic, 
  there is a feedback from the ocean to the atmosphere. Spectral peaks are found 
  in both the ocean and the atmosphere, and the period of the oscillation is basically 
  determined by the adjustment time of the sub-tropical gyre to changes in the 
  wind stress curl. </p>
<p> Coupled models indicate that, in mid-latitudes, the predominant process is 
  the atmosphere driving the ocean as seen by the surface fluxes and as observed, 
  yet when an atmospheric model is run with specified SSTs, the fluxes are reversed 
  in sign, showing the forcing of the atmosphere from the now infinite heat capacity 
  of the ocean (implied by specified SSTs). Recent ensemble results (Rodwell et 
  al., 1999; Mehta et al., 2000) have been able to reproduce the decadal North 
  Atlantic atmospheric variations from observed SSTs but with much reduced amplitude. 
  Bretherton and Battisti (2000) suggest that this is consistent with a predominant 
  stochastic driving of the ocean by the atmosphere with some modest feedback 
  on the atmosphere, and that the signal only emerges through ensemble averaging. 
</p>
<p> In the extra-tropics, a key question remains the sensitivity of the mid-latitude 
  atmosphere to surface forcing from sea ice and sea surface temperature anomalies. 
  Different modelling studies with similar surface conditions yield contradictory 
  results (e.g., Robertson et al., 2000a,b). The crude treatment of processes 
  involving sea ice, oceanic convection, internal ocean mixing and eddy-induced 
  transports and the coarse resolution of most coupled climate models, adds considerably 
  to the uncertainty.</p>
