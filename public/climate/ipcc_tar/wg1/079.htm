<h3>2.5.3 Water Vapour </h3>
<p>Although measurement problems hinder the analysis of long-term water vapour 
  changes (Elliott, 1995; Rind, 1998), several recent studies tend to confirm 
  and extend the findings of lower tropospheric water vapour increases reported 
  in the SAR. Furthermore, new analyses indicate upward trends in near-surface 
  humidity. Knowledge about changes in water vapour at upper tropospheric and 
  lower stratospheric levels is of great importance because strong alterations 
  in radiative forcing can result from small absolute changes in water vapour 
  at these levels (<a href="212.htm">Chapters 6</a> and <a href="260.htm">7</a>). 
  New data presented here from the SPARC WAVAS (Stratospheric Processes and their 
  Role in Climate / Water Vapour Assessment) project (Kley et al., 2000) are starting 
  to cast light on changes at these levels. Note that water vapour pressure, and 
  specific humidity (for a constant relative humidity) increase non-linearly with 
  increasing temperature.</p>
<h4><a name="2531"></a>2.5.3.1 Surface water vapour</h4>
<p>Water vapour pressure, dew-point or relative humidity at the surface is conventionally 
  measured using wet and dry bulb thermometers exposed in thermometer screens 
  at climate stations. The quality of these data has been little studied. Wet 
  bulb thermometers are not usually aspirated, so that the cooling of the wet 
  bulb, and therefore the deduced specific or relative humidity, depends on the 
  flow rate of air within the screen. This may often differ from the assumed airflow. 
  Occasionally wet bulbs may dry out. Thus it is not possible to judge fully the 
  accuracy of surface vapour pressure trends presented here.</p>
<p>Sch&ouml;nwiese et al. (1994) and Sch&ouml;nwiese and Rapp (1997) found small 
  increases in surface vapour pressure over most of Europe from 1961 to 1990. 
  The annual trends are weak. Statistically significant changes are confined to 
  increases of about 0.5 to 1.5 hPa (relative to mean values of 12 to 15 hPa) 
  in the southern and eastern Mediterranean region (with the largest increase 
  in summer) and decreases of about 0.5 hPa over parts of Turkey (mainly in springtime). 
</p>
<p>Specific humidity trends over the United States were overwhelmingly positive 
  for the period 1961 to 1995, with magnitudes of several per cent per decade, 
  and with the largest and most statistically significant trends in spring and 
  summer (Gaffen and Ross, 1999). Night-time specific humidity trends were generally 
  stronger than daytime trends. Relative humidity showed smaller increases, especially 
  in winter and spring. The specific humidity and derived dew point trends are 
  broadly consistent, both spatially and in their day-night differences, with 
  temperature trends. Schwartzman et al. (1998) found that the diurnal dewpoint 
  cycle is changing over North America, with a relative decline in late afternoon 
  and a small rise at midday.</p>

      dots have no data. Blue shaded areas have nominally significant increasing 
      trends and brown shaded areas have significant decreasing trends, both at

      so the level of significance may be overstated. From New et al. (2000).</td>

<p>Increases in water vapour over the former Soviet Union, Eastern China, the 
  United States and tropical Western Pacific islands have been found in some seasons 
  by Sun et al. (2000) in the second half of the 20th century, but with decreases 
  in Canada in autumn. The selective character of the findings prevents any assessment 
  of statistical significance. Wang and Gaffen (2001) found that specific humidity 
  trends over China were overwhelmingly positive over 1951 to 1994, with the largest 
  and most statistically significant trends in north-west China north of 35&deg;N 
  and west of 105&deg;E. Trends were larger in summer and night-time trends were 
  generally larger than daytime ones.</p>
<p>Recently New et al. (2000) have estimated linear trends for annual and seasonal 
  values of surface vapour pressure over land using calculated monthly vapour 
  pressure data from climate stations. <a href="#fig226">Figure 2.26</a> 
  shows trends for the 21 years from 1975 to 1995, corresponding to much of the 
  recent period of global warming described in <a href="056.htm#2223">Section 
  2.2.2.3</a>. Although the uncertain quality of the data prevents any definitive 
  conclusions about statistical significance, nominal significance of trends at 
  the 5% level was estimated after smoothing the annual data to reduce the influence 
  of outliers at the beginning and end of this short series. Few Southern Hemisphere 
  data have been analysed, but <a href="#fig226">Figure 2.26</a> shows 
  that there have been widespread nominally significant increases in annual mean 
  water vapour in the Northern Hemisphere. These increases are reflected in the 
  individual seasons, although nominally significant annual mean increases are 
  more extensive. Regional decreases over eastern Canada are explained by colder 
  conditions in the winter half year associated with the increasingly positive 
  phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (<a href="086.htm#265">Section 2.6.5</a>).</p>
<h4><a name="2532"></a>2.5.3.2 Lower-tropospheric water vapour</h4>
<p>Radiosonde and satellite observations of water vapour above the surface have 
  been analysed for evidence of long-term change. Both data sources have had serious 
  data quality and temporal homogeneity problems (Elliott, 1995), although recent 
  work to determine trends in water vapour from the surface to 500 hPa since 1973 
  has been based on radiosonde data judged to be largely unaffected by these problems 
  (Ross and Elliott, 2001). Published satellite data are insufficiently homogeneous 
  or too short in length to deduce reliable trends or low-frequency variations.

<p><i>Radiosonde observation</i>s<br>
  Ross and Elliott (1996, 1998) analysed surface-to-500 hPa precipitable water 
  over the Northern Hemisphere for 1973 to 1995 using quality-controlled data. 
  Increases in precipitable water were found over North America except for north-east 
  Canada. Over Eurasia, only China and the Pacific islands show coherent regional 
  increases. The remainder of Eurasia shows a mixture of positive and negative 
  trends, with a tendency for negative trends over Eastern Europe and western 
  Russia. Mid-tropospheric water vapour trends tend to be of the same sign as 
  temperature trends over North America, China, and the Pacific, but elsewhere 
  the temperature trends are more consistently positive than the water vapour 
  trends. <a href="#fig227">Figure 2.27</a> summarises the results. Lower-tropo-spheric 
  dew-point data for the period 1961 to 1995 also show increases, though smaller 
  than those for the 1973 to 1995 period, and few are statistically significant 
  (Ross and Elliott, 2001). </p>
<p>Zhai and Eskridge (1997) found increases of about 1 to 3%/decade in surface-to-200 
  hPa precipitable water over China for 1970 to 1990. Increases were most significant 
  in spring. Percentage trends were larger over the 700 to 400 hPa layer than 
  the surface-700 hPa layer. Gutzler (1996) found that specific humidity data 
  at 1,000, 700, and 300 hPa at four western tropical Pacific radiosonde stations 
  from 1973 to 1993 gave increases of 3 to 9%/decade, with larger percentage increases 
  at increasing height above the surface. In contrast, Peixoto and Oort (1996) 
  found decreases in zonal mean relative humidity between 1974 and 1988. The decreases 
  are more marked at 300 hPa, where they are more likely to be associated with 
  instrument changes than at lower levels, and are more pronounced at higher latitudes 
  than in the tropics. </p>
