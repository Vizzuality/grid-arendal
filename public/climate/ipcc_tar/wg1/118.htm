<h4>3.6.3.2 Uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> by the ocean</h4>
<p>Ocean uptake is constrained to some degree by observations of anthropogenic 
  tracers. Three transient tracers are commonly used. First, anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> 
  itself gives a direct benchmark for model estimates of the quantity and distribution 
  of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> that has penetrated the ocean since the pre-industrial 
  era. Anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> can be inventoried by an indirect method whereby 
  carbon concentration is compared to what would be expected from water exposed 
  to pre-industrial air (Gruber et al., 1996). The <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> 
  released in the early 1960s by atmospheric nuclear testing (commonly called 
  bomb <sup>14</sup>C) provides a second tracer; the content of bomb <sup>14</sup>C 
  in the ocean is used to constrain global air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> exchange (Wanninkhof 
  et al., 1992), and ocean model results can be compared with its penetration 
  depth as a benchmark for vertical transport (Broecker et al., 1995). Bomb <sup>14</sup>C 
  is computed by subtracting the observed <sup>14</sup>C concentration from an 
  estimate of its pre-industrial value (Broecker et al., 1995). Finally, CFCs 
  also constrain the downward transport of tracers in ocean models. No natural 
  background needs to be subtracted from CFCs. None of these three tracers provide 
  a perfect indicator of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake: CO<sub>2</sub> equilibrates 
  with the atmosphere ten times faster than <sup>14</sup>C and ten times slower 
  than CFCs; anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> and <sup>14</sup>C are indirectly estimated. 
  As part of the Ocean Carbon-Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (OCMIP), a comparison 
  of carbon models with respect to all three anthropogenic tracers is in progress 
  (Orr and Dutay, 1999; Orr et al., 2001).</p>
<p>Although regional estimates show discrepancies, modelled estimates of anthropogenic 
  tracers agree reasonably well with observations when integrated globally. The 
  mean value of the penetration depth of bomb <sup>14</sup>C for all observational 
  sites during the late 1970s is 390 &plusmn; 39 m (Broecker et al., 1995). For 
  the same years and stations, modelled estimates range between 283 and 376 m 
  (Orr et al., 2001). Modelled and observed CFC concentrations have been compared 
  locally but not yet globally (England 1995; Robitaille and Weaver, 1995; Orr 
  and Dutay, 1999). Modelled anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> inventory since 1800 
  is comparable to the estimate of 40 &plusmn; 9 PgC for the Atlantic Ocean (Gruber, 
  1998) and 20&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;3 PgC for the Indian Ocean (Sabine et al., 1999; 
  Orr et al., 2001). Latitude-depth profiles of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> in 
  the Atlantic, extracted from data and from models, are shown in <a href="#fig39">Figure 
  3.9</a>. Modelled CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for the global ocean between 1800 and 
  1990 ranges between 100 and 133 PgC (<a href="116.htm#fig38">Figure 3.8</a>), 
  comparable to the preliminary data-based estimate of 107 &plusmn;&nbsp;27 PgC 
  for the global ocean, which includes the Pacific value of 45&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;15 
  PgC (Feely et al., 1999a). Although in reasonable agreement with basin and global 
  estimates of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>, modelled inventories exhibit large 
  differences at the regional scale: models tend to underestimate the inventory 
  of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> between 50&deg;S and 50&deg;N in the Atlantic 
  and Indian Oceans, and to overestimate it at high latitudes (Sabine et al., 
  1999; Orr et al., 2001). In the Southern Ocean the uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> 
  varies by a factor of two among models (Orr et al., 2001). The difficulty for 
  models in reproducing the spatial structure of anthropogenic tracers may be 
  indicative of problems in ocean physics mentioned earlier, and may be responsible 
  for the increasing range of model estimates when future CO<sub>2</sub> uptake 
  is projected by the same models (<a href="#fig310">Figure 3.10c</a>).</p>
<p>The most recent model estimates of the ocean-atmosphere flux obtained with 
  process-based models are -1.5 to -2.2 for 1980 to 1989 (<a href="111.htm#tab34">Table 
  3.4</a>), in agreement with earlier model estimates for the same period (Enting 
  et al., 1994; Orr et al., 2001). These estimates are fully consistent with the 
  budget based on atmospheric observations alone (<a href="097.htm#tab31">Table 
  3.1</a>), with estimates based on <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and <img src="images/delta-s.gif" width="8" height="10"><sup>13</sup>C 
  observations (<a href="111.htm#tab34">Table 3.4</a>), and with the SAR estimate 
  of -2.0 &plusmn; 0.8 PgC/yr. <a href="116.htm#fig38">Figure 3.8</a> shows modelled 
  ocean CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for 1900 to 2000. (These results do not include 
  natural variability and therefore appear smoother than in reality.) The oceanic 
  regions absorbing the largest quantities of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> according 
  to models are those where older waters come in contact with the atmosphere, 
  such as high latitudes and upwelling regions of the equator. In contrast, modelled 
  sub-tropical regions rapidly saturate at atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> level and 
  do not absorb large quantities of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> (Sarmiento et 
  al., 1992; Orr et al., 2001).</p>

            <b>Figure 3.10:</b> Projections of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake

            run with IS92a CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations as given in the SAR: 
            (a) CO<sub>2</sub> only, and (b) with these CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations

            model with CO<sub>2</sub> and sulphate aerosol forcing from IS92a 
            (Cramer et al., 2000). Panel (b) also shows the envelope of the results 
            from panel (a) (in grey). (c) Ten process-based ocean carbon models 
            were run with the same CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, assuming a constant 
            climate (Orr and Dutay, 1999; Orr et al., 2000). A further six models 
            were used to estimate the climate change impact on ocean CO<sub>2</sub> 
            uptake as a proportional change from the CO<sub>2</sub>-only case. 
            The resulting changes were imposed on the mean trajectory of the simulations

            uptake; the range does not include the range of representations of 
            ocean physical transport, which is depicted in panel (c).</td>
