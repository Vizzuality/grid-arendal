<p><i>Sea-ice extent</i><br>
  Sea-ice extent is expected to become a sensitive indicator of a warming climate, 
  although only recently have long records become available in the Arctic, and 
  our knowledge of Antarctic sea-ice extent before the 1970s is very limited. 
</p>
<p>Sea-ice extent (the area within the ice-ocean margin) 
  was observed from space from 1973 to 1976 using the ESMR (Electrically Scanning 
  Microwave Radiometer) satellite-based instrument, and then continuously from 
  1978 using the SSMR (Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer) (1978 to 1987) 
  and SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave/Imager) (1987 to present). By inter-calibrating 
  data from different satellites, Bj&oslash;rgo et al. (1997) and subsequently 
  Cavalieri et al. (1997) obtained uniform monthly estimates of sea-ice extent 
  for both hemispheres from November 1978 through to December 1996. Over this 
  period, the sea-ice extent over the Northern Hemisphere showed a decrease of 
  -2.8 &plusmn; 0.3%/decade (Parkinson et al., 1999), consistent with Johannessen 
  et al. (1995) (<a href="#fig214">Figure 2.14</a>). The Arctic decrease 
  was strongest in the Eastern Hemisphere and most apparent in summer (Maslanik 
  et al., 1996; Parkinson et al., 1999). </p>
<p>Hemispheric and regional data sets for the Arctic enable the satellite-derived 
  trends in <a href="#fig214">Figure 2.14</a> to be placed into a century 
  scale context. <a href="#fig215">Figure 2.15</a> shows annual time-series 
  of the Northern Hemisphere ice extent by season from 1901 to 1999 using in situ 
  data before the satellite era (Vinnikov et al., 1999a). It should be emphasised 
  that the spatial coverage of earlier data is not complete, with the largest 
  data voids in the autumn and winter. Because few data were available, the variability 
  of the autumn and wintertime series in <a href="#fig215">Figure 2.15</a> 
  is smaller during the early decades of the century. Essentially no data for 
  summer and autumn are available for the World War II period. The summer decrease 
  that is largely responsible for the overall downward trend during the satellite 
  era is present during the entire second half of the 20th century (<a href="#fig215">Figure 
  2.15</a>). This decrease represents about 15% of the average summer extent in 
  the first half of the 20th century. Spring values show a somewhat weaker negative 
  trend over the same period with a total reduction of near 8%, but there is only 
  a slight and uncertain downward trend in autumn and winter since about 1970.</p>
<p>The overall recent decrease of Arctic ice extent is, at first sight, consistent 
  with the recent pattern of high latitude temperature change, which includes 
  a warming over most of the sub-arctic land areas (<a href="052.htm#2221">Section 
  2.2.2.1</a>). Some of this pattern of warming has been attributed to recent 
  trends in the atmospheric circulation of the North Atlantic Oscillation and 
  its Arctic-wide manifestation, the Arctic Oscillation (<a href="083.htm#26">Section 
  2.6</a>). </p>
<p>Related to the decline in sea-ice extent is a decrease in the length of the 
  sea-ice season (Parkinson, 2000) and an increase in the length of the Arctic 
  summer melting season between 1979 and 1998, also derived from satellite data. 
  The shortest season was 1979 (57 days) and the longest was in 1998 (81 days) 
  with an increasing trend of 5 days per decade (Smith, 1998, updated). The 7% 
  per decade reduction in the multi-year ice area during 1978 to 1998 is relatively 
  large compared with an approximately 2%/decade decrease in the total ice area 
  in winter (Johannessen et al., 1999). This reflects greater summer melting, 
  consistent with the results of Smith (1998). </p>
<p>Over the period 1979 to 1996, the Antarctic (Cavalieri et al., 1997; Parkinson 
  et al., 1999) shows a weak increase of 1.3 &plusmn; 0.2%/decade. <a href="#fig216">Figure 
  2.16</a> (for 1973 to 1998) shows a new integrated data set of Antarctic sea-ice 
  extent that was put together for the new European Centre for Medium-range Weather 
  Forecasts (ECMWF) 40-year reanalysis that extends the record back to 1973. While 
  showing the same weak increase after 1979, it also suggests greater ice extents 
  in the mid-1970s. Although century scale time-series cannot be constructed for 
  the Antarctic, de la Mare (1997) has used whaling ship logs to infer significantly 
  greater ice extent in the Southern Ocean during the 1930s and 1940s than during 
  recent decades. The indirect nature of the earlier evidence, however, introduces 
  substantial uncertainty into this conclusion.</p>
<p><i>Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves</i><br>
  Although warming over Antarctica as a whole appears to have been perhaps half 
  of a degree in the last half century (Jacka and Budd, 1998), the Antarctic Peninsula 
  has warmed more rapidly, by more than 2&deg;C since the 1940s (King, 1994). This 
  regional warming, whose cause has yet to be fully discovered (but see <a href="087.htm#266">Section 
  2.6.6</a>), has led to a southerly migration of the climatic limit of ice shelves 
  so that five ice shelves have retreated over the last century (Vaughan and Doake, 
  1996). The progressive retreat of ice shelves eventually resulted in the spectacular 
  final-stage collapse of the Prince Gustav and parts of the Larsen ice shelves 
  in 1995. Each left only a small residual shelf. After the collapse, James Ross 
  Island, situated off the northern end of the Antarctic Peninsula, is now circumnavigable 
  by ship for the first time since it was discovered in the early 19th century 
  (Vaughan and Lachlan-Cope, 1995). </p>
<p><i>Sea-ice thickness</i><br>
  Our knowledge of sea-ice thickness in the Arctic comes largely from upward sonar 
  profiling by USA and British submarines since 1958 and 1971, respectively. Rothrock 
  et al. (1999) compared late summer September to October data from 1993, 1996 
  and 1997 from an USA civilian submarine research programme with data from six 
  summer cruises from the period 1958 to 1976. Thickness was adjusted to mid-September 
  values to account for seasonal variability. The significant decline in mean 
  ice thickness was observed for all regions, increasing from the Canada Basin 
  towards Europe (<a href="#fig217">Figure 2.17</a>). Overall, there was 
  a mean reduction in thickness of 42% from 3.1 to 1.8 m the earlier period to 
  the present.</p>
<p>Wadhams and Davis (2000) have compared ice thickness changes between October 
  1976 and September 1996 between 81&deg;N and 90&deg;N near the 0&deg; meridian. 
  The overall decline in mean sea-ice thickness between 1976 and 1996 was 43%. 
  Over every one degree of latitude, both a significant decline in ice thickness 
  and some completely open water were observed. Despite these dramatic results, 
  it is not known whether these changes reflect long-term change or a major mode 
  of multi-decadal variability. Vinje et al. (1998) measured the thickness of 
  ice exiting the Arctic Ocean through Fram Strait from 1990 to 1996 using moored 
  upward looking sonars and reported a rather different result. The mean annual 
  ice thickness in Fram Strait varied from 2.64 to 3.41 m. These observations 
  were consistent with Arctic Ocean-wide ice thickness estimates made by drilling 
  from Soviet Ice Stations from 1972 to 1981 and from submarine transects from 
  1960 to 1982, suggesting little change in ice thickness from the 1960s and 1970s 
  to the 1990s.</p>
  Nagurnyi et al. (1994, 1999) used measurements of long surface gravity waves 
  in the Arctic ice pack to estimate the mean ice thickness from wave attenuation. 
  These measurements are available for the winters of 1978/79 to 1990/91. Johannessen 
  et al. (1999) demonstrated a strong correlation between these ice thickness 
  estimates and the area of multi-year (MY) ice in the Arctic Ocean as obtained 
  from the SSMR and SSM/I. Both the area of MY ice and the ice thickness (winter) 
  estimates show a decrease of 5 to 7%/decade, considerably less than the submarine 
  estimates (late summer). Even though the satellite measurements have continued 
  for more than twenty years, they are inadequate to distinguish between changes 
  due to long-term trends or interannual/inter-decadal variability (Johannessen 
  et al., 1999).<br>
