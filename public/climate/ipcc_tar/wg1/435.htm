<h4><a name="11543"></a>11.5.4.3 Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets</h4>
<p>Several modelling studies have been conducted for time periods of several centuries 
  to millennia (Van de Wal and Oerlemans, 1997; Warner and Budd, 1998; Huybrechts 
  and De Wolde, 1999; Greve, 2000). A main conclusion is that the ice sheets would 
  continue to react to the imposed climatic change during the next millennium, 
  even if the warming stabilised early in the 22nd century. Whereas Greenland 
  and Antarctica may largely counteract one another for most of the 21st century 
  (<a href="418.htm">Section 11.2.3.4</a>), this situation would no longer hold 
  after that and their combined contribution would be a rise in sea level. </p>
<p><i>Greenland ice sheet</i><br>
  The Greenland ice sheet is the most vulnerable to climatic warming. As the temperature 
  rises, ablation will increase. For moderate warming, the ice sheet can be retained 
  with reduced extent and modified shape if this results in less ablation and/or 
  a decrease in the rate of ice discharge into the sea, each of which currently 
  account for about half the accumulation (<a href="416.htm">Section 11.2.3</a>). 
  The discharge can be reduced by thinning of the ice sheet near the grounding 
  line. Ablation can be reduced by a change in the area-elevation distribution. 
  However, once ablation has increased enough to equal accumulation, the ice sheet 
  cannot survive, since discharge cannot be less than zero. This situation occurs 
  for an annual-average warming of 2.7&deg;C for the present ice-sheet topography, 
  and for a slightly larger warming for a retreating ice sheet (Huybrechts et 
  al., 1991; see also Oerlemans, 1991; Van de Wal and Oerlemans, 1994). Models 
  show that under these circumstances the Greenland ice sheet eventually disappears, 
  except for residual glaciers at high altitudes. By using the AOGCM ratios of 
  the Greenland temperature to the global average (<a href="427.htm#tab1113">Table 
  11.13</a>) with the results of the calibrated simple model (<a href="431.htm">Section 
  11.5.1.2</a> and <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="353.htm#933">Section 
  9.3.3</a>) we project increases in Greenland temperatures by 2100 of more than 
  2.7&deg;C for nearly all combinations of SRES scenarios and AOGCMs. The maximum 
  by 2100 is 9&deg;C.</p>
<p>Huybrechts and De Wolde (1999) (<a href="432.htm#fig1116">Figure 11.16</a>) 
  (see also Letreguilly et al., 1991) find the Greenland ice sheet contributes 
  about 3 m of sea level rise equivalent over a thousand years under their mid-range 
  scenario, in which the Greenland temperature change passes through 4&deg;C in 
  2100 before stabilising at 5.5&deg;C after 2130. Taking into account the high-latitude 
  amplification of warming, this temperature change is consistent with mid-range 
  stabilisation scenarios (<a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="354.htm">Section 
  9.3.3.1</a> and <a href="354.htm#fig917">Figure 9.17(b)</a>). For a warming 
  of 8&deg;C, they calculate a contribution of about 6 m. Their experiments take 
  into account the effect of concomitant increases in precipitation (which reduces 
  sensitivity) but also of the precipitation fraction falling as rain (which strongly 
  enhances sensitivity for the larger temperature increases). Disregarding the 
  effects of accumulation changes and rainfall, Greve (2000) reports that loss 
  of mass would occur at a rate giving a sea level rise of between 1 mm/yr for 
  a year-round temperature perturbation of 3&deg;C to as much as 7 mm/yr for a 
  sustained warming of 12&deg;C, the latter being an extreme scenario in which 
  the ice sheet would be largely eliminated within 1,000 years. </p>
<p><i>West Antarctic ice sheet</i><br>
  The WAIS contains enough ice to raise sea level by 6 m. It has received particular 
  attention because it has been the most dynamic part of the Antarctic ice sheet 
  in the recent geological past, and because most of it is grounded below sea 
  level - a situation that according to models proposed in the 1970s could 
  lead to flow instabilities and rapid ice discharge into the ocean when the surrounding 
  ice shelves are weakened (Thomas, 1973; Weertman, 1974; Thomas et al., 1979). 
  Geological evidence suggests that WAIS may have been smaller than today at least 
  once during the last million years (Scherer et al., 1998). The potential of 
  WAIS to collapse in response to future climate change is still a subject of 
  debate and controversy. </p>
<p>The discharge of the WAIS is dominated by fast-flowing ice streams, dynamically 
  constrained at four boundaries: the transition zone where grounded ice joins 
  the floating ice shelf (Van der Veen, 1985; Herterich, 1987), the interface 
  of ice with bedrock that is lubricated by sediment and water (Blankenship et 
  al., 1986; Anandakrishnan et al., 1998; Bell et al., 1998), the shear zone where 
  fast-moving ice meets relatively static ice at the transverse margins of ice 
  streams (Echelmeyer et al., 1994; Jacobson and Raymond, 1998), and the ice-stream 
  onset regions where slowly flowing inland ice accelerates into the ice streams. 
  Mechanisms have been proposed for dynamic changes at each of these boundaries.</p>
<p>Early studies emphasised the role of the ice shelf boundary in ice discharge 
  by introducing the concept of a "back-stress" believed to buttress 
  the grounded ice sheet and prevent it from collapsing. Recent work, however, 
  both modelling and measurement, places greater emphasis on the other ice stream 
  boundaries. Force balance studies on Ice Stream B show no evidence of stresses 
  generated by the Ross ice shelf, and mechanical control emanates almost entirely 
  from the lateral margins (Whillans and Van der Veen, 1997). If confirmed for 
  the other Siple Coast ice streams, this suggests ice stream flow fields to be 
  little influenced by conditions in the ice shelf, similar to the situation elsewhere 
  at the Antarctic margin (Mayer and Huybrechts, 1999). </p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is a considerable body of evidence for ice stream variability, 
  and the above analyses may not apply to dynamic situations involving large thinning 
  or grounding line change. Ice Stream C largely stopped about a century ago (Retzlaff 
  and Bentley, 1993) and Ice Stream B decelerated by 20% within a decade (Stephenson 
  and Bindschadler, 1988). The mechanisms for these oscillations are not well 
  understood and have been ascribed to processes such as basal water diversion 
  to a neighbouring ice stream (Anandakrishnan and Alley, 1997) or thermomechanical 
  interactions between competing catchment areas (Payne, 1998). Despite ice stream 
  variability in the latter model on the millenial time-scale, the overall volume 
  of the WAIS hardly changed, supporting the suggestion that ice streams may act 
  to remove the imbalance of individual drainage basins and to stabilise rather 
  than destabilise WAIS (Hindmarsh, 1993).</p>
<p>The WAIS was much larger during the LGM and has probably lost up to two thirds 
  of its volume since then (Bindschadler, 1998). The largest losses have been 
  from grounding line retreat below the present WAIS ice shelves (Ross and Filchner-Ronne), 
  most likely as a gradual response to rising sea levels subsequent to melting 
  of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (Ingolfsson et al., 1998). Local imbalances, 
  both positive and negative, are presently occurring (Shabtaie and Bentley, 1987; 
  Whillans and Bindschadler, 1988; Bindschadler and Vornberger, 1998; Hamilton 
  et al., 1998; Rignot, 1998a,b; Wingham, et al., 1998), but there is no conclusive 
  observational evidence (from monitoring of surface elevation, see <a href="416.htm#11232">Section 
  11.2.3.2</a>) that WAIS overall is making a significant contribution to global 
  average sea level change (Bentley, 1997, 1998a,b; Bindschadler, 1998; Oppenheimer, 
  1998; Wingham et al. 1998). Conway et al. (1999) suggest that grounding line 
  retreat since the LGM may still be ongoing, giving an average rate of recession 
  corresponding to a rate of sea level rise of 0.9 mm/yr (Bindschadler, 1998). 
  If projected into the future, this would imply disappearance of WAIS in 4,000 
  to 7,000 years (Bindschadler, 1998). However, geological estimates of ocean 
  volume increase over the last 6,000 years place an upper limit of about half 
  this amount on global sea level rise (<a href="423.htm#1131">Section 11.3.1</a>).</p>
<p>Recent spectacular break-ups of the Larsen ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula 
  (Vaughan and Doake, 1996; Doake et al., 1998) demonstrate the existence of an 
  abrupt thermal limit on ice shelf viability associated with regional atmospheric 
  warming (Skvarca et al., 1998). However, the WAIS ice shelves are not immediately 
  threatened by this mechanism, which would require a further warming of 10&deg;C 
  before the -5&deg;C mean annual isotherm reached their ice fronts (Vaughan and 
  Doake, 1996). Although atmospheric warming would increase the rate of deformation 
  of the ice, causing the ice shelf to thin, response time-scales are of the order 
  of several hundred years (Rommelaere and MacAyeal, 1997; Huybrechts and de Wolde, 
  1999).</p>
<p>In view of these considerations, it is now widely agreed that major loss of 
  grounded ice, and accelerated sea level rise, is very unlikely during the 21st 
  century. An interdisciplinary panel of international experts applying the techniques 
  of risk assessment to the future evolution of WAIS concluded that there is a 
  98% chance that WAIS will not collapse in the next 100 years, defined as a change 
  that contributes at least 10 mm/yr to global sea level change (Vaughan and Spouge, 
  2001). The probability of a contribution to sea level (exceeding 0.5 m) by the 
  year 2100 was 5%. These results are broadly consistent with an earlier assessment 
  by Titus and Narayanan (1996) based on a US-only panel, who found a 5% chance 
  of a 0.16 m contribution and 1% chance of a 0.3 m contribution to sea level 
  rise from WAIS by 2100. We note that Vaughan and Spouge also report a probability 
  of 5% for WAIS giving a sea level fall exceeding 0.4 m within the same time 
  frame, while Titus and Narayanan give 0.18 m.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, on a longer time-scale, changes in ice dynamics could result in 
  significantly increased outflow of ice into the ice shelves and a grounding 
  line retreat. Large-scale models show both of these phenomena to be sensitive 
  to basal melting below the ice shelves (Warner and Budd, 1998; Huybrechts and 
  De Wolde, 1999). Model studies do not agree on the sensitivity of the basal 
  melting to an oceanic warming: for instance, one shows a quad-rupling of the 
  basal melting rate below the Amery ice shelf in East Antarctica for an adjacent 
  sea warming of 1&deg;C (Williams et al., 1998), while another claims that warmer 
  sea temperatures would reduce melting rates below the Ronne-Filchner ice shelves 
  through alteration to sea-ice formation and the thermohaline circulation (Nicholls, 
  1997). Changes in open ocean circulation may also play a role. Warner and Budd 
  (1998) suggest that even for moderate climatic warmings of a few degrees, a 
  large increase in bottom melting of 5 m/yr becomes the dominant factor in the 
  longer-term response of the Antarctic ice sheet. In their model, this causes 
  the demise of WAIS ice shelves in a few hundred years and would float a large 
  part of the WAIS (and marine portions of East Antarctica) after 1,000 years. 
  Predicted rates of sea level rise are between 1.5 and 3.0 mm/yr depending on 
  whether accumulation rates increase together with the warming. Allowing for 
  runoff in addition to increased accumulation, Huybrechts and De Wolde (1999) 
  find a maximum Antarctic contribution to global sea level rise of 2.5 mm/yr 
  for an extreme scenario involving a warming of 8&deg;C and a bottom melting 
  rate of 10 m/yr. These figures are upper limits based on results currently available 
  from numerical models, which do not resolve ice streams explicitly and which 
  may not adequately predict the effect of ice shelf thinning on grounding line 
  retreat owing to physical uncertainties.</p>
<p>Based on a wide-ranging review, Oppenheimer (1998) argues that WAIS could disintegrate 
  within five to seven centuries following a warming of only a few degrees. Such 
  a collapse implies a rate of sea level rise of 10 mm/yr and an average speed-up 
  of the total outflow by at least a factor of 10 (Bentley, 1997, 1998a,b). However, 
  the majority opinion of a recent expert panel reported by Vaughan and Spouge 
  (2001) is that such outflow rates are not attainable. It is, therefore, also 
  plausible that WAIS may not make a significant contribution to sea level rise 
  over time-scales less than a millennium. Vaughan and Spouge (2001) attribute 
  a 50% probability to the latter scenario, but retained an equally large probability 
  that the sea level rise will be larger than 2 mm/yr after 1,000 years, emphasising 
  the inadequacy of our current understanding of the dynamics of WAIS, especially 
  for predictions on the longer time-scales.</p>
<p>Independent of bottom melting below the ice shelves and the possibility of 
  an ice-dynamic instability, surface melting sets an upper temperature limit 
  on the viability of the Antarctic ice sheet, because runoff would eventually 
  become the dominant wastage mechanism (as would be the case for Greenland in 
  a climate several degrees warmer than today). For warmings of more than 10&deg;C, 
  simple runoff models predict that an ablation zone would develop around the 
  Antarctic coast, making the mass balance at sea level sufficiently negative 
  that the grounded ice would no longer be able to feed an ice shelf. Also the 
  WAIS ice shelves would disintegrate to near to their inland limits as summer 
  temperatures rise above the thermal limit of ice shelf viability believed to 
  be responsible for the recent collapse of ice shelves at the northern tip of 
  the Antarctic Peninsula. Disintegration of WAIS would in that case result, because 
  the WAIS cannot retreat to higher ground once its margins are subjected to surface 
  melting and begin to recede (Huybrechts, 1994). Depending on the strength of 
  the warming, such a disintegration would take at least a few millennia.</p>
<p><i>East Antarctic ice sheet</i><br>
  Thresholds for disintegration of the East Antarctic ice sheet by surface melting 
  involve warmings above 20&deg;C, a situation that has not occurred for at least 
  the last 15 million years (Barker et al., 1999), and which is far more than 
  thought possible under any scenario of climatic change currently under consideration. 
  In that case, the ice sheet would decay over a period of at least 10,000 years. 
  However, the recent inference of complex flow patterns in the interior of the 
  East Antarctic ice sheet demonstrates the existence of ice-streaming features 
  penetrating far inland, which may be indicative of a more dynamic regime than 
  believed so far (Bamber et al., 2000; Huybrechts et al., 2000)</p>
