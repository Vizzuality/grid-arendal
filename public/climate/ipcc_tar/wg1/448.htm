<h4>12.2.3.1 Natural climate forcing</h4>
<p>Since the SAR, there has been much progress in attempting to understand the 
  climate response to fluctuations in solar luminosity and to volcanism. These 
  appear to be the most important among a broad range of natural external climate 
  forcings at decadal and centennial time-scales. The mechanisms of these forcings, 
  their reconstruction and associated uncertainties are described in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>, and further details of the simulated responses are given in <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>, <a href="328.htm">Section 8.6.3</a>. </p>
<p><i>Volcanic forcing</i><br>
  The radiative forcing due to volcanic aerosols from the recent El Chichon and 
  Mt. Pinatubo eruptions has been estimated from satellite and other data to be 
  -3 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (peak forcing; after Hansen et al., 1998). The forcing associated 
  with historic eruptions before the satellite era is more uncertain. Sato et 
  al. (1993) estimated aerosol optical depth from ground-based observations over 
  the last century (see also Stothers, 1996; Grieser and Schoenwiese, 1999). Prior 
  to that, reconstructions have been based on various sources of data (ice cores, 
  historic documents etc.; see Lamb, 1970; Simkin et al., 1981; Robock and Free, 
  1995; Crowley and Kim, 1999; Free and Robock, 1999). There is uncertainty of 
  about a factor of two in the peak forcing in reconstructions of historic volcanic 
  forcing in the pre-satellite era (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>). </p>
<p> <i>Solar forcing</i><br>
  The variation of solar irradiance with the 11-year sunspot cycle has been assessed 
  with some accuracy over more than 20 years, although measurements of the magnitude 
  of modulations of solar irradiance between solar cycles are less certain (see 
  <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>). The estimation of earlier solar irradiance 
  fluctuations, although based on physical mechanisms, is indirect. Hence our 
  confidence in the range of solar radiation on century time-scales is low, and 
  confidence in the details of the time-history is even lower (Harrison and Shine, 
  1999; <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>). Several recent reconstructions estimate 
  that variations in solar irradiance give rise to a forcing at the Earth's 
  surface of about 0.6 to 0.7 Wm<sup>-2</sup> since the Maunder Minimum and about 
  half this over the 20th century (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>, <a href="245.htm#fig65">Figure 
  6.5</a>; Hoyt and Schatten, 1993; Lean et al., 1995; Lean, 1997; Froehlich and 
  Lean, 1998; Lockwood and Stamper, 1999). This is larger than the 0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  modulation of the 11-year solar cycle measured from satellites. (Note that we 
  discuss here the forcing at the Earth's surface, which is smaller than 
  that at the top of the atmosphere, due to the Earth's geometry and albedo.) 
  The reconstructions of Lean et al. (1995) and Hoyt and Schatten (1993), which 
  have been used in GCM detection studies, vary in amplitude and phase. Chapter 
  6, Figure 6.8 shows time-series of reconstructed solar and volcanic forcing 
  since the late 18th century. All reconstructions indicate that the direct effect 
  of variations in solar forcing over the 20th century was about 20 to 25% of 
  the change in forcing due to increases in the well-mixed greenhouse gases (see 
  <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>). </p>
<p>Reconstructions of climate forcing in the 20th century indicate that the net 
  natural climate forcing probably increased during the first half of the 20th 
  century, due to a period of low volcanism coinciding with a small increase in 
  solar forcing. Recent decades show negative natural forcing due to increasing 
  volcanism, which overwhelms the direct effect, if real, of a small increase 
  in solar radiation (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>, <a href="254.htm#tab613">Table 
  6.13</a>). </p>
