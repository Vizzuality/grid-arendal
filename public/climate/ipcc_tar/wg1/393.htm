<h3>10.5.2 Simulations of Climate Change </h3>
<p>Since the SAR, several multi-year RCM simulations of anthropogenic climate 
  change, either from equilibrium experiments or for time slices of transient 
  simulations, have become available (<a href="405.htm">Appendix 10.3</a>).</p>

<p><a name="fig1013"></a>An important issue when analysing RCM simulations of 
  climate change is the significance of the modelled responses. To date RCM simulations 
  have been mostly aimed at evaluating models and processes rather than producing 
  projections and, as such, they have been relatively short (10 years or less). 
  At short time-scales, natural climate variability may mask all but the largest 
  responses. For example, in an analysis of 10-year RCM simulations over Europe, 
  Machenhauer et al. (1998) concluded that generally only the full area averaged 
  seasonal mean surface temperature responses were statistically significant, 
  and in only a few cases were sub-domain deviations from the mean response significant. 
  The changes in precipitation were highly variable in space, and, in each season, 
  they were only significant in those few sub-areas having the largest changes. 
  Similar results were documented by Pan et al. (2000) and Kato et al. (2001) 
  for the USA and East Asia, respectively. Hence, 30-year samples may be required 
  to confidently assess the mesoscale response of a RCM (Jones et al., 1997). 
  Partly to improve signal to noise definition, a transient RCM simulation of 
  140 years duration was recently conducted (Hennessy et al., 1998; McGregor et 
  al., 1999).</p>
<p>Despite the limitations in simulation length, most RCM experiments clearly 
  indicate that, while the large-scale patterns of surface climate change in the 
  nested and driving models are similar, the mesoscale details of the simulated 
  changes can be quite different. For example, significantly different patterns 
  of temperature and rainfall changes were found in a regional climate change 
  simulation for Australia (Whetton et al., 2001). This was most clearly seen 
  in mountainous areas (<a href="#fig1013">Figure 10.13</a>). Winter rainfall 
  in southern Victoria increased in the RCM simulation, but decreased in the driving 
  GCM. High resolution topographical modification of the regional precipitation 
  change signal in nested RCM simulations has been documented in other studies 
  (Jones et al., 1997; Giorgi et al., 1998; Machenhauer et al., 1998; Kato et 
  al., 2001).</p>
<p>The response in an RCM can also be modified by changes in regional feedbacks. 
  In a 20 year nested climate change experiment for the Indian monsoon region, 
  Hassell and Jones (1999) showed that a maximum anomaly of 5&deg;C seen in central 
  northern India in the GCM simulation was reduced and moved to the north-west 
  in the nested RCM, with a secondary maximum appearing to the south-east (<a href="#fig1014">Figure 
  10.14</a>). The shift of the main maximum was attributed to deficiencies in 
  the GCM control climate that promoted excessive drying of the soil in North-west 
  India. The secondary maximum was attributed to a complex response involving 
  the RCM's better representation of the flow patterns in southern India 
  resulting from an improved representation of the Western Ghats mountains. In 
  this instance, it was argued that the improved realism of the RCM's control 
  simulation increases confidence in its response.</p>
<p>The high resolution representation of mountainous areas in an RCM has made 
  it possible to show that the simulated surface air temperature change signal 
  due to <sup>23</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> concentration could have a marked elevation dependency, resulting 
  in more pronounced warming at high elevations than low elevations as shown in 
  <a href="#fig1015">Figure 10.15</a> (Giorgi et al., 1997). This is primarily 
  caused by a depletion of the snow pack in enhanced GHG conditions and the associated 
  snow albedo feedback mechanism, and it is consistent with observed temperature 
  trends for anomalous warm winters over the alpine region. A similar elevation 
  modulation of the climate change signal has been confirmed in later studies 
  utilising both RCMs and GCMs (e.g., Leung and Ghan, 1999b; Fyfe and Flato, 1999).</p>
<p>The impact of land-use changes on regional climate has been addressed in RCM 
  simulations (e.g., Wei and Fu, 1998; Pan et al., 1999; Pielke et al., 1999; 
  Chase et al., 2000). Land-use changes due to human activities could induce climate 
  modifications, at the regional and local scale, of magnitude similar to the 
  observed climatic changes during the last century (Pielke et al., 1999; Chase 
  et al., 2000). The issue of regional climate modification by land-use change 
  has been little explored within the context of the global change debate and, 
  because of its potential importance, is in need of further examination.</p>

<h4><a name="10522"></a>10.5.2.2 Climate variability and extreme events</h4>
<p>Changes in climate variability between control and 2xCO<sub>2</sub> simulations with a 
  nested RCM for the Great Plains of the USA have been reported (Mearns, 1999; 
  Mearns et al., 1999). There is indication of significant decreases in daily 
  temperature variability in winter and increases in temperature variability in 
  summer. These changes are very similar to those of the driving GCM, while changes 
  in variability of precipitation are quite different in the nested and driving 
  models, particularly in summer, with increases being more pronounced in the 
  RCM. Similar results have been documented over the Iberian Peninsula (Gallardo 
  et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Different studies have analysed changes in the frequency of heavy precipitation 
  events in enhanced GHG climate conditions over the European region (Sch&auml;r 
  et al., 1996; Frei et al., 1998; Durman et al., 2001). They all indicate an 
  increase of up to several tens of percentage points in the frequency of occurrence 
  of precipitation events exceeding 30 mm/day, with these increases being less 
  than those simulated by the driving GCMs (see also Jones et al., 1997). In a 
  transient RCM simulation for 1961 to 2100 over south-eastern Australia, substantial 
  increases were found in the frequency of extreme daily rainfall and days of 
  extreme high maximum temperature (Hennessy et al., 1998), In this long simulation, 
  changes in the frequency of long-duration extreme events (such as droughts) 
  were identified. Finally, increases in the number of typhoons reaching mainland 
  China and in the number of heavy rain days were reported for enhanced GHG conditions 
  in RCM simulations over East Asia (Gao et al., 2001).</p>
