<h2><a name="14"></a>1.4 A &#145;Road-map' to this Report </h2>
<p>This Report, the third IPCC Working Group I Assessment Report since 1990, assesses 
  the state of scientific understanding of the climate system and its variability 
  and change, in particular human-induced climate change. This section provides 
  a &#145;road map' to the 14 chapters of this report and the major issues 
  they are designed to address. Each chapter provides an initial summary of the 
  Working Group I Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) and then goes on to emphasise 
  the progress made since then. The chapters can be viewed as covering the following 
  three broad areas: past changes and the factors that can force climate change 
  (<a href="048.htm">Chapters 2</a> to <a href="212.htm">6</a>), our present understanding 
  and ability to model the climate system (<a href="260.htm">Chapters 7</a>, <a href="308.htm">8</a> 
  and <a href="500.htm">14</a>) and possible future climate change (<a href="338.htm">Chapters 
  9</a> to <a href="474.htm">13</a>).</p>
<p>In order to understand, assess and quantify the possible human influence on 
  climate, an analysis of past climate variability and change is required (<a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>). The chapter tackles such questions as: how much is the world warming 
  and is the recent global warming unusual? It looks in detail at trends and variability 
  during the recent instrumental period (the last 100 years or so) and draws on 
  palaeo-data to put them into the context of climate over much longer periods.</p>
<p>There are many factors that are known to influence climate, both natural and 
  human-induced. The increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols 
  through human activity is of particular concern. <a href="095.htm">Chapters 
  3</a> to <a href="160.htm">5</a> examine how well the three most important human 
  contributions to the changing composition of the atmosphere; carbon dioxide, 
  other greenhouse gases and aerosols, are understood, including the physical, 
  chemical and biological processes which determine the atmospheric concentrations 
  of these components. The next step, taken in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>, 
  is to evaluate how this change in atmospheric composition has affected radiative 
  forcing within the context of other factors such as land-use change, volcanic 
  eruptions and solar variations.</p>
<p>Understanding the climate response to these various radiative forcings and 
  projecting how they could affect future climate requires an understanding of 
  the physical processes and feedbacks in the climate system and an ability to 
  model them (<a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>). The only tools available for such 
  projections of future climate are numerical models of the climate system of 
  various complexity. An evaluation of such models against observations of the 
  present and past climate and model intercomparisons provide the basis for confidence 
  in such tools (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>).</p>
<p>Climate models together with scenarios of future emissions of radiatively active 
  atmospheric components, as for example the SRES scenarios (Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; 
  et al., 2000), recently developed by IPCC specifically for this purpose, are 
  used to project future climate change. State-of-the-art projections for the 
  next 100 years are assessed in Chapter 9, mainly at a global level, but also 
  including large-scale patterns, their spatial and temporal variability and extreme 
  events. Partly in response to the need for more details of climate change at 
  a regional level, research in this area has been particularly active over the 
  last 5 years. A new chapter, compared to previous assessments, has been included 
  which examines the various techniques available to derive regional climate projections 
  and, as far as is currently possible, assesses regional climate change information 
  (<a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>). <a href="408.htm">Chapter 11</a> assesses 
  the current state of knowledge of the rate of change of global average and regional 
  sea level in response to climate change.</p>
<p>A key conclusion from the SAR was that "the balance of evidence suggests 
  that there is a discernible human influence on global climate". <a href="439.htm">Chapter 
  12</a> assesses research over the last 5 years on the detection and attribution 
  of climate change drawing on the developments in observational research (<a href="048.htm">Chapters 
  2</a> to <a href="212.htm">6</a>) and modelling (<a href="260.htm">Chapters 
  7</a> to <a href="373.htm">10</a>) to consider how this conclusion has changed.</p>
<p>Data derived directly from projections with climate models are often inappropriate 
  for assessing the impacts of climate change which can require detailed, regional 
  or local information as well as observational data describing current (or baseline) 
  climate. Climate change scenarios are plausible representations of future climate 
  constructed explicitly for impact assessment and form a key link between IPCC 
  Working Groups I and II. For the first time, Working Group I have included a 
  chapter dedicated to climate scenarios (<a href="474.htm">Chapter 13</a>) - 
  this is intended to provide an assessment of scenario generation techniques, 
  rather than to present scenarios themselves.</p>
<p>All chapters of the report highlight areas of certainty and uncertainty, and 
  gaps in current knowledge. <a href="500.htm">Chapter 14</a> draws together this 
  information to present key areas that need to be addressed to advance understanding 
  and reduce uncertainty in the science of climate change.</p>
<p>A comprehensive and integrated summary of all results of this assessment report 
  may be found in the Technical Summary in this volume. A brief summary highlighting 
  points of particular policy relevance is presented in the <a href="005.htm">Summary 
  for Policymakers</a>.</p>
