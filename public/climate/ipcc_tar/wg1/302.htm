<h3>7.6.4 North Atlantic Oscillation and Decadal Variability</h3>
<p>The NAO is the dominant pattern of wintertime atmospheric circulation variability 
  over the extra-tropical North Atlantic (Hurrell, 1995), and has exhibited decadal 
  variability and trends (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="083.htm">Section 
  2.6</a>). There is strong evidence indicating that much atmospheric circulation 
  variability in the form of the NAO arises from internal atmospheric processes 
  (Saravanan, 1998; Osborn et al., 1999). During winters when the stratospheric 
  vortex is stronger than normal, the NAO (and AO) tends to be in a positive phase 
  suggesting an interaction and perhaps even a downward influence from the stratosphere 
  to the troposphere (see <a href="279.htm">Sections 7.2.5</a> and <a href="301.htm">7.6.3</a>; 
  Baldwin and Dunkerton, 1999). The recent trend in the NAO/AO could possibly 
  thus be related to processes which are known to affect the strength of the strato-spheric 
  polar vortex such as tropical volcanic eruptions (Kodera, 1994; Kelly et al., 
  1996), ozone depletion, and changes in greenhouse gas concentrations resulting 
  from anthropogenic forcing (Shindell et al., 1999b).</p>
<p> It has long been recognised that fluctuations in SST are related to the strength 
  of the NAO, and Dickson et al. (1996, 2000) have shown a link to the ocean gyre 
  and thermohaline circulations. The leading mode of SST variability over the 
  North Atlantic during winter is associated with the NAO. During high NAO years 
  anomalous SSTs form a tri-polar pattern with a cold anomaly in the sub-polar 
  region, a warm anomaly in the middle latitudes, and a cold sub-tropical anomaly 
  (e.g., Deser and Blackmon, 1993), consistent with the spatial form of the anomalous 
  surface fluxes associated with the NAO pattern (Cayan, 1992). This indicates 
  that SST is responding to atmospheric forcing on seasonal time-scales (Deser 
  and Timlin, 1997). However, GCM simulations suggest that SST in the North Atlantic 
  can, in turn, have a marked effect on NAO (see <a href="300.htm">Section 7.6.2</a>). 
  Winter SST anomalies were observed to spread eastward along the path of the 
  Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current with a transit time-scale of a decade 
  (Sutton and Allen, 1997). These SST anomalies reflect anomalies in the heat 
  content of the deep winter mixed layers that when exposed to the atmosphere 
  in winter (Alexander and Deser, 1995) could affect the NAO, imprinting the advective 
  time-scale of the gyre on the atmosphere (McCartney et al., 1996). Moreover, 
  similar processes were identified in coupled GCM integrations (Groetzner et 
  al., 1998; Timmermann et al., 1998; Delworth and Mann, 2000) where changes in 
  SST due to oceanic processes (gyre advection or thermohaline circulation) affected 
  the NAO. This, in turn, leads to changes in heat and fresh water fluxes, and 
  in wind stress forcing of the oceanic circulation. Oceanic response to such 
  changes in the forcing produced a negative feedback loop, leading to decadal 
  oscillations. However, the role of these mechanisms is yet to be established.</p>
<p> Watanabe and Nitta (1999) have suggested that high latitude snow cover on 
  land is responsible for decadal changes in the NAO. Changes in sea-ice cover 
  in both the Labrador and Greenland Seas as well as over the Arctic also appear 
  to be well correlated with the NAO (Deser et al., 2000). Such changes may also 
  affect the atmosphere because of the large changes in sensible and latent heat 
  fluxes along the ice edge.</p>
