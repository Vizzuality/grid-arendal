<p>A number of new transient AOGCM simulations for the SRES A2 and B2 scenarios 
  have recently become available and a preliminary analysis was conducted by the 
  lead authors. This follows the procedure similar to that described in this section 
  in relation to <a href="384.htm#fig103">Figures 10.3</a> to <a href="384.htm#fig106">10.6</a>. 
  The results are presented in <a href="#box101">Box 10.1</a>.</p>

        use SRES emission scenarios </b> </div>
      <p><b>Introduction</b><br>
        This box summarises results on regional climate change obtained from a 
        set of nine AOGCM simulations undertaken using SRES preliminary marker 
        emission scenarios A2 and B2. The models are CGCM2, CSIRO Mk2, CSM 1.3, 
        ECHAM4/OPYC, GFDL_R30_c, HadCM3, MRI2, CCSR/NIES2, DOE PCM, (numbered 
        7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 23, 27, 31 and 30 in <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, 
        <a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a>). The results are based on data 
        for 2071 to 2100 and 1961 to 1990 that have been directly analysed and 
        assessed by the lead authors. These results should be treated as preliminary 
        only.</p>
      <p><b>Analysis</b><br>
        Regional changes in precipitation and temperature were calculated using 
        the same methodology as that of Giorgi and Francisco (2000b) (see <a href="382.htm#fig101">Figures 
        10.1</a>, <a href="384.htm#fig103">10.3</a> and <a href="384.htm#fig105">10.5</a>). 
        The results were then assessed for inter-model consistency using the same 
        method as that used in <a href="384.htm#fig104">Figures 10.4</a> and <a href="384.htm#fig106">10.6</a> 
        for the earlier set of simulations. The results for temperature are in 
        Box10.1, Figure1 and for precipitation in <a href="388.htm#box102">Box10.2</a>, 
        Figure2.</p>
      <p>The SRES results may be compared with the earlier results summarised 
        in Figures 10.4 and 10.6 (which will be referred to here as the IS92a 
        results). However, it should be noted that these two sets of results differ 
        in the set of models used (both in the model versions and in the total 
        number of simulations), and in the scenarios contrasted in each case (for 
        IS92a it is GHG-only versus GHG+sulphate and for SRES it is A2 versus 
        B2). Also, due to differences in the number of models, thresholds for 
        agreement are not the same in each case (although they have been chosen 
        to be as nearly equivalent as possible).</p>

            <p><b>Box 10.1, Figure 1: </b>Analysis of inter-model consistency 
              in regional relative warming (warming relative to each model's 
              global warming). Regions are classified as showing either agreement 
              on warming in excess of 40% above the global average (&#145;Much 
              greater than average warming'), agreement on warming greater 
              than the global average (&#145;Greater than average warming'), 
              agreement on warming less than the global average (&#145;Less than 
              average warming'), or disagreement amongst models on the magnitude 
              of regional relative warming (&#145;Inconsistent magnitude of warming'). 
              There is also a category for agreement on cooling (which never occurs). 
              A consistent result from at least seven of the nine models is deemed 
              necessary for agreement. The global annual average warming (DJF 
              and JJA combined) of the models used span 1.2 to 4.5&deg;C for A2 
              and 0.9 to 3.4&deg;C for B2, and therefore a regional 40% amplification 
              represents warming ranges of 1.7 to 6.3&deg;C for A2 and 1.3 to 
              4.7&deg;C for B2.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b><br>
        <i>SRES</i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Under both SRES cases, most land areas warm more rapidly than the 
          global average. The warming is in excess of 40% above the global average 
          in all high northern latitude regions and Tibet (ALA, GRL, NEU, NAS 
          and TIB) in DJF, and in the Mediterranean basin, central and northern 
          Asia and Tibet (MED, CAS, NAS, and TIB) in JJA. Only in South Asia and 
          southern South America (SAS and SSA) in JJA and southeast Asia (SEA) 
          in both seasons do the models consistently show warming less than the 
          global average.</li>
        <li>For precipitation, consistent increase is evident in both SRES scenarios 
          over high latitude regions (ALA, GRL, NAS and ANT) in both seasons, 
          northern mid-latitude regions and tropical Africa (WNA, ENA, NEU, CAS, 
          TIB, WAF and EAF) in DJF, and South Asia, East Asia and Tibet (SAS, 
          EAS and TIB) in JJA. Consistent precipitation decrease is present over 
          Central America (CAM) in DJF and over Australia and southern Africa 
          (NAU, SAU and SAF) in JJA.</li>
        <li>Differences between the A2 and B2 results are minor and are mainly 
          evident for precipitation. In the B2 scenario there are fewer regions 
          showing consistently large precipitation changes, and there is a slight 
          increase in the frequency of regions showing "inconsistent" 
          and "no change" results. As the climate forcing is smaller 
          in the B2 case and the climate response correspondingly weaker, some 
          differences of this nature are to be expected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>SRES versus IS92a</i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>In broad terms, the temperature results from SRES are similar to the 
          IS92a results. In each of the two SRES and IS92a cases, warming is in 
          excess of 40% above the global average in Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, 
          northern Asia, and Tibet (ALA, GRL, NAS and TIB) in DJF and in central 
          Asia and Tibet (CAS and TIB) in JJA. All four cases also show warming 
          less than the global average in South and Southeast Asia, and southern 
          South America (SAS, SEA and SSA) in JJA.</li>
        <li>The main difference in the results is that there are substantially 
          more instances for the SRES cases where there is disagreement on the 
          magnitude of the relative regional warming. This difference is mainly 
          evident in tropical and Southern Hemisphere regions.</li>
        <li>The precipitation results from SRES are also broadly similar to the 
          corresponding IS92a results. There are many regions where the direction 
          of precipitation change (although not necessarily the magnitude of this 
          change) is consistent across all four cases. In DJF this is true for 
          increase in northern mid- to high latitude regions, Antarctica and tropical 
          Africa (ALA, GRL, WNA, ENA, NEU, NAS, TIB, CAS, WAF, EAF and ANT) and 
          decrease in Central America (CAM). In JJA it is true for increase in 
          high latitude regions (ALA, GRL, NAS and ANT) and for decrease in southern 
          and northern Australia (SAU and NAU). Little change in Southeast Asia 
          in DJF and little change or increase over South Asia in JJA are also 
          consistent results.</li>
        <li>Although there are no cases where the SRES and IS92a results indicate 
          precipitation changes of opposite direction, there are some notable 
          differences. In the Sahara and in East Asia (SAH and EAS) in JJA, the 
          results for both SRES scenarios show consistent increase whereas this 
          was not true in either of the IS92a cases. On the other hand, in central 
          North America and northern Australia (CNA and NAU) in DJF, and in East 
          Africa (EAF) in JJA, the results for both SRES scenarios show model 
          disagreement whereas the IS92a scenarios showed a consistent direction 
          of change (increase in CNA, and decrease in EAF and NAU). It is also 
          notable that the consistent decrease in JJA precipitation over the Mediterranean 
          basin (MED) seen for both IS92a cases is present for SRES only for the 
          A2 scenario (for which the decrease is large).</li>

      <p><b>Uncertainty</b><br>
        The above comparisons concern the quantification of two different sources 
        of uncertainty represented in the cascade of uncertainty described in 
        <a href="474.htm">Chapter 13</a>, <a href="491.htm#1351">Section 13.5.1</a> 
        (<a href="477.htm#fig132">Figure 13.2</a>). These include uncertainties 
        in future emissions (IS92a GG and GS; SRES A2 and B2), and uncertainties 
        in modelling the response of the climate system to a given forcing (samples 
        of up to nine AOGCMs). Agreement across the different scenarios and climate 
        models suggests, relatively speaking, less uncertainty about the nature 
        of regional climate change than where there is disagreement. For example, 
        the agreement for northern latitude winter precipitation extends across 
        all emission scenarios and all models, whereas there is considerable disagreement 
        (greater uncertainty) for tropical areas in JJA. Note that these measures 
        of uncertainty are qualitative and applied on a relatively coarse spatial 
        scale. It should also be noted that the range of uncertainty covered by 
        the four emissions scenarios does not encompass the entire envelope of 
        uncertainty of emissions (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="348.htm">Section 
        9.2.2.4</a>, and <a href="474.htm">Chapter 13</a>, <a href="491.htm#1351">Section 
        13.5.1</a>). The range of models (representing the uncertainties in modelling 
        the response to a given forcing) is somewhat more complete than in earlier 
        analyses, but also limited.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The analysis described above is for broad area-averages only and the results 
  described should not be assumed to apply to all areas within these regions. 
  More focused regional studies have examined within-region spatial patterns of 
  change (Joubert and Tyson, 1996; Machenhauer et al., 1996, 1998; Pittock et 
  al., 1995; Whetton et al., 1996b; Carril et al., 1997; Labraga and Lopez, 1997). 
  Such studies can reveal important features which are consistent amongst models 
  but are not apparent in area-average regional results. For example, Labraga 
  and Lopez (1997) noted a tendency for simulated rainfall to decrease in northern 
  Amazonia and to increase in southern parts of this region. Jones R.N. et al. 
  (2000) noted a predominance of rainfall increase in the central equatorial Pacific 
  (northern Polynesia), but in the areas to the west and south-west the direction 
  of rainfall change was not clearly indicated.</p>

</table>
<p><a name="fig107"></a>To illustrate further inter-model variations in simulated 
  regional precipitation change, results obtained in model inter-comparison studies 
  for the Australian, Indian, North American and European regions are examined. 
  All of these regions have been extensively studied over the years using equilibrium 
  2xCO<sub>2</sub> experiments (such as those featured in IPCC, 1990), first generation 
  transient coupled AOGCMs (as in the SAR), and more recent AOGCMs available in 
  the DDC (<a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a>). This comparison also enables 
  an assessment of how the regional precipitation projections have changed as 
  the models evolved. </p>
<p>In the Australian region, the pattern of simulated precipitation change in 
  winter (JJA) has remained broadly similar across these three groups of experiments 
  and consists of rainfall decrease in sub-tropical latitudes and rainfall increase 
  south of 35 to 40&deg;S (Whetton et al., 1996a, 2001). However, as the latitude 
  of the boundary between these two zones varied between models, southernmost 
  parts of Australia lay in the zone where the direction of precipitation change 
  was inconsistent amongst models. In summer (DJF) the equilibrium 2xCO<sub>2</sub> 
  experiments showed a strong tendency for precipitation to increase, particularly 
  in the north-west of the continent. This tendency was replaced in the first 
  coupled AOGCMs by one of little change or precipitation decrease, which has 
  remained when the most recent coupled models are considered. Whetton et al. 
  (1996a) partly attributed the contrast in the regional precipitation response 
  of the two types of experiments to contrasts in their hemispheric patterns of 
  warming.</p>
<p>Lal et al. (1998b) surveyed the results for the Indian subcontinent of seventeen 
  climate change experiments including both equilibrium 2xCO<sub>2</sub> and transient 
  AOGCM simulations with and without sulphate aerosol forcing. In the simulations 
  forced only by GHG increases, most models show wet season (JJA) rainfall increases 
  over the region of less than 5% per degree of global warming. A minority of 
  experiments show rainfall decreases. The experiments which included scenarios 
  of increasing sulphate forcing all showed reduced rainfall increases, or stronger 
  rainfall decreases, than their corresponding GHG-only experiments. </p>
<p>For the central plains of North America, IPCC (1990) noted a good deal of similarity 
  in the response of equilibrium 2xCO<sub>2</sub> experiments, with precipitation 
  decreases prevailing in the summer and increases in the winter of less than 
  10%. In the second group of experiments (nine transient runs with AOGCMs) a 
  wider range of responses was found (in the SAR). In winter, changes in precipitation 
  ranged from about -12 to +20% for the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling, and most 
  of the models (six out of nine) exhibited increases. In summer, the range of 
  change was narrower, within &plusmn;10%, but there was no clear majority response 
  towards increases or decreases. Doherty and Mearns (1999) found that the CGCM1 
  and HadCM2 models simulated opposite changes in precipitation in both seasons 
  over North America. While overall there is a tendency for more decreases to 
  be simulated in the summer and more increases in the winter, there does not 
  seem to be a reduction in the uncertainty for this region through the progression 
  of climate models. </p>
<p>Many studies have considered GCM-simulated patterns of climate change in the 
  European region (e.g., Barrow et al., 1996; Hulme and Brown, 1998; Osborn and 
  Hulme, 1998; R&auml;is&auml;nen, 1998; Benestad et al. 1999; Osborn et al., 
  1999). Hulme et al. (2000) provide an overview of simulated changes in the region 
  by considering the results of twenty-three climate change simulations (forced 
  by GHG change only) produced between the years 1983 and 1998 and including mixed-layer 
  1x and 2xCO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium experiments as well as transient experiments. 
  <a href="#fig107">Figure 10.7</a> shows their results for simulated change in 
  annual precipitation, averaged by latitude and normalised to percentage change 
  per degree of global warming. It may be seen that the consensus amongst current 
  models for drying in southern Europe and wetter conditions in northern Europe 
  represents a continuation of a pattern established amongst the earlier simulations. 
  The effect of model development has primarily been to intensify this pattern 
  of response. </p>
<p>Variations across simulations in the regional enhanced GHG results of AOGCMs, 
  which are particularly evident for precipitation, represent a major uncertainty 
  in any assessment of regional climate change. Such variation may arise due to 
  differences in forcing, systematic model-to-model differences in the regional 
  response to a given forcing or differences due to natural decadal to inter-decadal 
  scale variability in the models. Giorgi and Francisco (2000a,b) analysed AOGCM 
  simulations including different models, forcing scenarios and ensembles of simulations, 
  and found that the greatest source of uncertainty in regional climate change 
  simulation was due to inter-model differences, with intra-ensemble and inter-scenario 
  differences being less important (see <a href="384.htm#fig103">Figures 10.3</a> 
  and <a href="384.htm#fig105">10.5</a>). However, it should be noted that Giorgi 
  and Francisco (2000a,b) used long (thirty year) means and large (sub-continental 
  scale) regions and that the uncertainty due to simulated natural variability 
  would be larger when shorter averaging periods, or smaller regions, are used. 
  The results of Hulme et al. (1999) also suggest that low-frequency natural climatic 
  variability is important at the sub-regional scale in Europe and can mask the 
  enhanced GHG signal.</p>
<p>Regional changes in the mean pattern of atmospheric circulation have been noted 
  in various studies, although typically the changes are not marked (e.g., Huth, 
  1997; Schubert, 1998). Indeed, the work of Conway (1998) and Wilby et al. (1998b) 
  suggests that the contribution of changes in synoptic circulation to regional 
  climate change may be relatively small compared to that of sub-synoptic processes.</p>
