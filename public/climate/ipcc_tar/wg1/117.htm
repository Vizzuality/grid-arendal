<h3>3.6.3 Evaluation of Ocean Models </h3>
<p>Natural and anthropogenic tracers have been extensively measured, most recently 
  as part of the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) and World Ocean Circulation 
  Experiment (WOCE). Because of these measurement campaigns, such tracers provide 
  important opportunities to evaluate representations of ocean physics and biogeochemistry 
  in models.</p>
<h4><a name="3631"></a>3.6.3.1 Natural carbon cycling in the ocean</h4>
<p>Most global ocean models of the carbon cycle are successful in reproducing 
  the main vertical and horizontal features of ocean carbon content (Maier-Reimer, 
  1993; Aumont, 1998; Murnane et al., 1999). The observed features reasonably 
  reproduced by all ocean models are the mean vertical gradient in DIC, with enriched 
  deep ocean concentrations (Goyet and Davies, 1997), and the spatial patterns 
  of surface <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> with outgassing in the tropics and uptake 
  at higher latitudes (Takahashi et al., 1999). Furthermore, models which incorporate 
  marine biology (including DOC and plankton dynamics) roughly reproduce the seasonal 
  cycle of surface ocean <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>, atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> after 
  it has been corrected for seasonal land variability, and surface chlorophyll 
  (Six and Maier-Reimer, 1996; Stephens et al., 1998; Aumont et al., 2001a). Ocean 
  carbon models can also roughly reproduce the phase and amplitude of interannual 
  variability of ocean <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in the equatorial Pacific (Winguth 
  et al., 1994; Le Qu&eacute;r&eacute; et al., 2000) in agreement with available 
  observations (Feely et al., 1997; 1999b; Boutin et al., 1999). </p>
<p>Although many first-order features can be reproduced by global models, there 
  are still important aspects of the ocean carbon cycle that are not well simulated, 
  because either marine biology or ocean physics are imperfectly reproduced. Ocean 
  carbon models have difficulties in reproducing the spatial structure of the 
  deep ocean <sup>14</sup>C (Orr et al., 2001), which suggests problems in simulating 
  the physical exchange of carbon between surface and the deep ocean. Models display 
  their largest disagreements where fewest observations exist, in particular in 
  the important region of the Southern Ocean where the mixing of tracers is subject 
  to large uncertainties (Caldeira and Duffy, 2000; Sarmiento et al., 2000; Orr 
  et al., 2001). In spite of these differences, all ocean carbon models estimate 
  zero interhemispheric transport of carbon (Sarmiento et al., 2000) whereas a 
  transport as large as 1 PgC/yr has been inferred from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  measurements (Keeling et al., 1989). Consideration of the global transport of 
  carbon by rivers reduces the discrepancy but does not remove it (Sarmiento and 
  Sundquist, 1992; Aumont et al., 2001b). Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> 
  measurements suggest that interhemispheric transport may be incorrectly simulated 
  by ocean models (Stephens et al., 1998), and could hint at difficulties in modelling 
  heat transport (Murnane et al., 1999). Recent data from the Southern Ocean, 
  however, seem closer to model results (Stephens, 1999) and the question about 
  interhemispheric transport thus remains open. These problems could partly be 
  resolved by a better representation of the physical transport of carbon in the 
  ocean, especially isopycnal diffusion, sub-grid eddy mixing, and sea-ice formation 
  (Stephens et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Three common problems related to marine biology in global ocean models are 
  discussed here. First, most models poorly represent the formation and dissolution 
  of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, which controls alkalinity. This process is often parameterized 
  as a function of direct or indirect observations (salinity, temperature, nutrients). 
  Although correct for the present day ocean, this parametrisation may not hold 
  for past or future conditions with different ocean circulation and surface water 
  fluxes. The alkalinity cycle is difficult to represent because the rate of CaCO<sub>3</sub> 
  formation derived from observations is consistently larger than the one required 
  by models for reproducing observed deep ocean alkalinity (Maier-Reimer, 1993; 
  Yamanaka and Tajika, 1996). Second, marine productivity tends to be underestimated 
  by models in sub-tropical regions and overestimated in the equatorial oceans 
  and at high latitudes in the North Pacific and Southern Oceans. The overestimation 
  may be caused by limitation in plankton growth by iron (Coale et al., 1996; 
  Boyd et al., 2000; Archer and Johnson, 2000), while under-estimation in the 
  sub-tropics partly stems from neglecting mesoscale variability (McGillicuddy 
  and Robinson, 1997; Oschlies and Gar&ccedil;on, 1998). The remaining discrepancies 
  might be attributed in part to more complex processes involving nitrogen fixation 
  (Karl et al., 1997). Finally, the tight coupling between carbon and either nitrogen 
  or phosphate, which is generally implicit in ocean carbon models, precludes 
  the simulation of past or future marine biological feedback mechanisms that 
  involve a partial decoupling between carbon and nutrients (see <a href="104.htm">Section 
  3.2.3</a>).</p>
