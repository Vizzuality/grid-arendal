<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>This report is the first complete assessment of the science of climate change 
  since Working Group I (WGI) of the IPCC produced its second report Climate Change 
  1995: The Science of Climate Change in 1996. It enlarges upon and updates the 
  information contained in that, and previous, reports, but primarily it assesses 
  new information and research, produced in the last five years. The report analyses 
  the enormous body of observations of all parts of the climate system, concluding 
  that this body of observations now gives a collective picture of a warming world. 
  The report catalogues the increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse 
  gases and assesses the effects of these gases and atmospheric aerosols in altering 
  the radiation balance of the Earth-atmosphere system. The report assesses the 
  understanding of the processes that govern the climate system and by studying 
  how well the new generation of climate models represent these processes, assesses 
  the suitability of the models for projecting climate change into the future. 
  A detailed study is made of human influence on climate and whether it can be 
  identified with any more confidence than in 1996, concluding that there is new 
  and stronger evidence that most of the observed warming observed over the last 
  50 years is attributable to human activities. Projections of future climate 
  change are presented using a wide range of scenarios of future emissions of 
  greenhouse gases and aerosols. Both temperature and sea level are projected 
  to continue to rise throughout the 21st century for all scenarios studied. Finally, 
  the report looks at the gaps in information and understanding that remain and 
  how these might be addressed. </p>
<p>This report on the scientific basis of climate change is the first part of 
  Climate Change 2001, the Third Assessment Report (TAR) of the IPCC. Other companion 
  assessment volumes have been produced by Working Group II (<a href="../wg2/index.htm">Impacts, 
  Adaptation and Vulnerability</a>) and by Working Group III (<a href="../wg3/index.htm">Mitigation</a>). 
  An important aim of the TAR is to provide objective information on which to 
  base climate change policies that will meet the Objective of the FCCC, expressed 
  in Article 2, of stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere 
  at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the 
  climate system. To assist further in this aim, as part of the TAR a <a href="../vol4/index.htm">Synthesis 
  Report</a> is being produced that will draw from the Working Group Reports scientific 
  and socio-economic information relevant to nine questions addressing particular 
  policy issues raised by the FCCC objective.</p>
<p>This report was compiled between July 1998 and January 2001, by 122 Lead Authors. 
  In addition, 515 Contributing Authors submitted draft text and information to 
  the Lead Authors. The draft report was circulated for review by experts, with 
  420 reviewers submitting valuable suggestions for improvement. This was followed 
  by review by governments and experts, through which several hundred more reviewers 
  participated. All the comments received were carefully analysed and assimilated 
  into a revised document for consideration at the session of Working Group I 
  held in Shanghai, 17 to 20 January 2001. There the Summary for Policymakers 
  was approved in detail and the underlying report accepted.<br>
</p>
<p>Strenuous efforts have also been made to maximise the ease of utility of the 
  report. As in 1996 the report contains a <a href="005.htm">Summary for Policymakers</a> 
  (SPM) and a <a href="010.htm">Technical Summary</a> (TS), in addition to the 
  main chapters in the report. The SPM and the TS follow the same structure, so 
  that more information on items of interest in the SPM can easily be found in 
  the TS. In turn, each section of the SPM and TS has been referenced to the appropriate 
  section of the relevant chapter by the use of Source Information, so that material 
  in the SPM and TS can easily be followed up in further detail in the chapters. 
  The report also contains an index at <a href="563.htm">Appendix VIII</a>, which 
  although not comprehensive allows for a search of the report at relatively top-level 
  broad categories. By the end of 2001 a more in-depth search will be possible 
  on an electronic version of the report, which will be found on the web at <a target="_top" href="http://www.ipcc.ch">http://www.ipcc.ch</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>We wish to express our sincere appreciation to all the Co-ordinating Lead Authors, 
  Lead Authors and Review Editors whose expertise, diligence and patience have 
  underpinned the successful completion of this report, and to the many contributors 
  and reviewers for their valuable and painstaking dedication and work. We are 
  grateful to Jean Jouzel, Herv&eacute; Le Treut, Buruhani Nyenzi, Jim Salinger, 
  John Stone and Francis Zwiers for helping to organise drafting meetings; and 
  to Wang Caifang for helping to organise the session of Working Group I held 
  in Shanghai, 17 to 20 January 2001.<br>
</p>
<p>We would also like to thank members of the Working Group I Bureau, Buruhani 
  Nyenzi, Armando Ramirez-Rojas, John Stone, John Zillman and Fortunat Joos for 
  their wise counsel and guidance throughout the preparation of the report.<br>
</p>
<p>We would particularly like to thank Dave Griggs, Maria Noguer, Paul van der 
  Linden, Kathy Maskell, Xiaosu Dai, Cathy Johnson, Anne Murrill and David Hall 
  in the Working Group I Technical Support Unit, with added assistance from Alison 
  Renshaw, for their tireless and good humoured support throughout the preparation 
  of the report. Thanks go to Christoph Ritz and Bettina Buechler of ProClim (Forum 
  for Climate and Global Change), a programme of the Swiss Academy of Sciences 
  in Bern for their assistance in producing the index to this report. We would 
  also like to thank Narasimhan Sundararaman, the Secretary of IPCC, Renate Christ, 
  Deputy Secretary, and the staff of the IPCC Secretariat, Rudie Bourgeois, Chantal 
  Ettori and Annie Courtin who provided logistical support for government liaison 
  and travel of experts from the developing and transitional economy countries.<br>
