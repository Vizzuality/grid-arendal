<h4>13.5.2.1 Scaling climate model response patterns</h4>

      <b>Figure 13.7:</b> Pattern correlations between the decadal ensemble mean 
      temperature (Northern Hemisphere only) from the HadCM2 experiment forced 
      with a 0.5%/yr increase in greenhouse gas concentrations (Gd) and: the scaled 
      ensemble mean pattern (solid line); the four scaled individual ensemble 
      member patterns - average coefficient (dashed line); and the scaled 
      ensemble mean pattern derived from the HadCM2 experiment forced with a 1%/yr 
      increase in greenhouse gas concentrations (Ga) (dotted line). The correlations 
      increase with time as the pattern of greenhouse gas response (the "signal") 
      increasingly dominates the random effects of internal climate variability 
      (the "noise"). The shaded area shows the spread of correlations 
      between the pairs of the individual members of the Gd ensemble; these correlations 
      are lower than those between the realised and scaled patterns above, indicating 
      that the scaled pattern is not due to internal climate variability. (Source: 
      Mitchell et al., 1999.) </td>

<p><a name="fig137"></a>Pattern-scaling methods allow a wider range of possible 
  future forcings (e.g., the full range of IS92 (Leggett et al., 1992) or SRES 
  emissions scenarios) and climate sensitivities (e.g., the 1.5&ordm;C to 4.5&ordm;C 
  IPCC range) to be represented in climate scenarios than if only the direct results 
  from GCM experiments were used. The approach involves normalising GCM response 
  patterns according to the global mean temperature change (although in some cases 
  zonal mean temperature changes have been used). These normalised patterns are 
  then rescaled using a scalar derived from simple climate models and representing 
  the particular scenario under consideration.</p>
<p>This pattern-scaling method was first suggested by Santer et al. (1990) and 
  was employed in the IPCC First Assessment Report to generate climate scenarios 
  for the year 2030 (Mitchell et al., 1990) using patterns from 2xCO<sub>2</sub> GCM 
  experiments. It has subsequently been widely adopted in climate scenario generators 
  (CSGs), for example in ESCAPE (Rotmans et al., 1994), IMAGE-2 (Alcamo et al., 
  1994), SCENGEN (Hulme et al., 1995a,b), SILMUSCEN (Carter et al., 1995, 1996a), 
  COSMIC (Schlesinger et al., 1997) and CLIMPACTS (Kenny et al., 2000). A climate 
  scenario generator is an integrated suite of simple models that takes emissions 
  or forcing scenarios as inputs and generates geographically distributed climate 
  scenarios combining response patterns of different greenhouse gases from GCMs 
  with observational climate data. CSGs allow multiple sources of uncertainty 
  to be easily represented in the calculated scenarios, usually by using pattern-scaling 
  methods.</p>
<p>Two fundamental assumptions of pattern-scaling are, first, that the defined 
  GCM response patterns adequately depict the climate "signal" under 
  anthropogenic forcing (see <a href="495.htm">Section 13.5.2.2</a>) and, second, 
  that these response patterns are representative across a wide range of possible 
  anthropogenic forcings. These assumptions have been explored by Mitchell et 
  al. (1999) who examined the effect of scaling decadal, ensemble mean temperature 
  and precipitation patterns in the suite of HadCM2 experiments. Although their 
  response patterns were defined using only 10-year means, using four-member ensemble 
  means improved the performance of the technique when applied to reconstructing 
  climate response patterns in AOGCM experiments forced with alternative scenarios 
  (see <a href="#fig137">Figure 13.7</a>). This confirmed earlier work by Oglesby 
  and Saltzman (1992), among others, who demonstrated that temperature response 
  patterns derived from equilibrium GCMs were fairly uniform over a wide range 
  of concentrations, scaling linearly with global mean temperature. The main exception 
  occurred in the regions of enhanced response near sea ice and snow margins. 
  Mitchell et al. (1999) concluded that the uncertainties introduced by scaling 
  ensemble decadal mean temperature patterns across different forcing scenarios 
  are smaller than those due to the model's internal variability, although 
  this conclusion may not hold for variables with high spatial variability such 
  as precipitation.</p>
<p>Two situations where the pattern-scaling techniques may need more cautious 
  application are in the cases of stabilisation forcing scenarios and heterogenous 
  aerosol forcing. Whetton et al. (1998b) have shown that for parts of the Southern 
  Hemisphere a highly non-linear regional rainfall response was demonstrated in 
  an AOGCM forced with a stabilisation scenario, a response that could not easily 
  be handled using a linear pattern-scaling technique. In the case of heterogeneous 
  forcing, similar global mean warmings can be associated with quite different 
  regional patterns, depending on the magnitude and pattern of the aerosol forcing. 
  Pattern-scaling using single global scalars is unlikely to work in such cases. 
  There is some evidence, however, to suggest that separate greenhouse gas and 
  aerosol response patterns can be assumed to be additive (Ramaswamy and Chen, 
  1997) and pattern-scaling methods have subsequently been adapted by Schlesinger 
  et al. (1997, 2000) for the case of heterogeneously forced scenarios. This is 
  an area, however, where poor signal-to-noise ratios hamper the application of 
  the technique and caution is advised.</p>
<p>The above discussion demonstrates that pattern-scaling techniques provide a 
  low cost alternative to expensive AOGCM and RCM experiments for creating a range 
  of climate scenarios that embrace uncertainties relating to different emissions, 
  concentration and forcing scenarios and to different climate model responses. 
  The technique almost certainly performs best in the case of surface air temperature 
  and in cases where the response pattern has been constructed so as to maximise 
  the signal-to-noise ratio. When climate scenarios are needed that include the 
  effects of sulphate aerosol forcing, regionally differentiated response patterns 
  and scalars must be defined and signal-to-noise ratios should be quantified. 
  It must be remembered, however, that while these techniques are a convenient 
  way of handling several types of uncertainty simultaneously, they introduce 
  an uncertainty of their own into climate scenarios that is difficult to quantify. 
  Little work has been done on exploring whether patterns of change in inter-annual 
  or inter-daily climate variability are amenable to scaling methods. </p>
