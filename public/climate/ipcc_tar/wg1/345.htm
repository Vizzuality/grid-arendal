      <b>Figure 9.1:</b> Global mean temperature change for 1%/yr CO<sub>2</sub> 
      increase with subsequent stabilisation at 2xCO<sub>2</sub> and 4cCO<sub>2</sub>. 
      The red curves are from a coupled AOGCM simulation (GFDL_R15_a) while the 
      green curves are from a simple illustrative model with no exchange of energy 
      with the deep ocean. The "transient climate response", TCR, is 
      the temperature change at the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling and the "equilibrium 
      climate sensitivity", T2x, is the temperature change after the system 
      has reached a new equilibrium for doubled CO<sub>2</sub>, i.e., after the 
      "additional warming commitment" has been realised. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><a name="fig91"></a>The temperature change at any time during a climate change 
  integration depends on the competing effects of all of the processes that affect 
  energy input, output, and storage in the ocean. In particular, the global mean 
  temperature change which occurs at the time of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling for the 
  specific case of a 1%/yr increase of CO<sub>2</sub> is termed the "transient 
  climate response" (TCR) of the system. This temperature change, indicated 
  in <a href="#fig91">Figure 9.1</a>, integrates all processes operating in the 
  system, including the strength of the feedbacks and the rate of heat storage 
  in the ocean, to give a straightforward measure of model response to a change 
  in forcing. The range of TCR values serves to illustrate and calibrate differences 
  in model response to the same standardised forcing. Analogous TCR measures may 
  be used, and compared among models, for other forcing scenarios. </p>
<p><i>Equilibrium climate sensitivity</i><br>
  The "equilibrium climate sensitivity" (IPCC 1990, 1996) is defined 
  as the change in global mean temperature, T<sub>2x</sub>, that results when 
  the climate system, or a climate model, attains a new equilibrium with the forcing 
  change F<sub>2x</sub> resulting from a doubling of the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration. For this new equilibrium dH/dt = 0 in the simple heat budget 
  equation and F<sub>2x</sub> = <img src="images/alfa-s.gif" width="8" height="8">T<sub>2x</sub> 
  indicating a balance between energy input and output. The equilibrium climate 
  sensitivity</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>T<sub>2x</sub> = F<sub>2x</sub>/<img src="images/alfa-s.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>is inversely proportional to <img src="images/alfa-s.gif" width="8" height="8">, 
  which measures the strength of the feedback processes in the system that act 
  to counter a change in forcing. The equilibrium climate sensitivity is a straightforward, 
  although averaged, measure of how the system responds to a specific forcing 
  change and may be used to compare model responses, calibrate simple climate 
  models, and to scale temperature changes in other circumstances. </p>
<p>In earlier assessments, the climate sensitivity was obtained from calculations 
  made with AGCMs coupled to mixed-layer upper ocean models (referred to as mixed-layer 
  models). In that case there is no exchange of heat with the deep ocean and a 
  model can be integrated to a new equilibrium in a few tens of years. For a full 
  coupled atmosphere/ocean GCM, however, the heat exchange with the deep ocean 
  delays equilibration and several millennia, rather than several decades, are 
  required to attain it. This difference is illustrated in <a href="#fig91">Figure 
  9.1</a> where the smooth green curve illustrates the rapid approach to a new 
  climate equilibrium in an idealised mixed-layer case while the red curve is 
  the result of a coupled model integration and indicates the much longer time 
  needed to attain equilibrium when there is interaction with the deep ocean.</p>
<p><i>Effective climate sensitivity</i><br>
  Although the definition of equilibrium climate sensitivity is straightforward, 
  it applies to the special case of equilibrium climate change for doubled CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and requires very long simulations to evaluate with a coupled model. The "effective 
  climate sensitivity" is a related measure that circumvents this requirement. 
  The inverse of the feedback term a is evaluated from model output for evolving 
  non-equilibrium conditions as </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> 1/<img src="images/alfa-s.gif" width="8" height="8"><sub>e</sub> = T / (F 
    - dH<sub>o</sub>/dt) = T / (F - F<sub>o</sub>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the effective climate sensitivity is calculated as </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> T<sub>e</sub> = F<sub>2x</sub>/<img src="images/alfa-s.gif" width="8" height="8"><sub>e</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>with units and magnitudes directly comparable to the equilibrium sensitivity. 
  The effective sensitivity becomes the equilibrium sensitivity under equilibrium 
  conditions with 2xCO<sub>2</sub> forcing. The effective climate sensitivity 
  is a measure of the strength of the feedbacks at a particular time and it may 
  vary with forcing history and climate state. </p>
<p><i>Warming commitment</i><br>
  An increase in forcing implies a "commitment" to future warming even 
  if the forcing stops increasing and is held at a constant value. At any time, 
  the "additional warming commitment" is the further increase in temperature, 
  over and above the increase that has already been experienced, that will occur 
  before the system reaches a new equilibrium with radiative forcing stabilised 
  at the current value. This behaviour is illustrated in <a href="#fig91">Figure 
  9.1</a> for the idealised case of instantaneous stabilisation at 2x and 4xCO<sub>2</sub> 
  . Analogous behaviour would be seen for more realistic stabilisation scenarios.
