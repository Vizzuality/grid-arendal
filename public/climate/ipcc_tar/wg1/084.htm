<h3><a name="263"></a>2.6.3 Decadal to Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation, and 
  the <br>
  North Pacific Oscillation </h3>
<p>Recently, &#145;ENSO-like' spatial patterns in the climate system, which 
  operate on decadal to multi-decadal time-scales, have been identified. This 
  lower-frequency SST variability is less equatorially confined in the central 
  and eastern Pacific, and relatively more prominent over the extra-tropics, especially 
  the north-west Pacific, and has a similar counterpart in night marine air temperatures 
  (Tanimoto et al., 1993; Folland et al., 1999a; Allan, 2000). The corresponding 
  sea level pressure (SLP) signature is also strongest over the North Pacific, 
  and its December-February counterpart in the mid-troposphere more closely resembles 
  the Pacific-North America (PNA) pattern (Zhang et al., 1997b; Livezey and Smith, 
  1999). There is ambiguity about whether inter-decadal Pacific-wide features 
  are independent of global warming. In the longer Folland et al. (1999) analyses 
  since 1911 they appear to be largely independent, but in the Livezey and Smith 
  analysis of more recent SST data they are an integral part of a global warming 
  signal. Using a different method of analysis of data since 1901, Moron et al. 
  (1998) find a global warming signal whose pattern in the Pacific is intermediate 
  between these two analyses.</p>
<p>The PDO of Mantua et al. (1997), with lower-frequency variations in the leading 
  North Pacific SST pattern, may be related to the same Pacific-wide features, 
  and parallels the dominant pattern of North Pacific SLP variability. The relationship 
  is such that cooler than average SSTs occur during periods of lower than average 
  SLP over the central North Pacific and vice versa. Recently, the IPO, a Pacific 
  basin-wide feature, has been described, which includes low-frequency variations 
  in climate over the North Pacific (Power et al., 1998, 1999; Folland et al., 
  1999a). The time-series of this feature is broadly similar to the inter-decadal 
  part of the North Pacific PDO index of Mantua et al. (1997). The IPO may be 
  a Pacific-wide manifestation of the PDO and seems to be part of a continuous 
  spectrum of low-frequency modulation of ENSO, and so may be partly stochastic. 
  When the IPO is in a positive phase, SST over a large area of the south-west 
  Pacific is cold, as is SST over the extra-tropical north-west Pacific. SST over 
  the central tropical Pacific is warm but less obviously warm over the equatorial 
  far eastern Pacific unlike ENSO. Warmth also extends into the tropical west 
  Pacific, unlike the situation on the ENSO time-scale. </p>
<p>The IPO shows three major phases this century: positive from 1922 to 1946 and 
  from 1978 to at least 1998, with a negative phase between 1947 and 1976. Arguably, 
  the structure of this pattern, nearly symmetrical about the equator and only 
  subtly different from ENSO, is a strong indication of the importance of the 
  tropical Pacific for many remote climates on all time-scales (Garreaud and Battisti, 
  1999). Power et al. (1999) showed that the two phases of the IPO appear to modulate 
  year-to-year ENSO precipitation variability over Australia. Salinger and Mullan 
  (1999) showed that prominent sub-bidecadal climate variations in New Zealand, 
  identified in the temperature signal by Folland and Salinger (1995), are related 
  to a SST pattern like the IPO. The IPO is a significant source of decadal climate 
  variation throughout the South Pacific, and modulates ENSO climate variability 
  in this region (Salinger et al., 2001). Similarly, the PDO (and likely the IPO) 
  may play a key role in modulating ENSO teleconnections across North America 
  on inter-decadal time-scales (Gershunov and Barnett, 1998; Livezey and Smith, 
  1999). </p>
<p>A simple and robust index of climate variability over the North Pacific is 
  the area-weighted mean SLP, averaged over most of the extra-tropical North Pacific 
  Ocean, of Trenberth and Hurrell (1994). A general reduction in SLP after about 
  1976 has been particularly evident during the winter half (November to March) 
  of many of these years. This is characterised by a deeper-than-normal Aleutian 
  low pressure system, accompanied by stronger-than-normal westerly winds across 
  the central North Pacific and enhanced southerly to south-westerly flow along 
  the west coast of North America, as reviewed in the SAR (Figure 3.17). Consequently, 
  there have been increases in surface air temperature and SST over much of western 
  North America and the eastern North Pacific, respectively, over the past two 
  decades, especially in winter, but decreases in SST, or only modest warming, 
  over parts of the central extra-tropical North Pacific (<a href="057.htm#fig210">Figure 
  2.10</a>). Numerous studies have suggested that the mid-1970s changes in the 
  atmospheric and oceanic circulation may reflect one or more low-frequency variations 
  over the North Pacific, one being the PDO (Kawamura, 1994; Latif and Barnett, 
  1994; Mann and Park, 1994, 1996; Deser and Blackmon 1995; Zhang et al., 1997b; 
  White and Cayan, 1998; Enfield and Mestas-Nu&ntilde;ez, 1999).</p>
