<h4>7.2.1.2 Representation of water vapour in models</h4>
<p>General circulation models do not impose a fixed relative humidity. Assumptions 
  built into the models directly govern the relative humidity only in the sparse 
  set of grid boxes that are actively convecting, where the choice of convection 
  scheme determines the humidity. In the case of moist convective adjustment, 
  the relative humidity after convection is explicitly set to a predetermined 
  profile, whereas the mass flux schemes compute a humidity profile based on microphysical 
  assumptions of varying complexity. The relative humidity elsewhere is determined 
  by explicitly resolved dynamical processes, and in fact undergoes marked spatial 
  (e.g., <a href="266.htm#fig71">Figure 7.1b,c</a>) and temporal fluctuations. 
  Nonetheless, all models studied to date produce a positive water vapour feedback 
  consistent with the supposition that water vapour increases in such a way as 
  to keep the relative humidity approximately unchanged at all levels (Held and 
  Soden, 2000). The strength of the water vapour feedback is consistent amongst 
  models, despite considerable differences in the treatment of convection and 
  microphysics (Cess et al., 1990).</p>
<p> The "convective region" is potentially a source of modelling errors, 
  since the evaporation of detrained precipitation and other poorly characterised 
  and heavily parametrized processes are essential to the moistening of the atmosphere. 
  Tompkins and Emanuel (2000) showed that in a single-column model, numerical 
  convergence of the simulated water vapour profile requires a vertical resolution 
  better than 25 mb in pressure (see also Emanuel and Zivkovic-Rothman, 1999). 
  Thus, the apparent lack of sensitivity of water vapour feedback in current GCMs 
  to the way convection is treated may be an artefact of insufficient vertical 
  resolution. An alternative view is that the water vapour flux is vigorous enough 
  to keep the convective region at a substantial fraction of saturation, so that 
  the details of the moistening process do not matter much. In this case the convection 
  essentially extends the boundary layer into the free troposphere, making condensed 
  water abundantly available to evaporation, but in the form of droplets or crystals. 
  Indeed, Dessler and Sherwood (2000) find that satellite observations of tropical 
  water vapour can be understood without detailed microphysical considerations, 
  even in the convective region. Radiosonde observations (Kley et al., 1997) and 
  satellite UTH data (Soden and Fu, 1995) reveal free troposphere relative humidities 
  of 50 to 70% throughout the convective region. Udelhofen and Hartmann (1995) 
  find that moisture decays away from convective systems with a characteristic 
  scale of 500 km, so that convection need not be too closely spaced to maintain 
  a uniformly moistened region. As noted by Held and Soden (2000), the evidence 
  for the opposite view, that convective region air becomes drier as temperature 
  increases, is weak.</p>
<p> This moistening of large-scale tropical subsiding zones by large-scale advection 
  is a process explicitly resolved in models, and in which one can have reasonably 
  high confidence. Care must still be taken with the design of numerical advection 
  methods to avoid spurious transport. In this regard, there has been notable 
  progress since the SAR as models are increasingly using semi-Lagrangian and 
  other advanced advection methods in place of spectral advection of water vapour 
  (Williamson and Rasch, 1994). These methods virtually eliminate spurious transport 
  arising from the need to adjust negative moisture regions, as commonly happens 
  in spectral advection. </p>
<p> In the extra-tropics the ubiquitous large-scale synoptic eddies which dominate 
  moisture transport are explicitly represented in GCMs, and there is reasonably 
  high confidence in simulated mid-latitude water vapour feedback. The eddies 
  maintain a fairly uniform monthly mean relative humidity of 30 to 50% throughout 
  the year (Soden and Fu, 1995; Bates and Jackson, 1997).</p>
<p> Simulation of water vapour variations with natural climate fluctuations such 
  as the annual cycle and El Ni&ntilde;o can help provide tests of the verisimilitude 
  of models but may not be sufficient for assessing climate change due to increases 
  in greenhouse gases (Bony et al., 1995). Models are quite successful at reproducing 
  the climatological free tropospheric humidity pattern (e.g., <a href="266.htm#fig71">Figure 
  7.1b,c</a>). Model-satellite comparisons of UTH are still at a rather early 
  stage of development; the AMIP simulations did not archive enough fields to 
  provide an adequate understanding of UTH, and there are problems in determining 
  which model level should be compared to the satellite data. Also there are uncertainties 
  in UTH retrievals (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>). Caveats notwithstanding, 
  the ensemble mean of the AMIP simulations shows a moist bias in UTH compared 
  to satellite data, but this result is rendered uncertain by apparent inconsistencies 
  in the computation of model relative humidities for intercomparison purposes. 
  The models studied by AMIP (Bates and Jackson, 1997) appear to show little skill 
  in reproducing the seasonal or interannual variations of convective region UTH, 
  though many show significant correlations between simulated and observed sub-tropical 
  and extra-tropical UTH fluctuations. The latter lends some confidence to the 
  simulated water vapour feedback, as the dry sub-tropics and extra-tropics account 
  for a large part of the feedback. Del Genio et al. (1994) found good agreement 
  between the observed seasonal cycle of zonal mean UTH, and that simulated by 
  the GISS model.</p>
<p> Humidity is important to water vapour feedback only to the extent that it 
  alters OLR. Because the radiative effects of water vapour are logarithmic in 
  water vapour concentration, rather large errors in humidity can lead to small 
  errors in OLR, and systematic underestimations in the contrast between moist 
  and dry air can have little effect on climate sensitivity (Held and Soden, 2000). 
  Most GCMs reproduce the climatological pattern of clear-sky OLR very accurately 
  (Duvel et al., 1997). In addition, it has been shown that the CCM3 model tracks 
  the observed seasonal cycle of zonal mean clear-sky OLR to within 5 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (Kiehl 
  et al., 1998), the GFDL model reproduces tropical mean OLR fluctuations over 
  the course of an El Ni&ntilde;o event (Soden, 1997), and the collection of models 
  studied under the AMIP project reproduces interannual variability of the clear-sky 
  greenhouse parameter with errors generally under 25% for sea surface temperatures 
  (SSTs) under 25&deg;C (Duvel et al., 1997). Errors become larger over warmer 
  waters, owing to inaccuracies in the way the simulated atmospheric circulation 
  responds to the imposed SSTs (which may also not be accurate). The LMD model 
  shows close agreement with the observed seasonal cycle of greenhouse trapping 
  (Bony et al., 1995), but models vary considerably in their ability to track 
  this cycle (Duvel et al., 1997).</p>
<p> Indirect evidence for validity of the positive water vapour feedback in present 
  models can be found in studies of interannual variability of global mean temperature: 
  Hall and Manabe (1999) found that suppression of positive water vapour feedback 
  in the GFDL model led to unrealistically low variability. An important development 
  since the SAR is the proliferation of evidence that the tropics during the Last 
  Glacial Maximum were 2 to 5&deg;C colder than the present tropics. Much of the 
  cooling can be simulated in GCMs which incorporate the observed reduction in 
  CO<sub>2</sub> at the Last Glacial Maximum (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>). 
  Without water vapour feedback comparable to that currently yielded by GCMs, 
  there would be a problem accounting for the magnitude of the observed cooling 
  in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere.</p>
