        <i><b>Figure 7.6:</b> Idealised feedback loops involving sea ice. The 
        signs attached to the arrows indicate the correlation between changes 
        in the quantity of the outgoing box with that of the ingoing box, e.g., 
        more sea ice leads to larger albedo. Resulting correlations of a loop 
        are circled and they indicate whether a process is self-reinforced (positive 
        sign) or damped (negative sign). Generally, resulting negative correlations 
        can lead to oscillations, whereas resulting positive correlations may 
        lead to instabilities. The classical ice-albedo effect is shown in the 
        left loop, a feedback involving the overlying atmosphere is on the right.</i></p>

<p><a name="fig76"></a>Sea ice plays an important role in moderating heat exchange 
  between the ocean and atmosphere at high latitudes, especially by controlling 
  the heat flux through openings in the ice. Sea ice also interacts with the broader 
  climate system via the ice albedo feedback, which amplifies projected climate 
  warming at high latitudes, and by oceanic feedbacks involving ice growth and 
  melt and the fresh water balance at the ocean surface (Curry and Webster, 1999; 
  Lewis, 2000) Two feedbacks associated with sea ice are illustrated in <a href="#fig76">Figure 
  7.6</a>. </p>
<p> The Arctic Ocean sea-ice cover evolves from a highly reflective snow covered 
  surface with few openings in May to a decaying sea-ice cover, mottled with melt 
  ponds and interrupted by frequent openings in July. The seasonal changes in 
  mean albedo in the central Arctic, from roughly 0.8 in May to 0.5 in mid-August, 
  are known to within about &plusmn; 0.06 to 0.08. The mean spatial pattern in 
  each summer month features lower albedos in the central Arctic and values 0.1 
  to 0.2 higher along the ice margins, but the spatial evolution of the pattern 
  in any given year is variable. Averages observed at Soviet North Pole drifting 
  stations, from 1950 to 1991, tend to be higher than satellite-based estimates 
  (Marshunova and Mishin, 1994). Albedo depends on wavelength of radiation and 
  on type and thickness of ice; however, ice type and thickness become unimportant 
  if the snow cover exceeds 3 cm water equivalent. The representation of sea-ice 
  albedo in AGCMs may take account of fractional snow cover, specified or predicted 
  sea-ice thickness, ice surface temperature and the fraction of openings and 
  puddles (Barry, 1996). Most models treat visible and near-infrared spectral 
  ranges but there is still a wide variety of snow and ice albedo parametrizations 
  among atmospheric and ocean GCMs. Important new data sets on puddle albedos 
  (Morassutti and LeDrew, 1996) and the temporal evolution of melt pond coverage 
  (Fetterer and Untersteiner, 1998) will enable more realistic albedo formulations 
  to be developed.</p>
<p> Since the SAR, several coupled climate models have incorporated an explicit 
  treatment of openings in sea ice, often in conjunction with ice dynamics. This 
  is typically effected by partitioning a model grid cell into ice-free and ice-covered 
  fractions. However, sub-grid scale variability in ice thickness, not represented 
  in these schemes, can have a potentially important influence on sea-ice mass 
  balance (Schramm et al., 1997), ice/ocean fluxes of heat and fresh water (Holland 
  et al., 1997b) and the sensitivity of sea ice to thermodynamic perturbations 
  (Holland and Curry, 1999). Recent advances in modelling the thickness distribution 
  function make representing sub-grid scale variability, and the accompanying 
  effects, feasible in global climate simulations (Bitz et al., 2001). Other developments 
  since the SAR include updated parametrizations of snow ageing and associated 
  albedo changes and the implementation in some models of a multi-layer formulation 
  of heat conduction through the ice. Snow plays a particularly important role 
  in sea-ice thermodynamics by modifying the surface albedo, reducing thermal 
  conductivity (and hence ice growth rates), and in some locations causing submergence 
  and surface flooding of ice. Considerable effort continues to be devoted to 
  the development and testing of improved physically based parametrizations suitable 
  for use in such models. Recent field experiments, most notably SHEBA (Randall 
  et al., 1998; Perovich et al., 1999), have provided observational data particularly 
  suited to evaluating climate model parametrizations of sea-ice thermodynamic 
  processes and initial attempts at this are underway. Although sea-ice thermodynamic 
  processes are crudely approximated in many coupled climate models (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>, <a href="321.htm#853">Section 8.5.3</a>), it is unclear how these approximations 
  contribute to errors in climate model simulations.</p>
<p> Ice motion is driven by wind and ocean currents and resisted by ice-ocean 
  drag and internal ice stresses. The representation of internal stresses is the 
  primary distinguishing feature among ice dynamics models. Sensitivity experiments 
  with stand alone sea-ice models (Hibler, 1984; Pollard and Thompson, 1994; Arbetter 
  et al., 1997) indicate that inclusion of ice dynamics can alter the modelled 
  sensitivity of the ice cover to climatic perturbations. An assessment of sea-ice 
  dynamic schemes suited to use in global climate models has been undertaken by 
  the ACSYS Sea-Ice Model Intercomparison Project (SIMIP) (Lemke et al., 1997), 
  which has initially focused on the evaluation of sea-ice rheologies (the relationship 
  between internal stresses and deformation). Results are summarised in Kreyscher 
  et al. (1997) and indicate that the elliptical yield curve, viscous-plastic 
  scheme of Hibler (1979) generally outperforms the other schemes evaluated in 
  terms of comparisons to observed ice drift statistics, ice thickness and Fram 
  Strait outflow. Clearly, the effects of ice-related fresh water transports and 
  of other potentially important processes influenced by ice dynamics are not 
  included in climate models which ignore ice motion (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>, <a href="321.htm#853">Section 8.5.3</a>). The effect on climate sensitivity 
  remains to be assessed. Since the SAR, progress has been made at improving the 
  efficiency of numerical sea-ice dynamic models, making them more attractive 
  for use in coupled climate models (Hunke and Dukowicz, 1997; Zhang and Hibler, 
  1997).</p>
