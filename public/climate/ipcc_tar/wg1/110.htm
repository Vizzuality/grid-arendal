<h2>3.5 Observations, Trends and Budgets </h2>
<h3><a name="351"></a>3.5.1 Atmospheric Measurements and Global CO<sub>2</sub> 
  Budgets</h3>
<p>Continuous time-series of highly precise measurements of the atmospheric composition 
  are of central importance to current understanding of the contemporary carbon 
  cycle. CO<sub>2</sub> has been measured at the Mauna Loa and South Pole stations 
  since 1957 (Keeling et al., 1995; <a href="105.htm#fig32">Figure 3.2a</a>), 
  and through a global surface sampling network developed in the 1970s that is 
  becoming progressively more extensive and better inter-calibrated (Conway et 
  al., 1994; Keeling et al., 1995). Associated measurements of <sup><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-s.gif" width="8" height="10">13</sup>C 
  in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> began in 1977 (Francey et al., 1995, Keeling et 
  al., 1995, Trolier et al., 1996). More recently, complementary information has 
  been available from O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (measured as ratios of O<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>, 
  see <a href="107.htm#box35">Box 3.5</a>), which have been regularly measured 
  since the early 1990s (Keeling and Shertz, 1992; Keeling et al., 1993; Bender 
  et al., 1996; Keeling et al., 1996b; Battle et al., 2000; Manning, 2001; <a href="105.htm#fig32">Figure 
  3.2</a>a). O<sub>2</sub> concentration data for the 1980s have been gleaned 
  by two methods: sampling of archived air flasks that were collected during the 
  1980s (Langenfelds et al., 1999), and measuring the air trapped in Antarctic 
  firn (Battle et al., 1996).</p>
<p>In addition to fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, <a href="107.htm#fig33">Figure 
  3.3</a> shows the observed seasonally corrected growth rate of the atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, based on the two longest running atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> recording stations (Keeling and Whorf, 2000). It is evident from 
  this comparison that a part of the anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> has not remained 
  in the atmosphere; in other words, CO<sub>2</sub> has been taken up by the land 
  or the ocean or both. This comparison also shows that there is considerable 
  interannual variability in the total rate of uptake.</p>
<p>O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> measurements are used here to provide observationally-based 
  budgets of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (</p>
<p><a href="097.htm#tab31"> 3.1</a>). CO<sub>2</sub> budgets are presented here 
  (<a href="097.htm#tab31">Table 3.1</a>) for the 1980s (for comparison with previous 
  work; <a href="#tab33">Table 3.3</a>), and for the 1990s. The reported error 
  ranges are based on uncertainties of global fossil fuel emissions, determination 
  of the decadal average changes in the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, 
  and O<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub> ratio; and uncertainties in the assumed O<sub>2</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub> 
  stoichiometric ratios in the combustion of fossil fuels and in photosynthesis 
  and respiration. The error ranges reflect uncertainties of the decadal mean 
  averaged values; they do not reflect interannual variability in annual values, 
  which far exceeds uncertainty in the decadal mean rate of increase, as is further 
  discussed in <a href="111.htm">Section 3.5.2</a>. The salient facts are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>During the 1980s, fossil fuel emissions were on average 5.4 &plusmn; 0.3 
    PgC/yr and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> content increased on average by 3.3 
    &plusmn; 0.1 PgC/yr. Partitioning of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake was estimated based 
    on archived flask O<sub>2</sub> measurements (Langenfelds et al., 1999) for 
    the 1979 to 1997 period, taking the O<sub>2</sub> trend during 1991 to 1997 
    (Battle et al., 2000) into account. The resulting estimate of the ocean-atmosphere 
    flux was -1.9 &plusmn; 0.6 PgC/yr and of the land-atmosphere flux -0.2 &plusmn; 
    0.7 PgC/yr. This partitioning is adopted here in <a href="097.htm#tab31">Table 
    3.1</a>. It is corroborated by independent O<sub>2</sub> measurements in Antarctic 
    firn (Battle et al., 1996). Restricting the analysis to the Battle et al. 
    (1996) data for the 1980 to 1989 period, an ocean-atmosphere flux of -1.8 
    &plusmn; 1.0 PgC/yr and a land-atmosphere flux of -0.4 &plusmn; 1.0 PgC/yr 
    were obtained, i.e., results indistinguishable from the values in <a href="097.htm#tab31">Table 
    3.1</a>.</li>
  <li>Despite a greater emission rate of 6.3 &plusmn; 0.4 PgC/yr (see <a href="109.htm#341">Section 
    3.4.1</a>), the average atmospheric increase during the 1990s was 3.2 &plusmn; 
    0.1 PgC/yr, i.e., about the same as during the 1980s. An exceptionally low 
    rate of increase during the early 1990s was balanced by a high rate during 
    the late 1990s. Based on the longest existing O<sub>2</sub> records from La 
    Jolla (California, USA) and Alert (northern Canada) (Keeling et al., 1996b; 
    Manning, 2001; see <a href="108.htm#fig34">Figure 3.4</a>), the ocean-atmosphere 
    flux during the 1990s was -1.7 &plusmn; 0.5 PgC/yr and the land-atmosphere 
    flux was -1.4 &plusmn; 0.7 PgC/yr.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ocean uptake in the 1980s as estimated from O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> 
  measurements thus agrees with the estimates in the SRRF (Schimel et al., 1995) 
  and the SAR (Schimel et al., 1996) (although these were model-based estimates; 
  this section presents only observationally-based estimates (<a href="#tab33">Table 
  3.3</a>)). Considering the uncertainties, the ocean sink in the 1990s was not 
  significantly different from that in the 1980s. The land-atmosphere flux was 
  close to zero in the 1980s, as also implied by the SAR budget. The land appears 
  to have taken up more carbon during the 1990s than during the 1980s. The causes 
  cannot yet be reliably quantified, but possible mechanisms include a slow down 
  in deforestation (<a href="109.htm#342">Section 3.4.2</a>), and climate variability 
  that resulted in temporarily increased land and/or ocean uptake in the early 
  1990s (<a href="111.htm">Section 3.5.2</a>). These budgets are consistent with 
  information from atmospheric <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-s.gif" width="8" height="10"><sup>13</sup>C 
  measurements (see <a href="108.htm#box36">Box 3.6</a> and <a href="111.htm#tab34">Table 
  3.4</a>) and with budgets presented in the SRLULUCF (Bolin et al. 2000) except 
  that estimated ocean uptake is smaller, and land uptake accordingly larger, 
  than given in the SRLULUCF (see <a href="#tab33">Table 3.3</a>, footnote i).</p>

<p>Several alternative approaches to estimating the ocean-atmosphere and land-atmosphere

  Alternative methods for estimating the global ocean-atmosphere flux, based on 
  surface-water <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> measurements and ocean <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-s.gif" width="8" height="10"><sup>13</sup>C 
  changes (Quay et al., 1992; Tans et al., 1993, Heimann and Maier-Reimer, 1996; 
  Sonnerup et al., 1999), respectively, have yielded a range of -1.5 to -2.8 PgC/yr 
  (for various recent periods). The total anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> added to 
  the ocean since pre-industrial times can also be estimated indirectly using 
  oceanic observations (Gruber et al., 1996). A global value of 107 &plusmn; 27 
  PgC by 1990 can be estimated from the basin-scale values of 40 &plusmn; 9 PgC 
  for the Atlantic in the 1980s (Gruber, 1998), 20 &plusmn; 3 PgC for the Indian 
  Ocean in 1995 (Sabine et al., 1999), and the preliminary value of 45 PgC for 
  the Pacific Ocean in 1990 to 1996 (Feely et al., 1999a) with a large uncertainty 
  of the order of &plusmn; 15 PgC. Assuming that accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  in the ocean follows a curve similar to the (better known) accumulation in the 
  atmosphere, the value for the ocean-atmosphere flux for 1980 to 1989 would be 
  between -1.6 and -2.7 PgC/yr. Although each individual method has large uncertainty, 
  all of these ocean-based measurements give results comparable with the fluxes 
  presented in <a href="097.htm#tab31">Table 3.1</a>. Consideration of model-based 
  estimates of ocean uptake in <a href="111.htm#tab34">Table 3.4</a> is deferred 
  to <a href="112.htm">Section 3.6.2.2</a>.</p>
<p>The land-atmosphere flux based on atmospheric measurements represents the balance 
  of a net land-use flux (currently a positive flux, or carbon source, dominated 
  by tropical deforestation) and a residual component which is, by inference, 
  a negative flux or carbon sink. Using the land-atmosphere flux estimates from 
  <a href="097.htm#tab31">Table 3.1</a>, assuming that land-use change contributed 
  +1.7 PgC/yr to the atmosphere during the 1980s (<a href="109.htm#342">Section 
  3.4.2</a>), then a residual terrestrial flux of -1.9 PgC/yr (i.e., a residual 
  sink of similar magnitude to the total ocean uptake) is required for mass balance. 
  This is the term popularly (and misleadingly) known as the "missing sink". 
  The central estimate of its magnitude agrees with previous analyses, e.g., in 
  the SAR (if "northern forest regrowth" is combined with "residual 
  terrestrial sink" terms in the SAR budget; Schimel et al., 1996) and the 
  SRLULUCF (Bolin et al., 2000) (<a href="#tab33">Table 3.3</a>). The uncertainty 
  around this number is rather large, however, because it compounds the uncertainty 
  in the atmospheric budget with a major uncertainty about changes in land use. 
  Using an error range corresponding to 90% confidence intervals around the atmospheric 
  estimate of -0.2 PgC/yr (i.e., 1.6s, giving confidence intervals of &plusmn;1.1 
  PgC/yr), and taking the range of estimates for CO<sub>2</sub> released due to 
  land-use change during the 1980s from <a href="109.htm#342">Section 3.4.2</a>, 
  the residual terrestrial sink is estimated to range from -3.8 to +0.3 PgC/yr 
  for the 1980s. Model-based analysis of the components of the residual terrestrial 
  sink (<a href="111.htm#tab34">Table 3.4</a>) is discussed in <a href="112.htm">Section 
  3.6.2.2</a>.</p>
