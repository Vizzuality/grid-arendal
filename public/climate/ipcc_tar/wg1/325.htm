      <b>Figure 8.14:</b> Annual mean tropical cooling at the last glacial maximum: 
      comparison between model results and palaeo-data. (Centre panel) simulated 
      surface air temperature changes over land are displayed as a function of 
      surface temperature changes over the oceans, both averaged in the 30&deg;S 
      to 30&deg;N latitudinal band, for all the PMIP simulations: models with 
      prescribed CLIMAP SSTs (circles) and coupled atmosphere-mixed layer ocean 
      models (squares) (from Pinot et al., 1999). Numbers refer to different models: 
      circles, 1: LMD4, 2-5: MRI2, ECHAM3, UGAMP, LMD5 (higher resolution), 6-7: 
      CCSR/NIES1, LMD5, 8: GEN2. Squares : 1: LMD4,2: UGAMP, 3: GEN2, 4: GFDL,

      1-UVIC (Weaver et al., 1998), 2-CLIMBER-2 (Petoukhov et al., 2000). <br>
      The comparison with palaeo-data: (upper panel) over land is with estimates 
      from various pollen data for altitudes below 1,500m (the label "nb 
      data" refers to the number of data points in three different regions 
      corresponding to the temperature change estimate plotted in the abscissa) 
      from (Farrera, et al., 1999); (right panel) the distribution of SST changes 
      estimated from alkenones in the tropics from the Sea Surface Temperature 
      Evolution Mapping Project based on Alkenone Stratigraphy (TEMPUS) (Rosell-Mel&eacute;, 
      et al., 1998) (nb data: same as upper panel, number of data points for each 
      temperature change). Caution: in this figure, model results are averaged 
      over the whole tropical domain and not over proxy-data locations, which 
      may bias the comparison (e.g., Broccoli and Marciniak, 1996). For example, 
      for the pollen data, extreme values are obtained for specific regions: weakest 
      values over the Indonesia-Pacific region and coldest values over South America.

<p><a name="fig814"></a><i>Results from the PMIP experiments</i><br>
  The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate involves large changes in ice sheet extent 
  and height, SSTs, albedo, sea level and CO<sub>2</sub> (200 ppm), but only minor changes 
  in solar radiation. Over the oceans, two sets of experiments have been performed 
  within PMIP using several atmospheric models, either prescribing SSTs estimated 
  from macrofossil transfer functions (CLIMAP, 1981) or computing SSTs from a 
  mixed-layer ocean model. An annual mean global cooling of about -4&deg;C is 
  obtained by all models forced by the Climate: Long-range Investigation, Mapping 
  and Prediction (CLIMAP) SSTs, whereas the range of cooling is larger when using 
  computed SSTs, from -6 to -2&deg;C. This range of 4&deg;C arises both from differences 
  in the simulated radiative forcing associated primarily with different ice albedo 
  values, and from differences in model climate sensitivity (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>, <a href="344.htm#921">Section 9.2.1</a>).</p>
<p>Evaluating the consistency between the simulated climate and that reconstructed 
  from palaeo-data can potentially provide an independent check that model sensitivity 
  is neither too large nor too small. A detailed analysis of a subset of the PMIP 
  models (Taylor et al., 2000), shows that their forcing estimates for the LGM 
  vary from about -4 to -6 Wm<sup>-2</sup> and that their global climate sensitivity, given 
  relatively to a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>, ranges from 3.2 to 3.9&deg;C (assuming that 
  climate sensitivity is independent of the type of forcing, although one model 
  study shows a slightly stronger sensitivity at the LGM than for a CO<sub>2</sub> doubling 
  (Hewitt and Mitchell, 1997)). A direct evaluation of climate sensitivity is, 
  however, very difficult since global temperature changes are poorly known. Hoffert 
  and Covey (1992) estimated a global cooling of -3 &plusmn; 0.6&deg;C from CLIMAP 
  (1981) SST data which would, using the simulated range of forcing, yield to 
  a global climate sensitivity for a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> ranging from 1.4 to 3.2&deg;C, 
  which probably gives a lower estimate of climate sensitivity since CLIMAP SSTs 
  tend to be relatively too warm in the tropics (see below).<br>
</p>
<p>An alternative approach to evaluating climate sensitivity is provided by the 
  detailed comparison of model results with proxy-data over different regions. 
  The amplitude of the tropical cooling at LGM has long been disputed (Rind and 
  Peteet, 1985; Guilderson et al., 1994). Compared to a new synthesis of terrestrial 
  data (Farrera et al., 1999), PMIP simulations with prescribed CLIMAP sea-surface 
  conditions produce land temperatures that are too warm (Pinot et al., 1999) 
  (<a href="#fig814">Figure 8.14</a>), which may be due to too-warm prescribed 
  SSTs, as indicated by new marine data based on alkenone palaeo-thermometry (Rosell-Mel&eacute; 
  et al., 1998) (<a href="#fig814">Figure 8.14</a>). Some mixed-layer ocean models 
  have produced more realistic sea and land temperature cooling (Pinot et al., 
  1999), enhancing our confidence in using such models to estimate climate sensitivity 
  (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="355.htm">Section 9.3.4</a>) (<a href="#fig814">Figure 
  8.14</a>). The same conclusion is derived by Broccoli (2000) when accounting 
  for uncertainties in both the forcing and reconstructed climate from various 
  proxy data. Over Eurasia, all the models simulate a cooling in fairly good agreement 
  with proxy data estimates, except over western Europe (Kageyama et al., 2001), 
  where they all underestimate the winter cooling shown from pollen data (Peyron 
  et al., 1998). However, such simulations have an important caveat since they 
  prescribe present day ocean heat transport whereas changes in the North Atlantic 
  deep water circulation shown by two EMIC models (Ganopolski et al., 1998b; Weaver 
  et al., 1998) and also inferred by palaeo-oceanographic data (e.g., Duplessy 
  et al., 1988) may further decrease temperatures over Europe.</p>
<p><i>Land-surface feedbacks</i><br>
  Vegetation feedbacks at the LGM could have been due to climate-induced shifts 
  in biomes, CO<sub>2</sub>-induced changes in vegetation structure (Jolly and Haxeltine, 
  1997; Street-Perrot et al., 1997; Cowling, 1999), and CO<sub>2</sub>-induced changes in 
  leaf conductance (see <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="291.htm">Section 
  7.4.2</a>). Sensitivity experiments (Crowley and Baum, 1997; Levis et al., 1999) 
  suggest that the first two types dominated. Over much of Eurasia, forests were 
  replaced by tundra or steppe (Prentice et al., 1998) which may have contributed 
  to the observed cooling over Europe (Crowley and Baum, 1997; Kubatzki and Claussen, 
  1998; Levis et al., 1999). Permafrost may also have to be accounted for (Renssen 
  et al., 2000). In the tropics though, there is yet no systematic improvement 
  of the simulated cooling, since the models find large areas of warming due to 
  the simulated deforestation (Crowley and Baum, 1997; Levis et al., 1999). However, 
  land-surface feedbacks may also have affected climate through mineral aerosol 
  (dust) concentrations (Mahowald et al., 1999).</p>
<h4><a name="8553"></a>8.5.5.3 Summary</h4>
<p><i>Mid-Holocene</i><br>
  Through PMIP experiments, it is now well-established that all atmospheric models 
  are able to simulate several robust large-scale features of the Holocene climate 
  but also that they all underestimate these changes. Several complementary simulations 
  have shown that ocean and vegetation processes introduce important feedbacks 
  which are necessary to explain the observed monsoon changes. These results urge 
  for a systematic evaluation of coupled atmosphere-ocean-vegetation models for 
  the mid-Holocene and for an investigation of the impact of vegetation changes, 
  such as climate-induced density and land-use cover changes (see <a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>, <a href="291.htm">Section 7.4.2</a>), on future climate change projections. 
</p>
<p><i>Last Glacial Maximum</i><br>
  The more systematic evaluation of atmosphere alone models conducted within PMIP 
  confirms that the LGM SST as estimated by CLIMAP (1981) need to be revised. 
  Some simulations with atmospheric models coupled to mixed-layer models produce 
  realistic results, especially in the tropics, and enhance our confidence in 
  the estimates of climate sensitivity used in future climate change studies. 
  However, such models neglect changes in ocean heat transport as well as land-surface 
  feedbacks. Moreover, an evaluation of coupled AOGCMs is still needed at the 
  LGM.</p>
