<h3>11.2.4 Interaction of Ice Sheets, Sea Level and the Solid Earth </h3>
<h4><a name="11241"></a>11.2.4.1 Eustasy, isostasy and glacial-interglacial cycles</h4>
<p>On time-scales of 103 to 105 years, the most important processes affecting 
  sea level are those associated with the growth and decay of the ice sheets through 
  glacial-interglacial cycles. These contributions include the effect of changes 
  in ocean volume and the response of the earth to these changes. The latter are 
  the glacio-hydro-isostatic effects: the vertical land movements induced by varying 
  surface loads of ice and water and by the concomitant redistribution of mass 
  within the Earth and oceans. While major melting of the ice sheets ceased by 
  about 6,000 years ago, the isostatic movements remain and will continue into 
  the future because the Earth's viscous response to the load has a time-constant 
  of thousands of years. Observational evidence indicates a complex spatial and 
  temporal pattern of the resulting isostatic sea level change for the past 20,000 
  years. As the geological record is incomplete for most parts of the world, models 
  (constrained by the reliable sea level observations) are required to describe 
  and predict the vertical land movements and changes in ocean area and volume. 
  Relative sea level changes caused by lithospheric processes, associated for 
  example with tectonics and mantle convection, are discussed in <a href="422.htm">Section 
  11.2.6</a>. </p>
<p><a href="418.htm#fig114">Figure 11.4</a> illustrates global-average sea level 
  change over the last 140,000 years. This is a composite record based on oxygen 
  isotope data from Shackleton (1987) and Linsley (1996), constrained by the Huon 
  terrace age-height relationships of Chappell et al. (1996a), the estimate of 
  the LGM sea level by Yokoyama et al. (2000), the late-glacial eustatic sea level 
  function of Fleming et al. (1998), and the timing of the Last Interglacial by 
  Stirling et al. (1998). These fluctuations demonstrate the occurrence of sea 
  level oscillations during a glacial-interglacial cycle that exceed 100 m in 
  magnitude at average rates of up to 10 mm/year and more during periods of decay 
  of the ice sheets and sometimes reaching rates as high as 40 mm/year (Bard et 
  al., 1996) for periods of very rapid ice sheet decay. Current best estimates 
  indicate that the total LGM land-based ice volume exceeded present ice volume 
  by 50 to 53x106 km3 (Yokoyama et al., 2000). </p>
<p>Local sea level changes can depart significantly from this average signal because 
  of the isostatic effects. <a href="419.htm#fig115">Figure 11.5</a> illustrates 
  typical observational results for sea level change since the LGM in regions 
  with no significant land movements other than of a glacio-hydro-isostatic nature. 
  Also shown are model predictions for these localities, illustrating the importance 
  of the isostatic effects. Geophysical models of these isostatic effects are 
  well developed (see reviews by Lambeck and Johnston, 1998; Peltier, 1998). Recent 
  modelling advances have been the development of high-resolution models of the 
  spatial variability of the change including the detailed description of ice 
  loads and of the melt-water load distribution (Mitrovica and Peltier, 1991; 
  Johnston, 1993) and the examination of different assumptions about the physics 
  of the earth (Peltier and Jiang, 1996; Johnston et al., 1997; Kaufmann and Wolf, 
  1999; Tromp and Mitrovica, 1999). </p>

      <p><b>Figure 11.5:</b> Examples of observed relative sea level change (with 
        error bars, right-hand side) and model predictions for four different 
        locations. The model predictions (left-hand side) are for the glacio-hydro-eustatic 
        contributions to the total change (solid line, right hand side). (a) Angermann 
        River, Sweden, near the centre of the former ice sheet over Scandinavia. 
        The principal contribution to the sea level change is the crustal rebound 
        from the ice unloading (curve marked ice, left-hand side) and from the 
        change in ocean volume due to the melting of all Late Pleistocene ice 
        sheets (curve marked esl). The combined predicted effect, including a 
        small water loading term (not shown), is shown by the solid line (right-hand 
        side), together with the observed values. (b) A location near Stirling, 
        Scotland. Here the ice and esl contributions are of comparable magnitude 
        but opposite sign (left-hand side) such that the rate of change of the 
        total contribution changes sign (right-hand side). This result is typical 
        for locations near former ice margins or from near the centres of small 
        ice sheets. (c) The south of England where the isostatic contributions 
        from the water (curve marked water) and ice loads are of similar amplitude 
        but opposite sign. The dominant contribution to sea level change is now 
        the eustatic contribution. This behaviour is characteristic of localities 
        that lie well beyond the ice margins where a peripheral bulge created 
        by the ice load is subsiding as mantle material flows towards the region 
        formerly beneath the ice. (d) A location in Australia where the melt-water 
        load is the dominant cause of isostatic adjustment. Here sea level has 
        been falling for the past 6,000 years. This result is characteristic of 
        continental margin sites far from the former areas of glaciation. (From 
        Lambeck, 1996.)</p>

<p>Information about the changes in ice sheets come from field observations, glaciological 
  modelling, and from the sea level observations themselves. Much of the emphasis 
  of recent work on glacial rebound has focused on improved calculations of ice 
  sheet parameters from sea level data (Peltier, 1998; Johnston and Lambeck, 2000; 
  see also <a href="423.htm#1131">Section 11.3.1</a>) but discrepancies between 
  glaciologically-based ice sheet models and models inferred from rebound data 
  remain, particularly for the time of, and before, the LGM. The majority of ice 
  at this time was contained in the ice sheets of Laurentia and Fennoscandia but 
  their combined estimated volume inferred from the rebound data for these regions 
  (e.g., Nakada and Lambeck, 1988; Tushingham and Peltier, 1991, 1992; Lambeck 
  et al., 1998) is less than the total volume required to explain the sea level 
  change of about 120 to 125 m recorded at low latitude sites (Fairbanks, 1989; 
  Yokoyama et al., 2000). It is currently uncertain how the remainder of the ice 
  was distributed. For instance, estimates of the contribution of Antarctic ice 
  to sea level rise since the time of the LGM range from as much as 37 m (Nakada 
  and Lambeck, 1988) to 6 to 13 m (Bentley, 1999; Huybrechts and Le Meur, 1999). 
  Rebound evidence from the coast of Antarctica indicates that ice volumes have 
  changed substantially since the LGM (Zwartz et al., 1997; Bentley, 1999) but 
  these observations, mostly extending back only to 8,000 years ago, do not provide 
  good constraints on the LGM volumes. New evidence from exposure age dating of 
  moraines and rock surfaces is beginning to provide new constraints on ice thickness 
  in Antarctica (e.g., Stone et al., 1998) but the evidence is not yet sufficient 
  to constrain past volumes of the entire ice sheet.</p>
