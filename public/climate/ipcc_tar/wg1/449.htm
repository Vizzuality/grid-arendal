<h4>12.2.3.2 Climatic response to natural forcing</h4>
<p><i>Response to volcanic forcing</i><br>
  The climate response to several recent volcanic eruptions has been studied in 
  observations and simulations with atmospheric GCMs (e.g., Robock and Mao, 1992, 
  1995; Graf et al., 1996; Hansen et al., 1996; Kelly et al., 1996; Mao and Robock, 
  1998; Kirchner et al., 1999). The stratosphere warms and the annual mean surface 
  and tropospheric temperature decreases during the two to three years following 
  a major volcanic eruption. A simulation incorporating the effects of the Mt. 
  Pinatubo eruption and observed changes in stratospheric ozone in addition to 
  anthropogenic forcing approximately reproduces the observed stratospheric variations 
  (<a href="#fig124">Figure 12.4</a>; Bengtsson et al., 1999). It shows stratospheric 
  warming after the volcanic eruption, superimposed on a long-term cooling trend. 
  Although the surface temperature response in the Northern Hemisphere warm season 
  following a volcanic eruption is dominated by global scale radiative cooling, 
  some models simulate local warming over Eurasia and North America in the cold 
  season due to changes in circulation (e.g., Graf et al., 1996; Kirchner et al., 
  1999). Variability from other sources makes assessment of the observed climate 
  response difficult, particularly as the two most recent volcanic eruptions (Mt. 
  Pinatubo and El Chichon) occurred in El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
  warm years. Simulations with simple models (Bertrand et al., 1999; Crowley and 
  Kim, 1999; Grieser and Schoenwiese, 2001) and AOGCMs (Tett et al., 1999; Stott 
  et al., 2001) produce a small decadal mean cooling in the 1980s and 1990s due 
  to several volcanic eruptions in those decades. Some simulations also produce 
  global warming in the early 20th century as a recovery from a series of strong 
  eruptions around the turn of the 20th century. It is unclear whether such a 
  long-term response is realistic. </p>
<p><i>Response to solar forcing</i><br>
  Since the SAR, there have been new modelling and observational studies on the 
  climate effects of variations in solar irradiance. The surface temperature response 
  to the 11-year cycle is found to be small (e.g., Cubasch et al., 1997; White 
  et al., 1997; North and Stevens, 1998; Crowley and Kim, 1999; Free and Robock, 
  1999). Low-frequency solar variability over the last few hundred years gives 
  a stronger surface temperature response (Cubasch et al., 1997; Drijfhout et 
  al., 1999; Rind et al., 1999; Tett et al., 1999; Stott et al., 2001). Model 
  results show cooling circa 1800 due to the hypothesised solar forcing minimum 
  and some warming in the 20th century, particularly in the early 20th century. 
  Time-dependent experiments produce a global mean warming of 0.2 to 0.5&deg;C 
  in response to the estimated 0.7 Wm<sup>-2</sup> change of solar radiative forcing 
  from the Maunder Minimum to the present (e.g., Lean and Rind, 1998, Crowley 
  and Kim, 1999). </p>
<p>Ozone changes in the Earth's atmosphere caused by the 11-year solar cycle could 
  affect the temperature response in the free atmosphere. A relation between 30 
  hPa geopotential and a solar index has been shown over nearly four solar cycles 
  by Labitzke and van Loon (1997). Van Loon and Shea (1999, 2000) found a related 
  connection between upper to middle tropospheric temperature and a solar index 
  over the last 40 years, which is particularly strong in July and August. Variations 
  in ozone forcing related to the solar cycle may also affect surface temperature 
  via radiative and dynamical processes (see discussion in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>; Haigh, 1999; Shindell et al., 1999, 2001), but observational evidence 
  remains ambiguous (e.g., van Loon and Shea, 2000). The assessment of ozone-related 
  Sun-climate interactions is uncertain as a result of the lack of long-term, 
  reliable observations. This makes it difficult to separate effects of volcanic 
  eruptions and solar forcing on ozone. There has also been speculation that the 
  solar cycle might influence cloudiness and hence surface temperature through 
  cosmic rays (e.g., Svensmark and Friis-Christensen, 1997; Svensmark, 1998). 
  The latter effect is difficult to assess due to limitations in observed data 
  and the shortness of the correlated time-series.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier in <a href="447.htm">Section 12.2.3</a>, differences between 
  the response to solar and greenhouse gas forcings would make it easier to distinguish 
  the climate response to either forcing. However, the spatial response pattern 
  of surface air temperature to an increase in solar forcing was found to be quite 
  similar to that in response to increases in greenhouse gas forcing (e.g., Cubasch 
  et al., 1997). The vertical response to solar forcing (<a href="#fig125">Figure 
  12.5</a>) includes warming throughout most of the troposphere. The response 
  in the stratosphere is small and possibly locally negative, but less so than 
  with greenhouse gas forcing, which gives tropospheric warming and strong stratospheric 
  cooling. The dependence of solar forcing on wavelength and the effect of solar 
  fluctuations on ozone were generally omitted in these simulations. Hence, the 
  conclusion that changes in solar forcing have little effect on large-scale stratospheric 
  temperatures remains tentative.</p>

<p>The different time-histories of the solar and anthropogenic forcing should 
  help to distinguish between the responses. All reconstructions suggest a rise 
  in solar forcing during the early decades of the 20th century with little change 
  on inter-decadal time-scales in the second half. Such a forcing history is unlikely 
  to explain the recent acceleration in surface warming, even if amplified by 
  some unknown feedback mechanism. </p>
