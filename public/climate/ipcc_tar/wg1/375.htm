<h2>10.1 Introduction </h2>
<p>This chapter is a new addition compared with previous IPCC assessment reports. 
  It stems from the increasing need to better understand the processes that determine 
  regional climate and to evaluate regional climate change information for use 
  in impact studies and policy planning. To date, a relatively high level of uncertainty 
  has characterised regional climate change information. This is due to the complexity 
  of the processes that determine regional climate change, which span a wide range 
  of spatial and temporal scales, and to the difficulty in extracting fine-scale 
  regional information from coarse resolution coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General 
  Circulation Models (AOGCMs).</p>
<p>Coupled AOGCMs are the modelling tools traditionally used for generating projections 
  of climatic changes due to anthropogenic forcings. The horizontal atmospheric 
  resolution of present day AOGCMs is still relatively coarse, of the order of 
  300 to 500 km, due to the centennial to millennial time-scales associated with 
  the ocean circulation and the computing requirements that these imply. However, 
  regional climate is often affected by forcings and circulations that occur at 
  the sub-AOGCM horizontal grid scale (e.g., Giorgi and Mearns, 1991). Consequently, 
  AOGCMs cannot explicitly capture the fine-scale structure that characterises 
  climatic variables in many regions of the world and that is needed for impact 
  assessment studies (see <a href="474.htm">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore, a number of techniques have been developed with the goal of enhancing 
  the regional information provided by coupled AOGCMs and providing fine-scale 
  climate information. Here these are referred to as "regionalisation" 
  techniques and are classified into three categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>high resolution and variable resolution Atmosphere GCM (AGCM) experiments; 
  </li>
  <li>nested limited area (or regional) climate models (RCMs); </li>
  <li>empirical/statistical and statistical/dynamical methods. </li>
</ul>
<p> Since the IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR), 
  a substantial development has been achieved in all these areas of research. 
  This chapter has two fundamental objectives. The first is to assess whether 
  the scientific community has been able to increase the confidence that can be 
  placed in the projection of regional climate change caused by anthropogenic 
  forcings since the SAR. The second is to evaluate progress in regional climate 
  research. It is not the purpose of this chapter to provide actual regional climate 
  change information for use in impact work, although the material discussed in 
  this chapter serves most often for the formation of climate change scenarios 
  (see <a href="474.htm">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
<p>The assessment is based on all the different modelling tools that are currently 
  available to obtain regional climate information, and includes: (a) an evaluation 
  of the performance, strengths and weaknesses of different techniques in reproducing 
  present day climate characteristics and in simulating processes of importance 
  for regional climate; and (b) an evaluation of simulations of climate change 
  at the regional scale and associated uncertainties. </p>
<p>Evaluation of present day climate simulations is important because, even though 
  a good simulation of present day climate does not necessarily imply a more accurate 
  simulation of future climate change (see also <a href="474.htm">Chapter 13</a>), 
  confidence in the realism of a model's response to an anomalous climate 
  forcing can be expected to be higher when the model is capable of reproducing 
  observed climate. In addition, interpretation of the response is often facilitated 
  by understanding the behaviour of the model in simulating the current climate. 
  When possible, the capability of models to simulate climates different from 
  the present, such as palaeoclimates, may also provide additional confidence 
  in the predicted climatic changes.</p>
<p>The chapter is organised as follows. In the remainder of this section a summary 
  is first presented of the conclusions reached in the SAR concerning regional 
  climate change. This is followed by a brief discussion of the regional climate 
  problem. <a href="378.htm">Section 10.2</a> examines the principles behind different 
  approaches to the generation of regional climate information. Regional attributes 
  of coupled AOGCM simulations are discussed in <a href="382.htm">Section 10.3</a>. 
  This discussion is important for different reasons: first, because AOGCMs are 
  the starting point in the generation of regional climate change scenarios; second, 
  because many climate impact assessment studies still make use of output from 
  coupled AOGCM experiments without utilising any regionalisation tool; and third 
  because AOGCMs provide the baseline against which to assess the added value 
  of regionalisation techniques. <a href="387.htm">Sections 10.4</a>, <a href="389.htm">10.5</a> 
  and <a href="395.htm">10.6</a> are devoted to the analysis of experiments using 
  high resolution and variable resolution AGCMs, RCMs and empirical/statistical 
  and statistical/dynamical methods, respectively. <a href="401.htm">Section 10.7</a> 
  analyses studies in which different regional-isation techniques have been intercompared 
  and <a href="402.htm">Section 10.8</a> presents a summary assessment.</p>
