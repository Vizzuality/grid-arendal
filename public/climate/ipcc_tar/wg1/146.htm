<h3>4.3 Projections of Future Emissions</h3>
<p>The IPCC SRES (Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al., 2000) developed 40 future 
  scenarios that are characterised by distinctly different levels of population, 
  economic, and technological development. Six of these scenarios were identified 
  as illustrative scenarios and these were used for the analyses presented in 
  this chapter. The SRES scenarios define only the changes in anthropogenic emissions 
  and not the concurrent changes in natural emissions due either to direct human 
  activities such as land-use change or to the indirect impacts of climate change. 
  The annual anthropogenic emissions for all greenhouse gases, NO<sub>x</sub>, 
  CO, VOC and SO<sub>2</sub> (sulphur dioxide) are given in the SRES for the preliminary 
  marker scenarios (Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al., 2000, Appendix VI) and the 
  final marker/illustrative scenarios (Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al., 2000, 
  Appendix VII). Much of these data is also tabulated in <a href="519.htm">Appendix 
  II</a> to this report. There are insufficient data in the published SRES (Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; 
  et al., 2000) to break down the individual contributions to HFCs, PFCs, and 
  SF<sub>6</sub>, but these emissions were supplied by Lead Authors of the SRES 
  (available at <a target="_top" href="http://sres.ciesin.org">sres.ciesin.org</a>) and are 
  also reproduced in this Appendix. The geographic distribution of emissions of 
  the short-lived compounds - NO<sub>x</sub>, CO, VOC, and SO<sub>2</sub> 
   is an important factor in their greenhouse forcing, and the preliminary 
  gridded emissions were likewise supplied by the SRES Lead Authors (Tom Kram 
  and Steven Smith, December 1998) and used in the OxComp model studies. A synopsis 
  of the regional shift in CO and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions projected by 2100 is 
  given in <a href="139.htm#tab46">Tables 4.6</a> and <a href="141.htm#tab48">4.8</a>.</p>
<p>This chapter evaluates the SRES emissions from year 2000 to year 2100 in terms 
  of their impact on the abundances of non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases. A 
  new feature of this report, i.e., use of NO<sub>x</sub>, CO and VOC emissions 
  to project changes in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> and OH, represents a significant 
  advance over the level-of-science in the SAR. The original four preliminary 
  marker scenarios (December 1998) are included here because they have been used 
  in preliminary model studies for the TAR and are designated A1p, A2p, B1p, B2p. 
  In January 1999, these emissions were converted into greenhouse gas abundances 
  using the level-of-science and methodology in the SAR, and the radiative forcings 
  from these greenhouse gas abundances were used in this report for some climate 
  model simulations.</p>
<p>The recently approved six marker/illustrative scenarios (March 2000) are also 
  evaluated and are designated A1B-AIM, A1T-MESSAGE, A1FI-MiniCAM, A2-ASF, B1-IMAGE, 
  B2-MESSAGE (hereafter abbreviated as A1B, A1T, A1FI, A2, B1, B2). For comparison 
  with the previous assessment, we also evaluate the IPCC emissions scenario IS92a 
  used in the SAR; for the full range of IS92 scenarios, see the SAR. An agreed-upon 
  property of all SRES scenarios is that there is no intervention to reduce greenhouse 
  gases; but, in contrast, regional controls on SO<sub>2</sub> emissions across 
  the illustrative SRES scenarios lead to emissions in the last two decades of 
  the century that are well below those of 1990 levels. There appear to be few 
  controls on NO<sub>x</sub>, CO and VOC emissions across all scenarios; however, 
  the large increases in surface O<sub>3</sub> abundances implied by these results 
  may be inconsistent with the SRES storylines that underpin the emissions scenarios. 
  As understanding of the relationship between emissions and tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  abundances improves, particularly on regional scales, more consistent emissions 
  scenarios can be developed. The SRES scenarios project substantial emissions 
  of HFC-134a as in IS92a, but only half as much HFC-125, and no emissions of 
  HFC-152a. The SRES emissions scenarios do include a much larger suite of HFCs 
  plus SF<sub>6</sub> and PFCs, which are not included in IS92a. The emissions 
  of greenhouse gases under the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments (CFCs, HCFCs, 
  halons) have been evaluated in WMO (Madronich and Velders, 1999). This report 
  adopts the single WMO baseline Montreal Protocol Scenario A1 (no relation to 
  SRES A1) for emissions and concentrations of these gases, while the SRES adopted 
  a similar WMO Scenario A3 (maximum production); however, the differences between 
  scenarios in terms of climate forcing is inconsequential. The resulting abundances 
  of greenhouse gases are given in <a href="519.htm">Appendix II</a> and discussed 
  in <a href="152.htm">Section 4.4.5</a>.</p>
