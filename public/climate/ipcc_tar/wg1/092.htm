<h4><a name="2733"></a>2.7.3.3 Droughts and wet spells</h4>
<p>In the SAR, an intensification of the hydrological cycle was projected to occur 
  as the globe warms. One measure of such intensification is to examine whether 
  the frequency of droughts and wet spells are increasing. Karl et al. (1995c) 
  examined the proportion of land areas having a severe drought and a severe moisture 
  surplus over the United States. Dai et al. (1998) extended this analysis to 
  global land areas using the water balance approach of the Palmer Drought Severity 
  Index. Long-term global trends for 1900 to 1995 are relatively small for both 
  severe drought and wet area statistics. However, during the last two to three 
  decades, there have been some increases in the globally combined severe dry 
  and wet areas, resulting from increases in either the dry area, e.g., over the 
  Sahel, eastern Asia and southern Africa or the wet areas, e.g., over the United 
  States and Europe. Most of the increases occurred after 1970. Except for the 
  Sahel, however, the magnitude of dry and wet areas of the recent decades is 
  not unprecedented during this century, but it should be noted that rainfall 
  in the Sahel since the height of the drought has substantially increased. In 
  related work, Frich et al. (2001) found that in much of the mid- and high latitudes, 
  there has been a statistically significant increase in both the number of days 
  with precipitation exceeding 10 mm per day and in the number of consecutive 
  days with precipitation during the second half of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Recent changes in the areas experiencing severe drought or wet spells are closely 
  related to the shift in ENSO towards more warm events since the late 1970s, 
  and coincide with record high global mean temperatures. Dai et al. (1998) found 
  that for a given value of ENSO intensity, the response in areas affected by 
  drought or excessive wetness since the 1970s is more extreme than prior to the 
  1970s, also suggesting an intensification of the hydrological cycle. </p>
<h4><a name="2734"></a>2.7.3.4 Tornadoes, hail and other severe local weather</h4>
<p>Small-scale severe weather phenomena (SCSWP) are primarily characterised by 
  quasi-random temporal and spatial events. These events, in turn, have local 
  and regional impacts, often with significant damage and sometimes loss of life. 
  Tornadoes and thunderstorms and related phenomena such as lightning, hail, wind, 
  dust, water spouts, downpours and cloudbursts belong to this group. In the light 
  of the very strong spatial variability of SCSWP, the density of surface meteorological 
  observing stations is too coarse to measure all such events. Moreover, areally 
  consistent values of SCSWP are inherently elusive. Statistics of relatively 
  rare events are not stable at single stations, observational practices can be 
  subjective and change over time, and the metadata outlining these practices 
  are often not readily available to researchers. For these reasons, monitoring 
  the occurrence of local maxima and minima in smoothed SCSWP series, as well 
  as checking for trends of the same sign for different but related SCSWP (e.g., 
  thunderstorms, hail, cloud bursts), are important for checking inconsistencies. 
  Because of the inherent difficulty in working with these data, there have been 
  relatively few large-scale analyses of changes and variations in these events. 
  Nonetheless, a few new regional analyses have been completed since the SAR. 
</p>
<p>A regional analysis by Dessens (1995) and more recent global analysis by Reeve 
  and Toumi (1999) show that there is a significant interannual correlation between 
  hail and lightning and mean minimum temperature and wet bulb temperatures. Using 
  a three-year data set, Reeve and Toumi (1999) found a statistically significant 
  relationship between lightning frequency and wet bulb temperature. They show 
  that with a 1&deg;C increase in global wet-bulb temperature there is a 40% increase 
  in lightning activity, with larger increases over the Northern Hemisphere land 
  areas (56%). Unfortunately, there are few long-term data sets that have been 
  analysed for lightning and related phenomena such as hail or thunderstorms, 
  to calculate multi-decadal hemispheric or global trends.</p>

<p>A regional analysis assessed the temporal fluctuations and trends in hail-day 
  and thunder-day occurrences during a 100-year period, from 1896 to 1995, derived 
  from carefully screened records of 67 stations distributed across the United 
  States. Upward hail day trends were found in the High Plains-Rockies and the 
  south-east, contrasting with areas with no trend in the northern Midwest and 
  along the East Coast, and with downward trends elsewhere (Changnon and Changnon, 
  2000). The major regions of decrease and increase in hail activity match regions 
  of increased and decreased thunder activity for 1901 to 1980 well (Changnon, 
  1985; Gabriel and Changnon, 1990) and also crop-hail insurance losses (Changnon 
  et al., 1996; Changnon and Changnon, 1997). In general, hail frequency shows 
  a general decrease for most of the United States over the last century, with 
  increases over the High Plains, the region where most of the crop-hail damage 
  occurs in the United States. So, despite an increase in minimum temperature 
  of more than 1&deg;C since 1900 and an increase in tropospheric water vapour 
  over the United States since 1973 (when records are deemed reliable), no systematic 
  increase in hail or thunder days was found.<br>
  In south Moravia, Czech Republic, a decreasing linear trend in the frequency 
  of thunderstorms, hailstorms and heavy rain from 1946 to 1995 was related to 
  a significant decrease in the occurrence of these phenomena during cyclonic 
  situations, when 90% of these phenomena occur in that region (Br&aacute;zdil 
  and Vais, 1997). Temperatures have increased in this area since 1946.</p>
<p>Since 1920, the number of tornadoes reported annually in the United States 
  has increased by an order of magnitude, but this increase reflects greater effectiveness 
  in collecting tornado reports (Doswell and Burgess, 1988; Grazulis, 1993; Grazulis 
  et al., 1998). On the other hand, severe tornadoes are not easily overlooked. 
  Restricting the analysis to very strong and violent tornadoes results in a much 
  different assessment (<a href="#fig238">Figure 2.38</a>) showing little 
  long-term change, though some years like 1974 show a very large number of tornadoes. 
  Furthermore, consideration of the number of days with tornadoes, rather than 
  number of tornadoes, reduces the artificial changes that result from modern, 
  more detailed damage surveys (e.g., Doswell and Burgess, 1988). The data set 
  of "significant" tornado days developed by Grazulis (1993) shows a 
  slow increase in number of days with significant tornadoes from the early 1920s 
  through the 1960s, followed by a decrease since that time. </p>
<h3><a name="274"></a>2.7.4 Summary</h3>
<p>Based on new analyses since the SAR, it is likely that there has been a widespread 
  increase in heavy and extreme precipitation events in regions where total precipitation 
  has increased, e.g., the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. 
  Increases in the mean have often been found to be amplified in the highest precipitation 
  rates total. In some regions, increases in heavy rainfall have been identified 
  where the total precipitation has decreased or remained constant, such as eastern 
  Asia. This is attributed to a decrease in the frequency of precipitation. Fewer 
  areas have been identified where decreases in total annual precipitation have 
  been associated with decreases in the highest precipitation rates, but some 
  have been found. Temperature variability has decreased on intra-seasonal and 
  daily time-scales in limited regional studies. New record high night-time minimum 
  temperatures are lengthening the freeze and frost season in many mid- and high 
  latitude regions. The increase in global temperatures has resulted mainly from 
  a significant reduction in the frequency of much below normal seasonal mean 
  temperatures across much of the globe, with a corresponding smaller increase 
  in the frequency of much above normal temperatures. There is little sign of 
  long-term changes in tropical storm intensity and frequency, but inter-decadal 
  variations are pronounced. Owing to incomplete data and relatively few analyses, 
  we are uncertain as to whether there has been any large-scale, long-term increase 
  in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropical cyclone intensity and frequency though 
  some, sometimes strong, multi-decadal variations and recent increases were identified 
  in several regions. Limited evidence exists for a decrease in cyclone frequency 
  in the Southern Hemisphere since the early 1970s, but there has been a paucity 
  of analyses and data. Recent analyses of changes in severe local weather (tornadoes, 
  thunder days, lightning and hail) in a few selected regions provide no compelling 
  evidence for widespread systematic long-term changes. </p>
