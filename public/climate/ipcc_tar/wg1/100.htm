<h4>3.2.2.2 Effects of changes in land use and land management</h4>
<p>Changes in land use and management affect the amount of carbon in plant biomass 
  and soils. Historical cumulative carbon losses due to changes in land use have 
  been estimated to be 180 to 200 PgC by comparing maps of "natural" 
  vegetation in the absence of human disturbance (derived from ground-based information 
  (Matthews, 1983) or from modelled potential vegetation based on climate (Leemans, 
  1990)) to a map of current vegetation derived from 1987 satellite data (de Fries 
  et al., 1999). Houghton (1999, 2000) estimated emissions of 121 PgC (approximately 
  60% in tropical areas and 40% in temperate areas) for the period 1850 to 1990 
  from statistics on land-use change, and a simple model tracking rates of decomposition 
  from different pools and rates of regrowth on abandoned or reforested land. 
  There was substantial deforestation in temperate areas prior to 1850, and this 
  may be partially reflected in the difference between these two analyses. The 
  estimated land-use emissions during 1850 to 1990 of 121 PgC (Houghton, 1999, 
  2000) can be compared to estimated net terrestrial flux of 39 PgC to the atmosphere 
  over the same period inferred from an atmospheric increase of 144 PgC (Etheridge 
  et al., 1996; Keeling and Whorf, 2000), a release of 212 PgC due to fossil fuel 
  burning (Marland et al., 2000), and a modelled ocean-atmosphere flux of about 
  -107 PgC (Gruber, 1998, Sabine et al., 1999, Feely et al., 1999a). The difference 
  between the net terrestrial flux and estimated land-use change emissions implies 
  a residual land-atmosphere flux of -82 PgC (i.e., a terrestrial sink) over the 
  same period. <a href="#box32">Box 3.2</a> indicates the theoretical upper bounds 
  for additional carbon storage due to land-use change, similar bounds for carbon 
  loss by continuing deforestation, and the implications of these calculations 
  for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

    <td class="box"> 
      <div align="center"><b>Box 3.2: Maximum impacts of reforestation and deforestation 
        on atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. </b> </div>
      <p>Rough upper bounds for the impact of reforestation on atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
        concentration over a century time-scale can be calculated as follows. 
        Cumulative carbon losses to the atmosphere due to land-use change during 
        the past 1 to 2 centuries are estimated as 180 to 200 PgC (de Fries et 
        al., 1999) and cumulative fossil fuel emissions to year 2000 as 280 PgC 
        (Marland et al., 2000), giving cumulative anthropogenic emissions of 480 
        to 500 PgC. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> content has increased by 90 ppm 
        (190 PgC). Approximately 40% of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
        has thus remained in the atmosphere; the rest has been taken up by the 
        land and oceans in roughly equal proportions (see main text). Conversely, 
        if land-use change were completely reversed over the 21st century, a CO<sub>2</sub> 
        reduction of 0.40 x 200 = 80 PgC (about 40 ppm) might be expected. This 
        calculation assumes that future ecosystems will not store more carbon 
        than pre-industrial ecosystems, and that ocean uptake will be less because 
        of lower CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere (see <a href="104.htm#3231">Section 
        3.2.3.1</a>).</p>
      <p>A higher bound can be obtained by assuming that the carbon taken up by 
        the land during the past 1 to 2 centuries, i.e. about half of the carbon 
        taken up by the land and ocean combined, will be retained there. This 
        calculation yields a CO<sub>2</sub> reduction of 0.70 x 200 = 140 PgC 
        (about 70 ppm). These calculations are not greatly influenced by the choice 
        of reference period. Both calculations require the extreme assumption 
        that a large proportion of today's agricultural land is returned 
        to forest.</p>
      <p>The maximum impact of total deforestation can be calculated in a similar 
        way. Depending on different assumptions about vegetation and soil carbon 
        density in different ecosystem types (<a href="099.htm#tab32">Table 3.2</a>) 
        and the proportion of soil carbon lost during deforestation (20 to 50%; 
        IPCC, 1997), complete conversion of forests to climatically equivalent 
        grasslands would add 400 to 800 PgC to the atmosphere. Thus, global deforestation 
        could theoretically add two to four times more CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere 
        than could be subtracted by reforestation of cleared areas.</p>

<p>Land use responds to social and economic pressures to provide food, fuel and 
  wood products, for subsistence use or for export. Land clearing can lead to 
  soil degradation, erosion and leaching of nutrients, and may therefore reduce 
  the subsequent ability of the ecosystem to act as a carbon sink (Taylor and 
  Lloyd, 1992). Ecosystem conservation and management practices can restore, maintain 
  and enlarge carbon stocks (IPCC, 2000a). Fire is important in the carbon budget 
  of some ecosystems (e.g., boreal forests, grasslands, tropical savannas and 
  woodlands) and is affected directly by management and indirectly by land-use 
  change (Apps et al., 1993). Fire is a major short-term source of carbon, but 
  adds to a small longer-term sink (&lt;0.1 PgC/yr) through production of slowly 
  decomposing and inert black carbon. </p>
<p><i>Forests</i><br>
  Deforestation has been responsible for almost 90% of the estimated emissions 
  due to land-use change since 1850, with a 20% decrease of the global forest 
  area (Houghton, 1999). Deforestation appears to be slowing slightly in tropical 
  countries (FAO, 1997; Houghton, 2000), and some deforested areas in Europe and 
  North America have been reforested in recent decades (FAO, 1997). Managed or 
  regenerated forests generally store less carbon than natural forests, even at 
  maturity. New trees take up carbon rapidly, but this slows down towards maturity 
  when forests can be slight sources or sinks (Buchmann and Schulze, 1999). To 
  use land continuously in order to take up carbon, the wood must be harvested 
  and turned into long-lived products and trees must be re-planted. The trees 
  may also be used for biomass energy to avoid future fossil fuel emissions (Hall 
  et al., 2000). Analysis of scenarios for future development show that expanded 
  use of biomass energy could reduce the rate of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increase 
  (IPCC 1996b; Leemans et al., 1996; Edmonds et al., 1996; Ishitani et al., 1996; 
  IPCC, 2000a). IPCC (1996b) estimated that slowing deforestation and promoting 
  natural forest regeneration and afforestation could increase carbon stocks by 
  about 60 to 87 PgC over the period 1995 to 2050, mostly in the tropics (Brown 
  et al., 1996).</p>
<p><i>Savannas and grasslands - fire and grazing</i><br>
  Grasslands and mixed tree-grass systems are vulnerable to subtle environmental 
  and management changes that can lead to shifts in vegetation state (Scholes 
  and Archer, 1997; House and Hall, 2001). Livestock grazing on these lands is 
  the land use with the largest global areal extent (FAO, 1993a). Extensive clearing 
  of trees (for agricultural expansion) has occurred in some areas. In other areas, 
  fire suppression, eradication of indigenous browsers and the introduction of 
  intensive grazing and exotic trees and shrubs have caused an increase in woody 
  plant density known as woody encroachment or tree thickening (Archer et al., 
  2001). This process has been estimated to result in a CO<sub>2</sub> sink of 
  up to 0.17 PgC/yr in the USA during the 1980s (Houghton et al., 1999) and at 
  least 0.03 PgC/yr in Australia (Burrows, 1998). Grassland ecosystems have high 
  root production and store most of their carbon in soils where turnover is relatively 
  slow, allowing the possibility of enhancement through management (e.g., Fisher 
  et al., 1994).</p>
<p><i>Peatlands/wetlands</i><br>
  Peatlands/wetlands are large reserves of carbon, because anaerobic soil conditions 
  and (in northern peatlands) low temperatures reduce decomposition and promote 
  accumulation of organic matter. Total carbon stored in northern peatlands has 
  been estimated as about 455 PgC (Gorham, 1991) with a current uptake rate in 
  extant northern peatlands of 0.07 PgC/yr (Clymo et al., 1998). Anaerobic decomposition 
  releases methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) which has a global warming potential (GWP) 
  about 23 times that of CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>). The 
  balance between CH<sub>4</sub> release and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and release 
  is highly variable and poorly understood. Draining peatlands for agriculture 
  increases total carbon released by decomposition, although less is in the form 
  of CH<sub>4</sub>. Forests grown on drained peatlands may be sources or sinks 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> depending on the balance of decomposition and tree growth 
  (Minkkinen and Laine, 1998).</p>
<p><i>Agricultural land</i><br>
  Conversion of natural vegetation to agriculture is a major source of CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  not only due to losses of plant biomass but also, increased decomposition of 
  soil organic matter caused by disturbance and energy costs of various agricultural 
  practices (e.g., fertilisation and irrigation; Schlesinger, 2000). Conversely, 
  the use of high-yielding plant varieties, fertilisers, irrigation, residue management 
  and reduced tillage can reduce losses and enhance uptake within managed areas 
  (Cole et al., 1996; Blume et al., 1998). These processes have led to an estimated 
  increase of soil carbon in agricultural soils in the USA of 0.14 PgC/yr during 
  the 1980s (Houghton et al., 1999). IPCC (1996b) estimated that appropriate management 
  practices could increase carbon sinks by 0.4 to 0.9 PgC/yr , or a cumulative 
  carbon storage of 24 to 43 PgC over 50 years; energy efficiency improvements 
  and production of energy from dedicated crops and residues would result in a 
  further mitigation potential of 0.3 to 1.4 PgC/yr, or a cumulative carbon storage 
  of 16 to 68 PgC over 50 years (Cole et al., 1996).</p>
<p><i>Scenarios</i><br>
  The IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000a) 
  (hereafter SRLULUCF) derived scenarios of land-use emissions for the period 
  2008 to 2012. It was estimated that a deforestation flux of 1.79 PgC/yr is likely 
  to be offset by reforestation and afforestation flux of -0.20 to -0.58 PgC/yr, 
  yielding a net release of 1.59 to 1.20 PgC/yr (Schlamadinger et al., 2000). 
  The potential for net carbon storage from several "additional activities" 
  such as improved land management and other land-use changes was estimated to 
  amount to a global land-atmosphere flux in the region of -1.3 PgC/yr in 2010 
  and -2.5 PgC/yr in 2040, not including wood products and bioenergy (Sampson 
  et al., 2000).</p>
