<h4>8.5.1.2 Tropospheric climate</h4>
<h4>8.5.1.2.1 Surface quantities</h4>
<p>The SAR's evaluation of coupled-model simulations focused on surface air temperature, 
  sea level pressure and precipitation. The SAR concluded that model simulations 
  of surface air temperature were "very similar" to observations. Simulations 
  of the other two quantities were found to be less accurate but nevertheless 
  reasonable: the SAR concluded that coupled models represented "the observed 
  large-scale geographical distribution" of sea level pressure "rather well", 
  and that they were "generally successful in simulating the broad-scale structure 
  of the observed precipitation".</p>

<p><a href="#fig82">Figures 8.2</a> and <a href="#fig83">8.3</a> (reproduced from 
  Lambert and Boer, 2001) update this assessment using coupled model output from 
  the CMIP1 database. For each quantity, the figures show both a map of the average 
  over all fifteen models ("model mean") and zonal means for all individual fifteen 
  models. Lambert and Boer (2001) demonstrate that the model mean exhibits good 
  agreement with observations, often better than any of the individual models. 
  Inspection of these portions of the figures reaffirms the SAR conclusions summarised 
  above. The errors in model-mean surface air temperature rarely exceed 1&deg;C 
  over the oceans and 5&deg;C over the continents; precipitation and sea level 
  pressure errors are relatively greater but the magnitudes and patterns of these 
  quantities are recognisably similar to observations. The bottom portion of <a href="#fig82">Figure 
  8.2</a> shows maps of the model mean taken separately over all flux adjusted 
  models (lower left) and all non-flux adjusted models (lower right). Flux adjusted 
  models are generally more similar to the observations - and to each other - 
  than are non-flux adjusted models. However, errors in the non-flux adjusted 
  model mean are not grossly larger than errors in the flux adjusted model mean 
  (except in polar regions). This result from the "inter-model" CMIP database 
  suggests that the SAR was correct in anticipating that the need for flux adjustments 
  would diminish as coupled models improve. It is reinforced by "intra-model ensembles", 
  i.e., by the experience that improvements to individual models can reduce the 
  need for flux adjustments (e.g., Boville and Gent, 1998).</p>

<p><a name="fig84"></a>The foregoing points are made in a more quantitative fashion 
  by <a href="#fig84">Figures 8.4</a> to <a href="#fig86">8.6</a> (reproduced 
  from Covey et al., 2000b). <a href="#fig84">Figure 8.4</a> gives the standard 
  deviation and correlation with observations of the total spatial and temporal 
  variability (including the seasonal cycle, but omitting the global mean) for 
  surface air temperature, sea level pressure and precipitation in the CMIP2 simulations. 
  The standard deviation is normalised to its observed value and the correlation 
  ranges from zero along an upward vertical line to unity along a line pointing 
  to the right. Consequently, the observed behaviour of the climate is represented 
  by a point on the horizontal axis a unit distance from the origin. In this coordinate 
  system, the linear distance between each model's point and the "observed" point 
  is proportional to the r.m.s. model error (Taylor, 2000; see also Box 8.1). 
  Surface air temperature is particularly well simulated, with nearly all models 
  closely matching the observed magnitude of variance and exhibiting a correlation 
  &gt; 0.95 with the observations. Sea level pressure and precipitation are simulated 
  less well, but the simulated variance is still within &plusmn;25% of observed 
  and the correlation with observations is noticeably positive (about 0.7 to 0.8 
  for sea level pressure and 0.4 to 0.6 for precipitation).</p>
<p>Observational uncertainties are indicated in <a href="#fig84">Figure 8.4</a> 
  by including extra observational data sets as additional points, as if they 
  were models. These additional points exhibit greater agreement with the baseline 
  observations as expected. It is noteworthy, however, that the differences between 
  alternate sets of observations are not much smaller than the differences between 
  models and the baseline observations. This result implies that in terms of variance 
  and space-time pattern correlation, the models nearly agree with observations 
  to within the observational uncertainty.</p>
<p><a href="#fig85">Figures 8.5</a> and <a href="#fig86">8.6</a> show global mean 
  errors ("bias") and root mean square (r.m.s.) errors normalised by standard 
  deviations for surface air temperature and precipitation in CMIP2 model simulations. 
  Both the r.m.s. errors and the background standard deviations are calculated 
  from the full spatial and temporal variability of the fields. The r.m.s. errors 
  are divided into a number of components such as zonal mean vs. deviations and 
  annual mean vs. seasonal cycle. For nearly all models the r.m.s. error in zonal- 
  and annual-mean surface air temperature is small compared with its natural variability. 
  The errors in the other components of surface air temperature, and in zonal 
  mean precipitation, are relatively larger but generally not excessive compared 
  with natural variability.</p>
<p>In <a href="#fig85">Figures 8.5</a> and <a href="#fig86">8.6</a>, models are 
  divided into flux adjusted and non-flux adjusted classes. Slight differences 
  between the two may be discerned, but it is not obvious that these are statistically 
  significant if the two classes are considered as random samples from a large 
  population of potential climate models. The same conclusion was reached in a 
  detailed study of the seasonal cycle of surface air temperature in the CMIP 
  models (Covey et al., 2000a). (That study, however, also noted that many of 
  the non-flux adjusted models suffered from unrealistic "climate drift" up to 
  about 1&deg;C / century in global mean surface temperature.) The relatively 
  small differences between flux adjusted and non-flux adjusted models noted above 
  suggest that flux adjustments could be - indeed, are being - dispensed with 
  at acceptable cost in many climate models, at least for the century time-scale 
  integrations of interest in detecting and predicting anthropogenic climate change. 
  In recent models that omit flux adjustment, the representation of atmospheric 
  fields has in some cases actually improved, compared with older, flux-adjusted 
  versions of the models. Examples include the HadCM3 model and the CSM 1.0 model. 
  In CSM 1.0, atmospheric temperature, precipitation and atmospheric circulation 
  are close to values simulated when the atmospheric component of the CSM 1.0 
  model is driven by observed sea surface temperatures (Boville and Hurrell, 1998).</p>

      <p><b>Box 8.1:</b> Taylor diagrams</p>
      <p>To quantify how well models simulate an observed climate field, it is 
        useful to rely on three non-dimensional statistics: the ratio of the variances 
        of the two fields:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><img src="images/gamma-s.gif" width="8" height="10"><sup>2</sup> = 
          <img src="images/delta-s.gif" width="8" height="10"><sup>2</sup><sub>mod</sub>/<img src="images/delta-s.gif" width="8" height="10"><sup>2</sup><sub>obs</sub></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>the correlation between the two fields (<i>R</i>, which is computed after 
        removing the overall means), and the r.m.s difference between the two 
        fields (<i>E</i>, which is normalised by the standard deviation of the 
        observed field). The ratio of variance indicates the relative amplitude 
        of the simulated and observed variations, whereas the correlation indicates 
        whether the fields have similar patterns of variation, regardless of amplitude. 
        The normalised r.m.s error can be resolved into a part due to differences 
        in the overall means (<i>E<sub>0</sub></i>), and a part due to errors 
        in the pattern of variations (<i>E'</i>).</p>
      <p>These statistics provide complementary, but not completely independent, 
        information. Often the overall differences in means (E<sub>0</sub>) is 
        reported separately from the three pattern statistics (<i>E'</i>, <img src="images/gamma-s.gif" width="8" height="10">, 
        and <i>R</i>), but they are in fact related by the following equation:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><i>E'</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>E</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>E</i><sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> 
          = 1 + <img src="images/gamma-s.gif" width="8" height="10"><sup>2</sup>-2<img src="images/gamma-s.gif" width="8" height="10"><i>R</i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This relationship makes it possible to display the three pattern statistics 
        on a two-dimensional plot like that in <a href="#fig84">Figure 8.4</a>. 
        The plot is constructed based on the Law of Cosines. The observed field 
        is represented by a point at unit distance from the origin along the abscissa. 
        All other points, which represent simulated fields, are positioned such 
        that <img src="images/gamma-s.gif" width="8" height="10"> is the radial 
        distance from the origin, <i>R</i> is the cosine of the azimuthal angle, 
        and <i>E'</i> is the distance to the observed point. When the distance 
        to the point representing the observed field is relatively short, good 
        agreement is found between the simulated and observed fields. In the limit 
        of perfect agreement (which is, however, generally not achievable because 
        there are fundamental limits to the predictability of climate), <i>E'</i> 
        would approach zero, and <img src="images/gamma-s.gif" width="8" height="10"> 
        and <i>R</i> would approach unity.</p>
