<h3>4.1.2 Atmospheric Chemistry and Feedbacks<br>
</h3>
<p>All greenhouse gases except CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O are removed from 
  the atmosphere primarily by chemical processes within the atmosphere. Greenhouse 
  gases containing one or more H atoms (e.g., CH<sub>4</sub>, HFCs and HCFCs), 
  as well as other pollutants, are removed primarily by the reaction with hydroxyl 
  radicals (OH). This removal takes place in the troposphere, the lowermost part 
  of the atmosphere, ranging from the surface up to 7 to 16 km depending on latitude 
  and season and containing 80% of the mass of the atmosphere. The greenhouse 
  gases N<sub>2</sub>O, PFCs, SF<sub>6</sub>, CFCs and halons do not react with 
  OH in the troposphere. These gases are destroyed in the stratosphere or above, 
  mainly by solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) at short wavelengths (&lt;240 nm), 
  and are long-lived. Because of the time required to transport these gases to 
  the region of chemical loss, they have a minimum lifetime of about 20 years. 
  CO<sub>2</sub> is practically inert in the atmosphere and does not directly 
  influence the chemistry, but it has a small in situ source from the oxidation 
  of CH<sub>4</sub>, CO and VOC.</p>
<p>Tropospheric OH abundances depend on abundances of NO<sub>x</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, 
  CO, VOC, O<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O plus the amount of solar UV (&gt;300 
  nm) that reaches the troposphere. As a consequence, OH varies widely with geographical 
  location, time of day, and season. Likewise the local loss rates of all those 
  gases reacting with OH also vary. Because of its dependence on CH<sub>4</sub> 
  and other pollutants, tropospheric OH is expected to have changed since the 
  pre-industrial era and to change again for future emission scenarios. For some 
  of these gases other removal processes, such as photolysis or surface uptake, 
  are also important; and the total sink of the gas is obtained by integrating 
  over all such processes. The chemistry of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> is closely 
  tied to that of OH, and its abundance also varies with changing precursor emissions. 
  The chemistry of the troposphere is also directly influenced by the stratospheric 
  burden of O<sub>3</sub>, climatic changes in temperature (T) and humidity (H<sub>2</sub>O), 
  as well as by interactions between tropospheric aerosols and trace gases. Such 
  couplings provide a "feedback" between the climate change induced by increasing 
  greenhouse gases and the concentration of these gases. Another feedback, internal 
  to the chemistry, is the impact of CH<sub>4</sub> on OH and hence its own loss. 
  These feedbacks are expected to be important for tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  and OH. Such chemistry-chemistry or climate-chemistry coupling has been listed 
  under "indirect effects" in the SAR (Prather et al., 1995; Schimel et al., 1996). 
</p>
<p>This chapter uses 3-D chemistry-transport models (CTMs) to integrate the varying 
  chemical processes over global conditions, to estimate their significance, and 
  to translate the emission scenarios into abundance changes in the greenhouse 
  gases CH<sub>4</sub>, HFCs, and O<sub>3</sub>. An extensive modelling exercise 
  called OxComp (tropospheric oxidant model comparison) - involving model 
  comparisons, sensitivity studies, and investigation of the IPCC SRES scenarios 
   was organised to support this report.</p>
<p>Stratospheric circulation and distribution of O<sub>3</sub> control the transport 
  of the long-lived greenhouse gases to regions of photochemical loss as well 
  as the penetration of solar UV into the atmosphere. At the same time, many of 
  these gases (e.g., N<sub>2</sub>O and CFCs) supply ozone-depleting radicals 
  (e.g., nitric oxide (NO) and Cl) to the stratosphere, providing a feedback between 
  the gas and its loss rate. Another consequence of the observed stratospheric 
  ozone depletion is that tropospheric photochemical activity is expected to have 
  increased, altering tropospheric OH and O<sub>3</sub>. Climate change in the 
  21st century, including the radiative cooling of the stratosphere by increased 
  levels of CO<sub>2</sub>, is expected to alter stratospheric circulation and 
  O<sub>3</sub>, and, hence, the global mean loss rates of the long-lived gases. 
  Some of these effects are discussed in WMO (1999) and are briefly considered 
  here.</p>
<p>The biosphere's response to global change will impact the atmospheric 
  composition of the 21st century. The anticipated changes in climate (e.g., temperature, 
  precipitation) and in chemistry will alter ecosystems and thus the "natural", 
  background emissions of trace gases. There is accumulating evidence that increased 
  N deposition (the result of NO<sub>x</sub> and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) emissions) 
  and elevated surface O<sub>3</sub> abundances have opposite influences on plant 
  CO<sub>2</sub> uptake: O<sub>3</sub> (&gt;40 ppb) inhibits CO<sub>2</sub> uptake; 
  while N deposition enhances it up to a threshold, above which the effects are 
  detrimental. In addition, the increased N availability from atmospheric deposition 
  and direct fertilisation accelerates the emission of N-containing trace gases 
  (NO, N<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub>) and CH<sub>4</sub>, as well as altering 
  species diversity and biospheric functioning. These complex interactions represent 
  a chemistry-biosphere feedback that may alter greenhouse forcing. </p>
