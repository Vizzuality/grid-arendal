<p> A special concern are possible reductions of the Atlantic THC caused by warming 
  and freshening of high latitude surface water associated with global warming 
  (Manabe and Stouffer, 1993; Stocker and Schmittner, 1997). Both the high latitude 
  warming and an enhanced poleward transport of moisture in the atmosphere contribute 
  to the reduction of water density in the formation regions of NADW. However, 
  it is not clear which of these two processes is the more important (Dixon et 
  al., 1999; Mikolajewicz and Voss, 2000). Most coupled climate models indicate 
  a reduction in the meridional overturning circulation, a measure of the THC, 
  from 10 to 50% in response to increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere 
  for the next 100 years (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>). A notable exception 
  is one coupled climate model (Latif et al., 2000), but this result must be corroborated 
  with other comprehensive climate models that are capable of resolving well both 
  ENSO and the THC processes. </p>
<p> A less likely, but not impossible, scenario is a complete shut-down of the 
  THC, which would have a dramatic impact on the climate around the North Atlantic. 
  A complete shut-down requires the passing of a critical threshold and may be 
  an irreversible process because of multiple equilibria of the THC. Multiple 
  equilibria have been reported by the entire ocean and climate model hierarchy 
  ranging from simple models (Stommel, 1961; Stocker and Wright, 1991), uncoupled 
  OGCMs (Bryan, 1986; Marotzke and Willebrand, 1991; Weaver and Hughes, 1994) 
  to fully coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs (Manabe and Stouffer, 1988). The structure 
  of the oceanic reorganisation beyond the threshold, simulated in models of different 
  complexity, is robust: the Atlantic THC ceases (Manabe and Stouffer, 1993; Schmittner 
  and Stocker, 1999), which leads to a reduction in the meridional heat transport 
  in the Atlantic, and hence a regional cooling counteracts the temperature increase. 
  It depends on the model's climate sensitivity whether the combined effect 
  results in a net warming or net cooling in the regions most affected by the 
  meridional heat transport of the Atlantic THC. In addition, such reorganisations 
  would have a profound impact on the north-south distribution of the warming 
  and precipitation (Schiller et al., 1997), on sea level rise (see <a href="408.htm">Chapter 
  11</a>, <a href="434.htm#11541">Section 11.5.4.1</a>; Knutti and Stocker, 2000), 
  and on the biogeochemical cycles (see <a href="095.htm">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="120.htm">Section 
  3.7.2</a>; Joos et al., 1999).</p>
<p> Model simulations with different climate models have found a complete shut-down 
  of the THC when the global atmospheric temperature increases by an amount between 
  3.7 and 7.4&deg;C (Manabe and Stouffer, 1993; Stocker and Schmittner, 1997; 
  Dixon et al., 1999). It is however not clear whether the climate system possesses 
  a threshold in this range, as the values depend on the response of the hydrological 
  cycle to the warming and the parametrizations of mixing processes in the ocean. 
  Furthermore, the rate of temperature increase also determines stability: the 
  THC is less stable under faster perturbations (Stocker and Schmittner, 1997; 
  Stouffer and Manabe, 1999). Model simulations further suggest that the proximity 
  to the threshold depends on the strength of the THC: a weaker THC is more likely 
  to shut down completely (Tziperman, 2000). </p>
<p> In summary, a reduction of the Atlantic THC is a likely response to increased 
  greenhouse gas forcing based on currently available model simulations. Uncertainties 
  in the model simulation of the hydrological cycle, the vertical transport of 
  heat in the ocean interior and the parametrization of deep water formation processes, 
  however, translate directly to uncertainties regarding the stability and future 
  evolution of the THC. While none of the current projections with coupled models 
  exhibit a complete shut-down of the THC during the next 100 years (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a>, <a href="357.htm#fig921">Figure 9.21</a>), one cannot exclude the possibility 
  that such thresholds lie in the range of projected climate changes. Furthermore, 
  since natural variability in the climate system is not fully predictable, it 
  follows that there are inherent limitations to predicting transitions and thresholds.</p>
