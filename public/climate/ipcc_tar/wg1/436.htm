<h1>11.6 Reducing the Uncertainties in Future Estimates of Sea Level Change</h1>
<p>It is valuable to note that the reduction in the uncertainty of estimation 
  of the long-term ice sheet imbalance reported in <a href="423.htm#1131">Sections 
  11.3.1</a> and <a href="428.htm">11.4</a> came from indirect constraints and 
  the synthesis of information of different types. Such syntheses offer promise 
  for further progress.</p>
<h3><a name="1161"></a>11.6.1 Observations of Current Rates of Global-averaged 
  and Regional Sea Level Change</h3>
<p><a href="424.htm#11321">Sections 11.3.2.1</a> and <a href="428.htm">11.4</a> 
  reveal significant uncertainty in the analysis of 20th century sea level change. 
  Also, we have little knowledge of the regional pattern of sea level change. 
  Observational determination of such a pattern would be a powerful test of the 
  coupled models required for projections of globally averaged and regional sea 
  level rise. Requirements for reducing uncertainties include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A global tide gauge network (the &#145;GLOSS Core Network') (IOC, 1997) 
    for measuring relative change. </li>
  <li>A programme of measurements of vertical land movements at gauge sites by 
    means of GPS (Global Positioning System), DORIS Beacons and/or absolute gravity 
    meters (Neilan et al., 1998).</li>
  <li>Improved models of postglacial rebound.</li>
  <li>A reanalysis of the historical record, including allowing for the impact 
    of variable atmospheric forcing. </li>
  <li>A subset of mostly island tide gauge stations devoted to ongoing calibration 
    of altimetric sea level measurements (Mitchum, 1998). </li>
  <li>An ongoing high-quality (TOPEX/POSEIDON class) satellite radar altimeter 
    mission (Koblinsky et al., 1992) and careful control of biases within a mission 
    and between missions.</li>
  <li>Space gravity missions to estimate the absolute sea surface topography (Balmino 
    et al., 1996, 1999) and its temporal changes, to separate thermal expansion 
    from an increase in ocean mass from melting of glaciers and ice sheets (NASA, 
    1996, NRC, 1997) and changes in terrestrial storage. </li>
</ul>
<p>For assessment of possible changes to the severity of storm surges, analyses 
  of historical storm surge data in conjunction with meteorological analyses are 
  needed for the world's coastlines, including especially vulnerable regions. 
</p>
<h3><a name="1162"></a>11.6.2 Ocean Processes</h3>
<p>Requirements for improved projections of ocean thermal expansion include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Global estimates of ocean thermal expansion through analysis of the historical 
    data archive of ocean observations and a programme of new observations, including 
    profiling floats measuring temperature and salinity and limited sets of full-depth 
    repeat oceanographic sections and time-series stations.</li>
  <li>Testing of the ability of AOGCMs to reproduce the observed three-dimensional 
    and time-varying patterns of ocean thermal expansion. </li>
  <li>An active programme of ocean and atmosphere model improvement, with a particular 
    focus on the representation of processes which transport heat into and within 
    the interior of the ocean.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="1163"></a>11.6.3 Glaciers and Ice Caps </h3>
<p>Requirements for improved projections of glacier contributions include (see 
  also Haeberli et al., 1998): </p>
<ul>
  <li>A strategy of worldwide glacier monitoring, including the application of 
    remote sensing techniques (laser altimetry, aerial photography, high-resolution 
    satellite visible and infrared imagery e.g. from ASTER and Landsat).</li>
  <li>A limited number of detailed and long-term mass balance measurements on 
    glaciers in different climatic regions of the world, with an emphasis on winter 
    and summer balances in order to provide a more direct link with meteorological 
    observations.</li>
  <li>Development of energy balance and dynamical models for more detailed quantitative 
    analysis of glacier geometry changes with respect to mass balance and climate 
    change.</li>
  <li>Glacier inventory data to determine the distribution of glacier parameters 
    such as area and area-altitude relations, so that mass balance, glacier dynamics 
    and runoff/sea level rise models can be more realistically framed. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="1164"></a>11.6.4 Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Continued observations with satellite altimeters, including the upcoming 
    satellite laser altimeter on ICESat and the radar interferometer on CRYOSAT. 
    Measurements should be continued for at least 15 years (with intercalibration 
    between missions) to establish the climate sensitivities of the mass balance 
    and decadal-scale trends. </li>
  <li>Satellite radar altimetry and synthetic aperture radar interferometry (ERS-1, 
    ERS-2 and Radarsat) for detailed topography, changes in ice sheet volume and 
    surface velocity of the ice sheets (Mohr et al., 1998; Joughin et al., 1999), 
    as well as short-term variability in their flow (Joughin et al., 1996a,b) 
    and grounding line position (Rignot, 1998a,b,c).</li>
  <li>Determination of the Earth's time-variant gravity field by the Gravity 
    Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite flown concurrently with 
    ICESat to provide an additional constraint on the contemporary mass imbalances 
    (Bentley and Wahr, 1998). This could provide estimates of sea level change 
    to an accuracy of &plusmn;0.35 mm/yr.</li>
  <li>Geological observations of sea level change during recent millennia combined 
    with improved postglacial rebound models and palaeoclimatic and palaeoglaciological 
    studies to learn what changes have occurred in the past.</li>
  <li>Further analysis of Earth rotational parameters in combination with sea 
    level measurements. </li>
  <li>Improved estimates of surface mass balance (including its spatial and temporal 
    variability) from in situ observations, accumulation rates inferred from atmospheric 
    moisture budgets and improved estimates of the rate of iceberg calving and 
    the melt-water flux.</li>
  <li>Improved calculation of the surface mass balance within ice sheet models 
    or by atmospheric models, with attention to modelling of changes in sea-ice 
    concentration because of the consequent effect on moisture transports and 
    accumulation.</li>
  <li>Improved understanding and modelling of the dynamics of ice sheets, ice 
    streams and ice shelves (requiring combined studies using glaciological, oceanographic 
    and satellite observations), including the physics of iceberg calving.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="1165"></a>11.6.5 Surface and Ground Water Storage</h3>
<p>Surface and ground water storage changes are thought to be having a significant 
  impact on sea level, but their contribution is very uncertain (<a href="425.htm#tab1110">Table 
  11.10</a>, <a href="424.htm#fig119">Figure 11.9</a>), and could be either positive 
  or negative. They may become more important in the future, as a result of changes 
  related not only to climate, but also to societal decisions that are beyond 
  the scope of this scientific assessment. There are several general issues in 
  climate-related aspects: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A more thorough investigative search of historical records could provide 
    addition information on ground water mining, and storage in reservoirs. </li>
  <li>Accurate satellite measurements of variations in the Earth's gravity 
    (Herring, 1998) to detect changes in land water storage due to water-table 
    variations and impoundments.</li>
  <li>A better understanding of seepage losses beneath reservoirs and in irrigation 
    is required.</li>
  <li>A unified systems approach is needed to trace the path of water more accurately 
    through the atmosphere, hydrologic, and biosphere sub-systems, and to account 
    for various feedbacks (including the use of GCMs and improved hydrologic models).</li>
  <li>Satellite remote sensing offers useful technology for monitoring the global 
    hydrologic budget. A cumulative volume estimate for the many small reservoirs 
    might be possible using high-resolution radar data, targeted ground studies 
    and a classification of land use classes from satellite data and also of changes 
    in deforestation and other land-use transformations (Koster et al., 1999).</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="1166"></a>11.6.6 Summary</h3>
<p>Sea level change involves many components of the climate system and thus requires 
  a broad range of research activities. A more detailed discussion of the requirements 
  is given in the report of the recent IGBP/GAIM Workshop on sea level changes 
  (Sahagian and Zerbini, 1999). We recognise that it is important to assign probabilities 
  to projections, but this requires a more critical and quantitative assessment 
  of model uncertainties than is possible at present.</p>
