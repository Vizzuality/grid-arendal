<h4>14.2.4.2 The terrestrial system </h4>
<p>The metabolic processes that are responsible for plant growth and maintenance 
  and the microbial turnover, which is associated with dead organic matter decomposition, 
  control the cycle of carbon, nutrients, and water through plants and soil on 
  both rapid and intermediate time-scales. Moreover, these cycles affect the energy 
  balance and provide key controls over biogenic trace gas production. Looking 
  at the carbon fixation-organic material decomposition as a linked process, one 
  sees that some of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis and incorporated into plant 
  tissue is perhaps delayed from returning to the atmosphere until it is oxidised 
  by decomposition or fire. This slower carbon loop through the terrestrial component 
  of the carbon cycle affects the rate of growth of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  and, in its shorter term expression, imposes a seasonal cycle on that trend 
  (<a href="105.htm#fig32">Chapter 3, Figure 3.2a</a>). The structure of terrestrial 
  ecosystems, which respond on even longer time-scales, is determined by the integrated 
  response to changes in climate and to the intermediate time-scale carbon-nutrient 
  machinery. The loop is closed back to the climate system, since it is the structure 
  of ecosystems, including species composition, that largely sets the terrestrial 
  boundary condition of the climate in terms of surface roughness, albedo, and 
  latent heat exchange (see <a href="099.htm">Chapter 3, Section 3.2.2</a>).<br>
</p>
<p>Modelling interactions between terrestrial and atmospheric systems requires 
  coupling successional models to biogeochemical models and physiological models 
  that describe the exchange of water and energy between vegetation and the atmosphere 
  at fine time-scales. At each step toward longer time-scales, the climate system 
  integrates the more fine-scaled processes and applies feedbacks onto the terrestrial 
  biome. At the finest time-scales, the influence of temperature, radiation, humidity 
  and winds has a dramatic effect on the ability of plants to transpire. On longer 
  time-scales, integrated weather patterns regulate biological processes such 
  as the timing of leaf emergence or excision, uptake of nitrogen by autotrophs, 
  and rates of organic soil decay and turnover of inorganic nitrogen. The effect 
  of climate at the annual or interannual scale defines the net gain or loss of 
  carbon by the biota, its water status for the subsequent growing season, and 
  even its ability to survive.<br>
</p>
<p>As the temporal scale is extended, the development of dynamic vegetation models, 
  which respond to climate and human land use as well as other changes, is a central 
  issue. These models must not only treat successional dynamics, but also ecosystem 
  redistribution. The recovery of natural vegetation in abandoned areas depends 
  upon the intensity and length of the agricultural activity and the amount of 
  soil organic matter on the site at the time of abandonment. To simulate the 
  biogeochemistry of secondary vegetation, models must capture patterns of plant 
  growth during secondary succession. These patterns depend substantially on the 
  nutrient pools inherited from the previous stage. The changes in hydrology need 
  also to be considered, since plants that experience water stress will alter 
  the allocation of carbon to allocate more carbon to roots. Processes such as 
  reproduction, establishment, and light competition have been added to such models, 
  interactively with the carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles. Disturbance regimes 
  such as fire are also incorporated into the models, and these disturbances are 
  essential in order to treat successfully competitive dynamics and hence future 
  patterns of ecosystem. It should be noted also that these forcing terms themselves 
  might be altered by the changes that result from changes in the terrestrial 
  system.<br>
</p>
<p>This coupling across time-scales represents a significant challenge. Immediate 
  challenges that confront models of the terrestrial-atmosphere system include 
  exchanges of carbon and water between the atmosphere and land, and the terrestrial 
  sources and sinks of trace gases. <br>
</p>
<p>Prognostic models of terrestrial carbon cycle and terrestrial ecosystem processes 
  are central for any consideration of the effects of environmental change and 
  analysis of mitigation strategies; moreover, these demands will become even 
  more significant as countries begin to adopt carbon emission targets. At present, 
  several rather complex models are being developed to account for the ecophysiological 
  and biophysical processes, which determine the spatial and temporal features 
  of primary production and respiration (see <a href="115.htm">Chapter 3, Sections 
  3.6.2</a> and <a href="119.htm#371">3.7.1</a>). Despite recent progress in developing 
  and evaluating terrestrial biosphere models, several crucial questions remain 
  open. For example, current models are highly inconsistent in the way they treat 
  the response of Net Primary Production (NPP) to climate variability and climate 
  change - even though this response is fundamental to predictions of the 
  total terrestrial carbon balance in a changing climate. Models also differ significantly 
  in the degree of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation they allow, and the extent to which CO<sub>2</sub> responses 
  are constrained by nutrient availability; the extent to which CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  affect the global distribution of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathways; and the 
  impacts of climate, CO<sub>2</sub> and land management on the tree-grass balance. These 
  are all areas where modelling capability is limited by lack of knowledge, thus 
  making it crucially important to expand observational and experimental research. 
  Important areas are interannual variability in terrestrial fluxes and the interplay 
  of warming, management, and CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment responses at the ecosystem scale. 
  Moreover, these issues must be far better resolved if there is to be an adequate 
  verification scheme to confirm national performance in meeting targets for CO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions. (See <a href="115.htm">Chapter 3, Sections 3.6.2</a> and <a href="119.htm#371">3.7.1</a>.)<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, while progress will be made on modelling terrestrial processes, more 
  integrative studies are also needed wherein terrestrial systems are coupled 
  with models of the physical atmosphere and eventually with the chemical atmosphere 
  as well. </p>
