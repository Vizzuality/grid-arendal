<h4>14.2.3.2 Thermohaline circulation</h4>
<p>In the oceanic component of climate models, ocean current patterns are represented 
  significantly better in models of higher resolution in large part because ocean 
  current systems (including mesoscale eddies), ocean variability (including ENSO 
  events), and the thermohaline circulation (and other vertical mixing processes) 
  and topography which greatly influence the ocean circulation, can be better 
  represented. Improved resolution and understanding of the important facets of 
  coupling in both atmosphere and ocean components of global climate models have 
  also been proven to reduce flux imbalance problems arising in the coupling of 
  the oceanic and the atmospheric components. However, it must still be noted 
  that uncertainties associated with clouds still cause problems in the computation 
  of surface fluxes. With the availability of computer power, a central impediment 
  to the gain in model accuracy is being reduced; however, there is still a long 
  way to go before many of the important processes are explicitly resolved by 
  the numerical grid. In addition there continues to be a necessary "concomitant" 
  increase in resources for process studies and for diagnosis as computer power 
  increases. It must still be remembered that the system presents chaotic characteristics 
  that can only be evaluated through an analysis of ensembles statistics, and 
  these ensembles must be generated by running suites of models under varied initial 
  and forcing conditions. <br>
</p>
<p>In a few model calculations, a large rate of increase in the radiative forcing 
  of the planet is enough to cause the ocean's global thermohaline circulation 
  almost to disappear, though in some experiments it reappears given sufficiently 
  long integration times (see <a href="287.htm#737">Chapter 7, Section 7.3.7</a> 
  and <a href="357.htm">Chapter 9, 9.3.4.3</a>). This circulation is important 
  because in the present climate it is responsible for a large portion of the 
  heat transport from the tropics to higher latitudes, and it plays an important 
  role in the oceanic uptake of CO<sub>2</sub>. Palaeo-oceanographic investigations suggest 
  that aspects of longer-term climate change are associated with changes in the 
  ocean's thermohaline circulation. We need appropriate observations of the 
  thermohaline circulation, and its natural variations, to compare with model 
  simulations (see <a href="357.htm">Chapter 9, Section 9.3.4.3</a>; see also 
  <a href="298.htm">Chapter 7, Section 7.6</a> and <a href="320.htm">Chapter 8, 
  Section 8.5.2.2</a>).<br>
</p>
<p>The coming decade will be important for ocean circulation in the context of 
  climate. A particularly exciting development is the potential for assimilating 
  synoptic ocean observations (e.g., the US/French ocean TOPography satellite 
  altimeter EXperiment (TOPEX-POSEIDON) and Argo) into ocean general circulation 
  models. Key questions, such as how well do the ocean models capture the inferred 
  heat flux or tracer distributions, are central to the use of these models in 
  climate studies. The effort of comparing models with data, as the direct path 
  for model rejection and model improvement, is central to increasing our understanding 
  of the system.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="14233"></a>14.2.3.3 Arctic sea ice<br>
</h4>
<p> There is increasing evidence that there is a decline in the extent and thickness 
  of Arctic sea ice in the summer that appears to be connected with the observed 
  recent Arctic warming (see <a href="062.htm">Chapter 2, Section 2.2.5.2</a>; 
  <a href="293.htm#box71">Chapter 7, Box 7.1</a>, and <a href="321.htm#853">Chapter 
  8, Section 8.5.3</a>; see also <a href="295.htm">Chapter 7, Section 7.5.2</a> 
  for a general discussion on the role of sea ice in the climate system as well 
  as recent advances in modelling sea ice). <br>
</p>
<p>It is not known whether these changes reflect anthropogenic warming transmitted 
  either from the atmosphere or the ocean or whether they mostly reflect a major 
  mode of multi-decadal variability. Some of this pattern of warming has been 
  attributed to recent trends in the Arctic Oscillation (see <a href="083.htm">Section 
  2.6</a>); however, how the anthropogenic signal is imprinted on the natural 
  patterns of climate variability remains a central question. What does seem clear 
  is that the changes in Arctic sea ice are significant, and there is a positive 
  feedback that could be triggered by declines in sea-ice extent through changes 
  in the planetary albedo. If the Arctic shifted from being a bright summer object 
  to a less bright summer object, then this would be an important positive feedback 
  on a warming pattern (see the "left loop" in <a href="295.htm#fig76">Chapter 
  7, Figure 7.6</a>). <br>
</p>
<p>In addition to these recently available observations, there have been several 
  models (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (Australia) 
  (CSIRO) - Gordon and O'Farrell, 1997; Department of Energy (USA) Parallel 
  Climate Model (DOE PCM) - Washington et al., 2000; National Center for 
  Atmospheric Research (USA) Climate System Model (NCAR CSM) - Weatherly 
  et al., 1998; see also <a href="295.htm">Chapter 7, Section 7.5.2</a> and <a href="321.htm#853">Chapter 
  8, Section 8.5.3</a>) that have improved their sea ice representation since 
  the SAR. These improvements include simulation of open water within the ice 
  pack, snow cover upon the ice, and sea ice dynamics. The incorporation of sophisticated 
  sea ice components in climate models provides a framework for testing and calibrating 
  these models with observations. Further, as the formulation of sea ice dynamics 
  becomes more realistic, the validity of spatial patterns of the simulated wind 
  stress over the polar oceans is becoming an issue in Atmosphere-Ocean General 
  Circulation Model (AOGCM) simulations. Hence, improvements, such as the above-mentioned 
  data, in the observational database will become increasingly relevant to climate 
  model development. In addition, satellite observations have recently been used 
  to determine sea-ice velocity (Emery et al., 1997) and melt season (Smith, 1998). 
  <br>
</p>
<p>New field programmes are under way with the explicit goal of improving the 
  accuracy of model simulations of sea ice and polar climate (see Randall et al., 
  1998, for a review). In order to improve model representations and validation, 
  it will be essential to enhance the observations over the Arctic including ocean, 
  atmosphere, and sea ice state variables. This will help provide more reliable 
  projections for a region of the world where significant changes are expected. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>The refinement of sea-ice models along with enhanced observations reduces the 
  uncertainty associated with ice processes. (See <a href="293.htm">Chapter 7, 
  Section 7.5</a> and <a href="321.htm#853">Chapter 8, Section 8.5.3</a> for more 
  discussion and evaluation of model performance; for some open issues see <a href="370.htm">Chapter 
  9, Section 9.4</a>.) This progress is important, and efforts are needed to expand 
  upon it and, as stated, to improve the observational basis significantly. </p>
