<h3>12.4.1 Simple Indices and Time-series Methods </h3>
<p>An index used in many climate change detection studies is global mean surface 
  temperature, either as estimated from the instrumental record of the last 140 
  years, or from palaeo-reconstructions. Some studies of the characteristics of 
  the global mean and its relationship to forcing indices are assessed in <a href="447.htm">Section 
  12.2.3</a>. Here we consider briefly some additional studies that examine the 
  spatial structure of observed trends or use more sophisticated time-series analysis 
  techniques to characterise the behaviour of global, hemispheric and zonal mean 
  temperatures. </p>

      forced simulations over larger regions than the control simulations.</td>

<p><i><a name="fig129"></a>Spatial patterns of trends in surface temperature</i><br>
  An extension of the analysis of global mean temperature is to compare the spatial 
  structure of observed trends (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="057.htm">Section 
  2.2.2.4</a>) with those simulated by models in coupled control simulations. 
  Knutson et al. (2000) examined observed 1949 to 1997 surface temperature trends 
  and found that over about half the globe they are significantly larger than 
  expected from natural low-frequency internal variability as simulated in long 
  control simulations with the GFDL model (<a href="#fig129">Figure 12.9</a>). 
  A similar result was obtained by Boer et al. (2000a) using 1900 to 1995 trends. 
  The level of agreement between observed and simulated trends increases substantially 
  in both studies when observations are compared with simulations that incorporate 
  transient greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosol forcing (compare <a href="#fig129">Figure 
  12.9c</a> with <a href="#fig129">Figure 12.9d</a>, see also <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>, <a href="327.htm#fig818">Figure 8.18</a>). While there are areas, such 
  as the extra-tropical Pacific and North Atlantic Ocean, where the GFDL model 
  warms significantly more than has been observed, the anthropogenic climate change 
  simulations do provide a plausible explanation of temperature trends over the 
  last century over large areas of the globe. Delworth and Knutson (2000) find 
  that one in five of their anthropogenic climate change simulations showed a 
  similar evolution of global mean surface temperature over the 20th century to 
  that observed, with strong warming, particularly in the high latitude North 
  Atlantic, in the first half of the century. This would suggest that the combination 
  of anthropogenic forcing and internal variability may be sufficient to account 
  for the observed early-century warming (as suggested by, e.g., Hegerl et al., 
  1996), although other recent studies have suggested that natural forcing may 
  also have contributed to the early century warming (see <a href="460.htm">Section 
  12.4.3</a>).</p>
<p><i>Correlation structures in surface temperature</i><br>
  Another extension is to examine the lagged and cross-correlation structure of 
  observed and simulated hemispheric mean temperature as in Wigley et al., (1998a). 
  They find large differences between the observed and model correlation structure 
  that can be explained by accounting for the combined influences of anthropogenic 
  and solar forcing and internal variability in the observations. Solar forcing 
  alone is not found to be a satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy between 
  the correlation structures of the observed and simulated temperatures. Karoly 
  and Braganza (2001) also examined the correlation structure of surface air temperature 
  variations. They used several simple indices, including the land-ocean contrast, 
  the meridional gradient, and the magnitude of the seasonal cycle, to describe 
  global climate variations and showed that for natural variations, they contain 
  information independent of the global mean temperature. They found that the 
  observed trends in these indices over the last 40 years are unlikely to have 
  occurred due to natural climate variations and that they are consistent with 
  model simulations of anthropogenic climate change.</p>
<p><i>Statistical models of time-series</i><br>
  Further extensions involve the use of statistical "models" of global, 
  hemispheric and regional temperature time-series. Note however, that the stochastic 
  models used in these time-series studies are generally not built from physical 
  principles and are thus not as strongly constrained by our knowledge of the 
  physical climate system as climate models. All these studies depend on inferring 
  the statistical properties of the time-series from an assumed noise model with 
  parameters estimated from the residuals. As such, the conclusions depend on 
  the appropriateness or otherwise of the noise model.</p>
<p>Tol and de Vos (1998), using a Bayesian approach, fit a hierarchy of time-series 
  models to global mean near-surface temperature. They find that there is a robust 
  statistical relationship between atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and global mean temperature 
  and that natural variability is unlikely to be an explanation for the observed 
  temperature change of the past century. Tol and Vellinga (1998) further conclude 
  that solar variation is also an unlikely explanation. Zheng and Basher (1999) 
  use similar time-series models and show that deterministic trends are detectable 
  over a large part of the globe. Walter et al. (1998), using neural network models, 
  estimate that the warming during the past century due to greenhouse gas increases 
  is 0.9 to 1.3&deg;C and that the counter-balancing cooling due to sulphate aerosols 
  is 0.2 to 0.4&deg;C. Similar results are obtained with a multiple regression 
  model (Sch&ouml;nwiese et al., 1997). Kaufmann and Stern (1997) examine the 
  lagged-covariance structure of hemispheric mean temperature and find it consistent 
  with unequal anthropogenic aerosol forcing in the two hemispheres. Smith et 
  al. (2001), using similar bivariate time-series models, find that the evidence 
  for causality becomes weak when the effects of ENSO are taken into account. 
  Bivariate time-series models of hemispheric mean temperature that account for 
  box-diffusion estimates of the response to anthropogenic and solar forcing 
  are found to fit the observations significantly better than competing statistical 
  models. All of these studies draw conclusions that are consistent with those 
  of earlier trend detection studies (as described in the SAR).</p>
<p>In summary, despite various caveats in each individual result, time-series 
  studies suggest that natural signals and internal variability alone are unlikely 
  to explain the instrumental record, and that an anthropogenic component is required 
  to explain changes in the most recent four or five decades.</p>
