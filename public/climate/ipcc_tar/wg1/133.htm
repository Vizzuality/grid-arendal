<h3>4.1.4 Atmospheric Lifetimes and Time-Scales</h3>
<p>The global atmospheric lifetime (yr) characterises the time required to turn 
  over the global atmospheric burden. It is defined as the burden (Tg) divided 
  by the mean global sink (Tg/yr) for a gas in steady state (i.e., with unchanging 
  burden). This quantity was defined as both "lifetime" and "turnover 
  time" in the SAR (see also Bolin and Rodhe, 1973). Lifetimes calculated 
  in this manner are listed in Table 4.1. A corollary of this definition is that, 
  when in steady state (i.e., source strength = sink strength), the atmospheric 
  burden of a gas equals the product of its lifetime and its emissions. A further 
  corollary is that the integrated atmospheric abundance following a single emission 
  is equal to the product of its steady-state lifetime for that emission pattern 
  and the amount emitted (Prather, 1996). This latter, new result since the SAR 
  supports the market-basket approach of aggregating the direct emissions of different 
  greenhouse gases with a GWP (Global Warming Potential) weighting.</p>
<p>The atmospheric lifetime is basically a scale factor relating (i) constant 
  emissions (Tg/yr) to a steady-state burden (Tg), or (ii) an emission pulse (Tg) 
  to the time-integrated burden of that pulse (Tg/yr). The lifetime is often additionally 
  assumed to be a constant, independent of the sources; and it is also taken to 
  represent the decay time (e-fold) of a perturbation. These latter assumptions 
  apply rigorously only for a gas whose local chemical lifetime is constant in 
  space and time, such as for the noble gas radon, whose lifetime is fixed by 
  the rate of its radioactive decay. In such a case the mean atmospheric lifetime 
  equals the local lifetime: the lifetime that relates source strength to global 
  burden is exactly the decay time of a perturbation.</p>
<p>This general applicability of the atmospheric lifetime breaks down for those 
  greenhouse gases and pollutants whose chemical losses vary in space and time. 
  NO<sub>x</sub>, for instance, has a local lifetime of &lt;1 day in the lower 
  troposphere, but &gt;5 days in the upper troposphere; and both times are less 
  than the time required for vertical mixing of the troposphere. In this case 
  emission of NO<sub>x</sub> into the upper troposphere will produce a larger 
  atmospheric burden than the same emission into the lower troposphere. Consequently, 
  the definition of the atmospheric lifetime of NO<sub>x</sub> is not unique and 
  depends on the location (and season) of its emissions. The same is true for 
  any gas whose local lifetime is variable and on average shorter than about 0.5 
  year, i.e., the decay time of a north-south difference between hemispheres representing 
  one of the longer time-scales for tropospheric mixing. The majority of greenhouse 
  gases considered here have atmospheric lifetimes greater than 2 years, much 
  longer than tropospheric mixing times; and hence their lifetimes are not significantly 
  altered by the location of sources within the troposphere. When lifetimes are 
  reported for gases in <a href="130.htm#tab41a">Table 4.1</a>, it is assumed 
  that the gases are uniformly mixed throughout the troposphere. This assumption 
  is unlikely for gases with lifetimes &lt;1 year, and reported values must be 
  viewed only as approximations.</p>
<p>Some gases have chemical feedbacks that change their lifetimes. For example, 
  the increasing CH<sub>4</sub> abundance leads to a longer lifetime for CH<sub>4</sub> 
  (Prather et al., 1995; Schimel et al., 1996). A chemical feedback with opposite 
  effect has been identified for N<sub>2</sub>O where a greater N<sub>2</sub>O 
  burden leads to increases in stratospheric NO<sub>x</sub> which in turn depletes 
  mid-stratospheric ozone. This ozone loss enhances the UV, and as a consequence 
  N<sub>2</sub>O is photolysed more rapidly (Prather, 1998). Such feedbacks cause 
  the time-scale of a perturbation, henceforth called perturbation lifetime (<i>PT</i>), 
  to differ from the global atmospheric lifetime (<i>LT</i>). In the limit of 
  small perturbations, the relation between the perturbation lifetime of a gas 
  and its global atmospheric lifetime can be derived from a simple budget relationship 
  as <i>PT = LT / (1 - s)</i>, where the sensitivity coefficient <i>s = &eth;ln(LT) 
  / &eth;ln(B)</i> and B = burden. Without a feedback on lifetime, <i>s = 0</i>, 
  and <i>PT</i> is identical to <i>LT</i>. The product, <i>PT</i> times a sustained 
  change in emission, gives the resulting change in the burden. The ratio of <i>PT/LT</i> 
  adopted here for CH<sub>4</sub>, 1.4, is based on recent model studies (see 
  <a href="148.htm#44">Section 4.4</a>) and is consistent with the SAR results. 
</p>
<p>To evaluate the total greenhouse effect of a given gas molecule, one needs 
  to know, first, how long it remains in the atmosphere and, second, how it interacts 
  chemically with other molecules. This effect is calculated by injecting a pulse 
  of that gas (e.g., 1 Tg) into the atmosphere and watching the added abundance 
  decay as simulated in a CTM. This decay is represented by a sum of exponential 
  functions, each with its own decay time. These exponential functions are the 
  chemical modes of the linearised chemistry-transport equations of the CTM (Prather, 
  1996). In the case of a CH<sub>4</sub> addition, the longest-lived mode has 
  an e-fold time of 12 years, close to the perturbation lifetime (<i>PT</i>) of 
  CH<sub>4</sub>, and carries most of the added burden. (This e-fold time was 
  called the adjustment time in the SAR.) In the case of a CO addition, this same 
  mode is also excited, but at a reduced amplitude (Prather, 1996; Daniel and 
  Solomon, 1998). The pulse of added CO, by causing the concentration of OH to 
  decrease and thus the lifetime of CH<sub>4</sub> to increase temporarily, causes 
  a build-up of CH<sub>4</sub> while the added burden of CO persists. After the 
  initial period of a few months defined by the CO photochemical lifetime, this 
  built-up CH<sub>4</sub> then decays in the same manner as would a direct pulse 
  of CH<sub>4</sub>. Similarly, an addition of NO<sub>x</sub> (e.g., from aviation; 
  see Isaksen and Jackman, 1999) will excite this mode, but with a negative amplitude. 
  Thus, changes in the emissions of short-lived gases can generate long-lived 
  perturbations as shown in 3-D CTMs (Wild and Prather, 2000; Derwent et al., 
  2001). Changes in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> accompany the CH<sub>4</sub> decay 
  on a 12 year time-scale as an inherent component of this mode, a key example 
  of chemical coupling in the troposphere. Thus, any chemically reactive gas, 
  whether a greenhouse gas or not, will produce some level of indirect greenhouse 
  effect through its impact on atmospheric chemistry.</p>
