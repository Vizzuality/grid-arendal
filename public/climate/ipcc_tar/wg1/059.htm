<h3><a name="223"></a>2.2.3 Temperature of the Upper Air </h3>
<p><i>Uncertainties in discerning changes</i><br>
  Several measuring systems are available to estimate the temperature variations 
  and trends of the air above the surface, though all contain significant time-varying 
  biases as outlined below.</p>
<p><i>Weather balloons </i><br>
  The longest data sets of upper air temperature are derived from instruments 
  carried aloft by balloons (radiosondes). Changes in balloon instrumentation 
  and data processing over the years have been pervasive, however, resulting in 
  discontinuities in these temperature records (Gaffen, 1994; Parker and Cox, 
  1995; Parker et al., 1997). Gaffen et al. (2000b) attempted to identify these 
  biases by using statistical tests to determine "change-points" - 
  sudden temperature shifts not likely to be of natural origin (e.g., instrument 
  changes). However, they found that alternative methods for identifying change 
  points yield different trend estimates and that the analysis was hampered by 
  the lack of complete documentation of instrument and data processing changes 
  for many stations. This study, however, only analysed change points in the time-series 
  of individual stations in isolation. Another technique, used successfully with 
  surface data, relies on differences produced from comparisons among several 
  stations in close proximity. In addition, Santer et al. (1999) noted that temperature 
  trends estimated from radiosonde data sets are sensitive to how temperature 
  shifts are dealt with, which stations are utilised, and the method used for 
  areal averaging.<br>
  <br>
  Worldwide temperatures from the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) data (Christy 
  et al., 2000) have been available from the beginning of 1979 for intercomparison 
  studies. Parker et al. (1997) used the lower-stratospheric and lower-tropospheric 
  MSU products to adjust monthly radiosonde reports for stations in Australia 
  and New Zealand at times when instrumental or data-processing changes were documented. 
  Some individual stratospheric corrections were as much as 3&deg;C due to radiosonde 
  instrument changes. The main disadvantage of the Parker et al. technique is 
  that the raw MSU record has time-varying biases which must first be estimated 
  and eliminated (Christy et al., 2000).<br>
  <br>
  Gaffen et al. (2000b) compared trends for 1959 to 1995, calculated using linear 
  regression, for twenty-two stations with nearly complete data records at levels 
  between 850 and 30 hPa. Each of these stations is included in two data sets 
  created since the SAR: (a) monthly mean temperatures reported by the weather 
  balloon station operators (Parker et al., 1997; CLIMAT TEMP data) and (b) monthly 
  mean temperatures calculated from archived daily weather balloon releases (Eskridge 
  et al., 1995; CARDS data). Decadal trends at individual sites differed randomly 
  between the two data sets by typically 0.1&deg;C/decade, with the largest differences 
  at highest altitudes. In a few cases the differences were larger and statistically 
  significant at the 1% level. The discrepancies were sometimes traceable to time-of-observation 
  differences of the data used to calculate the averages.</p>
<p>The analysis of trends requires long station data records with minimal missing 
  data. The records for 180 stations in the combined Global Climate Observing 
  System Upper Air Network (GUAN) and the Angell (1988, 2000) network do not generally 
  meet this standard, as only 74 of the GUAN stations, for instance, have at least 
  85% of tropospheric monthly means available for 1958 to 1998. In the lower stratosphere 
  (up to 30 hPa), only twenty-two stations meet this requirement (Gaffen et al., 
  2000b). These deficiencies present the dilemma of using either relatively small 
  networks of stations with adequate data (the Southern Hemisphere, in particular, 
  is poorly sampled) or larger networks with poorer quality data (adding uncertainty 
  to the resulting trend estimates).</p>
<p>Characteristics, such as spatial coverage, of each data 
  set derived from the weather balloon data are different. For example, Sterin 
  (1999) used data from over 800 stations from the CARDS and telecommunicated 
  data sets, with only gross spatial and temporal consistency checks. The data 
  were objectively interpolated to all unobserved regions, introducing extra uncertainty. 
  Parker et al. (1997) placed CLIMAT TEMP data into 5&deg; latitude x 10&deg; 
  longitude grid boxes from about 400 sites, leaving unobserved boxes missing. 
  Further data sets were created employing limited spatial interpolation and bias-adjustments, 
  but uncertainties related to spatial under-sampling remain (Hurrell et al., 
  2000). Angell (1988) placed observations from 63 stations into seven broad latitudinal 
  bands, calculated the simple average for each band and produced global, hemispheric 
  and zonal mean anomalies.</p>
<p><i>Satellites</i><br>
  Radiosondes measure temperatures at discrete levels, but satellite instruments 
  observe the intensity of radiation from deep atmospheric layers. The advantage 
  of satellites is the essentially uniform, global, coverage. The three temperature 
  products that are commonly available from MSU are: the low to mid-troposphere 
  (MSU 2LT, surface to about 8 km), mid-troposphere (MSU 2, surface to about 18 
  km, hence including some stratospheric emissions) and the lower stratosphere 
  (MSU 4, 15 to 23 km, hence including some tropical tropospheric emissions) (Christy 
  et al., 2000). No other data, such as from radiosondes, are used to construct 
  these MSU data sets. It is important to note that the troposphere and stratosphere 
  are two distinct layers of the atmosphere with substantially different temperature 
  variations and trends. The altitude of the troposphere/stratosphere boundary 
  varies with latitude, being about 16 to 17 km in the tropics but only 8 to 10 
  km at high latitudes.</p>
<p>Since the SAR, several issues have emerged regarding MSU temperatures. Mo (1995) 
  reported that for one of the longest-lived satellites (NOAA-12, 1991 to 1998) 
  the non-linear calibration coefficients were erroneous, affecting MSU 2 and 
  MSU 2LT. Wentz and Schabel (1998) discovered that satellite orbit decay introduces 
  gradual, spurious cooling in MSU 2LT. Christy et al. (1998, 2000) found that 
  instrument responses often differ between the laboratory assessments and on-orbit 
  performance, requiring further corrections. Additional adjustments were also 
  made by recalculating and removing spurious temperature trends due to diurnal 
  effects induced by the east-west drift of the spacecraft (Christy et al., 2000). 
  The magnitude of the spurious trends (1979 to 1998) removed from version D compared 
  to version C were: orbit decay, -0.11; instrument response, +0.04 and diurnal 
  drift, +0.03&deg;C/decade.</p>

<p>Version D of the MSU data is used in <a href="#fig212">Figure 2.12</a>. 
  The SAR presented version B that for the low to mid-troposphere indicated a 
  global trend about 0.05&deg;C/decade more negative than version D (for 1979 
  to 1995). Quite separately, Prabhakara et al. (1998) generated a version of 
  MSU 2 without corrections for satellite drift or instrument body effects, in 
  many ways similar to MSU 2 version A of Spencer and Christy (1992a, 1992b).</p>
<p>The Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) detects the intensity of thermal emissions 
  and measures deep layer temperatures at altitudes above 20 km (Nash and Forrester, 
  1986). As with the MSU products, adjustments are required for radiometer biases, 
  diurnal sampling and orbital drift (Chanin and Ramaswamy, 1999).</p>
<p><i>Rocketsondes and lidar</i><br>
  Data sets generated from rocketsondes have been updated (Golitsyn et al., 1996; 
  Lysenko et al., 1997), providing temperature information to as high as 75 km. 
  Important difficulties arise with these data due to different types of instrumentation, 
  tidal cycles (amplitude 2&deg;C) and to assumed corrections for aerodynamic 
  heating. The last set of adjustments has the most significant impact on trends. 
  The approximately 11-year solar cycle forces a temperature perturbation of &gt;1&deg;C 
  in the mid- to upper stratosphere (30 to 50 km). Keckhut et al. (1999) and Dunkerton 
  et al. (1998) created a quality-controlled data set of these measurements, which 
  is used in Chanin and Ramaswamy (1999). The very limited number of launch sites 
  leads to some uncertainty in deduced temperatures, and most launches were terminated 
  in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>Rayleigh lidar measurements began in 1979 at the Haute Provence Observatory 
  in southern France and have spread to locations around the world. Lidar techniques 
  generate the vertical profile of temperature from 30 to 90 km, providing absolute 
  temperatures within 2.5&deg;C accuracy. Chanin and Ramaswamy (1999) have combined 
  MSU 4, SSU, radiosonde, lidar and rocketsonde data to estimate 5-km thick layer 
  temperature variations for altitudes of 15 to 50 km, generally limited to the 
  Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes.</p>
<p><i>Reanalyses</i><br>
  The principle of reanalysis is to use observations in the data assimilation 
  scheme of a fixed global weather forecasting model to create a dynamically consistent 
  set of historical atmospheric analyses (Kalnay et al., 1996). Within the assimilation 
  scheme, potentially errant data are amended or excluded using comparisons with 
  neighbours and/or calculated conditions. However, small, time-dependent biases 
  in the observations, of magnitudes important for climate change, are virtually 
  impossible to detect in the model, even in areas of adequate in situ data. Furthermore, 
  in areas with few in situ data the reanalyses are often affected by inadequate 
  model physics or satellite data for which time-varying biases have not been 
  removed. <br>
  <br>
  Though interannual variability is reproduced well, known discontinuities in 
  reanalysed data sets indicate that further research is required to reduce time-dependent 
  errors to a level suitable for climate change studies (Basist and Chelliah, 
  1997; Hurrell and Trenberth, 1998; Santer et al., 1999, 2000; Stendel et al., 
  2000). It is anticipated that future assessments of climate change will utilise 
  reanalysis products to which substantial improvements will have been made. Data 
  from the NCEP reanalysis are included below for comparison purposes, but longer-term 
  stratospheric trends from NCEP are especially suspect due to a large shift in 
  temperature when satellite data were incorporated for the first time in 1978 
  (Santer et al., 1999).<br>
