<h3>3.5.4 Terrestrial Biomass Inventories </h3>
<p>Inventory studies measure changes in carbon stocks over large areas, and can 
  thus provide spatially aggregated estimates of large-scale fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  over multi-annual time-scales (<a href="098.htm#box31">Box 3.1</a>). Mid- and 
  high latitude forests are covered by extensive national inventories based on 
  repeated measurements of many thousands of plots. Inventories in the tropics 
  are by comparison generally inadequate, particularly in view of the high rates 
  of land-use change and extremely heterogeneous carbon density in many tropical 
  ecosystems. There are still therefore large uncertainties in attempting to balance 
  the terrestrial carbon budget on a global scale using inventory data.</p>
<p>The FAO Temperate and Boreal Forest Resource Assessment (TBFRA-2000) is a recent 
  synthesis of inventories of forests and other wooded lands in <a href="518.htm">Annex 
  I</a> (developed) countries for the early 1990s (UN-ECE/FAO, 2000). Many countries 
  reported substantial increases in forest areas in recent years, as well as increasing 
  carbon density in existing forests. According to TBFRA-2000, the land-atmosphere 
  flux was -0.9 PgC/yr for all <a href="518.htm">Annex I</a> countries combined 
  (the net annual increment of trees accounted for -1.5 PgC/yr, while losses due 
  to fellings were 0.6 PgC/yr). Of this flux, -0.8 PgC/yr was due to uptake in 
  "northern" forests (Europe, CIS, Japan and North America). An earlier 
  review of individual regional and national studies by Dixon et al. (1994), highlighted 
  in the IPCC WGII Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996b; Brown et al., 1996), 
  gave a range of -0.6 to -0.9 PgC/yr for the land atmosphere flux in northern 
  forests. While TBFRA-2000 estimated biomass of woody vegetation only, the analyses 
  reviewed in Dixon et al. (1994) included other vegetation, soils, litter and 
  wood products. Under the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change 
  (UNFCCC) signatory countries are required to report greenhouse gas emissions, 
  including those from land-use change and forestry. Compilation of these data 
  implies a land-atmosphere flux of -0.6 PgC/yr for all Annex I countries, and 
  -0.6 PgC/yr for <a href="518.htm">Annex I</a> countries in the northern latitudes 
  only (UNFCCC, 2000). While the TBFRA synthesised country statistics and adjusted 
  data to fit FAO definitions and methodologies for calculating carbon stocks, 
  the UNFCCC report summarises emissions data reported by each country according 
  to IPCC guidelines; interpretation of guidelines is variable, and not all countries 
  had reported data on land use. The implications of definitions and methodologies 
  in calculating carbon fluxes, particularly in relation to implementation of 
  the Kyoto Protocol, is discussed in detail in the SRLULUCF (IPCC, 2000a).</p>
<p>A recent compilation of data from 478 permanent plots in mature tropical moist 
  forests throughout the tropics over at least two decades found these were taking 
  up carbon due to increasing rates of tree growth. Extrapolation from these plots 
  led to an estimated land-atmosphere flux of (0.6 &plusmn; 0.3 PgC/yr in Latin 
  America; growth trends in African and Asian forests were not significantly different 
  from zero (Phillips et al., 1998). This net uptake is offset by emissions due 
  to deforestation. Dixon et al. (1994) estimated tropical forests overall to 
  be a net source of carbon with a land-atmosphere flux 1.7 &plusmn; 0.4, based 
  mostly on FAO (1993b) inventory data and simple models of the effect of land-use 
  change (Houghton, 1995). It will not be possible to assess trends and fluxes 
  for the 1990s in the tropics from inventory data until a full data set is available 
  from the FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000. Among those countries 
  that have reported land-use emissions data to the UNFCCC, there are significant 
  discrepancies between the primary data used in emissions inventories and the 
  data available in international surveys; for example, rates of deforestation 
  differ from rates reported by FAO (1993b) by as much as a factor of six (Houghton 
  and Ramakrishna, 1999).</p>
<p>The results of globally aggregated forest inventories show a greater uptake 
  of carbon in forest growth than model-based calculations of the marginal effects 
  of land-use change (e.g., Houghton, 2000). Thus, inventory studies provide independent 
  evidence for the existence of a residual terrestrial sink; and they show that 
  a substantial part of this sink, at least, is located in northern extratropical 
  and tropical forests. Additional evidence from individual inventory studies 
  in mature forests that have not undergone land-use changes shows that carbon 
  stocks in such forests are increasing (e.g., Lugo and Brown, 1993; Phillips 
  et al., 1998; Schulze et al., 1999). The difference between the northern extra-tropical 
  land-atmosphere flux of around -0.8 PgC/yr calculated by inventories (TBFRA-2000) 
  and that of -0.1 PgC/yr from land-use statistics (Houghton, 2000), both for 
  the early 1990s, implies a residual terrestrial sink on the order of -0.7 PgC/yr 
  in northern mid- and high latitudes. Combining this with the estimated sink 
  of -0.6 PgC/yr in mature tropical moist forests (Phillips et al., 1998) makes 
  it plausible that at least a significant fraction of the current global terrestrial 
  sink (<a href="097.htm#tab31">Table 3.1</a>) could be explained by an increase 
  of carbon stocks in extant forests. The inventory-based estimate of land-atmosphere 
  flux in northern forests (-0.8 PgC/yr) is at the positive end of the range calculated 
  by inverse modelling studies for the &gt;30&deg;N latitude band from 1990 to 
  1996 (-1.8 to -0.7 PgC/yr, <a href="112.htm">Section 3.5.3</a>), either because 
  of biases in inverse modelling that might tend to increase apparent uptake in 
  the north (<a href="112.htm">Section 3.5.3</a>), or because possible sinks in 
  other ecosystems (e.g., temperate grassland soils) have not been considered 
  in the inventories. In the tropics, the difference between the uptake of carbon 
  estimated by inventory studies in mature forests of Latin America (-0.6 PgC/yr) 
  (Phillips et al., 1998) and the estimated emissions due to deforestation in 
  the tropics of 1.7 PgC/yr (Houghton, 2000) yields an estimated land-atmosphere 
  flux of 1.1 PgC/yr, which is at the positive end of the range calculated by 
  inverse modelling studies for 30&deg;S to 30&deg;N (-1.3 to +1.1 PgC/yr, <a href="112.htm">Section 
  3.5.3</a>). Again, it should be noted that possible additional sinks (e.g., 
  in savannas) are neglected by the land-use and inventory-based calculations.</p>
