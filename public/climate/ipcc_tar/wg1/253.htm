<a name="fig67"></a>While previous sections have concentrated upon estimates of 
the global annual mean of the radiative forcing of particular mechanisms, this 
section presents the geographical distribution of the present day radiative forcings. 
Although the exact spatial distribution of the radiative forcing may differ between 
studies, many of them show similar features that are highlighted in this section. 
With the exception of well-mixed greenhouse gases, different studies calculate 
different magnitudes of the radiative forcing. In these cases, the spatial distributions 
are discussed, not the absolute values of the radiative forcing. It should be 
stressed that the <a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7</a> represents plausible examples 
of geographical distributions only - significant differences may occur in 
other studies. In addition to <a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7</a>, <a href="251.htm#tab611">Table 
6.11</a> lists Northern to Southern Hemisphere ratio for forcings.
<h3><a name="6141"></a>6.14.1 Gaseous Species</h3>
<p>An example of the radiative forcing due to the combined effects of present 
  day concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, CFC-11 and CFC-12 is shown in <a href="#fig67">Figure 
  6.7a</a> (see Shine and Forster, 1999, for further details). The zonal nature 
  of the radiative forcing is apparent and is similar to the radiative forcing 
  due to well-mixed greenhouse gases from Kiehl and Briegleb (1993) presented 
  in IPCC (1994). The radiative forcing ranges from approximately +1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> at the 
  polar regions to +3 Wm<sup>-2</sup> in the sub-tropics. The pattern of the radiative forcing 
  is governed mainly by variations of surface temperature and water vapour and 
  the occurrence of high level cloud (<a href="218.htm">Section 6.3</a>).</p>
<p>An example of the radiative forcing due to stratospheric ozone depletion is 
  shown in <a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7b</a> which was calculated using zonal mean 
  stratospheric ozone depletions from 1979 to 1994 (WMO, 1995) by Shine and Forster 
  (1999). The zonal nature of the radiative forcing is apparent with strongest 
  radiative forcings occurring in polar regions which are areas of maximum ozone 
  depletion (<a href="223.htm">Section 6.4</a>). The gradient of the radiative 
  forcing tends to enhance the zonal gradient of the radiative forcing due to 
  gaseous species shown in <a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7a</a>.</p>
<p>An example of the radiative forcing due to modelled increases in tropospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub> is shown in <a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7c</a> (Berntsen et al., 1997; Shine 
  and Forster, 1999). While the exact spatial distribution of the radiative forcing 
  may differ in other studies, the general pattern showing a maximum radiative 
  forcing over North Africa and the Middle East is common to many other studies 
  (<a href="225.htm">Section 6.5</a>). However, observational evidence presented 
  by Kiehl et al. (1999) suggests that this might be an artefact introduced by 
  the chemical transport models. The radiative forcing is much less homogeneous 
  than for well-mixed greenhouse gases, the maximum radiative forcing being due 
  to the coincidence of a relatively large O<sub>3</sub> change, warm surface temperatures, 
  high surface reflectance, and cloud-free conditions.</p>
<h3><a name="6142"></a>6.14.2 Aerosol Species </h3>
<p>An example of the direct radiative forcing due to sulphate aerosol is shown 
  in <a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7d</a> (Haywood et al., 1997a). In common with 
  many other studies (see <a href="231.htm#67">Section 6.7</a>), the direct radiative 
  forcing is negative everywhere, and there are three main areas where the radiative 
  forcing is strongest in the Northern Hemisphere corresponding to the main industrialised 
  regions of North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia. In the Southern Hemisphere, 
  two less strong regions are seen. The ratio of the radiative forcing in the 
  Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere has been reported by many studies 
  and varies from 2 (Graf et al., 1997) to approximately 7 (Myhre et al., 1998c). 
  Generally, the strongest sulphate direct radiative forcing occurs over land 
  areas although the low surface reflectance means that areas of water close to 
  heavily industrialised regions such as the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea 
  and the Baltic Sea result in strong local radiative forcings. Due to the large 
  areal extent of ocean regions, the contribution to the total annual mean radiative 
  forcing from ocean regions is significant. The ratio of the annual mean radiative 
  forcing over land to that over oceans varies from approximately 1.3 (Kiehl et 
  al., 2000) to 3.4 (Boucher and Anderson, 1995) (see <a href="232.htm#tab64">Table 
  6.4</a>).</p>
<p>An example of the direct radiative forcing due to organic carbon and black 
  carbon from biomass burning is shown in <a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7e</a> (Penner 
  et al., 1998b; Grant et al., 1999). While the radiative forcing is generally 
  negative, positive forcing occurs in areas with a very high surface reflectance 
  such as desert regions in North Africa, and the snow fields of the Himalayas. 
  This is because biomass burning aerosols contain black carbon and are partially 
  absorbing. The dependency of the sign of the radiative forcing from partially 
  absorbing aerosols upon the surface reflectance has been investigated by a number 
  of recent studies (e.g., Chylek and Wong, 1995; Chylek et al., 1995; Haywood 
  and Shine, 1995; Hansen et al., 1997a). The strongest negative radiative forcing 
  is associated with regions of intense biomass burning activity namely, South 
  America, Africa, and Southern Asia and Indonesia and differ from the regions 
  where the sulphate radiative forcing is strongest (<a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7d</a>), 
  being confined to approximately 30<sup>o</sup>N to 30<sup>o</sup>S.</p>
<p>An example of the direct radiative forcing due to organic and black carbon 
  from fossil fuel burning is shown in <a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7f</a> (Penner 
  et al., 1998b; Grant et al., 1999). In contrast to the direct radiative forcing 
  from biomass burning (<a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7e</a>), the modelled direct 
  radiative forcing is generally positive except over some oceanic regions near 
  industrialised regions such as the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. This is 
  because, on average, aerosols emitted from fossil fuels contain a higher black/organic 
  carbon ratio than biomass aerosols (Penner et al., 1998b; Grant et al., 1999) 
  and are thus more absorbing. Comparison of the radiative forcing due to sulphate 
  aerosols reveals that the areas of strongest sulphate direct radiative forcing 
  are offset to some degree by the radiative forcing due to fossil fuel emissions 
  of black carbon as shown in calculations by Haywood et al. (1997a) and Myhre 
  et al. (1998c). Additional regions of moderate positive radiative forcing are 
  present over areas of high surface reflectance such as northern polar regions 
  and the North African deserts.</p>
<p>An example of the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic emissions of 
  mineral dust is shown in <a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7g</a> (Tegen et al., 1996). 
  Areas of strong positive forcing are shown over regions with high surface reflectance 
  such as desert regions in Africa and over the snow surfaces of the Himalayas 
  and areas of strong negative forcing are apparent over ocean areas close to 
  mineral dust sources such as off the coasts of Arabia and North Africa. The 
  exact switchover between areas of positive and negative radiative forcing are 
  not well established owing to uncertainties in the modelled mineral aerosol 
  optical properties and depends upon the assumed single scattering albedo (Miller 
  and Tegen, 1998), the long-wave properties and altitude of the aerosol (<a href="236.htm">Section 
  6.7.6</a>).</p>
<p>An example of the "first" indirect radiative effect (i.e., changes 
  in the cloud reflectivity only) due to anthropogenic industrial aerosols is 
  shown in <a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7h</a>. The forcing is calculated diagnostically 
  in a similar way to Jones and Slingo (1997), but is based on a more recent version 
  of the Hadley Centre model (HadAM3; Pope et al., 2000), uses updated sulphur 
  emission scenarios from the SRES scenario for the year 2000 (Johns et al., 2001) 
  and also includes a simple parametrization of sea salt aerosol (Jones et al., 
  1999). The spatial distribution of the indirect radiative forcing is quite different 
  from the direct radiative forcing with strong areas of forcing off the coasts 
  of industrialised regions (note the change in scale of <a href="#fig67">Figure 
  6.7h</a>). There is a significant radiative forcing over land regions such as 
  Europe and the Eastern coast of North America, and Southeast Asia. The spatial 
  distribution of the indirect radiative forcing will depend critically upon the 
  assumed spatial distribution of the background aerosol field and the applied 
  anthropogenic perturbation and differs substantially between studies (see <a href="242.htm">Section 
  6.8.5</a>). It would have a very different spatial distribution if the effect 
  of biomass burning aerosols were included. The "second" indirect effect 
  whereby inclusion of aerosols influences the lifetime of clouds is not considered 
  here due to the complications of necessarily including some cloud feedback processes 
  in the estimates (<a href="242.htm">Section 6.8.5</a>), but may well resemble 
  the spatial distribution of the "first" indirect effect.</p>
<h3><a name="6143"></a>6.14.3 Other Radiative Forcing Mechanisms</h3>
<p>The spatial distribution of three other radiative forcing mechanisms are considered 
  in this section: the radiative forcing due to contrails, land-use change, and 
  solar variability. The radiative forcing due to other constituents such as nitrate 
  aerosol and aviation-induced cirrus that are very difficult to quantify at present 
  are not presented as geographic distributions of the radiative forcing are currently 
  considered to be speculative.</p>
<p>An example of the present day radiative forcing due to the effect of contrails 
  is shown in <a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7i</a> (Minnis et al., 1999). The radiative 
  forcing is very inhomogeneous, being confined to air-traffic corridors (IPCC, 
  1999). Future scenarios for aircraft emissions may shift the current geographical 
  pattern of the radiative forcing as discussed in IPCC (1999).</p>
<p>An example of an estimate of the radiative forcing due to changes in land use 
  is shown in <a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7j</a> (Hansen et al., 1998). The areas 
  of strongest negative forcing occur at northern latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere 
  due to the felling of forests which have a lower albedo when snow is present 
  (see <a href="251.htm">Section 6.13</a>). Additional effects are due to the 
  change in albedo between crop lands and naturally occurring vegetation. Examples 
  where the radiative forcing is positive include areas where irrigation has enabled 
  crop-growing on previously barren land.</p>
<p>An example of the present day radiative forcing due to solar variability is 
  shown in <a href="#fig67">Figure 6.7k</a>. The solar radiative forcing was calculated 
  by scaling the top of the atmosphere net solar radiation such that the global 
  average is +0.3 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (as deduced for global average radiative forcing 
  since 1750, see <a href="251.htm#6131">Section 6.13.1</a>). Thus it assumes 
  a 0.125% increase in solar constant and no change in any other parameter (e.g., 
  O<sub>3</sub>, cloud). The cloud and radiation fields were calculated within 
  a run of the UGAMP GCM (Haigh, 1996). The strongest radiative forcings exist 
  where the surface reflectance is low (i.e., oceanic regions) and the insolation 
  is highest (i.e., equatorial regions). The solar radiative forcing is also modulated 
  by cloud amount, areas with low cloud amount showing the strongest radiative 
  forcing. The solar radiative forcing is more inhomogeneous than the radiative 
  forcing due to gaseous species (<a href="#6141">Section 6.14.1</a>), but more 
  homogeneous than the radiative forcing due to aerosol species (<a href="#6142">Section 
  6.14.2</a>).</p>
<p>While the preceding sections have shown that the radiative forcing due to the 
  different forcing mechanisms have very different spatial distributions, it is 
  essential to note that the forcing/response relationship given in <a href="216.htm">Section 
  6.2</a> relates global mean radiative forcings to global mean temperature response. 
  Thus, it is not possible to simply map the geographical radiative forcing mechanisms 
  by assuming a globally invariant climate sensitivity parameter to predict a 
  geographic temperature response, due to the complex nature of the atmosphere-ocean 
  system. Rather, the effects of spatial inhomogeneity in the distribution of 
  the radiative forcing may lead to locally different responses in surface temperature 
  (<a href="216.htm">Section 6.2</a>) indicating that the spatial distributions 
  of the radiative forcing need to be accurately represented to improve regional 
  estimates of surface temperature response and other physical parameters. </p>
