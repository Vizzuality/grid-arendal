<h3>6.3.1 Carbon Dioxide</h3>
<p>IPCC (1990) and the SAR used a radiative forcing of 4.37 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for 
  a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> calculated with a simplified expression. Since 
  then several studies, including some using GCMs (Mitchell and Johns, 1997; Ramaswamy 
  and Chen, 1997b; Hansen et al., 1998), have calculated a lower radiative forcing 
  due to CO<sub>2</sub> (Pinnock et al., 1995; Roehl et al., 1995; Myhre and Stordal, 
  1997; Myhre et al., 1998b; Jain et al., 2000). The newer estimates of radiative 
  forcing due to a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> are between 3.5 and 4.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  with the relevant species and various overlaps between greenhouse gases included. 
  The lower forcing in the cited newer studies is due to an accounting of the 
  stratospheric temperature adjustment which was not properly taken into account 
  in the simplified expression used in IPCC (1990) and the SAR (Myhre et al., 
  1998b). In Myhre et al. (1998b) and Jain et al. (2000), the short-wave forcing 
  due to CO<sub>2</sub> is also included, an effect not taken into account in 
  the SAR. The short-wave effect results in a negative forcing contribution for 
  the surface-troposphere system owing to the extra absorption due to CO<sub>2</sub> 
  in the stratosphere; however, this effect is relatively small compared to the 
  total radiative forcing (&lt; 5%).</p>
<p>The new best estimate based on the published results for the radiative forcing 
  due to a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> is 3.7 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, which is a reduction 
  of 15% compared to the SAR. The forcing since pre-industrial times in the SAR 
  was estimated to be 1.56 Wm<sup>-2</sup>; this is now altered to 1.46 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  in accordance with the discussion above. The overall decrease of about 6% (from 
  1.56 to 1.46) accounts for the above effect and also accounts for the increase 
  in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration since the time period considered in the SAR 
  (the latter effect, by itself, yields an increase in the forcing of about 10%).</p>
<p>While an updating of the simplified expressions to account for the stratospheric 
  adjustment becomes necessary for radiative forcing estimates, it is noted that 
  GCM simulations of CO<sub>2</sub>-induced climate effects already account for 
  this physical effect implicitly (see also <sub>Chapter 9</sub>). In some climate 
  studies, the sum of the non-CO<sub>2</sub> well-mixed greenhouse gases forcing 
  is represented by that due to an equivalent amount of CO<sub>2</sub>. Because 
  the CO<sub>2</sub> forcing in the SAR was higher than the new estimate, the 
  use of the equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> concept would underestimate the impact 
  of the non-CO<sub>2</sub> well-mixed gases, if the IPCC values of radiative 
  forcing were used in the scaling operation.</p>
