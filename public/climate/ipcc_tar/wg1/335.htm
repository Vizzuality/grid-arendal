<h2>8.9 Coupled Models - Dependence on Resolution </h2>
<p>The importance of numerical aspects of climate models continues to be well 
  recognised and new numerical techniques are beginning to be tested for use in 
  climate simulation. However, there has been very little systematic investigation 
  of the impact of improved numerics for climate simulation and many important 
  questions remain unanswered. The degree of interaction between horizontal and 
  vertical resolution in climate models and the interaction of physical parametrizations 
  at differing resolutions has made it extremely difficult to make general statements 
  about the convergence of model solutions and hence the optimum resolution that 
  should be used. An important question regarding the adequacy of resolution is 
  deciding whether the information produced at finer scales at higher resolution 
  feeds back on the larger scales or do the finer scales simply add to local effects 
  (Williamson, 1999). Insufficient systematic work has been done with coupled 
  models to answer this question. As well as improving numerical accuracy in advection, 
  improved horizontal resolution can also improve the representation of the lower 
  boundary of a model (the mountains) and the land-sea mask; this may improve 
  the regional climate of a model but little systematic work has been carried 
  out to assess this aspect.</p>
<h3><a name="891"></a>8.9.1 Resolution in Atmospheric Models</h3>
<p>A series of experiments that explores convergence characteristics has been 
  conducted with the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM) by Williamson (1999). 
  In these experiments the grid and scale of the physical parametrizations was 
  held fixed while the horizontal resolution of the dynamical core was increased. 
  As the dynamical resolution was increased, but the parametrization resolution 
  held fixed, the local Hadley circulation in the dual-resolution model simulations 
  converged to a state close to that produced by a standard model at the fixed 
  parametrization resolution. The mid-latitude transient aspects did not converge 
  with increasing resolution when the scale of the physics was held fixed. Williamson 
  (1999) concludes that the physical parametrizations used in climate models should 
  explicitly take into account the scale of the grid on which it is applied. That 
  does not seem to be common in parametrizations for global climate models today.</p>
<p>Pope et al. (1999) have also illustrated the positive impact of increased horizontal 
  resolution on the climate of HADAM3. A number of systematic errors evident at 
  low resolution are reduced as horizontal resolution is increased from 300 to 
  100 km. Improvements are considered to be mainly associated with better representation 
  of storms. It is apparent that, for some models at least, neither the regional 
  aspects of a climate simulation nor the processes that produce them converge 
  over the range of horizontal resolutions commonly used (e.g., D&eacute;qu&eacute; 
  and Piedelievre, 1995; Stephenson and Royer, 1995; Williamson et al., 1995; 
  Stephenson et al., 1998). As part of a European project (High Resolution Ten-Year 
  Climate Simulations, HIRETYCS, 1998), it was found that increases in horizontal 
  resolution did not produce systematic improvements in model simulations and 
  any improvements found were of modest amplitude.</p>
<p>The need for consistency between horizontal and vertical resolution in atmospheric 
  models was first outlined by Lindzen and Fox-Rabinovitz (1989) but little systematic 
  study has been followed. Experiments with the NCAR CCM3 showed that increased 
  vertical resolution (up to 26 levels) above the standard 18 levels typical of 
  the modest vertical resolutions of climate models is beneficial to the simulations 
  (Williamson et al., 1998). Pope et al. (2000) also considered the impact of 
  increased (up to 30 levels) vertical resolution on simulations with HADAM3. 
  In both cases a number of improvements were noted due mostly to the improved 
  representation of the tropopause as the resolution was increased. However, Bossuet 
  et al. (1998) reached a somewhat different conclusion when they increased the 
  vertical resolution in the ARPEGE model; they concluded that increasing vertical 
  resolution produced little impact on the simulated mean climate of their model. 
  They also found that the physical parametrizations they employed were resolution 
  independent. Increased vertical resolution in the upper troposphere and stratosphere 
  has generally reduced model systematic errors in that region (Pawson et al., 
  2000).</p>
<p>Enhanced regional resolution within an AGCM is possible through the global 
  variable-resolution stretched-grid approach that has been further developed 
  since the SAR (e.g., D&egrave;qu&egrave; and Piedelievre, 1995; Fox-Rabinovitz 
  et al., 1997); this is discussed in more detail in <a href="373.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="892"></a>8.9.2 Resolution in Ocean Models</h3>
<p>A number of important oceanic processes are not resolved by the current generation 
  of coupled models, e.g., boundary currents, mesoscale eddy fluxes, sill through 
  flows. Two model studies show an explicit dependence of ocean heat transport 
  on resolution, ranging between 4&deg; and 0.1&deg; (Fanning and Weaver, 1997a; 
  Bryan and Smith, 1998). However, this dependence appears to be much weaker when 
  more advanced sub-grid scale mixing parametrizations are used, at least at resolutions 
  of 0.4&deg; or less (Gent et al., 1999). As previously noted, a number of recent 
  non-flux adjusted models produce acceptable large-scale heat transports. The 
  need for ocean resolution finer than 1&deg; is a matter of continuing scientific 
  debate.</p>
<p>Some ocean models have been configured with increased horizontal resolution 
  (usually specifically in the meridional direction) in the tropics in order to 
  provide a better numerical framework to handle tropical ocean dynamics. Unfortunately 
  at this time, there has been little systematic intercomparison of such model 
  configurations.</p>
<h3><a name="893"></a>8.9.3 Summary</h3>
<p>The lack of carefully designed systematic intercomparison experiments exploring 
  impacts of resolution is restricting our ability to draw firm conclusions. However, 
  while the horizontal resolution of 2.5&deg; (T42) or better in the atmospheric 
  component of many coupled models is probably adequate to resolve most important 
  features, the typical vertical resolution of around 20 levels is probably too 
  low, particularly in the atmospheric boundary layer and near the tropopause. 
  The potential exists for spurious numerical dispersion, when combined with errors 
  in parametrizations and incompletely modelled processes, to produce erroneous 
  entropy sources. This suggests that further careful investigation of model numerics 
  is required as part of a continuing overall programme of model improvement. 
  The vertical resolution required in the ocean component is still a matter of 
  judgement and tends to be governed by available computing resources. There is 
  still considerable debate on the adequacy of the horizontal resolution in the 
  ocean component of coupled models and it is suggested that some results (those 
  that are reliant on meridional heat transport) from coupled models with coarse 
  (&gt;1&deg;) resolution ocean components should be treated cautiously.</p>
