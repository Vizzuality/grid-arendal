<h2>3.6 Carbon Cycle Model Evaluation </h2>
<h3><a name="361"></a>3.6.1 Terrestrial and Ocean Biogeochemistry Models</h3>
<p>The interactions of complex processes as discussed in <a href="098.htm">Section 
  3.2</a> can be analysed with models that incorporate current knowledge at the 
  process level, including syntheses of experimental results. Process-based models 
  make it possible to explore the potential consequences of climate variability 
  for the global carbon cycle, and to project possible future changes in carbon 
  cycling associated with changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation. Models 
  can be run with prescribed inputs such as observations of surface climate and 
  CO<sub>2</sub> or the output of climate models. They can also be coupled to 
  atmospheric general circulation models (Cox et al., 2000; Friedlingstein et 
  al., 2000), to allow simulation of a wider range of interactions between climate 
  and the carbon cycle. </p>
<p>Process-based terrestrial models used in carbon cycle studies are (a) terrestrial 
  biogeochemical models (TBMs), which simulate fluxes of carbon, water and nitrogen 
  coupled within terrestrial ecosystems, and (b) dynamic global vegetation models 
  (DGVMs), which further couple these processes interactively with changes in 
  ecosystem structure and composition (competition among different plant functional 
  types; Prentice et al., 2000). The treatment of carbon-nutrient interaction 
  varies widely; for example, some models treat nitrogen supply explicitly as 
  a constraint on NPP, while others do not. There are currently about 30 TBMs 
  and &lt;10 DGVMs. Cramer and Field (1999) and Cramer et al. (2001) reported 
  results from intercomparisons of TBMs and DGVMs respectively. A current international 
  project, Ecosystem Model/Data Intercomparison (EMDI), aims to test models of 
  both types against a large set of terrestrial measurements, in order to better 
  constrain the modelled responses of terrestrial carbon cycling to changes in 
  CO<sub>2</sub> and climate. </p>
<p>Process-based ocean models used in carbon cycle studies include surface exchange 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> with the atmosphere, carbon chemistry, transport by physical 
  processes in the ocean, and transport by marine biology. The parametrization 
  of marine biology can be classified as (a) nutrient-based models where the export 
  of carbon below the surface ocean (approximately the top 50 m) is a function 
  of surface nutrient concentration, (b) nutrient-restoring models in which biological 
  carbon fluxes are set to the rates required for maintaining observed nutrient 
  concentration gradients against dissipation by ocean mixing, and (c) models 
  that explicitly represent the food chain involving nutrients, phytoplankton, 
  zooplankton and detritus (NPZD models). In current models, the uptake of anthropogenic 
  CO<sub>2</sub> is controlled mainly by physical transport and surface carbon 
  chemistry, whereas the natural carbon cycle is controlled by physical, chemical 
  and biological processes. The Ocean Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project 
  (OCMIP) compared the performance of four ocean models with respect to natural 
  and anthropogenic tracers (Sarmiento et al., 2000; Orr et al., 2001), and is 
  currently undergoing a similar comparison with 13 models and an extended data 
  set (Orr and Dutay, 1999).</p>
