<h2>6.13 Global Mean Radiative Forcings </h2>
<h3><a name="6131"></a>6.13.1 Estimates</h3>
<p>The global, annual mean radiative forcing estimates from 1750 to the present 
  (late 1990s; about 2000) for the different agents are plotted in <a href="245.htm#fig66">Figure 
  6.6</a>, based on the discussions in the foregoing sections. As in the SAR, 
  the height of the rectangular bar denotes a central or best estimate of the 
  forcing, while the vertical line about the bar is an estimate of the uncertainty 
  range, guided by the spread in the published results and physical understanding, 
  and with no statistical connotation. The uncertainty range, as employed in this 
  chapter, is not the product of systematic quantitative analyses of the various 
  factors associated with the forcing, and thus lacks a rigorous statistical basis. 
  The usage here is different from the manner "uncertainty range" is 
  defined and addressed elsewhere in this document. The SAR had also stated a 
  "confidence level" which represented a subjective judgement that the 
  actual forcing would lie within the specified uncertainty range. In order to 
  avoid the confusion over the use of the term "confidence level", we 
  introduce in this assessment a "level of scientific understanding" 
  (LOSU) that represents, again, a subjective judgement and expresses somewhat 
  similar notions as in the SAR (refer also to IPCC, 1999). The LOSU index for 
  each forcing agent is based on an assessment of the nature of assumptions involved, 
  the uncertainties prevailing about the processes that govern the forcing, and 
  the resulting confidence in the numerical value of the estimate. The subjectivity 
  reflected in the LOSU index is unavoidable and is necessitated by the lack of 
  sufficient quantitative information on the uncertainties, especially for the 
  non-well-mixed greenhouse gas forcing mechanisms. In the case of some forcings, 
  this is in part due to a lack of enough investigations. Thus, the application 
  of rigorous statistical methods to quantify the uncertainties of all of the 
  forcing agents in a uniform manner is not possible at present.</p>
<p>The discussions below relate to the changes with respect to the SAR estimates. 
  In many respects, there is a similarity between the estimates, range and understanding 
  levels listed here, and those stated in the recent studies of Hansen et al. 
  (1998) and Shine and Forster (1999). <a href="#tab611">Table 6.11</a> compares 
  the numerical values with the estimates in the SAR. Also, the Northern to Southern 
  Hemisphere ratio is shown for the present estimates (see also <a href="253.htm">Section 
  6.14</a>). <a href="252.htm#tab612">Table 6.12</a> summarises the principal 
  aspects known regarding the forcings, along with a brief listing of the key 
  uncertainties in the processes which, in turn, lead to uncertainties in and 
  affect the reliability of the quantitative estimates.</p>
<p>The total forcing estimate for well-mixed greenhouse gases is slightly less 
  now, by about 1% (see <a href="218.htm">Section 6.3</a>) compared to the estimate 
  given in the SAR. The uncertainty range remains quite small and these estimates 
  retain a "high" LOSU. This forcing continues to enjoy the highest 
  confidence amongst the different natural and anthropogenic forcings.</p>
<p>The estimate for stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> has increased in magnitude, owing mainly 
  to the inclusion of observed ozone depletions through mid-1995 and beyond. It 
  is an encouraging feature that several different model calculations yield similar 
  estimates for the forcing. The uncertainty range remains similar to that given 
  in the SAR. These arguments suggest an elevation of the confidence in the forcing 
  estimate relative to the SAR. Accordingly, a "medium" LOSU is assigned 
  here. A still higher elevation of the rank is precluded because the O<sub>3</sub> loss 
  profile near tropopause continues to be an uncertainty that is significant and 
  that has not been adequately resolved. Also, the global strato-spheric temperature 
  change calculations involved in the forcing determination are not quantitatively 
  identical to the observed changes, which in turn, affects, the precision of 
  the forcing estimate.</p>
<p>The estimate for tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> (0.35 &plusmn; 0.15 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) is on firmer grounds 
  now than in the SAR. Since that assessment, many different models have been 
  employed to compute the forcing, including one analysis constrained by observations. 
  These have resulted in a narrowing of the uncertainty range and increased the 
  confidence with regards to the central estimate. The preceding argument strongly 
  suggests an advancement of the confidence in this forcing estimate. Hence, a 
  "medium" LOSU is accorded for tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> forcing. Key uncertainties 
  remain concerning the pre-industrial distributions, the effects of stratospheric-tropospheric 
  exchange and the manner of its evolution over time, as well as the seasonal 
  cycle in some regions of the globe.</p>
<p>As the LOSU rankings are subjective and reflect qualitative considerations, 
  the fact that tropospheric and stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> have the same ranks does not 
  imply that the degree of confidence in their respective estimates is identical. 
  In fact, from the observational standpoint, stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> forcing, which 
  has occurred only since 1970s and is better documented, is on relatively firmer 
  ground. Nevertheless, both O<sub>3</sub> components are less certain relative to the well-mixed 
  greenhouse gases, but more so compared with the agents discussed below.</p>
<p>The estimate for the direct sulphate aerosol forcing has also seen multiple 
  model investigations since the SAR, resulting in more estimates being available 
  for this assessment. It is striking that consideration of all of the estimates 
  available since 1996 lead to the same best estimate (-0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) and uncertainty 
  (-0.2 to -0.8 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) range as in the previous assessment. As in the 
  case of O<sub>3</sub>, that could be a motivation for elevating the status of knowledge 
  of this forcing to a higher confidence level. However, there remain critical 
  areas of uncertainty concerning the modelling of the geographical distribution 
  of sulphate aerosols, spatial cloud distributions, effects due to relative humidity 
  etc. Hence, we retain a "low" LOSU for this forcing.</p>
<p>The SAR stated a radiative forcing of +0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for fossil fuel (FF) black 
  carbon aerosols with a range +0.03 to +0.3 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, and a "very low" 
  level of confidence. For biomass burning (BB) aerosols, the SAR stated a radiative 
  forcing of -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with a range -0.07 to -0.6 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, and a "very low" 
  level of confidence. In the present assessment, the radiative forcing of the 
  black carbon component from FF is estimated to be +0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with a range from 
  +0.1 to +0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup> based on studies since the SAR. A "very low" LOSU 
  is accorded in view of the differences in the estimates from the various models. 
  The organic carbon component from FF is estimated to yield a forcing of -0.1 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup> with a range from -0.03 to -0.30 Wm<sup>-2</sup>; this has a "very 
  low" LOSU. Note that extreme caution must be exercised in adding the uncertainties 
  of the organic and black carbon components to get the uncertainty for FF as 
  a whole. For BB aerosols, no attempt is made to separate into black and organic 
  carbon components, in view of considerable uncertainties. The central estimate 
  and range for BB aerosols remains the same as in the SAR; this has a "very 
  low" LOSU in view of the several uncertainties in the calculations (<a href="231.htm#67">Section 
  6.7</a>).</p>
<p>Mineral dust is a new component in the current assessment. The studies on the 
  "disturbed" soils suggest an anthropogenic influence, with a range 
  from +0.4 to -0.6 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. In general, the evaluation for dust aerosol is complicated 
  by the fact that the short-wave consists of a significant reflection and absorption 
  component, and the long-wave also exerts a substantial contribution by way of 
  a trapping of the infrared radiation. Thus, the net radiative energy gained 
  or lost by the system is the difference between non-negligible positive and 
  negative radiative flux changes operating simultaneously. Because of this complexity, 
  we refrain from giving a best estimate and accord this component a "very 
  low" LOSU.</p>
<p>As explained in <a href="238.htm">Section 6.8</a>, the "indirect" 
  forcing due to all tropospheric aerosols can be thought of as comprising two 
  effects. Only the first type of effect as applicable in the context of liquid 
  clouds is considered here. As in the SAR, no best estimate is given in view 
  of the large uncertainties prevailing in this problem (<a href="238.htm">Section 
  6.8</a>). The range (0 to -2 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) is based on published estimates and subjective 
  assessment of the uncertainties. Although several model studies suggest a non-zero, 
  negative value as the upper bound (about -0.3 Wm<sup>-2</sup>), substantial gaps in the 
  knowledge remain which affect the confidence in the model simulations of this 
  forcing (e.g., uncertainties in aerosol and cloud processes and their representations 
  in GCMs, the potentially incomplete knowledge of the radiative effect of black 
  carbon in clouds, and the possibility that the forcings for individual aerosol 
  types may not be additive), such that the possibility of a very small negative 
  value cannot be excluded; thus zero is retained as an upper bound as in the 
  SAR. In view of the large uncertainties in the processes and the quantification, 
  a "very low" LOSU is assigned to this forcing. Inclusion of the second 
  indirect effect (<a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a>) is fraught with even more 
  uncertainties and, despite being conceptually valid as an anthropogenic perturbation, 
  raises the question of whether the model estimates to-date can be unambiguously 
  characterised as an aerosol radiative forcing.</p>
<p>Aviation introduces two distinct types of perturbation (<a href="238.htm">Section 
  6.8</a>). Contrails produced by aircraft constitute an anthropogenic perturbation. 
  This is estimated to contribute 0.02 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with an uncertainty of a factor of 
  3 or 4 (IPCC, 1999); the uncertainty factor is assumed to be 3.5 in <a href="245.htm#fig66">Figure 
  6.6</a>. This has an extremely low level of confidence associated with it. Additionally, 
  aviation-produced cirrus is estimated by IPCC (1999) to yield a forcing of 0 
  to 0.04 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, but no central estimate or uncertainty range was estimated in 
  that report. Both components have a "very low" LOSU.</p>
<p>Volcanic aerosols that represent a transient forcing of the climate system 
  following an eruption are not plotted since they are episodic events and cannot 
  be categorised as a century-scale secular forcing, unlike the others. However, 
  they can have substantial impacts on interannual to decadal scale temperature 
  changes and hence are important factors in the time evolution of the forcing 
  (see <a href="254.htm">Section 6.15</a>). Some studies (Hansen et al., 1998; 
  Shine and Forster, 1999) have attempted to scale the volcanic forcings in a 
  particular decade with respect to that in a quiescent decade.</p>
<p>Land-use change was dealt with in IPCC (1990) but was not considered in the 
  SAR. However, recent studies (e.g., Hansen et al., 1998) have raised the possibility 
  of a negative forcing due to deforestation and the ensuing effects of snow-covered 
  land albedo changes in mid-latitudes. There are not many studies on this subject 
  and rigorous investigations are lacking such that this forcing has a "very 
  low" LOSU, with the range in the estimate being 0 to -0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (central 
  estimate: -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup>). Note that the land-use forcing here is restricted to that 
  due to albedo change.</p>
<p>Solar forcing remains the same as in the SAR, in terms of best estimate, the 
  uncertainty range and the confidence level. Thus, the range is 0.1 to 0.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  with a best estimate of 0.3 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, and with a "very low" LOSU.</p>
