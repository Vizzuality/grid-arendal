<h3>3.3.3 Variations in Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during the Past 11,000 Years 
</h3>
<p>Natural variations in CO<sub>2</sub> during the past 11,000 years (<a href="105.htm#fig32">Figure 
  3.2c</a>) have been small (about 20 ppm) according to the best available measurements, 
  which are from the Taylor Dome ice core (Smith et al., 1999; Inderm&uuml;hle 
  et al., 1999). These measurements show a short-lived maximum around 11 kyr BP, 
  followed by a slight fall, which may have been caused by increasing carbon storage 
  in the terrestrial biosphere. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was about 
  260 ppm at its Holocene minimum around 8 kyr BP and increased towards about 
  280 ppm in the pre-industrial period. The same pattern and the same CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration levels over the past 8 kyr have also been shown in another ice 
  core, BH7 near Vostok (Peybern&egrave;s et al., 2000). The causes of these changes 
  are not known. Preliminary <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-s.gif" width="8" height="10"><sup>13</sup>C 
  measurements (see <a href="#box36">Box 3.6</a>) suggest that this increase may 
  have been due to a gradual reduction in terrestrial carbon storage (Inderm&uuml;hle 
  et al., 1999; Smith et al., 1999) but others have considered an oceanic explanation 
  more likely.</p>
<p>Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have also been reconstructed indirectly, 
  from stomatal index measurements on sub-fossil leaves (Van de Water et al., 
  1994; Beerling et al., 1995; Rundgren and Beerling, 1999; Wagner et al., 1999). 
  Stomatal density and stomatal index of many species respond to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  (Woodward, 1987; Woodward and Bazzaz, 1988) but are influenced by other environmental 
  variables as well (Poole et al., 1996). One recent stomatal index record, interpreted 
  as implying high (up to 350 ppm) and rapidly fluctuating CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
  in the early Holocene (Wagner et al., 1999), is clearly incompatible with the 
  ice core record of Inderm&uuml;hle et al. (1999), whereas a continuous stomatal 
  index record from 9 kyr BP onwards (Rundgren and Beerling, 1999) has shown concentration 
  trends consistent with the ice-core records. </p>
<p>Figure 3.2b shows the excellent agreement among different high-resolution Antarctic 
  ice cores covering the past 1,000 years. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  fell by about 8 to 10 ppm during the Little Ice Age (from 1280 to 1860, see 
  <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>) (<a href="105.htm#fig32">Figure. 3.2</a>b, 
  c; Barnola et al., 1995; Etheridge et al., 1996; Inderm&uuml;hle et al., 1999; 
  Rundgren and Beerling, 1999). A slight contemporaneous increase in <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/delta-s.gif" width="8" height="10"><sup>13</sup>C 
  of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has led to the suggestion that this effect was 
  caused by enhanced carbon storage on land (Francey et al., 1999b; Trudinger 
  et al., 1999).<a name="fig34"></a></p>

        al., 1996b; Manning, 2001). The graph shows the relationship between changes 
        in CO<sub>2</sub> (horizontal axis) and O<sub>2</sub> (vertical axis). 
        Observations of annual mean concentrations of O<sub>2</sub>, centred on 
        January 1, are shown from the average of the Alert and La Jolla monitoring 
        stations (Keeling et al., 1996b; Manning, 2001; solid circles) and from 
        the average of the Cape Grim and Point Barrow monitoring stations (Battle 
        et al., 2000; solid triangles). The records from the two laboratories, 
        which use different reference standards, have been shifted to optimally 
        match during the mutually overlapping period. The CO<sub>2</sub> observations 
        represent global averages compiled from the stations of the NOAA network 
        (Conway et al., 1994) with the methods of Tans et al. (1989). The arrow 
        labelled "fossil fuel burning" denotes the effect of the combustion 
        of fossil fuels (Marland et al., 2000; British Petroleum, 2000) based 
        on the relatively well known O<sub>2</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub> stoichiometric 
        relation of the different fuel types (Keeling, 1988). Uptake by land and 
        ocean is constrained by the known O<sub>2</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub> stoichiometric 
        ratio of these processes, defining the slopes of the respective arrows. 
        A small correction is made for differential outgassing of O<sub>2</sub> 
        and N<sub>2</sub> with the increased temperature of the ocean as estimated 
        by Levitus et al. (2000). </p>

<h3><a name="334"></a>3.3.4 Implications</h3>
<p>The Vostok record of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and Antarctic climate is consistent 
  with a view of the climate system in which CO<sub>2</sub> concentration changes 
  amplify orbitally-induced climate changes on glacial/inter-glacial time-scales 
  (Shackleton, 2000). Changes during the present inter-glacial (until the start 
  of the anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> rise) have been small by comparison. Although 
  complete explanations for these changes in the past are lacking, high-resolution 
  ice core records establish that the human-induced increase of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  over the past century is at least an order of magnitude faster than has occurred 
  during the preceeding 20,000 years.</p>

        measure of the relative abundance of the two stable carbon isotopes, <sup>13</sup>C 
        and <sup>12</sup>C, in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> gives in principle similar 
        possibilities to O<sub>2</sub> for the partitioning of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
        uptake (Keeling et al., 1979, 1980; Mook et al., 1983; Keeling et al., 
        1989; Francey et al., 1995; Keeling et al., 1995). The principle of using 
        d13C to separate land and ocean components of the carbon budget relies 
        on the fractionation during photosynthesis by C3 plants, which discriminates 
        against <sup>13</sup>C. This fractionation leads to biospheric carbon 
        being depleted in 13C by about 18&#137; relative to the atmosphere. In 
        contrast, exchanges with the ocean involve relatively small fractionation 
        effects. Changes in the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio of atmospheric 
        CO<sub>2</sub> thus indicate the extent to which concurrent CO<sub>2</sub> 
        variations can be ascribed to variations in biospheric uptake. The calculation 
        also requires specification of the turnover times of carbon in the ocean 
        and on land, because fossil fuel burning implies a continuous release 
        of isotopically light carbon to the atmosphere. This leads to a lowering 
        of the atmospheric <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C isotope ratio, which 
        takes years to centuries to work its way through the carbon cycle (Keeling 
        et al., 1980; Tans et al., 1993; Ciais et al., 1995a,b).</p>
      <p>There are some complications. C3 plants discriminate against 13C more 
        strongly than C4 plants (Lloyd and Farquhar, 1994), thus the distributions 
        of C3 and C4 photosynthesis need to be known. The oceanic disequilibrium 
        can in principle be estimated observationally (Tans et al., 1993; Heimannn 
        and Maier-Reimer, 1996; Bacastow et al., 1996; Gruber et al., 1999), while 
        the terrestrial disequilibrium has to be estimated by means of models 
        (e.g., Ciais et al., 1999). Langenfelds et al. (1999) and Battle et al. 
        (2000) have shown that recently estimated values for the disequilibrium 
        terms lead to consistency between the partitioning of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake 
        into land and ocean uptake based on O<sub>2</sub> and on d<sup>13</sup>C 
        measurements.</p>
