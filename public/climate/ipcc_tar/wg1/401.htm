<h2>10.7 Intercomparison of Methods</h2>
<p>Few formal comparative studies of different regionalisation techniques have 
  been carried out. To date, published work has mostly focused on the comparison 
  between RCMs and statistical downscaling techniques. Early applications of RCMs 
  for climate change simulations (Giorgi and Mearns, 1991; Giorgi et al., 1994) 
  compared the models against observations or against the driving GCMs, but not 
  against statistical/empirical techniques.</p>
<p>Kidson and Thompson (1998) compared the RAMS (Regional Atmospheric Modelling 
  System) dynamical model and a statistical regression-based technique. Both approaches 
  were applied to downscale reanalysis data (ECMWF) over New Zealand to a grid 
  resolution of 50 km. The statistical downscaling used a screening regression 
  technique to predict local minimum and maximum temperature and daily precipitation, 
  at both monthly and daily time-scales. The regression technique limits each 
  regression equation to five predictors (selected from Empirical Orthogonal Functions 
  (EOFs) of atmospheric fields). Both monthly and daily results indicated little 
  difference in skill between the two techniques, and Kidson and Thompson (1998) 
  suggested that, subject to the assumption of statistical relationships remaining 
  viable under a future climate, the computational requirements do not favour 
  the use of the dynamical model. They also noted, however, that the dynamical 
  model performed better with the convective components of precipitation.</p>
<p>Bates et al. (1998) compared a south-western Australia simulation using the 
  DARLAM (CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research Limited Area Model) model with 
  a down-scaled DARLAM simulation where the downscaling model had been fitted 
  independently to observational data. The downscaling reproduced observed precipitation 
  probabilities and wet and dry spell frequencies while the DARLAM simulation 
  under-estimated the frequency of dry spells and over estimated the probability 
  of precipitation and the frequency of wet spells. In a climate change follow-on 
  experiment, again using both methods, Charles et al. (1999b) found a small decrease 
  in probability of precipitation under future climate conditions.</p>
<p>Murphy (1999) evaluated the UK Meteorological Office Unified Model (UM) RCM 
  over Europe against a statistical downscaling model based on regression. Monthly 
  mean surface temperature and precipitation anomalies were down-scaled using 
  predictor sets chosen from a range of candidate variables similar to those used 
  by Kidson and Thompson (1998) (EOFs of atmospheric fields). The results showed 
  similar levels of skill for the dynamical and statistical methods, in line with 
  the Kidson and Thompson (1998) study. The statistical method was nominally better 
  for summertime estimates of temperature, while the dynamical model gave better 
  estimates of wintertime precipitation. Again, the conclusion was drawn that 
  the sophistication of the dynamical model shows little advantage over statistical 
  techniques, at least for present day climates.</p>
<p>Murphy (2000) continued the comparative study by deriving climate change projections 
  for 2080 to 2100 from a simulation with the HadCM2 AOGCM. The dynamical and 
  statistical downscaling techniques were the same regional and statistical models 
  as used by Murphy (1999). The statistical and dynamical techniques produced 
  significantly different predictions of climate change, despite exhibiting similar 
  skill when validated against present day observations. The study identifies 
  two main sources of divergence between the dynamical and statistical techniques: 
  firstly, differences between the strength of the observed and simulated predictor/predictand 
  relationships, and secondly, omission from the regression equations of variables 
  which represent climate change feedbacks, but are weak predictors of natural 
  variability. In particular, the exclusion of specific humidity led to differences 
  between the dynamical and statistical simulations of precipitation change. This 
  point would seem to confirm the humidity issue raised in <a href="397.htm#1063">Section 
  10.6.3</a> (Hewitson and Crane 1996, Crane and Hewitson, 1998, Charles et al., 
  1999b; Hewitson 1999).</p>
<p>Mearns et al. (1999) compared RCM simulations and statistical downscaling using 
  a regional model and a semi-empirical technique based on stochastic procedures 
  conditioned on weather types which were classified from circulation fields (700hPa 
  geopotential heights). While Mearns et al. suggest that the semi-empirical approach 
  incorporates more physical meaning into the relationships than a pure statistical 
  approach does, this approach does impose the assumption that the circulation 
  patterns are robust into a future climate in addition to the normal assumption 
  that the cross-scale relationships are stationary in time. For both techniques, 
  the driving fields were from the CSIRO AOGCM (Watterson et al., 1995). The variables 
  of interest were maximum and minimum daily temperature and precipitation over 
  central-northern USA (Nebraska). As with the preceding studies, the validation 
  under present climate conditions indicated similar skill levels for the dynamical 
  and statistical approaches, with some advantage by the statistical technique.</p>
<p>In line with the Murphy (2000) study, larger differences were also noted by 
  Mearns et al. (1999) when climate change projections were produced. Notably 
  for temperature, the statistical technique produced an amplified seasonal cycle 
  compared to both the RCM and CSIRO data, although similar changes in daily temperature 
  variances were found in both the RCM and the statistical technique (with the 
  statistical approach producing mostly decreases). The spatial patterns of change 
  showed greater variability in the RCM compared with the statistical technique. 
  Mearns et al. (1999) suggested that some of the differences found in the results 
  were due to the climate change simulation exceeding the range of data used to 
  develop the statistical model, while the decreases in variance were likely to 
  be a true reflection of changes in the circulation controls. The precipitation 
  results from Mearns et al. (1999) are different from earlier studies with the 
  same RCM (e.g., Giorgi et al., 1998) that produced few statistically significant 
  changes. </p>
<p>Extending the comparison beyond simple methodological performance, Wilby et 
  al. (2000) compared hydrological responses using data from dynamically and statistically 
  down-scaled climate model output for the Animas River basin in Colorado, USA. 
  While not a climate change projection, the use of output from an RCM and a statistical 
  downscaling approach to drive a distributed hydrological model exemplify the 
  objective of the downscaling. The results indicate that both the statistical 
  and dynamical methods had greater skill (in terms of modelling hydrology) than 
  the coarse resolution reanalysis output used to drive the downscaling. The statistical 
  method had the advantage of requiring very few parameters, an attribute making 
  the procedure attractive for many hydrological applications. The dynmical model 
  output, once elevation-corrected, provided better water balance estimates than 
  raw or elevation-corrected reanalysis output. </p>
<p>Overall, the above comparative studies indicate that for present climate both 
  techniques have similar skill. Since statistical models are based on observed 
  relationships between predictands and predictors, this result may represent 
  a further validation of the performance of RCMs. Under future climate conditions 
  more differences are found between the techniques, and the question arises as 
  to which is "more correct". While the dynamical model should clearly 
  provide a better physical basis for change, it is still unclear whether different 
  regional models generate similar downscaled changes. With regard to statistical/empirical 
  techniques, it would seem that careful attention must be given to the choice 
  of predictors, and that methodologies which internally select predictors based 
  on explanatory power under present climates may exclude predictors important 
  for determining change under future climate modes. </p>
