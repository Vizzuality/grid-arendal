<h4>9.3.6.2 Precipitation and convection</h4>
<p>Increased intensity of precipitation events in a future climate with increased 
  greenhouse gases was one of the earliest model results regarding precipitation 
  extremes, and remains a consistent result in a number of regions with improved, 
  more detailed models (Hennessy et al., 1997; Kothavala, 1997; Durman et al., 
  2001; Yonetani and Gordon, 2001). There have been questions regarding the relatively 
  coarse spatial scale resolution in climate models being able to represent essentially 
  mesoscale and smaller precipitation processes. However, the increase in the 
  ability of the atmosphere to hold more moisture, as well as associated increased 
  radiative cooling of the upper troposphere that contributes to destabilisation 
  of the atmosphere in some models, is physically consistent with increases in 
  precipitation and, potentially, with increases in precipitation rate.</p>
<p>As with other changes, it is recognised that changes in precipitation intensity 
  have a geographical dependence. For example, Bhaskharan and Mitchell (1998) 
  note that the range of precipitation intensity over the south Asian monsoon 
  region broadens in a future climate experiment with increased greenhouse gases, 
  with decreases prevalent in the west and increases more widespread in the east 
  (see further discussion in <a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>). Another model 
  experiment (Brinkop, 2001) shows that extreme values of the convective rain 
  rate and the maximum convective height occur more frequently during the 2071 
  to 2080 period than during the 1981 to 1990 period. The frequency of highest-reaching 
  convective events increases, and the same holds for events with low cloud-top 
  heights. In contrast, the frequency of events with moderate-top heights decreases. 
  On days when it rains, the frequency of the daily rates of convective rainfall 
  larger than 40 mm/day in JJA and greater than 50 mm/day for DJF, increases. 
  Generally, one finds a strong increase in the rain rate per convective event 
  over most of the land areas on the summer hemispheres and in the inter-tropical 
  convergence zone (ITCZ). Between 10 and 30&deg;S there are decreases in rain 
  rate per event over the ocean and parts of the continents.</p>
<p>In global simulations for future climate, the percentage increase in extreme 
  (high) rainfall is greater than the percentage increase in mean rainfall (Kharin 
  and Zwiers, 2000). The return period of extreme precipitation events is shortened 
  almost everywhere (Zwiers and Kharin, 1998). For example, they show that over 
  North America the 20-year return periods are reduced by a factor of 2 indicating 
  that extreme precipitation of that order occurs twice as often.</p>
<p>Another long-standing model result related to drought (a reduction in soil 
  moisture and general drying of the mid-continental areas during summer with 
  increasing CO<sub>2</sub>) has been reproduced with the latest generation of global coupled 
  climate models (Gregory et al., 1997; Haywood et al., 1997; Kothavala, 1999; 
  Wetherald and Manabe, 1999). This summer drying is generally ascribed to a combination 
  of increased temperature and potential evaporation not being balanced by precipitation. 
  To address this problem more quantitatively, a global climate model with increased 
  CO<sub>2</sub> was analysed to show large increases in frequency of low summer precipitation, 
  the probability of dry soil, and the occurrence of long dry spells (Gregory 
  et al., 1997). The latter was ascribed to the reduction of rainfall events in 
  the model rather than to decreases in mean precipitation. However, the magnitude 
  of this summer drying response may be related to the model's simulation 
  of net solar radiation at the surface, and more accurate simulation of surface 
  fluxes over land will increase confidence in the GCM climate changes.</p>
<p>Alhough of great importance to society for their potential for causing destruction, 
  as well as their human and economic impacts, there is little guidance from AOGCMs 
  concerning the future behaviour of tornadoes, hail or lightning. This is because 
  these phenomena are not explicitly resolved in AOGCMs, and any studies that 
  have been done have had to rely on empirical relationships between model features 
  and the phenomenon of interest. For example, Price and Rind (1994a) derive a 
  relationship between lightning activity and convective cloud-top height to infer 
  an increase of lightning with increasing CO<sub>2</sub>. They take that relationship one 
  step further to suggest a future increase in lightning-caused fires due to the 
  increased lightning activity and decreased effective precipitation (Price and 
  Rind, 1994b). Using another empirical relationship between daily minimum temperature 
  and severe convective storm frequency for France, Dessens (1995) connects an 
  increase in daily minimum temperature with greater convective storm frequency 
  and more hail damage in a future climate with increased CO<sub>2</sub>. However, there 
  have been no recent studies examining this problem with the current generation 
  of global climate models. Due to the fact that these severe weather phenomena 
  are sub-grid scale (even more so than discussed below for tropical cyclones), 
  and that second and third order linkages between model output and empirical 
  relationships for limited regions must be used to derive results, we cannot 
  reach any definitive conclusions concerning possible future increases in hail 
  and lightning, and there is no information from AOGCMs concerning future changes 
  in tornado activity.</p>
