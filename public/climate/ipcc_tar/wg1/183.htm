<h3>5.3.3 Factors Controlling Cloud Condensation Nuclei<br>
</h3>
<p>The effectiveness of an aerosol particle as a CCN depends on its size and response 
  to water. Atmospheric aerosol particles are either hydrophobic (i.e. will not 
  activate in cloud under any circumstances), water-insoluble but possess hydrophyllic 
  sites that allow the particles to wet and activate at higher supersaturations, 
  or have some water-soluble component and will activate at lower supersaturations 
  given sufficient time to achieve their critical radius. Only particles with 
  some water-soluble species are significant for the indirect forcing (e.g., Kulmala 
  et al., 1996; Eichel et al., 1996). However, there are many water-soluble compounds 
  in the atmospheric aerosol with widely varying degrees of solubility.<br>
</p>
<p> Sulphates, sodium chloride, and other water-soluble salts and inorganic acids 
  are common to the atmospheric aerosol (<a href="167.htm">Section 5.2</a>) and 
  to CCN (e.g., Hudson and Da, 1996). The abilities of these species to serve 
  as CCN are relatively well known, whereas our understanding of the ability of 
  organic species to act as CCN is relatively poor. This is a critical area of 
  uncertainty for the global-scale modelling of cloud droplet nucleation.<br>
</p>
<p> The water-soluble fraction of organic species in aerosols can be high relative 
  to sulphate (e.g., Li et al., 1996; Zappoli et al., 1999), and organics may 
  be important sources of CCN in at least some circumstances (Novakov and Penner, 
  1993; Rivera-Carpio et al., 1996). Aerosols from biomass burning are primarily 
  composed of organics and may act as CCN, but some of their CCN activity may 
  actually be due to co-resident inorganic constituents (Van-Dinh et al. 1994; 
  Novakov and Corrigan, 1996; Leaitch et al., 1996a). Measurements from a forested 
  area suggest that some of the products of terpene oxidation may serve as CCN 
  (Leaitch et al., 1999), and Virkkula et al. (1999) found that particles from 
  pinene oxidation absorbed some water at an RH of about 84%. Cruz and Pandis 
  (1997) examined the CCN activity of particles of adipic acid and of glutaric 
  acid (products of alkene oxidation) and found reasonable agreement with K&ouml;hler 
  theory, whereas Corrigan and Novakov (1999) measured much higher activation 
  diameters than predicted by theory. Volatile organic acids (formic, acetic, 
  pyruvic, oxalic) may also contribute to the formation of CCN in areas covered 
  with vegetation and in plumes from biomass burning (Yu, 2000). P&ouml;sfai et 
  al. (1998) suggest that organic films can be responsible for relatively large 
  water uptake at low RH.<br>
</p>
<p>The wide range of solubilities of the organic species may help to explain why 
  observations do not always provide a consistent picture of the uptake of water. 
  The water solubility of the oxygenated organic species tends to decrease with 
  increasing the carbon number (Saxena and Hildemann, 1996). Shulman et al. (1996) 
  showed that the cloud activation of organic species with lower solubilties might 
  be delayed due to the increased time required for dissolution, and delays of 
  1-3 seconds have been observed (Shantz et al., 1999). For a mixture of an inorganic 
  salt or acid with an organic that is at least slightly soluble, the presence 
  of the organic may contribute to some reduction in the critical supersaturation 
  for activation (Corrigan and Novakov, 1999) especially if the organics reduce 
  the surface tension (Shulman et al. 1996) as demonstrated in natural cloud water 
  (Facchini et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Historically, much of the interest in organics has focused on the inhibition 
  of CCN activation in cloud by surface-active organics. Recently, Hansson et 
  al. (1998) found that thick coatings of either of two insoluble high molecular 
  weight organics (50 to 100% by mass of tetracosane or of lauric acid) reduced 
  the hygroscopic growth factor for particles of NaCl. On the other hand, studies 
  by Shulman et al. (1996), Cruz and Pandis (1998), and Virkkula et al. (1999) 
  suggest that coatings of organic acids do not necessarily inhibit the effect 
  of the other species on the condensation of water. The ability of the hydrophobic 
  coating to form a complete barrier to the water vapour is a critical aspect 
  of this issue. It is unlikely that such coatings are common in the atmosphere.</p>
<p><br>
  Although the CCN activities of inorganic components of the aerosol are well 
  known, there are other aspects to the water activity of these species that need 
  to be considered. Highly soluble gases, such as HNO<sub>3</sub>, can dissolve 
  into a growing solution droplet prior to activation in cloud. The addition of 
  this inorganic substance to the solution can decrease the critical supersaturation 
  for activation (Kulmula et al., 1993; Laaksonen et al., 1998). The result is 
  an increase in cloud droplet number but this is tempered somewhat by an enhanced 
  condensation rate that contributes to a slight reduction in the cloud supersaturation. 
  The importance of this effect will depend on the mixing ratio of such gases 
  relative to the CCN solute concentrations and this has not been properly evaluated. 
  An important consideration for the development of the CCN spectrum is the in-cloud 
  oxidation of SO<sub>2</sub>. Current models indicate that the fraction of secondary 
  sulphate that is due to SO<sub>2</sub> oxidation in cloud can be in the range 
  of 60 to 80% (<a href="172.htm#tab55">Table 5.5</a>). While the uncertainty 
  in this estimate does not greatly impact the model sulphur budgets, it has significant 
  consequences for the magnitude of the predicted indirect forcing (Chuang et 
  al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Large-scale models must be able to represent several factors related to CCN 
  in order to better assess the indirect effect: the size distribution of the 
  mass of water-soluble species, the degree of solubility of the represented species, 
  and the amount of mixing of individual species within a given size fraction. 
  The most critical species are sulphates, organics, sea salt and nitrates.</p>
