<i> <!-- #BeginEditable "Page_Content_Here" --><b>Figure 12.10:</b> Comparison 
between the amplitude of anthropogenic signals from observed and modelled JJA 
trend patterns using fingerprints from two different climate models (ECHAM3/LSG 
and HadCM2) and data from five climate models. (a) Comparison of the amplitude 
of a single greenhouse gas + sulphate aerosol (GS) signal (expressed as change 
in global mean temperature [&deg;C] over 50 years). Results show that a significant 
GS signal can be detected in observed trend patterns 1949 to 1998 at a 5% significance 
level (one-sided test), independent of which pair of fingerprints was used. The 
observed signal amplitude is consistent with contemporaneous GS amplitudes for 
most models' GS simulations. 90% confidence intervals are shown by solid 
lines for estimates using ECHAM3/LSG fingerprints and by dashed lines for estimates 
based on HadCM2 fingerprints. Cases where a model's and the observed amplitude 
disagree are marked by a cross on the axis. (b) and (c) show an estimate of the 
observed amplitude of a greenhouse gas signal (horizontal axis) and a sulphate 
aerosol signal (vertical axis) estimated simultaneously. Both signal amplitudes 
can be estimated as positive from observations based on ECHAM3/LSG fingerprints 
shown in (b) while only the greenhouse gas signal is detected based on HadCM2 
fingerprints shown in panel (c). The amplitudes of both signals from the observations 
are compared with those from model simulations forced with various forcing histories 
and using different climate models (1: HadCM2; 2: ECHAM3/LSG; 3: GFDL; 4: ECHAM4/OPYC; 
5: CCCma1; 6: CCCma2). Simulations with symbols shown in black are consistent 
with observations relative to the uncertainty in observations (grey ellipse) and 
that of the model simulations (not shown). Simulations which are inconsistent 
are shown in grey. Model simulations where only a single ensemble member is available 
are illustrated by thin symbols, those based on ensembles of simulations by fat 
symbols.<br>
Results from consistency tests indicate that most greenhouse gas only simulations 
(G, shown by &quot;x&quot;) are inconsistent with observations. Ten of the 
GS simulations in both panels are in agreement with observed trend patterns, discrepancies 
arise mostly from the magnitude of a sulphate signal (vertical axis). The failure 
to detect a sulphate signal as well as a greenhouse gas signal in panel (c) is 
due to the two signals being very highly correlated if only spatial patterns are 
used- this makes separation of the signals difficult. These results show that 
estimates of a sulphate aerosol signal from observations are model dependent and 
quite uncertain, while a single anthropogenic signal can be estimated with more 
confidence.<br>
All units are in &deg;C/50 year, values in the upper right quadrant refer to a 
physically meaningful greenhouse warming and sulphate aerosol cooling signal. 
The consistency test establishes whether the difference between a model's 
and the observed amplitude estimate is significantly larger than the combined 
uncertainty in the observations (internal variability + observational uncertainty) 
and the model simulation (internal variability). The figure is derived by updating 
the data used by Barnett et al. (1999) (for details of the analysis see Hegerl 
et al., 2000) and then applying a simple linear transformation of the multi-regression 
results (Hegerl and Allen, 2000).<br>
Results for 1946 to 1995 period used by Barnett et al. (1999) are similar, except 
fewer of the models in b and c agree with observations and the case of both signals 
being zero in c is not rejected. Simulations of natural forcing only ending before 
1998 are also rejected in that case. <!-- #EndEditable --> </i>
