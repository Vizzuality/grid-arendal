<h1>F. The Projections of the Earth's Future Climate</h1>
<p>The tools of climate models are used with future scenarios of forcing agents 
  (e.g., greenhouse gases and aerosols) as input to make a suite of projected 
  future climate changes that illustrates the possibilities that could lie ahead. 
  <a href="#f1">Section F.1</a> provides a description of the future scenarios 
  of forcing agents given in the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) 
  on which, wherever possible, the future changes presented in this section are 
  based. Sections <a href="030.htm#f2">F.2</a> to <a href="034.htm#f9">F.9</a> 
  present the resulting projections of changes to the future climate. Finally, 
  <a href="035.htm#f10">Section F.10</a> presents the results of future projections 
  based on scenarios of a future where greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilised.</p>
<a name="f1"></a> 
<h2>F.1 The IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES)</h2>
<p>In 1996, the IPCC began the development of a new set of emissions scenarios, 
  effectively to update and replace the well-known IS92 scenarios. The approved 
  new set of scenarios is described in the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios 
  (SRES). Four different narrative storylines were developed to describe consistently 
  the relationships between the forces driving emissions and their evolution and 
  to add context for the scenario quantification. The resulting set of 40 scenarios 
  (35 of which contain data on the full range of gases required to force climate 
  models) cover a wide range of the main demographic, economic and technological 
  driving forces of future greenhouse gas and sulphur emissions. Each scenario 
  represents a specific quantification of one of the four storylines. All the 
  scenarios based on the same storyline constitute a scenario "family" 
  (See <a href="#box5">Box 5</a>, which briefly describes the main characteristics 
  of the four SRES storylines and scenario families). The SRES scenarios do not 
  include additional climate initiatives, which means that no scenarios are included 
  that explicitly assume implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention 
  on Climate Change or the emissions targets of the Kyoto Protocol. However, greenhouse 
  gas emissions are directly affected by non-climate change policies designed 
  for a wide range of other purposes (e.g., air quality). Furthermore, government 
  policies can, to varying degrees, influence the greenhouse gas emission drivers, 
  such as demographic change, social and economic development, technological change, 
  resource use, and pollution management. This influence is broadly reflected 
  in the storylines and resulting scenarios.</p>

        Scenarios (SRES)</b><br>
      </p>
      <a name="storya1"></a> 
      <p>A1. The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of 
        very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century 
        and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient 
        technologies. Major underlying themes are convergence among regions, capacity 
        building and increased cultural and social interactions, with a substantial 
        reduction in regional differences in per capita income. The A1 scenario 
        family develops into three groups that describe alternative directions 
        of technological change in the energy system. The three A1 groups are 
        distinguished by their technological emphasis: fossil intensive (A1FI), 
        non-fossil energy sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources (A1B) 
        (where balanced is defined as not relying too heavily on one particular 
        energy source, on the assumption that similar improvement rates apply 
        to all energy supply and end-use technologies).</p>
      <a name="storya2"></a> 
      <p>A2. The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous 
        world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local 
        identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which 
        results in continuously increasing population. Economic development is 
        primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and technological 
        change more fragmented and slower than other storylines.</p>
      <a name="storyb1"></a> 
      <p>B1. The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world 
        with the same global population, that peaks in mid-century and declines 
        thereafter, as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid change in economic 
        structures toward a service and information economy, with reductions in 
        material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient 
        technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social 
        and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without 
        additional climate initiatives.</p>
      <a name="storyb2"></a> 
      <p>B2. The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the 
        emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability. 
        It is a world with continuously increasing global population, at a rate 
        lower than A2, intermediate levels of economic development, and less rapid 
        and more diverse technological change than in the A1 and B1 storylines. 
        While the scenario is also oriented towards environmental protection and 
        social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels.</p>

<p><a name="figTechSum17"></a>Since the SRES was not approved until 15 March 2000, 
  it was too late for the modelling community to incorporate the final approved 
  scenarios in their models and have the results available in time for this Third 
  Assessment Report. However, draft scenarios were released to climate modellers 
  earlier to facilitate their input to the Third Assessment Report, in accordance 
  with a decision of the IPCC Bureau in 1998. At that time, one marker scenario 
  was chosen from each of four of the scenario groups based directly on the storylines 
  (<a href="#storya1">A1B</a>, <a href="#storya2">A2</a>, <a href="#storyb1">B1</a>, 
  and <a href="#storyb2">B2</a>). The choice of the markers was based on which 
  of the initial quantifications best reflected the storyline and features of 
  specific models. Marker scenarios are no more or less likely than any other 
  scenarios, but are considered illustrative of a particular storyline. Scenarios 
  were also selected later to illustrate the other two scenario groups (<a href="#storya1">A1FI</a> 
  and <a href="#storya1">A1T</a>) within the <a href="#storya1">A1 family</a>, 
  which specifically explore alternative technology developments, holding the 
  other driving forces constant. Hence there is an illustrative scenario for each 
  of the six scenario groups, and all are equally plausible. Since the latter 
  two illustrative scenarios were selected at a late stage in the process, the 
  AOGCM modelling results presented in this report only use two of the four draft 
  marker scenarios. At present, only scenarios <a href="#storya2">A2</a> and <a href="#storyb2">B2</a> 
  have been integrated by more than one AOGCM. The AOGCM results have been augmented 
  by results from simple climate models that cover all six illustrative scenarios. 
  The IS92a scenario is also presented in a number of cases to provide direct 
  comparison with the results presented in the SAR.</p>
<p>The final four marker scenarios contained in the SRES differ in minor ways 
  from the draft scenarios used for the AOGCM experiments described in this report. 
  In order to ascertain the likely effect of differences in the draft and final 
  SRES scenarios, each of the four draft and final marker scenarios were studied 
  using a simple climate model. For three of the four marker scenarios (<a href="#storya1">A1B</a>, 
  <a href="#storya2">A2</a>, and <a href="#storyb2">B2</a>) temperature change 
  from the draft and marker scenarios are very similar. The primary difference 
  is a change to the standardised values for 1990 to 2000, which is common to 
  all these scenarios. This results in a higher forcing early in the period. There 
  are further small differences in net forcing, but these decrease until, by 2100, 
  differences in temperature change in the two versions of these scenarios are 
  in the range 1 to 2%. For the <a href="#storyb1">B1</a> scenario, however, temperature 
  change is significantly lower in the final version, leading to a difference 
  in the temperature change in 2100 of almost 20%, as a result of generally lower 
  emissions across the full range of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>Anthropogenic emissions of the three main greenhouse gases, CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, together with anthropogenic sulphur dioxide 
  emissions, are shown for the six illustrative SRES scenarios in <a href="#figTechSum17">Figure 
  17</a>. It is evident that these scenarios encompass a wide range of emissions. 
  For comparison, emissions are also shown for IS92a. Particularly noteworthy 
  are the much lower future sulphur dioxide emissions for the six SRES scenarios, 
  compared to the IS92 scenarios, due to structural changes in the energy system 
  as well as concerns about local and regional air pollution.</p>
