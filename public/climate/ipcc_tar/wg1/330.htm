<p><a name="fig821"></a>The atmosphere-ocean coupled system shows various modes 
  of variability that range widely from intra-seasonal to inter-decadal time-scales 
  (see <a href="048.htm">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="260.htm">7</a>). Since the 
  SAR, considerable progress has been achieved in characterising the decadal to 
  inter-decadal variability of the ocean-atmosphere system (Latif, 1998; Navarra, 
  1999). Successful evaluation of models over a wide range of phenomena increases 
  our confidence.</p>
<h3><a name="871"></a>8.7.1 El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</h3>
<p>ENSO is a phenomenon resulting from large-scale air-sea inter-actions (see 
  <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="303.htm">Section 7.6.5</a>). ENSO 
  modelling has advanced considerably since the SAR (e.g., Yukimoto et al., 1996; 
  Kimoto and Shen, 1997; Knutson et al., 1997; Timmermann et al., 1998). Some 
  models now use enhanced horizontal resolution in the tropics to better resolve 
  equatorial ocean dynamics. Models show SST variability in the tropical Pacific, 
  which has some similarity to observed ENSO as is shown in upper panels of <a href="#fig821">Figure 
  8.21</a>. However, some aspects of ENSO are still not well captured by present 
  day coupled models (Delecluse et al., 1998). Latif et al. (1999) analysed the 
  SST climatology and interannual variability simulated by twenty four models 
  in the equatorial Pacific. When compared with observations, the models have 
  flaws in reproducing the annual cycle. About half of the models are characterised 
  by too weak interannual variability in the eastern equatorial Pacific, while 
  models generally have larger variability in the central equatorial Pacific (<a href="319.htm#tab82">Table 
  8.2</a>). It was found that the majority of the models show the observed ENSO-monsoon 
  relationship, that is, a weak Indian summer monsoon tends to be associated with 
  El Ni&ntilde;o.</p>
<p>Seasonal forecasting with coupled global models has just begun (Barnston et 
  al., 1999; McPhaden, 1999), although few of the models discussed in <a href="338.htm">Chapter 
  9</a> are used. While forecast skill of coupled global models is still lower 
  than statistical models (Landsea and Knaff, 2000), coupled global models have 
  better skill than simple models. The 1997 to 1998 El Ni&ntilde;o event (Trenberth, 
  1998b) is a good test of coupled model forecast systems. <a href="#fig822">Figure 
  8.22</a> plots the SST anomaly during the 1997 to 1998 El Ni&ntilde;o for predictions 
  made with various initial conditions by prediction systems at ECMWF (Stockdale 
  et al., 1998), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) (Ishii et al., 1998), NCEP 
  (Barnston et al., 1999) and for the hindcast made at the Bureau of Meteorology 
  Research Centre (BMRC) (Wang et al., 2000). Those comprehensive models predicted 
  unusually warm tropical Pacific SST for 1997, albeit with underestimation of 
  the strength of the event and the warming speed. A similar conclusion is reached 
  with other global climate models (Oberhuber et al., 1998; Zhou et al., 1998). 
  Unusually strong Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO, see <a href="331.htm#874">Section 
  8.7.4</a>) and westerly wind bursts may have affected not only the timing but 
  also the amplitude of the 1997 to 1998 El Ni&ntilde;o (McPhaden, 1999; Moore 
  and Kleeman, 1999), and, in this respect, models may fail to forecast the onset 
  of an El Ni&ntilde;o in some circumstances. However, these results suggest an 
  improved ability of coupled models to forecast El Ni&ntilde;o if sufficient 
  data to initialise the model are available from a good ocean data assimilation 
  system.</p>
<p>In summary, the higher resolution coupled climate models employed since the 
  SAR are better able to simulate El Ni&ntilde;o-like SST variability in the tropical 
  Pacific. However, there still remain common model errors such as weaker amplitude 
  of SST anomalies and westward shift of the variability maximum compared to the 
  observations. Current models can predict major El Ni&ntilde;o events with some 
  accuracy, suggesting that, as the resolution increases and the model physics 
  improves, El Ni&ntilde;o simulation will also improve. </p>
<h3><a name="872"></a>8.7.2 Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)</h3>
<p>The leading mode in the Pacific with decadal time-scale is usually called the 
  Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="084.htm">Section 
  2.6.3</a>). Unlike the well-documented interannual mode (ENSO), the decadal 
  pattern does not have a distinctive equatorial maximum. Several coupled climate 
  models are able to reproduce a pattern of this decadal variability broadly similar 
  to the observed pattern (Latif and Barnett, 1996; Robertson, 1996; Yukimoto 
  et al., 1996, 2000; Knutson and Manabe, 1998; Yu et al., 2000a). These modelling 
  groups have proposed different mechanisms to explain the observed Pacific decadal 
  variability based on analysis of large samples of simulated decadal variability 
  in their coupled models. An example is shown in <a href="#fig821">Figure 8.21b</a>, 
  where larger SST variability in the North Pacific than in the equatorial region 
  is captured (Yukimoto, 1999). While the geographical location of the mid-latitude 
  poles and the amplitude ratio between the tropical and mid-latitude poles vary 
  slightly from one model to another, pattern correlation between the observed 
  and model leading decadal EOFs are quite high.</p>
