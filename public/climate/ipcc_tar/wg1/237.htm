<h3>6.7.7 Nitrate Aerosol</h3>
<p>Although IPCC (1994) identified nitrate aerosol as a significant anthropogenic 
  source of aerosol, only three estimates of the radiative forcing are available. 
  Van Dorland et al. (1997) has produced a very speculative radiative forcing 
  estimate of approximately -0.03 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for ammonium nitrate, while Adams et al. 
  (2001) derived a radiative forcing of -0.22 Wm<sup>-2</sup> from an anthropogenic burden 
  of 0.62 mg(NO<sub>3</sub>)m<sup>-2</sup>, and Jacobson (2001) derived a radiative forcing 
  of approximately -0.02 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for a column burden of 0.7 mg(NO<sub>3</sub>)m<sup>-2</sup>. 
  It appears that the large discrepancy between the results of Jacobson (2001) 
  and Adams et al. (2001) is that 90% of the nitrate is in the coarse mode in 
  Jacobson (2001), which reduces the scattering efficiency. Recent measurement 
  studies by Veefkind et al. (1996) and ten Brink et al. (1997) in the Netherlands 
  have shown that nitrate aerosol in the form of ammonium nitrate is a locally 
  important aerosol species in terms of aerosol mass in the optically active sub-micron 
  size range and hence the associated radiative forcing. They also emphasise the 
  problems in measuring the concentrations and size distributions of nitrate which 
  is a semi-volatile substance. The contradictory nature of the global studies 
  means that no "best estimate" or range for the radiative forcing due 
  to anthropogenic nitrate aerosol is presented in this report, though future 
  studies may prove that it exerts a significant radiative forcing.</p>
<h3><a name="678"></a>6.7.8 Discussion of Uncertainties</h3>
<p>While the radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases may be determined to a 
  reasonably high degree of accuracy (<a href="218.htm">Section 6.3</a>), the 
  uncertainties relating to aerosol radiative forcings remain large, and rely 
  to a large extent on the estimates from global modelling studies that are difficult 
  to verify at the present time. The range of estimates presented in this section 
  represents mainly the structural uncertainties (i.e., differences in the model 
  structures and assumptions) rather than the parametric uncertainties (i.e., 
  the uncertainties in the key parameters) (see Pan et al., 1997). This is because 
  many of the model calculations for sulphate aerosol use identical size distributions 
  and refractive indices which lead to identical optical parameters. Thus the 
  model results are not necessarily independent, and certainly do not include 
  the full range of parametric uncertainties. The response of the direct radiative 
  forcing to parametric uncertainties is investigated in sensitivity studies for 
  different aerosol species (e.g., Boucher and Anderson, 1995; Haywood and Ramaswamy, 
  1998). Three major areas of uncertainty exist; uncertainties in the atmospheric 
  burden and the anthropogenic contribution to it, uncertainties in the optical 
  parameters, and uncertainties in implementation of the optical parameters and 
  burden to give a radiative forcing. The atmospheric burden of an anthropogenic 
  aerosol species is determined by factors such as emission, aging, convective 
  transport, scavenging and deposition processes, each of which have an associated 
  uncertainty (see <a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a>). The optical parameters have 
  uncertainties associated with uncertainties in size distribution, chemical composition, 
  state of mixing, method of mixing, and asphericity. The problem of the degree 
  of external/internal mixing in the atmosphere deserves highlighting, as global 
  modelling studies tend to assume external mixtures which make modelling the 
  sources, atmospheric transport and radiative properties simpler (e.g., Tegen 
  et al., 1997). However, single particle analysis of particles containing mineral 
  dust (e.g., Levin et al., 1996) and sea salt (Murphy et al., 1998) have often 
  shown them to be internally mixed with sulphate and other aerosols of anthropogenic 
  origin. Thus, heterogeneous conversion of SO<sub>2</sub> to sulphate aerosol 
  on dust or sea salt particles may effectively lead to sulphate becoming internally 
  mixed with larger super-micron particles (e.g., Dentener et al., 1996) leading 
  to a reduction in extinction efficiency, an effect that has not yet been accounted 
  for in global modelling studies. Studies that model internal mixtures of absorbing 
  and scattering aerosols necessarily apply simplifying assumptions such as volume 
  weighting the refractive indices (e.g., Haywood et al., 1997a; Myhre et al., 
  1998c) which may overestimate the degree of absorption (e.g., Jacobson, 2000). 
  Modelling studies that examine the effects of internal mixing of multi-component 
  aerosols are only just becoming available (Jacobson, 2001). Uncertainties in 
  calculating the radiative forcing from specified burdens and optical parameters 
  arise from uncertainties in the parametrization of relative humidity effects, 
  the horizontal and vertical distributions of the aerosol, the uncertainties 
  and sub-grid scale effects in other model fields such as clouds, humidity, temperature 
  and surface reflectance, the representation of the diurnal cycle, and the accuracy 
  of the radiation code used in the calculations. The short atmospheric lifetime 
  of aerosols and the resultant large spatial variability imply a strong requirement 
  for global observational data. Until a reliable global observational method 
  for verifying the radiative effects of anthropogenic aerosols is available, 
  it is likely that the radiative forcing of any aerosol species will remain difficult 
  to quantify. Although satellite retrievals of aerosol optical properties have 
  advanced substantially since the SAR, the difficult problem of separating anthropogenic 
  from natural aerosol still remains (<a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a>). Nevertheless, 
  new analyses reiterate that global satellite measurements contain tropospheric 
  aerosol signatures that include those due to anthropogenic aerosols (Haywood 
  et al., 1999; Boucher and Tanr&eacute;, 2000). While the general spatial distribution 
  of the radiative forcing for sulphate aerosol appears to be similar among the 
  studies listed in <a href="232.htm#tab64">Table 6.4</a>, some important features, 
  such as the seasonal cycle in the radiative forcing, remain highly uncertain 
  which may have important consequences in terms of the detection and attribution 
  of climate change (<a href="439.htm">Chapter 12</a>).</p>
<p>Here we examine the consistency of the ranges derived in this section with 
  the ranges obtained using the approach of <a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="197.htm">Section 
  5.4.2</a>. For the industrial sulphate, fossil fuel BC, and fossil fuel OC aerosols, 
  the "best estimates" of the direct radiative forcing are -0.4 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup> with a factor of 2 uncertainty, +0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with a 
  factor of 2 uncertainty and -0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with a factor of 3 uncertainty, 
  respectively. An estimate of the total direct radiative forcing from industrial 
  aerosols (using RMS errors) leads to a range -0.07 to -1.24 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
  which is reasonably consistent with -0.1 to -1.0 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (one 
  standard deviation) from <a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="197.htm">Section 
  5.4.2</a>. For biomass burning aerosols the "best estimate" of the 
  direct radiative forcing is -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with a range -0.07 
  to -0.6 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, which is reasonably consistent with -0.1 
  to -0.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (one standard deviation) obtained from <a href="197.htm">Section 
  5.4.2</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, while this section has concentrated upon the radiative forcing 
  at the top of the atmosphere, the effects of anthropogenic aerosols upon the 
  radiative budget at the surface of the Earth has not been considered in detail. 
  For purely scattering aerosols in cloud-free conditions, the radiative effect 
  at the surface is within a few per cent of that at the top of the atmosphere 
  (e.g., Haywood and Shine, 1997). However, for partially absorbing aerosols, 
  the radiative effect at the surface may be many times that at the top of the 
  atmosphere, as evidenced by modelling and measurement studies (e.g., Haywood 
  and Shine, 1997; Haywood et al., 1999; <a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a>). This 
  is because, for partially absorbing aerosols, energy is transferred directly 
  to the atmospheric column. Ackerman et al. (2000) point out that this can warm 
  the atmosphere and "burn off" clouds. They conclude that during the 
  northeast monsoon (dry season over India) daytime trade cumulus cloud cover 
  over the northern Indian Ocean can be reduced by nearly half, although these 
  results depend strongly upon the meteorological conditions and modelling assumptions. 
  This process may also be important over the global domain as indicated by Hansen 
  et al. (1997a), as the climate sensitivity parameter (<a href="216.htm">Section 
  6.2</a>) may differ significantly for absorbing aerosols due to diabatic heating 
  in the aerosol layer modifying the temperature structure of the atmosphere, 
  which affects the formation of clouds. The vertical partitioning of the forcing 
  by absorbing aerosols is also a potentially important factor in determining 
  climatic changes at the surface (e.g., evaporation, soil moisture).</p>
