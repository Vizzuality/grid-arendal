<h2>5.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Aerosols have a direct radiative forcing because they scatter and absorb solar 
  and infrared radiation in the atmosphere. Aerosols also alter the formation 
  and precipitation efficiency of liquid- water, ice and mixed-phase clouds, thereby 
  causing an indirect radiative forcing associated with these changes in cloud 
  properties.</p>
<p> The quantification of aerosol radiative forcing is more complex than the quantification 
  of radiative forcing by greenhouse gases because aerosol mass and particle number 
  concentrations are highly variable in space and time. This variability is largely 
  due to the much shorter atmospheric lifetime of aerosols compared with the important 
  greenhouse gases. Spatially and temporally resolved information on the atmospheric 
  burden and radiative properties of aerosols is needed to estimate radiative 
  forcing. Important parameters are size distribution, change in size with relative 
  humidity, complex refractive index, and solubility of aerosol particles. Estimating 
  radiative forcing also requires an ability to distinguish natural and anthropogenic 
  aerosols.</p>
<p> The quantification of indirect radiative forcing by aerosols is especially 
  difficult. In addition to the variability in aerosol concentrations, some quite 
  complicated aerosol influences on cloud processes must be accurately modelled. 
  The warm (liquid- water) cloud indirect forcing may be divided into two components. 
  The first indirect forcing is associated with the change in droplet concentration 
  caused by increases in aerosol cloud condensation nuclei. The second indirect 
  forcing is associated with the change in precipitation efficiency that results 
  from a change in droplet number concentration. Quantification of the latter 
  forcing necessitates understanding of a change in cloud liquid-water content 
  and cloud amount. In addition to warm clouds, ice clouds may also be affected 
  by aerosols.</p>
<h3><a name="511"></a>5.1.1 Advances since the Second Assessment Report</h3>
<p>Considerable progress in understanding the effects of aerosols on radiative 
  balances in the atmosphere has been made since the IPCC WGI Second Assessment 
  Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR). A variety of field studies have taken place, 
  providing both process-level understanding and a descriptive understanding of 
  the aerosols in different regions. In addition, a variety of aerosol networks 
  and satellite analyses have provided observations of regional differences in 
  aerosol characteristics. Improved instrumentation is available for measurements 
  of the chemical composition of single particles. </p>
<p> Models of aerosols have significantly improved since the SAR. Because global 
  scale observations are not available for many aerosol properties, models are 
  essential for interpolating and extrapolating available data to the global scale. 
  Although there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with their use, models 
  are presently the only tools with which to study past or future aerosol distributions 
  and properties.<br>
</p>
<p> The very simplest models represent the global atmosphere as a single box in 
  steady state for which the burden can be derived if estimates of sources and 
  lifetimes are available. This approach was used in early assessments of the 
  climatic effect of aerosols (e.g., Charlson et al., 1987, 1992; Penner et al., 
  1992; Andreae, 1995) since the information and modelling tools to provide a 
  spatially- and temporally-resolved analysis were not available at the time. 
  At the time of the SAR, three-dimensional models were only available for sulphate 
  aerosols and soot. Since then, three-dimensional aerosol models have been developed 
  for carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning and from fossil fuels (Liousse 
  et al., 1996; Cooke and Wilson, 1996; Cooke et al., 1999), dust aerosols (Tegen 
  and Fung, 1994; Tegen et al., 1996), sea salt aerosol (Gong et al., 1998) and 
  nitrate and ammonia in aerosols (Adams et al., 1999, 2001; Penner et al., 1999a). 
  In this report, the focus is on a temporally and spatially resolved analysis 
  of the atmospheric concentrations of aerosols and their radiative properties.</p>
