<h4>9.3.5.1 Intra-seasonal variability Daily precipitation variability</h4>
<p>Changes in daily variability of temperature and rainfall are most obviously 
  manifest in changes in extreme events and much of the work in this area will 
  be discussed in the extreme events section (<a href="364.htm">Section 9.3.6</a>). 
  However, changes in short time-scale variability do not necessarily only imply 
  changes in extreme weather. More subtle changes in daily variability, when integrated 
  over time, could still have important socio-economic impacts. Hennessey et al. 
  (1997) found that the simulated number of wet days (days where the rainfall 
  is non-zero) in two mixed-layer models went down in mid-latitudes and up in 
  high latitudes when CO<sub>2</sub> was doubled, whilst the mean precipitation increased 
  in both areas. The global mean precipitation also increased, by around 10% in 
  both models, typical of the changes in many mixed-layer models on doubling CO<sub>2</sub>. 
  An analysis of changes in daily precipitation variability in a coupled model 
  (Durman et al., 2001) suggests a similar reduction in wet days over Europe where 
  the increase in precipitation efficiency exceeds the increase in mean precipitation. 
</p>
<p><i>Circulation patterns </i><br>
  Kattenberg et al. (1996) reported research on changes in inter-monthly temperatures 
  and precipitation variability from two coupled models (Meehl et al, 1994; Parey, 
  1994). More recently, there have been several studies looking at changes in 
  intra-seasonal circulation patterns using higher resolution atmosphere-only 
  models with projected SSTs taken from coupled models at given time periods in 
  the future (e.g., Beersma et al., 1997; Schubert et al., 1998). The effects 
  of changes in extra-tropical storms on extreme wind and precipitation events 
  are described in <a href="364.htm">Section 9.3.6</a>, but there has also been 
  work on changes in lower-frequency variability such as persistent or "blocking" 
  anti-cyclones. As discussed in the SAR, there still seems to be little consensus 
  on the methodology for looking at changes in storms and blocks and it is likely 
  that this is partly the reason for the lack of consistency in results. In new 
  studies, Lupo et al. (1997) looked at the effect of doubled CO<sub>2</sub> on several of 
  the characteristics of blocking. They found an increase in the number of continental 
  blocks and a general increase in the persistence of blocks, but with weakened 
  amplitude. In contrast, Carnell and Senior (1998) found the largest change was 
  a decrease in blocking in the North Pacific Ocean in winter in their model. 
  Earlier studies have pointed to the possible model dependency of results (Bates 
  and Meehl, 1986) and Carnell and Senior (2000) suggest that the changes in blocking 
  found in their earlier study (Carnell and Senior, 1998) may depend on the meridional 
  gradient of temperature change in the model, which may in turn depend on the 
  simulation of cloud feedback in their model. Zhang and Wang (1997) found a decrease 
  in the total number of Northern Hemisphere winter anticyclones under increased 
  greenhouse gases, although they did not specifically look at blocking anticyclones. 
</p>
<p>Fyfe (1999) has looked at changes in African easterly waves due to a doubling 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> in one model. Significant low-level warming and increases in atmospheric 
  humidity over the Northern Sahara lead to an increase in the easterly wave activity. 
  Again, these results must be considered speculative given the relatively low 
  resolution of the model (T32, about 3.5&deg; res-olution), which leads to substantial 
  systematic biases in the present day simulation of the low-level storm track 
  in the region. </p>
