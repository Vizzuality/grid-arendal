<p><i>Continued from previous page</i></p>
<p>The following findings from the models analysed in this chapter corroborate 
  results from the SAR (projections of regional climate change are given in <a href="373.htm">Chapter 
  10</a>) for all scenarios considered. We assign these to be virtually certain 
  to very likely (defined as agreement among most models, or, where only a small 
  number of models have been analysed and their results are physically plausible, 
  these have been assessed to characterise those from a larger number of models). 
  The more recent results are generally obtained from models with improved parametrizations 
  (e.g., better land-surface process schemes).</p>
<ul>
  <li>The troposphere warms, stratosphere cools, and near surface temperature 
    warms.</li>
  <li>Generally, the land warms faster than the ocean, the land warms more than 
    the ocean after forcing stabilises, and there is greater relative warming 
    at high latitudes.</li>
  <li>The cooling effect of tropospheric aerosols moderates warming both globally 
    and locally, which mitigates the increase in SAT.</li>
  <li>The SAT increase is smaller in the North Atlantic and circumpolar Southern 
    Ocean regions relative to the global mean.</li>
  <li>As the climate warms, Northern Hemisphere snow cover and sea-ice extent 
    decrease. </li>
  <li>The globally averaged mean water vapour, evaporation and precipitation increase.</li>
  <li>Most tropical areas have increased mean precipitation, most of the sub-tropical 
    areas have decreased mean precipitation, and in the high latitudes the mean 
    precipitation increases.</li>
  <li>Intensity of rainfall events increases.</li>
  <li>There is a general drying of the mid-continental areas during summer (decreases 
    in soil moisture). This is ascribed to a combination of increased temperature 
    and potential evaporation that is not balanced by increases in precipitation.</li>
  <li>A majority of models show a mean El Ni&ntilde;o-like response in the tropical 
    Pacific, with the central and eastern equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures 
    warming more than the western equatorial Pacific, with a corresponding mean 
    eastward shift of precipitation.</li>
  <li>Available studies indicate enhanced interannual variability of northern 
    summer monsoon precipitation.</li>
  <li>With an increase in the mean surface air temperature, there are more frequent 
    extreme high maximum temperatures and less frequent extreme low minimum temperatures. 
    There is a decrease in diurnal temperature range in many areas, with night-time 
    lows increasing more than daytime highs. A number of models show a general 
    decrease in daily variability of surface air temperature in winter, and increased 
    daily variability in summer in the Northern Hemisphere land areas. </li>
  <li>The multi-model ensemble signal to noise ratio is greater for surface air 
    temperature than for precipitation.</li>
  <li>Most models show weakening of the Northern Hemisphere thermohaline circulation 
    (THC), which contributes to a reduction in the surface warming in the northern 
    North Atlantic. Even in models where the THC weakens, there is still a warming 
    over Europe due to increased greenhouse gases.</li>
  <li>The deep ocean has a very long thermodynamic response time to any changes 
    in radiative forcing; over the next century, heat anomalies penetrate to depth 
    mainly at high latitudes where mixing is greatest.</li>
</ul>
<p>A second category of results assessed here are those that are new since the 
  SAR, and we ascribe these to be very likely (as defined above):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The range of the TCR is limited by the compensation between the effective 
    climate sensitivity (ECS) and ocean heat uptake. For instance, a large ECS, 
    implying a large temperature change, is offset by a comparatively large heat 
    flux into the ocean. </li>
  <li>Including the direct effect of sulphate aerosols (IS92a or similar) reduces 
    global mean mid-21st century warming (though there are uncertainties involved 
    with sulphate aerosol forcing - see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>). 
  </li>
  <li>Projections of climate for the next 100 years have a large range due both 
    to the differences of model responses and the range of emission scenarios. 
    Choice of model makes a difference comparable to choice of scenario considered 
    here.</li>
  <li>In experiments where the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration is stabilised 
    at twice its present day value, the North Atlantic THC recovers from initial 
    weakening within one to several centuries.</li>
  <li>The increases in surface air temperature and surface absolute humidity result 
    in even larger increases in the heat index (a measure of the combined effects 
    of temperature and moisture). The increases in surface air temperature also 
    result in an increase in the annual cooling degree days and a decrease in 
    heating degree days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional new results since the SAR; these are assessed to be likely due to 
  many (but not most) models showing a given result, or a small number of models 
  showing a physically plausible result.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Areas of increased 20 year return values of daily maximum temperature events 
    are largest mainly in areas where soil moisture decreases; increases in return 
    values of daily minimum temperature especially occur over most land areas 
    and are generally larger where snow and sea ice retreat.</li>
  <li>Precipitation extremes increase more than does the mean and the return period 
    for extreme precipitation events decreases almost everywhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another category includes results from a limited number of studies which are 
  new, less certain, or unresolved, and we assess these to have medium likelihood, 
  though they remain physically plausible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Although the North Atlantic THC weakens in most models, the relative roles 
    of surface heat and freshwater fluxes vary from model to model. Wind stress 
    changes appear to play only a minor role.</li>
  <li>It appears that a collapse in the THC by the year 2100 is less likely than 
    previously discussed in the SAR, based on the AOGCM results to date.</li>
  <li>Beyond 2100, the THC could completely shut-down, possibly irreversibly, 
    in either hemisphere if the rate of change of radiative forcing was large 
    enough and applied long enough. The implications of a complete shut-down of 
    the THC have not been fully explored.</li>
  <li>Although many models show an El Ni&ntilde;o-like change in the mean state 
    of tropical Pacific SSTs, the cause is uncertain. It has been related to changes 
    in the cloud radiative forcing and/or evaporative damping of the east-west 
    SST gradient in some models.</li>
  <li>Future changes in El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) interannual 
    variability differ from model to model. In models that show increases, this 
    is related to an increase in thermocline intensity, but other models show 
    no significant change and there are considerable uncertainties due to model 
    limitations of simulating ENSO in the current generation of AOGCMs (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 
    8</a>).</li>
  <li>Several models produce less of the weak but more of the deeper mid-latitude 
    lows, meaning a reduced total number of storms. Techniques are being pioneered 
    to study the mechanisms of the changes and of variability, but general agreement 
    among models has not been reached.</li>
  <li>There is some evidence that shows only small changes in the frequency of 
    tropical cyclones derived from large-scale parameters related to tropical 
    cyclone genesis, though some measures of intensities show increases, and some 
    theoretical and modelling studies suggest that upper limit intensities could 
    increase (for further discussion see <a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>).</li>
  <li>There is no clear agreement concerning the changes in frequency or structure 
    of naturally occurring modes of variability such as the North Atlantic Oscillation</li>
</ul>
