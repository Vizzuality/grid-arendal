      trends are represented by the area of the circle with green representing 
      increases and brown representing decreases. Annual and seasonal trends were 
      calculated using the following method. Precipitation anomalies in physical 
      units were calculated for each station based on 1961 to 1990 normals and 
      averaged into 5&deg; x 5&deg; grid cells on a monthly basis. The 1961 
      to 1990 monthly mean precipitation for each grid cell was added to the monthly 
      anomalies and the resulting grid cell values summed into annual and seasonal 
      totals. This series was converted into percentages of normal precipitation, 
      and trends calculated from the percentages. Average trends within six latitude 
      bands (85&deg;N to 55&deg;N, 55&deg;N to 30&deg;N, 30&deg;N to 10&deg;N, 
      10&deg;N to 10&deg;S, 10&deg;S to 30&deg;S, 30&deg;S to 55&deg;S) are shown 
      in the legend of each map. The 1961 to 1990 monthly mean precipitation for 
      the latitude band was added to the anomaly time-series and the resulting 
      values totalled across all months within the season or year. The significance 
      of each trend (based on a 5% level) was determined using a t-test and a 
      non-parametric test statistic. Trends found to be significant under both 
      tests are indicated with an asterisk.</td>

      to 1999. During the 100-year periods, calculation of grid cell trends required 
      at least 66% of the years without missing data and at least three years 
      of data within each decade except the first and last. During the shorter 
      periods, calculation of grid cell trends required at least 75% of the years 
      without missing data. Stations with more than one sixth of their data missing 
      during the normal period and grid cells with more than one season or year 
      without any measurable precipitation during the normal period were excluded

<p>Overall, global land precipitation has increased by about 2% since the beginning 
  of the 20th century (Jones and Hulme, 1996; Hulme et al., 1998). The increase 
  is statistically significant but has been neither spatially nor temporally uniform 
  (Karl and Knight, 1998; Doherty et al., 1999). Dai et al. (1997b) found a global 
  secular increase in precipitation separate from ENSO and other modes of variability. 
  Data from over 20,000 stations contributed to the changes since 1900 shown in 
  <a href="#fig225i">Figure 2.25</a>. The effects of changes in windshields 
  on winter precipitation measurements were taken into account for most mid- and 
  high latitude observations. Dai et al. (1997b) indicated that instrumental discontinuities 
  are unlikely to significantly impact other observations. </p>
<p><i>Mid- and high latitudes</i><br>
  Over the 20th century, annual zonally averaged precipitation increased by between 
  7 to 12% for the zones 30&deg;N to 85&deg;N and by about 2% between 0&deg;S 
  to 55&deg;S (<a href="#fig225ii">Figure 2.25(ii)</a>). The increase in 
  the Northern Hemisphere is likely to be slightly biased because adjustments 
  have not been made for the increasing fraction of precipitation falling in liquid 
  as opposed to frozen form. The exact rate of precipitation increase depends 
  on the method of calculating the changes, but the bias is expected to be small 
  because the amount of annual precipitation affected by this trend is generally 
  only about a few per cent. Nevertheless, this unsteady, but highly statistically 
  significant trend toward more precipitation in many of these regions is continuing. 
  For example, in 1998 the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes (55&deg;N and higher) 
  had their wettest year on record and the mid-latitudes have had precipitation 
  totals exceeding the 1961 to 1990 mean every year since 1995. </p>
<p>Figure 2.25(i) shows mostly increasing precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere 
  mid- and high latitudes, especially during the autumn and winter, but these 
  increases vary both spatially and temporally. For example, precipitation over 
  the United States has increased by between 5 to 10% since 1900 (<a href="#fig225ii">Figure 
  2.25(ii)</a>) but this increase has been interrupted by multi-year anomalies 
  such as the drought years of the 1930s and early 1950s (Karl and Knight, 1998; 
  Groisman et al., 1999). The increase is most pronounced during the warm seasons. 
  Using data selected to be relatively free of anthropogenic influences such as 
  ground water pumpage or land use changes, several recent analyses (Lettenmaier 
  et al., 1999; Lins and Slack, 1999; Groisman et al., 2001) have detected increases 
  in streamflow across much of the contiguous United States, confirming the general 
  tendency to increasing precipitation. However, Lins and Michaels (1994) found 
  in some regions that increased streamflow did not relate well to an increase 
  in rainfall. This has been further evaluated by Groisman et al. (2001) who show 
  that changes in snow-cover extent also influence the timing and volume of streamflow.</p>
<p>Regionally, Mekis and Hogg (1999) showed that precipitation in Canada has increased 
  by an average of more than 10% over the 20th century. Zhang et al. (2000) report 
  an increase in Canadian heavy snowfall amounts north of 55&deg;N and Akinremi 
  et al. (1999) found rainfall significantly increasing in the Canadian prairies 
  from 1956 to 1995. Multi-decadal streamflow data in Canada are not extensive, 
  but there are no apparent inconsistencies between observed changes in streamflow 
  or precipitation (Zhang et al., 2000).</p>
<p>Over the last 50 years there has been a slight decrease 
  in annual precipitation over China (Zhai et al., 1999a), which is supported 
  by a significant (5% confidence level) decrease in the number of rainy days 
  (3.9%/decade; Figure 2.25 (ii)). In contrast, the area affected by the upper 
  10% of heaviest precipitation has significantly increased. Zhai et al. (1999b) 
  show a significant increase in precipitation over the middle and lower reaches 
  of the Yangtze River and west China during the latter part of the 20th century, 
  while also detecting a declining trend in precipitation over northern China.</p>
<p>There have been marked increases in precipitation in the latter part of the 
  20th century over northern Europe, with a general decrease southward to the 
  Mediterranean (Sch&ouml;nwiese and Rapp, 1997; <a href="#fig225i">Figure 
  2.25(i)</a>). Dry wintertime conditions over southern Europe and the Mediterranean 
  (Piervitali et al., 1998; Romero et al., 1998) and wetter than normal conditions 
  over many parts of northern Europe and Scandinavia (Hanssen-Bauer and F&oslash;rland, 
  2000) are linked to strong positive values of the North Atlantic Oscillation, 
  with more anticyclonic conditions over southern Europe and stronger westerlies 
  over northern Europe (<a href="086.htm#265">Section 2.6.5</a>). </p>
<p>Based on recent research (Bogdanova and Mescherskaya, 1998; Groisman and Rankova, 
  2001), the precipitation trend for the last century over the former USSR as 
  reported by the SAR was slightly overestimated. The new results indicate that 
  precipitation has increased since 1891 by about 5% west of 90&deg;E for both 
  warm and cold seasons. Georgievsky et al. (1996) also noted increases in precipitation 
  over the last several decades over western Russia, accompanied by increases 
  in streamflow and a rise in the level of the Caspian Sea. In eastern Russia 
  a negative precipitation trend since 1945 is embedded in the century-long positive 
  precipitation trend (<a href="#fig225ii">Figure 2.25(ii)</a>; Gruza et 
  al., 1999). Soil moisture data for large regions of Eurasia (Robock et al., 
  2000) show large upward trends. The rate of increase is more than 1 cm/decade 
  in the available soil moisture in the top 1 m of soil. These large positive 
  trends occur simultaneously with positive trends in temperature that would normally 
  reduce soil moisture. Increases in precipitation (and cloud cover, <a href="082.htm#255">Section 
  2.5.5</a>) are believed to have more than compensated for the increased losses 
  due to evapotranspiration. </p>
<p>An analysis of rainfall data since 1910 by Haylock and Nicholls (2000) reveals 
  a large decrease in total precipitation and related rain days in south-western 
  Australia. Annual total rainfall has increased over much of Australia with significant 
  increases of 15 to 20% in large areas. The increase in total rainfall has been 
  accompanied by a significant 10% rise in the average number of rain days over 
  Australia (Hennessy et al., 1999). Elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere, a long-term 
  increase in precipitation in Argentina has been observed for the period 1900 
  to 1998 (<a href="#fig225i">Figure 2.25(i)</a>; Dai et al., 1997b).</p>
<p><i>Tropics and sub-tropics</i><br>
  The increase in precipitation in the mid- and high latitudes contrasts with 
  decreases in the northern sub-tropics (with marginal statistical significance) 
  which were largely responsible for the decade-long reduction in global land 
  precipitation from the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s. Since the SAR, record 
  low precipitation has been observed in equatorial regions, while the sub-tropics 
  have recovered from their anomalously low values of the 1980s. </p>
<p>Regionally positive but non-significant trends have occurred in the rainy season 
  rainfall in north-east Brazil and northern Amazonia (Marengo et al., 1998). 
  River data from northern Amazonia indicate wetter periods in the mid-1970s, 
  and in 1990, as well as drier periods between 1980 to 1990, consistent with 
  rainfall anomalies. Northern Amazonian rainfall appears to be modulated by multi-decadal 
  climate variations. </p>
<p>There is little evidence for a long-term trend in Indian monsoonal rainfall 
  but there are multi-decadal variations (Kumar et al., 1999a,b). From 1906 to 
  about 1960, monsoonal rainfall increased then decreased through 1974 and has 
  increased since (see <a href="083.htm#26">Section 2.6</a>). In central America 
  for much of the period from the early 1940s to present, western Mexico has experienced 
  an increasingly erratic monsoonal rainfall (Douglas and Englehart, 1999).</p>
<p>Since 1976, increases in precipitation in the South Pacific have occurred to 
  the north-east of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) while decreases 
  have occurred to its south-west (Salinger et al., 1996). Manton et al. (2001) 
  found significant decreases in rain days since 1961 throughout Southeast Asia 
  and western and central South Pacific, but increases in the north of French 
  Polynesia and Fiji.</p>
<p>Streamflow data for major rivers in south-eastern South America for the period 
  1901 to 1995 show that streamflow has increased since the mid-1960s, and was 
  accompanied by a significant decrease in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle 
  of most of those rivers (Garcia and Vargas, 1998; Genta et al., 1998). <a href="#fig225i">Figure 
  2.25(i)</a> shows increases in precipitation since 1900 along the South American 
  eastern coastal areas, with less extensive increases since 1976.</p>
<p>There has been a pattern of continued aridity since the late 1960s throughout 
  North Africa south of the Sahara. This pattern is most persistent in the western 
  region. The driest period was in the 1980s with some recovery occurring during 
  the 1990s, particularly in the easternmost sectors where rainfall in some years 
  was near or just above the long-term mean (Nicholson et al., 2000). Southern 
  Africa was relatively moist in the 1950s and 1970s (Nicholson et al., 2000); 
  but Hulme (1996) found significant decreases in precipitation being observed 
  since the late 1970s. Early 2000, however, has seen flood-producing rains in 
  the eastern part of southern Africa.</p>
