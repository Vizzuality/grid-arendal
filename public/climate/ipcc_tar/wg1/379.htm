<h3>10.2.2 High Resolution and Variable Resolution AGCM Experiments </h3>
<p>Though simulations of many centuries are required to fully integrate the global 
  climate system, for many applications regional information on climate or climate 
  change is required for at most several decades. Over these time-scales AGCM, 
  simulations are feasible at resolutions of the order of 100 km globally, or 
  50 km locally, with variable resolution models. This suggests identifying periods 
  of interest within AOGCM transient simulations and modelling these with a higher 
  resolution or variable resolution AGCM to provide additional spatial detail 
  (e.g., Bengtsson et. al., 1995; Cubasch et al., 1995; D&egrave;qu&egrave; and 
  Piedelievre, 1995).</p>
<p>Here the AGCM is used to provide a reinterpretation of the atmospheric response 
  to the anomalous atmospheric forcing (from GHG and aerosols) experienced in 
  a transient AOGCM simulation. Hence, both this forcing and its accumulated effect 
  on the ocean surface have to be provided to the AGCM. In a typical experiment 
  (e.g., May and Roeckner, 2001), two time slices, say 1961 to 1990 and 2071 to 
  2100, are selected from a transient AOGCM simulation. The simulations include 
  prescribed time-dependent GHG and aerosol concentrations as in the corresponding 
  periods of the AOGCM run. Also prescribed as lower boundary conditions are the 
  time-dependent Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and sea-ice distributions simulated 
  by the AOGCM. The AGCM simulations are initialised using atmospheric and land-surface 
  conditions interpolated from the corresponding AOGCM fields.<br>
  Alternative experimental designs may be more appropriate. Large systematic errors 
  in the AOGCM simulation of SST and sea ice may induce significant biases in 
  the climatology of the AGCM. In this case, observed SSTs and sea-ice distributions 
  could be used for the present day simulation and changes derived from the AOGCM 
  experiment can be added to provide the forcing for the anomaly simulation. If 
  the AOGCM calculates the aerosol concentrations from prescribed sources then 
  the AGCM may use the same method. This has the advantage of providing aerosol 
  concentrations consistent with the AGCM circulations, although its global and 
  regional effects may be different from those in the AOGCM.</p>
<p>The philosophy behind the use of high or variable resolution AGCM simulations 
  is that, given the SST, sea ice, trace gas and aerosol forcing, relatively high-resolution 
  information can be obtained globally or regionally without having to perform 
  the whole transient simulation with high resolution models. The main theoretical 
  advantage of this approach is that the resulting simulations are globally consistent, 
  capturing remote responses to the impact of higher resolution. The use of higher 
  resolution can lead to improved simulation of the general circulation in addition 
  to providing regional detail (e.g., HIRETYCS, 1998; Stratton, 1999a).</p>
<p>In general, AGCMs will evolve their own planetary scale climatology. Therefore, 
  in a climate change simulation they are providing a reinterpretation of the 
  impact on the atmosphere of the sea surface and radiative forcings compared 
  to that given by the driving AOGCM. This may lead to inconsistency with the 
  AOGCM-derived forcing. This issue has yet to be explored but should be considered 
  carefully when interpreting AGCM responses. It would be of less concern if a 
  model simulation of the resolved planetary scale variables were asymptoting 
  to a solution as resolution increased, i.e., if the solution would not change 
  fundamentally in character with resolution but just add extra detail at the 
  finer scales. Evidence shows that this is not the case at the current resolution 
  of AOGCMs (Williamson, 1999).</p>
<p>A current weakness of high resolution AGCMs is that they generally use the 
  same formulations as at the coarse resolution for which these have been optimised 
  to reproduce current climate. Some processes may be represented less accurately 
  when finer scales are resolved and so the model formulations would need to be 
  optimised for use at higher resolution. Experience with high resolution GCMs 
  is still limited, so that, at present, increasing the resolution of an AGCM 
  generally both enhances and degrades different aspects of the simulations. With 
  global variable resolution models, this issue is further complicated as the 
  model physics parametrizations have to be designed in such a way that they can 
  be valid, and function correctly, over the range of resolutions covered by the 
  model. <br>
  Another issue concerning the use of variable resolution models is that feedback 
  effects from fine scales to larger scales are represented only as generated 
  by the region of interest. Conversely, in the real atmosphere, feedbacks derive 
  from different regions and interact with each other so that a variable resolution 
  model, based on a single high resolution region, might give an improper description 
  of fine-to-coarse scale feedbacks. In addition, a sufficient minimal resolution 
  must be retained outside the high resolution area of interest in order to prevent 
  a degradation of the simulation of the whole global system.</p>
<p>Use of high resolution and variable resolution global models is computationally 
  very demanding, which poses limits to the increase in resolution obtainable 
  with this method. However, it has been suggested that high-resolution AGCMs 
  could be used to obtain forcing fields for higher resolution RCMs or statistical 
  downscaling, thus effectively providing an intermediate step between AOGCMs 
  and regional and empirical models.</p>
