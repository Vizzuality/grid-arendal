<h2>Executive Summary </h2>
<p>This chapter evaluates the suitability of models (in particular coupled atmosphere-ocean 
  general circulation models) for use in climate change projection and in detection 
  and attribution studies. We concentrate on the variables and time-scales that 
  are important for this task. Models are evaluated against observations and differences 
  between models are explored using information from a number of systematic model 
  intercomparisons. Even if a model is assessed as performing credibly when simulating 
  the present climate, this does not necessarily guarantee that the response to 
  a perturbation remains credible. Therefore, we also assess the performance of 
  the models in simulating the climate over the 20th century and for selected 
  palaeoclimates. Incremental improvements in the performance of coupled models 
  have occurred since the IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter 
  SAR) resulting from advances in the modelling of the atmosphere, ocean, sea 
  ice and land surface as well as improvements in the coupling of these components. 
</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Coupled models can provide credible simulations of both the present annual 
    mean climate and the climatological seasonal cycle over broad continental 
    scales for most variables of interest for climate change. Clouds and humidity 
    remain sources of significant uncertainty but there have been incremental 
    improvements in simulations of these quantities.</li>
  <li>Confidence in model projections is increased by the improved performance 
    of several models that do not use flux adjustment. These models now maintain 
    stable, multi-century simulations of surface climate that are considered to 
    be of sufficient quality to allow their use for climate change projections. 
  </li>
  <li>There is no systematic difference between flux adjusted and non-flux adjusted 
    models in the simulation of internal climate variability. This supports the 
    use of both types of model in detection and attribution of climate change.</li>
  <li>Confidence in the ability of models to project future climates is increased 
    by the ability of several models to reproduce the warming trend in 20th century 
    surface air temperature when driven by radiative forcing due to increasing 
    greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols. However, only idealised scenarios 
    of only sulphate aerosols have been used.</li>
  <li>Some modelling studies suggest that inclusion of additional forcings such 
    as solar variability and volcanic aerosols may improve some aspects of the 
    simulated climate variability of the 20th century.</li>
  <li>Confidence in simulating future climates has been enhanced following a systematic 
    evaluation of models under a limited number of past climates.</li>
  <li>The performance of coupled models in simulating the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern 
    Oscillation (ENSO) has improved; however, the region of maximum sea surface 
    temperature variability associated with El Ni&ntilde;o events is displaced 
    westward and its strength is generally underestimated. When suitably initialised 
    with an ocean data assimilation system, some coupled models have had a degree 
    of success in predicting El Ni&ntilde;o events. </li>
  <li>Other phenomena previously not well simulated in coupled models are now 
    handled reasonably well, including monsoons and the North Atlantic Oscillation.</li>
  <li>Some palaeoclimate modelling studies, and some land-surface experiments 
    (including deforestation, desertification and land cover change), have revealed 
    the importance of vegetation feedbacks at sub-continental scales. Whether 
    or not vegetation changes are important for future climate projections should 
    be investigated. </li>
  <li>Analysis of, and confidence in, extreme events simulated within climate 
    models is emerging, particularly for storm tracks and storm frequency. "Tropical 
    cyclone-like" vortices are being simulated in climate models, although 
    enough uncertainty remains over their interpretation to warrant caution in 
    projections of tropical cyclone changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Final Assessment</p>
<p>Coupled models have evolved and improved significantly since the SAR. In general, 
  they provide credible simulations of climate, at least down to sub-continental 
  scales and over temporal scales from seasonal to decadal. The varying sets of 
  strengths and weaknesses that models display lead us to conclude that no single 
  model can be considered "best" and it is important to utilise results 
  from a range of coupled models. We consider coupled models, as a class, to be 
  suitable tools to provide useful projections of future climates.</p>
