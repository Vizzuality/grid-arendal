<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p><i>Two important new findings since the IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 
  1996) (hereafter SAR) demonstrate the importance of atmospheric chemistry in 
  controlling greenhouse gases:</i></p>
<p>Currently, tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is the third most important greenhouse 
  gas after carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). It is 
  a product of photochemistry, and its future abundance is controlled primarily 
  by emissions of CH<sub>4</sub>, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), 
  and volatile organic compounds (VOC). There is now greater confidence in the 
  model assessment of the increase in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> since the pre-industrial 
  period, which amounts to 30% when globally averaged, as well as the response 
  to future emissions. For scenarios in which the CH<sub>4</sub> abundance doubles 
  and anthropogenic CO and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions triple, the tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  abundance is predicted to increase by an additional 50% above today's abundance.</p>
<p>CO is identified as an important indirect greenhouse gas. An addition of CO 
  to the atmosphere perturbs the OH-CH<sub>4</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> chemistry. Model 
  calculations indicate that the emission of 100 Mt of CO stimulates an atmospheric 
  chemistry perturbation that is equivalent to direct emission of about 5 Mt of 
  CH<sub>4</sub>. </p>
<p><i>A major conclusion of this report is that atmospheric abundances of almost 
  all greenhouse gases reached the highest values in their measurement records 
  during the 1990s: </i></p>
<p>The atmospheric abundance of CH<sub>4</sub> continues to increase, from about 
  1,520 ppb in 1978 to 1,745 ppb in 1998. However, the observed annual increase 
  in CH<sub>4</sub> has declined during the last two decades. This increase is 
  highly variable; it was near zero in 1992 and as large as +13 ppb during 1998. 
  There is no clear, quantitative explanation for this variability. Since the 
  SAR, quantification of certain anthropogenic sources of CH<sub>4</sub>, such 
  as that from rice production, has improved.</p>
<p>The atmospheric burden of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) continues to increase 
  by about 0.25%/yr. New, higher estimates of emissions from agricultural sources 
  improve our understanding of the global N<sub>2</sub>O budget.</p>
<p>The atmospheric abundances of major greenhouse gases that deplete stratospheric 
  ozone are decreasing (CFC-11, CFC-113, CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub>, CCl<sub>4</sub>), 
  or increasing more slowly (CFC-12), in response to the phase-out in their production 
  agreed to under the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments. </p>
<p>HFC-152a and HFC-134a are increasing in the atmosphere. This growth is consistent 
  with the rise in their industrial use. HFC-23, an unintended by-product of HCFC-22 
  production, is also increasing.</p>
<p>Perfluorocarbon (PFC) e.g., CF<sub>4</sub> (perfluoromethane) appears to have 
  a natural background; however, current anthropogenic emissions exceed natural 
  ones by a factor of 1,000 or more and are responsible for the observed increase.</p>
<p>There is good agreement between the increase in atmospheric abundances of sulphur 
  hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) and emissions estimates based on revised sales 
  and storage data.</p>
<p>There has been little increase in global tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> since the 
  1980s at the few remote locations where it is regularly measured. Only two of 
  the fourteen stations, one in Japan and one in Europe, had statistically significant 
  increases in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> between 1980 and 1995. By contrast, 
  the four Canadian stations, all at high latitudes, had significant decreases 
  in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> for the same time period. However, limited observations 
  from the late 19th and early 20th centuries combined with models suggest that 
  tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> has increased from a global mean value of 25 DU (where 
  1 DU = 2.7<img src="images/times.gif" width="8" height="8">10<sup>16</sup> O<sub>3</sub> 
  molecules/cm<sup>2</sup>) in the pre-industrial era to 34 DU today. While the 
  SAR estimated similar values, the new analysis provides more confidence in this 
  increase of 9 DU. </p>
<p><i>Changes in atmospheric composition and chemistry over the past century have 
  affected, and those projected into the future will affect, the lifetimes of 
  many greenhouse gases and thus alter the climate forcing of anthropogenic emissions:</i></p>
<p>The atmospheric lifetime relates emissions of a component to its atmospheric 
  burden. In some cases, for instance for methane, a change in emissions perturbs 
  the chemistry and thus the corresponding lifetime. The CH<sub>4</sub> feedback 
  effect amplifies the climate forcing of an addition of CH<sub>4</sub> to the 
  current atmosphere by lengthening the perturbation lifetime relative to the 
  global atmospheric lifetime of CH<sub>4</sub> by a factor of 1.4. This earlier 
  finding is corroborated here by new model studies that also predict only small 
  changes in this CH<sub>4</sub> feedback for the different scenarios projected 
  to year 2100. Another feedback has been identified for the addition of N<sub>2</sub>O 
  to the atmosphere; it is associated with stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> chemistry 
  and shortens the perturbation lifetime relative to the global atmospheric lifetime 
  of N<sub>2</sub>O by about 5%. </p>
<p>Several chemically reactive gases - CO, NO<sub>x</sub> (=NO+NO<sub>2</sub>), 
  and VOC - control in part the abundance of O<sub>3</sub> and the oxidising capacity 
  (OH) of the troposphere. These pollutants act as indirect greenhouse gases through 
  their influence on atmospheric chemistry, e.g., formation of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  or changing the lifetime of CH<sub>4</sub>. The emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> 
  and CO are dominated by human activities. The abundance of CO in the Northern 
  Hemisphere is about twice that in the Southern Hemisphere and has increased 
  in the second half of the 20th century along with industrialisation and population. 
  The urban and regional abundance of NO<sub>x</sub> has generally increased with 
  industrialisation, but the global abundance of this short-lived, highly variable 
  pollutant cannot be derived from measurements. Increased NO<sub>x</sub> abundances 
  will in general increase tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> and decrease CH<sub>4</sub>. 
  Deposition of NO<sub>x</sub> reaction products fertilises the biosphere, stimulates 
  CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, but also provides an input of acidic precipitation. </p>
<p><i>The IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) generated six marker/illustrative 
  scenarios (labelled A1B, A1T, A1FI, A2, B1, B2) plus four preliminary marker 
  scenarios (labelled here A1p, A2p, B1p, and B2p). These projected changes in 
  anthropogenic emissions of trace gases from year 2000 to year 2100, making different 
  assumptions on population development, energy use, and technology. Results from 
  both sets of scenarios are discussed here since the preliminary marker scenarios 
  (December 1998) were used in this report:</i></p>
<p>Model calculations of the abundances of the primary greenhouse gases by year 
  2100 vary considerably across the SRES scenarios: in general A1B, A1T, and B1 
  have the smallest increases of emissions and burdens; and A1FI and A2 the largest. 
  CH<sub>4</sub> changes from 1998 to 2100 range from -10 to +115%; and N<sub>2</sub>O 
  increases from 13 to 47%. The HFCs - 134a, 143a, and 125 - reach abundances 
  of a few hundred to nearly a thousand ppt from negligible levels today. The 
  PFC CF<sub>4</sub> is projected to increase to between 200 and 400 ppt; and 
  SF<sub>6</sub> to between 35 and 65 ppt.</p>
<p>SRES projected anthropogenic emissions of the indirect greenhouse gases (NO<sub>x</sub>, 
  CO and VOC) together with changes in CH<sub>4</sub> are expected to change the 
  global mean abundance of tropo-spheric OH by -20 to +6% over the next century. 
  Comparable, but opposite sign, changes occur in the atmospheric lifetimes of 
  the greenhouse gases, CH<sub>4</sub> and HFCs. This impact depends in large 
  part on the magnitude of, and the balance between, NO<sub>x</sub> and CO emissions.</p>
<p>For the SRES scenarios, changes in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> between years 
  2000 and 2100 range from -4 to +21 DU. The largest increase predicted for the 
  21st century (scenarios A1FI and A2) would be more than twice as large as that 
  experienced since the pre-industrial era. These O<sub>3</sub> increases are 
  attributable to the concurrent, large (almost factor of 3) increases in anthropogenic 
  NO<sub>x</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. </p>
<p><i>The large growth in emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants as 
  projected in some SRES scenarios for the 21st century will degrade the global 
  environment in ways beyond climate change:</i></p>
<p>Changes projected in the SRES A2 and A1FI scenarios would degrade air quality 
  over much of the globe by increasing background levels of O<sub>3</sub>. In 
  northern mid-latitudes during summer, the zonal average increases near the surface 
  are about 30 ppb or more, raising background levels to nearly 80 ppb, threatening 
  attainment of air quality standards over most metropolitan and even rural regions, 
  and compromising crop and forest productivity. This problem reaches across continental 
  boundaries since emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> influence photochemistry on a hemispheric 
  scale.</p>
<p><i>A more complete and accurate assessment of the human impact on greenhouse 
  gases requires greater understanding of sources, processes, and coupling between 
  different parts of the climate system: </i></p>
<p>The current assessment is notably incomplete in calculating the total impact 
  of individual industrial / agricultural sectors on greenhouse gases and aerosols. 
  The IPCC Special Report on Aviation demonstrates that the total impact of a 
  sector is not represented by (nor scalable to) the direct emissions of primary 
  greenhouse gases alone, but needs to consider a wide range of atmospheric changes. 
</p>
<p>The ability to hindcast the detailed changes in atmospheric composition over 
  the past decade, particularly the variability of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  and CO, is limited by the availability of measurements and their integration 
  with models and emissions data. Nevertheless, since the SAR there have been 
  substantial advances in measurement techniques, field campaigns, laboratory 
  studies, global networks, satellite observations, and coupled models that have 
  improved the level of scientific understanding of this assessment. Better simulation 
  of the past two decades, and in due course the upcoming one, would reduce uncertainty 
  ranges and improve the confidence level of our projections of greenhouse gases. 
</p>
<p>Feedbacks between atmospheric chemistry, climate, and the biosphere were not 
  developed to the stage that they could be included in the projected numbers 
  here. Failure to include such coupling is likely to lead to systematic errors 
  and may substantially alter the projected increases in the major greenhouse 
  gases.</p>
