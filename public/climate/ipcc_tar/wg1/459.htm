<h4>12.4.2.2 Vertical patterns </h4>
<p>As noted in <a href="454.htm#1232">Section 12.3.2</a>, increases in greenhouse 
  gases produce a distinctive change in the vertical profile of temperature. Santer 
  et al. (1996c) assessed the significance of the observed changes in recent decades 
  using equilibrium GCM simulations with changes in greenhouse gases, sulphate 
  aerosols and strato-spheric ozone. This study has been extended to include results 
  from the transient AOGCM simulations, additional sensitivity studies and estimates 
  of internal variability from three different models (Santer et al., 1996a). 
  Results from this study are consistent with the earlier results - the 25-year 
  trend from 1963 to 1988 in the centred correlation statistic between the observed 
  and simulated patterns for the full atmosphere was significantly different from 
  the population of 25-year trends in the control simulations. The results were 
  robust even if the estimates of noise levels were almost doubled, or the aerosol 
  response (assumed linear and additive) was halved. The aerosol forcing leads 
  to a smaller warming in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. 
</p>
<p>Tett et al. (1996) refined Santer et al.'s (1996a) study by using ensembles 
  of transient simulations which included increases in CO<sub>2</sub>, and sulphate 
  aerosols, and reductions in stratospheric ozone, as well as using an extended 
  record of observations (see <a href="452.htm#fig128">Figure 12.8</a>). They 
  found that the best and most significant agreement with observations was found 
  when all three factors were included<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn12.htm#1","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a>. 
  Allen and Tett (1999) find that the effect of greenhouse gases can be detected 
  with these signal patterns using optimal detection (see <a href="468.htm">Appendix 
  12.1</a>).</p>
<p>Folland et al. (1998) and Sexton et al. (2001) take a complementary approach 
  using an atmospheric model forced with sea surface temperatures (SST) and ice 
  extents prescribed from observations. The correlation between the observed and 
  simulated temperature changes in the vertical relative to the base period from 
  1961 to 1975 was computed. The experiments with anthropogenic forcing (including 
  some with tropospheric ozone changes), give significantly higher correlations 
  than when only SST changes are included. </p>
<p><i>Interpretation of results</i><br>
  Weber (1996) and Michaels and Knappenburger (1996) both criticised the Santer 
  et al. (1996a) results, quoting upper air measurements analysed by Angell (1994). 
  Weber argued that the increasing pattern similarity over the full atmosphere 
  (850 to 50 hPa) resulted mainly from a Southern Hemisphere cooling associated 
  with stratospheric ozone depletion. Santer et al. (1996b) pointed out that when 
  known biases in the radiosonde data are removed (e.g., Parker et al., 1997), 
  or satellite or operationally analysed data are used, the greater stratospheric 
  cooling in the Southern Hemisphere all but disappears. Weber (1996) is correct 
  that stratospheric cooling due to ozone will contribute to the pattern similarity 
  over the full atmosphere, but decreases in stratospheric ozone alone would be 
  expected to produce a tropospheric cooling, not a warming as observed. This 
  point should be born in mind when considering a later criticism of the pattern 
  correlation approach. Both Weber (1996) and Michaels and Knappenburger (1996) 
  note that the greater warming of the Southern Hemisphere relative to the Northern 
  Hemisphere from 1963 to 1988 has since reversed. They attribute the Southern 
  Hemisphere warming from 1963 to the recovery from the cooling following the 
  eruption of Mount Agung. Santer et al. (1996b) claim that this change in asymmetry 
  is to be expected, because the heating due to increases in greenhouse gases 
  over the most recent years has probably been growing faster than the estimated 
  cooling due to increases in aerosols (see <a href="451.htm">Section 12.2.3.3</a>). 
  Calculations of the difference in the rate of warming between the Northern and 
  Southern Hemispheres vary between different climate models and as a function 
  of time, depending on the relative forcing due to greenhouse gases and sulphate 
  aerosols, and on the simulated rate of oceanic heat uptake in the Southern Hemisphere 
  (Santer et al., 1996b; Karoly and Braganza, 2001). </p>
<p><i>Assessing statistical significance of changes in the vertical patterns of 
  temperature</i><br>
  There are some difficulties in assessing the statistical significance in detection 
  studies based on changes in the vertical temperature profile. First, the observational 
  record is short, and subject to error, particularly at upper levels (<a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>). Second, the model estimates of variability may not be realistic (<a href="445.htm#1222">Section 
  12.2.2</a>), particularly in the stratosphere. Third, because of data and model 
  limitations, the number of levels used to represent the stratosphere in detection 
  studies to date is small, and hence may not be adequate to allow an accurate 
  representation of the stratospheric response. Fourth, all models produce a maximum 
  warming in the upper tropical troposphere that is not apparent in the observations 
  and whose impact on detection results is difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, 
  all the studies indicate that anthropogenic factors account for a significant 
  part of recent observed changes, whereas internal and naturally forced variations 
  alone, at least as simulated by current models, cannot explain the observed 
  changes. In addition, there are physical arguments for attributing the changes 
  in the vertical profile of temperature to anthropogenic influence (<a href="454.htm#1232">Section 
  12.3.2</a>).</p>
