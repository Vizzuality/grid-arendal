<a name="fig49"></a>Atmospheric measurements provide another cornerstone for the 
numerical modelling of photochemistry. Over the last five years direct atmospheric 
measurements of HO<sub>x</sub> radicals, made simultaneously with the other key 
species that control HO<sub>x</sub>, have been conducted over a wide range of 
conditions: the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (e.g., SPADE, ASHOE/MAESA, 
STRAT; SUCCESS, SONEX, PEM-TROPICS A &amp; B), the remote Pacific (MLOPEX), and 
the polluted boundary layer and its outflow (POPCORN, NARE, SOS). These intensive 
measurement campaigns provide the first thorough tests of tropospheric OH chemistry 
and production of O<sub>3</sub> for a range of global conditions. As an example 
here, we present an analysis of the 1997 SONEX (Subsonic assessment program Ozone 
and Nitrogen oxide EXperiment) aircraft campaign over the North Atlantic that 
tests one of the chemical models from the OxComp workshop (HGIS).
<p>The 1997 SONEX aircraft campaign over the North Atlantic provided the first 
  airborne measurements of HO<sub>x</sub> abundances concurrent with the controlling 
  chemical background: H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>OOH, CH<sub>2</sub>O, 
  O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, acetone and hydrocarbons. These 
  observations allowed a detailed evaluation of our understanding of HO<sub>x</sub> 
  chemistry and O<sub>3</sub> production in the upper troposphere. <a href="#fig49">Figure 
  4.9</a> (panels 1-3) shows a comparison between SONEX measurements and model 
  calculations (Jaegl&eacute; et al., 1999) for OH and HO<sub>2</sub> abundances 
  and the ratio HO<sub>2</sub>/OH. At each point the model used the local, simultaneously 
  observed chemical abundances. The cycling between OH and HO<sub>2</sub> takes 
  place on a time-scale of a few seconds and is mainly controlled by reaction 
  of OH with CO producing HO<sub>2</sub>, followed by reaction of HO<sub>2</sub> 
  with NO producing OH. This cycle also leads to the production of ozone. As seen 
  in <a href="#fig49">Figure 4.9</a>, the HO<sub>2</sub>/OH ratio is reproduced 
  by model calculations to within the combined uncertainties of observations (&plusmn;20%) 
  and those from propagation of rate coefficient errors in the model (&plusmn;100%), 
  implying that the photochemical processes driving the cycling between OH and 
  HO<sub>2</sub> appear to be understood (Wennberg et al., 1998; Brune et al., 
  1999). The absolute abundances of OH and HO<sub>2</sub> are matched by model 
  calculations to within 40% (the reported accuracy of the HO<sub>x</sub> observations) 
  and the median model-to-observed ratio for HO<sub>2</sub> is 1.12. The model 
  captures 80% of the observed variance in HO<sub>x</sub>, which is driven by 
  the local variations in NO<sub>x</sub> and the HO<sub>x</sub> sources (Faloona 
  et al., 2000, Jaegl&eacute; et al., 2000;). The predominant sources of HO<sub>x</sub> 
  during SONEX were reaction of O(<sup>1</sup>D) with H<sub>2</sub>O and photodissociation 
  of acetone; the role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>OOH as 
  HO<sub>x</sub> sources was small. This was not necessarily the case in some 
  of the other airborne campaigns, where large differences between measured and 
  modelled OH, up to a factor of 5, were observed in the upper troposphere. In 
  these campaigns the larger measured OH concentrations were tentatively ascribed 
  to enhanced levels of OH precursors, such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>OOH, 
  or CH<sub>2</sub>O, whose concentrations had not been measured.</p>
<p>Tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> production is tightly linked to the abundance of 
  NO<sub>x</sub>, and <a href="#fig49">Figure 4.9</a> (panel 6) shows this production 
  rate (calculated as the rate of the reaction of HO<sub>2</sub> with NO) for 
  each set of observations as function of NO<sub>x</sub> during the SONEX mission. 
  Also shown in <a href="#fig49">Figure 4.9</a> (panels 4-5) are the measured 
  abundances of OH and HO<sub>2</sub> as a function of NO<sub>x</sub>. The smooth 
  curve on each panel 4-6 is a model simulation of the expected relationship if 
  the chemical background except for NO<sub>x</sub> remained unchanged at the 
  observed median abundances. This curve shows the "expected" behaviour 
  of tropospheric chemistry when only NO<sub>x</sub> is increased: OH increases 
  with NO<sub>x</sub> abundances up to 300 ppt because HO<sub>2</sub> is shifted 
  into OH; it decreases with increasing NO<sub>x</sub> at higher NO<sub>x</sub> 
  abundances because the OH reaction with NO<sub>2</sub> forming HNO<sub>3</sub> 
  becomes the dominant sink for HO<sub>x</sub> radicals. Production of O<sub>3</sub> 
  is expected to follow a similar pattern with rates suppressed at NO<sub>x</sub> 
  abundances greater than 300 ppt under these atmospheric conditions (e.g., Ehhalt, 
  1998). These SONEX observations indicate, however, that both OH abundance and 
  O<sub>3</sub> production may continue to increase with NO<sub>x</sub> concentrations 
  up to 1,000 ppt because the high NO<sub>x</sub> abundances were often associated 
  with convection and lightning events and occurred simultaneously with high HO<sub>x</sub> 
  sources. By segregating observations according to HO<sub>x</sub> source strengths, 
  Jaegl&eacute; et al. (1999) identified the approach to NO<sub>x</sub>-saturated 
  conditions predicted by the chemical models when HO<sub>x</sub> sources remain 
  constant. A NO<sub>x</sub>-saturated environment was clearly found for the POPCORN 
  (Photo-Oxidant formation by Plant emitted Compounds and OH Radicals in north-eastern 
  Germany) boundary layer measurements in Germany (Rohrer et al., 1998; Ehhalt 
  and Rohrer, 2000). The impact of NO<sub>x</sub>-saturated conditions on the 
  production of O<sub>3</sub> is large in the boundary layer, where much of the 
  NO<sub>x</sub> is removed within a day, but may be less important in the upper 
  troposphere, where the local lifetime of NO<sub>x</sub> is several days and 
  the elevated abundances of NO<sub>x</sub> are likely to be transported and diluted 
  to below saturation levels. This effective reduction of the NO<sub>x</sub>-saturation 
  effect due to 3-D atmospheric mixing is seen in the CTM modelling of aviation 
  NO<sub>x</sub> emissions where a linear increase in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  is found, even with large NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in the upper troposphere 
  (Isaksen and Jackman, 1999). <br>
