<h2>10.5 Regional Climate Models </h2>
<p>Since the SAR, much insight has been provided into fundamental issues concerning 
  the nested regional modelling technique.</p>
<p>Multi-year to multi-decadal simulations must be used for climate change studies 
  to provide meaningful climate statistics, to identify significant systematic 
  model errors and climate changes relative to internal model and observed climate 
  variability, and to allow the atmospheric model to equilibrate with the land 
  surface conditions (e.g., Jones et al., 1997; Machenhauer et al., 1998; Christensen 
  1999; McGregor et al., 1999; Kato et al., 2001).</p>
<p>The choice of an appropriate domain is not trivial. The influence of the boundary 
  forcing can reduce as region size increases (Jones et al., 1995; Jacob and Podzun, 
  1997) and may be dominated by the internal model physics for certain variables 
  and seasons (Noguer et al., 1998). This can lead to the RCM solution significantly 
  departing from the driving data, which can make the interpretation of down-scaled 
  regional climate changes more difficult (Jones et al., 1997). The domain size 
  has to be large enough so that relevant local forcings and effects of enhanced 
  resolution are not damped or contaminated by the application of the boundary 
  conditions (Warner et al., 1997). The exact location of the lateral boundaries 
  can influence the sensitivity to internal parameters (Seth and Giorgi, 1998) 
  or may have no significant impact (Bhaskaran et al., 1996). Finally, location 
  of boundaries over areas with significant topography may lead to inconsistencies 
  and noise generation (e.g., Hong and Juang, 1998).</p>
<p>Surface forcing due to land, ocean and sea ice greatly affects regional climate 
  simulation (e.g., Giorgi et al., 1996; Seth and Giorgi, 1998; Wei and Fu, 1998; 
  Christensen, 1999; Pan et al., 1999; Pielke et al., 1999; Rinke and Dethloff, 
  1999; Chase et al., 2000; Maslanik et al., 2000, Rummukainen et al., 2000). 
  In particular, RCM experiments do not start with equilibrium conditions and 
  therefore the initialisation of surface variables, such as soil moisture and 
  temperature, is important. For example, to reach equilibrium it can require 
  a few seasons for the rooting zone (about 1 m depth) and years for the deep 
  soils (Christensen, 1999).</p>
<p>The choice of RCM resolution can modulate the effects of physical forcings 
  and parametrizations (Giorgi and Marinucci, 1996a; Laprise et al., 1998). The 
  description of the hydrologic cycle generally improves with increasing resolution 
  due to the better topographical representation (Christensen et al., 1998; Leung 
  and Ghan, 1998). Resolving more of the spectrum of atmospheric motions at high 
  resolution improves the representation of cyclonic systems and vertical velocities, 
  but can sometimes worsen aspects of the model climatology (Machenhauer et al., 
  1998; Kato et al., 1999). Different resolutions may be required to capture relevant 
  forcings in different sub-regions, which can be achieved via multiple one-way 
  nesting (Christensen et al., 1998; McGregor et al., 1999), two-way nesting (Liston 
  et al., 1999) or smoothly varying horizontal grids (Qian and Giorgi, 1999). 
  Only limited studies of the effects of changing vertical resolution have been 
  published (Kato et al., 1999).</p>
<p>RCM model physics configurations are derived either from a pre-existing (and 
  well tested) limited area model system with modifications suitable for climate 
  application (Pielke et al., 1992; Giorgi et al., 1993b,c; Leung and Ghan, 1995, 
  1998; Copeland et al., 1996; Miller and Kim, 1997; Liston and Pielke 2000; Rummukainen 
  et al., 2000) or are implemented directly from a GCM (McGregor and Walsh, 1993; 
  Jones et al., 1995; Christensen et al., 1996; Laprise et al., 1998). In the 
  first approach, each set of parametrizations is developed and optimised for 
  the respective model resolutions. However, this makes interpreting differences 
  between nested model and driving GCM more difficult, as these will not result 
  only from changes in resolution. Also, the different model physics schemes may 
  result in inconsistencies near the boundaries (Machenhauer et al., 1998; Rummukainen 
  et al., 2000). The second approach maximises compatibility between the models. 
  However, physics schemes developed for coarse resolution GCMs may not be adequate 
  for the high resolutions used in nested regional models and may, at least, require 
  recalibration (Giorgi and Marinucci, 1996a; Laprise et al., 1998; see also <a href="387.htm">Section 
  10.4</a>). Overall, both strategies have shown performance of similar quality 
  (e.g., IPCC, 1996), and either one may be preferable (Giorgi and Mearns, 1999). 
  In the context of climate change simulations, if there is no resolution dependence, 
  the second approach may be preferable to maximise consistency between RCM and 
  GCM responses to the radiative forcing.</p>
<p>Ocean RCMs have been developed during the last decades for a broad variety 
  of applications. To date, the specific use of these models, in a context similar 
  to the use of nested atmospheric RCMs for climate change studies, is very limited 
  (Kauker, 1998). Although the performance of ocean RCMs has yet to be assessed, 
  it is known that a very high resolution, few tens of kilometres or less, is 
  needed for accurate ocean simulations.</p>
<p>The construction of coupled RCMs is a very recent development. They comprise 
  atmospheric RCMs coupled to other models of climate system components, such 
  as lake, ocean/sea ice, chemistry/aerosol, and land biosphere/hydrology models 
  (Hostetler et al., 1994; Lynch et al., 1995, 1997a,b, 1998; Leung et al., 1996; 
  Bailey et al., 1997; Kim et al., 1998; Qian and Giorgi 1999; Small et al., 1999a,b; 
  Bailey and Lynch, 2000a,b; Mabuchi et al., 2000; Maslanik et al., 2000; Rummukainen 
  et al., 2000; Tsvetsinskaya et al., 2000; Weisse et al., 2000). This promises 
  the development of coupled "regional climate system models".</p>
