<h3>7.2.5 Stratospheric Dynamics</h3>
<p>Waves generated in the troposphere propagate into the stratosphere and are 
  absorbed, so that stratospheric changes alter where and how they are absorbed, 
  and effects can extend downward into the troposphere through a mechanism called 
  "downward control" (Haynes et al., 1991). The downward propagation 
  of zonal-mean anomalies provides a purely dynamical stratosphere-troposphere 
  link, which may account for the well-documented troposphere-stratosphere anomaly 
  correlations seen in observations (Baldwin et al., 1994; Perlwitz and Graf, 
  1995). The North Atlantic Oscillation (<a href="302.htm">Section 7.6.4</a>) 
  thus could be coupled with the strength of the wintertime Arctic vortex (Thompson 
  and Wallace, 1998).</p>
<p> The dominant wave-induced forcing in the stratosphere is believed to come 
  from tropospherically generated planetary scale Rossby waves in wintertime. 
  These waves are explicitly resolved in models and data. Thus the meridional 
  mass circulation, although two-celled, is predominantly directed towards the 
  winter pole (e.g., Eluszkiewicz et al., 1996), and leads to a significant warming 
  and weakening of the polar night vortex relative to its radiatively determined 
  state (Andrews et al., 1987). Variability and changes in planetary wave forcing 
  thus lead directly to variability and changes in wintertime polar temperatures, 
  which modulate chemical ozone loss (WMO, 1999).</p>
<p> The principal uncertainties in wave-induced forcing come from gravity waves, 
  which are undetected in analyses, but whose role is inferred from systematic 
  errors in climate models. The most notable such error is the tendency of all 
  atmospheric GCMs to suffer from excessively cold polar temperatures in the winter 
  stratosphere, together with an excessively strong polar night jet, especially 
  in the Southern Hemisphere (Boville, 1995). Enhanced Rayleigh friction improves 
  the results (Manzini and Bengtsson, 1996; Butchart and Austin, 1998), but its 
  physical basis is unclear (Shepherd et al., 1996). The principal forcing of 
  gravity waves arises from unresolved sub-grid scale processes, such as convection, 
  and more physically based gravity wave parametrizations are being developed.</p>
<p> A dominant factor determining the interannual variability of the stratosphere 
  is the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). It is driven by wave drag (momentum 
  transport), but it remains unclear exactly which waves are involved (Dunkerton, 
  1997). Most current atmospheric GCMs do not simulate the QBO and are therefore 
  incomplete in terms of observed phenomena. It appears that QBO-type oscillations 
  are found in models with higher vertical resolution (better than 1 km, Takahashi, 
  1996; Horinouchi and Yoden, 1998). It is still not clear what aspects of vertical 
  resolution, energy dissipation, and wave spectrum are necessary to generate 
  the QBO in climate models in a self-consistent way.</p>
<p> The meridional mass circulation, known as the Brewer-Dobson circulation, transports 
  chemical species poleward in the stratosphere (Andrews et al., 1987). Air entering 
  the stratosphere in the tropics returns to the troposphere in the extratropics 
  with a time-scale of about five years (Rosenlof, 1995). Current models indicate 
  shorter time-scales (Waugh et al., 1997), but the reasons are not currently 
  well understood. The variation of the height of the troposphere with latitude 
  is also important for meridional transport and troposphere-stratosphere exchange. 
  This is because mid-latitude cross-tropopause mixing is preferentially along 
  isentropic surfaces which are in the troposphere in the tropics but in the stratosphere 
  at higher latitudes. Transport processes in the lowermost stratosphere are important 
  factors affecting tropospheric climate (Pan et al., 1997).</p>
<p> The mean climate and variability of the stratosphere are not well simulated 
  in current models. Because there is increasing evidence of effects of the stratosphere 
  on the troposphere, this increases uncertainty in model results for tropospheric 
  climate change. A key concern is how well mixing on small scales is done in 
  the lowermost stratosphere. While overdue attention is being given to the stratosphere 
  as more resolution in the vertical is added to models, further increases in 
  resolution are desirable.</p>
