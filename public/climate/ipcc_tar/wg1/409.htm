<h2>Executive Summary </h2>
<p>This chapter assesses the current state of knowledge of the rate of change 
  of global average and regional sea level in relation to climate change. We focus 
  on the 20th and 21st centuries. However, because of the slow response to past 
  conditions of the oceans and ice sheets and the consequent land movements, we 
  consider changes in sea level prior to the historical record, and we also look 
  over a thousand years into the future.</p>
<p>Past changes in sea level<br>
  From recent analyses, our conclusions are as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Since the Last Glacial Maximum about 20,000 years ago, sea level has risen 
    by over 120 m at locations far from present and former ice sheets, as a result 
    of loss of mass from these ice sheets. There was a rapid rise between 15,000 
    and 6,000 years ago at an average rate of 10 mm/yr.</li>
  <li>Based on geological data, global average sea level may have risen at an 
    average rate of about 0.5 mm/yr over the last 6,000 years and at an average 
    rate of 0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr over the last 3,000 years.</li>
  <li>Vertical land movements are still occurring today as a result of these large 
    transfers of mass from the ice sheets to the ocean. </li>
  <li>During the last 6,000 years, global average sea level variations on time-scales 
    of a few hundred years and longer are likely to have been less than 0.3 to 
    0.5 m. </li>
  <li>Based on tide gauge data, the rate of global average sea level rise during 
    the 20th century is in the range 1.0 to 2.0 mm/yr, with a central value of 
    1.5 mm/yr (as with other ranges of uncertainty, it is not implied that the 
    central value is the best estimate). </li>
  <li>Based on the few very long tide gauge records, the average rate of sea level 
    rise has been larger during the 20th century than the 19th century. </li>
  <li>No significant acceleration in the rate of sea level rise during the 20th 
    century has been detected. </li>
  <li>There is decadal variability in extreme sea levels but no evidence of widespread 
    increases in extremes other than that associated with a change in the mean.</li>
</ul>
<p>Factors affecting present day sea level change<br>
  Global average sea level is affected by many factors. Our assessment of the 
  most important is as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ocean thermal expansion leads to an increase in ocean volume at constant 
    mass. Observational estimates of about 1 mm/yr over recent decades are similar 
    to values of 0.7 to 1.1 mm/yr obtained from Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation 
    Models (AOGCMs) over a comparable period. Averaged over the 20th century, 
    AOGCM simulations result in rates of thermal expansion of 0.3 to 0.7 mm/yr. 
  </li>
  <li>The mass of the ocean, and thus sea level, changes as water is exchanged 
    with glaciers and ice caps. Observational and modelling studies of glaciers 
    and ice caps indicate a contribution to sea level rise of 0.2 to 0.4 mm/yr 
    averaged over the 20th century. </li>
  <li>Climate changes during the 20th century are estimated from modelling studies 
    to have led to contributions of between -0.2 and 0.0 mm/yr from Antarctica 
    (the results of increasing precipitation) and 0.0 to 0.1 mm/yr from Greenland 
    (from changes in both precipitation and runoff). </li>
  <li>Greenland and Antarctica have contributed 0.0 to 0.5 mm/yr over the 20th 
    century as a result of long-term adjustment to past climate changes. </li>
  <li>Changes in terrestrial storage of water over the period 1910 to 1990 are 
    estimated to have contributed from -1.1 to +0.4 mm/yr of sea level rise. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The sum of these components indicates a rate of eustatic sea level rise (corresponding 
  to a change in ocean volume) from 1910 to 1990 ranging from -0.8 to 2.2 
  mm/yr, with a central value of 0.7 mm/yr. The upper bound is close to the observational 
  upper bound (2.0 mm/yr), but the central value is less than the observational 
  lower bound (1.0 mm/yr), i.e., the sum of components is biased low compared 
  to the observational estimates. The sum of components indicates an acceleration 
  of only 0.2 mm/yr/century, with a range from -1.1 to +0.7 mm/yr/century, 
  consistent with observational finding of no acceleration in sea level rise during 
  the 20th century. The estimated rate of sea level rise from anthropogenic climate 
  change from 1910 to 1990 (from modelling studies of thermal expansion, glaciers 
  and ice sheets) ranges from 0.3 to 0.8 mm/yr. It is very likely that 20th century 
  warming has contributed significantly to the observed sea level rise, through 
  thermal expansion of sea water and widespread loss of land ice. </p>
<p>Projected sea level changes from 1990 to 2100<br>
  Projections of components contributing to sea level change from 1990 to 2100 
  (this period is chosen for consistency with the IPCC Second Assessment Report), 
  using a range of AOGCMs following the IS92a scenario (including the direct effect 
  of sulphate aerosol emissions) give: </p>
<ul>
  <li> thermal expansion of 0.11 to 0.43 m, accelerating through the 21st century; 
  </li>
  <li> a glacier contribution of 0.01 to 0.23 m; </li>
  <li>a Greenland contribution of -0.02 to 0.09 m;</li>
  <li>an Antarctic contribution of -0.17 to 0.02 m. </li>
</ul>
<p>Including thawing of permafrost, deposition of sediment, and the ongoing contributions 
  from ice sheets as a result of climate change since the Last Glacial Maximum, 
  we obtain a range of global-average sea level rise from 0.11 to 0.77 m. This 
  range reflects systematic uncertainties in modelling.</p>
<p>For the 35 SRES scenarios, we project a sea level rise of 0.09 to 0.88 m for 
  1990 to 2100, with a central value of 0.48 m. The central value gives an average 
  rate of 2.2 to 4.4 times the rate over the 20th century. If terrestrial storage 
  continued at its present rates, the projections could be changed by -0.21 
  to +0.11 m. For an average AOGCM, the SRES scenarios give results which differ 
  by 0.02 m or less for the first half of the 21st century. By 2100, they vary 
  over a range amounting to about 50% of the central value. Beyond the 21st century, 
  sea level rise will depend strongly on the emissions scenario.</p>
<p>The West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) has attracted special attention because 
  it contains enough ice to raise sea level by 6 m and because of suggestions 
  that instabilities associated with its being grounded below sea level may result 
  in rapid ice discharge when the surrounding ice shelves are weakened. The range 
  of projections given above makes no allowance for ice-dynamic instability of 
  the WAIS. It is now widely agreed that major loss of grounded ice and accelerated 
  sea level rise are very unlikely during the 21st century.</p>
<p>Our confidence in the regional distribution of sea level change from AOGCMs 
  is low because there is little similarity between models. However, models agree 
  on the qualitative conclusion that the range of regional variation is substantial 
  compared with the global average sea level rise. Nearly all models project greater 
  than average rise in the Arctic Ocean and less than average rise in the Southern 
  Ocean.</p>
<p>Land movements, both isostatic and tectonic, will continue through the 21st 
  century at rates which are unaffected by climate change. It can be expected 
  that by 2100 many regions currently experiencing relative sea level fall will 
  instead have a rising relative sea level. </p>
<p>Extreme high water levels will occur with increasing frequency (i.e. with reducing 
  return period) as a result of mean sea level rise. Their frequency may be further 
  increased if storms become more frequent or severe as a result of climate change.<br>
  Longer term changes</p>
<p>If greenhouse gas concentrations were stabilised, sea level would nonetheless 
  continue to rise for hundreds of years. After 500 years, sea level rise from 
  thermal expansion may have reached only half of its eventual level, which models 
  suggest may lie within ranges of 0.5 to 2.0 m and 1 to 4 m for CO<sub>2</sub> levels of 
  twice and four times pre-industrial, respectively. </p>
<p>Glacier retreat will continue and the loss of a substantial fraction of the 
  total glacier mass is likely. Areas that are currently marginally glaciated 
  are most likely to become ice-free.</p>
<p>Ice sheets will continue to react to climate change during the next several 
  thousand years even if the climate is stabilised. Models project that a local 
  annual-average warming of larger than 3&deg;C sustained for millennia would 
  lead to virtually a complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet. For a warming 
  over Greenland of 5.5&deg;C, consistent with mid-range stabilisation scenarios, 
  the Greenland ice sheet contributes about 3 m in 1,000 years. For a warming 
  of 8&deg;C, the contribution is about 6 m, the ice sheet being largely eliminated. 
  For smaller warmings, the decay of the ice sheet would be substantially slower.</p>
<p>Current ice dynamic models project that the WAIS will contribute no more than 
  3 mm/yr to sea level rise over the next thousand years, even if significant 
  changes were to occur in the ice shelves. However, we note that its dynamics 
  are still inadequately understood to make firm projections, especially on the 
  longer time-scales. </p>
<p>Apart from the possibility of an internal ice dynamic instability, surface 
  melting will affect the long-term viability of the Antarctic ice sheet. For 
  warmings of more than 10&deg;C, simple runoff models predict that a zone of 
  net mass loss would develop on the ice sheet surface. Irreversible disintegration 
  of the WAIS would result because the WAIS cannot retreat to higher ground once 
  its margins are subjected to surface melting and begin to recede. Such a disintegration 
  would take at least a few millennia. Thresholds for total disintegration of 
  the East Antarctic Ice Sheet by surface melting involve warmings above 20&deg;C, 
  a situation that has not occurred for at least 15 million years and which is 
  far more than predicted by any scenario of climate change currently under consideration.</p>
