<p>The atmospheric lifetime of dust depends on particle size; large particles 
  are quickly removed from the atmosphere by gravitational settling, while sub-micron 
  sized particles can have atmospheric lifetimes of several weeks. A number of 
  models of dust mobilisation and transport have been developed for regional to 
  global scales (Marticorena et al., 1997; Miller and Tegen, 1998; Tegen and Miller, 
  1998).</p>
<p> To estimate the radiative effects of dust aerosol, information is required 
  about particle size, refractive index, and whether the minerals are mixed externally 
  or as aggregates (Tegen et al., 1996; Schulz et al., 1998; Sokolik and Toon, 
  1999; Jacobson, 2001). Typical volume median diameters of dust particles are 
  of the order of 2 to 4 mm. Refractive indices measured on Saharan dust have 
  often been used to estimate the global dust radiative forcing (Tegen et al., 
  1996). Since this dust has a single scattering albedo significantly below one, 
  the resulting forcing is small due to partial cancellation of solar and thermal 
  forcing, as well as cancellation of positive and negative forcing over different 
  geographic regions (Tegen and Lacis, 1996). However, different refractive indices 
  of dust from different regions as well as regional differences in surface albedo 
  lead to a large uncertainty in the resulting top-of-atmosphere dust forcing 
  (Sokolik and Toon, 1996; Claquin et al., 1998, 1999).<br>

<h4>5.2.2.2 Sea salt</h4>
<p>Sea salt aerosols are generated by various physical processes, especially the 
  bursting of entrained air bubbles during whitecap formation (Blanchard, 1983; 
  Monahan et al., 1986), resulting in a strong dependence on wind speed. This 
  aerosol may be the dominant contributor to both light scattering and cloud nuclei 
  in those regions of the marine atmosphere where wind speeds are high and/or 
  other aerosol sources are weak (O'Dowd et al., 1997; Murphy et al., 1998a; 
  Quinn et al., 1998). Sea salt particles are very efficient CCN, and therefore 
  characterisation of their surface production is of major importance for aerosol 
  indirect effects. For example, Feingold et al. (1999a) showed that in concentrations 
  of 1 particle per litre, giant salt particles are able to modify strato-cumulus 
  drizzle production and cloud albedo significantly.<br>
</p>
<p> Sea salt particles cover a wide size range (about 0.05 to 10 mm diameter), 
  and have a correspondingly wide range of atmospheric lifetimes. Thus, as for 
  dust, it is necessary to analyse their emissions and atmospheric distribution 
  in a size-resolved model. A semi-empirical formulation was used by Gong et al. 
  (1998) to relate the size-segregated surface emission rates of sea salt aerosols 
  to the wind field and produce global monthly sea salt fluxes for eight size 
  intervals between 0.06 and 16 mm dry diameter (<a href="168.htm#fig52">Figure 
  5.2g</a> and <a href="168.htm#tab53">Table 5.3</a>). For the present-day climate, 
  the total sea salt flux from ocean to atmosphere is estimated to be 3,300 Tg/yr, 
  within the range of previous estimates (1,000 to 3,000 Tg/yr, Erickson and Duce, 
  1988; 5,900 Tg/yr, Tegen et al., 1997).</p>
<h4><a name="5223"></a>5.2.2.3 Industrial dust, primary anthropogenic aerosols<br>
</h4>
<p>Transportation, coal combustion, cement manufacturing, metallurgy, and waste 
  incineration are among the industrial and technical activities that produce 
  primary aerosol particles. Recent estimates for the current emission of these 
  aerosols range from about 100 Tg/yr (Andreae, 1995) to about 200 Tg/yr (Wolf 
  and Hidy, 1997). These aerosol sources are responsible for the most conspicuous 
  impact of anthropogenic aerosols on environmental quality, and have been widely 
  monitored and regulated. As a result, the emission of industrial dust aerosols 
  has been reduced significantly, particularly in developed countries. Considering 
  the source strength and the fact that much industrial dust is present in a size 
  fraction that is not optically very active (&gt;1 mm diameter), it is probably 
  not of climatic importance at present. On the other hand, growing industrialisation 
  without stringent emission controls, especially in Asia, may lead to increases 
  in this source to values above 300 Tg/yr by 2040 (Wolf and Hidy, 1997).</p>
