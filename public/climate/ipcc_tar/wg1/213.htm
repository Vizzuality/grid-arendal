<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Radiative forcing continues to be a useful tool to estimate, to a first 
    order, the relative climate impacts (viz., relative global mean surface temperature 
    responses) due to radiatively induced perturbations. The practical appeal 
    of the radiative forcing concept is due, in the main, to the assumption that 
    there exists a general relationship between the global mean forcing and the 
    global mean equilibrium surface temperature response (i.e., the global mean 
    climate sensitivity parameter, <img src="images/lamda-s.gif" width="8" height="8">) 
    which is similar for all the different types of forcings. Model investigations 
    of responses to many of the relevant forcings indicate an approximate near 
    invariance of l (to about 25%). There is some evidence from model studies, 
    however, that <img src="images/lamda-s.gif" width="8" height="8"> can be substantially 
    different for certain forcing types. Reiterating the IPCC WGI Second Assessment 
    Report (IPCC, 1996a) (hereafter SAR), the global mean forcing estimates are 
    not necessarily indicators of the detailed aspects of the potential climate 
    responses (e.g., regional climate change). </li>
  <li>The simple formulae used by the IPCC to calculate the radiative forcing 
    due to well-mixed greenhouse gases have been improved, leading to a slight 
    change in the forcing estimates. Compared to the use of the earlier expressions, 
    the improved formulae, for fixed changes in gas concentrations, decrease the 
    carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) radiative 
    forcing by 15%, increase the CFC-11 and CFC-12 radiative forcing by 10 to 
    15%, while yielding no change in the case of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). Using 
    the new expressions, the radiative forcing due to the increases in the well-mixed 
    greenhouse gases from the pre-industrial (1750) to present time (1998) is 
    now estimated to be +2.43 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (comprising CO<sub>2</sub> (1.46 Wm<sup>-2</sup>), 
    CH<sub>4</sub> (0.48 Wm<sup>-2</sup>), N<sub>2</sub>O (0.15 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) 
    and halocarbons (halogen-containing compounds) (0.34 Wm<sup>-2</sup>)), with 
    an uncertainty<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fn6.htm","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>1</sup></small></a>  of 10% and a high 
    level of scientific understanding (LOSU). </li>
  <li>The forcing due to the loss of stratospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) between 
    1979 and 1997 is estimated to be -0.15 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (range: -0.05 to -0.25 
    Wm<sup>-2</sup>). The magnitude is slightly larger than in the SAR owing to 
    the longer period now considered. Incomplete knowledge of the O<sub>3</sub> 
    losses near the tropopause continues to be the main source of uncertainty. 
    The LOSU of this forcing is assigned a medium rank.</li>
  <li>The global average radiative forcing due to increases in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
    since pre-industrial times is estimated to be +0.35 &plusmn; 0.15 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. 
    This estimate is consistent with the SAR estimate, but is based on a much 
    wider range of model studies and a single analysis that is constrained by 
    observations; there are uncertainties because of the inter-model differences, 
    the limited information on pre-industrial O<sub>3</sub> distributions, and 
    the limited data that are available to evaluate the model trends for modern 
    (post-1960) conditions. A rank of medium is assigned for the LOSU of this 
    forcing.</li>
  <li>The changes in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> are mainly driven by increased 
    emissions of CH<sub>4</sub>, carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane hydrocarbons 
    (NMHCs) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), but the specific contributions 
    of each are not yet well quantified. Tropospheric and stratospheric photochemical 
    processes lead to other indirect radiative forcings through, for instance, 
    changes in the hydroxyl radical (OH) distribution and increase in stratospheric 
    water vapour concentrations.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Models have been used to estimate the direct radiative forcing for five 
    distinct aerosol species of anthropogenic origin. The global, annual mean 
    radiative forcing is estimated as -0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (-0.2 to -0.8 
    Wm<sup>-2</sup>) for sulphate aerosols; -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (-0.07 to 
    -0.6 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) for biomass burning aerosols; -0.10 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
    (-0.03 to -0.30 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) for fossil fuel organic carbon 
    aerosols; +0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (+0.1 to +0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) for fossil fuel 
    black carbon aerosols; and in the range -0.6 to +0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for mineral 
    dust aerosols. The LOSU for sulphate aerosols is low while for biomass burning, 
    fossil fuel organic carbon, fossil fuel black carbon, and mineral dust aerosols 
    the LOSU is very low. </li>
  <li>Models have been used to estimate the "first" indirect effect 
    of anthropogenic sulphate and carbonaceous aerosols (namely, a reduction in 
    the cloud droplet size at constant liquid water content) as applicable in 
    the context of liquid clouds, yielding global mean radiative forcings ranging 
    from -0.3 to -1.8 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. Because of the large uncertainties in aerosol 
    and cloud processes and their parametrizations in general circulation models 
    (GCMs), the potentially incomplete knowledge of the radiative effect of black 
    carbon in clouds, and the possibility that the forcings for individual aerosol 
    types may not be additive, a range of radiative forcing from 0 to -2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> 
    is adopted considering all aerosol types, with no best estimate. The LOSU 
    for this forcing is very low.</li>
  <li>The "second" indirect effect of aerosols (a decrease in the precipitation 
    efficiency, increase in cloud water content and cloud lifetime) is another 
    potentially important mechanism for climate change. It is difficult to define 
    and quantify in the context of current radiative forcing of climate change 
    evaluations and current model simulations. No estimate is therefore given. 
    Nevertheless, present GCM calculations suggest that the radiative flux perturbation 
    associated with the second aerosol indirect effect is of the same sign and 
    could be of similar magnitude compared to the first effect.</li>
  <li>Aerosol levels in the stratosphere have now fallen to well below the peak 
    values seen in 1991 to 1993 in the wake of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, and 
    are comparable to the low values seen in about 1979, a quiescent period for 
    volcanic activity. Although episodic in nature and transient in duration, 
    stratospheric aerosols from explosive volcanic eruptions can exert a significant 
    influence on the time history of radiative forcing of climate.</li>
  <li>Owing to an increase in land-surface albedo during snow cover in deforested 
    mid-latitude areas, changes in land use are estimated to yield a forcing of 
    -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (range: 0 to -0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup>). However, the LOSU 
    is very low and there have been much less intensive investigations compared 
    with other anthropogenic forcings.</li>
  <li>Radiative forcing due to changes in total solar irradiance (TSI) is estimated 
    to be +0.3 &plusmn; 0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for the period 1750 to the present. 
    The wide range given, and the very low LOSU, are largely due to uncertainties 
    in past values of TSI. Satellite observations, which now extend for two decades, 
    are of sufficient precision to show variations in TSI over the solar 11-year 
    activity cycle of about 0.08%. Variations over longer periods may have been 
    larger but the techniques used to reconstruct historical values of TSI from 
    proxy observations (e.g., sunspots) have not been adequately verified. Solar 
    radiation varies more substantially in the ultraviolet region and GCM studies 
    suggest that inclusion of spectrally resolved solar irradiance variations 
    and solar-induced stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> changes may improve the realism 
    of model simulations of the impact of solar variability on climate. Other 
    mechanisms for the amplification of solar effects on climate, such as enhancement 
    of the Earth's electric field causing electrofreezing of cloud particles, 
    may exist but do not yet have a rigorous theoretical or observational basis.</li>
  <li>Radiative forcings and Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) are presented for 
    an expanded set of gases. New categories of gases in the radiative forcing 
    set include fluorinated organic molecules, many of which are ethers that may 
    be considered as halocarbon substitutes. Some of the GWPs have larger uncertainties 
    than others, particularly for those gases where detailed laboratory data on 
    lifetimes are not yet available. The direct GWPs have been calculated relative 
    to CO<sub>2</sub> using an improved calculation of the CO<sub>2</sub> radiative 
    forcing, the SAR response function for a CO<sub>2</sub> pulse, and new estimates 
    for the radiative forcing and lifetimes for a number of gases. As a consequence 
    of changes in the radiative forcing for CO<sub>2</sub> and CFC-11, the revised 
    GWPs are typically 20% higher than listed in the SAR. Indirect GWPs are also 
    discussed for some new gases, including CO. The direct GWPs for those species 
    whose lifetimes are well characterised are estimated to be accurate (relative 
    to one another) to within &plusmn;35%, but the indirect GWPs are less certain.</li>
  <li>The geographical distributions of each of the forcing mechanisms vary considerably. 
    While well-mixed greenhouse gases exert a significant radiative forcing everywhere 
    on the globe, the forcings due to the short-lived species (e.g., direct and 
    indirect aerosol effects, tropospheric and stratospheric O<sub>3</sub>) are 
    not global in extent and can be highly spatially inhomogeneous. Furthermore, 
    different radiative forcing mechanisms lead to differences in the partitioning 
    of the perturbation between the atmosphere and surface. While the Northern 
    to Southern Hemisphere ratio of the solar and well-mixed greenhouse gas forcings 
    is very nearly 1, that for the fossil fuel generated sulphate and carbonaceous 
    aerosols and tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> is substantially greater than 1 (i.e., 
    primarily in the Northern Hemisphere), and that for stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
    and biomass burning aerosol is less than 1 (i.e., primarily in the Southern 
    Hemisphere).</li>
  <li>The global mean radiative forcing evolution comprises of a steadily increasing 
    contribution due to the well-mixed greenhouse gases. Other greenhouse gas 
    contributions are due to stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> from the late 1970s to 
    the present, and tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> whose precise evolution over the 
    past century is uncertain. The evolution of the direct aerosol forcing due 
    to sulphates parallels approximately the secular changes in the sulphur emissions, 
    but it is more difficult to estimate the temporal evolution due to the other 
    aerosol components, while estimates for the indirect forcings are even more 
    problematic. The temporal evolution estimates indicate that the net natural 
    forcing (solar plus stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions) has been 
    negative over the past two and possibly even the past four decades. In contrast, 
    the positive forcing by well-mixed greenhouse gases has increased rapidly 
    over the past four decades.</li>
  <li>Estimates of the global mean radiative forcing due to different future scenarios 
    (up to 2100) of the emissions of trace gases and aerosols have been performed 
    (Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al., 2000; see also <a href="095.htm">Chapters 
    3</a>, <a href="127.htm">4</a> and <a href="160.htm">5</a>). Although there 
    is a large variation in the estimates from the different scenarios, the results 
    indicate that the forcing (evaluated relative to pre-industrial times, 1750) 
    due to the trace gases taken together is projected to increase, with the fraction 
    of the total due to CO<sub>2</sub> becoming even greater than for the present 
    day. The direct aerosol (sulphate, black and organic carbon components taken 
    together) radiative forcing (evaluated relative to the present day, 2000) 
    varies in sign for the different scenarios. The direct aerosol effects are 
    estimated to be substantially smaller in magnitude than that of CO<sub>2</sub>. 
    No estimates are made for the spatial aspects of the future forcings. Relative 
    to 2000, the change in the direct plus indirect aerosol radiative forcing 
    is projected to be smaller in magnitude than that of CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
