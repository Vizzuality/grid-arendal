<h4>10.3.2.2 Climate variability and extreme events</h4>
<p>Gregory and Mitchell (1995) identified in an equilibrium 2xCO<sub>2</sub> simulation 
  with the Hadley Centre model a tendency for daily temperature variability over 
  Europe to increase in JJA and to decrease in DJF. Subsequent work on temperature 
  variability at daily to monthly and seasonal time-scales has tended to confirm 
  this pattern, as found by Buishand and Beersma (1996) over Europe, Beersma and 
  Buishand (1999) over southern Europe, northern Europe and central North America 
  and Boer et al. (2000b) throughout the northern mid-latitudes. This tendency 
  can also be seen in the results of Giorgi and Francisco (2000a) for a set of 
  transient HadCM2 simulations over different regions of the globe.</p>
<p>Daily high temperature extremes are likely to increase in frequency as a function 
  of the increase in mean temperature, but this increase is modified by changes 
  in daily variability of temperature. There is a corresponding decrease in the 
  frequency of daily low temperature extremes. Kharin and Zwiers (2000) and Zwiers 
  and Kharin (1997) found that in all regions of the globe the CGCM1 model simulated 
  substantial increases in the magnitude of extreme daily maximum and minimum 
  temperatures, with an average frequency of occurrence of once per twenty years. 
  Delworth et al. (1999) considered simulated changes of a &#145;heat index' 
  (a measure which combines the effect temperature and moisture) in the GFDL R15a 
  model. Their results indicated that seasonally warm and humid areas such as 
  the south-eastern United States, India, Southeast Asia and northern Australia 
  can experience increases in the heat index substantially greater than that expected 
  due to warming alone.</p>
<p>There is a strong correlation between precipitation inter-annual variability 
  and mean precipitation. Increases in mean precipitation are likely to be associated 
  with increases in variability, and precipitation variability is likely to decrease 
  in areas of reduced mean precipitation. In general, where simulated changes 
  in regional precipitation variability have been examined, increases are more 
  commonly noted. Giorgi and Francisco (2000a) found a tendency for regional interannual 
  variability of seasonal mean precipitation to increase in HadCM2 simulations 
  in many of the regions they considered. Increases in interannual variability 
  also predominated in the CGCM1 simulation (Boer et al., 2000b) although there 
  were areas of decrease, particularly in areas where mean rainfall decreased. 
  Beersma and Buishand (1999) mostly found increases in monthly precipitation 
  variance over southern Europe, northern Europe and central North America. A 
  number of studies have reported a tendency for interannual rainfall variability 
  to increase over South Asia (SAR; Lal et al., 2000). McGuffie et al. (1999) 
  identified a tendency for increased daily rainfall variability in two models 
  over the Sahel, North America, South Asia, southern Europe and Australia. It 
  should also be noted that in many regions interannual climatic variability is 
  strongly related to ENSO, and thus will be affected by changes in ENSO behaviour 
  (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<p>The tendency for increased rainfall variability in enhanced GHG simulations 
  is reflected in a tendency for increases in the intensity and frequency of extreme 
  heavy rainfall events. Such increases have been documented in regionally focused 
  studies for Europe, North America, South Asia, the Sahel, southern Africa, Australia 
  and the South Pacific (Hennessy et al., 1997; Bhaskaran and Mitchell, 1998; 
  McGuffie et al 1999; Jones, R.N. et al., 2000) as well as in the global studies 
  of Kharin and Zwiers (2000) and Zwiers and Kharin (1998). For example, Hennessy 
  et al. (1997) found that under 2xCO<sub>2</sub> conditions the one-year return period events 
  in Europe, Australia, India and the USA increased in intensity by 10 to 25% 
  in two models.</p>
<p>Changes in the occurrence of dry spells or droughts have been assessed for 
  some regions using recent model results. Joubert et al. (1996) examined drought 
  occurrence over southern Africa in an equilibrium 2xCO<sub>2</sub> CSIRO simulation and 
  noted areas of both substantial increase and decrease. Gregory et al. (1997) 
  looked at drought occurrence over Europe and North America in a transient simulation 
  using both rainfall-based and soil moisture-based measures of drought. In all 
  cases, marked increases were obtained. This was attributed primarily to a reduction 
  in the number of rainfall events rather than a reduction in mean rainfall. Marked 
  increases in the frequency and intensity of drought were found also by Kothavala 
  (1997) over Australia using the Palmer drought severity index.</p>
<p>Fewer studies have considered changes in variability and extremes of synoptic 
  circulation under enhanced GHG conditions. Huth (1997) noted little change in 
  synoptic circulation variability under equilibrium 2xCO<sub>2</sub> conditions over North 
  America and Europe. Katzfey and McInnes (1996) found that the intense cut-off 
  lows off the Australian east coast became less common under equilibrium 2xCO<sub>2</sub> 
  conditions in the CSIRO model, although they had limited confidence in this 
  result. </p>
<h3><a name="1033"></a>10.3.3 Summary and Recommendations</h3>
<p>Analysis of transient simulations with AOGCMs indicates that average climatic 
  features are generally well simulated at the planetary and continental scale. 
  At the regional scale, area-average biases in the simulation of present day 
  climate are highly variable from region to region and across models. Seasonal 
  temperature biases are typically within the range of &plusmn;4&deg;C but exceed 
  &plusmn;5&deg;C in some regions, particularly in DJF. Precipitation biases are 
  mostly between -40 and +80%, but exceed 100% in some regions. These regional 
  biases are, in general terms, smaller than those of a similar analysis presented 
  in the SAR. When it has been assessed, many aspects of model variability have 
  compared well against observations, although significant model-dependent biases 
  have been noted. Model performance was poorer at the finer scales, particularly 
  in areas of strong topographical variation. This highlights the need for finer 
  resolution regionalisation techniques.</p>
<p>Simulated changes in mean climatic conditions for the last decades of the 21st 
  century (compared to present day climate) vary substantially among models and 
  among regions. All land regions undergo warming in all seasons, with the warming 
  being generally more pronounced over cold climate regions and seasons. Average 
  precipitation increases over most regions, especially in the cold season, due 
  to an intensified hydrological cycle. However, some exceptions occur in which 
  most models concur in simulating decreases in precipitation. The magnitude of 
  regional precipitation change varies considerably among models with the typical 
  range being around 0 to 50%, where the direction of change is strongly indicated, 
  and around -30 to +30% where it is not. There is strong tendency for models 
  to simulate regional increases in precipitation variability with associated 
  increases in the frequency of extreme rainfall events. Increased interannual 
  precipitation variability is also commonly simulated and, in some regions, increases 
  in drought or dry-spell occurrence have been noted. Daily to inter-annual variability 
  of temperature is simulated to decrease in winter and increase in summer in 
  mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere land areas.</p>
