<h4>6.8.2.2 Estimates of the second indirect effect and of the combined effect</h4>
<p>Whereas the first indirect effect can be computed diagnostically, assessment 
  of the second indirect effect implies that two independent (i.e., with the same 
  fixed sea surface temperatures, but with different meteorologies) GCM simulations 
  be made, a first one with pre-industrial and a second one with present day aerosols. 
  The difference in top of the atmosphere fluxes or cloud radiative forcings between 
  two such simulations is used as a proxy for the forcings due to the second indirect 
  and the combined effects. The simulations need to be sufficiently long (usually 
  5 years) so that the effects of natural variability are expected to average 
  out. However, as a consequence, the estimates of the aerosol indirect effect 
  may include some undesirable feedbacks involving climate parameters which would 
  violate the definition adopted for radiative forcing of climate change by IPCC 
  (see also <a href="214.htm#611">Section 6.1.1</a>). Rotstayn and Penner (2001) 
  showed that, at least in their model, the difference in top of the atmosphere 
  fluxes between two simulations did not differ by more than 10% from the radiative 
  forcing for the first indirect effect computed diagnostically. Caution should 
  nevertheless be exercised before this result can be generalised to other models 
  and to the second indirect effect.</p>
<p>Jones et al. (1999) and Rotstayn (1999) provide estimates for the second indirect 
  effect alone with ranges of -0.53 to -2.29 Wm<sup>-2</sup> and -0.4 to -1.0 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. 
  For the combined effect (first and second effects estimated together), Jones 
  et al. (1999) and Rotstayn (1999) give best estimates of -1.18 and -2.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. 
  Larger radiative impacts are found in sensitivity tests by Rotstayn (1999) and 
  Lohmann and Feichter (1997), with values of -3.2 and -4.8 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. 
  Rotstayn (1999) tried an alternative parametrization for cloud droplet concentration 
  (Roelofs et al., 1998) and Lohmann and Feichter (1997) tried an alternative 
  cloud scheme. In contrast to these studies, Lohmann et al. (2000) adopted a 
  "mechanistic" approach, where they introduced a prognostic equation 
  for the cloud droplet number concentration. They predict a much smaller combined 
  effect with radiative impact of 0.0 and -0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, assuming externally and internally 
  mixed sulphate aerosols, respectively. The authors attribute this rather small 
  radiative impact to the small increase in anthropogenic sulphate aerosol number 
  concentrations. Ghan et al. (2001a) estimate a combined effect of -1.7 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup> using a mechanistic approach similar to that of Lohmann et al., but with 
  aerosol size distribution predicted rather than prescribed. The larger forcing 
  is due to the absence of lower bounds on droplet and aerosol number concentrations 
  in the simulations by Ghan et al. (2001a). Studies by Rotstayn (1999) and Jones 
  et al. (1999) both indicate that the positive long-wave forcing associated with 
  the indirect aerosol effect is small (between 0.0 and 0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for each of the 
  effects).</p>
<p>The partitioning of the total indirect radiative impact between the first and 
  second effect is uncertain. Jones et al. (1999) found that the ratio between 
  their best estimates of the first and second indirect effects, taken separately, 
  was 1.38, while Lohmann et al. (2000) predicted a ratio of 0.71 (for sulphate 
  and carbonaceous aerosols taken together). Rotstayn (1999) and Lohmann et al. 
  (2000) estimated that the radiative impact for the combined effects was of similar 
  magnitude than the sum of the two effects considered separately. In contrast, 
  Jones et al. (1999) found that the combined radiative impact (-1.18 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) was 
  less than the sum of the two effects (estimated as -0.91 and -0.66 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, 
  yielding a sum of -1.57 Wm<sup>-2</sup>).</p>
<h4><a name="6823"></a>6.8.2.3 Further discussion of uncertainties</h4>
<p>Some authors have argued that sea salt particles may compete with sulphate 
  aerosols as cloud condensation nuclei, thereby reducing the importance of anthropogenic 
  sulphate in droplet nucleation (Ghan et al., 1998; O'Dowd et al., 1999). 
  While this process is empirically accounted for in some of the above mentioned 
  estimates (e.g., Jones et al., 1999), it certainly adds further uncertainty 
  to the estimates. Considerable sensitivity is found to the parametrization of 
  the autoconversion process (Boucher et al., 1995; Lohmann and Feichter, 1997; 
  Delobbe and Gall&eacute;e, 1998; Jones et al., 1999) which complicates matters 
  because there is a need to "tune" the autoconversion onset in GCMs 
  (Boucher et al., 1995; Fowler et al., 1996; Rotstayn, 1999, 2000) to which the 
  indirect aerosol forcing is sensitive (Jones et al., 1999; Rotstayn, 1999; Ghan 
  et al., 2001a). The indirect aerosol forcing is also sensitive to the treatment 
  of the pre-industrial aerosol concentration and properties (Jones et al., 1999; 
  Lohmann et al., 2000) which remain poorly characterised, the representation 
  of the microphysics of mid-level clouds (Lohmann et al., 2000), the representation 
  of aerosol size distribution (Ghan et al., 2001a), the parametrization of sub-grid 
  scale clouds, the horizontal resolution of the GCM (Ghan et al., 2001a), and 
  the ability of GCMs to simulate the stratocumulus cloud fields. Finally, it 
  should be noted that all the studies discussed above cannot be considered as 
  truly "independent" because many of them (with the exceptions of Lohmann 
  et al. (2000) and Ghan et al. (2001a)) use similar methodologies and similar 
  relationships between sulphate mass and cloud droplet number concentration. 
  Therefore it is suspected that the range of model results does not encompass 
  the total range of uncertainties. In an overall sense, it can be concluded that 
  the considerable sensitivities to the treatment of microphysical details associated 
  with aerosol-cloud interactions, and their linkages with macroscopic cloud and 
  circulation parameters, remain to be thoroughly explored.</p>
