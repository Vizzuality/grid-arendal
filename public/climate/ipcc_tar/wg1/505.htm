<h4>14.2.2.2 Balancing the need for finer scales and the need for ensembles</h4>
<p>There is a natural tendency to produce models at finer spatial scales that 
  include both a wider array of processes and more refined descriptions. Higher 
  resolution can lead to better simulations of atmospheric dynamics and hydrology 
  (<a href="335.htm#891">Chapter 8, Section 8.9.1</a>), less diffusive oceanic 
  simulations, and improved representation of topography. In the atmosphere, fine-scale 
  topography is particularly important for resolving small-scale precipitation 
  patterns (see <a href="335.htm#891">Chapter 8, Section 8.9.1</a>). In the ocean, 
  bottom topography is very important for the various boundary flows (see <a href="285.htm">Chapter 
  7, Section 7.3.4</a>). The use of higher oceanic resolution also improves the 
  simulation of internal variability such as ENSO (see <a href="330.htm#871">Chapter 
  8, Section 8.7.1</a>). However, in spite of the use of higher resolution, important 
  climatic processes are still not resolved by the model's grid, necessitating 
  the continued use of sub-grid scale parametrizations. <br>
</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the grids used in the ocean sub-components of the coupled 
  climate models will begin to resolve eddies by the next report. As the oceanic 
  eddies become resolved by the grid, the need for large diffusion coefficients 
  and various mixing schemes should be reduced (see <a href="335.htm#893">Chapter 
  8, Section 8.9.3</a>; see also, however, the discussion in <a href="335.htm#892">Section 
  8.9.2</a>). In addition, the amount of diapycnal mixing, which is used for numerical 
  stability in this class of ocean models, will also be reduced as the grid spacing 
  becomes smaller. This reduction in the sub-grid scale oceanic mixing should 
  reduce the uncertainty associated with the mixing schemes and coefficients currently 
  being used.<br>
</p>
<p>Underlying this issue of scale and detail is an important tension. As the spatial 
  and process detail in a model is increased, the required computing resources 
  increase, often significantly; models with less detail may miss important non-linear 
  dynamics and feedbacks that affect model results significantly, and yet simpler 
  models may be more appropriate to generating the needed statistics. The issue 
  of spatial detail is intertwined with the representation of the physical (and 
  other) processes, and hence the need for a balance between level of process 
  detail and spatial detail. These tensions must be recognised forthrightly, and 
  strategies must be devised to use the available computing resources wisely. 
  Analyses to determine the benefits of finer scale and increased resolution need 
  to be carefully considered. These considerations must also recognise that the 
  potential predictive capability will be unavoidably statistical, and hence it 
  must be produced with statistically relevant information. This implies that 
  a variety of integrations (and models) must be used to produce an ensemble of 
  climate states. Climate states are defined in terms of averages and statistical 
  quantities applying over a period typically of decades (see <a href="265.htm">Chapter 
  7, Section 7.1.3</a> and <a href="346.htm">Chapter 9, Section 9.2.2</a>).<br>
</p>
<p>Fortunately, many groups have performed ensemble integrations, that is, multiple 
  integrations with a single model using identical radiative forcing scenarios 
  but different initial conditions. Ensemble integrations yield estimates of the 
  variability of the response for a given model. They are also useful in determining 
  to what extent the initial conditions affect the magnitude and pattern of the 
  response. Furthermore, many groups have now performed model integrations using 
  similar radiative forcings. This allows ensembles of model results to be constructed 
  (see <a href="349.htm">Chapter 9, Section 9.3</a>; see also the end of <a href="265.htm">Chapter 
  7, Section 7.1.3</a> for an interesting question about ensemble formation).<br>
</p>
<p>In sum, a strategy must recognise what is possible. In climate research and 
  modelling, we should recognise that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear 
  chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate 
  states is not possible. The most we can expect to achieve is the prediction 
  of the probability distribution of the system's future possible states 
  by the generation of ensembles of model solutions. This reduces climate change 
  to the discernment of significant differences in the statistics of such ensembles. 
  The generation of such model ensembles will require the dedication of greatly 
  increased computer resources and the application of new methods of model diagnosis. 
  Addressing adequately the statistical nature of climate is computationally intensive, 
  but such statistical information is essential. </p>
<h4><a name="14223"></a>14.2.2.3 Extreme events</h4>
<p>Extreme events are, almost by definition, of particular importance to human 
  society. Consequently, the importance of understanding potential extreme events 
  is first order. The evidence is mixed, and data continue to be lacking to make 
  conclusive cases. <a href="359.htm">Chapter 9, Sections 9.3.5</a> and <a href="364.htm">9.3.6</a> 
  consider projections of changes in patterns of variability (discussed in the 
  next section) and changes in extreme events (see also <a href="048.htm">Chapters 
  2</a> and <a href="373.htm">10</a>). Though the conclusions are mixed in both 
  of these topical areas, certain results begin to appear robust. There appear 
  to be some consistent patterns with increased CO<sub>2</sub> with respect to changes in 
  variability: (a) the Pacific climate base state could be a more El Ni&ntilde;o-like 
  state and (b) an enhanced variability in the daily precipitation in the Asian 
  summer monsoon with increased precipitation intensity (<a href="359.htm">Chapter 
  9, Section 9.3.5</a>). More generally, the intensification of the hydrological 
  cycle with increased CO<sub>2</sub> is a robust conclusion. For possible changes in extreme 
  weather and climate events, the most robust conclusions appear to be: (a) an 
  increased probability of extreme warm days and decreased probability of extreme 
  cold days and (b) an increased chance of drought for mid-continental areas during 
  summer with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> (see <a href="364.htm">Chapter 9, Section 9.3.6</a>). 
  <br>
</p>
<p>The evaluation of many types of extreme events is made difficult because of 
  issues of scale. Damaging extreme events are often at small temporal and spatial 
  scales. Intense, short-duration events are not well-represented (or not represented 
  at all) in model-simulated climates. In addition, there is often a basic mismatch 
  between the scales resolved in models and those of the validating data. A promising 
  approach is to use multi-fractal models of rainfall events in that they naturally 
  generate extreme events. Reanalysis has also helped in this regard, but reanalysis 
  per se is not the sole answer because the models used for reanalysis rely on 
  sub-grid scale parametrizations almost as heavily as climate models do. <br>
</p>
<p>One area that is possibly ripe for a direct attack on improving the modelling 
  of extreme events is tropical cyclones (see <a href="091.htm#2731">Section Chapter 
  2, 2.7.3.1</a>; <a href="334.htm#884">Chapter 8, Section 8.8.4</a>; <a href="367.htm">Chapter 
  9, Section 9.3.6.4</a>, and <a href="388.htm#box102">Chapter 10, Box 10.2</a>). 
  Also, there is the potential for increased understanding of extreme events by 
  employing regional climate models (RCMs); however, there are also challenges 
  to realising this potential (see <a href="373.htm">Chapter 10</a>). It must 
  be established that RCMs produce more realistic extremes than general circulation 
  models (GCMs). Most RCM simulations to date are not long enough (typically 5 
  or 10 years for nested climate change simulations) to evaluate extremes well 
  (see <a href="393.htm">Chapter 10, Section 10.5.2</a>). <br>
</p>
<p>Another area in which developments are needed is that of extremes associated 
  with the land surface (flood and drought). There is still a mismatch between 
  the scale of climate models and the finer scales appropriate for surface hydrology. 
  This is particularly problematical for impact studies. For droughts there is 
  a basic issue of predictability; drought prediction is difficult regardless 
  of scale.<br>
</p>
<p>A particularly important issue is the adequacy of data needed to attack the 
  question of changes in extreme events. There have been recent advances in our 
  understanding of extremes in simulated climates (see, for example, Meehl et 
  al., 2000), but thus far the approach has not been very systematic. Atmospheric 
  Model Intercomparison Project 2 (AMIP2) provides an opportunity for a more systematic 
  approach: AMIP2 will be collecting and organising some of the high-frequency 
  data that are needed to study extremes. However, it must be recognised that 
  we are still unfortunately short of data for the quantitative assessment of 
  extremes on the global scale in the observed climate.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, it is often stated that the impacts of climate change will be felt 
  through changes in extremes because they stress our present day adaptations 
  to climate variability. What does this imply for the research agenda for the 
  human dimension side of climate studies?</p>
