<h3>6.6.3 Indirect Forcing by NO<sub>x</sub> Emissions</h3>
<p>Through production of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>, emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub> = 
  NO + NO<sub>2</sub>) lead to a positive radiative forcing of climate (warming), but by 
  affecting the concentration of OH they reduce the levels of CH<sub>4</sub>, providing a 
  negative forcing (cooling) which partly offsets the O<sub>3</sub> forcing. Due to non-linearities 
  in O<sub>3</sub> photochemical production together with differences in mixing regimes and 
  removal processes, the O<sub>3</sub> and OH changes strongly depend on the localisation 
  of the NO<sub>x</sub> surface emission perturbation, as calculated by Hauglustaine and 
  Granier (1995), Johnson and Derwent (1996), Berntsen et al. (1996), Fuglestvedt 
  et al. (1996, 1999) and Gupta et al. (1998). The CH<sub>4</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> forcings are similar 
  in magnitude, but opposite in sign, as calculated by Fuglestvedt et al. (1999). 
  Due to differences in CH<sub>4</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> lifetimes, the NO<sub>x</sub> perturbation on the CH<sub>4</sub> 
  forcing acts on a global scale over a period of approximately a decade, while 
  the O<sub>3</sub> forcing is of regional character and occurs over a period of weeks. Based 
  on three-dimensional model results, Fuglestvedt et al. (1999) have calculated 
  that the O<sub>3</sub> radiative forcing per change in NO<sub>x</sub> emission (10-2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> per TgN/yr) 
  is 0.35 and 0.29 for the USA and Scandinavia, respectively, and reaches 2.4 
  for Southeast Asia. The CH<sub>4</sub> forcing per change in NO<sub>x</sub> emission ranges from -0.37 
  (Scandinavia) and -0.5 (USA) to -2.3 (Southeast Asia) in the same units. Additional 
  work is required to assess the impact of NO<sub>x</sub> on the radiative forcing of climate.</p>
<p>Deep convection can remove pollutants from the lower atmosphere and inject 
  them rapidly into the middle and upper troposphere and, occasionally, into the 
  stratosphere. Changes in convective regimes associated with climate changes 
  have therefore the potential to significantly modify the distribution and the 
  photochemistry of O<sub>3</sub> in a region where its impact on the radiative forcing is 
  the largest. Based on the tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> column derived from satellite during 
  the 1997 to 1998 El Ni&ntilde;o, Chandra et al. (1998) reported a decrease in 
  O<sub>3</sub> column of 4 to 8 Dobson Units (DU) in the eastern Pacific and an increase 
  of 10 to 20 DU in the western Pacific, largely as a result of the eastward shift 
  of the tropical convective activity. Lelieveld and Crutzen (1994) showed that 
  convective transport can change the budget of O<sub>3</sub> in the troposphere. Berntsen 
  and Isaksen (1999) have also indicated that changes in convection can modify 
  the sensitivity of the atmosphere to anthropogenic perturbations as aircraft 
  emissions. Their study indicates that reduced convective activity leads to a 
  40% increase in the O<sub>3</sub> response to aircraft NO<sub>x</sub> emissions due to modified background 
  atmospheric concentrations. In addition to that, lightning is a major source 
  of NO<sub>x</sub> in the troposphere and thus contributes to the photochemical production 
  of O<sub>3</sub> (Huntrieser et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1998; Hauglustaine et al., 2001; 
  Lelieveld and Dentener, 2000). In the tropical mid- and upper troposphere, modelling 
  studies by Lamarque et al. (1996), Levy et al. (1996), Penner et al. (1998a), 
  and Allen et al. (2000) have calculated a contribution of lightning to the NO<sub>x</sub> levels of 60 to 90% during summer. Direct observations by Solomon et al. (1999) 
  of absorption of visible radiation indicate that nitrogen dioxide can lead to 
  local instantaneous radiative forcing exceeding 1 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. These enhancements of 
  NO<sub>2</sub> absorption are likely to be due both to pollution and to production by lightning 
  in convective clouds. Further measurements are required to bracket the direct 
  radiative forcing by NO<sub>2</sub> under a variety of storm and pollution conditions. 
  On the basis of two-dimensional model calculations, Toumi et al. (1996) calculated 
  that for a 20% increase of lightning the global mean radiative forcing by enhanced 
  tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> production is about 0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. Based on an apparent correlation 
  between lightning strike rates and surface temperatures, Sinha and Toumi (1997) 
  have suggested a positive climate feedback through O<sub>3</sub> production from lightning NO<sub>x</sub> in a warmer climate. Improved modelling and observations are required to 
  confirm this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Aircraft emissions also have the potential to alter the composition of the 
  atmosphere and induce a radiative forcing of climate. According to IPCC (1999), 
  in 1992 the NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from subsonic aircraft are estimated to have increased 
  O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at cruise altitudes in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude 
  summer by about 6% compared with an atmosphere without aircraft. The associated 
  global mean radiative forcing is 0.023 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. In addition to increasing tropospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub>, aircraft NO<sub>x</sub> are expected to decrease the concentration of CH<sub>4</sub> inducing 
  a negative radiative forcing of -0.014 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for the 1992 aircraft fleet. Again, 
  due to different O<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> lifetimes, the two forcings show very different 
  spatial distribution and seasonal evolution (IPCC, 1999). The O<sub>3</sub> forcing shows 
  a marked maximum at northern mid-latitudes, reaching 0.06 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, whilst the CH<sub>4</sub> 
  forcing exhibits a more uniform distribution, with a maximum of about -0.02 
  Wm<sup>-2</sup> in the tropical regions. Based on IPCC (1999), the O<sub>3</sub> forcing calculated 
  for 2050 conditions is 0.060 Wm<sup>-2</sup> and the CH<sub>4</sub> forcing is -0.045 Wm<sup>-2</sup>.</p>
