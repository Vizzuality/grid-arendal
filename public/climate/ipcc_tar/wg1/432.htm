<h3><a name="1152"></a>11.5.2 Regional Sea Level Change </h3>
<p>The geographical distribution of sea level change caused by ocean processes 
  can be calculated from AOGCM results (see Gregory et al., 2001, for methods). 
  This was not possible with the simple climate models used by Warrick et al. 
  (1996). Results for sea level change from ocean processes in the 21st century 
  are shown in <a href="430.htm#fig1113">Figure 11.13</a> for AOGCM experiments 
  used in <a href="429.htm#11511">Section 11.5.1.1</a>. Some regions show a sea 
  level rise substantially more than the global average (in many cases of more 
  than twice the average), and others a sea level fall (<a href="430.htm#tab1115">Table 
  11.15</a>) (note that these figures do not include sea level rise due to land 
  ice changes). The standard deviation of sea level change is 15 to 35% of the 
  global average sea level rise from thermal expansion.</p>
<a name="fig1116"></a>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" align="right">
  <tr> 
    <td class="figure"><b><a href="fig11-16.htm"><img src="images/fig11-16s.gif" width="300" height="206" border="0"></a><br>
      Figure 11.16: </b>Response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to three climatic 
      warming scenarios during the third millennium expressed in equivalent changes 
      of global sea level. The curve labels refer to the mean annual temperature 
      rise over Greenland by 3000 AD as predicted by a two-dimensional climate 
      and ocean model forced by greenhouse gas concentration rises until 2130 
      AD and kept constant after that. (From Huybrechts and De Wolde, 1999.) Note 
      that projected temperatures over Greenland are generally greater than globally 
      averaged temperatures (by a factor of 1.2 to 3.1 for the range of AOGCMs 
      used in this chapter). See <a href="427.htm#tab1113">Table 11.13</a> and 
      <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="351.htm#fig910">Fig 9.10c</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In each of these experiments, a non-uniform pattern of sea level rise emerges 
  above the background of temporal variability in the latter part of the 21st 
  century. However, the patterns given by the different models (<a href="430.htm#fig1113">Figure 
  11.13</a>) are not similar in detail. The largest correlations are between models 
  which are similar in formulation: 0.65 between CGCM1 and CGCM2, 0.63 between 
  GFDL_R15_b and GFDL_R30_c. The largest correlations between models from different 
  centres are 0.60 between CSIRO Mk2 and HadCM2, 0.58 between CGCM2 and GFDL_R30_c. 
  The majority of correlations are less than 0.4, indicating no significant similarity 
  (Gregory et al., 2001). The disagreement between models is partly a reflection 
  of the differences in ocean model formulation that are also responsible for 
  the spread in the global average heat uptake and thermal expansion (<a href="412.htm">Sections 
  11.2.1.2</a>, <a href="429.htm#11511">11.5.1.1</a>). In addition, the models 
  predict different changes in surface windstress, with consequences for changes 
  in ocean circulation and subduction. More detailed analysis is needed to elucidate 
  the reasons for the differences in patterns. The lack of similarity means that 
  our confidence in predictions of local sea level changes is low. However, we 
  can identify a few common features on the regional and basin scale (see also 
  Gregory et al., 2001).</p>
<p>Seven of the nine models in <a href="428.htm#tab1114">Table 11.14</a> (also 
  Bryan, 1996; Russell et al., 2000) exhibit a maximum sea level rise in the Arctic 
  Ocean. A possible reason for this is a freshening of the Arctic due to increased 
  river runoff or precipitation over the ocean (Bryan, 1996; Miller and Russell, 
  2000). The fall in salinity leads to a reduction of density, which requires 
  a compensating sea level rise in order to maintain the pressure gradient at 
  depth. </p>
<p>Seven of the models (also Gregory, 1993; Bryan, 1996) show a minimum of sea 
  level rise in the circumpolar Southern Ocean south of 60&deg;S. This occurs 
  despite the fact that the Southern Ocean is a region of pronounced heat uptake 
  (e.g., Murphy and Mitchell, 1995; Hirst et al., 1996). The low thermal expansion 
  coefficient at the cold temperatures of the high southern latitudes, changes 
  in wind patterns and transport of the heat taken up to lower latitudes are all 
  possible explanations.</p>
<p>Bryan (1996) draws attention to a dipole pattern in sea level change in the 
  north-west Atlantic; there is a reduced rise south of the Gulf Stream extension 
  and enhanced rise to the north, which corresponds to a weakening of the sea 
  surface gradient across the current. This would be consistent with a weakening 
  of the upper branch of the North Atlantic circulation, which is a response to 
  greenhouse warming observed in many AOGCM experiments (e.g., Manabe and Stouffer, 
  1993, 1994; Hirst, 1998). This can be seen in all the models considered here 
  except ECHAM4/OPYC3, in which the Atlantic thermohaline circulation does not 
  weaken (Latif and Roeckner, 2000).</p>
<p>Local land movements, both isostatic and tectonic (<a href="419.htm#11241">Sections 
  11.2.4.1</a>, <a href="422.htm">11.2.6</a>), will continue in the 21st century 
  at rates which are unaffected by climate change, and should be added to the 
  regional variation described in this section. On account of the increased eustatic 
  rate of rise in the 21st century (<a href="429.htm#1151">Section 11.5.1</a>) 
  it can be expected that by 2100 many regions currently experiencing relative 
  sea level fall owing to isostatic rebound will instead have a rising relative 
  sea level.</p>
<p>All the global models discussed here have a spatial resolution of 1 to 3&deg;. 
  To obtain information about mean sea level changes at higher resolution is currently 
  not practical; a regional model such as that of Kauker (1998) would be needed.</p>
