<h4>5.4.1.4 Comparison of modelled and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth</h4>
<p>Comparison of model results with remote surface observations of the major components 
  making up the composition of the atmospheric aerosol provide a test of whether 
  the models treat transport and removal of individual species adequately. But 
  as noted above, the difference between the vertical distribution of species 
  among the models is significant (i.e. a difference of more than a factor of 
  2 in the upper troposphere) and the global average abundance of individual components 
  varies significantly (more than a factor of 2) between the models, especially 
  for components such as dust and sea salt. Two methods have been used to try 
  to understand whether the models adequately treat the total aerosol abundance. 
  The first, comparison of total optical depth with satellite measurements, was 
  employed by Tegen et al. (1997), while the second, comparison of total reflected 
  short-wave radiation with satellite observations, was employed by Haywood et 
  al. (1999). We examined both measures in an effort to understand whether the 
  model-predicted forcing associated with aerosols is adequate.</p>

<p><a name="fig511"></a><a href="#fig511">Figure 5.11</a> shows the zonal average 
  optical depth deduced from AVHRR data for 1990 by Nakajima and Higurashi (Nakajima 
  et al., 1999) and for an average of the time period February 1985 to October 
  1988 by Mishchenko et al. (1999) and by Stowe et al. (1997). The two results 
  from Nakajima et al. (1999) demonstrate the sensitivity of the retrieved optical 
  depth to the assumed particle size distribution. Results from the models which 
  participated in the intercomparison workshop are also included. Because the 
  GISS, CCM1, ECHAM/GRANTOUR and ULAQ models all used the same sources, the differences 
  between these models are due to model parametrization procedures. The GOCART 
  (GSFC) model used a source distribution for sea salt that was derived from daily 
  varying special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I; Atlas et al., 1996) winds for 
  1990 and was, on average, 55% larger than the baseline sea salt source specified 
  for the model workshop. The MPI/Dalhousie model used monthly average dust and 
  sea salt distributions from prior CCM1 model simulations (cf., Lohmann et al., 
  1999b,c). <br>
  <br>
  Workshop participants were asked to report their derived optical depths. However, 
  these varied widely and were often much smaller than that derived here. Therefore, 
  we constructed the optical depths shown in <a href="#fig511">Figure 5.11</a> 
  from the frequency distribution of relative humidity from the T21 version of 
  the ECHAM 3.6 general circulation model, together with the reported monthly 
  average distributions of aerosol mixing ratios. The model optical depths were 
  derived using extinction coefficients at 0.55 mm for dry sea salt of 3.45 m2g-1, 
  0.69 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>, and 0.20 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup> for diameters 
  in the size range from 0.2 to 2 mm, 2.0 to 8 mm and 8 to 20 mm, respectively, 
  and an extinction coefficient of 9.94 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup> for sulphate. 
  The humidity dependence of the extinction for sea salt and dust was determined 
  using the model described in Penner et al. (1999a). The dust extinction coefficients 
  were from Tegen et al. (1997) and organic and black carbon extinction coefficients 
  for 80% relative humidity were from Haywood et al. (1999). We also examined 
  the sensitivity of the modelled optical depths to a factor of two increase in 
  the DMS flux and to the use of monthly average sea salt fluxes derived using 
  the SSM/I wind fields. The OC and BC extinction coefficients were also varied, 
  adding the humidity dependence determined by Penner et al. (1998b). Finally, 
  the extinction coefficient for sulphate was altered to that calculated for an 
  assumed ratio of total NH<sub>3</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> 
  of four. The line in the graph labelled "summed sensitivity study" 
  shows the results for the ECHAM/GRANTOUR model when these para-meters were varied. 
  Most of the difference between the summed sensitivity case and that for the 
  baseline ECHAM/GRANTOUR model is due to the use of larger DMS and sea salt fluxes.<br>
</p>
<p> The satellite-derived optical depths from Stowe et al. (1997) are lower on 
  average by 0.05 and by 0.03 than those from Mischenko et al. (1999) and result 
  2 from Nakajima et al. (1999), respectively. The latter two retrievals make 
  use of a two-wavelength technique which is thought to be more accurate than 
  the one-wavelenth technique of Stowe et al. (1997). However, it is worth bearing 
  in mind that most of the difference in retrieved aerosol optical depth may be 
  related to cloud screening techniques (Mishchenko et al., 1999) or to assumed 
  size distribution (Nakajima et al., 1999).<br>
</p>
<p> Modelled optical depths north of 30&deg;N are sometimes higher and sometimes 
  lower than those of the retrieved AVHRR optical depths. For example, there is 
  an average difference of 0.13 in July for the ULAQ model in comparison with 
  result 2 for Nakajima et al. (1999) while the average difference is -0.09 in 
  January for the ECHAM/GRANTOUR model in comparison with the retrieved optical 
  depths from Mishchenko et al. (1999). The modelled optical depths in the latitude 
  band from 30&deg;N and 40&deg;N are systematically too high in July. For example, 
  the average of the modelled optical depths is larger than the satellite-derived 
  optical depth of Nakajima, Mishchenko, and Stowe on average by 0.06, 0.05 and 
  0.04, respectively. We note that sulphate and dust provide the largest components 
  of optical depth in this region with sea salt providing the third most important 
  component. Since the sources represent the year 2000, while the measured optical 
  depths refer to an average of the years 1985 to 1988, some of the overprediction 
  of optical depth may be associated with higher sources than the time period 
  of the measurements. The black dashed line shows the estimated optical depths 
  from the ECHAM/GRANTOUR model with the larger sea salt fluxes deduced from the 
  SSM/I winds, with doubled DMS flux, and with optical properties for an assumed 
  ratio of total NO<sub>3</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> of 4:1. Comparison 
  of these results with those of the retrieved optical depths shows that the uncertainties 
  in these parameters lead to changes in optical depth that are of the order of 
  0.05 or more. <br>
