<h4><a name="2222"></a>2.2.2.2 Sea surface temperature and ocean air temperature</h4>
<p>The analyses of SST described here all estimate the sub-surface bulk temperature, 
  (i.e. the temperature in the first few metres of the ocean) not the skin temperature. 
  Thus the Reynolds and Smith (1994) and Smith et al. (1996) data, which incorporate 
  polar orbiting satellite temperatures, utilise skin temperatures that have been 
  adjusted to estimate bulk SST values through a calibration procedure.<br>

<p>Many historical in situ marine data still remain to be digitised and incorporated 
  into the database, to improve coverage and reduce the uncertainties in our estimates 
  of marine climatic variations. A combined physical-empirical method (Folland 
  and Parker, 1995) is used, as in the SAR, to estimate adjustments to ships' 
  SST data obtained up to 1941 to compensate for heat losses from uninsulated 
  (mainly canvas) or partly-insulated (mainly wooden) buckets (see <a href="#box22">Box 
  2.2</a>). The corrections are independent of the land-surface air temperature 
  data. Confirmation that these spatially and temporally complex adjustments are 
  quite realistic globally is emerging from simulations of the Jones (1994) land-surface 
  air temperature anomalies using the Hadley Centre atmospheric climate model 
  HadAM3 forced with observed SST and sea-ice extents since 1871, updated from 
  Rayner et al. (1996). <a href="#fig24">Figure 2.4</a> (Folland et al., 2001) 
  shows simulations of global land-surface air temperature anomalies in model 
  runs forced with SST, with and without bias adjustments to the SST data before 
  1942. All runs with uncorrected SST (only the average is shown) give too cold 
  a simulation of land-surface air temperature for much of the period before 1941 
  relative to the 1946 to 1965 base period, with a dramatic increase in 1942. 
  All six individual runs with bias-adjusted SST (only the average is shown) give 
  simulated land air temperatures close to those observed so that internal model 
  variability is small on decadal time-scales compared to the signal being sought. 
  These global results are mostly confirmed by ten similar large regional land-surface 
  air temperature analyses (not shown). Hanawa et al. (2000) have provided independent 
  confirmation of the SST bias corrections around Japan. Therefore, our confidence 
  in the SST data sets has increased. Marine data issues are discussed further 
  in <a href="#box22">Box 2.2</a>, in Trenberth et al. (1992) and Folland et al. 
  (1993).</p>
<p><a href="#fig25">Figure 2.5a</a> shows annual values of global 
  SST, using a recently improved UKMO analysis that does not fill regions of missing 
  data (Jones et al., 2001), together with decadally smoothed values of SST from 
  the same analysis. NMAT is also shown. These generally agree well after 1900, 
  but NMAT data are warmer before that time with a slow cooling trend from 1860 
  not seen in the SSTs, though the minimum around 1910 is seen in both series. 
  The SST analysis from the SAR is also shown. The changes in SST since the SAR 
  are generally fairly small, though the peak warmth in the early 1940s is more 
  evident in the more recent analysis, supported by the NMAT analysis. A contribution 
  to decadally averaged global warmth at that time is likely to have arisen from 
  closely spaced multiple El Ni&ntilde;o events centred near 1939 to 1941 and 
  perhaps 1942 to 1944 (Bigg and Inonue, 1992; and <a href="083.htm#fig229">Figure 
  2.29</a>). The NMAT data largely avoid daytime heating of ships' decks (Bottomley 
  et al., 1990; Folland and Parker, 1995). Although NMAT data have been corrected 
  for warm biases in World War II they may still be too warm in the Northern Hemisphere 
  at that time (<a href="#fig25">Figure 2.5c</a>), though there 
  is good agreement in the Southern Hemisphere (<a href="#fig25">Figure 
  2.5d</a>). The NMAT analysis is based on that in Parker et al. (1995) but differs 
  from that used in the SAR in that it incorporates optimal interpolated data 
  using orthogonal spatial patterns (eigenvectors). This is similar to the technique 
  described by Kaplan et al. (1997, 1998) but with additional allowance for non-stationarity 
  of the data (Parker et al, 1995). Great care is needed in making these reconstructions 
  in a changing climate, as pointed out by Hurrell and Trenberth (1999). This 
  NMAT analysis has been chosen because of the often very sparse data. NMAT confirms 
  the SST trends in the 20th century until 1991 (see also <a href="053.htm#tab21">Table 
  2.1</a>). After 1991, NMAT warmed at a slower rate than SST in parts of the 
  Southern Hemisphere, notably the South Indian and the tropical South Pacific 
  Oceans. Overall, however, the SST data should be regarded as more reliable, 
  though the relative changes in NMAT since 1991 may be partly real (Christy et 
  al., 2001). The similar trends in SST and island air temperature found by Folland 
  et al. (1997) for four regions of the tropical and extra-tropical South Pacific 
  over much of the last century support the generally greater reliability of the 
  SST data.</p>
<p><a href="#fig25">Figure 2.5b</a> shows three time-series of changes in global 
  SST. The UKMO series (as in <a href="#fig25">Figure 2.5a</a>) does not include 
  polar orbiting satellite data because of possible time-varying biases in them 
  that remain difficult to correct fully (Reynolds, 1993) though the NCEP (National 
  Centers for Environmental Prediction) data (adapted from Smith et al., 1996 
  and Reynolds and Smith, 1994), starting in 1950, do include satellite data after 
  1981.</p>
<p>The NCDC series (updated from Quayle et al., 1999) starts in 1880 and includes 
  satellite data to provide nearly complete global coverage. Up to 1981, the Quayle 
  et al series is based on the UKMO series, adjusted by linear regression to match 
  the NCEP series after 1981. It has a truly global coverage based on the optimally 
  interpolated Reynolds and Smith data. The Kaplan et al. (1998) global analysis 
  is not shown because it makes no allowance for non-stationarity (here the existence 
  of global warming) in its optimum interpolation procedures, as noted by Hurrell 
  and Trenberth (1999). The warmest year globally in each SST record was 1998 
  (UKMO, 0.43&deg;C, NCDC, 0.39&deg;C, and NCEP, 0.34&deg;C, above the 1961 to 
  1990 average). The latter two analyses are in principle affected by artificially 
  reduced trends in the satellite data (Hurrell and Trenberth, 1999), though the 
  data we show include recent attempts to reduce this. The global SST show mostly 
  similar trends to those of the land-surface air temperature until 1976, but 
  the trend since 1976 is markedly less (<a href="053.htm#tab21">Table 
  2.1</a>). NMAT trends are not calculated from 1861, as they are too unreliable. 
  The difference in trend between global SST and global land air temperature since 
  1976 does not appear to be significant, but the trend in NMAT (despite any residual 
  data problems) does appear to be less than that in the land air temperature 
  since 1976. <a href="055.htm#fig25">Figures 2.5c</a> and d show 
  that NMAT and SST trends remain very similar in the Northern Hemisphere to the 
  end of the record, but diverge rather suddenly in the Southern Hemisphere from 
  about 1991, as mentioned above. The five warmest years in each of the UKMO, 
  NCDC and NCEP SST analyses have occurred after 1986, four of them in the 1990s 
  in the UKMO analysis.</p>
<p>Particularly strong warming has occurred in the extra-tropical North Atlantic 
  since the mid-1980s (approximately 35&deg; to 65&deg;N, 0&deg; to 35&deg;W not 
  shown). This warming appears to be related in part to the warming phase of a 
  multi-decadal fluctuation (Folland et al., 1986, 1999a; Delworth and Mann, 2000; 
  see <a href="083.htm#26">Section 2.6</a>), perhaps not confined to the North 
  Atlantic (Minobe, 1997; Chao et al., 2000), though global warming is likely 
  to be contributing too. In addition, the cooling in the north-western North 
  Atlantic south of Greenland, reported in the SAR, has ceased. These features 
  were noted by Hansen et al. (1999). </p>

      <div align="center"><b>Box 2.2: Adjustments and Corrections to Marine Observations. 
        </b> </div>
      <p>The SST data used here comprise over 80 million observations from the 
        UK Main Marine Data Bank, the United States Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere 
        Data Set (COADS) and recent information telecommunicated from ships and 
        buoys from the World Weather Watch. These observations have been carefully 
        checked for homogeneity and carefully corrected for the use of uninsulated 
        wooden and canvas buckets for collecting seawater prior to 1942. However, 
        corrections prior to about 1900 are less well known because of uncertainties 
        in the mix of wooden and canvas buckets. Nevertheless, <a href="#fig24">Figure 
        2.4</a> provides good evidence that even in the 1870s, SST was little 
        biased relative to land-surface air temperatures globally. Since 1941, 
        observations mainly come from ship engine intake measurements, better 
        insulated buckets and, latterly, from buoys. SST anomalies (from a 1961 
        to 1990 average) are first averaged into 1&deg; latitude by 1&deg; longitude 
        boxes for five-day periods; the anomaly for a given observation is calculated 
        from a 1&deg; box climatology that changes each day throughout the year. 
        The five-day 1&deg; box anomalies are then aggregated into 5&deg; boxes 
        for the whole month with outlying values rejected, and monthly average 
        anomalies calculated. Further adjustments are made to monthly SST anomalies 
        for the varying numbers of observations in each 5&deg; box because when 
        observations are few, random errors tend to increase the variance of the 
        monthly mean. NMAT data are treated similarly and have quite similar characteristics. 
        However, a variance adjustment to NMAT data is not yet made. NMAT data 
        are also corrected for the progressive increase in the height of thermometer 
        screens on ships above the ocean surface, though no corrections have been 
        made since 1930. Because there are only about half as many NMAT as SST 
        data and NMAT have smaller temporal persistence, monthly NMAT anomalies 
        may be less representative than SST anomalies even on quite large space 
        scales. On longer time-scales, and over the majority of large ocean regions 
        in the 20th century, there is good agreement between NMAT and SST. 19th 
        century NMAT anomaly time-series should be viewed cautiously because of 
        the sparse character of the constituent observations, and regionally varying 
        biases, only some of which have been corrected.</p>
