<h3>14.3.2 Humans: Drivers of Global Change: Recipients of Global Change</h3>
<p>The provision of useful guidance to inform policy requires observation and 
  description of human contributions to global change, as well as theoretical 
  studies of the underlying social processes that shape them. We also need to 
  understand how global change affects human welfare. This requires not merely 
  studies of direct exposure but also of the capacity to respond.<br>
</p>
<p>Causal models of social processes have large uncertainties, and pose problems 
  that are of a qualitatively different character than those encountered in modelling 
  non-human components of the Earth system. This is due, first and foremost, to 
  the inherent reflexivity of human behaviour; i.e., the fact that human beings 
  have intellectual capabilities and emotional endowments enabling them to invent 
  new solutions and transcend established "laws" in ways that no other 
  species can do. As a consequence, predictive models may well alter the behaviour 
  that they seek to predict and explain - indeed, such models are sometimes 
  deliberately used exactly for that purpose. Moreover, the diversity of societies, 
  cultures, and political and economic systems often frustrates attempts to generalise 
  findings and propositions from one setting to another. Representation of human 
  behaviour at the micro (individual) and macro (collective) scale may require 
  fundamentally different approaches (see Gibson et al., 1998).<br>
</p>
<p>These kinds of difficulties intrinsically limit the predictive power that can 
  be ascribed to models of social processes. As a consequence, research on human 
  drivers and responses to climate change cannot be expected to produce conventional 
  predictions beyond a very short time horizon. This does not imply, however, 
  that research on human behaviour and social processes cannot provide knowledge 
  and insight that can inform policy deliberations. A considerable amount of basic 
  knowledge and insight exist, and this knowledge can be used, inter alia, for 
  constructing scenarios showing plausible trajectories and identifying the critical 
  factors that will have to be targeted in order to switch from one trajectory 
  to another. From the perspective of policy-makers, this can indeed be an important 
  contribution.<br>
</p>
<p>To make the most of this potential, further progress is required along two 
  main frontiers. One challenge is to develop a more integrated understanding 
  of social systems and human behaviour. With some exceptions, the first generation 
  of models in this area represented "the human system" by a few key 
  variables. For example, resource use was often conceived of as a function of 
  population size and income level. The performance of such simplistic models 
  was by-and-large poor. It is abundantly clear that the impact of human activities 
  as drivers of climate change depends upon a complex set of interrelated factors, 
  including also technologies in use, social institutions, and individual beliefs, 
  attitudes, and values. At present, it seems fair to say that we have a reasonably 
  good theoretical grasp of important types of institutions, such as markets and 
  hierarchies, in ideal-type form. What we need to understand better is how their 
  impure real-world counterparts work, and to improve our understanding of the 
  intricate interplay of institutional complexes, i.e., how markets, governments 
  and other social institutions interact to shape human behaviour. Research in 
  political economy clearly indicates that phenomena such as economic growth are 
  to a significant extent affected by the functioning of interlocking networks 
  of institutional arrangements. <br>
</p>
<p>Similarly, we have a fairly good grasp on particular kinds of intellectual 
  processes - in particular, the logic of rational choice - but we are doing less 
  well when it comes to understanding how beliefs, attitudes and values change 
  and how change in these factors in turn affects manifest human behaviour, such 
  as consumption patterns. To address these challenges we need more interdisciplinary 
  research designed to integrate knowledge from different fields and sub-fields 
  into a more holistic understanding of "the human system". The intellectual 
  and organisational problems involved should not be underestimated, but we are 
  confident that the prospects for making progress along this frontier are better 
  now than ever before.<br>
</p>
<p>The other main challenge is to find better ways of integrating models of the 
  biogeophysical Earth system with models of social systems and human behaviour. 
  Some encouraging progress has been made at this interface, particularly over 
  the last decade. For example, there has been a rapid increase in attempts to 
  integrate representations of human activities in models with explicit formal 
  linkages to other components of the Earth system. Such integrated assessment 
  models have offered preliminary characterisations of human-climate linkages, 
  particularly through models of multiple linked human and climate stresses on 
  land cover. Moreover, they have provided preliminary characterisation of broad 
  classes of policy responses, and have been employed to characterise and prioritise 
  policy-relevant uncertainties. <br>
</p>
<p>Yet, effective integration is frustrated by at least two main obstacles. One 
  is incongruity of temporal and spatial scales. Social science research cannot 
  match the long time horizons of much natural science research. On the other 
  hand, in studying consequences for human welfare and responses to these consequences, 
  social scientists need estimates of biophysical impacts of climate change differentiated 
  by political units or even smaller social systems. Aggregate global-scale estimates 
  are of limited use in this context; human sensitivity to climate change varies 
  significantly across regions and social groups, and so does response capacity. 
  We can expect to see some progress in alleviating the spatial resolution problem, 
  as regional-scale models of climate change are further developed, but we have 
  to recognise that the scale problems are fundamental and that no quick fixes 
  are in sight. The other problem pertains to the interface between different 
  methodological approaches. In particular, concerted efforts are required to 
  develop better tools for coupling approaches relying on numerical modelling 
  with "softer" approaches using interpretative frameworks and qualitative 
  methods. Some of these differences are too profound to be eliminated, but that 
  does not imply that bridges cannot be built. Learning how to work more effectively 
  across these methodological divides is essential to the further development 
  of integrated global change research. Again, some encouraging progress is being 
  made.</p>
