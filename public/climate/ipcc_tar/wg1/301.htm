<h3>7.6.3 Monsoons and Teleconnections</h3>
<p>The weather and climate around the world in one place is generally strongly 
  linked to that in other places through atmospheric linkages. In the tropics 
  and sub-tropics, large-scale overturning in the atmosphere, which is manifested 
  as the seasonal monsoon variations, links the wet summer monsoons to the dry 
  subsiding regions usually in the tropics and sub-tropics of the winter hemisphere. 
  Throughout the world, teleconnections link neighbouring regions mainly through 
  large-scale, quasi-stationary atmospheric Rossby waves. A direct consequence 
  of these linkages is that some regions are wetter and/or hotter than the prevailing 
  global scale changes, while half a wavelength away the regions may be dryer 
  and/or cooler than the global pattern. Moreover, because of the way these patterns 
  set up relative to land and ocean, they can alter the global mean changes. In 
  addition, errors in models (such as in convection in the tropical Pacific) can 
  be manifested non-locally through teleconnections, e.g., in the North Pacific 
  SSTs (see <a href="315.htm#fig81">Figure 8.1a</a>), although other processes 
  are also involved.</p>
<p> The term "monsoon" is now generally applied to tropical and sub-tropical 
  seasonal reversals in both the atmospheric circulation and associated precipitation. 
  These changes arise from reversals in temperature gradients between continental 
  regions and the adjacent oceans with the progression of the seasons. The dominant 
  monsoon systems in the world are the Asian-Australian, African and the American 
  monsoons. As land heats faster than ocean in summer, heated air rises and draws 
  moist low-level maritime air inland where convection and release of latent heat 
  fuel the monsoon circulation. For the Asian monsoon, a regional meridional temperature 
  gradient extending from the tropical Indian Ocean north to mid-latitude Asia 
  develops prior to the monsoon through a considerable depth of the troposphere 
  (Webster et al., 1998). To a first order, the stronger this meridional temperature 
  gradient, the stronger the monsoon. Thus land-surface processes, such as soil 
  moisture and snow cover in Asia can influence the monsoon and, along with SST 
  variations, may induce quasi-biennial variability (Meehl, 1997). Additionally, 
  large-scale forcing associated with tropical Pacific SSTs influences monsoon 
  strength through the large-scale east-west overturning in the atmosphere. Anomalously 
  cold (warm) Pacific SSTs often are associated with a strong (weak) monsoon, 
  though these connections are somewhat intermittent.</p>
<p> Some teleconnections arise simply from natural preferred modes of the atmosphere 
  associated with the mean climate state and the land-sea distribution. Several 
  are directly linked to SST changes (Trenberth et al., 1998). The most prominent 
  are the Pacific-North American (PNA) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO; 
  see <a href="302.htm">Section 7.6.4</a>) in the Northern Hemisphere, and both 
  account for a substantial part of the pattern of northern hemispheric temperature 
  change, especially in winter (Hurrell, 1996), in part through the "cold 
  ocean warm land" (COWL) pattern (Wallace et al., 1995; Hurrell and Trenberth, 
  1996) (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>). Although evidently a prominent 
  mode of the atmosphere alone, the PNA is also influenced by changes in ENSO 
  (see <a href="303.htm">Section 7.6.5</a>). Thompson and Wallace (1998, 2000) 
  suggest that the NAO may be the regional manifestation of an annular (zonally 
  symmetric) hemispheric mode of variability characterised by a seesaw of atmospheric 
  mass between the polar cap and the middle latitudes in both the Atlantic and 
  Pacific Ocean basins and they call this the Arctic Oscillation (AO). A similar, 
  even more zonal structure is dominant in the Southern Hemisphere (Trenberth 
  et al., 1998) (the Southern Annular Mode, sometimes called the Antarctic Oscillation, 
  AAO). The vertical structure of both AO and AAO extends well into the stratosphere 
  (Perlwitz and Graf, 1995; Thompson and Wallace, 1998).</p>
<p> In the Atlantic, an important emerging coupled mode of variability is the 
  so-called tropical Atlantic dipole, which involves variations of opposite sign 
  in the sea level pressure field across the equatorial Atlantic and corresponding 
  variations in the ITCZ location. Given the background SST and wind fields, anomalous 
  SSTs of opposite sign across the equatorial region are apt to alter the surface 
  winds in such a way as to enhance or reduce evaporative cooling of the ocean 
  and reinforce the original SST pattern (Carton et al., 1996; Chang et al., 1997). 
  The ocean provides a decadal time-scale to the coupled interactions.</p>
<p> Dominant large-scale patterns of ocean-atmosphere interactions are also found 
  in the tropical Indian Ocean (Saji et al., 1999; Webster et al., 1999). They 
  have characteristics similar to El Ni&ntilde;o and are associated with large 
  east-west SST changes and a switch of the major tropical convection areas from 
  Africa to Indonesia. There are indications that this atmosphere-ocean process 
  is somewhat independent of ENSO and represents a natural mode of the tropical 
  Indian Ocean. </p>
<p> The vital processes for improved monsoon simulation in models are those associated 
  with the hydrological cycle, especially in the tropics. These include convection, 
  precipitation and other atmospheric processes (see <a href="266.htm">Section 
  7.2</a>) as well as land surface processes (see <a href="289.htm">Section 7.4</a>), 
  and interactions of the atmosphere with complex topography and with the ocean. 
  The difficulties in assembling all of these elements together has led to problems 
  in simulating mean precipitation as well as interannual monsoon variability, 
  although improvements are evident (Webster et al., 1998, and see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>, <a href="331.htm">Section 8.7.3</a>).</p>
<p> For teleconnections and regional climate patterns, not only are there demanding 
  requirements on simulating the variations in tropical SSTs that drive many of 
  the interannual and longer-term fluctuations through latent heating in the associated 
  tropical precipitation, but results also depend on the mean state of the atmosphere 
  through which Rossby waves propagate. Feedbacks from changes in storm tracks, 
  and thus momentum and heat transports by transient atmospheric disturbances, 
  as well as interactions with changed land-surface soil moisture from precipitation 
  changes and interactions with extra-tropical oceans are critical. While there 
  is scope for further improvements, great strides have been made in modelling 
  all these aspects in the recent years. </p>
