<p><i><a name="fig813"></a></i>Accurate simulation of current climate does not 
  guarantee the ability of a model to simulate climate change correctly. Climate 
  models now have some skill in simulating changes in climate since 1850 (see 
  Section 8.6.1), but these changes are fairly small compared with many projections 
  of climate change into the 21st century. An important motivation for attempting 
  to simulate the climatic conditions of the past is that such experiments provide 
  opportunities for evaluating how models respond to large changes in forcing. 
  Following the pioneering work of the Co-operative Holocene Mapping Project (COHMAP-Members, 
  1988), the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) (Joussaume and 
  Taylor, 1995; PMIP, 2000) has fostered the more systematic evaluation of climate 
  models under conditions during the relatively well-documented past 20,000 years. 
  The mid-Holocene (6,000 years BP) was chosen to test the response of climate 
  models to orbital forcing with CO<sub>2</sub> at pre-industrial concentration and present 
  ice sheets. The orbital configuration intensifies (weakens) the seasonal distribution 
  of the incoming solar radiation in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere, by about 
  5% (e.g., 20 Wm<sup>-2</sup> in the boreal summer). The last glacial maximum (21,000 years 
  BP) was chosen to test the response to extreme cold conditions</p>
<h4><a name="8551"></a>8.5.5.1 Mid-Holocene</h4>
<p><i>Atmosphere alone simulations</i><br>
  Within PMIP, eighteen different atmospheric general circulation models using 
  different resolutions and parametrizations have been run under the same mid-Holocene 
  conditions, assuming present-day conditions over the oceans (Joussaume et al., 
  1999). In summer, all of the models simulate an increase and northward expansion 
  of the African monsoon; conditions warmer than present in high northern latitudes, 
  and drier than present in the interior of the northern continents. Palaeo-data 
  do not support drying in interior Eurasia (Harrison et al., 1996; Yu and Harrison, 
  1996; Tarasov et al., 1998), but they clearly show an expanded monsoon in northern 
  Africa (Street-Perrott and Perrott 1993; Hoelzmann et al., 1998; Jolly et al., 
  1998a, 1998b), warming in the Arctic (Texier et al., 1997), and drying in interior 
  North America (Webb et al., 1993).<br>
  Vegetation changes reconstructed from pollen data in the BIOME 6000 project 
  (Jolly et al., 1998b; Prentice and Webb III, 1998) provide a quantitative model-data 
  comparison in northern Africa. The PMIP simulations produce a northward displacement 
  of the desert-steppe transition, qualitatively consistent with biomes, but strongly 
  underestimated in extent (Harrison et al., 1998). At least an additional 100 
  mm/yr of precipitation would be required for most models to sustain grassland 
  at 23&deg;N, i.e., more than twice as much as simulated in this area (Joussaume 
  et al., 1999) (<a href="#fig813">Figure 8.13</a>). The increased area of lakes 
  in the Sahara has also been quantified (Hoelzmann et al., 1998) and, although 
  the PMIP simulations do produce an increase, this latter is not large enough 
  (Coe and Harrison, 2000). A similar underestimation is obtained at high latitudes 
  over northern Eurasia, where PMIP simulations produce a northward shift of the 
  Arctic tree-line in agreement with observed shifts (Tarasov et al., 1998) but 
  strongly underestimated in extent (Kutzbach et al., 1996b; Texier et al., 1997; 
  Harrison et al., 1998). Model-data discrepancies may, however, be due to missing 
  feedbacks in the simplified PMIP experimental design. </p>
<p><i>Ocean feedbacks</i><br>
  Recent experiments with asynchronous (Kutzbach and Liu 1997; Liu et al., 1999) 
  and synchronous (Hewitt and Mitchell, 1998; Braconnot et al., 2000) coupling 
  of atmospheric models to full dynamical ocean models have been performed for 
  the mid-Holocene. They all produce a larger enhancement of the African monsoon 
  than shown in their PMIP atmosphere only experiments, resulting from the ocean 
  thermal inertia and changes in the meridional ocean heat transport (Braconnot 
  et al., 2000). However, the changes are not sufficient to reproduce the observed 
  changes in biome shifts over northern Africa. <br>
  Coupled models are also beginning to address the issue of changes in interannual 
  to inter-decadal variability under conditions of large differences in the basic 
  climate. Some palaeo-environmental evidence has suggested that short-term climate 
  variability associated with El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was reduced 
  during the early to mid-Holocene (Sandweiss et al., 1996; Rodbell, 1999). Up 
  to now, ENSO variability has only been analysed in the CSM simulation, exhibiting 
  no significant change at the mid-Holocene (Otto-Bliesner, 1999).</p>
<p><i>Land-surface feedbacks</i><br>
  Land-surface changes also provide an additional important feedback. During the 
  mid-Holocene, vegetation changes over northern Africa have indeed favoured a 
  larger increase in monsoon precipitation as shown through sensitivity experiments 
  (Kutzbach et al., 1996a; Brostrom et al., 1998; Texier et al., 2000) as well 
  as through coupled atmosphere-vegetation experiments (Claussen and Gayler, 1997; 
  Texier et al., 1997; Pollard et al., 1998; Doherty et al., 2000; de Noblet et 
  al., 2000). Including the observed occurrence of large lakes and wetlands (Coe 
  and Bonan, 1997; Brostrom et al., 1998) also intensifies monsoon rains. Vegetation 
  feedbacks also amplify the effects of orbital forcing at high latitudes where 
  they led to greater and more realistic shifts of vegetation cover over northern 
  Eurasia (Foley et al., 1994; Kutzbach et al., 1996b; Texier et al., 1997). The 
  importance of land-surface feedbacks has further been emphasised in the IPSL 
  AOGCM coupled to a vegetation model (Braconnot et al., 1999). The IPSL simulation 
  shows that combined feedbacks between land and ocean lead to a closer agreement 
  with palaeo-data (<a href="#fig813">Figure 8.13</a>). The ocean feedback increases 
  the supply of water vapour, while the vegetation feedback increases local moisture 
  recycling and the length of the monsoon season. The importance of land-surface 
  feedbacks has also been shown by an EMIC (Ganopolski et al., 1998a), further 
  emphasising that vegetation feedbacks may explain abrupt changes in Saharan 
  vegetation in the mid-Holocene (Claussen et al., 1999).</p>
