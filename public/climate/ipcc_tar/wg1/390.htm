<h3>10.5.1 Simulations of Current Climate </h3>
<p>Simulations of current climate conditions serve to evaluate the performance 
  of RCMs. Since the SAR, a vast number of such simulations have been conducted 
  (McGregor, 1997; <a href="403.htm">Appendices 10.1</a> to <a href="405.htm">10.3</a>). 
  These fall into two categories, RCMs driven by observed (or "perfect") 
  boundary conditions and RCMs driven by GCM boundary conditions. Observed boundary 
  conditions are derived from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) analyses (e.g., 
  European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) reanalysis, Gibson 
  et al. 1997; or National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis, 
  Kalnay et al., 1996). Over most regions they give accurate representation of 
  the large-scale flow and tropospheric temperature structure (Gibson et al., 
  1997), although errors are still present due to poor data coverage and to observational 
  uncertainty. The analyses may be used to drive RCM simulations for short periods, 
  for comparison with individual episodes, or over long periods to allow statistical 
  evaluation of the model climatology. Comparison with climatologies is the only 
  available evaluation tool for RCMs driven by GCM fields, with the caveats applied 
  to GCM validation concerning the influence of sample size and decadal variability 
  (see <a href="378.htm">Sections 10.2</a>, <a href="382.htm">10.3</a>, and <a href="387.htm">10.4</a>). 
  Despite these, relatively short simulations (several years) can identify major 
  systematic RCM biases if they yield departures from observations significantly 
  greater than the observed natural variability (Machenhauer et al., 1996, 1998; 
  Christensen et al., 1997; Jones et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Often a serious problem in RCM evaluation is the lack of good quality high-resolution 
  observed data. In many regions, observations are extremely sparse or not readily 
  available. In addition, only little work has been carried out on how to use 
  point measurements to evaluate the grid-box mean values from a climate model, 
  especially when using sparse station networks or stations in complex topographical 
  terrain (e.g., Osborn and Hulme, 1997). Most of the observational data available 
  at typical RCM resolution (order of 50 km) is for precipitation and daily minimum 
  and maximum temperature. While these fields have been shown to be useful for 
  evaluating model performance, they are also the end product of a series of complex 
  processes, so that the evaluation of individual model dynamical and physical 
  processes is necessarily limited. Additional fields need to be examined in model 
  evaluation to broaden the perspective on model performance and to help delineate 
  sources of model error. Examples are the surface energy and water fluxes.</p>
<p>Despite these problems, the situation is steadily improving in terms of grid-cell 
  climatologies (Daly et al., 1994; New et al., 1999, 2000; Widman and Bretherton, 
  2000), with various groups developing high-resolution regional climatologies 
  (e.g., Christensen et al., 1998; Frei and Sch&auml;r, 1998). In addition, regional 
  programs such as the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Continental-Scale 
  International Program (GCIP) have been designed with the purpose of developing 
  sets of observation databases at the regional scale for model evaluation (GCIP, 
  1998).</p>
<h4><a name="10511"></a>10.5.1.1 Mean climate: Simulations using analyses of observations</h4>
<p>Ideally, experiments using analyses of observations to drive the RCMs should 
  precede any attempt to simulate climate change. The model behaviour, with realistic 
  forcing, should be as close as possible to that of the real atmosphere and experiments 
  driven by analyses of observations can reveal systematic model biases primarily 
  due to the internal model dynamics and physics.</p>
<p>A list of published RCM simulations driven by analyses of observations is given 
  in <a href="403.htm">Appendix 10.1</a>. Many of these studies present regional 
  differences (or biases) of seasonally or monthly-averaged surface air temperature 
  and precipitation from observed values. They indicate that current RCMs can 
  reproduce average observations over regions of size 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> 
  km<sup>2</sup> with errors generally below 2&deg;C and within 5 to 50% of observed 
  precipitation, respectively (Giorgi and Shields, 1999; Small et al., 1999a,b; 
  van Lipzig, 1999; Pan et al., 2000). Uncertainties in the analysis fields, used 
  to drive the models, and, in the observed station data sets, should be considered 
  in the interpretation of these biases.</p>
<p>Various RCM intercomparison studies have been carried out to identify different 
  or common model strengths and weaknesses, over Europe by Christensen et al. 
  (1997), over the USA by Takle et al. (1999), and over East Asia by Leung et 
  al. (1999a). For Europe a wide range of performance was reported, with the better 
  models exhibiting a good simulation of surface air temperature (sub-regional 
  monthly bias in the range &plusmn;2&deg;C), except over south-eastern Europe 
  during summer. For the USA, a major finding was that the model ability to simulate 
  precipitation episodes varied depending on the scale of the relevant dynamical 
  forcing. Organised synoptic-scale precipitation systems were well simulated 
  deterministically, while episodes of mesoscale and convective precipitation 
  were represented in a more stochastic sense, with less degree of agreement with 
  the observed events and among models. Over East Asia, a major factor in determining 
  the model performance was found to be the simulation of cloud radiative processes.</p>
