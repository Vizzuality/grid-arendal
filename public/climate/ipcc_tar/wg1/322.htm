<h3>8.5.4 Land Surface Component (including the Terrestrial Cryosphere) </h3>
<h4><a name="8541"></a>8.5.4.1 Introduction</h4>
<p>The role of the land surface (soil, vegetation, snow, permafrost and land ice) 
  was discussed in detail in the SAR. The SAR noted that improvements had occurred 
  in our ability to model land-surface processes but that there was a wide disparity 
  among current land-surface schemes when forced by observed meteorology. Our 
  physical understanding of the role of land-surface processes within the climate 
  system was discussed in <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="289.htm#741">Section 
  7.4.1</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="8542"></a>8.5.4.2 Developments since the SAR </h4>
<p>Most of the effort in trying to reduce the disparity in land-surface scheme 
  performance has been performed in offline intercomparisons under the auspices 
  of International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and the World Climate 
  Research Programme (WCRP). Due to the difficulties in coupling multiple land-surface 
  schemes into climate models (see <a href="323.htm">Section 8.5.4.3</a>) specific 
  endeavours have been: the Project for the Intercomparison of Land-surface Parametrization 
  Schemes (PILPS), the Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP), the International Satellite 
  Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP), and the Biological Aspects of the 
  Hydrological Cycle (BAHC) (e.g., Henderson-Sellers et al., 1995; Polcher et 
  al., 1996; Dirmeyer et al., 1999; Schlosser et al., 2000). In comparisons between 
  offline simulation results and observations, difficulties in partitioning available 
  energy between sensible and latent heat and partitioning of available water 
  between evaporation and runoff were highlighted (e.g., Chen et al., 1997; Schlosser 
  et al., 2000). While we are far from a complete understanding of why land surface 
  models differ by such a large degree, some progress has been made (e.g., Koster 
  and Milly, 1997; Desborough, 1999). Significant progress has also been made 
  in adding physical processes into land-surface models (see <a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>, <a href="289.htm">Section 7.4</a>). Where some observations exist (e.g., 
  for incoming solar radiation, net radiation and soil moisture), an evaluation 
  of the ability of current climate models to simulate these quantities suggests 
  that significant problems remain (Wild et al., 1997; Garratt et al., 1998; Robock 
  et al., 1998). The evaluation of surface processes in climate models tends to 
  focus on monthly and, less commonly, daily quantities. An evaluation of the 
  ability of climate models to simulate land-surface quantities at the diurnal 
  scale has yet to be performed systematically, although some efforts have been 
  initiated since the SAR (e.g., Watterson, 1997).</p>

<p><a name="fig811"></a>Work since the SAR has also focused on trying to identify 
  the relative significance of land-surface processes in comparison with other 
  components of climate models. The sophistication in the representation of the 
  land surface in coupled models is varied (see <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a> 
  and <a href="316.htm#tab81">Table 8.1</a>). The addition of more realistic plant 
  physiology in some land-surface models (e.g., Bonan, 1995; Sellers et al., 1996 
  (See <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="289.htm">Section 7.4</a>)) which 
  permits the simulation of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and gas isotope fluxes, provides 
  the opportunity to compare these quantities with local scale, regional scale 
  and global scale observations from flux towers and satellites.</p>
<p>Snow, and the snow albedo feedback, are important components of the land surface. 
  Current climate models incorporate snow in varying degrees of sophistication 
  and there is currently major uncertainty in the ability of land-surface schemes 
  to simulate snow mass or cover (see <a href="260.htm">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="293.htm">Section 
  7.5</a>). Frei and Robinson (1998) evaluated the simulation of monthly mean 
  snow extent from 27 AMIP AGCMs and found weaknesses in the simulation of the 
  seasonal cycle of snow extent and a general underestimation in interannual variability. 
  These weaknesses limit confidence in the simulation of mid- and high latitude 
  changes simulated by current climate models, since a failure to simulate snow 
  accurately tends to impact significantly on albedo, surface roughness length 
  and soil moisture (and therefore precipitation on subsequent seasons).</p>
<p>The Northern Hemisphere snow simulations of fourteen global coupled models 
  contributed to CMIP are summarised in <a href="#fig811">Figure 8.11</a> and 
  <a href="321.htm#tab83">Table 8.3</a>. <a href="#fig811">Figure 8.11</a> (constructed 
  similarly to <a href="321.htm#fig810">Figure 8.10</a>) provides a visual presentation 
  of the range in simulated (land only) snow extent. The relative error in simulated 
  snow extent is larger in summer than in winter. There is no obvious connection 
  between either flux adjustment or land-surface scheme and the quality of the 
  simulated snow extent.</p>
<p>Other components of the land surface potentially important to climate change 
  include lateral water flows from the continents into the ocean, permafrost, 
  land-based ice and ice sheets. Some land-surface schemes now include river routing 
  (e.g., Sausen et al., 1994; Hagemann and D&uuml;menil, 1998) in order to simulate 
  the annual cycle of river discharge into the ocean. This appears to improve 
  the modelling of runoff from some large drainage basins (D&uuml;menil et al., 
  1997), although water storage and runoff in regions of frozen soil moisture 
  remain outstanding problems (Arpe et al., 1997; Pitman et al., 1999). River 
  routing is also useful in diagnosing the representation of the hydrological 
  cycle in models (e.g., Kattsov et al., 2000). There has been limited progress 
  towards developing a permafrost model for use in climate models (e.g., Malevsky-Malevich 
  et al., 1999) although existing simple models appear to approximate the observed 
  range in permafrost reasonably well (e.g., Volodin and Lykosov, 1998). The dynamics 
  of ice sheets and calving are not presently represented in coupled climate models. 
  To close the fresh water budget for the coupled system, fresh water which accumulates 
  on Greenland and Antarctica is usually uniformly distributed either over the 
  entire ocean or just in the vicinity of the ice sheets (e.g., Legutke and Voss, 
  1999; Gordon et al., 2000). The impact of these limitations has yet to be investigated.</p>
