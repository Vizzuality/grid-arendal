<h3>5.3.4 Determination of Cloud Droplet Number Concentration</h3>

<p><a name="fig57"></a>The impact of CCN on the cloud droplet number concentration 
  (N<sub>d</sub>) can be non-linear. One consequence of this is that the number 
  of natural CCN can strongly influence the way that CCN from anthropogenic emissions 
  affect the indirect radiative forcing. For example, Ghan et al. (1998) have 
  shown that the presence of relatively high concentrations of sea salt particles 
  can lead to increased N<sub>d</sub> at lower sulphate concentrations and higher 
  updraught speeds. Conversely, the N<sub>d</sub> are lowered by high salt concentrations 
  if sulphate concentrations are higher and updraught speeds are weaker (see also 
  O'Dowd et al. (1999)). However, it is not clear whether these processes 
  significantly affect the radiative forcing.<br>
</p>
<p> There are two general methods that have been used to relate changes in N<sub>d</sub> 
  to changes in aerosol concentrations. The first and simplest approach uses an 
  empirical relationship that directly connects some aerosol quantity to N<sub>d</sub>. 
  Two such empirical treatments have been derived. Jones et al. (1994b) used a 
  relationship between N<sub>d</sub> and the number concentration of aerosol particles 
  (N<sub>a</sub>) above a certain size. This method is appropriate for the particles 
  that serve as nuclei for cloud droplets in stratiform cloud, but it can be ambiguous 
  for cumuliform cloud because of the activation of particles smaller than the 
  threshold of the N<sub>a</sub> (Isaac et al., 1990; Gillani et al., 1995). Boucher 
  and Lohmann (1995) used observations of N<sub>d</sub> and of CCN versus particulate 
  or cloudwater sulphate to devise relationships between N<sub>d</sub> and particulate 
  sulphate. This approach has the advantage that it circumvents the assumptions 
  required in deriving the aerosol number concentration N<sub>a</sub> from sulphate 
  mass. The use of sulphate as a surrogate for N<sub>d</sub> implicitly accounts 
  for other particulate species in the aerosol, but only as long as relationships 
  are used that take into account the potential regional and seasonal differences 
  in the chemical mixture of the aerosol (e.g., Van Dingenen et al., 1995; Menon 
  and Saxena, 1998). Thus, the empirical relationships derived for regions with 
  high industrial sulphate loading may not be appropriate for biomass aerosols. 
  A new empirical approach relates N<sub>d</sub> to the particle mass concentration 
  and mean volume diameter in the accumulation mode aerosol. It is based on mass 
  scavenging efficiencies of the accumulation-mode aerosol by stratiform clouds 
  (Glantz and Noone, 2000). When deriving empirical relationships, it is important 
  to be aware of the effects of the averaging scale (Gultepe and Isaac, 1998). 
  An advantage of the empirical methods is that they may account for the effects 
  on N<sub>d</sub> that are associated with cloud dynamics in an average sense. 
  Variance in the cloud updraught velocities is one of the main reasons for the 
  large scatter in the observations from which these empirical relationships are 
  derived (Leaitch et al., 1996b; Feingold et al., 1999b).<br>
</p>
<p>The second method that has been used to relate changes inN<sub>d</sub>to changes 
  in aerosol concentrations is based on a prognostic parametrization of the cloud 
  droplet formation process (Ghan et al., 1993, 1995, 1997; Chuang and Penner, 
  1995; Abdul-Razzak et al., 1998; Abdul-Razzak and Ghan, 2000). This type of 
  approach requires a representation of the CCN activity of the particles and 
  a representation of the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the cloud. At 
  present, some of the aerosol properties necessary to describe the CCN spectrum 
  must be assumed in order to apply this approach.</p>
<p>A comparison of the empirical and prognostic methods currently in use for determining 
  the N<sub>d</sub> is shown in <a href="#fig57">Figure 5.7</a>. The empirical 
  relationships are taken from Jones et al. (1994b) and Boucher and Lohmann (1995) 
  and represent stratiform cloud. The curves labelled PROG follow the prognostic 
  parametrization used by Chuang and Penner (1995). There is some relative general 
  agreement between the empirical curves and the prognostic curves for low updraught 
  velocity. The prognostic curves for the higher updraught velocity, i.e. more 
  convective cloud, give much higher N<sub>d</sub> than the empirical results 
  for stratiform cloud. The relatively close agreement of the 10 cms<sup>-1</sup> 
  updraught curve with the empirical scheme for the ocean is somewhat fortuitous. 
  Further work comparing both the empirical and prognostic schemes with observations 
  is needed, especially for the climatologically important marine stratocumulus, 
  to better understand the reasons for the agreements and differences in <a href="#fig57">Figure 
  5.7</a>.<br>
</p>
<p> There are also atmospheric dynamic factors that affect the prediction of N<sub>d</sub>. 
  Trajectories of air parcels through strato-cumulus are highly variable (e.g., 
  Feingold et al., 1998). For the prognostic methods with their explicit representation 
  of the updraught velocity, there is a need to understand not just the probability 
  distribution function (PDF) of updraughts in these clouds, but the PDF of those 
  that actually nucleate droplets. No satisfactory method of parametrizing the 
  local updraught has yet been devised. The prognostic methods also produce an 
  adiabatic N<sub>d</sub>, which leads to the problem of how to represent the 
  mean N<sub>d</sub> in the cloud in the presence of the entrainment of dry air. 
  Entrainment can even result from changes in N<sub>d</sub> (Boers and Mitchell, 
  1994). These issues are critical for the prognostic prediction of N<sub>d</sub> 
  and deserve continued study to determine how best to take their effects into 
  account.</p>
