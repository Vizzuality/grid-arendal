      from Northern Europe: Amsterdam, Netherlands; Brest, France; Sheerness,

      to first order the contribution of postglacial rebound); Swinoujscie, Poland 
      (formerly Swinemunde, Germany); and Liverpool, UK. Data for the latter are 
      of "Adjusted Mean High Water" rather than Mean Sea Level and include

<p><a name="fig117"></a>The geological evidence for the past 10,000 to 20,000 
  years indicates that major temporal and spatial variation occurs in relative 
  sea level change (e.g., Pirazzoli, 1991) on time-scales of the order of a few 
  thousand years (<a href="419.htm#fig115">Figure 11.5</a>). The change observed 
  at locations near the former centres of glaciation is primarily the result of 
  the glacio-isostatic effect, whereas the change observed at tectonically stable 
  localities far from the former ice sheets approximate the global average sea 
  level change (for geologically recent times this is primarily eustatic change 
  relating to changes in land-based ice volume). Glacio-hydro-isostatic effects 
  (the Earth's response to the past changes in ice and water loads) remain 
  important and result in a spatial variability in sea level over the past 6,000 
  years for localities far from the former ice margins. Analysis of data from 
  such sites indicate that the ocean volume may have increased to add 2.5 to 3.5 
  m to global average sea level over the past 6,000 years (e.g., Fleming et al., 
  1998), with a decreasing contribution in the last few thousand years. If this 
  occurred uniformly over the past 6,000 years it would raise sea level by 0.4 
  to 0.6 mm/year. However, a few high resolution sea level records from the French 
  Mediterranean coast indicate that much of this increase occurred between about 
  6,000 and 3,000 years ago and that the rate over the past 3,000 years was only 
  about 0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr (Lambeck and Bard, 2000). These inferences do not constrain 
  the source of the added water but likely sources are the Antarctic and Greenland 
  ice sheets with possible contributions from glaciers and thermal expansion. 
</p>
<p>In these analyses of Late Holocene observations, the relative sea level change 
  is attributed to both a contribution from any change in ocean volume and a contribution 
  from the glacio-hydro-isostatic effect, where the former is a function of time 
  only and the latter is a function of both time and position. It is possible 
  to use the record of sea level changes to estimate parameters for a model of 
  isostatic rebound. In doing this, the spatial variability of sea level change 
  determines the mantle rheology, whereas the time dependence determines any correction 
  that may be required to the assumed history of volume change. Solutions from 
  different geographic regions may lead to variations in the rheology due to lateral 
  variations in mantle temperature, for example, but the eustatic term should 
  be the same, within observational and model uncertainties, in each case (Nakada 
  and Lambeck, 1988). If it is assumed that no eustatic change has occurred in 
  the past 6,000 years or so, but in fact eustatic change actually has occurred, 
  the solution for Earth-model parameters will require a somewhat stiffer mantle 
  than a solution in which eustatic change is included. The two solutions may, 
  however, be equally satisfactory for interpolating between observations. For 
  example, both approaches lead to mid-Holocene highstands at island and continental 
  margin sites far from the former ice sheets of amplitudes 1 to 3 m. The occurrence 
  of such sea level maxima places a upper limit on the magnitude of glacial melt 
  in recent millennia (e.g., Peltier, 2000), but it would be inconsistent to combine 
  estimates of ongoing glacial melt with results of calculations of isostatic 
  rebound in which the rheological parameters have been inferred assuming there 
  is no ongoing melt.</p>
<p>The geological indicators of past sea level are usually not sufficiently precise 
  to enable fluctuations of sub-metre amplitude to be observed. In some circumstances 
  high quality records do exist. These are from tectonically stable areas where 
  the tidal range is small and has remained little changed through time, where 
  no barriers or other shoreline features formed to change the local conditions, 
  and where there are biological indicators that bear a precise and consistent 
  relationship to sea level. Such areas include the micro-atoll coral formations 
  of Queensland, Australia (Chappell, 1982; Woodroffe and McLean, 1990); the coralline 
  algae and gastropod vermetid data of the Mediterranean (Laborel et al., 1994; 
  Morhange et al., 1996), and the fresh-to-marine transitions in the Baltic Sea 
  (Eronen et al., 1995; Hyvarinen, 1999). These results all indicate that for 
  the past 3,000 to 5,000 years oscillations in global sea level on time-scales 
  of 100 to 1,000 years are unlikely to have exceeded 0.3 to 0.5 m. Archaeological 
  evidence for this interval places similar constraints on sea level oscillations 
  (Flemming and Webb, 1986). Some detailed local studies have indicated that fluctuations 
  of the order of 1 m can occur (e.g., Van de Plassche et al., 1998) but no globally 
  consistent pattern has yet emerged, suggesting that these may be local rather 
  than global variations. </p>
<p>Estimates of current ice sheet mass balance (<a href="416.htm#11231">Section 
  11.2.3.1</a>) have improved since the SAR. However, these results indicate only 
  that the ice sheets are not far from balance. Earth rotational constraints (<a href="420.htm#11242">Section 
  11.2.4.2</a>) and ice sheet altimetry (<a href="416.htm#11232">Section 11.2.3.2</a>) 
  offer the prospect of resolving the ice sheet mass balance in the future, but 
  at present the most accurate estimates of the long-term imbalance (period of 
  several hundred years) follows from the comparison of the geological sea level 
  data with the ice sheet modelling results (<a href="417.htm">Section 11.2.3.3</a>). 
  The above geological estimates of the recent sea level rates may include a component 
  from thermal expansion and glacier mass changes which, from the long-term temperature 
  record in <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a> (<a href="067.htm#232">Section 2.3.2</a>), 
  could contribute to a sea level lowering by as much as 0.1 mm/yr. These results 
  suggest that the combined long-term ice sheet imbalance lies within the range 
  0.1 to 0.3 mm/yr. Results from ice sheet models for the last 500 years indicate 
  an ongoing adjustment to the glacial-interglacial transition of Greenland and 
  Antarctica together of 0.0 to 0.5 mm/yr. These ranges are consistent. We therefore 
  take the ongoing contribution of the ice sheets to sea level rise in the 20th 
  and 21st centuries in response to earlier climate change as 0.0 to 0.5 mm/yr. 
  This is additional to the effect of 20th century and future climate change.</p>
