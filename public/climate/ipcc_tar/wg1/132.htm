<h3>4.1.3 Trace Gas Budgets and Trends<br>
</h3>
<p>The "budget" of a trace gas consists of three quantities: its global 
  source, global sink and atmospheric burden. The burden is defined as the total 
  mass of the gas integrated over the atmosphere and related reservoirs, which 
  usually include just the troposphere and stratosphere. The global burden (in 
  Tg) and its trend (i.e., the difference between sources and sinks, in Tg/yr) 
  can be determined from atmospheric measurements and, for the long-lived gases, 
  are usually the best-known quantities in the budgets. For short-lived, highly 
  variable gases such as tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>, the atmospheric 
  burden cannot be measured with great accuracy. The global source strength is 
  the sum of all sources, including emissions and in situ chemical production. 
  Likewise, the sink strength (or global loss rate) can have several independent 
  components. </p>
<p>The source strength (Tg/yr) for most greenhouse gases is comprised of surface 
  emissions. For synthetic gases where industrial production and emissions are 
  well documented, the source strengths may be accurately known. For CH<sub>4</sub> 
  and N<sub>2</sub>O, however, there are large, not well-quantified, natural emissions. 
  Further, the anthropogenic emissions of these gases are primarily associated 
  with agricultural sources that are difficult to quantify accurately. Considerable 
  research has gone into identifying and quantifying the emissions from individual 
  sources for CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, as discussed below. Such uncertainty 
  in source strength also holds for synthetic gases with undocumented emissions. 
  The source strength for tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> includes both a stratospheric 
  influx and in situ production and is thus derived primarily from global chemical 
  models.</p>
<p>The sink strength (Tg/yr) of long-lived greenhouse gases can be derived from 
  a combination of atmospheric observations, laboratory experiments, and models. 
  The atmospheric chemistry models are based on physical principles and laboratory 
  data, and include as constraints the observed chemistry of the atmosphere over 
  the past two decades. For example, stratospheric loss rates are derived from 
  models either by combining observed trace gas distributions with theoretically 
  calculated loss frequencies or from the measured correlation of the respective 
  gas with a trace gas of known vertical flux. In such analyses there are a wide 
  range of self-consistency checks. Mean global loss rates based on a priori modelling 
  (e.g., the CH<sub>4</sub>-lifetime studies from OxComp described later) can 
  be compared with empirically-based loss rates that are scaled from a gas with 
  similar loss processes that has well-known emissions and atmospheric burden 
  (e.g., the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) calibration 
  of mean tropospheric OH using methyl chloroform (CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub>); 
  Prinn et al., 1995). Our knowledge of the current budget of a greenhouse gas 
  provides a key constraint in modelling its future abundance. For example, in 
  both the IS92a and SRES projected emissions of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, 
  we apply a constant offset to each set of emissions so that our calculated burden 
  is consistent with the observed budget and trend during the 1990s.</p>
