<h4>10.6.3.2 Evaluation</h4>
<p>The evaluation of downscaling techniques is essential but problematic. It requires 
  that the validity of the downscaling functions under future climates be demonstrated, 
  and that the predictors represent the climate change signal. It is not possible 
  to achieve this rigorously as the empirical knowledge available is insufficient. 
  The analysis of historical developments, e.g., by comparing downscaling models 
  between recent and historical periods (Jacobeit et al., 1998), as well as simulations 
  with GCMs can provide support for these assumptions. However, the success of 
  a statistical downscaling technique for representing present day conditions 
  does not necessarily imply that it would give skilful results under changed 
  climate conditions, and may need independent confirmation from climate model 
  simulations (Charles et al., 1999b).</p>
<p>The classical validation approach is to specify the downscaling technique from 
  a segment of available observational evidence and then assess the performance 
  of the empirical model by comparing its predictions with independent observed 
  values. This approach is particularly valuable when the observational record 
  is long and documents significant changes (greater than 50 years in some cases; 
  Hanssen-Bauer and F&oslash;rland (1998, 2000)). An example is the analysis of 
  absolute pressure tendencies in the North Atlantic (Kaas et al., 1996). As another 
  example, Wilks (1999b) developed a downscaling function on dry years and found 
  it functioned well in wet years.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to use a series of comparisons between models and 
  transfer functions (e.g., Gonz&aacute;lez-Rouco et al., 1999, 2000). For instance, 
  empirically derived links were shown to be incorporated in a GCM (Busuioc et 
  al., 1999) and a RCM (Charles et al., 1999b). Then a climatic change due to 
  doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> was estimated through the empirical link and compared 
  with the result of the dynamical models. In both cases, the dynamical response 
  was found consistent for the winter season, indicating the validity of the empirical 
  approach, although less robust results were noted in the other seasons. </p>
<h4><a name="10633"></a>10.6.3.3 Choice of predictors</h4>
<p>There is little systematic work explicitly evaluating the relative skill of 
  different atmospheric predictors (Winkler et al., 1997). This is despite the 
  availability of disparate studies that evaluate a broad range of predictors, 
  predictands and techniques (see <a href="406.htm">Appendix 10.4</a>). Useful 
  summaries of downscaling techniques and the predictors used are also presented 
  in Rummukainen (1997), Wilby (1998), and Wilby and Wigley (2000).</p>
<p>The choice of the predictor variables is of utmost importance. For example, 
  Hewitson and Crane (1996) and Hewitson (1999) have demonstrated how the down-scaled 
  projection of future change in mean precipitation and extreme events may alter 
  significantly depending on whether or not humidity is included as a predictor. 
  The downscaled results can also depend on whether absolute or relative humidity 
  is used as a predictor (Charles et al., 1999b). The implication here is that 
  while a predictor may or may not appear as the most significant when developing 
  the downscaling function under present climates, the changes in that predictor 
  under a future climate may be critical for determining the climate change. Some 
  estimation procedures, for example stepwise regression, are not able to recognise 
  this and exclude variables that may be vital for climate change.</p>
<p>A similar issue exists with respect to downscaling temperature. Werner and 
  von Storch (1993), Hanssen-Bauer and F&oslash;rland (2000) and Mietus (1999) 
  noted that low-frequency changes in local temperature during the 20th century 
  could only partly be related to changes in circulation. Schubert (1998) makes 
  a vital point in noting that changes of local temperature under doubled atmospheric 
  CO<sub>2</sub> may be dominated by changes in the radiative properties of the 
  atmosphere rather than circulation changes. These can be accounted for by incorporating 
  the large-scale temperature field from the GCM as a surrogate indicator of the 
  changed radiative properties of the atmosphere (Dehn and Buma, 1999) or by using 
  several large-scale predictors, such as gridded temperature and circulation 
  fields (e.g., Gyalistras et al., 1998; Huth, 1999).</p>
<p>With the recent availability of global reanalyses (Kalnay et al., 1996; Gibson 
  et al., 1997), the number of candidate predictor fields has been greatly enhanced 
  (Solman and Nu&ntilde;ez, 1999). Prior to this the empirical evidence about 
  the co-variability of regional/local predictands and large-scale predictors 
  was limited mostly to gridded near surface temperature and/or air pressure. 
  These "new" data sets allow significant improvements in the design 
  of empirical downscaling techniques, in particular by incorporating knowledge 
  about detailed meteorological processes. Taking advantage of these new data 
  sets have allowed systematic evaluation of a broad range of possible predictors 
  for daily precipitation. It has been found that indicators of mid-tropospheric 
  circulation and humidity to be the most critical predictors, with surface flow 
  and humidity information being important under orographic rainfall.</p>
