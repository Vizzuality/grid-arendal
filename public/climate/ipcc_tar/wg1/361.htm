<h4>9.3.5.2 Interannual variability ENSO</h4>
<p>ENSO is associated with some of the most pronounced year-to-year variability 
  in climate features in many parts of the world (<a href="048.htm">Chapters 2</a> 
  and <a href="260.htm">7</a>). Since global climate models simulate some aspects 
  of ENSO-like phenomena (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>), there have been a 
  number of studies that have attempted to use climate models to assess the changes 
  that might occur in ENSO in connection with future climate warming and in particular, 
  those aspects of ENSO that may affect future climate extremes. </p>
<p>Firstly, will the long-term mean Pacific SSTs shift toward a more El Ni&ntilde;o-like 
  or La Ni&ntilde;a-like regime? Since 1995, the analyses of several global climate 
  models indicate that as global temperatures increase due to increased greenhouse 
  gases, the Pacific climate will tend to resemble a more El Ni&ntilde;o-like 
  state (Knutson and Manabe, 1995; Mitchell et al., 1995; Meehl and Washington, 
  1996; Timmermann et al., 1999; Boer et al., 2000b). However, the reasons for 
  such a response are varied, and could depend on the model representation of 
  cloud feedback (Senior, 1999; Meehl et al., 2000b); the quality of the unperturbed 
  El Ni&ntilde;o state in the models (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>) or the 
  stronger evaporative damping of the warming in the warm pool region, relative 
  to the eastern Pacific due to the non-linear Clausius-Clapeyron relationship 
  between temperature and saturation mixing ratios (e.g., Knutson and Manabe, 
  1995). Additionally, a different coupled model (Noda et al., 1999b) shows a 
  La Ni&ntilde;a-like response and yet another model shows an initial La Ni&ntilde;a-like 
  pattern which becomes an El Ni&ntilde;o-like pattern due to subducted warmed 
  extra-tropical water that penetrates through the sub-tropics into the tropics 
  (Cai and Whetton, 2000). A possible reason for the La Ni&ntilde;a-like response 
  has been suggested in a simple coupled model study where the dominant role of 
  ocean dynamics in the heat balance over the tropical Pacific is seen for a specified 
  uniform positive forcing across the Pacific basin (Cane et al., 1997). </p>

      (green line). Minimum and maximum standard deviations derived from the control

      Timmermann et al., 1999), (b) HadCM3 (Collins, 2000b). </td>

<p><a name="fig926"></a>Secondly, will El Ni&ntilde;o variability (the amplitude 
  and/or the frequency of temperature swings in the equatorial Pacific) increase 
  or decrease? Attempts to address this question using climate models have again 
  shown conflicting results, varying from slight decreases or little change in 
  amplitude (Tett 1995; Knutson et al., 1997; Noda et al., 1999b; Collins, 2000b; 
  Washington et al., 2001; <a href="#fig926">Figure 9.26b</a>) to a small increase 
  in amplitude (Timmermann et al., 1999; Collins, 2000a; <a href="#fig926">Figure 
  9.26a</a>), which has been attributed to an increase in the intensity of the 
  thermocline in the tropical Pacific. Knutson et al. (1997) and Hu et al. (2001) 
  find that the largest changes in the amplitude of ENSO occur on decadal time-scales 
  with increased multi-decadal modulation of the ENSO amplitude. Several authors 
  have also found changes in other statistics of variability related to ENSO. 
  Timmermann et al. (1999) find that the interannual variability of their model 
  becomes more skewed towards strong cold (La Ni&ntilde;a type) events relative 
  to the warmer mean climate. Collins (2000a) finds an increased frequency of 
  ENSO events and a shift in the seasonal cycle, so that the maximum occurs between 
  August and October rather than around January as in the unperturbed model and 
  the observations. Some recent coupled models have achieved a stable climate 
  without the use of flux adjustments and an important question to ask is what 
  is the effect of flux adjustment on changes in variability. Collins (2000b) 
  finds different responses in ENSO in two models, one of which has been run without 
  the use of flux-adjustments. However, he concludes that differences in response 
  are most likely to be due to differences in the response of the meridional temperature 
  gradient in the two models arising from different cloud feedbacks (Williams 
  et al., 2001) rather than due to the presence or absence of flux adjustment.</p>
<p>Finally, how will ENSO's impact on weather in the Pacific Basin and other 
  parts of the world change? Meehl et al. (1993) and Meehl and Washington (1996) 
  indicate that future seasonal precipitation extremes associated with a given 
  ENSO event are likely to be more intense due to the warmer, more El Ni&ntilde;o-like, 
  mean base state in a future climate. That is, for the tropical Pacific and Indian 
  Ocean regions, anomalously wet areas could become wetter and anomalously dry 
  areas become drier during future ENSO events. Also, in association with changes 
  in the extra-tropical base state in a future warmer climate, the teleconnections 
  to mid-latitudes, particularly over North America, may shift somewhat with an 
  associated shift of precipitation and drought conditions in future ENSO events 
  (Meehl et al., 1993). </p>
<p>When assessing changes in ENSO, it must be recognised that an "El Ni&ntilde;o-like" 
  pattern can apparently occur at a variety of time-scales ranging from interannual 
  to inter-decadal (Zhang et al., 1997), either without any change in forcing 
  or as a response to external forcings such as increased CO<sub>2</sub> (Meehl and Washington, 
  1996; Knutson and Manabe, 1998; Noda et al., 1999a,b; Boer et al., 2000b; Meehl 
  et al., 2000b). Making conclusions about "changes" in future ENSO 
  events will be complicated by these factors. Additionally, since substantial 
  internally generated variability of ENSO statistics on multi-decadal to century 
  time-scales occurs in long unforced climate model simulations (Knutson et al., 
  1997), the attribution of past and future changes in ENSO amplitude and frequency 
  to external forcing may be quite difficult, perhaps requiring extensive use 
  of ensemble climate experiments or long experiments with stabilised forcing 
  (e.g., Knutson et al., 1997). </p>
<p>Although there are now better ENSO simulations in global coupled climate models 
  (<a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>), further model improvements are needed to 
  simulate a more realistic Pacific climatology and seasonal cycle as well as 
  more realistic ENSO variability (e.g., Noda et al., 1999b). It is likely that 
  such things as increased ocean resolution, atmospheric physics and possibly 
  flux correction can have an important effect on the response of the ENSO in 
  models. Improvements in these areas will be necessary to gain further confidence 
  in climate model projections. </p>
<p><i>Monsoon</i><br>
  One of the most significant aspects of regional interannual variability is the 
  Asian Monsoon. Several recent studies (Kitoh et al., 1997; Hu et al., 2000a; 
  Lal et al., 2000) have corroborated earlier results (Mitchell et al., 1990; 
  Kattenberg et al., 1996) of an increase in the interannual variability of daily 
  precipitation in the Asian summer monsoon with increased greenhouse gases. Lal 
  et al. (2000) find that there is also an increase in intra-seasonal precipitation 
  variability and that both intra-seasonal and inter-annual increases are associated 
  with increased intra-seasonal convective activity during the summer. Less well 
  studied is the Asian winter monsoon, although Hu et al. (2000b) find reductions 
  in its intensity with a systematic weakening of the north-easterlies along the 
  Pacific coast of the Eurasian continent. However, they find no change in the 
  interannual or inter-decadal variability.</p>
<p>The effect of sulphate aerosols on Indian summer monsoon precipitation is to 
  dampen the strength of the monsoon compared to that seen with greenhouse gases 
  only (Lal et al., 1995; Cubasch et al., 1996; Meehl et al., 1996; Mitchell and 
  Johns 1997; Roeckner et al., 1999), reinforcing preliminary findings in the 
  SAR. The pattern of response to the combined forcing is at least partly dependent 
  on the land-sea distribution of the aerosol forcing, which in turn may depend 
  upon the relative size of the direct and indirect effects (e.g., Meehl et al., 
  1996; Roeckner et al., 1999). There is still considerable uncertainty in these 
  forcings (<a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>). To date, the effect of aerosol forcing 
  (direct and indirect) on the variability of the monsoon has not been investigated.</p>
<p>In summary, an intensification of the Asian summer monsoon and an enhancement 
  of summer monsoon precipitation variability with increased greenhouse gases 
  that was reported in the SAR has been corroborated by new studies. The effect 
  of sulphate aerosols is to weaken the intensification of the mean precipitation 
  found with increases in greenhouse gases, but the magnitude of the change depends 
  on the size and distribution of the forcing. </p>
