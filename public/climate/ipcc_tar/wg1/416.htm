<h3>11.2.3 Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets </h3>
<p>Together, the present Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets contain enough water 
  to raise sea level by almost 70 m (<a href="412.htm#tab113">Table 11.3</a>), 
  so that only a small fractional change in their volume would have a significant 
  effect. The average annual solid precipitation falling onto the ice sheets is 
  equivalent to 6.5 mm of sea level, this input being approximately balanced by 
  loss from melting and iceberg calving. The balance of these processes is not 
  the same for the two ice sheets, on account of their different climatic regimes. 
  Antarctic temperatures are so low that there is virtually no surface runoff; 
  the ice sheet mainly loses mass by ice discharge into floating ice shelves, 
  which experience melting and freezing at their underside and eventually break 
  up to form icebergs. On the other hand, summer temperatures on the Greenland 
  ice sheet are high enough to cause widespread melting, which accounts for about 
  half of the ice loss, the remainder being discharged as icebergs or into small 
  ice-shelves.</p>
<p>Changes in ice discharge generally involve response times of the order of 10<sup><small>2</small></sup> 
  to 10<sup><small>4</small></sup> years. The time-scales are determined by isostasy, the ratio of ice thickness 
  to yearly mass turnover, processes affecting ice viscosity, and physical and 
  thermal processes at the bed. Hence it is likely that the ice sheets are still 
  adjusting to their past history, in particular the transition to inter-glacial 
  conditions. Their future contribution to sea level change therefore has a component 
  resulting from past climate changes as well as one relating to present and future 
  climate changes. </p>
<p>For the 21st century, we expect that surface mass balance changes will dominate 
  the volume response of both ice sheets. A key question is whether ice-dynamical 
  mechanisms could operate which would enhance ice discharge sufficiently to have 
  an appreciable additional effect on sea level rise.</p>
<h4><a name="11231"></a>11.2.3.1 Mass balance studies</h4>
<p>Traditionally, the state of balance of the polar ice sheets has been assessed 
  by estimating the individual mass balance terms, and making the budget. Only 
  the mass balance of the ice sheet resting on bedrock (the grounded ice sheet) 
  needs to be considered, because changes in the ice shelves do not affect sea 
  level as they are already afloat. Recent mass balance estimates for Greenland 
  and Antarctica are shown in <a href="415.htm#tab115">Tables 11.5</a> and <a href="415.htm#tab116">11.6</a>. 
  Most progress since the SAR has been made in the assessment of accumulation, 
  where the major obstacle is poor coverage by in situ measurements. New methods 
  have made use of atmospheric moisture convergence analysis based on meteorological 
  data, remotely sensed brightness temperatures of dry snow, and GCMs (see references 
  in the tables). Recent accumulation estimates display a tendency for convergence 
  towards a common value, suggesting a remaining error of less than 10% for both 
  ice sheets.</p>
<p>For Greenland (<a href="415.htm#tab115">Table 11.5</a>), runoff is an important 
  term but net ablation has only been measured directly at a few locations and 
  therefore has to be calculated from models, which have considerable sensitivity 
  to the surface elevation data set and the parameters of the melt and refreezing 
  methods used (Reeh and Starzer, 1996; Van de Wal, 1996; Van de Wal and Ekholm, 
  1996; Janssens and Huybrechts, 2000). Summing best estimates of the various 
  mass balance components for Greenland gives a balance of -8.5 &plusmn; 
  10.2% of the input, or +0.12 &plusmn; 0.15 mm/yr of global sea level change, 
  not significantly different from zero.</p>
<p>During the last five years, some mass balance estimates have been made for 
  individual Greenland sectors. A detailed comparison of the ice flux across the 
  2,000 m contour with total accumulation revealed most of the accumulation zone 
  to be near to equilibrium, albeit with somewhat larger positive and negative 
  local imbalances (Thomas et al., 1998, 2000). These results are likely to be 
  only little influenced by short-term variations, because in the ice sheet interior, 
  quantities that determine ice flow show little variation on a century time-scale. 
  Recent studies have suggested a loss of mass in the ablation zone (Rignot et 
  al., 1997; Ohmura et al., 1999), and have brought to light the important role 
  played by bottom melting below floating glaciers (Reeh et al., 1997, 1999; Rignot 
  et al., 1997); neglect of this term led to erroneous results in earlier analyses.</p>
<p>For Antarctica (<a href="415.htm#tab116">Table 11.6</a>), the ice discharge 
  dominates the uncertainty in the mass balance of the grounded ice sheet, because 
  of the difficulty of determining the position and thickness of ice at the grounding 
  line and the need for assumptions about the vertical distribution of velocity. 
  The figure of Budd and Smith (1985) of 1,620x10<sup>12</sup> kg/yr is the only 
  available estimate. Comparing this with an average value of recent accumulation 
  estimates for the grounded ice sheet would suggest a positive mass balance of 
  around +10% of the total input, equivalent to -0.5 mm/yr of sea level. Alternatively, 
  the flux across the grounding line can be obtained by assuming the ice shelves 
  to be in balance and using estimates of the calving rate (production of icebergs), 
  the rate of melting on the (submerged) underside of the ice shelves, and accumulation 
  on the ice shelves. This results in a flux of 2,209 &plusmn; 391x10<sup><small>12</small></sup> 
  kg/yr across the grounding line and a mass balance for the grounded ice equivalent 
  to +1.04 &plusmn; 1.06 mm/yr of sea level (<a href="415.htm#tab116">Table 11.6</a>). 
  However, the ice shelves may not be in balance, so that the error estimate probably 
  understates the true uncertainty.</p>
<h4><a name="11232"></a>11.2.3.2 Direct monitoring of surface elevation changes</h4>
<p>Provided that changes in ice and snow density and bedrock elevation are small 
  or can be determined, elevation changes can be used to estimate changes of mass 
  of the ice sheets. Using satellite altimetry, Davis et al. (1998) reported a 
  small average thickening between 1978 and 1988 of 15 &plusmn; 20 mm/yr of the 
  Greenland ice sheet above 2,000 m at latitudes up to 72&deg;N. Krabill et al. 
  (1999) observed a similar pattern above 2,000 m from 1993 to 1998 using satellite 
  referenced, repeat aircraft laser altimetry. Together, these results indicate 
  that this area of the Greenland ice sheet has been nearly in balance for two 
  decades, in agreement with the mass budget studies mentioned above (Thomas et 
  al., 2000). Krabill et al. (1999) observed markedly different behaviour at lower 
  altitudes, with thinning rates in excess of 2 m/yr in the south and east, which 
  they attributed in part to excess flow, although a series of warmer-than-average 
  summers may also have had an influence. In a recent update, Krabill et al. (2000) 
  find the total ice sheet balance to be -46x10<sup><small>12</small></sup> kg/yr or 0.13 mm/yr 
  of sea level rise between 1993 and 1999, but could not provide an error bar. 
  Incidentally, this value is very close to the century time-scale imbalance derived 
  from the mass budget studies (<a href="415.htm#tab115">Table 11.5</a>), although 
  the time periods are different and the laser altimetry results do not allow 
  us to distinguish between accumulation, ablation, and discharge.</p>
<p>Small changes of &plusmn; 11 mm/yr were reported by Lingle and Covey (1998) 
  in a region of East Antarctica between 20&deg; and 160&deg;E for the period 
  1978 to 1988. Wingham et al. (1998) examined the Antarctic ice sheet north of 
  82&deg;S from 1992 to 1996, excluding the marginal zone. They observed no change 
  in East Antarctica to within &plusmn; 5 mm/yr, but reported a negative trend 
  in West Antarctica of -53 &plusmn; 9 mm/yr, largely located in the Pine 
  Island and Thwaites Glacier basins. They estimated a century-scale mass imbalance 
  of -6% &plusmn; 8% of accumulation for 63% of the Antarctic ice sheet, concluding 
  that the thinning in West Antarctica is likely to result from a recent accumulation 
  deficit. However, the measurements of Rignot (1998a), showing a 1.2 &plusmn; 
  0.3 km/yr retreat of the grounding line of Pine Island Glacier between 1992 
  and 1996, suggest an ice-dynamic explanation for the observed thinning. Altimetry 
  records are at present too short to confidently distinguish between a short-term 
  surface mass-balance variation and the longer-term ice-sheet dynamic imbalance. 
  Van der Veen and Bolzan (1999) suggest that at least five years of data are 
  needed on the central Greenland ice sheet.</p>
