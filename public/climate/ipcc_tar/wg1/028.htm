<h2>E.7 Remaining Uncertainties in Detection and Attribution</h2>
<i>Some progress has been made in reducing uncertainty, though many of the sources 
of uncertainty identified in the SAR still exist. These include: </i><br>
<ul>
  <li><i>Discrepancies between the vertical profile of temperature change in the 
    troposphere seen in observations and models.</i> These have been reduced as 
    more realistic forcing histories have been used in models, although not fully 
    resolved. Also, the difference between observed surface and lower-tropospheric 
    trends over the last two decades cannot be fully reproduced by model simulations.<br>
  <li><i>Large uncertainties in estimates of internal climate variability from models 
    and observations.</i> Although as noted above, these are unlikely (bordering 
    on very unlikely) to be large enough to nullify the claim that a detectable 
    climate change has taken place. <br>
  <li><i>Considerable uncertainty in the reconstructions of solar and volcanic forcing 
    which are based on proxy or limited observational data for all but the last 
    two decades.</i> Detection of the influence of greenhouse gases on climate 
    appears to be robust to possible amplification of the solar forcing by ozone-solar 
    or solar-cloud interactions, provided these do not alter the pattern or time-dependence 
    of the response to solar forcing. Amplification of the solar signal by these 
    processes, which are not yet included in models, remains speculative. <br>
  <li><i>Large uncertainties in anthropogenic forcing are associated with the effects 
    of aerosols. </i>The effects of some anthropogenic factors, including organic 
    carbon, black carbon, biomass aerosols, and changes in land use, have not 
    been included in detection and attribution studies. Estimates of the size 
    and geographic pattern of the effects of these forcings vary considerably, 
    although individually their global effects are estimated to be relatively 
    small.<br>
  <li><i>Large differences in the response of different models to the same forcing.</i> 
    These differences, which are often greater than the difference in response 
    in the same model with and without aerosol effects, highlight the large uncertainties 
    in climate change prediction and the need to quantify uncertainty and reduce 
    it through better observational data sets and model improvement. <br>
</ul>

<h2>E.8 Synopsis</h2>
<i>In the light of new evidence and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, 
most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due 
to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.</i> <br>
