<h4>6.11.2.2 Cosmic rays and clouds</h4>
<p>Svensmark and Friis-Christensen (1997) demonstrated a high degree of correlation 
  between total cloud cover, from the ISCCP C2 data set, and cosmic ray flux between 
  1984 and 1991. Changes in the heliosphere arising from fluctuations in the Sun's 
  magnetic field mean that galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are less able to reach 
  the Earth when the Sun is more active so the cosmic ray flux is inversely related 
  to solar activity. Svensmark and Friis-Christensen analysed monthly mean data 
  of total cloud using only data over the oceans between 60&deg;S and 60&deg;N 
  from geostationary satellites. They found an increase in cloudiness of 3 to 
  4% from solar maximum to minimum and speculated that (a) increased GCR flux 
  causes an increase in total cloud and that (b) the increase in total cloud causes 
  a cooling of climate. Svensmark and Friis-Christensen (1997) also extended this 
  analysis to cover the years 1980 to 1996 using cloud data from the DMSP and 
  Nimbus-7 satellites and showed that the high correlation with GCR flux is maintained. 
  However, it was not possible to intercalibrate the different data sets so the 
  validity of the extended data set as a measure of variations in absolute total 
  cloudiness is open to question.</p>
<p>Svensmark (1998) showed that, at least for the limited period of this study, 
  total cloud varies more closely with GCRs than with the 10.7 cm solar activity 
  index over the past solar cycle. On longer time-scales he also demonstrated 
  that Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures between 1937 and 1994 follow variations 
  in cosmic ray flux and solar cycle length more closely than total irradiance 
  or sunspot number. There has been a long-term decrease in cosmic ray flux since 
  the late 17th century, as evidenced by the <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>14</sup>C 
  cosmogenic isotope records (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993; Beer et al., 1994), and 
  this mirrors the long-term increase in TSI. However, the TSI reconstruction 
  of Hoyt and Schatten (1993), which is based on solar cycle lengths, does not 
  appear to track the cosmogenic isotope records any more closely than that of 
  Lean et al. (1995), which is based on sunspot cycle amplitude (Lean and Rind, 
  1998). Such use of different solar indices may help to identify which physical 
  mechanisms, if any, are responsible for the apparent meteorological responses 
  to solar activity.</p>
<p>Kuang et al. (1998) have repeated Svensmark and Friis-Christensen's analysis 
  of ISCCP data and showed high correlations with an El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Osciallation 
  (ENSO) index difficult to distinguish from the GCR flux. Farrar (2000) showed 
  that the pattern of change in cloudiness over that period, particularly in the 
  Pacific Ocean, corresponds to what would be expected for the atmospheric circulation 
  changes characteristic of El Ni&ntilde;o. Kernthaler et al. (1999) have also 
  studied the ISCCP dataset, using both geostationary and polar orbiter data and 
  suggested that the correlation with cosmic ray flux is reduced if high latitude 
  data are included. This would not be expected if cosmic rays were directly inducing 
  increases in cloudiness, as cosmic ray flux is greatest at high latitudes. Kernthaler 
  et al. (1999), J&oslash;rgensen and Hansen (2000), and Gierens and Ponater (1999), 
  also noted that a mechanism whereby cosmic rays resulted in greater cloud cover 
  would be most likely to affect high cloud as ionisation is greatest at these 
  altitudes. Even if high cloud did respond to cosmic rays, it is not clear that 
  this would cause global cooling as for thin high cloud the long-wave warming 
  effects dominate the short-wave cooling effect. Kristj&aacute;nsson and Kristiansen 
  (2000) have additionally analysed the ISCCP D2 dataset, 1989 to 1993, and found 
  little statistical evidence of a relationship between GCRs and cloud cover with 
  the possible exception of low marine clouds in mid-latitudes. They also noted 
  that there was no correlation between outgoing long-wave radiation, as represented 
  in ERBE data, and GCRs. Thus the evidence for a cosmic ray impact on cloudiness 
  remains unproven.</p>
<p>A further consideration must be potential physical mechanisms whereby cosmic 
  rays might enhance cloudiness. Cosmic rays are the principal source of ionisation 
  in the free troposphere. Furthermore, ionisation rates and atmospheric conductivity 
  are observed to vary with solar activity. Svensmark and Friis-Christensen (1997) 
  propose that the correlation between cosmic rays and cloud cover that they observed 
  is due to an increase in efficiency of charged particles, over uncharged ones, 
  in acting as cloud condensation nuclei. There is evidence for this occurring 
  in thunderstorms (Pruppacher and Klett, 1997) but it is not clear to what extent 
  this affects cloud development. There is also evidence that ions are sometimes 
  critical in gas-to-particle conversion but again there is no evidence that this 
  has any impact on cloud formation.</p>
<p>In a series of papers, Brian Tinsley has developed a more detailed mechanism 
  for a link between cosmic rays and cloudiness (e.g., Tinsley, 1996). This is 
  based on the premise that aerosols ionised by cosmic rays are more effective 
  as ice nuclei and cause freezing of supercooled water in clouds. In clouds that 
  are likely to cause precipitation the latent heat thus released then causes 
  enhanced convection which promotes cyclonic development and hence increased 
  storminess. There is some laboratory evidence to suggest that charging increases 
  ice nucleation efficiency (Pruppacher, 1973) although there is no observational 
  evidence of this process taking place in the atmosphere. Furthermore, only a 
  small proportion of aerosol particles are capable of acting as ice nuclei, depending 
  on chemical composition or shape. There are also laboratory studies (Abbas and 
  Latham, 1969) which indicate the existence of "electrofreezing", but 
  again no evidence in the real atmosphere. Thus Tinsley's mechanism is plausible 
  but requires further observational and modelling studies to establish whether 
  or not it could be of sufficient magnitude to result in the claimed effects 
  (Harrison and Shine, 1999).</p>
<p>We conclude that mechanisms for the amplification of solar forcing are not 
  well established. Variations in ultraviolet and solar-induced changes in O<sub>3</sub> 
  may have a small effect on radiative forcing but additionally may affect climate 
  through changing the distribution of solar heating and thus indirectly through 
  a dynamical response. At present there is insufficient evidence to confirm that 
  cloud cover responds to solar variability.</p>
