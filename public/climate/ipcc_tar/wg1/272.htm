<h4>7.2.2.2 Convective processes</h4>
<p>The interplay of buoyancy, moisture and condensation on scales ranging from 
  millimetres to tens of kilometres is the defining physical feature of atmospheric 
  convection, and is the source of much of the challenge in representing convection 
  in climate models. Deep convection is in large measure responsible for the very 
  existence of the troposphere. Air typically receives its buoyancy through being 
  heated by contact with a warm, solar-heated underlying surface, and convection 
  redistributes the energy received by the surface upwards throughout the troposphere. 
  Shallow convection also figures importantly in the structure of the atmospheric 
  boundary layer and will be addressed in <a href="273.htm">Section 7.2.2.3</a>.</p>
<p> Latent heat release in convection drives many of the important atmospheric 
  circulations, and is a key link in the cycle of atmosphere-ocean feedbacks leading 
  to the ENSO phenomenon. Convection is a principal means of transporting moisture 
  vertically, which implies a role of convection in the radiative feedback due 
  to both water vapour and clouds. Convection also in large measure determines 
  the vertical temperature lapse rate of the atmosphere, and particularly so in 
  the tropics. A strong decrease of temperature with height enhances the greenhouse 
  effect, whereas a weaker temperature decrease ameliorates it. The effect of 
  lapse rate changes on clear-sky water vapour feedback has been studied by Zhang 
  et al. (1994), but the significance of the lapse rate contribution (cf. item 
  (5) of the SAR, Technical Summary) has been somewhat exaggerated through a misinterpretation 
  of the paper. In fact the variation in lapse rate effects among the models studied 
  alters the water vapour feedback factor by only 0.25 W/(m<sup>2</sup>K), or 
  about 10% of the total (Table 1 of Zhang et al., 1994).</p>
<p> There is ample theoretical and observational evidence that deep moist convection 
  locally establishes a "moist adiabatic" temperature profile that, 
  loosely speaking, is neutrally buoyant with respect to ascending, condensing 
  parcels (Betts, 1982; Xu and Emanuel, 1989). This adjustment happens directly 
  at the scale of individual convective clouds, but dynamical processes plausibly 
  extend the radius of influence of the adjustment to the scale of a typical GCM 
  grid box, and probably much further in the tropics, where the lapse rate adjusts 
  close to the moist adiabat almost everywhere. All convective schemes, from the 
  most simple Moist Adiabatic Adjustment to those which attempt a representation 
  of cloud-scale motions (Arakawa and Schubert, 1974; Emanuel, 1991), therefore 
  agree in that they maintain the temperature at a nearly moist adiabatic profile. 
  Moist Adiabatic Adjustment explicitly resets the temperature to the desired 
  profile, whereas mass flux schemes achieve the adjustment to a near-adiabat 
  as a consequence of equations governing the parametrized convective heating 
  field. The constraint on temperature, however, places only a limited constraint 
  on the moisture profile remaining after adjustment, and the performance in terms 
  of moisture, clouds and precipitation may be very variable. </p>
<p> Since the SAR, a variety of simulations of response to CO<sub>2</sub> doubling accounting 
  for combinations of different parametrizations have been realised with different 
  models (Colman and McAvaney, 1995; Yao and Del Genio, 1999; Meleshko et al., 
  2000). The general effects of the convection parametrization on climate sensitivity 
  are difficult to assess because the way a model responds to changes in convection 
  depends on a range of other parametrizations, so results are somewhat inconsistent 
  between models (Colman and McAvaney, 1995; Thompson and Pollard, 1995; Zhang 
  and McFarlane, 1995). There is some indication that the climate sensitivity 
  in models with strong negative cloud feedback is insensitive to convective parametrization 
  whereas models with strong positive cloud feedback show more sensitivity (Meleshko 
  et al., 2000).</p>
