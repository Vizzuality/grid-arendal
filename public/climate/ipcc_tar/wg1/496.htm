<h4>13.5.2.3 Risk assessment approaches</h4>
<p>Uncertainty analysis is required to perform quantitative risk or decision analysis 
  (see Toth and Mwandosya (2001) for discussion of decision analysis). By itself, 
  scenario analysis is not equivalent to uncertainty analysis because not all 
  possible scenarios are necessarily treated and, especially, because probabilities 
  are not attached to each scenario (see Morgan and Henrion (1990) for a general 
  treatment of uncertainty analysis; see Katz (2000) for a more recent overview 
  focusing on climate change). Recognising this limitation, a few recent studies 
  (Jones, 2000b; New and Hulme, 2000) have attempted to modify climate scenario 
  analysis, grouping a range of scenarios together and attaching a probability 
  to the resultant classes. Such an approach can be viewed as a first step in 
  bridging the gap between scenario and uncertainty analysis. Single climate scenarios, 
  by definition, are limited to plausibility with no degree of likelihood attached. 
  Since risk analysis requires that probabilities be attached to each climate 
  scenario, subjective probabilities can be applied to the input parameters that 
  determine the climate outcomes (e.g., emissions scenarios, the climate sensitivity, 
  regional climate response patterns), thus allowing distributions of outcomes 
  to be formally quantified.</p>
<p>In formal risk analysis, the extremes of the probability distribution should 
  encompass the full range of possible outcomes, although in climate change studies 
  this remains hard to achieve. The ranges for global warming and sea level rise 
  from the IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR), for 
  example, deliberately did not encompass the full range of possible outcomes 
  and made no reference to probability distributions. As a consequence, the bulk 
  of impact assessments have treated these IPCC ranges as having a uniform probability, 
  i.e., acting as if no information is available about what changes are more likely 
  than others. As pointed out by Titus and Narayanan (1996), Jones (1998, 2000a), 
  and Parkinson and Young (1998), however, where several sources of uncertainty 
  are combined, the resulting probability distribution is not uniform but is a 
  function of the component probability distributions and the relationship between 
  the component elements. For example, descriptions of regional changes in temperature 
  and rainfall over Australia constructed from regional response patterns have 
  been used in a number of hydrological studies where the extreme outcomes have 
  been considered as likely as outcomes in the centre of the range (e.g., Chiew 
  et al., 1995; Schreider et al., 1996; Whetton, 1998). However, when the two 
  component ranges - global warming and normalised local temperature and rainfall 
  change -are randomly sampled and then multiplied together, they offer a distinctly 
  non-uniform distribution (see <a href="#fig139">Figure 13.9a</a>). Further refinements 
  of these approaches for quantifying the risk of climate change are needed (New 
  and Hulme, 2000).</p>
<p>This approach to portraying uncertainty has potentially useful applications 
  when combined with climate impact sensitivity response surfaces (see <a href="479.htm">Section 
  13.2.1</a>; see also <a href="../wg2/122.htm">Chapter 3</a> of <a href="../wg2/index.htm">TAR 
  WG II</a> (Carter and La Rovere, 2001)). The superimposed response surfaces 
  allow the calculation of probabilities for exceeding particular impact thresholds 
  (<a href="#fig139">Figure 13.9b</a>). Another method of assessing risk using 
  quantified probability distributions is through a series of linked models such 
  as those used for calculating sea level rise (Titus and Narayanan, 1996) and 
  economic damage due to sea level rise (Yohe and Schlesinger, 1998), for quantifying 
  climate uncertainty (Visser et al., 2000), and in integrated assessments (Morgan 
  and Dowlatabadi, 1996). Efforts to make explicit probabilistic forecasts of 
  the climate response to a given emissions scenario for the near future have 
  been made using the current observed climate trajectory to constrain the "forecasts" 
  from several GCMs (Allen et al., 2000). More details on this technique are given 
  in <a href="462.htm">Section 12.4.3.3</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Figure 13.9:</b> (a) Projected ranges of regional annual temperature 
        and rainfall change for inland southern Australia in 2100 extrapolated 
        from CSIRO (1996) with temperature sampled randomly across the projected 
        ranges of both global and normalised regional warming and then multiplied 
        together. Projected regional ranges for normalised seasonal rainfall change 
        were randomly sampled, multiplied by the randomly sampled global warming 
        as above, and then averaged. The resulting probability density surface 
        reveals the likelihood of different climate change outcomes for this region; 
        (b) Response surface of irrigation demand for the same region superimposed 
        on projected climate changes as (a), showing the likelihood of exceeding 
        an annual allocation of irrigation water supply. Risk can be calculated 
        by summing the probabilities of all climates below a given level of annual 
        exceedance of annual water supply; e.g., 50%, or exceedance of the annual 
        water limit in at least one of every two years. (Source: Jones, 2000b.)
