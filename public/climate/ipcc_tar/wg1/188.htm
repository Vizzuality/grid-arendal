<h2>5.4 Global Models and Calculation of Direct and Indirect Climate Forcing</h2>
<h3><a name="541"></a>5.4.1 Summary of Current Model Capabilities</h3>
<p>In the past, many climate models used prescribed climatologies (Tanr&eacute; 
  et al., 1984: d'Almeida, 1991) or precalculated monthly or annual mean 
  column aerosol to describe the geographical distribution of aerosols and aerosol 
  types. Optical properties were calculated offline by Mie-calculations assuming 
  a uniform particle size, density and particle composition for each of the aerosol 
  components (Shettle and Fenn, 1976; Krekov, 1993).</p>
<p> Most current GCMs are beginning to incorporate the calculation of aerosol 
  mass interactively, taking account of the effect of aerosols on meteorology 
  (Taylor and Penner, 1994; Roeckner et al., 1999). In addition, models (GCMs 
  and Chemistry Transport Models) are now available which directly use information 
  on cloud formation and removal from the GCMs to account for the complex interactions 
  between cloud processes, heterogeneous chemistry and wet removal (e.g. Feichter 
  et al., 1997; Roelofs et al., 1998; Koch et al., 1999; Rasch et al., 2000a). 
  These models are able to represent the high temporal and spatial variability 
  of the aerosol particle mass distribution but must assume a size distribution 
  for the aerosol to calculate their radiative effects.</p>
<p> The number and size of primary aerosols depend on the initial size distribution 
  attributed to their source profiles together with the main growth and removal 
  process. Models which represent number concentration have been developed for 
  mineral dust studies (Tegen et al., 1996; Schulz et al., 1998) and for sea salt 
  aerosols (Gong et al., 1998). Representation of aerosol number is far more difficult 
  for sulphate and secondary organics because the size distributions of condensing 
  species depend on the size distribution of aerosols which are present before 
  condensation and on cloud processes, but attempts to include these processes 
  have been intiated (Herzog et al., 2000; Ghan et al., 2001a,b,c).</p>
<p> Because the processes for treating aerosol removal associated with precipitation 
  and deposition and in-cloud conversion of SO<sub>2</sub> to sulphate are represented 
  in climate models as sub-grid scale processes, there are significant variations 
  in the efficiency of these processes between different models (see <a href="172.htm#5226">Section 
  5.2.2.6</a>). In the past, model intercomparisons sponsored by the World Climate 
  Research Programme (WCRP) have focussed on <sup>222</sup>Rn, <sup>210</sup>Pb, 
  SO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> (Jacob et al., 1997; Rasch et 
  al., 2000b; Barrie et al., 2001). These comparisons provide a "snapshot" 
  in time of the relative performance of a major fraction of available large-scale 
  sulphur models. They have shown that most of the models are able to simulate 
  monthly average concentrations of species near the surface over continental 
  sites to within a factor of two. Models are less sensitive to changes in removal 
  rates near source regions, and they tend to agree more closely with observations 
  over source regions than over remote regions. Comparison of models with observations 
  at remote receptor sites can indicate whether transport and wet removal is well 
  simulated but, for sulphate, may also be an indication of whether local source 
  strengths are correctly estimated. The WCRP-sponsored model intercomparison 
  in 1995 showed that model simulations differed significantly in the upper troposphere 
  for species undergoing wet scavenging processes (Rasch et al., 2000b) and the 
  IPCC workshop (<a href="190.htm">Section 5.4.1.2</a>) demonstrated a similar 
  sensitivity. Unfortunately, observations to characterise particle concentrations 
  in remote regions and in the upper troposphere are limited. The vertical particle 
  distribution affects aerosol forcing because scattering particles exhibit a 
  greater forcing when they are located in the lower part of the troposphere, 
  due to the effects of humidity on their size. Also, absorbing aerosols yield 
  a greater forcing when the underlying surface albedo is high or when the aerosol 
  mass is above low clouds (Haywood and Ramaswamy, 1998).</p>
