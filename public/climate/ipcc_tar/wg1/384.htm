<h3>10.3.2 Simulations of Climate Change </h3>
<h4><a name="10321"></a>10.3.2.1 Mean climate</h4>
<p>Giorgi and Francisco (2000b) analysed regional temperature change in five AOGCMs 
  under a range of forcing scenarios. In all regions warming depended strongly 
  on the forcing scenario used and inter-model differences in simulated warming 
  were large compared to differences between ensemble members from a single model. 
  <a href="#fig103">Figure 10.3a</a> presents some results from Giorgi and Francisco 
  (2000b) relative to scenarios of 1%/yr increase in GHG concentration without 
  sulphate aerosol effects. Most regional warmings for 2071 to 2100 compared to 
  1961 to 1990 are in the range of 2 to 8&deg;C. Exceptions are the high northern 
  latitudes in DJF (5 to 11&deg;C in GRL, NAS and ALA) and central and eastern 
  Asia in DJF (3 to 11&deg;C in EAS, CAS and TIB). In many regions, the warming 
  is 2 to 3&deg;C higher in the CCC simulation than in the other models (e.g., 
  in the African regions of WAF, EAF, SAF and SAH). Giorgi and Francisco (2000b) 
  also considered corresponding simulations in which large increases in sulphate 
  aerosols (consistent with IS92a emission scenarios) were included in addition 
  to the GHG changes and found significantly reduced regional warming (the range 
  for most regions is 1.5 to 7&deg;C) (<a href="#fig103">Figure 10.3b</a>). Nearly 
  all the temperature changes in <a href="#fig103">Figure10.3a</a> were statistically 
  significant at the 5% confidence level (Giorgi and Francisco, 2000b).</p>
<p>Inter-model differences in regional warming partially reflect differences in 
  the global climate sensitivities of the models concerned. This effect may be 
  set aside by comparing the regional warmings given in Giorgi and Francisco (2000b) 
  with the corresponding global average warmings of the simulations used (<a href="#fig104">Figure 
  10.4</a>). Nearly all land areas warm more rapidly than the global average, 
  particularly those at high latitudes in the cold season. For both the non-sulphate 
  and sulphate cases, in the northern high latitudes, central Asia and Tibet (ALA, 
  GRL, NAS, CAS and TIB) in DJF and in northern Canada, Greenland and central 
  Asia and Tibet (GRL, CAS and TIB) in JJA, the warming is in excess of 40% above 
  the global average. In both cases, warming is less than the global average in 
  South and Southeast Asia, and southern South America (SAS, SEA and SSA) in JJA. 
  In this analysis, differences between the non-sulphate and sulphate cases are 
  minor. A strong contribution to the enhancement of warming over cold climate 
  regions is given by the snow and sea ice albedo feedback mechanism (Giorgi and 
  Francisco, 2000b). The snow albedo feedback also tends to enhance warming over 
  high elevation regions (Fyfe and Flato, 1999).</p>

            models on the magnitude of regional relative warming ("Inconsistent 
            magnitude of warming"). There is also a category for agreement 
            on cooling (which is not used). GG is the greenhouse gas only case 
            (see <a href="#fig103">Figure 10.3a</a>), and, GS, the greenhouse

<p>In line with the globally averaged precipitation increase given by all models 
  (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>), precipitation is also simulated to increase 
  regionally in the majority of cases. However, regions of precipitation decrease 
  are also simulated. Precipitation reduction can be due to changes in large and 
  synoptic scale features (e.g., changes in storm track characteristics) and/or 
  to local feedback processes (e.g., between soil moisture and precipitation). 
  The results of the regional analysis of Giorgi and Francisco (2000b) are presented 
  in <a href="#fig105">Figure 10.5</a> (as percentage changes for each model, 
  region and forcing scenario) and are used in an analysis of inter-model consistency 
  which is presented in <a href="#fig106">Figure 10.6</a>. In both the non-sulphate 
  and sulphate cases for DJF, most simulations show increased precipitation for 
  regions in the mid- to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (ALA, GRL, 
  WNA, ENA, CNA, NEU, NAS, CAS and TIB) and over Antarctica (ANT). In the tropics, 
  models consistently show increase in Africa (EAF and WAF), increase or little 
  change in South America (AMZ) and little change in Southeast Asia (SEA). Simulated 
  regional precipitation decreases are common in sub-tropical latitudes, but only 
  for central America (CAM) and northern Australia (NAU) are decreases indicated 
  by most models in both cases. The pattern is broadly similar in JJA, although 
  with some features shifting northwards. Only the high-latitude regions (ANT, 
  ALA, GRL and NAS) show consistent increase. There is disagreement on the direction 
  of change in a number of regions in the northern mid-latitudes and the sub-tropics, 
  although consistent decrease is evident in the Mediterranean Basin (MED) and 
  central American (CAM) regions. Some regions along the Inter-Tropical Convergence 
  Zone (ITCZ) show consistent increase or little change (AMZ , SEA and SAS), but 
  eastern Africa (EAF) shows a consistent decrease. In the Southern Hemisphere, 
  only Australia (SAU and NAU) shows a consistent pattern of change in both cases 
  (decrease). When the non-sulphate and sulphate cases are contrasted, more frequent 
  simulated precipitation decrease may be noted in parts of North America, Africa 
  and Asia for the case with increased sulphate aerosols (see results in <a href="#fig106">Figure 
  10.6</a> for SAF, CNA, CAS and EAS).</p>

<p>The magnitude of regional precipitation change varies considerably amongst 
  models, with the typical range being around 0 to 50% where the direction of 
  change is strongly indicated and around -30 to +30% where it is not. Larger 
  ranges occur in some regions (e.g., -30 to +60% in southern Africa in JJA for 
  GHG only forcing), but this occurs mainly in regions of low seasonal precipitation 
  where the implied range in absolute terms would not be large. Changes are consistently 
  large (greater than 20% averaged across models) in both the sulphate and non-sulphate 
  cases in northern high latitude regions (GRL, NEU and NAS, positive change) 
  in DJF and central America (CAM, negative change) in DJF. The number of precipitation 
  changes statistically significant at the 5% confidence level varied widely across 
  regions and seasons.</p>
