      to large uncertainties. Note that the Mann temperatures do not include data 
      after 1980 and do not show the large observed warming then. (b) As for (a)

<p><i><a name="fig126"></a>Studies linking forcing and response through correlation 
  techniques</i><br>
  A number of authors have correlated solar forcing and volcanic forcing with 
  hemispheric and global mean temperature time-series from instrumental and palaeo-data 
  (Lean et al., 1995; Briffa et al., 1998; Lean and Rind, 1998; Mann et al., 1998) 
  and found statistically significant correlations. Others have compared the simulated 
  response, rather than the forcing, with observations and found qualitative evidence 
  for the influence of natural forcing on climate (e.g., Crowley and Kim, 1996; 
  Overpeck et al., 1997; Wigley et al., 1997; Bertrand et al., 1999) or significant 
  correlations (e.g., Sch&ouml;nwiese et al., 1997; Free and Robock, 1999; Grieser 
  and Sch&ouml;nwiese, 2001). Such a comparison is preferable as the climate response 
  may differ substantially from the forcing. The results suggest that global scale 
  low-frequency temperature variations are influenced by variations in known natural 
  forcings. However, these results show that the late 20th century surface warming 
  cannot be well represented by natural forcing (solar and volcanic individually 
  or in combination) alone (for example <a href="#fig126">Figures 12.6</a>, <a href="#fig127">12.7</a>; 
  Lean and Rind, 1998; Free and Robock, 1999; Crowley, 2000; Tett et al., 2000; 
  Thejll and Lassen, 2000). </p>
<p>Mann et al. (1998, 2000) used a multi-correlation technique and found significant 
  correlations with solar and, less so, with the volcanic forcing over parts of 
  the palaeo-record. The authors concluded that natural forcings have been important 
  on decadal-to-century time-scales, but that the dramatic warming of the 20th 
  century correlates best and very significantly with greenhouse gas forcing. 
  The use of multiple correlations avoids the possibility of spuriously high correlations 
  due to the common trend in the solar and temperature time-series (Laut and Gunderman, 
  1998). Attempts to estimate the contributions of natural and anthropogenic forcing 
  to 20th century temperature evolution simultaneously are discussed in <a href="456.htm">Section 
  12.4</a>.</p>
<p><i>Summary</i><br>
  We conclude that climate forcing by changes in solar irradiance and volcanism 
  have likely caused fluctuations in global and hemispheric mean temperatures. 
  Qualitative comparisons suggest that natural forcings produce too little warming 
  to fully explain the 20th century warming (see <a href="#fig127">Figure 12.7</a>). 
  The indication that the trend in net solar plus volcanic forcing has been negative 
  in recent decades (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a>) makes it unlikely that 
  natural forcing can explain the increased rate of global warming since the middle 
  of the 20th century. This question will be revisited in a more quantitative 
  manner in <a href="456.htm">Section 12.4</a>. <a name="fig127"></a> </p>

      <p><b>Figure 12.7:</b> Global mean surface temperature anomalies relative 
        to the 1880 to 1920 mean from the instrumental record compared with ensembles 
        of four simulations with a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model (from 
        Stott et al., 2000b; Tett et al., 2000) forced (a) with solar and volcanic 
        forcing only, (b) with anthropogenic forcing including well mixed greenhouse 
        gases, changes in stratospheric and tropospheric ozone and the direct 
        and indirect effects of sulphate aerosols, and (c) with all forcings, 
        both natural and anthropogenic. The thick line shows the instrumental 
        data while the thin lines show the individual model simulations in the 
        ensemble of four members. Note that the data are annual mean values. The 
        model data are only sampled at the locations where there are observations. 
        The changes in sulphate aerosol are calculated interactively, and changes 
        in tropospheric ozone were calculated offline using a chemical transport 
        model. Changes in cloud brightness (the first indirect effect of sulphate 
        aerosols) were calculated by an offline simulation (Jones et al., 1999) 
        and included in the model. The changes in stratospheric ozone were based 
        on observations. The volcanic forcing was based on the data of Sato et 
        al. (1993) and the solar forcing on Lean et al. (1995), updated to 1997. 
        The net anthropogenic forcing at 1990 was 1.0 Wm<sup>-2</sup> including a net cooling 
        of 1.0 Wm<sup>-2</sup> due to sulphate aerosols. The net natural forcing for 1990 
        relative to 1860 was 0.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup> , and for 1992 was a net cooling of 2.0 
        Wm<sup>-2</sup> due to Mt. Pinatubo. Other models forced with anthropogenic forcing 
        give similar results to those shown in b (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
        8</a>, <a href="326.htm#861">Section 8.6.1</a>, <a href="326.htm#fig815">Figure 
        8.15</a>; Hasselmann et al., 1995; Mitchell et al., 1995b; Haywood et 
        al., 1997; Boer et al., 2000a; Knutson et al., 2000). </p>
