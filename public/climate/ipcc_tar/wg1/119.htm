<h2>3.7 Projections of CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration and their Implications </h2>
<h3><a name="371"></a>3.7.1 Terrestrial Carbon Model Responses to Scenarios of 
  Change in CO<sub>2</sub> and Climate</h3>
<p>Possible feedbacks from terrestrial carbon cycling to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  were assessed using multiple models by Cramer et al. (2001). Six DGVMs (<a href="118.htm#fig310">Figure 
  3.10a</a>) (Foley et al., 1996; Brovkin et al., 1997; Friend et al., 1997; Woodward 
  et al., 1998; Huntingford et al., 2000; Sitch, 2000) were driven first by CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentrations derived from the IS92a emissions scenario as in the SAR, and 
  then with CO<sub>2</sub> changes plus climate changes derived from the HadCM2 
  coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model simulation including sulphate 
  aerosol effects as described by Mitchell et al. (1995). Except for one empirical 
  model (VECODE; Brovkin et al., 1997), the models included explicit representation 
  of all the following processes: the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation effect on NPP 
  (modelled explicitly in terms of photosynthesis, respiration, and feedbacks 
  associated with carbon allocation); responses of NPP to climate specific to 
  each plant functional type (PFT); competition among PFTs for light and water; 
  dynamic shifts in vegetation structure due to climate and CO<sub>2</sub> effects; 
  competitive limits to above-ground biomass; natural disturbance regimes and 
  their interaction with PFT composition; soil temperature and moisture effects 
  on heterotrophic respiration. Two models include an interactive N cycle. Land 
  use and anthropogenic N deposition were not considered. </p>
<p>Driven by increases in CO<sub>2</sub> beyond the present day, the modelled 
  sink due to CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation continued to increase. By the middle 
  of the 21st century the simulated land-atmosphere flux due to CO<sub>2</sub> 
  was in the range -8.7 to -3.6 PgC/yr. Beyond mid-century the rate of increase 
  became less, due to the declining photosynthetic response to CO<sub>2</sub>. 
  When the climate change scenario was included as well as the CO<sub>2</sub> 
  increase, modelled uptake was reduced compared with the CO<sub>2</sub>-only 
  analysis. At mid-century, climate change reduced the uptake by 21 to 43%. A 
  marked decline in terrestrial uptake after the mid-century was seen in two models, 
  and one model had zero terrestrial uptake by 2100. By 2100 the range of model 
  estimates of the land-atmosphere flux had widened to -6.7 to +0.4 PgC/yr. Increasing 
  heterotrophic respiration in response to warming (Cao and Woodward, 1998a,b; 
  Cramer et al., 2001) was a common factor (but not the only one) leading to reduced 
  land uptake. The differences among the modelled climate responses were largely 
  due to unresolved discrepancies in the response of global NPP to temperature. 
  The balance of positive versus negative regional effects of climate change on 
  NPP was estimated differently by these models, to the extent that the sign of 
  the global response of NPP to climate change alone was not consistent. In addition, 
  one model simulated a partial replacement of the Amazon rainforest by C<sub>4</sub> 
  grassland. This response was not shown, or occurred on a much smaller scale, 
  in the other models. The details of this modelling exercise are presumably dependent 
  on sensitivity of the particular climate model, and regional aspects of the 
  simulated climate change (Cramer et al., 2001).</p>
