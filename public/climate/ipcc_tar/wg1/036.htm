<a name="figTechSum28"></a>The previous sections have contained descriptions of 
the current state of knowledge of the climate of the past and present, the current 
understanding of the forcing agents and processes in the climate system and how 
well they can be represented in climate models. Given the knowledge possessed 
today, the best assessment was given whether climate change can be detected and 
whether that change can be attributed to human influence. With the best tools 
available today, projections were made of how the climate could change in the 
future for different scenarios of emissions of greenhouse gases.<br>
<p>This Section looks into the future in a different way. Uncertainties are present 
  in each step of the chain from emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, through 
  to the impacts that they have on the climate system and society (see <a href="#figTechSum28">Figure 
  28</a>). Many factors continue to limit the ability to detect, attribute, and 
  understand current climate change and to project what future climate changes 
  may be. Further work is needed in nine broad areas.</p>
<a name="g1"></a> 
<h2>G.1 Data</h2>
<i>Arrest the decline of observational networks in many parts of the world. </i>Unless 
networks are significantly improved, it may be difficult or impossible to detect 
climate change in many areas of the globe.<br>
<p><i>Expand the observational foundation for climate studies to provide accurate, 
  long-term data with expanded temporal and spatial coverage.</i> Given the complexity 
  of the climate system and the inherent multi-decadal time-scale, there is a 
  need for long-term consistent data to support climate and environmental change 
  investigations and projections. Data from the present and recent past, climate-relevant 
  data for the last few centuries, and for the last several millennia are all 
  needed. There is a particular shortage of data in polar regions and data for 
  the quantitative assessment of extremes on the global scale.</p>
<a name="g2"></a> 
<h2>G.2 Climate Processes and Modelling</h2>
<i>Estimate better future emissions and concentrations of greenhouse gases and 
aerosols.</i> It is particularly important that improvements are realised in deriving 
concentrations from emissions of gases and particularly aerosols, in addressing 
biogeochemical sequestration and cycling, and specifically, and in determining 
the spatial-temporal distribution of CO<sub>2</sub> sources and sinks, currently 
and in the future.<br>
<p><i>Understand and characterise more completely dominant processes (e.g., ocean 
  mixing) and feedbacks (e.g., from clouds and sea ice) in the atmosphere, biota, 
  land and ocean surfaces, and deep oceans.</i> These sub-systems, phenomena, 
  and processes are important and merit increased attention to improve prognostic 
  capabilities generally. The interplay of observation and models will be the 
  key for progress. The rapid forcing of a non-linear system has a high prospect 
  of producing surprises.</p>
<p><i>Address more completely patterns of long-term climate variability.</i> This 
  topic arises both in model calculations and in the climate system. In simulations, 
  the issue of climate drift within model calculations needs to be clarified better 
  in part because it compounds the difficulty of distinguishing signal and noise. 
  With respect to the long-term natural variability in the climate system per 
  se, it is important to understand this variability and to expand the emerging 
  capability of predicting patterns of organised variability such as ENSO.</p>
<p><i>Explore more fully the probabilistic character of future climate states 
  by developing multiple ensembles of model calculations.</i> The climate system 
  is a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore the long-term prediction 
  of future exact climate states is not possible. Rather the focus must be upon 
  the prediction of the probability distribution of the system's future possible 
  states by the generation of ensembles of model solutions.</p>
<p><i>Improve the integrated hierarchy of global and regional climate models with 
  emphasis on improving the simulation of regional impacts and extreme weather 
  events. </i>This will require improvements in the understanding of the coupling 
  between the major atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial systems, and extensive 
  diagnostic modelling and observational studies that evaluate and improve simulative 
  performance. A particularly important issue is the adequacy of data needed to 
  attack the question of changes in extreme events.</p>
<a name="g3"></a> 
<h2>G.3 Human Aspects</h2>
<i>Link more formally physical climate-biogeochemical models with models of the 
human system and thereby provide the basis for expanded exploration of possible 
cause-effect-cause patterns linking human and non-human components of the Earth 
system.</i> At present, human influences generally are treated only through emission 
scenarios that provide external forcings to the climate system. In future more 
comprehensive models are required in which human activities need to begin to interact 
with the dynamics of physical, chemical, and biological sub-systems through a 
diverse set of contributing activities, feedbacks and responses.<br>
<a name="g4"></a> 
<h2>G.4 International Framework</h2>
<i>Accelerate internationally progress in understanding climate change by strengthening 
the international framework that is needed to co-ordinate national and institutional 
efforts so that research, computational, and observational resources may be used 
to the greatest overall advantage.</i> Elements of this framework exist in the 
international programmes supported by the International Council of Scientific 
Unions (ICSU), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP), and the United Nations Education, Scientific and 
Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). There is a corresponding need for strengthening 
the co-operation within the international research community, building research 
capacity in many regions and, as is the goal of this assessment, effectively describing 
research advances in terms that are relevant to decision making.<br>
