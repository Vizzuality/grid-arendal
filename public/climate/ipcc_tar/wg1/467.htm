<h2>12.6 Concluding Remarks </h2>
<p>In the previous sections, we have evaluated the different lines of evidence 
  on the causes of recent climate change. Here, we summarise briefly the arguments 
  that lead to our final assessment. The reader is referred to the earlier sections 
  for more detail.</p>
<p><i>20th century climate was unusual.</i><br>
  Palaeoclimatic reconstructions for the last 1,000 years (e.g., <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>, <a href="069.htm#fig221">Figure 2.21</a>) indicate that the 20th century 
  warming is highly unusual, even taking into account the large uncertainties 
  in these reconstructions. </p>
<p><i>The observed warming is inconsistent with model estimates of natural internal 
  climate variability. </i><br>
  While these estimates vary substantially, on the annual to decadal time-scale 
  they are similar, and in some cases larger, than obtained from observations. 
  Estimates from models and observations are uncertain on the multi-decadal and 
  longer time-scales required for detection. Nonetheless, conclusions on the detection 
  of an anthropogenic signal are insensitive to the model used to estimate internal 
  variability. Recent observed changes cannot be accounted for as pure internal 
  variability even if the amplitude of simulated internal variations is increased 
  by a factor of two or more. It is therefore unlikely (bordering on very unlikely) 
  that natural internal variability alone can explain the changes in global climate 
  over the 20th century (e.g., <a href="445.htm#fig121">Figure 12.1</a>).</p>
<p><i>The observed warming in the latter half of the 20th century appears to be 
  inconsistent with natural external (solar and volcanic) forcing of the climate 
  system.</i><br>
  Although there are measurements of these forcings over the last two decades, 
  estimates prior to that are uncertain, as the volcanic forcing is based on limited 
  measurements, and the solar forcing is based entirely on proxy data. However, 
  the overall trend in natural forcing over the last two, and perhaps four, decades 
  of the 20th century is likely to have been small or negative (<a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>, <a href="254.htm#tab613">Table 6.13</a>) and so is unlikely to explain 
  the increased rate of global warming since the middle of the 20th century.</p>
<p><i>The observed change in patterns of atmospheric temperature in the vertical 
  is inconsistent with natural forcing.</i><br>
  The increase in volcanic activity during the past two to four decades would, 
  if anything, produce tropospheric cooling and stratospheric warming, the reverse 
  to what has occurred over this period (e.g., <a href="452.htm#fig128">Figure 
  12.8</a>). Increases in solar irradiance could account for some of the observed 
  tropospheric warming, but mechanisms by which this could cool the stratosphere 
  (e.g., through changes in stratospheric ozone) remain speculative. Observed 
  increases in stratospheric water vapour might also account for some of the observed 
  stratospheric cooling. Estimated changes in solar radiative forcing over the 
  20th century are substantially smaller than those due to greenhouse gas forcing, 
  unless mechanisms exist which enhance the effects of solar radiation changes 
  at the ground. Palaeo-data show little evidence of such an enhancement at the 
  surface in the past. Simulations based solely on the response to natural forcing 
  (e.g., <a href="450.htm#fig127">Figure 12.7a</a>) are inconsistent with the 
  observed climate record even if the model-simulated response is allowed to scale 
  up or down to match the observations. It is therefore unlikely that natural 
  forcing and internal variability together can explain the instrumental temperature 
  record.</p>
<p><i>Anthropogenic factors do provide an explanation of 20th century temperature 
  change.</i><br>
  All models produce a response pattern to combined greenhouse gas and sulphate 
  aerosol forcing that is detectable in the 20th century surface temperature record 
  (e.g., <a href="460.htm#fig1210">Figures 12.10</a>, <a href="463.htm#fig1212">12.12</a> 
  (one model produces an estimate of internal variability which is not consistent 
  with that observed)). Given that sulphate aerosol forcing is negative, and hence 
  tends to reduce the response, detection of the response to the combined forcing 
  indicates the presence of a greenhouse gas signal that is at least as large 
  as the combined signal.</p>
<p><i>The effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases is detected, despite uncertainties 
  in sulphate aerosol forcing and response.</i><br>
  The analysis used to derive <a href="460.htm#fig1210">Figures 12.10a</a> and 
  <a href="463.htm#fig1212">12.12</a>, left box, assumes that the ratio of the 
  greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol responses in each model is correct. Given 
  the uncertainty in sulphate aerosol forcing, this may not be the case. Hence 
  one must also consider the separate responses to greenhouse gases and aerosols 
  simultaneously. A greenhouse gas signal is consistently detected in the observations 
  (e.g., <a href="460.htm#fig1210">Figure 12.10b,c</a>, <a href="463.htm#fig1212">Figure 
  12.12</a> right hand boxes; North and Wu, 2001; Tett et al. 2000). The greenhouse 
  gas responses are consistent with the observations in all but one case. The 
  two component studies all indicate a substantial detectable greenhouse gas signal, 
  despite uncertainties in aerosol forcing. The spread of estimates of the sulphate 
  signal emphasises the uncertainty in sulphate aerosol forcing and response.</p>
<p><i>It is unlikely that detection studies have mistaken a natural signal for 
  an anthropogenic signal.</i><br>
  In order to demonstrate an anthropogenic contribution to climate, it is necessary 
  to rule out the possibility that the detection procedure has mistaken part or 
  all of a natural signal for an anthropogenic change. On physical grounds, natural 
  forcing is unlikely to account completely for the observed warming over the 
  last three to five decades, given that it is likely that the overall trend in 
  natural forcing over most of the 20th century is small or negative. Several 
  studies have involved three or more components - the responses to greenhouse 
  gases, sulphate aerosols and natural (solar, volcanic or volcanic and solar) 
  forcing. These studies all detect a substantial greenhouse gas contribution 
  over the last fifty years, though in one case the estimated greenhouse gas amplitude 
  is inconsistent with observations. Thus it is unlikely that we have misidentified 
  the solar signal completely as a greenhouse gas response, but uncertainty in 
  the amplitude of the response to natural forcing continues to contribute to 
  uncertainty in the size of the anthropogenic signal.</p>
<p><i>The detection methods used should not be sensitive to errors in the amplitude 
  of the global mean forcing or response.</i><br>
  Signal estimation methods (e.g., <a href="460.htm#fig1210">Figures 12.10</a>, 
  <a href="462.htm#fig1211">12.11</a> and <a href="463.htm#fig1212">12.12</a>) 
  allow for errors in the amplitude of the response, so the results should not 
  be sensitive to errors in the magnitude of the forcing or the magnitude of the 
  simulated model response. This would reduce the impact of uncertainty in indirect 
  sulphate forcing on the estimated greenhouse and net sulphate signal amplitudes, 
  to the extent that the pattern of response to indirect sulphate forcing resembles 
  the pattern of response to direct sulphate forcing. Some models indicate this 
  is may be the case, others do not, so this remains an important source of uncertainty. 
  Note that if the spatio-temporal pattern of response to indirect sulphate forcing 
  were to resemble the greenhouse response, it would lead to the amplitude of 
  the greenhouse response being underestimated in cases where indirect sulphate 
  forcing has not been included in the model. Detection and attribution results 
  are also expected to be insensitive to all but the largest scale details of 
  radiative forcing patterns. Detection is only possible at the largest spatial 
  scales (e.g., Stott and Tett, 1998). In addition, atmospheric motions and large-scale 
  feedbacks smooth out the response. All these arguments tend to reduce the impact 
  of the large uncertainty in the magnitude of the forcing due to indirect sulphate 
  aerosols. The inclusion of forcing from additional aerosols (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>) is unlikely to alter our conclusion concerning the detection of a substantial 
  greenhouse gas signal, though it is likely to affect estimates of the sulphate 
  aerosol response. This is because part of the response to sulphate aerosols 
  can be considered as surrogate for other aerosols, even though the patterns 
  of forcing and response may differ on smaller scales. In general, the estimates 
  of global mean forcing for other neglected factors are small (see <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>, <a href="245.htm#fig66">Figure 6.6</a>). </p>
<p><i>Studies of the changes in the vertical patterns of temperature also indicate 
  that there has been an anthropogenic influence on climate over the last 35 years. 
  </i><br>
  One study finds that even when changes in stratospheric ozone and solar irradiance 
  are taken into account, there is a detectable greenhouse gas signal in the vertical 
  temperature record. </p>
<p><i>Observed and simulated vertical lapse rate changes are inconsistent over 
  the last two decades, but there is an anthropogenic influence on tropospheric 
  temperatures over a longer period.</i><br>
  Over the last twenty years, the observed warming trend in the lower troposphere 
  has been smaller than at the surface. This contrasts with model simulations 
  of the response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols. Natural 
  climate variability and the influence of natural external forcing, such as volcanism, 
  can explain part of this difference. However, a discrepancy remains that cannot 
  be accounted for with current climate models. The reduced warming in the lower 
  troposphere does not, however, call into question the fact that the surface 
  temperature has been warming over the satellite period (e.g., National Academy 
  of Sciences, 2000). Over the longer period for which radiosonde data are available, 
  an anthropogenic influence due to increasing greenhouse gases and decreasing 
  stratospheric ozone is detected in all studies.</p>
<p><i>Natural factors may have contributed to the early century warming.</i><br>
  Most of the discussion in this section has been concerned with evidence relating 
  to a human effect on late 20th century climate. The observed global mean surface 
  temperature record shows two main periods of warming. Some studies detect a 
  solar influence on surface temperature over the first five decades of the century, 
  with perhaps a small additional warming due to increases in greenhouse gases. 
  One study suggests that the early warming could be due to a combination of anthropogenic 
  effects and a highly unusual internal variation. Thus the early century warming 
  could be due to some combination of natural internal variability, changes in 
  solar irradiance and some anthropogenic influence. The additional warming in 
  the second half-century is most likely to be due to a substantial warming due 
  to increases in greenhouse gases, partially offset by cooling due to aerosols, 
  and perhaps by cooling due to natural factors towards the end of the period.</p>
