<h2>7.2 Atmospheric Processes and Feedbacks</h2>
<h3><a name="721"></a>7.2.1 Physics of the Water Vapour and Cloud Feedbacks</h3>
<p>Any increase in the amount of a greenhouse gas contained in the Earth's 
  atmosphere would reduce the emission of outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) if 
  the temperature of the atmosphere and surface were held fixed. The climate achieves 
  a new equilibrium by warming until the OLR increases enough to balance the incoming 
  solar radiation. Addition of greenhouse gases affects the OLR primarily because 
  the tropospheric temperature decreases with height. With a fixed temperature 
  profile, increasing the greenhouse gas content makes the higher parts of the 
  atmosphere more opaque to infrared radiation upwelling from below, replacing 
  this radiation with OLR emitted from the colder regions. </p>
<p> Determination of the new equilibrium is complicated by the fact that water 
  vapour is itself a potent greenhouse gas, and the amount and distribution of 
  water vapour will generally change as the climate changes. The atmospheric water 
  vapour content responds to changes in temperature, microphysical processes and 
  the atmospheric circulation. An overarching consideration is that the maximum 
  amount of water vapour air can hold increases rapidly with temperature, in accord 
  with the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. This affects all aspects of the hydrological 
  cycle. Unlike CO<sub>2</sub>, water vapour concentration varies substantially 
  in both the vertical and horizontal. An increase in water vapour reduces the 
  OLR only if it occurs at an altitude where the temperature is lower than the 
  ground temperature, and the impact grows sharply as the temperature difference 
  increases. If water vapour at such places increases as the climate warms, then 
  the additional reduction in OLR requires the new equilibrium to be warmer than 
  it would have been if water vapour content had remained fixed. This is referred 
  to as a positive water vapour feedback. </p>
<p>Clouds are intimately connected to the water vapour pattern, as clouds occur 
  in connection with high relative humidity, and cloud processes in turn affect 
  the moisture distribution. Clouds affect OLR in the same way as a greenhouse 
  gas, but their net effect on the radiation budget is complicated by the fact 
  that clouds also reflect incoming solar radiation. As clouds form the condensation 
  releases latent heat, which is a central influence in many atmospheric circulations. 
</p>
<p> The boundary layer is the turbulent, well-mixed shallow layer near the ground, 
  which can be regarded as being directly moistened by evaporation from the surface. 
  In the boundary layer, the increase in water vapour with temperature in proportion 
  with the Clausius-Clapeyron relation is uncontroversial. Observations (e.g., 
  Wentz and Schabel, 2000) clearly show a very strong relation of total column 
  water vapour (precipitable water) with surface and tropospheric temperature. 
  Because the boundary-layer temperature is similar to that of the ground, however, 
  boundarylayer water vapour is not of direct significance to the water vapour 
  feedback. Furthermore, half of the atmospheric water vapour is below 850 mb, 
  so measurements of total column water have limited utility in understanding 
  water vapour feedback. The part of the troposphere above the boundary layer 
  is referred to as the "free troposphere". Water vapour is brought 
  to the free troposphere by a variety of mixing and transport processes, and 
  water vapour feedback is determined by the aggregate effects of changes in the 
  transport and in the rate at which water is removed by precipitation occurring 
  when air parcels are cooled, usually by rising motions.</p>
<p> The complexity of water vapour radiative impact is reflected in the intricate 
  and strongly inhomogeneous patterns of the day-to-day water vapour distribution 
  (<a href="#fig71">Figure 7.1a</a>). The very dry and very moist regions reveal 
  a strong influence of the large-scale dynamical transport. Model simulations 
  exhibit similar patterns (<a href="#fig71">Figure 7.1b</a>), with a notable 
  qualitative improvement at higher resolution (<a href="#fig71">Figure 7.1c</a>). 
  Understanding the dominant transport processes that set up those patterns, and 
  how they can be affected by a modified climate, should help assess the representation 
  of the water vapour feedbacks in the corresponding region found in model simulations.

      <p><i><b>Figure 7.1:</b> Comparison between an observational estimate from 
        satellite radiances and two model simulations of the complex structure 
        of midtropospheric water vapour distribution for the date May 5. At any 
        instant, water vapour is unevenly distributed in the atmosphere with very 
        dry areas adjacent to very moist areas. Any modification in the statistics 
        of those areas participates in the atmospheric feedback. The observed 
        small-scale structure of the strong and variable gradients (a) is not 
        well resolved in a simulation with a climate model of the spatial resolution 
        currently used for climate projections (b), but simulated with much better 
        fidelity in models with significantly higher resolution (c). (a): Distribution 
        of mean relative humidity in layer 250 to 600 mb on May 5, 1998, as retrieved 
        from observations on SSM/T-2 satellite (Spencer and Braswell, 1997). Missing 
        data are indicated by black areas and the retrieval is most reliable in 
        the latitude band 30&deg;S to 30&deg;N. (b): Relative humidity at about 
        400 mb for May 5 of an arbitrary year from a simulation with the GFDL 
        R30L14 atmospheric general circulation model used in the AMIP I simulation 
        (Gates et al., 1999; Lau and Nath, 1999). In small polar areas (about 
        5% of the globe) some relative humidities are negative (set to zero) due 
        to numerical spectral effects. (c): Relative humidity at 400 mb from the 
        ECHAM4 T106 simulation for May 5 of an arbitrary year (Roeckner et al., 
        1996; Wild et al., 1998).</i></p>
