<h2>13.6 Consistency of Scenario Components </h2>
<p>This section discusses some of the caveats of climate scenario development 
  and focuses on the need for consistency in representing different physical aspects 
  of the climate system. It does not discuss the many possible inconsistencies 
  with respect to socio-economic issues in scenario development. <a href="../wg2/122.htm">Chapter 
  3</a> of the <a href="../wg2/index.htm">TAR WG II</a> (Carter and La Rovere, 2001) and 
  <a href="../wg3/068.htm">Chapter 2</a> of the <a href="../wg3/index.htm">TAR WG III</a> (Morita 
  and Robinson, 2001) provide a detailed treatment of these issues. Three common 
  inconsistencies in applying climate scenarios are discussed, concerning the 
  representation of ambient versus equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, biosphere-ocean-atmosphere 
  interactions and time lags between sea level rise and temperature change. </p>
<p>The climate system consists of several components that interact with and influence 
  each other at many different temporal and spatial scales (see <a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a>). This complexity adds further constraints to the development of climate 
  scenarios, though their relevance is strongly dependent on the objectives and 
  scope of the studies that require scenarios. Most climate scenarios are based 
  on readily available climate variables (e.g., from AOGCMs) and, where these 
  are used in impact assessments, studies are often restricted to an analysis 
  of the effects of changes in climate alone. However, other related environmental 
  aspects may also change, and these are often neglected or inadequately represented, 
  thus potentially reducing the comprehensiveness of the impact assessment. Furthermore, 
  some feedback processes that are seldom considered in AOGCM simulations, may 
  modify regional changes in climate (e.g., the effect of climate-induced shifts 
  in vegetation on albedo and surface roughness).</p>
<p>Concurrent changes in atmospheric concentrations of gases such as CO<sub>2</sub>, 
  sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) can have important 
  effects on biological systems. Studies of the response of biotic systems require 
  climate scenarios that include consistent information on future levels of these 
  species. For example, most published AOGCM simulations have used CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent 
  concentrations to represent the combined effect of the various gases. Typically, 
  only an annual 1% increase in CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent concentrations, which 
  approximates changes in radiative forcing of the IS92a emission scenario (Leggett 
  et al., 1992), has been used. However, between 10 and 40% of this increase results 
  from non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases (Alcamo et al., 1995). The assumption 
  that CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations equal CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent concentrations 
  (e.g., Schimel et al., 1997; Walker et al., 1999) has led to an exaggeration 
  of direct CO<sub>2</sub> effects. If impacts are to be assessed more consistently, 
  proper CO<sub>2</sub> concentration levels and CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent climate 
  forcing must be used. Many recent impact assessments that recognise these important 
  requirements (e.g., Leemans et al., 1998; Prinn et al., 1999; Downing et al., 
  2000) make use of tools such as scenario generators (see <a href="494.htm">Section 
  13.5.2.1</a>) that explicitly treat atmospheric trace gas concentrations. Moreover, 
  some recent AOGCM simulations now discriminate between the individual forcings 
  of different greenhouse gases (see <a href="338.htm">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 
  9.1</a>)</p>
<p>The biosphere is an important control in defining changes in greenhouse gas 
  concentrations. Its surface characteristics, such as albedo and surface roughness, 
  further influence climate patterns. Biospheric processes, such as CO<sub>2</sub>-sequestration 
  and release, evapotranspiration and land-cover change, are in turn affected 
  by climate. For example, warming is expected to result in a poleward expansion 
  of forests (IPCC, 1996b). This would increase biospheric carbon storage, which 
  lowers future CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and change the surface albedo which 
  would directly affect climate. A detailed discussion of the role of the biosphere 
  on climate can be found elsewhere (<a href="095.htm">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="260.htm">7</a>), 
  but there is a clear need for an improved treatment of biospheric responses 
  in scenarios that are designed for regional impact assessment. Some integrated 
  assessment models, which include simplifications of many key biospheric responses, 
  are beginning to provide consistent information of this kind (e.g., Alcamo et 
  al., 1996, 1998; Harvey et al., 1997; Xiao et al., 1997; Goudriaan et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Another important input to impact assessments is sea level rise. AOGCMs usually 
  calculate the thermal expansion of the oceans directly, but this is only one 
  component of sea level rise (see <a href="408.htm">Chapter 11</a>). Complete 
  calculations of sea level rise, including changes in the mass balance of ice 
  sheets and glaciers, can be made with simpler models (e.g., Raper et al., 1996), 
  and the transient dynamics of sea level rise should be explicitly calculated 
  because the responses are delayed (Warrick et al., 1996). However, the current 
  decoupling of important dynamic processes in most simple models could generate 
  undesirable inaccuracies in the resulting scenarios.</p>
<p>Climate scenario generators can comprehensively address some of these inconsistencies. 
  Full consistency, however, can only be attained through the use of fully coupled 
  global models (earth system models) that systematically account for all major 
  processes and their interactions, but these are still under development.</p>
