<h3><a name="112"></a>1.1.2 The Climate System</h3>
<p><i>Its components</i><br>
  The climate system, as defined in this Report, is an interactive system consisting 
  of five major components: the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the 
  land surface and the biosphere, forced or influenced by various external forcing 
  mechanisms, the most important of which is the Sun (see <a href="#fig11">Figure 
  1.1</a>). Also the direct effect of human activities on the climate system is 
  considered an external forcing.</p>

<p><a name="fig11"></a>The atmosphere is the most unstable and rapidly changing 
  part of the system. Its composition, which has changed with the evolution of 
  the Earth, is of central importance to the problem assessed in this Report. 
  The Earth's dry atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>, 
  78.1% volume mixing ratio), oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>, 20.9% volume mixing ratio, 
  and argon (Ar, 0.93% volume mixing ratio). These gases have only limited interaction 
  with the incoming solar radiation and they do not interact with the infrared 
  radiation emitted by the Earth. However there are a number of trace gases, such 
  as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide 
  (N<sub>2</sub>O) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), which do absorb and emit infrared 
  radiation. These so called greenhouse gases, with a total volume mixing ratio 
  in dry air of less than 0.1% by volume, play an essential role in the Earth's 
  energy budget. Moreover the atmosphere contains water vapour (H<sub>2</sub>O), 
  which is also a natural greenhouse gas. Its volume mixing ratio is highly variable, 
  but it is typically in the order of 1%. Because these greenhouse gases absorb 
  the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and emit infrared radiation up- 
  and downward, they tend to raise the temperature near the Earth's surface. 
  Water vapour, CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> also absorb solar short-wave 
  radiation.</p>
<p>The atmospheric distribution of ozone and its role in the Earth's energy 
  budget is unique. Ozone in the lower part of the atmosphere, the troposphere 
  and lower stratosphere, acts as a greenhouse gas. Higher up in the stratosphere 
  there is a natural layer of high ozone concentration, which absorbs solar ultra-violet 
  radiation. In this way this so-called ozone layer plays an essential role in 
  the stratosphere's radiative balance, at the same time filtering out this 
  potentially damaging form of radiation.</p>
<p>Beside these gases, the atmosphere also contains solid and liquid particles 
  (aerosols) and clouds, which interact with the incoming and outgoing radiation 
  in a complex and spatially very variable manner. The most variable component 
  of the atmosphere is water in its various phases such as vapour, cloud droplets, 
  and ice crystals. Water vapour is the strongest greenhouse gas. For these reasons 
  and because the transition between the various phases absorb and release much 
  energy, water vapour is central to the climate and its variability and change.<br>
  The hydrosphere is the component comprising all liquid surface and subterranean 
  water, both fresh water, including rivers, lakes and aquifers, and saline water 
  of the oceans and seas. Fresh water runoff from the land returning to the oceans 
  in rivers influences the ocean's composition and circulation. The oceans 
  cover approximately 70% of the Earth's surface. They store and transport 
  a large amount of energy and dissolve and store great quantities of carbon dioxide. 
  Their circulation, driven by the wind and by density contrasts caused by salinity 
  and thermal gradients (the so-called thermohaline circulation), is much slower 
  than the atmospheric circulation. Mainly due to the large thermal inertia of 
  the oceans, they damp vast and strong temperature changes and function as a 
  regulator of the Earth's climate and as a source of natural climate variability, 
  in particular on the longer time-scales.</p>
<p>The cryosphere, including the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, continental 
  glaciers and snow fields, sea ice and permafrost, derives its importance to 
  the climate system from its high reflectivity (albedo) for solar radiation, 
  its low thermal conductivity, its large thermal inertia and, especially, its 
  critical role in driving deep ocean water circulation. Because the ice sheets 
  store a large amount of water, variations in their volume are a potential source 
  of sea level variations (<a href="408.htm">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<p>Vegetation and soils at the land surface control how energy received from the 
  Sun is returned to the atmosphere. Some is returned as long-wave (infrared) 
  radiation, heating the atmosphere as the land surface warms. Some serves to 
  evaporate water, either in the soil or in the leaves of plants, bringing water 
  back into the atmosphere. Because the evaporation of soil moisture requires 
  energy, soil moisture has a strong influence on the surface temperature. The 
  texture of the land surface (its roughness) influences the atmosphere dynamically 
  as winds blow over the land's surface. Roughness is determined by both 
  topography and vegetation. Wind also blows dust from the surface into the atmosphere, 
  which interacts with the atmospheric radiation.</p>
<p>The marine and terrestrial biospheres have a major impact on the atmosphere's 
  composition. The biota influence the uptake and release of greenhouse gases. 
  Through the photosynthetic process, both marine and terrestrial plants (especially 
  forests) store significant amounts of carbon from carbon dioxide. Thus, the 
  biosphere plays a central role in the carbon cycle, as well as in the budgets 
  of many other gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide. Other biospheric emissions 
  are the so-called volatile organic compounds (VOC) which may have important 
  effects on atmospheric chemistry, on aerosol formation and therefore on climate. 
  Because the storage of carbon and the exchange of trace gases are influenced 
  by climate, feedbacks between climate change and atmospheric concentrations 
  of trace gases can occur. The influence of climate on the biosphere is preserved 
  as fossils, tree rings, pollen and other records, so that much of what is known 
  of past climates comes from such biotic indicators.</p>
<p><i>Interactions among the components</i><br>
  Many physical, chemical and biological interaction processes occur among the 
  various components of the climate system on a wide range of space and time scales, 
  making the system extremely complex. Although the components of the climate 
  system are very different in their composition, physical and chemical properties, 
  structure and behaviour, they are all linked by fluxes of mass, heat and momentum: 
  all subsystems are open and interrelated.</p>
<p>As an example, the atmosphere and the oceans are strongly coupled and exchange, 
  among others, water vapour and heat through evaporation. This is part of the 
  hydrological cycle and leads to condensation, cloud formation, precipitation 
  and runoff, and supplies energy to weather systems. On the other hand, precipitation 
  has an influence on salinity, its distribution and the thermohaline circulation. 
  Atmosphere and oceans also exchange, among other gases, carbon dioxide, maintaining 
  a balance by dissolving it in cold polar water which sinks into the deep ocean 
  and by outgassing in relatively warm upwelling water near the equator.</p>
<p>Some other examples: sea ice hinders the exchanges between atmosphere and oceans; 
  the biosphere influences the carbon dioxide concentration by photosynthesis 
  and respiration, which in turn is influenced by climate change. The biosphere 
  also affects the input of water in the atmosphere through evapotranspiration, 
  and the atmosphere's radiative balance through the amount of sunlight reflected 
  back to the sky (albedo).</p>
<p>These are just a few examples from a virtually inexhaustible list of complex 
  interactions some of which are poorly known or perhaps even unknown. <a href="260.htm">Chapter 
  7</a> provides an assessment of the present knowledge of physical climate processes 
  and feedbacks, whilst <a href="095.htm">Chapter 3</a> deals with biological 
  feedbacks.</p>
<p>Any change, whether natural or anthropogenic, in the components of the climate 
  system and their interactions, or in the external forcing, may result in climate 
  variations. The following sections introduce various aspects of natural climate 
  variations, followed by an introduction to the human influence on the climate 
  system.</p>
