<h2>7.4 Land-Surface Processes and Feedbacks</h2>
<p>The net radiation absorbed by the continents is partitioned mainly into sensible 
  and latent (evapotranspiration) heat fluxes whose release back into the atmosphere 
  directly influences local air temperature and humidity and thence other climate 
  system variables. In any given locale, soil moisture availability and vegetation 
  state largely determine the fraction of net radiation that is used for evapotranspiration, 
  as well as the photosynthetic and respiration rates. Thus, realistic modelling 
  of land surface-atmosphere interactions is essential to realistic prediction 
  of continental climate and hydrology. In doing this, attention must be paid 
  to the links between vegetation and the terrestrial energy, water and carbon 
  cycles, and how these might change due to eco-physiological responses to elevated 
  CO<sub>2</sub> and changes in land use.</p>
<h3><a name="741"></a>7.4.1 Land-Surface Parametrization (LSP) Development</h3>
<p>The exchanges of energy, momentum, water, heat and carbon between the land 
  surface and the atmosphere must be more realistically and accurately calculated 
  in the next generation of coupled models (Sellers et al., 1997). Fluxes of the 
  first four quantities, traditionally defined as physical climate system variables, 
  are routinely parametrized in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models and 
  climate models as functions of the surface albedo, aerodynamic roughness length 
  and surface "moisture availability" (Betts et al., 1998; Viterbo et 
  al., 1999). These land-surface properties can all be defined as functions of 
  the type and density of the local vegetation, and the depth and physical properties 
  of the soil. The first generation of land-surface parametrizations (LSPs) developed 
  in the 1970s took little account of these relationships, and were replaced by 
  biophysically realistic models, complete with supporting vegetation and soil 
  databases, which led to significant improvements in NWP and climate model performance 
  in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, these second generation models incorporated 
  only empirical descriptions of the evapotranspiration process, by which water 
  is taken up from the soil by plant roots and released into the atmosphere through 
  tiny pores in leaf surfaces called stomata, while CO<sub>2</sub> is drawn from 
  the atmosphere into leaf interiors for photosynthesis through these same stomata. 
  Research has shown that living plants appear to actively control stomatal widths 
  (conductance) in response to changes in water vapour and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  to optimise the ratio of water vapour losses to CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, and simple, 
  robust models of the photosynthesis-conductance system in plant leaves have 
  been constructed based on this idea, see <a href="291.htm#fig75">Figure 7.5</a> 
  (Farquhar et al., 1980; Collatz et al., 1991; Sellers et al., 1992a). These 
  models have been parametrized and verified at the leaf level, and can also be 
  scaled up to describe vegetation canopy processes at regional scales using satellite 
  data. These third generation LSPs, published in the late 1990s, thus combine 
  consistent descriptions of the physical climate system transfer processes for 
  energy, momentum, water and heat, with the biophysics of photosynthesis (Bonan, 
  1995; Sellers et al., 1996c; Dickinson et al., 1998). Why is this important?</p>
<p> Photosynthesis and respiration are climatically sensitive and exhibit interannual 
  variations following climate variations (Dai and Fung, 1993; Francey et al., 
  1995; Goulden et al., 1996; Myneni et al., 1997; Randerson et al., 1997; Xiao 
  et al., 1998; Randerson et al., 1999; Tian et al., 1999). Furthermore, there 
  appears to have been a net enhancement of terrestrial photosynthesis over respiration 
  over the last two decades, according to inverse modelling results (Tans et al., 
  1990; Ciais et al., 1995; Keeling et al., 1995; Denning et al., 1996a,b; Randerson 
  et al., 1999); and isotopic analyses (Fung et al., 1997). While disagreements 
  remain about the longitudinal distribution (Rayner and Law, 1999) and the processes 
  responsible for this uptake (Holland et al., 1997a; Field and Fung, 1999; Houghton 
  and Hackler, 1999), these results indicate that changes in the terrestrial carbon 
  balance could be a significant factor in determining future trajectories of 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and thus the rate and extent of global warming; 
  see further discussion in Chapter 3. The third generation LSPs have incorporated 
  advances in our understanding of how green plants function, how they alter isotopic 
  fractions of gases they come into contact with, and how they interact with radiation 
  to produce distinctive signatures that can be observed by remote sensing satellites 
  (Tucker et al., 1986; Sellers et al., 1992a; Myneni et al., 1995). As a result, 
  LSPs can now be used to calculate mutually consistent land-atmosphere fluxes 
  of energy, heat, water and carbon (Denning et al., 1996a,b; Randall et al., 
  1996).</p>
<p> Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance also exhibit strong diurnal variation, 
  and improved representation of this has led to better simulation of the diurnal 
  variation of surface heat and water fluxes and hence more realistic forcings 
  for boundary-layer dynamics and convection (Denning et al., 1996a; Randall et 
  al., 1996). These physiologically driven variations in the surface fluxes have 
  a direct influence on the diurnal surface air temperature range in continental 
  interiors and are directly sensitive to changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  (Collatz et al., 2000). Furthermore, increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is likely to 
  have a direct effect on vegetation stomatal function through feedbacks in the 
  photosynthesis-conductance system. Increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations allow vegetation 
  to maintain the same photosynthetic rate with a lower evapotranspiration rate. 
  In a recent GCM study, tropical photosynthesis and transpiration rates were 
  calculated to change only slightly under a CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 700 ppm, while 
  the additional surface net radiation due to global warming was mainly returned 
  to the atmosphere as sensible heat flux, boosting warming over the tropical 
  continents by 0.4 to 0.9&deg;C above the direct greenhouse warming of 1.7&deg;C 
  (Sellers et al., 1996a). It has been hypothesised that this effect may be partially 
  countered by increased vegetation growth (Betts et al., 1997), but it is not 
  clear to what extent this would be significant in already densely vegetated 
  areas such as the tropical forests. To what extent can we trust these new models 
  and their predictions?</p>
