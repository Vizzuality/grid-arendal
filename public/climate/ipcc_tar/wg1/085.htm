<h3>2.6.4 Monsoons </h3>
<p>Variations in the behaviour of the North African summer monsoon were highlighted 
  in IPCC (1990). Moron (1997) demonstrated that long-term variations of Sahel 
  annual rainfall, particularly the wet 1950s and the dry 1970 to 1980s, are seen 
  over the Guinea coast area, although trends are strongest in the Sahel. The 
  significant decrease in Guinea coast rainfall (Ward, 1998) is present in both 
  the first and second rainy seasons, but is strongest in the second. Janicot 
  et al. (1996) and Moron (1997) demonstrated that the moderate influence of ENSO 
  (towards drier conditions) has increased since 1960, with warm events associated 
  more strongly with large-scale anomalous dry conditions over the Guinea and 
  Sahel belts. Ward et al. (1999) show that the Sahel has become moderately wetter 
  since 1987, despite the increased drying influence of ENSO events, a trend that 
  continued to 1999 (Parker and Horton, 2000). This recent behaviour may be related 
  to a quasi-hemispheric variation of SST (e.g., Enfield and Mestas-Nu&ntilde;ez, 
  1999) shown to be related to Sahel rainfall by Folland et al. (1986), and which 
  may be related to the recent strong increase in North Atlantic SST mentioned 
  in <a href="055.htm#2222">Section 2.2.2.2</a>. Many other parts of tropical 
  Africa are influenced by ENSO towards either drier or wetter conditions than 
  normal, sometimes modulated by regional SST anomalies near Africa (e.g., Nicholson 
  and Kim, 1997; Nicholson, 1997; Indeje et al., 2000), but few trends can be 
  discerned. </p>
<p>Multi-decadal and decadal variations of the Indian monsoon have been widely 
  noted (e.g., Pant and Kumar, 1997) but links with El Ni&ntilde;o do not now 
  seem straightforward (Slingo et al., 1999). However, despite the recent strong 
  El Ni&ntilde;o episodes, the inverse relationship between the ENSO and the Indian 
  summer monsoon (weak monsoon arising from an ENSO event) has broken down in 
  the recent two decades (Kumar et al., 1999a). This link operated on multi-decadal 
  time-scales </p>
<p>with NINO 3 SST until at least 1970. Kumar et al. suggest that persistently 
  increased surface temperatures over Eurasia in winter and spring (<a href="057.htm#fig210">Figure 
  2.10</a>) have favoured an enhanced land-ocean thermal gradient conducive to 
  stronger monsoons; they also observe a shift away from India in the sinking 
  node of the Walker circulation in El Ni&ntilde;o. Changes have also occurred 
  in relationships with Indian monsoon precursors (Kumar et al., 1999b). One possibility 
  is that warming over the Indian Ocean (<a href="057.htm#fig29">Figures 2.9</a>, 
  <a href="057.htm#fig210">2.10</a>) may have increased moisture and rainfall 
  for a given state of the atmospheric circulation (Kitoh et al., 1997). There 
  may be a link to multi-decadal variations in Pacific SST, but this remains to 
  be investigated, together with other monsoon indices (e.g., Goswami et al., 
  1997). </p>
<p>It has been known for some time that the position of the western North Pacific 
  sub-tropical high affects the East Asian monsoon. Gong and Wang (1999a) showed 
  that summer (June to August) precipitation over central and eastern China near 
  30&deg;N is positively correlated with the intensity of the high, with negative 
  correlations to the north and south. A location of the sub-tropical high further 
  south than normal is conducive to heavy summer rainfall in this region. Time-series 
  of the sub-tropical high show an increase in areal extent in the 1920s, then 
  another increase from the mid-1970s to 1998, giving frequent wet summers in 
  this region in recent years. The north-east winter monsoon has also shown low-frequency 
  variations. Thus the strength of the Siberian high increased to a peak around 
  1968, and then weakened to a minimum around 1990 (Gong and Wang, 1999b), in 
  phase with the increased frequency of the positive phase of the NAO (Wallace, 
  2000 and next section). This is likely to have contributed to strong recent 
  winter warming in China shown in <a href="057.htm#fig210">Figure 2.10</a>. </p>
