<p><i>Glaciers and ice caps</i><br>
  To make projections for future loss of mass from glaciers and ice caps, we have 
  applied the methods of Gregory and Oerlemans (1998) and Van de Wal and Wild 
  (2001) (<a href="414.htm">Sections 11.2.2.2</a>, <a href="415.htm">11.2.2.4</a>) 
  to the seasonally and geographically dependent temperature changes given by 
  a range of AOGCM IS92a experiments including sulphate aerosols (<a href="427.htm#tab1112">Table 
  11.12</a>). We adjust the results to be consistent with the assumption that 
  the climate of 1865 to 1895 was 0.15 K warmer than the steady state for glaciers, 
  following Zuo and Oerlemans (1997) (see also <a href="428.htm">Section 11.4</a>). 
  Precipitation changes are not included, as they are not expected to have a strong 
  influence on the global average (<a href="414.htm#11223">Section 11.2.2.3</a>). 
</p>
<p>For constant glacier area, from the AOGCM IS92a experiments including sulphate 
  aerosol, predicted sea level rise from glacier melt over the hundred years 1990 
  to 2090 lies in the range 0.06 to 0.15 m. The variation is due to three factors. 
  First, the global average temperature change varies between models. A larger 
  temperature rise tends to give more melting, but they are not linearly related, 
  since the total melt depends on the time-integrated temperature change. Second, 
  the global mass balance sensitivity to temperature change varies among AOGCMs 
  because of their different seasonal and regional distribution of temperature 
  change. Third, the glaciers are already adjusting to climate change during the 
  20th century, and any such imbalance will persist during the 21st century, in 
  addition to the further imbalance due to future climate change. The global average 
  temperature change and glacier mass balance sensitivity may not be independent 
  factors, since both are affected by regional climate feedbacks. The sensitivity 
  and the present imbalance are related factors, because a larger sensitivity 
  implies a greater present imbalance.</p>
<p>With glacier area contracting as the volume reduces, the estimated sea level 
  rise contribution is in the range 0.05 to 0.11 m, about 25% less than if constant 
  area is assumed, similar to the findings of Oerlemans et al. (1998) and Van 
  de Wal and Wild (2001). The time-dependence of glacier area means the results 
  can no longer be represented by a global glacier mass balance sensitivity. </p>
<p>Glaciers and ice caps on the margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets 
  are omitted from these calculations, because they are included in the ice sheet 
  projections below. These ice masses have a large area (<a href="412.htm#tab113">Table 
  11.3</a>), but experience little ablation on account of being in very cold climates. 
  Van de Wal and Wild (2001) find that the Greenland marginal glaciers contribute 
  an additional 6% to glacier melt in a scenario of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling over 
  70 years. Similar calculations using the AOGCM IS92a results give a maximum 
  contribution of 14 mm for 1990 to 2100. For the Antarctic marginal glaciers, 
  the ambient temperatures are too low for there to be any significant surface 
  runoff. Increasing temperatures will increase the runoff and enlarge the area 
  experiencing ablation, but their contribution is very likely to remain small. 
  For instance, Drewry and Morris (1992) calculate a contribution of 0.012 mm/yr/&deg;C 
  to the global glacier mass balance sensitivity from the glacier area of 20,000 
  km<sup>2</sup> which currently experiences some melting on the Antarctic Peninsula.</p>

<p><i>Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets</i><br>
  To make projections of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet mass changes consistent 
  with the IS92a AOGCM experiments including sulphate aerosols, we have integrated 
  the ice-sheet model of Huybrechts and De Wolde (1999) using boundary conditions 
  of temperature and precipitation derived by perturbing present day climatology 
  according to the geographically and seasonally dependent pattern changes predicted 
  by the T106 ECHAM4 model (Wild and Ohmura, 2000) for a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>. 
  To generate time-dependent boundary conditions, these patterns were scaled with 
  the area average changes over the ice sheets as a function of time for each 
  AOGCM experiment using a method similar to that described by Huybrechts et al. 
  (1999). The marginal glaciers and ice caps on Greenland and Antarctica were 
  included in the ice sheet area. The calculated contributions from these small 
  ice masses have some uncertainty resulting from the limited spatial resolution 
  of the ice sheet model.</p>
<p>For 1990 to 2090 in the AOGCM GS experiments, Greenland contributes 0.01 to 
  0.03 m and Antarctica -0.07 to -0.01 m to global average sea level (<a href="427.htm#tab1113">Table 
  11.13</a>). Note that these sea level contributions result solely from recent 
  and projected future climate change; they do not include the response to past 
  climate change (discussed in <a href="417.htm">Sections 11.2.3.3</a> and <a href="423.htm#1131">11.3.1</a>).<br>
  Mass balance sensitivities are derived by regressing rate of change of mass 
  against global or local temperature change (note that they include the effect 
  of precipitation changes) (<a href="427.htm#tab1113">Table 11.13</a>). The Greenland 
  local sensitivities are smaller than some of the values reported previously 
  from other methods (<a href="418.htm">Section 11.2.3.4</a> and <a href="418.htm#tab117">Table 
  11.7</a>) and by Warrick et al. (1996) because of the larger precipitation increases 
  and the seasonality of temperature changes (less increase in summer) predicted 
  by AOGCMs, and the smaller temperature rise in the ablation zone (as compared 
  to the ice-sheet average) projected by the T106 ECHAM4 time slice results. The 
  Antarctic sensitivities are less negative than those in <a href="418.htm#tab117">Table 
  11.7</a> because the AOGCMs predict smaller precipitation increases.</p>
<p>The use of a range of AOGCMs represents the uncertainty in modelling changing 
  circulation patterns, which lead to both changes in temperature and precipitation, 
  as noted by Kapsner et al. (1995) and Cuffey and Clow (1997) from the results 
  from Greenland ice cores. The range of AOGCM thermodynamic and circulation responses 
  gives a range of 4 to 8%/&deg;C for Greenland precipitation increases, generally 
  less than indicated by ice-cores for the glacial-interglacial transition, but 
  more than for Holocene variability (<a href="418.htm">Section 11.2.3.4</a>). 
  If precipitation did not increase at all with greenhouse warming, Greenland 
  local sensitivities would be larger, by 0.05 to 0.1 mm/yr/&deg;C (see also <a href="418.htm#tab117">Table 
  11.7</a>). Given that all AOGCMs agree on an increase, but differ on the strength 
  of the relationship, we include an uncertainty of &plusmn;0.02 mm/yr/&deg;C 
  in <a href="412.htm#tab113">Table 11.13</a> on the Greenland local sensitivities, 
  being the product of the standard deviation of precipitation increase (1.5%/&deg;C) 
  and the current Greenland accumulation (1.4 mm/yr sea level equivalent, <a href="415.htm#tab115">Table 
  11.5</a>).</p>
<p>Estimates of Greenland runoff (<a href="415.htm#tab115">Table 11.5</a>) have 
  a standard error of about &plusmn; 10%. This reflects uncertainty in the degree-day 
  method (Braithwaite, 1995) and refreezing parametrization (Janssens and Huybrechts, 
  2000) used to calculate Greenland ablation. Given that a typical size of the 
  sensitivity of ablation to temperature change is 0.3 mm/yr/&deg;C (<a href="418.htm#tab117">Table 
  11.7</a>), we adopt an additional uncertainty of &plusmn; 0.03 mm/yr/&deg;C 
  for the local Greenland sensitivities in <a href="427.htm#tab1113">Table 11.13</a>. 
  We include a separate uncertainty of the same size to reflect the possible sensitivity 
  to use of different high-resolution geographical patterns of temperature and 
  precipitation change (the T106 ECHAM4 pattern was the only one available). As 
  an estimate of the uncertainty related to changes in iceberg discharge and area-elevation 
  distribution, we ascribe an uncertainty of &plusmn; 10% to the net mass change, 
  on the basis of the magnitude of the dynamic response for Greenland described 
  in <a href="418.htm">Section 11.2.3.4</a>.<br>
  For Antarctica, uncertainty introduced by ablation model parameters need not 
  be considered because melting remains very small for the temperature scenarios 
  considered for the 21st century. Ice-dynamical uncertainties are much more difficult 
  to determine. See <a href="435.htm#11543">Section 11.5.4.3</a> for a detailed 
  discussion. We include an uncertainty of 0.08 mm/yr/&deg;C on the local sensitivity, 
  which is its inter-model standard deviation, to reflect the spread of precipitation 
  changes as a function of temperature.</p>
<p><i>Total</i><br>
  To obtain predictions of global average sea level rise for 1990-2100 for the 
  IS92a scenario with sulphate aerosols, we calculate the sum of the contributions 
  from thermal expansion, glaciers and ice sheets for each AOGCM, and add the 
  0 to 0.5 mm/yr from the continuing evolution of the ice sheets in response to 
  past climate change (<a href="416.htm#11231">Section 11.2.3.1</a>) and smaller 
  terms from thawing of permafrost (<a href="421.htm">Section 11.2.5</a>) and 
  the effect of sedimentation (<a href="422.htm">Section 11.2.6</a>). The range 
  of our results is 0.11 to 0.77 m (<a href="428.htm#tab1114">Table 11.14</a>, 
  <a href="428.htm#fig1111">Figure 11.11</a>), which should be compared with the 
  range of 0.20 to 0.86 m given by Warrick et al. (1996) (SAR Section 7.5.2.4, 
  Figure 7.7) for the same scenario. The AOGCMs have a range of effective climate 
  sensitivities from 1.4 to 4.2&deg;C (<a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a>), 
  similar to the range of 1.5 to 4.5&deg;C used by Warrick et al. The AOGCM thermal 
  expansion values are generally larger than those of Warrick et al. (SAR Section 
  7.5.2.4, Figure 7.8), but the other terms are mostly smaller (i.e., more negative 
  in the case of Antarctica).</p>
<p>Warrick et al. included a positive term to allow for the possible instability 
  of the WAIS. We have omitted this because it is now widely agreed that major 
  loss of grounded ice and accelerated sea level rise are very unlikely during 
  the 21st century (<a href="435.htm">Section 11.5.4.3</a>). The size of our range 
  is an indication of the systematic uncertainty in modelling radiative forcing, 
  climate and sea level changes. Uncertainties in modelling the carbon cycle and 
  atmospheric chemistry are not covered by this range, because the AOGCMs are 
  all given similar atmospheric concentrations as input.</p>
