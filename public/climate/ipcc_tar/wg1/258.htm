<h2>Appendix 6.1 Elements of Radiative Forcing Concept </h2>
<p>The principal elements of the radiative forcing concept are summarised below.</p>
<p>(A) The concept was developed first in the context of the one-dimensional radiative-convective 
  models that investigated the equilibrated global, annual mean surface temperature 
  responses to radiative perturbations caused by changes in the concentrations 
  of radiatively active species (Manabe and Wetherald, 1967; Ramanathan and Coakley, 
  1978; WMO, 1986). Over the past decade, the concept has been extended to cover 
  different spatial dimensions and seasonal time-scales (IPCC, 1992, 1994).</p>
<p>(B) In the one-dimensional radiative-convective model framework, the surface 
  and troposphere are closely coupled, behaving as a single thermodynamic system 
  under the joint control of radiative and convective processes, with a specified 
  lapse rate determining the thermal structure. The stratospheric state is determined 
  by the radiative equilibrium condition. The stratosphere and troposphere irradiances 
  are together constrained by the requirement that the top of the atmosphere net 
  total irradiance (i.e., radiative energy absorbed minus that emitted by the 
  Earth's entire climate system) must be zero at equilibrium. In applying 
  the forcing concept to arbitrary spatial and seasonal time-scales, as opposed 
  to the global annual mean, it has been assumed (WMO, 1992; SAR) that the stratosphere 
  is in radiative-dynamical (rather than radiative) equilibrium (see (D) below).</p>
<p>(C) The stratosphere is a fast response system which, in response to an imposed 
  radiative perturbation, comes into equilibrium on a time-scale (about a few 
  months) that is much more rapid than the surface-troposphere system (typically 
  decades) (Hansen et al., 1997a; Shine and Forster, 1999). The latter is a slow 
  response system owing principally to the thermal inertia of the oceans.</p>
<p>(D) When a perturbation is applied (such as increases in well-mixed greenhouse 
  gases), there is an instantaneous change in irradiances that is manifest in 
  general as a radiative imbalance (forcing) at the surface, tropopause and the 
  top of the atmosphere. The rapid thermal re-equilibration of the stratosphere 
  leads to an alteration of the radiative imbalance imposed on the surface-troposphere 
  system (WMO, 1992), thereby yielding an adjusted forcing (SAR). The surface 
  and troposphere, operating in a slow response mode, are still in a process of 
  adjustment while the stratosphere has already reached its new equilibrium state. 
  The SAR points out the clear distinction existing between the instantaneous 
  and adjusted forcings. </p>
<p>For the arbitrary space and time mean stratosphere, there arises the need to 
  evaluate the radiative flux changes with the stratosphere in a radiative-dynamical 
  equilibrium. A classical method to determine this is the "Fixed Dynamical 
  Heating" (FDH; WMO, 1995) in which it is assumed that the dynamical heating 
  rate in the stratosphere is unchanged and that the stratosphere comes to a new 
  thermal equilibrium in response to the perturbation through adjustments in the 
  temperature profile, such that a new radiative-dynamical equilibrium is attained 
  (radiative response; see Ramanathan and Dickinson (1979) and Fels et al. (1980)). 
  The resulting adjustment process in the stratosphere makes an additional contribution 
  to the forcing of the surface-troposphere system. When the stratosphere has 
  adjusted to a new radiative-dynamical equilibrium with resultant changes to 
  its thermal state, the change in flux at the tropopause and at the top of the 
  atmosphere become identical. It is important that the stratosphere be in radiative-dynamical 
  equilibrium and, as shown by Hansen et al. (1997a), it is the adjusted rather 
  than the instantaneous forcing that is a more relevant indicator of the surface 
  temperature response. The adjustment of stratosphere is crucial for some of 
  the forcings, but not for all of them (Shine and Forster, 1999). In the case 
  of some radiative perturbations, the stratosphere is hardly perturbed and the 
  instantaneous and adjusted radiative flux changes thus tend to be similar (SAR). 
  In other cases, there is only a small (20% or less) influence due to the stratospheric 
  adjustment process. However, for the case of ozone depletion in the lower stratosphere, 
  the effect of a strato-spheric adjustment could even yield a change in the sign 
  of the forcing.</p>
<p>(E) As a direct consequence of the above, the forcing definition most appropriate 
  for the response of the surface-troposphere system to a radiative perturbation 
  is the net (down minus up) radiative (solar plus long-wave) change defined at 
  the tropopause after the stratosphere has come to a new thermal equilibrium 
  state. Thus, the level at which the tropopause is assumed in the models is an 
  important aspect for the quantitative determination of the forcing (Forster 
  et al., 1997), as is the model vertical resolution used to resolve the vicinity 
  of the tropopause region (Shine et al., 1995). The classical radiative-convective 
  model definition of the tropopause considers it as a boundary between a region 
  where radiative-convective equilibrium prevails (i.e., troposphere) and a region 
  that is in radiative (or radiative-dynamical, i.e., stratosphere) equilibrium. 
  Such a distinction could be ambiguous in the case of the three-dimensional GCMs 
  or the real world. However, radiative forcing appears to be relatively robust 
  to changes in the definition of the tropopause in a GCM (Christiansen, 1999).</p>
<p>(F) A major motivation for the radiative forcing concept is the ease of climate 
  change analysis when radiative forcing, feedback, and climate response are distinguished 
  from one another. Such a separation is possible in the modelling framework where 
  forcing and feedback can be evaluated separately e.g., for the case of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling 
  effects (see Dickinson, 1982; Dickinson and Cicerone, 1986; Cess and Potter, 
  1988; Cess et al., 1993). The consideration of forcing, feedback and response 
  as three distinct entities in the modelling framework (see also Charlson, 2000) 
  while originating from the one-dimensional radiative/convective models, has 
  made the transition to GCM studies of climate (Hansen et al., 1981; Wetherald 
  and Manabe, 1988; Chen and Ramaswamy, 1996a). </p>
<p>(G) A critical aspect of the separability mentioned in (F) is holding the surface 
  and troposphere state fixed in the evaluation of the radiative forcing. For 
  example, in the case of a change in the concentration of a radiatively active 
  species, the term "state" implies that all parameters are held at 
  the unperturbed values with only the concerned species' concentration being 
  changed. Thus, in the strictest sense, temperature in the troposphere, water 
  vapour and clouds in the entire atmosphere, and circulation, are held fixed 
  in the computation of the irradiance changes at the tropopause, with only the 
  stratosphere adjusted to a new thermal equilibrium state via the radiative response. 
  In contrast to this prescription for calculating the forcing, the resulting 
  changes in the meteorological and climatic parameters (e.g., tropospheric temperature 
  and water vapour) constitute responses to the imposed perturbation (WMO, 1986; 
  Charlson, 2000). In the IPCC context, the change in a radiative agent's 
  characteristic has involved anthropogenic (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>) and natural (e.g., aerosols 
  after a volcanic eruption) perturbations.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that changes in water vapour in the troposphere 
  are viewed as a feedback variable rather than a forcing agent. However, in the 
  case of the second indirect aerosol forcing, the separation is less distinct. 
  Anthropogenic emissions (e.g., aircraft, fossil fuel) or precursors to water 
  vapour are negligible. The same is true for changes in water vapour in the stratosphere, 
  except in the instance that the oxidation of CH<sub>4</sub> provides an input. Changes 
  in the condensed liquid and solid phases of water (i.e., clouds) are also considered 
  as part of the climate feedback. The strict requirement of no feedbacks in the 
  surface and troposphere demands that no secondary effects such as changes in 
  troposphere motions or its thermodynamic state, or dynamically-induced changes 
  in water substance in the surface and atmosphere, be included in the evaluation 
  of the net irradiance change at the tropopause. (Note: the second indirect effect 
  of aerosols consists of microphysically-induced changes in the water substance.)</p>
<p>(H) The foregoing governing factors reflect the fundamental recognition that, 
  in response to an externally imposed radiative forcing, there is a shift in 
  the equilibrium state of the climate system. This forcing of the climate change 
  in the IPCC parlance is to be distinguished from forcing definitions initiated 
  for other purposes, e.g., cloud forcing (Ramanathan et al., 1989), sea surface 
  temperature related forcing during ENSO periods, etc.</p>
