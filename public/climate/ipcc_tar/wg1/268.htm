<h4>7.2.1.1 Water vapour feedback</h4>
<p>Water vapour feedback continues to be the most consistently important feedback 
  accounting for the large warming predicted by general circulation models in 
  response to a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>. Water vapour feedback acting alone approximately 
  doubles the warming from what it would be for fixed water vapour (Cess et al., 
  1990; Hall and Manabe, 1999; Schneider et al., 1999; Held and Soden, 2000). 
  Furthermore, water vapour feedback acts to amplify other feedbacks in models, 
  such as cloud feedback and ice albedo feedback. If cloud feedback is strongly 
  positive, the water vapour feedback can lead to 3.5 times as much warming as 
  would be the case if water vapour concentration were held fixed (Hall and Manabe, 
  1999).</p>
<p> As noted by Held and Soden (2000), the relative sensitivity of OLR to water 
  vapour changes at various locations depends on how one perturbs the water vapour 
  profile; the appropriate choice depends entirely on the nature of the water 
  vapour perturbation anticipated in a changing climate. The sensitivity is also 
  affected by cloud radiative effects, which tend to mask the influence of sub-cloud 
  water vapour on OLR. Incorporating cloud radiative effects and a fixed relative 
  humidity perturbation (argued to be most appropriate to diagnosing GCM water 
  vapour feedback), Held and Soden suggest that OLR is almost uniformly sensitive 
  to water vapour perturbations throughout the tropics. Roughly 55% of the total 
  is due to the free troposphere in the "tropics" (30&deg;N to 30&deg;S) 
  with 35% from the extra-tropics. Allowing for polar amplification of warming 
  increases the proportion of water vapour feedback attributable to the extra-tropics. 
  Of the tropical contribution, about two thirds, or 35% of the global total, 
  is due to the upper half of the troposphere, from 100 to 500 mb. The boundary 
  layer itself accounts for only 10% of the water vapour feedback globally. Simulations 
  incorporating cloud radiative effects in a doubled CO<sub>2</sub> experiment (Schneider 
  et al., 1999) and a clear-sky analysis based on 15 years of global data (Allan 
  et al., 1999) yield maximum sensitivity to water vapour fluctuations in the 
  400 to 700 mb layer (see also Le Treut et al., 1994). In a simulation analysed 
  by Schneider et al. (1999) extra-tropical water vapour feedback affected warming 
  50% more than did tropical feedback.</p>
<p> Most of the free troposphere is highly undersaturated with respect to water, 
  so that local water-holding capacity is not the limiting factor determining 
  atmospheric water vapour. Within the constraints imposed by Clausius-Clapeyron 
  alone there is ample scope for water vapour feedbacks either stronger or weaker 
  than those implied by constant relative humidity, especially in connection with 
  changes in the area of the moist tropical convective region (Pierrehumbert, 
  1999). It has been estimated that, without changes in the relative area of convective 
  and dry regions, a shift of water vapour to lower levels in the dry regions 
  could, at the extreme, lead to a halving of the currently estimated water vapour 
  feedback, but could not actually cause it to become a negative, stabilising 
  feedback (Harvey, 2000).</p>
<p> Attempts to directly confirm the water vapour feedback by correlating spatial 
  surface fluctuations with spatial OLR fluctuations were carried out by Raval 
  and Ramanathan (1989). Their results are difficult to interpret, as they involve 
  the effects of circulation changes as well as direct thermodynamic control (Bony 
  et al., 1995). Inamdar and Ramanathan (1998) showed that a positive correlation 
  between water vapour, greenhouse effect and SST holds for the entire tropics 
  at seasonal time-scales. This is consistent with a positive water vapour feedback, 
  but it still cannot be taken as a direct test of the feedback as the circulation 
  fluctuates in a different way over the seasonal cycle than it does in response 
  to doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
