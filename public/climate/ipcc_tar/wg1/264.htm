<h3>7.1.2 New Results since the SAR</h3>
<p>Improved atmospheric and oceanic modules of coupled climate models, especially 
  improved representation of clouds, parametrizations of boundary layer and ocean 
  mixing, and increased grid resolution, have helped reduce and often eliminate 
  the need for flux adjustment in some coupled climate models. This has not reduced 
  the range of sensitivities in projection experiments.</p>
<p> There is a growing appreciation of the importance of the stratosphere, particularly 
  the lower stratosphere, in the climate system. Since the mass of the stratosphere 
  represents only about 10 to 20% of the atmospheric mass, the traditional view 
  has been that the stratosphere can play only a limited role in climate change. 
  However, this view is changing. The transport and distribution of radiatively 
  active constituents, especially water vapour and ozone, are important for radiative 
  forcing. Moreover, waves generated in the troposphere propagate into the stratosphere 
  and are absorbed, so that stratospheric changes alter where and how they are 
  absorbed, and effects can extend downward into the troposphere.</p>
<p> Observational records suggest that the atmosphere may exhibit specific regimes 
  which characterise the climate on a regional to hemispheric scale. Climate change 
  may thus manifest itself both as shifting means as well as changing preference 
  of specific regimes. Examples are the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, 
  which shows a bias toward positive values for the last 30 years, and the climate 
  "shift" in the tropical Pacific at around 1976.</p>
<p> While considerable advances have been made in improving feedbacks and coupled 
  processes and their depiction in models, the emergence of the role of natural 
  modes of the climate system such as the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation 
  (ENSO) and NAO as key determinants of regional climate change, and possibly 
  also shifts, has led to an increase in uncertainty in those aspects of climate 
  change that critically depend on regional changes. It is encouraging that the 
  most advanced models exhibit natural variability that resembles the most important 
  modes such as ENSO and NAO.</p>
<p>The coupled ocean-atmosphere system contains important non-linearities which 
  give rise to a multiplicity of states of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation 
  (THC). Most climate models respond to global warming by a reduction of the Atlantic 
  THC. A complete shut-down of the THC in response to continued warming cannot 
  be excluded and would occur if certain thresholds are crossed. Models have identified 
  the maximum strength of greenhouse gas induced forcing and the rate of increase 
  as thresholds for the maintenance of the THC in the Atlantic ocean, an important 
  process influencing the climate of the Northern Hemisphere. While such thresholds 
  have been found in a variety of fundamentally different models, suggesting that 
  their existence in the climate system is a robust result, we cannot yet determine 
  with accuracy the values of these thresholds, because they crucially depend 
  on the response of the atmospheric hydrological cycle to climate change.</p>
<p>The representation of sea-ice dynamics and sub-grid scale processes in coupled 
  models has improved significantly, which is an important prerequisite for a 
  better understanding of, the current variability in, and a more accurate prediction 
  of future changes in polar sea-ice cover and atmosphere-ocean interaction in 
  areas of deep water formation. </p>
<p>Recent model simulations, including new land-surface parametrizations and field 
  observations, strongly indicate that large-scale changes in land use can lead 
  to significant impacts on the regional climate. The terrestrial carbon and water 
  cycles are also linked through vegetation physiology, which regulates the ratio 
  of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) uptake (photosynthesis) to water loss (evapotranspiration). 
  As a result, vegetation water-use efficiency is likely to change with increasing 
  atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, leading to a reduction in evapotranspiration over densely vegetated 
  areas. Tropical deforestation, in particular, is associated with local warming 
  and drying. However, realistic land-use change scenarios for the next 50 to 
  100 years are not expected to give rise to global scale climate changes comparable 
  to those resulting from greenhouse gas warming.</p>
