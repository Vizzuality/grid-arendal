<h3>7.3.6 Horizontal Circulation and Boundary Currents</h3>
<p>The horizontal circulation in ocean gyres contributes to the meridional transports 
  of heat and fresh water in the climate system (see <a href="300.htm">Section 
  7.6.2</a>), and therefore is of immediate relevance for climate change. Much 
  of that transport occurs through Western Boundary Currents (WBCs) such as the 
  Gulf Stream, Kuroshio, Agulhas Current and others which are prominent elements 
  of the ocean circulation. These currents are mainly driven by the wind, and 
  have a typical width of 50 km. Once a WBC has left the continental slope, it 
  is characterised by recirculation regimes and strong mesoscale variability. 
  The dynamical influence of the WBCs on the less vigorous interior circulation 
  is not fully understood. Their pathways are, however, crucial in determining 
  the location of the sub-polar front which separates the warm waters of the sub-tropics 
  from the colder sub-polar waters. The lower branch of the THC is also dominated 
  by deep WBCs. In the Atlantic, these are concentrated within 30 km of the continental 
  slope, and are accompanied by substantial recirculation and variability (Lee 
  et al., 1996).</p>
<p> The width and strength of boundary currents in climate models are very sensitive 
  to resolution, they become stronger and narrower as the resolution is increased, 
  provided that at the same time the sub-grid scale transports are also reduced. 
  For example, a recent simulation for the North Atlantic using a grid resolution 
  of 1/10&deg; (equivalent to 11 km or better) indicates that features such as 
  the width, location and variability of boundary currents, the eddy field and 
  its statistics, as well as regional current features are in rather good agreement 
  with observations (Smith et al., 2000). On the other hand, in non-eddy-resolving 
  climate models, boundary currents are quite unrealistic, they lack the observed 
  sharp fronts and recirculation regimes and hence miss the associated air-sea 
  heat fluxes and their dynamical influence on mid-ocean circulation. The effect 
  of having weaker and wider boundary currents for the model's climate and 
  climate sensitivity has so far not been systematically evaluated.</p>

        changes in SST due to changes in the advection of heat. This loop may 
        give rise to oscillations. The second loop (right) is due to the influence 
        of advection of low latitude salty waters into the areas of deep water 
        formation. The resulting correlation is positive and the loop may therefore 
        cause instabilities.</i></p>

<p><a name="fig74"></a>In the Atlantic Ocean, the THC is responsible for the relatively 
  mild climate in Western Europe (see Section 7.6.1). While palaeo-oceanographic 
  analyses suggest that the Atlantic THC has been relatively stable for the last 
  8,000 years, a series of large and rapid climatic changes during the last Ice 
  Age has been reconstructed from numerous palaeoclimatic archives (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 
  2</a>, <a href="072.htm">Section 2.4</a>). Based on the presently available 
  evidence, these changes are best explained by major reorganisations involving 
  the THC (Broecker, 1997; Stocker and Marchal, 2000). Changes of the THC, due 
  to natural variability or slowly changing surface forcing, thus have an important 
  effect on the climate on a regional to hemispheric scale, and numerous model 
  studies since the SAR have investigated potential changes in THC and elucidated 
  the underlying mechanisms and their impact on the climate system.</p>
<p>Generally, in high latitudes the ocean loses heat and gains fresh water (precipitation 
  and continental runoff) which has opposite effects on the density of ocean water. 
  In addition, the density of sea water is influenced by the supply of warm and 
  salty water from the low latitudes which constitutes the positive feedback maintaining 
  the Atlantic THC (<a href="#fig74">Figure 7.4</a>). This balance is influenced 
  by the surface fluxes of heat and fresh water, i.e., precipitation, evaporation, 
  continental runoff and sea-ice formation, all processes that are likely to change 
  in the future. Some models also suggest an influence of Southern Ocean wind 
  on the Atlantic THC (Toggweiler and Samuels, 1995).</p>
<p> The response of the THC to a perturbation depends on the relative strength 
  of further feedbacks. Reduced convection and advective heat transport into a 
  region lead to colder SSTs which counteracts the effect of salinity on density 
  and thus limits the strength of the destabilising oceanic feedbacks (<a href="#fig74">Figure 
  7.4</a>). The atmospheric heat transport compensates for parts of the changes 
  in ocean heat transport and is a key factor in determining the stability of 
  the THC (Zhang et al., 1993; Mikolajewicz and Maier-Reimer, 1994). Atmospheric 
  moisture transport among basins provides another feedback (Schiller et al., 
  1997). Model results suggest that in the presence of overflow between Greenland 
  and Iceland the THC is not very sensitive to changes in the atmosphere-ocean 
  fluxes (Lohmann and Gerdes, 1998).</p>
<p> It is likely that sea ice also has an effect on the stability of the THC: 
  decreased THC and hence oceanic heat transport leads to more sea ice formation 
  (Schiller et al., 1997). Formation of sea-ice tends to increase the density 
  of sea water both through brine rejection and cooling of the overlying air via 
  increased surface albedo and enhanced insulation. Increased export of sea ice 
  from these areas represents a significant fresh water transport over long distances 
  which can decrease deep water formation, thus representing a positive feedback. 
  A reliable estimate of the net effect of sea ice on the stability of the THC 
  is hampered by the still crude representation of sea ice in most current climate 
  models and the resulting unrealistic simulation of sea-ice distributions. A 
  negative feedback contributing to a stabilisation of the THC was recently proposed 
  by Latif et al. (2000). They suggested that during El Ni&ntilde;o conditions 
  fresh water export from the tropical Atlantic via the atmosphere is enhanced; 
  this tendency is also found in observations (Schmittner et al., 2000). This 
  implies an increased supply of saltier waters towards the northern North Atlantic 
  which facilitates deep water formation, hence a stabilising process for the 
  THC; the opposite effect occurs for La Ni&ntilde;a conditions.<br>
