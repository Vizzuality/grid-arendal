<h3>4.2.4 Tropospheric O<sub>3</sub></h3>
<p>Tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> is a direct greenhouse gas. The past increase in 
  tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> is estimated to provide the third largest increase 
  in direct radiative forcing since the pre-industrial era. In addition, through 
  its chemical impact on OH, it modifies the lifetimes of other greenhouse gases, 
  such as CH<sub>4</sub>. Its budget, however, is much more difficult to derive 
  than that of a long-lived gas for several reasons. Ozone abundances in the troposphere 
  typically vary from less than 10 ppb over remote tropical oceans up to about 
  100 ppb in the upper troposphere, and often exceed 100 ppb downwind of polluted 
  metropolitan regions. This variability, reflecting its rapid chemical turnover, 
  makes it impossible to determine the tropospheric burden from the available 
  surface sites, and we must rely on infrequent and sparsely sited profiles from 
  ozone sondes (e.g., Logan, 1999). The total column of ozone is measured from 
  satellites, and these observations have been used to infer the tropospheric 
  ozone column after removing the much larger stratospheric column (e.g., Fishman 
  and Brackett, 1997; Hudson and Thompson, 1998; Ziemke et al., 1998). The current 
  burden of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> is about 370 Tg(O<sub>3</sub>), which is 
  equivalent to a globally averaged column density of 34 DU (Dobson Units, 1 DU 
  = 2.687<img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/grid-arendal-website/production/static/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/times.gif" width="8" height="8">10<sup>16</sup> molecules/cm<sup>-2</sup>) 
  or a mean abundance of about 50 ppb, see <a href="#tab49">Table 4.9</a>.</p>

        about +4 DU global increase in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> alone (see <a href="151.htm#tab411">Table

      <p><b><sup>a</sup></b> Early observations are difficult to interpret and 
        do not provide coverage needed to derive the tropospheric burden of O<sub>3</sub> 
        (see Harris <i>et al.</i>, 1997). The change in burden is derived here 
        by shifting tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> uniformly in altitude to give 10 
        ppb at the surface in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes and 20 ppb at 
        surface in Northern Hemisphere tropics (implies 10 DU), or by additionally 
        reducing Southern Hemisphere tropics to 20 ppb and Southern Hemisphere 
        mid-latitudes to 25 ppb at the surface (13 DU).<br>

<p> The sources and sinks of tropospheric ozone are even more difficult to quantify 
  than the burden. Influx of stratospheric air is a source of about 475 Tg(O<sub>3</sub>)/yr 
  based on observed correlations with other gases (Murphy and Fahey, 1994; McLinden 
  et al., 2000). The in situ photochemical sources are predicted to be many times 
  larger, but are nearly balanced by equally large in situ chemical sinks (see 
  discussion on CTM modelling of tropo-spheric O<sub>3</sub> in <a href="148.htm#44">Sections 
  4.4</a> and <a href="154.htm">4.5</a>, <a href="156.htm#tab412">Table 4.12</a>). 
  Photochemical production of ozone is tied to the abundance of pollutants and 
  thus varies widely over a range of spatial scales, the most important of which 
  (e.g., biomass burning plumes, urban plumes, aircraft corridors, and convective 
  outflows) are not well represented in most global CTMs and cannot be quantified 
  globally with regional models. The dominant photochemical sinks for tropospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub> are the catalytic destruction cycle involving the HO<sub>2</sub> 
  + O<sub>3</sub> reaction and photolytic destruction by pathways involving the 
  reaction of O(<sup>1</sup>D), a product of O<sub>3</sub> photodissociation. 
  The other large sink, comparable in magnitude to the stratospheric source, is 
  surface loss mainly to vegetation. Another loss of O<sub>3</sub> is observed 
  under certain conditions in the polar marine boundary layer, notably at the 
  end of Arctic winter. It indicates reactions involving halogen radicals and 
  aerosols (Oum et al., 1998; Dickerson et al., 1999; Impey et al., 1999; Platt 
  and Moortgat, 1999; Prados et al., 1999; Vogt et al., 1999). The contribution 
  of these processes to the global budget is not yet quantified, but is probably 
  small. </p>
<p>Atmospheric measurement campaigns, both at surface sites and with aircraft, 
  have focused on simultaneous observations of the many chemical species involved 
  in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> production. Primary areas of O<sub>3</sub> production 
  are the mid-latitude industrialised and tropical biomass burning regions. For 
  example, the North Atlantic Regional Experiment (NARE) and the Atmosphere Ocean 
  Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE) showed that the prevailing westerly winds typically 
  carry large quantities of ozone and precursors from the eastern USA over the 
  North Atlantic, reaching Bermuda and beyond (e.g., Dickerson et al., 1995; Penkett 
  et al., 1998; Prados et al., 1999). The Pacific Exploratory Missions (PEM: Hoell 
  et al., 1997, 1999) measured extensive plumes of pollution including ozone and 
  its precursors downwind of eastern Asia. Convective transport of emissions from 
  biomass burning affect the abundance of O<sub>3</sub> in the mid- and upper 
  troposphere (Pickering et al., 1996). Emissions by tropical fires in South America 
  and southern Africa have been identified as the cause of enhanced O<sub>3</sub> 
  over the South Atlantic (Thompson et al., 1996), and the effects of biomass 
  burning were seen in the remote South Pacific in PEM Tropics A (Schultz et al., 
  1999; Talbot et al ., 1999). Due to the widely varying chemical environments, 
  these extensive studies provide a statistical sampling of conditions along with 
  a critical test of the photochemistry in CTM simulations, but they do not provide 
  an integrated budget for tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>. An example of such model-and-measurements 
  study is given in the <a href="143.htm#426">Section 4.2.6</a> discussion of 
  tropospheric OH. </p>

<p><a name="fig48"></a>Recent trends in global tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> are 
  extremely difficult to infer from the available measurements, while trends in 
  the stratosphere are readily identified (Randel et al., 1999; WMO, 1999). With 
  photochemistry producing local lifetimes as short as a few days in the boundary 
  layer, the local measurement of tropo-spheric O<sub>3</sub> does not reflect 
  the abundance over the surrounding continent, and a surface measurement is not 
  representative of the bulk of the troposphere above. Thus it is not contradictory 
  for decadal trends in different atmospheric regions to be different, e.g., driven 
  by the regional changes in pollutants, particularly NO<sub>x</sub>. Ozone sondes 
  offer the best record of O<sub>3</sub> throughout the troposphere, although 
  measurements at many stations are made only weekly (infrequently for a variable 
  gas like O<sub>3</sub>). Weekly continuous data since 1970 are available from 
  only nine stations in the latitude range 36&deg;N to 59&deg;N (Logan et al., 
  1999; WMO, 1999). Different trends are seen at different locations for different 
  periods. Most stations show an increase from 1970 to 1980, but no clear trend 
  from 1980 to 1996. A composite record of the mid-tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  abundance from 1970 to 1996 from the nine stations is taken from the analysis 
  of Logan et al. (1999) and presented in <a href="142.htm#fig48">Figure 4.8</a>. 
  There is no obvious linear increase in O<sub>3</sub> abundance over this period, 
  although the second half of this record (about 57 ppb) is clearly greater than 
  the first half (about 53 ppb). Of the fourteen stations with records since 1980, 
  only two, one in Japan and one in Europe, had statistically significant increases 
  in mid-tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> between 1980 and 1995. By contrast, the four 
  Canadian stations, all at high latitudes, had significant decreases for the 
  same time period. Surface O<sub>3</sub> measurements from seventeen background 
  stations also show no clear trend, even in the northern mid-latitudes (Oltmans 
  et al., 1998; WMO, 1999). The largest negative trend in surface O<sub>3</sub> 
  was -0.7 &plusmn; 0.2%/yr at the South Pole (1975 to 1997), while the largest 
  positive trend was +1.5 &plusmn; 0.5%/yr at Zugspitze, Germany (1978 to 1995). 
  This ambiguous record of change over the past two decades may possibly be reconciled 
  with the model predictions (see <a href="148.htm#44">Section 4.4</a>) of increasing 
  tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> driven regionally by increasing emissions of pollutants: 
  the growth in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions is expected to have shifted from North 
  America and Europe to Asia.</p>
<p>The change in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> since the pre-industrial era is even 
  more difficult to evaluate on the basis of measurements alone. Since O<sub>3</sub> 
  is reactive, atmospheric abundances cannot be retrieved from ice cores. Recent 
  evaluations of surface measurements in the 19th and early 20th century in Europe 
  (Volz and Kley, 1988; Staehelin et al., 1994, 1998; Harris et al., 1997) indicate 
  much lower O<sub>3</sub> abundances than today, yet the scaling of these data 
  to a tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> burden, even for northern mid-latitudes, is 
  not obvious. In the SAR, these data were used to make a rough estimate that 
  O<sub>3</sub> abundances in the Northern Hemispheric troposphere have doubled 
  since the pre-industrial era. A similar difference, of 10 to 13 DU when globally 
  averaged, is obtained using the climatology given by Park et al. (1999) for 
  tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> today and a parallel one with abundances adjusted 
  to match the 19th century measurements in the Northern Hemisphere. CTM calculations 
  predict that current anthropogenic emissions of NO<sub>x</sub>, CO, and VOC, 
  as well as the increase in CH<sub>4</sub> should have increased tropospheric 
  O<sub>3</sub> by a similar amount, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. A recent 
  survey of CTM studies gives global average increases ranging from 8 to 12 DU, 
  although this small range does not adequately represent the uncertainty. These 
  results are summarised in <a href="#tab49">Table 4.9</a>. Based on measurements, 
  analyses, and models, the most likely increase in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> 
  was 9 DU globally averaged, with a 67% confidence range of 6 to 13 DU. For some 
  of the emissions scenarios considered here, tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> is expected 
  to increase even more in the 21st century as emissions of its precursors - NO<sub>x</sub>, 
  CO and VOC - continue to grow (see <a href="148.htm#44">Section 4.4</a>).</p>
