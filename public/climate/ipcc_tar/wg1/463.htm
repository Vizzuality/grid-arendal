<p><i>Sensitivity of results</i><br>
  A variety of sensitivity tests confirm that the detection of anthropogenic signals 
  is insensitive to differences between solar forcing reconstructions, the inclusion 
  of additional forcing through the specification of observed stratospheric ozone 
  concentrations, and to varying details of the analysis (including omitting the 
  signal-to-noise optimisation). Tett et al. (1999, 2000) also found that detection 
  of an anthropogenic signal continues to hold even when the standard deviation 
  of the control simulation is inflated by a factor of two. Uncertainty in the 
  signals is unavoidable when ensembles are small, as is the case in Tett et al. 
  (1999), and biases the estimates of the signal amplitudes towards zero. Consistent 
  results are obtained when this source of uncertainty is taken into account (Allen 
  and Stott, 2000; Stott et al., 2000a). However amplitude estimates become more 
  uncertain, particularly if the underlying signal is small compared with internal 
  climate variability. Accounting for sampling uncertainty in model-simulated 
  signals indicates a greater degree of greenhouse warming and compensating aerosol 
  cooling in the latter part of the century than shown by Tett et al. (1999). 
  Gillett et al. (2000b) find that discounting the temperature changes associated 
  with changes in the Arctic Oscillation (Thompson and Wallace, 1998; Thompson 
  et al., 2000), which are not simulated by the model, does not significantly 
  alter the Tett et al. (1999) results.</p>
<p><i>Confidence intervals and scaling factors</i><br>
  Confidence intervals for the signal amplitudes that are obtained from the regression 
  of modelled signals onto observations can be re-expressed as ranges of scaling 
  factors that are required to make modelled signal amplitudes consistent with 
  those estimated from observations (see, e.g., Allen and Tett, 1999). The results 
  show that the range of scaling factors includes unity (i.e., model is consistent 
  with observations) for both the greenhouse gas and the sulphate aerosol signal, 
  and that the scaling factors vary only to a reasonable (and consistent) extent 
  between 50-year intervals. </p>
<p>The scaling factors can also be used to estimate the contribution from anthropogenic 
  factors other than well-mixed greenhouse gases. Using the methodology of Allen 
  and Stott (2000) on the simulations described by Tett et al. (2000), the 5 to 
  95% uncertainty range for scaling the combined response changes in tropospheric 
  ozone and direct and indirect sulphate forcing over the last fifty years is 
  0.6 to 1.6. The simulated indirect effect of aerosol forcing is by far the biggest 
  contributor to this signal. Ignoring the possible effects of neglected forcings 
  and assuming that the forcing can be scaled in the same way as the response, 
  this translates to a -0.5 to -1.5 Wm<sup>-2</sup> change in forcing due to the indirect 
  effect since pre-industrial times. This range lies well within that given in 
  Chapter 6 but the limits obtained are sensitive to the model used. Note that 
  large values of the indirect response are consistently associated with a greater 
  sensitivity to greenhouse gases. This would increase this model's estimate 
  of future warming: a large indirect effect coupled with decreases in sulphate 
  emissions would further enhance future warming (Allen et al., 2000b). </p>
<p>Allen et al. (2000a) have determined scaling factors from other model simulations 
  (<a href="#fig1212">Figure 12.12</a>) and found that the modelled response to 
  the combination of greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol forcing is consistent 
  with that observed. The scaling factors ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 and the corresponding 
  95% confidence intervals cover the range 0.5 to 1.6. Scaling factors for 50-year 
  JJA trends are also easily derived from the results published in Hegerl et al. 
  (2000). The resulting range of factors is consistent with that of Allen et al. 
  (2000a), but wider because the diagnostic used in Allen et al. (2000b) enhances 
  the signal-to-noise ratio. If it is assumed that the combination of greenhouse 
  warming and sulphate cooling simulated by these AOGCMs is the only significant 
  external contributor to inter-decadal near-surface temperature changes over 
  the latter half of the 20th century, then Allen et al. (2000a) estimate that 
  the anthropogenic warming over the last 50 years is 0.05 to 0.11&deg;C/decade. 
  Making a similar assumption, Hegerl et al. (2000) estimate 0.02 to 0.12&deg;C/decade 
  with a best guess of 0.06 to 0.08&deg;C/decade (model dependent, <a href="460.htm#fig1210">Figure 
  12.10</a>). The smallness of the range of uncertainty compared with the observed 
  change indicates that natural internal variability alone is unlikely (bordering 
  on very unlikely) to account for the observed warming.</p>

      <p><b>Figure 12.12:</b> (a) Estimates of the "scaling factors" 
        by which we have to multiply the amplitude of several model-simulated 
        signals to reproduce the corresponding changes in the observed record. 
        The vertical bars indicate the 5 to 95% uncertainty range due to internal 
        variability. A range encompassing unity implies that this combination 
        of forcing amplitude and model-simulated response is consistent with the 
        corresponding observed change, while a range encompassing zero implies 
        that this model-simulated signal is not detectable (Allen and Stott, 2000; 
        Stott et al., 2000a). Signals are defined as the ensemble mean response 
        to external forcing expressed in large-scale (&gt;5000 km) near-surface 
        temperatures over the 1946 to 1996 period relative to the 1896 to 1996 
        mean. The first entry (G) shows the scaling factor and 5 to 95% confidence 
        interval obtained if we assume the observations consist only of a response 
        to greenhouse gases plus internal variability. The range is significantly 
        less than one (consistent with results from other models), meaning that 
        models forced with greenhouse gases alone significantly overpredict the 
        observed warming signal. The next eight entries show scaling factors for 
        model-simulated responses to greenhouse and sulphate forcing (GS), with 
        two cases including indirect sulphate and tropospheric ozone forcing, 
        one of these also including stratospheric ozone depletion (GSI and GSIO 
        respectively). All but one (CGCM1) of these ranges is consistent with 
        unity. Hence there is little evidence that models are systematically over- 
        or under-predicting the amplitude of the observed response under the assumption 
        that model-simulated GS signals and internal variability are an adequate 
        representation (i.e. that natural forcing has had little net impact on 
        this diagnostic). Observed residual variability is consistent with this 
        assumption in all but one case (ECHAM3, indicated by the asterisk). We 
        are obliged to make this assumption to include models for which only a 
        simulation of the anthropogenic response is available, but uncertainty 
        estimates in these single-signal cases are incomplete since they do not 
        account for uncertainty in the naturally forced response. These ranges 
        indicate, however, the high level of confidence with which we can reject 
        internal variability as simulated by these various models as an explanation 
        of recent near-surface temperature change. <br>
        A more complete uncertainty analysis is provided by the next three entries, 
        which show corresponding scaling factors on individual greenhouse (G), 
        sulphate (S), solar-plus-volcanic (N), solar-only (So) and volcanic-only 
        (V) signals for those cases in which the relevant simulations have been 
        performed. In these cases, we estimate multiple factors simultaneously 
        to account for uncertainty in the amplitude of the naturally forced response. 
        The uncertainties increase but the greenhouse signal remains consistently 
        detectable. In one case (ECHAM3) the model appears to be overestimating 
        the greenhouse response (scaling range in the G signal inconsistent with 
        unity), but this result is sensitive to which component of the control 
        is used to define the detection space. It is also not known how it would 
        respond to the inclusion of a volcanic signal. In cases where both solar 
        and volcanic forcing is included (HadCM2 and HadCM3), G and S signals 
        remain detectable and consistent with unity independent of whether natural 
        signals are estimated jointly or separately (allowing for different errors 
        in S and V responses). (b) Estimated contributions to global mean warming 
        over the 20th century, based on the results shown in (a), with 5 to 95% 
        confidence intervals. Although the estimates vary depending on which model's 
        signal and what forcing is assumed, and are less certain if more than 
        one signal is estimated, all show a significant contribution from anthropogenic 
        climate change to 20th century warming (from Allen et al., 2000a). </p>

<p>Given the uncertainties in sulphate aerosol and natural forcings and responses, 
  these single-pattern confidence intervals give an incomplete picture. We cannot 
  assume that the response to sulphate forcing (relative to the greenhouse signal) 
  is as simulated in these greenhouse-plus-sulphate simulations; nor can we assume 
  the net response to natural forcing is negligible even though observations of 
  surface temperature changes over the past 30 to 50 years are generally consistent 
  with both these assumptions. Hence we need also to consider uncertainty ranges 
  based on estimating several signals simultaneously (<a href="#fig1212">Figure 
  12.12</a>, right hand panels). These are generally larger than the single-signal 
  estimates because we are attempting to estimate more information from the same 
  amount of data (Tett et al., 1999; Allen and Stott, 2000; Allen et al., 2000a). 
  Nevertheless, the conclusion of a substantial greenhouse contribution to the 
  recent observed warming trend is unchanged. </p>
