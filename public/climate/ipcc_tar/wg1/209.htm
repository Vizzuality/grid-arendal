<p> One issue of importance for future scenarios concerns the treatment of black 
  carbon removal rates. Whereas most models projected changes for BC to be approximately 
  linear, the ULAQ and GISS models had somewhat different treatments. In the ULAQ 
  model, the reaction of O<sub>3</sub> with BC leads to additional losses for 
  BC. This caused a change of -30% for BC in the A2 2100 scenario in the simulation 
  that included consideration of chemistry feedbacks (SC6) relative to the scenario 
  without changes in chemistry (SC3). The GISS model, on the other hand, did not 
  consider any heterogeneous loss, but did assume that the loss of BC associated 
  with wet scavenging depended on the interaction of BC with SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. 
  In this model, as SO<sub>2</sub> emissions decrease, the lifetime of BC increased. 
  This model projects a 50% increase in BC lifetime (and thus in the concentrations 
  relative to emissions) in 2100 associated with the A2 scenario. Thus, the uncertainty 
  associated with the projection of BC concentrations is larger than that for 
  the other aerosol types.<br>
</p>
<p> In addition to the studies outlined above, one additional study was performed. 
  In this study, the A2 2100 emission scenario was used to simulate HNO<sub>3</sub> 
  concentrations in 2100 using the Harvard University model (see <a href="160.htm">Chapter 
  4</a>) and the present day anthropogenic NH<sub>3</sub> emissions were scaled 
  by the increase in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in 2100 from the draft SRES A2 scenario. 
  Then the model described by Adams et al. (1999) was used to estimate direct 
  forcing after condensation of the additional HNO<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> 
  onto the calculated sulphate aerosol. The nitrate and ammonium burdens increased 
  by about a factor of 4.7 and a factor of 1.9, respectively, in the A2 2100 scenario. 
  The estimated forcing associated with anthropogenic SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, 
  nitrate, and ammonium aerosols increased from -1.78 Wm<sup>-2</sup> to 
  -2.77 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. Thus, the control of sulphate aerosol in future 
  scenarios may not necessarily lead to decreases in forcing, if the levels of 
  ammonium nitrate in aerosol increase.<br>
</p>
<p> Two final considerations include the possible impact of chemistry and climate 
  changes on future concentrations. These were examined by the ULAQ model for 
  the A2 2100 scenario. Future concentration changes were small for the simulation 
  that included changes in chemistry only (scenario SC6). Climate feedbacks, however, 
  were significant. Aerosol concentrations changed by as much as -20% relative 
  to the model simulations that did not include climate change.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="554"></a>5.5.4 Linkage to Other Issues and Summary <br>
</h3>
<p>As we have seen, anthropogenic aerosols may have a substantial effect on the 
  present day aerosol abundance, optical depth and thus forcing of climate. While 
  we have made substantial progress in defining the role of anthropogenic aerosols 
  on direct forcing, significant uncertainties remain, particularly with the role 
  of anthropogenic organic and black carbon aerosols in detemining this forcing. 
  Our ability to assess the indirect forcing by aerosols has a much larger uncertainty 
  associated with it. The largest estimates of negative forcing due to the warm-cloud 
  indirect effect may approach or exceed the positive forcing due to long-lived 
  greenhouse gases. On the other hand, there is sufficient uncertainty in the 
  calculation of indirect forcing to allow values that are substantially smaller 
  than the positive forcing by greenhouse gases. Other factors which have not 
  been assessed include possible anthropogenic perturbations to high level cirrus 
  clouds as well as to clouds in the reservoir between 0&deg;C and -35&deg;C. 
  As we have discussed, significant positive forcing is possible from aerosol-induced 
  increased formation of cirrus and/or from increased glaciation of clouds in 
  the region between 0&deg;C and -35&deg;C. <br>
</p>
<p> Concerns about aerosols derive from a number of other considerations. These 
  include visibility, toxic effects and human health, interactions of aerosols 
  with chemical processes in the troposphere and stratosphere, acid deposition, 
  and air pollution. Of these concerns, those associated with toxic effects and 
  visibility have led the industrialised countries to promulgate standards to 
  reduce the concentrations of aerosols in urban and also more pristine locations. 
  Also, concerns about the effects of acid rain have led to increased controls 
  over the emissions of SO<sub>2</sub>. As shown above, the SRES scenarios for 
  the future (Nakic&acute;enovic&acute; et al., 2000) have all assumed that emissions 
  of SO<sub>2</sub> will eventually decrease, and the A1T and B2 scenarios predict 
  that sulphur emissions start to decrease on a global average basis almost immediately. 
  <br>
</p>
<p> Emissions of carbon aerosols in the future may not necessarily follow the 
  scenarios outlined for SO<sub>2</sub> within the SRES scenarios. Furthermore, 
  older scenarios, developed by IPCC (1992), do not presume that SO<sub>2</sub> 
  emissions would necessarily decrease. We have evaluated a set of scenarios for 
  future aerosols that account for a range of possible future emissions. We noted 
  that one of the future effects that need to be evaluated includes the perturbation 
  to the cycles of natural aerosols. Another includes the interaction of chemical 
  cycles with aerosols and the prediction of how changes in other gas-phase emissions 
  may be perturbing aerosols. We must also consider how changes in aerosols may 
  perturb gas phase cycles. Our evaluation of these interactions has been necessarily 
  limited. Both the interaction of atmospheric chemical cycles with aerosols and 
  the perturbation to natural aerosol components through changing climate patterns 
  need to be better understood.</p>
