<h4>14.2.4.1 The marine carbon system</h4>
<p>The marine carbon cycle plays an important role in the partitioning of CO<sub>2</sub> 
  between the atmosphere and the ocean (<a href="104.htm">Chapter 3, Section 3.2.3</a>). 
  The primary controls are the circulation of the ocean (a function of the climate 
  system), and two important biogeochemical processes: the solubility pump and 
  the biological pump, both of which act to create a global mean increase of dissolved 
  inorganic carbon with depth.</p>
<p>The physical circulation and the interplay of the circulation and the biogeochemical 
  processes are central to understanding the ocean carbon system and future concentrations 
  of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. In the ocean, the prevailing focus on surface 
  conditions and heat transport has led to a comparative neglect of transport 
  processes below about 800 m depth. For carbon cycle modelling, however, vertical 
  transports and deep horizontal transports assume fundamental importance. The 
  importance of the thermohaline circulation is obviously important (and insufficiently 
  well understood; see <a href="508.htm">Section 14.2.3.2</a>) in moving carbon 
  from the surface to deeper layers. Similarly, the regional distribution of upwelling, 
  which brings carbon- and nutrient-rich water to surface layers, is poorly known 
  and inconsistently simulated in models. The ventilation of the Southern Ocean 
  provides an extreme, though not unique, example. </p>
<p>It has been pointed out by a number of modelling studies that if there were 
  no marine biological system, then the pre-industrial atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> 
  concentration would have been 450 ppmv instead of 280 ppmv (Sarmiento and Toggweiler 
  1984; Maier-Raimer et al., 1996). Any complete model of the natural ocean carbon 
  cycle should therefore include the biological system; however, most recent assessments 
  of the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> have assumed that the 
  biological system would not be affected by climate change and have therefore 
  only modelled the chemical solubility in addition to the physical circulation. 
  This was based on the understanding that nitrate or other nutrients limit marine 
  phytoplankton growth. There would therefore be no CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation 
  effect as has been suggested for terrestrial plants and that, unless there was 
  a large change in the nutrient supply to the upper ocean because of a climate-induced 
  shift in circulation, then no extra anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> could be sequestered 
  to the deep ocean by the organic matter pump. More recently, a number of studies 
  have suggested possible ways in which the organic matter pump might be affected 
  by climate change over a 200-year time-scale (see <a href="105.htm">Chapter 
  3, Sections 3.2.3.2</a> and <a href="106.htm">3.2.3.3</a>). The main conclusion 
  was that, because of the complexity of biological systems, it was not yet possible 
  to say whether some of the likely feedbacks would be positive or negative. However, 
  it is clear that our understanding of these issues needs to be improved.</p>
<p>Simulating the calcium carbonate system with a process-oriented model presents 
  another level of complexity beyond simulating the organic matter formation-decomposition: 
  the distribution of particular phytoplankton species (mainly cocco-lithophorids) 
  must be simulated. The calcium carbonate pump, however, contributes relatively 
  little to the vertical dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) gradient compared to 
  the organic matter and solubility pumps. The importance of this pump needs careful 
  evaluation and its past (palaeo) role in the carbon cycle needs to be considered 
  (see end of <a href="106.htm">Chapter 3, Section 3.2.3.3</a>).</p>
<p>In the ocean, models incorporating biology are relatively underdeveloped and 
  incorporate empirical assumptions (such as fixed Redfield (nutrient) ratios) 
  rather than explicitly modelling the underlying processes. As a result, present 
  models may be unduly constrained in the range of responses they can show to 
  changes in climate and ocean dynamics. A better understanding is required concerning 
  the workings of nutrient constraints on productivity, the controls of nitrogen 
  fixation, and the controls on the geographical distribution of biogeochemically 
  important species and functional types in the ocean. To develop this understanding 
  it will be necessary to combine remotely sensed information with a greatly expanded 
  network of continuous biogeochemical monitoring sites, and to gather data on 
  the space-time patterns of variability in species composition of marine ecosystems 
  in relation to climate variability phenomena such as ENSO and NAO. (See <a href="117.htm">Chapter 
  3, Sections 3.6.3</a> and <a href="119.htm">3.7</a>).</p>
