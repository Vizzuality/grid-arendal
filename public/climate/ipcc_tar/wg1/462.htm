<p><i><a name="fig1211"></a></i>Here we consider studies that incorporate the 
  time evolution of forced signals into the optimal detection formalism. These 
  studies use evolving patterns of historical climate change in the 20th century 
  that are obtained from climate models forced with historical anthropogenic and 
  natural forcing. Explicit representation of the time dimension of the signals 
  yields a more powerful approach for both detecting and attributing climate change 
  (see Hasselmann, 1993; North et al., 1995) since it helps to distinguish between 
  responses to external forcings with similar spatial patterns (e.g., solar and 
  greenhouse gas forcing). The time variations of the signals can be represented 
  either directly in the time domain or transformed to the frequency domain. </p>
<p><i>Surface temperature</i><br>
  Tett et al. (1999) and Stott et al. (2001) describe a detection and attribution 
  study that uses the space-time approach (see <a href="469.htm">Appendix 12.2</a>). 
  They estimate the magnitude of modelled 20th century greenhouse gas, aerosol, 
  solar and volcanic signals in decadal mean data. Signals are fitted by general 
  linear regression to moving fifty-year intervals beginning with 1906 to 1956 
  and ending 1946 to 1996. The signals are obtained from four ensembles of transient 
  change simulations, each using a different historical forcing scenario. Greenhouse 
  gas, greenhouse gas plus direct sulphate aerosol, low frequency solar, and volcanic 
  forcing scenarios were used. Each ensemble contains four independent simulations 
  with the same transient forcing. Two estimates of natural variability, one used 
  for optimisation and the other for the estimation of confidence intervals, are 
  obtained from separate segments of a long control simulation. </p>
<p>Signal amplitudes estimated with multiple regression become uncertain when 
  the signals are strongly correlated ("degenerate"). Despite the problem 
  of degeneracy, positive and significant greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol 
  signals are consistently detected in the most recent fifty-year period (<a href="#fig1211">Figure 
  12.11</a>) regardless of which or how many other signals are included in the 
  analysis (Allen et al., 2000a; Stott et al., 2001). The residual variation that 
  remains after removal of the signals is consistent with the model's internal 
  variability. In contrast, recent decadal temperature changes are not consistent 
  with the model's internal climate variability alone, nor with any combination 
  of internal variability and naturally forced signals, even allowing for the 
  possibility of unknown processes amplifying the response to natural forcing.</p>
<p>Tett et al. (2000) have completed a study using a model with no flux adjustments, 
  an interactive sulphur cycle, an explicit representation of individual greenhouse 
  gases and an explicit treatment of scattering by aerosols. Two ensembles of 
  four simulations for the instrumental period were run, one with natural (solar 
  and volcanic) forcing only and the other anthropogenic (well-mixed greenhouse 
  gases, ozone and direct and indirect sulphate aerosol) forcing only (see <a href="449.htm#fig124">Figure 
  12.4</a>). They find a substantial response to anthropogenic forcing is needed 
  to explain observed changes in recent decades, and that natural forcing may 
  have contributed significantly to early 20th century climate change. The best 
  agreement between model simulations and observations over the last 140 years 
  has been found when all the above anthropogenic and natural forcing factors 
  are included (Stott et al., 2000b; <a href="450.htm#fig127">Figure 12.7c</a>). 
  These results show that the forcings included are sufficient to explain the 
  observed changes, but do not exclude the possibility that other forcings may 
  also have contributed.</p>
<p>The detection of a response to solar forcing in the early part of the century 
  (1906 to 1956) is less robust and depends on the details of the analysis. If 
  seasonally stratified data are used (Stott et al., 2001), the detection of a 
  significant solar influence on climate in the first half of the century becomes 
  clearer with the solar irradiance reconstruction of Hoyt and Schatten (1993), 
  but weaker with that from Lean et al. (1995). Volcanism appears to show only 
  a small signal in recent decadal temperature trends and could only be detected 
  using either annual mean data or specifically chosen decades (Stott et al., 
  2001). The residual variability that remains after the naturally forced signals 
  are removed from the observations of the most recent five decades are not consistent 
  with model internal variability, suggesting that natural forcing alone cannot 
  explain the observed 20th century temperature variations. Note that Delworth 
  and Knutson (2000) find one out of five of their simulations with only anthropogenic 
  forcing can reproduce the early century global mean warming, including the enhanced 
  warming in Northern Hemisphere high latitudes. Hence a substantial response 
  to anthropogenic (specifically greenhouse) forcing appears necessary to account 
  for the warming over the past 50 years, but it remains unclear whether natural 
  external forcings are necessary to explain the early 20th century warming.</p>
