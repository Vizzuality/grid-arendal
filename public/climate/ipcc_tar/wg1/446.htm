<p><i>Estimates of the variability of global mean surface temperature</i><br>
</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="right">
  <tr> 
    <td class="figure"><a href="fig12-2.htm"><img src="images/fig12-2s.gif" width="300" height="218" border="0"></a><br>
      <b>Figure 12.2:</b> Coloured lines: power spectra of global mean temperatures 
      in the unforced control integrations that are used to provide estimates 
      of internal climate variability in <a href="fig12-12.htm">Figure 12.12</a>. 
      All series were linearly detrended prior to analysis, and spectra computed 
      using a standard Tukey window with the window width (maximum lag used in 
      the estimate) set to one-fifth of the series length, giving each spectral 
      estimate the same uncertainty range, as shown (see, e.g., Priestley, 1981). 
      The first 300 years were omitted from ECHAM3-LSG, CGCM1 and CGCM2 models 
      as potentially trend-contaminated. Solid black line: spectrum of observed 
      global mean temperatures (Jones et al., 2001) over the period 1861 to 1998 
      after removing a best-fit linear trend. This estimate is unreliable on inter-decadal 
      time-scales because of the likely impact of external forcing on the observed 
      series and the negative bias introduced by the detrending. Dotted black 
      line: spectrum of observed global mean temperatures after removing an independent 
      estimate of the externally forced response provided by the ensemble mean 
      of a coupled model simulation (Stott et al., 2000b, and <a href="450.htm#fig127">Figure 
      12.7c</a>). This estimate will be contaminated by uncertainty in the model-simulated 
      forced response, together with observation noise and sampling error. However, 
      unlike the detrending procedure, all of these introduce a positive (upward) 
      bias in the resulting estimate of the observed spectrum. The dotted line 
      therefore provides a conservative (high) estimate of observed internal variability 
      at all frequencies. Asterisks indicate models whose variability is significantly 
      less than observed variability on 10 to 60 year time-scales after removing 
      either a best-fit linear trend or an independent estimate of the forced 
      response from the observed series. Significance is based on an F-test on 
      the ratio observed/model mean power over this frequency interval and quoted 
      at the 5% level. Power spectral density (PSD) is defined such that unit-variance 
      uncorrelated noise would have an expected PSD of unity (see Allen et al., 
      2000a, for details). Note that different normalisation conventions can lead 
      to different values, which appear as a constant offset up or down on the 
      logarithmic vertical scale used here. Differences between the spectra shown 
      here and the corresponding figure in Stouffer et al. (2000) shown in <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
      8</a>, <a href="327.htm#fig818">Figure 8.18</a> are due to the use here 
      of a longer (1861 to 2000) observational record, as opposed to 1881 to 1991 
      in <a href="327.htm#fig818">Figure 8.18</a>. That figure also shows 2.5 
      to 97.5% uncertainty ranges, while for consistency with other figures in 
      this chapter, the 5 to 95% range is displayed here.</td>

<p><a name="fig122"></a>Stouffer et al. (2000) assess variability simulated in 
  three 1,000-year control simulations (see <a href="445.htm#fig121">Figure 12.1</a>). 
  The models are found to simulate reasonably well the spatial distribution of 
  variability and the spatial correlation between regional and global mean variability, 
  although there is more disagreement between models at long time-scales (&gt;50 
  years) than at short time-scales. None of the long model simulations produces 
  a secular trend which is comparable to that observed. <a href="308.htm">Chapter 
  8</a>, <a href="327.htm">Section 8.6.2</a>. assesses model-simulated variability 
  in detail. Here we assess the aspects that are particularly relevant to climate 
  change detection. The power spectrum of global mean temperatures simulated by 
  the most recent coupled climate models (shown in <a href="#fig122">Figure 12.2</a>) 
  compares reasonably well with that of detrended observations (solid black line) 
  on interannual to decadal time-scales. However, uncertainty of the spectral 
  estimates is large and some models are clearly underestimating variability (indicated 
  by the asterisks). Detailed comparison on inter-decadal time-scales is difficult 
  because observations are likely to contain a response to external forcings that 
  will not be entirely removed by a simple linear trend. At the same time, the 
  detrending procedure itself introduces a negative bias in the observed low-frequency 
  spectrum. </p>
<p>Both of these problems can be avoided by removing an independent estimate of 
  the externally forced response from the observations before computing the power 
  spectrum. This independent estimate is provided by the ensemble mean of a coupled 
  model simulation of the response to the combination of natural and anthropogenic 
  forcing (see <a href="450.htm#fig127">Figure 12.7c</a>). The resulting spectrum 
  of observed variability (dotted line in <a href="#fig122">Figure 12.2</a>) will 
  not be subject to a negative bias because the observed data have not been used 
  in estimating the forced response. It will, however, be inflated by uncertainty 
  in the model-simulated forced response and by noise due to observation error 
  and due to incomplete coverage (particularly the bias towards relatively noisy 
  Northern Hemisphere land temperatures in the early part of the observed series). 
  This estimate of the observed spectrum is therefore likely to overestimate power 
  at all frequencies. Even so, the more variable models display similar variance 
  on the decadal to inter-decadal time-scales important for detection and attribution.</p>
<p><i>Estimates of spatial patterns of variability</i><br>
  Several studies have used common empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis 
  to compare the spatial modes of climate variability between different models. 
  Stouffer et al. (2000) analysed the variability of 5-year means of surface temperature 
  in 500-year or longer simulations of the three models most commonly used to 
  estimate internal variability in formal detection studies. The distribution 
  of the variance between the EOFs was similar between the models and the observations. 
  HadCM2 tended to overestimate the variability in the main modes, whereas GFDL 
  and ECHAM3 underestimated the variability of the first mode. The standard deviations 
  of the dominant modes of variability in the three models differ from observations 
  by less than a factor of two, and one model (HadCM2) has similar or more variability 
  than the observations in all leading modes. In general, one would expect to 
  obtain conservative detection and attribution results when natural variability 
  is estimated with such a model. One should also expect control simulations to 
  be less variable than observations because they do not contain externally forced 
  variability. Hegerl et al. (2000) used common EOFS to compare 50-year June-July-August 
  (JJA) trends of surface temperature in ECHAM3 and HadCM2. Standard deviation 
  differences between models were marginally larger on the 50-year time-scale 
  (less than a factor of 2.5). Comparison with direct observations cannot be made 
  on this time-scale because the instrumental record is too short.</p>
<p><i>Variability of the free atmosphere</i><br>
  Gillett et al. (2000a) compared model-simulated variability in the free atmosphere 
  with that of detrended radiosonde data. They found general agreement except 
  in the stratosphere, where present climate models tend to underestimate variability 
  on all time-scales and, in particular, do not reproduce modes of variability 
  such as the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). On decadal time-scales, the model 
  simulated less variability than observed in some aspects of the vertical patterns 
  important for the detection of anthropogenic climate change. The discrepancy 
  is partially resolved by the inclusion of anthropogenic (greenhouse gas, sulphate 
  and stratospheric ozone) forcing in the model. However, the authors also find 
  evidence that solar forcing plays a significant role on decadal time-scales, 
  indicating that this should be taken into account in future detection studies 
  based on changes in the free atmosphere (see also discussion in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a> and <a href="448.htm">Section 12.2.3.1</a> below).</p>
<p><i>Comparison of model and palaeoclimatic estimates of variability</i><br>
  Comparisons between the variability in palaeo-reconstructions and climate model 
  data have shown mixed results to date. Barnett et al. (1996) compared the spatial 
  structure of climate variability of coupled climate models and proxy time-series 
  for (mostly summer) decadal temperature (Jones et al., 1998). They found that 
  the model-simulated amplitude of the dominant proxy mode of variation is substantially 
  less than that estimated from the proxy data. However, choosing the EOFs of 
  the palaeo-data as the basis for comparison will maximise the variance in the 
  palaeo-data and not the models, and so bias the model amplitudes downwards. 
  The neglect of naturally forced climate variability in the models might also 
  be responsible for part of the discrepancy noted in Barnett et al. (1996) (see 
  also Jones et al., 1998). The limitations of the temperature reconstructions 
  (see <a href="048.htm">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="069.htm#fig221">Figure 2.21</a>), 
  including for example the issue of how to relate site-specific palaeo-data to 
  large-scale variations, may also contribute to this discrepancy. Collins et 
  al. (2000) compared the standard deviation of large-scale Northern Hemisphere 
  averages in a model control simulation and in tree-ring-based proxy data for 
  the last 600 years on decadal time-scales. They found a factor of less than 
  two difference between model and data if the tree-ring data are calibrated such 
  that low-frequency variability is better retained than in standard methods (Briffa 
  et al., 2000). It is likely that at least part of this discrepancy can be resolved 
  if natural forcings are included in the model simulation. Crowley (2000) found 
  that 41 to 69% of the variance in decadally smoothed Northern Hemisphere mean 
  surface temperature reconstructions could be externally forced (using data from 
  Mann et al. (1998) and Crowley and Lowery (2000)). The residual variability 
  in the reconstructions, after subtracting estimates of volcanic and solar-forced 
  signals, showed no significant difference in variability on decadal and multi-decadal 
  time-scales from three long coupled model control simulations. In summary, while 
  there is substantial uncertainty in comparisons between long-term palaeo-records 
  of surface temperature and model estimates of multi-decadal variability, there 
  is no clear evidence of a serious discrepancy.</p>
<p><i>Summary</i><br>
  These findings emphasise that there is still considerable uncertainty in the 
  magnitude of internal climate variability. Various approaches are used in detection 
  and attribution studies to account for this uncertainty. Some studies use data 
  from a number of coupled climate model control simulations (Santer et al., 1995; 
  Hegerl et al., 1996, 1997, North and Stevens, 1998) and choose the most conservative 
  result. In other studies, the estimate of internal variance is inflated to assess 
  the sensitivity of detection and attribution results to the level of internal 
  variance (Santer et al., 1996a, Tett et al., 1999; Stott et al., 2001). Some 
  authors also augment model-derived estimates of natural variability with estimates 
  from observations (Hegerl et al., 1996). A method for checking the consistency 
  between the residual variability in the observations after removal of externally 
  forced signals (see <a href="468.htm#equ121">equation A12.1.1</a>, <a href="468.htm">Appendix 
  12.1</a>) and the natural internal variability estimated from control simulations 
  is also available (e.g., Allen and Tett, 1999). Results indicate that, on the 
  scales considered, there is no evidence for a serious inconsistency between 
  the variability in models used for optimal fingerprint studies and observations 
  (Allen and Tett, 1999; Tett et al., 1999; Hegerl et al., 2000, 2001; Stott et 
  al., 2001). The use of this test and the use of internal variability from the 
  models with the greatest variability increases confidence in conclusions derived 
  from optimal detection studies.</p>
