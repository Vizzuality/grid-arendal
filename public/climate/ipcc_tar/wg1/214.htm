<h2>6.1 Radiative Forcing</h2>
<h3><a name="611"></a>6.1.1 Definition</h3>
<p>The term "radiative forcing" has been employed in the IPCC Assessments 
  to denote an externally imposed perturbation in the radiative energy budget 
  of the Earth's climate system. Such a perturbation can be brought about 
  by secular changes in the concentrations of radiatively active species (e.g., 
  CO<sub>2</sub>, aerosols), changes in the solar irradiance incident upon the 
  planet, or other changes that affect the radiative energy absorbed by the surface 
  (e.g., changes in surface reflection properties). This imbalance in the radiation 
  budget has the potential to lead to changes in climate parameters and thus result 
  in a new equilibrium state of the climate system. In particular, IPCC (1990, 
  1992, 1994) and the Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) used 
  the following definition for the radiative forcing of the climate system: "The 
  radiative forcing of the surface-troposphere system due to the perturbation 
  in or the introduction of an agent (say, a change in greenhouse gas concentrations) 
  is the change in net (down minus up) irradiance (solar plus long-wave; in Wm<sup>-2</sup>) 
  at the tropopause AFTER allowing for stratospheric temperatures to readjust 
  to radiative equilibrium, but with surface and tropo-spheric temperatures and 
  state held fixed at the unperturbed values". In the context of climate 
  change, the term forcing is restricted to changes in the radiation balance of 
  the surface-troposphere system imposed by external factors, with no changes 
  in stratospheric dynamics, without any surface and tropospheric feedbacks in 
  operation (i.e., no secondary effects induced because of changes in tropospheric 
  motions or its thermodynamic state), and with no dynamically-induced changes 
  in the amount and distribution of atmospheric water (vapour, liquid, and solid 
  forms). Note that one potential forcing type, the second indirect effect of 
  aerosols (<a href="160.htm">Chapter 5</a> and <a href="238.htm">Section 6.8</a>), 
  comprises microphysically-induced changes in the water substance. The IPCC usage 
  of the "global mean" forcing refers to the globally and annually averaged 
  estimate of the forcing.</p>
<p>The prior IPCC Assessments as well as other recent studies (notably the SAR; 
  see also Hansen et al. (1997a) and Shine and Forster (1999)) have discussed 
  the rationale for this definition and its application to the issue of forcing 
  of climate change. The salient elements of the radiative forcing concept that 
  characterise its eventual applicability as a tool are summarised in <a href="258.htm">Appendix 
  6.1</a> (see also WMO, 1986; SAR). Defined in the above manner, radiative forcing 
  of climate change is a modelling concept that constitutes a simple but important 
  means of estimating the relative impacts due to different natural and anthropogenic 
  radiative causes upon the surface-troposphere system (see <a href="216.htm#621">Section 
  6.2.1</a>). The IPCC Assessments have, in particular, focused on the forcings 
  between pre-industrial times (taken here to be 1750) and the present (1990s, 
  and approaching 2000). Another period of interest in recent literature has been 
  the 1980 to 2000 period, which corresponds to a time frame when a global coverage 
  of the climate system from satellites has become possible.</p>
<p>We find no reason to alter our view of any aspect of the basis, concept, formulation, 
  and application of radiative forcing, as laid down in the IPCC Assessments to 
  date and as applicable to the forcing of climate change. Indeed, we reiterate 
  the view of previous IPCC reports and recommend a continued usage of the forcing 
  concept to gauge the relative strengths of various perturbation agents, but, 
  as discussed below in <a href="216.htm">Section 6.2</a>, urge that the constraints 
  on the interpretation of the forcing estimates and the limitations in its utility 
  be noted. </p>
