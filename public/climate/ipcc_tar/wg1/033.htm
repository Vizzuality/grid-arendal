<h2>F.6 Projections of Future Changes in Thermohaline Circulation</h2>
<i>Most models show weakening of the Northern Hemisphere Thermohaline Circulation 
(THC), which contributes to a reduction of the surface warming in the northern 
North Atlantic. Even in models where the THC weakens, there is still a warming 
over Europe due to increased greenhouse gases.</i> In experiments where the atmospheric 
greenhouse gas concentration is stabilised at twice its present day value, the 
North Atlantic THC is projected to recover from initial weakening within one to 
several centuries. The THC could collapse entirely in either hemisphere if the 
rate of change in radiative forcing is large enough and applied long enough. Models 
indicate that a decrease of the THC reduces its resilience to perturbations, i.e., 
a once reduced THC appears to be less stable and a shut-down can become more likely. 
However, it is too early to say with confidence whether an irreversible collapse 
in the THC is likely or not, or at what threshold it might occur and what the 
climate implications could be. None of the current projections with coupled models 
exhibits a complete shut-down of the THC by 2100. Although the North Atlantic 
THC weakens in most models, the relative roles of surface heat and fresh water 
fluxes vary from model to model. Wind stress changes appear to play only a minor 
role in the transient response.<br>

<h2>F.7 Projections of Future Changes in Modes of Natural Variability</h2>
<p><i>Many models show a mean El Ni&ntilde;o-like response in the tropical Pacific, 
  with the central and eastern equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures projected 
  to warm more than the western equatorial Pacific and with a corresponding mean 
  eastward shift of precipitation.</i> Although many models show an El Ni&ntilde;o-like 
  change of the mean state of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, the cause 
  is uncertain. It has been related to changes in the cloud radiative forcing 
  and/or evaporative damping of the east-west sea surface temperature gradient 
  in some models. Confidence in projections of changes in future frequency, amplitude, 
  and spatial pattern of El Ni&ntilde;o events in the tropical Pacific is tempered 
  by some shortcomings in how well El Ni&ntilde;o is simulated in complex models. 
  Current projections show little change or a small increase in amplitude for 
  El Ni&ntilde;o events over the next 100 years. However, even with little or 
  no change in El Ni&ntilde;o amplitude, global warming is likely to lead to greater 
  extremes of drying and heavy rainfall and increase the risk of droughts and 
  floods that occur with El Ni&ntilde;o events in many regions. It also is likely 
  that warming associated with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations will cause 
  an increase of Asian summer monsoon precipitation variability. Changes in monsoon 
  mean duration and strength depend on the details of the emission scenario. The 
  confidence in such projections is limited by how well the climate models simulate 
  the detailed seasonal evolution of the monsoons. There is no clear agreement 
  on changes in frequency or structure of naturally occurring modes of variability, 
  such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, i.e., the magnitude and character of 
  the changes vary across the models.</p>

<h2>F.8 Projections of Future Changes in Land Ice (Glaciers, Ice Caps and Ice Sheets), 
  Sea Ice and Snow Cover</h2>
  
<i>Glaciers and ice caps will continue their widespread retreat during the 21st 
century and Northern Hemisphere snow cover and sea ice are projected to decrease 
further.</i> Methods have been developed recently for estimating glacier melt 
from seasonally and geographically dependent patterns of surface air temperature 
change, that are obtained from AOGCM experiments. Modelling studies suggest that 
the evolution of glacial mass is controlled principally by temperature changes, 
rather than precipitation changes, on the global average. <br>
<p><i>The Antarctic ice sheet is likely to gain mass because of greater precipitation, 
  while the Greenland ice sheet is likely to lose mass because the increase in 
  runoff will exceed the precipitation increase. </i>The West Antarctic Ice Sheet 
  (WAIS) has attracted special attention because it contains enough ice to raise 
  sea level by 6 m and because of suggestions that instabilities associated with 
  its being grounded below sea level may result in rapid ice discharge when the 
  surrounding ice shelves are weakened. However, loss of grounded ice leading 
  to substantial sea level rise from this source is now widely agreed to be very 
  unlikely during the 21st century, although its dynamics are still inadequately 
  understood, especially for projections on longer time-scales.</p>
