<h2>Executive Summary </h2>
<p><i>Introduction</i><br>
  This chapter assesses regional climate information from Atmosphere-Ocean General 
  Circulation Models (AOGCMs) and techniques used to enhance regional detail. 
  These techniques have been substantially improved since the IPCC WGI Second 
  Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) and have become more widely applied. 
  They fall into three categories: high and variable resolution Atmosphere General 
  Circulation Models (AGCMs); regional (or nested limited area) climate models 
  (RCMs); and empirical/statistical and statistical/dynamical methods. The techniques 
  exhibit different strengths and weaknesses and their use depends on the needs 
  of specific applications. </p>
<p><i>Simulations of present day climate</i><br>
  Coarse resolution AOGCMs simulate atmospheric general circulation features well 
  in general. At the regional scale the models display area-average biases that 
  are highly variable from region-to-region and among models, with sub-continental 
  area-averaged seasonal temperature biases typically within 4&ordm;C and precipitation 
  biases mostly between -40 and +80% of observations. In most cases, these represent 
  an improvement compared to the AOGCM results evaluated in the SAR.</p>
<p>The development of high resolution/variable resolution AGCMs since the SAR 
  shows that the models' dynamics and large-scale flow improve as resolution 
  increases. In some cases, however, systematic errors are worsened compared with 
  coarser resolution models although only very few results have been documented.</p>
<p>RCMs consistently improve the spatial detail of simulated climate compared 
  to General Circulation Models (GCMs). RCMs driven by observed boundary conditions 
  show area-averaged temperature biases (regional scales of 105 to 106 km2) generally 
  within 2&ordm;C and precipitation biases within 50% of observations. Statistical 
  downscaling demonstrates similar performance, although greatly depending on 
  the methodological implementation and application.</p>
<p><i>Simulation of climate change for the late decades of the 21st century</i></p>
<p><i>Climate means</i><br>
  The following conclusions are based on seasonal mean patterns at sub-continental 
  scales emerging from current AOGCM simulations. Based on considerations of consistency 
  of changes from two IS92a-type emission scenarios and preliminary results from 
  two SRES emission scenarios, within the range of these four scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is very likely that: nearly all land areas will warm more rapidly than 
    the global average, particularly those at high latitudes in the cold season; 
    in Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, northern Asia, and Tibet in winter 
    and central Asia and Tibet in summer the warming will exceed the global mean 
    warming in each model by more than 40% (1.3 to 6.9&deg;C for the range of 
    models and scenarios considered). In contrast, the warming will be less than 
    the global mean in south and Southeast Asia in June-July-August (JJA), and 
    in southern South America in winter.</li>
  <li>It is likely that: precipitation will increase over northern mid-latitude 
    regions in winter and over northern high latitude regions and Antarctica in 
    both summer and winter. In December-January-February (DJF), rainfall will 
    increase in tropical Africa, show little change in Southeast Asia and decrease 
    in central America. There will be increase or little change in JJA over South 
    Asia. Precipitation will decrease over Australia in winter and over the Mediterranean 
    region in summer. Change of precipitation will be largest over the high northern 
    latitudes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Results from regional studies indicate that at finer scales the changes can 
  be substantially different in magnitude or sign from the large area average 
  results. A relatively large spread exists between models, although attribution 
  is unclear.</p>
<p><i>Climate variability and extremes</i><br>
  The following conclusions are based on patterns emerging from a limited number 
  of studies with current AOGCMs, older GCMs and regionalisation studies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Daily to interannual variability of temperature will likely decrease in 
    winter and increase in summer in mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere land areas.</li>
  <li>Daily high temperature extremes will likely increase in frequency as a function 
    of the increase in mean temperature, but this increase is modified by changes 
    in daily variability of temperature. There is a corresponding decrease in 
    the frequency of daily low temperature extremes. </li>
  <li>There is a strong correlation between precipitation interannual variability 
    and mean precipitation. Future increases in mean precipitation will very likely 
    lead to increases in variability. Conversely, precipitation variability will 
    likely decrease only in areas of reduced mean precipitation.</li>
  <li>For regions where daily precipitation intensities have been analysed (e.g., 
    Europe, North America, South Asia, Sahel, southern Africa, Australia and the 
    South Pacific) extreme precipitation intensity may increase.</li>
  <li>Increases in the occurrence of drought or dry spells are indicated in studies 
    for Europe, North America and Australia. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Tropical cyclones</i><br>
  Despite no clear trends in the observations, a series of theoretical and model-based 
  studies, including the use of a high resolution hurricane prediction model, 
  suggest:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is likely that peak wind intensities will increase by 5 to 10% and mean 
    and peak precipitation intensities by 20 to 30% in some regions;</li>
  <li>There is no direct evidence of changes in the frequency or areas of formation.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Recommendations</i><br>
  The material assessed identifies key priorities for future work:</p>
<p>GCMs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continued improvement in GCMs, as their use is fundamental to deriving regional 
    climate information. </li>
  <li>GCM simulations with a greater range of forcing scenarios and an increased 
    ensemble size to assess the spread of regional predictions.</li>
  <li>More assessment of GCM regional attributes and climate change simulations.</li>
  <li>A much greater effort in the evaluation of variability (daily to interannual) 
    and extreme events.</li>
</ul>
<p>RCMs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A more systematic and wide application of RCMs to adequately assess their 
    performance and to provide information for regional scenarios.</li>
  <li>Ensemble RCM simulations with a range of regional models driven by different 
    AOGCM simulations.</li>
  <li>A much greater effort in the evaluation of variability (daily to interannual) 
    and extreme events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Empirical/statistical and statistical/dynamical methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>More regional observations to provide for more comprehensive statistical 
    downscaling functions.</li>
  <li>Much further work to identify the important climate change predictors for 
    statistical downscaling.</li>
  <li>Application of different techniques to a range of AOGCM simulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tropical cyclones:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A greater range of models and techniques for a comprehensive assessment 
    of the future behaviour of tropical cyclones.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cross-cutting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Systematic comparisons of the relative strengths and weak-nesses of techniques 
    to derive regional climate information.</li>
  <li>The development of high-resolution observed climatologies, especially for 
    remote and physiographically complex regions.</li>
  <li>A systematic evaluation of uncertainties in regional climate information.</li>
</ul>
