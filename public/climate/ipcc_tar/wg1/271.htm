<h3>7.2.2 Cloud Processes and Feedbacks </h3>
<h4><a name="7221"></a>7.2.2.1 General design of cloud schemes within climate 
  models</h4>
<p>The potential complexity of the response of clouds to climate change was identified 
  in the SAR as a major source of uncertainty for climate models. Although there 
  has been clear progress in the physical content of the models, clouds remain 
  a dominant source of uncertainty, because of the large variety of interactive 
  processes which contribute to cloud formation or cloud-radiation interaction: 
  dynamical forcing - large-scale or sub-grid scale, microphysical processes 
  controlling the growth and phase of the various hydrometeors, complex geometry 
  with possible overlapping of cloud layers. Most of these processes are sub-grid 
  scale, and need to be parametrized in climate models.</p>
<p> As can be inferred from the description of the current climate models gathered 
  by AMIP (AMIP, 1995; Gates et al., 1999) the cloud schemes presently in use 
  in the different modelling centres vary greatly in terms of complexity, consistency 
  and comprehensiveness. However, there is a definite tendency toward a more consistent 
  treatment of the clouds in climate models. The more widespread use of a prognostic 
  equation for cloud water serves as a unifying framework coupling together the 
  different aspects of the cloud physics, as noted in the SAR. The evolution of 
  the cloud schemes in the different climate models has continued since then.</p>
<p> The main model improvements can be summarised as follows: </p>
<p>(i) Inclusion of additional conservation equations representing different types 
  of hydrometeors<br>
  A first generation of so-called prognostic cloud schemes (Le Treut and Li, 1991; 
  Roeckner et al., 1991; Senior and Mitchell, 1993; Del Genio et al., 1996), has 
  used a budget equation for cloud water, defined as the sum of all liquid and 
  solid cloud water species that have negligible vertical fall velocities. The 
  method allows for a temperature-dependent partitioning of the liquid and ice 
  phases, and thereby enables a bulk formulation of the microphysical processes. 
  By providing a time-scale for the residence of condensed water in the atmosphere, 
  it provides an added physical consistency between the respective simulations 
  of condensation, precipitation and cloudiness. The realisation that the transition 
  between ice and liquid phase clouds was a key to some potentially important 
  feedbacks has prompted the use of two or more explicit cloud and precipitation 
  variables, thereby allowing for a more physically based distinction between 
  cloud water and cloud ice (Fowler et al., 1996; Lohmann and Roeckner, 1996). 
</p>
<p>(ii) Representation of sub-grid scale processes<br>
  The conservation equations to determine the cloud water concentration are written 
  at the scale explicitly resolved by the model, whereas a large part of the atmospheric 
  dynamics generating clouds is sub-grid scale. This is still an inconsistency 
  in many models, as clouds generated by large-scale or convective motions are 
  very often treated in a completely separate manner, with obvious consequences 
  on the treatment of anvils for example. Several approaches help to reconcile 
  these contradictions. Most models using a prognostic approach of cloudiness 
  use probability density functions to describe the distribution of water vapour 
  within a grid box, and hence derive a consistent fractional cover (Smith, 1990; 
  Rotstayn, 1997). An alternative approach, initially proposed by Tiedtke (1993), 
  is to use a conservation equation for cloud air mass as a way of integrating 
  the many small-scale processes which determine cloud cover (Randall, 1995). 
  Representations of sub-grid scale cloud features also require assumptions about 
  the vertical overlapping of cloud layers, which in turn affect the determination 
  of cloud radiative forcing (Jacob and Klein, 1999; Morcrette and Jakob, 2000; 
  Weare, 2000a).</p>
<p>(iii) Inclusion of microphysical processes<br>
  Incorporating a cloud budget equation into the models has opened the way for 
  a more explicit representation of the complex microphysical processes by which 
  cloud droplets (or crystals) form, grow and precipitate (Houze, 1993). This 
  is necessary to maintain a full consistency between the simulated changes of 
  cloud droplet (crystal) size distribution, cloud water content, and cloud cover, 
  since the nature, shape, number and size distribution of the cloud particles 
  influence cloud formation and lifetime, the onset of precipitation (Albrecht, 
  1989), as well as cloud inter-action with radiation, in both the solar and long-wave 
  bands (Twomey, 1974). Some parametrizations of sub-grid scale condensation, 
  such as convective schemes, are also complemented by a consistent treatment 
  of the microphysical processes (Sud and Walker, 1999).</p>
<p> In warm clouds these microphysical processes include the collection of water 
  molecules on a foreign substance (hetero-geneous nucleation on a cloud condensation 
  nucleus), diffusion, collection of smaller drops when falling through a cloud 
  (coalescence), break-up of drops when achieving a certain threshold size, and 
  re-evaporation of drops when falling through a layer of unsaturated air. In 
  cold clouds, ice particles may be nucleated from either the liquid or vapour 
  phase, and spontaneous homogeneous freezing of supercooled liquid drops is also 
  relevant at temperatures below approximately -40&deg;C. At higher temperatures 
  the formation of ice particles is dominated by heterogeneous nucleation of water 
  vapour on ice condensation nuclei. Subsequent growth of ice particles is then 
  due to diffusion of vapour toward the particle (deposition), collection of other 
  ice particles (aggregation), and collection of supercooled drops which freeze 
  on contact (riming). An increase in ice particles may occur by fragmentation. 
  Falling ice particles may melt when they come into contact with air or liquid 
  particles with temperatures above 0&deg;C.</p>
<p> Heterogeneous nucleation of soluble particles and their subsequent incorporation 
  into precipitation is also an important mechanism for their removal, and is 
  the main reason for the indirect aerosol effect. The inclusion of microphysical 
  processes in GCMs has produced an impact on the simulation of the mean climate 
  (Hahmann and Dickinson, 1997).</p>
<p> Measurements of cloud drop size distribution indicate a significant difference 
  in the total number of drops and drop effective radius in the continental and 
  maritime atmosphere, and some studies indicate that inclusion of more realistic 
  drop size distribution may have a significant impact on the simulation of the 
  present climate (Hahmann and Dickinson, 1997).</p>
