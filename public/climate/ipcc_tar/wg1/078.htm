<h4><a name="2522"></a>2.5.2.2 Palaeo-drought </h4>
<p>Palaeoclimate proxy evidence (tree rings, lake sediments 
  and pollen evidence) has been used to estimate variability in drought and precipitation 
  patterns in past centuries. Much of the recent research has emphasised the North 
  American region (e.g., Cook et al., 1999a), where a key conclusion is that the 
  range of regional drought variability observed during the 20th century may not 
  be representative of the larger range of drought evident in past centuries (Laird 
  et al., 1996; Woodhouse and Overpeck, 1998). Hughes and Graumlich (1996) and 
  Hughes and Funkhouser (1999) provide evidence of multi-decadal mega-droughts 
  in the western Great Basin of North America in the 10th to 14th centuries. Nonetheless, 
  the 20th century dust bowl still stands out as the most extreme drought of the 
  past several centuries, the period when North American continental scale reconstruction 
  is possible. Swetnam and Betancourt (1998) argue that recent spring wetness 
  in the American south-west is greater than that observed in at least the last 
  thousand years. Evidence of significant changes in regional hydroclimatic patterns 
  is not limited, however, to North America. Stine (1994) argues that enhanced 
  drought conditions occurred synchronously in South America. Ice accumulation 
  at Quelccaya in the Andes, and on the Dunde Ice Cap on the Tibetan Plateau (Thompson, 
  1996) was slower in the first half of the last millennium than the last 500 
  years, but 500-year averages are not easily related to the palaeo-temperature 
  data (<a href="069.htm#fig221">Figure 2.21</a>). Pollen evidence indicates significant 
  changes in summer rainfall patterns in China in the earlier centuries of the 
  past millennium (Ren, 1998). The relationship between such past changes in regional 
  drought and precipitation patterns, and large-scale atmospheric circulation 
  patterns associated with ENSO, for example, is an area of active current research 
  (e.g., Cole and Cook, 1998). </p>
<h4><a name="2523"></a>2.5.2.3 Ocean </h4>
<p>The strong spatial variability inherent in precipitation requires the use of 
  estimates based on satellite observations for many regions. Thus satellite data 
  are essential to infer global changes in precipitation, as the oceans account 
  for 70% of the global surface area. Since adequate observations were not made 
  until the early 1970s, no satellite-based record is sufficiently long to permit 
  estimates of century-long changes. The first satellite instrument specifically 
  designed to make estimates of precipitation did not begin operation until 1987. 
  At this time three data sets are available: (a) the Global Precipitation Climatology 
  Project (GPCP) product, which spans the period from 1987 to the present (Huffman 
  et al., 1997); (b) the CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) product, 
  covering the period from 1979 to 1998 (Xie and Arkin, 1997); and (c) MSU-derived 
  precipitation estimates since 1979 (Spencer, 1993). While the period from 1987 
  appears to be well observed, it is too short to draw conclusions regarding decadal-scale 
  variations. The longer CMAP data set assumes that the various satellite-derived 
  estimates have no trend over the period, and hence no longer time-scale conclusions 
  are possible. Nonetheless, analyses of the CMAP product and associated data 
  from the NCEP reanalysis project indicate that there have been substantial average 
  increases in precipitation over the tropical oceans during the last twenty years, 
  related to increased frequency and intensity of ENSO (Trenberth et al., 2001). 
  ENSO conditions are not related to positive precipitation anomalies everywhere 
  over the tropical oceans (e.g., south-western Tropical Pacific).</p>
