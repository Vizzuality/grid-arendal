<h3>9.1.2 New Types of Model Experiments since 1995 </h3>
<p>The progression of experiments including additional forcings has continued 
  and new experiments with additional greenhouse gases (such as ozone, CFCs, etc., 
  as well as CO<sub>2</sub>) will be assessed in this chapter. </p>
<p>In contrast to the two global coupled climate models in the 1990 Assessment, 
  the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) (Meehl et al., 2000a) includes 
  output from about twenty AOGCMs worldwide, with roughly half of them using flux 
  adjustment. Nineteen of them have been used to perform idealised 1%/yr CO<sub>2</sub>-increase 
  climate change experiments suitable for direct intercomparison and these are 
  analysed here. Roughly half that number have also been used in more detailed 
  scenario experiments with time evolutions of forcings including at least CO<sub>2</sub> 
  and sulphate aerosols for 20th and 21st century climate. Since there are some 
  differences in the climate changes simulated by various models even if the same 
  forcing scenario is used, the models are compared to assess the uncertainties 
  in the responses. The comparison of 20th century climate simulations with observations 
  (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>) has given us more confidence in the abilities 
  of the models to simulate possible future climate changes in the 21st century 
  and reduced the uncertainty in the model projections (see <a href="500.htm">Chapter 
  14</a>). The newer model integrations without flux adjustment give us indications 
  of how far we have come in removing biases in the model components. The results 
  from CMIP confirm what was noted in the SAR in that the basic patterns of climate 
  system response to external forcing are relatively robust in models with and 
  without flux adjustment (Gregory and Mitchell, 1997; Fanning and Weaver, 1997; 
  Meehl et al., 2000a). This also gives us more confidence in the results from 
  the models still using flux adjustment. </p>
<p>The IPCC data distribution centre (DDC) has collected results from a number 
  of transient scenario experiments. They start at an early time of industrialisation 
  and most have been run with and without the inclusion of the direct effect of 
  sulphate aerosols. Note that most models do not use other forcings described 
  in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 6</a> such as soot, the indirect effect of sulphate 
  aerosols, or land-use changes. Forcing estimates for the direct effect of sulphate 
  aerosols and other trace gases included in the DDC models are given in <a href="212.htm">Chapter 
  6</a>. Several models also include effects of tropospheric and stratospheric 
  ozone changes.</p>
<p>Additionally, multi-member ensemble integrations have been run with single 
  models with the same forcing. So-called "stabilisation" experiments 
  have also been run with the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations increasing 
  by 1%/yr or following an IPCC scenario, until CO<sub>2</sub>-doubling, tripling 
  or quadrupling. The greenhouse gas concentration is then kept fixed and the 
  model integrations continue for several hundred years in order to study the 
  commitment to climate change. The 1%/yr rate of increase for future climate, 
  although larger than actual CO<sub>2</sub> increase observed to date, is meant 
  to account for the radiative effects of CO<sub>2</sub> and other trace gases 
  in the future and is often referred to as "equivalent CO<sub>2</sub>" 
  (see discussion in <a href="344.htm#921">Section 9.2.1</a>). This rate of increase 
  in radiative forcing is often used in model intercomparison studies to assess 
  general features of model response to such forcing.</p>
