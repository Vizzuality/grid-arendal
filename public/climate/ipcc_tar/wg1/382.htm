<h2>10.3 Regional Attributes of AOGCMs </h2>
<h3><a name="1031"></a>10.3.1 Simulations of Current Climate </h3>
<h4><a name="10311"></a>10.3.1.1 Mean climate</h4>
<p>Although current AOGCMs simulate well the observed global pattern of surface 
  temperature (see <a href="308.htm">Chapter 8</a>), at the regional scale substantial 
  biases are evident. To give an overview of the regional performance of current 
  models, results are presented of Giorgi and Francisco (2000b), who compared 
  model and observed seasonal mean temperature and precipitation averaged for 
  the regions indicated in <a href="#fig101">Figure 10.1</a>. The AOGCM experiments 
  they considered were a selection of those available through the IPCC Data Distribution 
  Centre (DDC) and included single simulations using the CSIRO Mk2, CCSR/NIES 
  and ECHAM/OPYC models, a three-member ensemble of CGCM1 simulations and a four-member 
  ensemble of HadCM2 simulations (see <a href="347.htm#tab91">Table 9.1</a> for 
  further model details). <a href="#fig102">Figure 10.2</a> shows the biases in 
  regionally averaged seasonal mean surface temperature and precipitation for 
  1961 to 1990 using as reference the gridded analysis of New et al. (1999). Nearly 
  all regional temperature biases are within the range of &plusmn;4&deg;C. The 
  main exceptions to this are negative biases of more than 5&deg;C in some models 
  over Asia in DJF. Precipitation biases are mostly between -40 and +80%, with 
  the exception of positive biases in DJF in excess of 100% over central America 
  (CAM), northern Africa (WAF and SAH), Alaska (ALA), and some parts of Asia (EAS, 
  SAS, TIB and NAS). The regional biases of <a href="#fig102">Figure 10.2</a> 
  are, in general terms, smaller than those of a similar analysis presented in 
  the SAR (see also Kittel et al., 1998) which, for example, showed regional temperature 
  biases as high as 10 to 15&deg;C in some models and regions. Given that the 
  current analysis also includes many more regions, this difference in general 
  performance strongly suggests that simulation of surface climate at the sub-continental 
  scale is improved in current generation AOGCMs. </p>

<p>Current generation AOGCM simulations in which historical changes in climate 
  forcing over the 20th century are used enable simulated regional climatic trends 
  to be assessed against observations. This was done by Boer et al. (2000a) for 
  temperature and precipitation for the regions of southern Europe, North America, 
  Southeast Asia, Sahel and Australia (defined as in the SAR) using the CGCM1 
  model. Simulated and observed regional linear temperature trends agreed for 
  all regions, except the Sahel, when sulphate forcing was included. Little could 
  be said about agreement in observed and model precipitation trends as these 
  trends were weak over the period in both the model and the observations. </p>
<p>It should be stressed that assessments of model regional performance based 
  on area-averaging of AOGCM output over broad regularly-shaped regions should 
  not be assumed to apply to all areas within these regions. Many of the regions 
  considered contain a number of distinct climate regimes, and model performance 
  may vary considerably from regime to regime. For the purpose of assessing model 
  performance in a particular region, more detailed analysis is appropriate. </p>
<p>Where studies have examined spatial patterns within regions (e.g., Joubert 
  and Tyson, 1996; Labraga and Lopez, 1997; Lal et al., 1998a), reasonable correspondence 
  with observations was found, especially for temperature and mean sea level pressure 
  (MSLP). Most studies focus on seasonal mean conditions, but models can be analysed 
  to focus on simulation of specific climate features. For example, Arritt et 
  al. (2000) examined circulation and precipitation patterns associated with the 
  onset of the North American monsoon in simulations with the HadCM2 model, and 
  found this feature to be well simulated. Some studies have identified important 
  errors in current simulations of regional MSLP, such as the tendency for pressure 
  to be too low over Europe and too high north and south of this area (Machenhauer 
  et al., 1998). Such errors contribute significantly to local temperature and 
  precipitation biases both in the global climate model and in nested high-resolution 
  RCM simulations (Risbey and Stone, 1996; Machenhauer et al., 1998; Noguer et 
  al., 1998). </p>
<p>As would be expected, GCM simulations of current climate are often poor at 
  the local scale (e.g., Schubert, 1998). However, in areas without complex topography, 
  it is possible for the model results at individual grid points to compare well 
  with observations (Osborn et al., 1999).</p>
