<a name="figspm5"></a>Models have been used to make projections 
of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and hence of future 
climate, based upon emissions scenarios from the IPCC Special Report on Emission 
Scenarios (SRES) (<a href="#figspm5">Figure 5</a>). These scenarios 
were developed to update the IS92 series, which were used in the SAR and are shown 
for comparison here in some cases. <br>
<h4>Greenhouse gases</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> due to fossil fuel burning are virtually certain7 
    to be the dominant influence on the trends in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
    during the 21st century.<br>
    <br>
  <li>As the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of the atmosphere increases, ocean and 
    land will take up a decreasing fraction of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 
    The net effect of land and ocean climate feedbacks as indicated by models 
    is to further increase projected atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, 
    by reducing both the ocean and land uptake of CO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
    <br>
  <li>By 2100, carbon cycle models project atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
    of 540 to 970 ppm for the illustrative SRES scenarios (90 to 250% above the 
    concentration of 280 ppm in the year 1750), <a href="#figspm5">Figure 
    5b</a>. These projections include the land and ocean climate feedbacks. Uncertainties, 
    especially about the magnitude of the climate feedback from the terrestrial 
    biosphere, cause a variation of about -10 to +30% around each scenario. The 
    total range is 490 to 1260 ppm (75 to 350% above the 1750 concentration).<br>
    <br>
  <li>Changing land use could influence atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. 
    Hypothetically, if all of the carbon released by historical land-use changes 
    could be restored to the terrestrial biosphere over the course of the century 
    (e.g., by reforestation), CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would be reduced by 
    40 to 70 ppm.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Model calculations of the concentrations of the non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse 
    gases by 2100 vary considerably across the SRES illustrative scenarios, with 
    CH<sub>4</sub> changing by -190 to +1,970 ppb (present concentration 1,760 
    ppb), N<sub>2</sub>O changing by +38 to +144 ppb (present concentration 316 
    ppb), total tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> changing by -12 to +62%, and a wide 
    range of changes in concentrations of HFCs, PFCs and SF<sub>6</sub>, all relative 
    to the year 2000. In some scenarios, total tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> would 
    become as important a radiative forcing agent as CH<sub>4</sub> and, over 
    much of the Northern Hemisphere, would threaten the attainment of current 
    air quality targets. <br>
    <br>
  <li>Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the gases that control their 
    concentration would be necessary to stabilise radiative forcing. For example, 
    for the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon cycle models indicate 
    that stabilisation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations at 450, 650 
    or 1,000 ppm would require global anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to 
    drop below 1990 levels, within a few decades, about a century, or about two 
    centuries, respectively, and continue to decrease steadily thereafter. Eventually 
    CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would need to decline to a very small fraction of 
    current emissions. <br>
</ul>
<h4>Aerosols</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The SRES scenarios include the possibility of either increases or decreases 
    in anthropogenic aerosols (e.g., sulphate aerosols (<a href="#figspm5">Figure 
    5c</a>), biomass aerosols, black and organic carbon aerosols) depending on 
    the extent of fossil fuel use and policies to abate polluting emissions. In 
    addition, natural aerosols (e.g., sea salt, dust and emissions leading to 
    the production of sulphate and carbon aerosols) are projected to increase 
    as a result of changes in climate.<br>
</ul>
<h4>Radiative forcing over the 21st century</h4>
<ul>
  <li>For the SRES illustrative scenarios, relative to the year 2000, the global 
    mean radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases continues to increase through 
    the 21st century, with the fraction due to CO<sub>2</sub> projected to increase 
    from slightly more than half to about three quarters. The change in the direct 
    plus indirect aerosol radiative forcing is projected to be smaller in magnitude 
    than that of CO<sub>2</sub>. <br>
</ul>
<h3>Global average temperature and sea level are projected to rise under all IPCC 
  SRES scenarios.</h3>
In order to make projections of future climate, models incorporate past, as well 
as future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Hence, they include estimates 
of warming to date and the commitment to future warming from past emissions.<br>
<h4>Temperature</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The globally averaged surface temperature is projected to increase by 1.4 
    to 5.8&deg;C (<a href="#figspm5">Figure 5d</a>) over the period 
    1990 to 2100. These results are for the full range of 35 SRES scenarios, based 
    on a number of climate models<small><sup><a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#10","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' >10</a>, 
    <a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#11","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;'>11</a></sup></small>.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Temperature increases are projected to be greater than those in the SAR, 
    which were about 1.0 to 3.5&deg;C based on the six IS92 scenarios. The higher 
    projected temperatures and the wider range are due primarily to the lower 
    projected sulphur dioxide emissions in the SRES scenarios relative to the 
    IS92 scenarios.<br>
    <br>
  <li>The projected rate of warming is much larger than the observed changes during 
    the 20th century and is very likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    to be without precedent during at least the last 10,000 years, based on palaeoclimate 
    data.<br>
    <br>
  <li>By 2100, the range in the surface temperature response across the group 
    of climate models run with a given scenario is comparable to the range obtained 
    from a single model run with the different SRES scenarios. <br>
    <br>
  <li>On timescales of a few decades, the current observed rate of warming can 
    be used to constrain the projected response to a given emissions scenario 
    despite uncertainty in climate sensitivity. This approach suggests that anthropogenic 
    warming is likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    to lie in the range of 0.1 to 0.2&deg;C per decade over the next few decades 
    under the IS92a scenario, similar to the corresponding range of projections 
    of the simple model used in <a href="#figspm5">Figure 5d</a>.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Based on recent global model simulations, it is very likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    that nearly all land areas will warm more rapidly than the global average, 
    particularly those at northern high latitudes in the cold season. Most notable 
    of these is the warming in the northern regions of North America, and northern 
    and central Asia, which exceeds global mean warming in each model by more 
    than 40%. In contrast, the warming is less than the global mean change in 
    south and southeast Asia in summer and in southern South America in winter.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Recent trends for surface temperature to become more El Ni&ntilde;o-like 
    in the tropical Pacific, with the eastern tropical Pacific warming more than 
    the western tropical Pacific, with a corresponding eastward shift of precipitation, 
    are projected to continue in many models.<br>
</ul>
<h4>Precipitation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Based on global model simulations and for a wide range of scenarios, global 
    average water vapour concentration and precipitation are projected to increase 
    during the 21st century. By the second half of the 21st century, it is likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    that precipitation will have increased over northern mid- to high latitudes 
    and Antarctica in winter. At low latitudes there are both regional increases 
    and decreases over land areas. Larger year to year variations in precipitation 
    are very likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup>7</sup></small></a> 
    over most areas where an increase in mean precipitation is projected. 
</ul>
<h4>Extreme Events</h4>
<p><a href="#tabspm1">Table 1</a> depicts an assessment of confidence 
  in observed changes in extremes of weather and climate during the latter half 
  of the 20th century (left column) and in projected changes during the 21st century 
  (right column)<sup>a</sup>. This assessment relies on observational and modelling 
  studies, as well as the physical
  plausibility of future projections across all commonly-used scenarios and is 
  based on expert judgement<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup> 
  7</sup></small></a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For some other extreme phenomena, many of which may have important impacts 
    on the environment and society, there is currently insufficient information 
    to assess recent trends, and climate models currently lack the spatial detail 
    required to make confident projections. For example, very
    small-scale phenomena, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail and lightning, 
    are not simulated in climate models.</li>

<h4>El Ni&ntilde;o</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confidence in projections of changes in future frequency, amplitude, and 
    spatial pattern of El Ni&ntilde;o events in the tropical Pacific is tempered 
    by some shortcomings in how well El Ni&ntilde;o is simulated in complex models. 
    Current projections show little change or a small increase in amplitude for 
    El Ni&ntilde;o events over the next 100 years.</li>
  <li>Even with little or no change in El Ni&ntilde;o amplitude, global warming 
    is likely7 to lead to greater extremes of drying and heavy rainfall and increase 
    the risk of droughts and floods that occur with El Ni&ntilde;o events in many 
    different regions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Monsoons</h4>
<ul>
  <li>It is likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup> 
    7</sup></small></a> that warming associated with increasing greenhouse gas 
    concentrations will cause an increase of Asian summer monsoon precipitation 
    variability. Changes in monsoon mean duration and strength depend on the details 
    of the emission scenario. The confidence in such projections is also limited 
    by how well the climate models simulate the detailed seasonal evolution of 
    the monsoons.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Thermohaline circulation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Most models show weakening of the ocean thermohaline circulation which leads 
    to a reduction of the heat transport into high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. 
    However, even in models where the thermohaline circulation weakens, there 
    is still a warming over Europe due to increased greenhouse gases. The current 
    projections using climate models do not exhibit a complete shut-down of the 
    thermohaline circulation by 2100. Beyond 2100, the thermohaline circulation 
    could completely, and possibly irreversibly, shut-down in either hemisphere 
    if the change in radiative forcing is large enough and applied long enough.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Snow and ice</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Northern Hemisphere snow cover and sea-ice extent are projected to decrease 
    further.</li>
  <li>Glaciers and ice caps are projected to continue their widespread retreat 
    during the 21st century.</li>
  <li>The Antarctic ice sheet is likely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup> 
    7</sup></small></a> to gain mass because of greater precipitation, while the 
    Greenland ice sheet is likely7 to lose mass because the increase in runoff 
    will exceed the precipitation increase.</li>
  <li>Concerns have been expressed about the stability of the West Antarctic ice 
    sheet because it is grounded below sea level. However, loss of grounded ice 
    leading to substantial sea level rise from this source is now widely agreed 
    to be very unlikely<a href="Footnote" onClick='window.open("fnspm.htm#7","Footnote","scrollbars,width=350,height=300");return false;' ><small><sup> 
    7</sup></small></a> during the 21st century, although its dynamics are still 
    inadequately understood, especially for projections on longer time-scales.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sea level</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Global mean sea level is projected to rise by 0.09 to 0.88 metres between 
    1990 and 2100, for the full range of SRES scenarios. This is due primarily 
    to thermal expansion and loss of mass from glaciers and ice caps (<a href="008.htm#figspm5">Figure 
    5e</a>). The range of sea level rise presented in the SAR was 0.13 to 0.94 
    metres based on the IS92 scenarios. Despite the higher temperature change 
    projections in this assessment, the sea level projections are slightly lower, 
    primarily due to the use of improved models, which give a smaller contribution 
    from glaciers and ice sheets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Anthropogenic climate change will persist for many centuries.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases (i.e., CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, 
    PFCs, SF<sub>6</sub>) have a lasting effect on atmospheric composition, radiative 
    forcing and climate. For example, several centuries after CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
    occur, about a quarter of the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration caused 
    by these emissions is still present in the atmosphere.</li>
  <li>After greenhouse gas concentrations have stabilised, global average surface 
    temperatures would rise at a rate of only a few tenths of a degree per century 
    rather than several degrees per century as projected for the 21st century 
    without stabilisation. The lower the level at which concentrations are stabilised, 
    the smaller the total temperature change.</li>
  <li>Global mean surface temperature increases and rising sea level from thermal 
    expansion of the ocean are projected to continue for hundreds of years after 
    stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations (even at present levels), owing 
    to the long timescales on which the deep ocean adjusts to climate change.</li>
  <li>Ice sheets will continue to react to climate warming and contribute to sea 
    level rise for thousands of years after climate has been stabilised. Climate 
    models indicate that the local warming over Greenland is likely7 to be one 
    to three times the global average. Ice sheet models project that a local warming 
    of larger than 3&deg;C, if sustained for millennia, would lead to virtually 
    a complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet with a resulting sea level rise 
    of about 7 metres. A local warming of 5.5&deg;C, if sustained for 1,000 years, 
    would be likely7 to result in a contribution from Greenland of about 3 metres 
    to sea level rise.</li>
  <li>Current ice dynamic models suggest that the West Antarctic ice sheet could 
    contribute up to 3 metres to sea level rise over the next 1,000 years, but 
    such results are strongly dependent on model assumptions regarding climate 
    change scenarios, ice dynamics and other factors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Further action is required to address remaining gaps in information and understanding.</h3>
<p>Further research is required to improve the ability to detect, attribute and 
  understand climate change, to reduce uncertainties and to project future climate 
  changes. In particular, there is a need for additional systematic and sustained 
  observations, modelling and process studies. A serious concern is the decline
  of observational networks. The following are high priority areas for action.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Systematic observations and reconstructions: 
    <ul>
      <li> Reverse the decline of observational networks in many parts of the 
        world.</li>
      <li>Sustain and expand the observational foundation for climate studies 
        by providing accurate, long-term, consistent data including implementation 
        of a strategy for integrated global observations.</li>
      <li>Enhance the development of reconstructions of past climate periods.</li>
      <li>Improve the observations of the spatial distribution of greenhouse gases 
        and aerosols.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Modelling and process studies: 
    <ul>
      <li>Improve understanding of the mechanisms and factors leading to changes 
        in radiative forcing.</li>
      <li>Understand and characterise the important unresolved processes and feedbacks, 
        both physical and biogeochemical, in the climate system.</li>
      <li>Improve methods to quantify uncertainties of climate projections and 
        scenarios, including long-term ensemble simulations using complex models.</li>
      <li>Improve the integrated hierarchy of global and regional climate models 
        with a focus on the simulation of climate variability, regional climate 
        changes and extreme events.</li>
      <li>Link more effectively models of the physical climate and the biogeochemical 
        system, and in turn improve coupling with descriptions of human activities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Cutting across these foci are crucial needs associated with strengthening international 
  co-operation and co-ordination in order to better utilise scientific, computational 
  and observational resources. This should also promote the free exchange of data 
  among scientists. A special need is to increase the observational and research 
  capacities in many regions, particularly in developing countries. Finally, as 
  is the goal of this assessment, there is a continuing imperative to communicate 
  research advances in terms that are relevant to decision making.</p>

    <td class="box"> <p><b>The Emissions Scenarios of the Special Report on Emissions 
        Scenarios (SRES)</b></p>
      <p>A1. The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of 
        very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century 
        and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient 
        technologies. Major underlying themes are convergence among regions, capacity 
        building and increased cultural and social interactions, with a substantial 
        reduction in regional differences in per capita income. The A1 scenario 
        family develops into three groups that describe alternative directions 
        of technological change in the energy system. The three A1 groups are 
        distinguished by their technological emphasis: fossil intensive (A1FI), 
        non-fossil energy sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources (A1B) 
        (where balanced is defined as not relying too heavily on one particular 
        energy source, on the assumption that similar improvement rates apply 
        to all energy supply and end use technologies).</p>
      <p>A2. The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous 
        world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local 
        identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which 
        results in continuously increasing population. Economic development is 
        primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and technological 
        change more fragmented and slower than other storylines.</p>
      <p>B1. The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world 
        with the same global population, that peaks in mid-century and declines 
        thereafter, as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid change in economic 
        structures toward a service and information economy, with reductions in 
        material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient 
        technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social 
        and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without 
        additional climate initiatives.</p>
      <p>B2. The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the 
        emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability. 
        It is a world with continuously increasing global population, at a rate 
        lower than A2, intermediate levels of economic development, and less rapid 
        and more diverse technological change than in the B1 and A1 storylines. 
        While the scenario is also oriented towards environmental protection and 
        social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels.</p>
      <p>An illustrative scenario was chosen for each of the six scenario groups 
        A1B, A1FI, A1T, A2, B1 and B2. All should be considered equally sound.</p>
      <p>The SRES scenarios do not include additional climate initiatives, which 
        means that no scenarios are included that explicitly assume implementation 
        of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or the emissions 
        targets of the Kyoto Protocol.</p></td>
