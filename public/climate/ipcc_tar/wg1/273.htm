<h4>7.2.2.3 Boundary-layer mixing and cloudiness</h4>
<p>Turbulent motions affect all exchanges of heat, water, momentum and chemical 
  constituents between the surface and the atmosphere, and these motions are also 
  responsible for the mixing processes inside the atmospheric boundary layer. 
  Consequently, the turbulent motions impact on the formation and existence of 
  fog and boundary-layer clouds such as cumulus, stratocumulus and stratus. Cumulus 
  is typically found in fair weather conditions over land and sea, while layers 
  of stratocumulus and stratus can be found in subsidence areas such as the anticyclonic 
  areas in the eastern part of the sub-tropical oceans, or the polar regions.</p>
<p> The atmospheric boundary layer with clouds is typically characterised by a 
  well-mixed sub-cloud layer of order 500 metres, and by a more extended conditionally 
  unstable layer with boundary-layer clouds up to 2 km. The latter layer is very 
  often capped by a temperature inversion. If the clouds are of the stratocumulus 
  or stratus type, then conservative quantities are approximately well mixed in 
  the cloud layer. The lowest part (say 10%) of the sub-cloud layer is known as 
  the surface layer. In this layer the vertical gradients of variables are normally 
  significant, even with strong turbulent mixing. Physical problems associated 
  with the surface layer depend strongly on the type of surface considered (such 
  as vegetation, snow, ice, steep orography) and are treated in the corresponding 
  sub-sections. We note that the surface characteristics do impact on the formation 
  of boundary-layer clouds, because of the turbulent mixing inside the boundary 
  layer.</p>
<p> Atmospheric models have great difficulty in the proper representation of turbulent 
  mixing processes in general. This also impacts on the representation of boundary-layer 
  clouds. At present, the underprediction of boundary-layer clouds is still one 
  of the most distinctive and permanent errors of AGCMs. This has been demonstrated 
  through AMIP intercomparisons by Weare and Mokhov (1995) and also by Weare (2000b). 
  It has a very great importance, because the albedo effect of these clouds is 
  not compensated for by a significant greenhouse effect in both clear-sky and 
  cloudy conditions.</p>
<p> The persisting difficulty in simulation of observed boundary layer cloud properties 
  is a clear testimony of the still inadequate representation of boundary-layer 
  processes. A variety of approaches is followed, ranging from bulk schemes in 
  which the assumption of a well-mixed layer is made a priori, to discretised 
  approaches considering diffusion between a number of vertical layers. Here the 
  corresponding diffusion coefficients are being computed from dimensional analysis 
  and observational data fitted to it. The use of algorithms based on the prognostic 
  computation of turbulent kinetic energy and higher-order closure hypotheses 
  is also becoming more common and new schemes continue to be proposed (Abdella 
  and McFarlane, 1997). A critical review and evaluation of boundary-layer schemes 
  was recently made by Ayotte et al. (1996). They found that all schemes have 
  difficulty with representing the entrainment processes at the top of even the 
  clear boundary layer. </p>
<p> Important and still open problems include the decoupling between the turbulence 
  at the surface and that within clouds, the non-local treatment of semi-convective 
  cells (thermals) that can transport heat and substances upward, the role of 
  moist physics, and microphysical aspects (Ricard and Royer, 1993; Moeng et al., 
  1995; Cuijpers and Holtslag, 1998; Grenier and Bretherton, 2001). Several studies 
  (Moeng et al., 1996; Bretherton et al., 1999; Duynkerke et al., 1999) show that 
  column versions of the climate models may predict a reasonable cloud cover in 
  response to observed initial and boundary conditions, but have more difficulty 
  in maintaining realistic turbulent fluxes. The results are also very dependent 
  on vertical resolution and numerical aspects (Lenderink and Holtslag, 2000). 
  This points to the need for new approaches for boundary-layer turbulence, both 
  for clear-sky and cloudy conditions which are not so sensitive to vertical resolution 
  (see also contributions in Holtslag and Duynkerke, 1998).</p>
