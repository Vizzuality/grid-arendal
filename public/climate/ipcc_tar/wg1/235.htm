<h3>6.7.5 Biomass Burning Aerosol</h3>
<p>Biomass burning aerosol consists of two major chemical components: black carbon 
  (BC), which primarily absorbs solar radiation, and organic carbon (OC), which 
  primarily scatters solar radiation. Sources of biomass burning aerosol include 
  burning of forests and savanna for colonisation and agriculture, burning of 
  agricultural waste, and substances burned for fuel such as wood, dung and peat. 
  Not all biomass aerosol comes from anthropogenic activities, as naturally occurring 
  vegetation fires regularly occur. The fraction of anthropogenic biomass aerosol 
  remains difficult to deduce. As for sulphate and fossil fuel BC aerosol, three-dimensional 
  GCM estimates (e.g., Penner et al., 1998b) have superseded earlier simple box-model 
  calculations (e.g., Penner et al., 1992) (see <a href="233.htm#tab65">Table 
  6.5</a>). Penner et al. (1998b) and Grant et al. (1999) used a GCM to model 
  the radiative forcing from biomass aerosol, finding a combined total radiative 
  forcing of -0.14 to -0.23 Wm<sup>-2</sup> depending upon the mixing assumptions and size 
  distributions used. The radiative forcing is calculated to be negative over 
  the majority of the globe, but some limited areas of positive forcing exist 
  over areas with a high surface reflectance (see <a href="253.htm#6142">Section 
  6.14.2</a>). The seasonal cycle is strongly influenced by the seasonal cycle 
  of biomass burning emissions (Grant et al., 1999; Iacobellis et al., 1999), 
  the global mean being estimated to be a maximum during June/July/August. Hobbs 
  et al. (1997) performed aircraft measurements of smoke from biomass burning 
  during the Smoke Cloud and Radiation-Brazil (SCAR-B) experiment and used the 
  model of Penner et al. (1992) to estimate a global mean radiative forcing of 
  -0.3 Wm<sup>-2</sup> as an approximate upper limit due to modified optical parameters. 
  Ross et al. (1998) performed a similar measurement and modelling study estimating 
  a local annual mean radiative forcing of -2 to -3 Wm<sup>-2</sup> in intensive biomass 
  burning regions, indicating that the global mean radiative forcing is likely 
  to be significantly smaller than in Penner et al. (1992). Iacobellis et al. 
  (1999) model the global radiative forcing as -0.7 Wm<sup>-2</sup> but use an emission factor 
  for biomass aerosols that Liousse et al. (1996) suggest is a factor of three 
  too high, thus a radiative forcing of -0.25 Wm<sup>-2</sup> is more likely. These estimates 
  neglect any long-wave radiative forcing although Christopher et al. (1996) found 
  a discernible signal in AVHRR data from Brazilian forest fires that opposes 
  the short-wave radiative forcing; the magnitude of the long-wave signal will 
  depend upon the size, optical parameters, and altitude of the aerosol.</p>
<p>The radiative effects of the individual BC and OC components from biomass burning 
  have also received attention. Haywood and Ramaswamy (1998) re-scaled the global 
  column burden of BC from Cooke and Wilson (1996) to that of Liousse et al. (1996) 
  which is thought to be more representative of optically active BC and estimated 
  the radiative forcing due to fossil fuel and biomass burning to be approximately 
  +0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, approximately half of which, or +0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, is due to biomass sources. 
  Hansen et al. (1998) adjusted the single scattering albedo of background aerosols 
  from unity to 0.92 to 0.95 to account for the absorbing properties of BC from 
  combined fossil fuel and biomass emissions and found a radiative forcing of 
  +0.27 Wm<sup>-2</sup>.</p>
<p>The radiative forcing due to the purely scattering OC component from combined 
  fossil fuel and biomass emissions is estimated by Hansen et al. (1998) to be 
  -0.41 Wm<sup>-2</sup> with a approximate upper limit for the radiative forcing due to fossil 
  fuel OC from this study of approximately -0.16 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (see <a href="234.htm">Section 
  6.7.4</a>). Thus an approximate weakest limit for the radiative forcing due 
  to biomass burning OC is -0.25 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. Jacobson (2001) used a multi-component 
  aerosol model to investigate the radiative forcing due to OC from combined fossil 
  fuel and biomass aerosols using emissions from Liousse et al. (1996) finding 
  a resultant radiative forcing of between -0.04 and -0.06 Wm<sup>-2</sup>, the 
  strongest forcing being for purely scattering aerosol. The small radiative forcings 
  of Jacobson (2001) may be due to the aerosol being modelled as tri-modal with 
  less aerosol in the optically active region of the spectrum, or due to the fact 
  that absorption by BC may be enhanced in the modelled multi-component mixture.</p>
<p>On the basis of these studies, the estimate of the radiative forcing due to 
  biomass burning aerosols remains the same at -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. The uncertainty associated 
  with the radiative forcing is very difficult to estimate due to the limited 
  number of studies available and is estimated as at least a factor of three, 
  leading to a range of -0.07 to -0.6 Wm<sup>-2</sup>.</p>
