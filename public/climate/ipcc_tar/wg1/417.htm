<h4>11.2.3.3 Numerical modelling</h4>
<p>Modelling of the past history of the ice sheets and their underlying beds over 
  a glacial cycle is a way to obtain an estimate of the present ice-dynamic evolution 
  unaffected by short-term (annual to decadal) mass-balance effects. The simulation 
  requires time-dependent boundary conditions (surface mass balance, surface temperature, 
  and sea level, the latter being needed to model grounding-line changes). Current 
  glaciological models employ grids of 20 to 40 km horizontal spacing with 10 
  to 30 vertical layers and include ice shelves, basal sliding and bedrock adjustment.

<p>Huybrechts and De Wolde (1999) and Huybrechts and Le Meur (1999) carried out 
  long integrations over two glacial cycles using 3-D models of Greenland and 
  Antarctica, with forcing derived from the Vostok (Antarctica) and Greenland 
  Ice Core Project (GRIP) ice cores. The retreat history of the ice sheet along 
  a transect in central west Greenland in particular was found to be in good agreement 
  with a succession of dated moraines (Van Tatenhove et al., 1995), but similar 
  validation elsewhere is limited by the availability of well-dated material. 
  Similar experiments were conducted as part of the European Ice Sheet Modelling 
  Initiative (EISMINT) intercomparison exercise (Huybrechts et al., 1998). These 
  model simulations suggest that the average Greenland contribution to global 
  sea level rise has been between -0.1 and 0.0 mm/yr in the last 500 years, 
  while the Antarctic contribution has been positive. Four different Antarctic 
  models yield a sea level contribution of between +0.1 and +0.5 mm/yr averaged 
  over the last 500 years, mainly due to incomplete grounding-line retreat of 
  the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (<a href="#fig113">Figure 
  11.3</a>). However, substantial uncertainties remain, especially for the WAIS, 
  where small phase shifts in the input sea level time-series and inadequate representation 
  of ice-stream dynamics may have a significant effect on the model outcome. Glacio-isostatic 
  modelling of the solid earth beneath the Antarctic ice sheet with prescribed 
  ice sheet evolution (James and Ivins, 1998) gave similar uplift rates as those 
  presented in Huybrechts and Le Meur (1999), indicating that the underlying ice 
  sheet scenarios and bedrock models were similar, but observations are lacking 
  to validate the generated uplift rates. By contrast, Budd et al. (1998) find 
  that Antarctic ice volume is currently increasing at a rate of about 0.08 mm/yr 
  of sea level lowering because in their modelling the Antarctic ice sheet was 
  actually smaller during the LGM than today (for which there is, however, little 
  independent evidence) and the effect of the higher accumulation rates during 
  the Holocene dominates over the effects of grounding line changes. </p>
<p>Model simulations of this kind have not included the possible effects of changes 
  in climate during the 20th century. The simulations described later (<a href="429.htm#11511">Section 
  11.5.1.1</a>), in which an ice sheet model is integrated using changes in temperature 
  and precipitation derived from AOGCM simulations, suggest that anthropogenic 
  climate change could have produced an additional contribution of between -0.2 
  to 0.0 mm/yr of sea level from increased accumulation in Antarctica over the 
  last 100 years, and between 0.0 and 0.1 mm/yr from Greenland, from both increased 
  accumulation and ablation. The model results for Greenland exhibit substantial 
  interannual variability. Furthermore, because of rising temperatures during 
  the 20th century, the contribution for recent decades is larger than the average 
  for the century. These points must be borne in mind when comparing with results 
  of the direct observation methods for short periods in recent decades (<a href="416.htm#11231">Sections 
  11.2.3.1</a> and <a href="416.htm#11232">11.2.3.2</a>). Note also that the observational 
  results include the ongoing response to past climate change as well as the effect 
  of 20th century climate change. </p>
